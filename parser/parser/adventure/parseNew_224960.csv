												11.8 hours.. I Completely forgot how long and hard this old school advanture game is like.To HYPE up my self prepare for the new tomb raider that's coming out.. I decided to replay this.What an advanture! I did complete this game about 20 years ago and this time I did it in 1 go....When I solving those puzzle so many unexpect childhood memory that I have long forgotten flow back to me and that's a wondful experience.A Master piece and all time classic.However I can only recommend this to old school fan.since:1. Control is hard and less responsive and hard to manage then newer Tomb raider game.2. Music is good but lack variety of new generation of games.3. Graphics has aged quite a bit and younger kids now days won't like it any more.4. Have to save and load way too offen cause this game is really really hard and sometime there are multiple hard jumps. if you don't want to lose your progress.. Save Offen!Anyhow for rating...For old time classic 10/10. For modern day enjoyment 7.5/10			"

												The classic that started it all...Tomb Raider is a solid, well designed action-adventure game with gameplay that is just the right amount of precise and just the right amount of varied. Each level feels like an entirely new challenge, both in terms of gameplay and in terms of fiction, it feels awesome. The fact that the game is beautiful, has such a gripping environment and protagonist is simply a fantastic coincidence that adds to it’s quality. I’d recommend this to just about anyone, once you get past the Minecraft-like graphics it feels just as modern as any game today, this game and its first few sequels are indeed timeless classics.9/10			"

												Good game, Terrible port. It uses DosBOX (really steam?). It plays in native resolution with no option for widescreen either. If you get it in a bundle fine, but I wouldn't recommend paying for it.UDATE: Also the game does not include the soundtrack music, it feels really bland. I followed this thread

Using an emulator like DosBOX is ridiculous. By the way, the DosBOX version included is outdated.			"

												The first Tomb Raider from 1996 still entertains with fun puzzles, varied level design and a quite easy yet at the same time challenging combat system. After playing this game from start to end about seven times I can honestly say that this game is a must have for every Tomb Raider fan and a should have for every adventure-fan.Added bonus: Getting this game to run on a computer that's not from the nineties can be quite difficult... but Steam made it all happen on my computer automatically! I was quite happy that it was that simple!			"

												What else can possibly be said about one of the most famous video games of all time?Graphically, yes, by today's standards the low polygon count (dem triangle boobies) and the square-based geometry is laughable, but back in '96, this was top-notch. Levels and textures are repetitive, though, especially caves and the like. Funnily enough, Lara's house and Natla's mines, two of the least ""tomb-like"" areas in the game provide the most variety and definitely look the best. The character and enemy models themselves, although blocky, look great and are well textured.Sound-wise, I'm not sure why this game slipped under the radar for camp voice acting. Some of Natla's lines are on par with the likes of Barry's ""Jill sandwich"". In all seriousness though, the ambient sound and music (where available; unfortunately the game is stripped of most of Nathan McCree's beautiful compositions from the PlayStation version) coupled with the sharp blasts of gunfire and Lara's various grunts (and hilarious screams) makes this one of the best sounding games I've played.But these just supplement the best part of the game; the gameplay and controls themselves. The eloquent and just right mix of platforming, puzzle-solving and exploding-mummy shooting provide constant and consistent variety; you're never bored playing this game. Lara's various techniques are easy to perform thanks to the very tight controls; it's easy to predict where Lara will land, if she will grab onto the right ledge, and if she'll take damage from a fall. In fact, it would be not too hard a task to complete the whole game without dying. The precision of the controls combined with the square tiles mean you can pretty much always calculate a jump, which in turn means that it's absolutely your fault every single time that you plummet to your painful, neck-breaking death. The difficulty and length are also just right. The learning curve is magnificent, gradually building up the difficulty and length with each level. It took me 15 hours to pass 15 levels (the 3 extra hours were starting over and over, as I tend to do), which is amazing for an action-adventure game.There is only a few nitpicks I have here, and none of these to do with the game itself, but with Steam's pretty lacklustre effort in making it compatible with modern operating systems. This game is a c-word to get working on modern systems. I remember buying the Red Ant retail version of Unfinished Business back in 2000 and crying (I was 4 then) because it wouldn't run properly on Windows 2000. So, needless to say, it's annoying to get working. So while I do give kudos to Steam (or rather GOG and DOSbox as they're the ones who did all the actual work), some very grating issues persist. For one, each time a cutscene plays (pre-rendered FMVs) I have to alt-enter, and alt-tab, and watch it windowed, otherwise it won't play. And there's a 50%ish chance that DOSBox will crash each time I alt-tab, so that's kind of irritating. Also, if you close the game other than using the in-game exit button, the gamma of the game will translate to your actual machine. Meaning that if you had just started a level and gamma was higher than say, when the screen was fading out after completing a level, your computer will have an annoyingly bright display until it's restarted. Not sure if this happens to anyone else though, so it's not a major issue. Finally, why weren't the Unfinished Business bonus levels or the music included as well? There's an awesome guide on the game's Steam Community which adds these extras, but it's baffling as to why they aren't included by default.

In the end, the awesome original game is still there, and it does save a lot of infuriating trial-and-error getting it to work on a modern system. I heartily recommend this game to anyone who likes amazing games. I'd wait until the Tomb Raider pack is on sale though, so you can play its many, many sequels as well (including the new, shiny survival game with lots of DLCs!). It often goes on sale for $20ish bucks, which is 10 games in one bundle. A shame it doesn't include Guardian of Light!4.5/5			"

												No matter how you put it, what you remember the most about a game is the atmosphere. And all those 90's kids who played Tomb Raider back in the days just can't forget how they felt being this badass curvy version of Indiana Jones, roaming the caves, jungles and deserts by themselves, desecrating temples and tombs with two guns as best friends. Of course, the game seems way too easy now, the graphics are terrible and Lara has never been less attractive but to live once again these sensations, the thrilling chills when the t-rex appears, the little screams every time you fall into one of these traps you could have sworn you knew by heart, a good old merciless cold-hearted heroin who doesn't give a damn, now that's freakin' priceless!

												You start up the game and one thing is very clear: This game is -old-.Being way too spoiled with the modern games with their fancy smooth controls, getting used to how this game works takes a little time, but you'll get the hang of it eventually. Once you do, there's a great adventure waiting for you under the clunky gameplay and the blocky aesthetics. The puzzles are occasionally quite clever, and some of the areas are pretty well designed.What the PC version does better than, say, the PlayStation version, is that you can save anywhere you like. However, this version has no music in it at all. Only ambient background sounds.If you like the Tomb Raider series, a nostalgic trip back to the first game might not be such a bad idea. Be sure to get it when it's cheap, though, because I have a hard time recommending it full-price unless you're a die-hard fan.			"

												The game was the most difficult at the time I began playing, it's the best platform type of game you can play and enjoy at the same time, storyline is great, gameplay is great, as for graphics, we all know this is an old school classic, that has probably almost two decades, the game is huge so you can expect the game to last more than a day compared to all new other games that come out there in the market nowadays, it's worth having it on your game library, definitely.Childhood's first game I've played for the first Playstation, the memories are very strong, as soon as I played this game, a dozen of things came to my mind, reminding me how being young and not having responsabilities is such a great and happy time of our lives.

												The game that started it all. it might seem primitive by today's standards, but believe it or not - it's still mind boiling and fun to play even today. If you're reading this then you've definitely already heard about the series, so there's not much of a point to recommend. It's a must play category title with great level design and soundtrack. The game takes place in 4 differently themed locations (so it doesn't get boring), each location has at least 3 levels. There's also a free expansion pack called ""Unfinished Business"" that has 4 extra levels (PC exclusive).While TR is certainly not a realistic game (finding medipacks and ammo in tombs) I couldn't imagine it being different. You have to sacrifice a bit of realism to keep the game fun and entertaining. For the most hard working / curious explorers each level has at least one secret. Depending on the secret you may get ammo, medipacks or even a new weapon (early access in a way).The PC version isn't as good as the PlayStation version, considering that the PC version was released for DOS it lacks some features. It runs through DosBox, resolution can be increased but it's not the best experience. Everything is fixable as long as you're using 3rd party software such as Glidos. It enhances the game visually and also restores it's original audio quality. You can play it at pillarboxed 1080p without any problems at all.			"

												I used to play this on the PS1 back in the day and it is probably my all time favorite game. When i saw it on steam i had to get it, man.. i thought the controls would suck a lot worse but five minutes in Lara's mansion and im just as good as using the old PS1 controller. I love the graphics they bring me back to 1996 where there were no hints or someone to hold your hand like all the games today. You would just spend days exploring, getting scared when an enemy pops out of nowhere and accasually need to use a guide to figure out what the hell you are doing. This was a time when games seem to have more love put into them. Dam might as well buy the next two soon too, the games today just don't excite me anymore.			"

												Obviously this is a classic, so we know the game is good.This is a port that runs on DOSBox, which isn't too bad, but it does require some configuration.The DOSBox settings are located in steamapps\Tomb Raider (I)\dosboxTR.conf. The file can be opened with a text editor like Notepad++. The main settings I changed:fullresolution=1920x1080 (your screen resolution)
output=opengl

aspect=true
I think changing the output to opengl from direct3d fixed the issue with DOSBox crashing when tabbing out of the window.The other thing I did was install nGlide using  this guide .As for controls, although this game works with a keyboard I think it is more fluid with a controller. I've been using a steam controller and have had almost no issues (there are a variety of community controller profiles for this game).Happy raiding!			"

Posted: June 22, 2015
												What most people remember from this ancient relic of a title - fast approaching its twentieth anniversary at the time of writing - is an unassuming level called the Lost Valley. Ms Croft, far from the first female video game protagonist but arguably the most influential, runs through a short cave system not dissimilar to that of the opening levels, and gracefully swan dives into a pool from the very top of a waterfall. As Lara, you indiscriminately kill a few wolves, and then you find yourself in this expansive, jungle-like environment. The pitch black darkness above - the result of hardware limitations at the time - was intended to imply an outdoor, night time environment. It doesn’t quite pull it off, and you might feel like you’re still in a cave, miles underground, shrubs and trees inexplicably growing all around you. One thing’s for sure, though - you’re entirely alone. But not for long. Two creatures attack, on top of you so quickly you hardly have time to register it. You push on, hoping there’s not more of them - the earlier Tomb Raider games had a genuine fear factor to them, a genuine sense of vulnerability - and just as you’re about to pass under a broken bridge, wondering what might have caused such destruction, the screen starts to shake. The tense musical cue kicks in*, and then it appears. A huge polygon monstrosity roars at you with not-quite CD quality sound, and then it’s up to you - fight or flight. What makes this so notable a moment in the present day is that the Lost Valley was the third level of a fifteen level game. The Tyrannosaurus Rex does not act as a bookend for the game, or even for the level itself. It is not part of some grand set piece, or even an epic boss fight - provided you can avoid the damn thing’s jaws, a gunfight will last about twenty seconds, and yes, you can even beat the level without killing it at all. What we have here is game design from an era where things weren’t focus-tested into banality, when developers implemented outstandingly memorable moments without basing an entire game around it. A T-Rex in Level Three suggests a time when developers could, in short, do close to whatever they wanted. Dinosaurs wandering around Peru? Well, sure, why the hell not? Jurassic Park had come out three years prior, and dinosaurs were the next big thing in entertainment. It didn’t necessarily make a lot of sense for Tomb Raider, from a contextual standpoint or a gameplay standpoint, but somehow, it worked. And Tomb Raider’s full of moments like that - our heroine’s making her way through a mutant-infested Atlantis, complete with fleshy, pulsating walls, and then she enters what appears to be… an underground skateboard park? And sure enough, someone’s riding towards her, skateboard under his feet, twin Uzis in his hands, spitting out a remark that seem to be an almost-quote from Taxi Driver (“You firing at me? You firing at me?!”). These days are long gone. If you’re going to put dinosaurs in a game, dinosaurs have to *make* the game. You certainly can’t go putting a T-Rex in the third level. And forget murderous skaters altogether. You’d have half your audience scratching their heads. For better or for worse, consistency and logic are cornerstones of modern gaming - triple A and indie alike, I’d argue - and the times when developers could truly put an idea in their game “just because” are over. For those who can handle the archaic controls and dated visuals**, Tomb Raider remains well worth playing today. More recent Tomb Raider titles provide the same exotic locations and eclectic blend of platforming, exploration and combat as the original, but they often feel like you’re strapped into the seat of a rollercoaster - it's frequently breathtaking, but you're very much on a set path. For that reason, it’s the original 1996 release that has me coming back whenever I want a fix of the exotic, the surreal, and the often downright bizarre. Tomb Raider. Come for the dinosaurs. Stay for the gun-totting skateboarder. *Strangely, this Steam version of Tomb Raider seems to lack musical cues such as the one signalling the appearance of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I’m not sure if this is my setup, but other cues, such as Lara’s voiceovers during the tutorial in her mansion home, play fine. **The Steam version of Tomb Raider provides the smoothest graphical setup I’ve seen for the game, providing texture qualities not far removed from late-generation PS1 games, or even early Dreamcast titles. Unfortunately, it also introduces occasional screen tearing, clipping and pop-up/draw distance issues.			"

												Tomb Raider 1 is hands down the closest game to my heart. It's what got me to buy a Playstation and enter the world of the action/adventure genre. I loved that the lead character was female. I loved the graphics and the music that sucked you into another world. I loved the satisfaction you felt when you figured out a difficult puzzle or found every single secret on a level. I have played this game a bazillion times and it never gets old. Actually, knowing every little detail of the game from the PS1 version but having to learn how to play it on the keyboard is a fun challenge. Additional Note: I've played through about half of TR1 on the PC and I've noticed a lack of the lovely music from the PS1 version. However, you can more clearly hear atmospheric noise such as wind howling, rocks shifting, water trickling through ducts, certain animal noises, etc. I miss the music but I'm enjoying the background noises.Second Addition: I'm very proud of myself. It's no easy task to play Tomb Raider using only the keyboard but I was determined. And actually, I got a lot more proficient at using the keyboard to control her than I thought would be the case. I just beat the game with 100% of the secrets under my belt and I had a lot of fun. No matter how old it gets, Tomb Raider 1 will always be an amazing game.Last Addition: This game does not take as many hours to beat as I have clocked. I just tend to play it on a regular basis since, for me, it's therapeutical.			"

												If you buy this game you will learn the basic and amazing story line of Lara Croft, the Tomb Raider busty cute girl! Buying some of the latest Tomb Raider games for most casual gamers, will find it hard to explore and is a steep learning curve. This game however, is more primative for casual gamers to help explore and understand which routes or pathways they take - as the latest Tomb Raider games contain complex controls and a lot of cryptic clues and mysteries.Sometimes - despite the training in Croft Manor, players tend to get stuck in Level 2 when they fail to realise that Lara can push or pull blocks, in Level 2 with the collapsing platforms in a pit.So if you want to learn more on Tomb Raider, start off with this game!

I encountered a couple of bugs, the main one where bacon doppelganger Lara got stuck on the platform a few times, but nothing major to fix it.

First thing you need to realize for some who do not know is that there are no mouse controls. Everything is played on a keypad (it took a few hours before I realized how exactly the controls worked and I still never mastered it but I still managed to beat the game)The game can be extremely unforgiving but if you take your time and save often you can be surprised on how much you fun you can still have with this game.I recommend this game only to those who want a real challenge while reliving a gaming classic, I bought in a huge bundle pack for mere cents totally worth it.

I Thrashed Tomb Raider 1 back in the day on my ps1 but now it’s really starting to show its age.You join Lara Croft on her first adventure to recover an ancient artefact known as the Scion. Along the way Lara must kill lots of endangered and extinct animals, from Wolves, Lions and Bats through to Dinosaurs. Using 4 gun types (her trademark pistols, shotgun, Uzi’s and magnums)It was a great game back in the day but now it’s quite dated and I would only recommend it to people who ether played it back in the day and want at trip down memory lane, people who love classic 3d action platformers or hard core Tomb fans. If you don't fit in those groups of people might want to consider getting Tomb Raider Anniversary (for more info about that title check out my Tomb Raider Anniversary review) :)			"

Legendary game, terrible port. Lacks part of the original soundtrack, the Unfinished Business expansion and proper controller support. Can become decent if you are willing to heavily tweak it by yourself. If you never played this game before I definitely recommend it, but I suggest not buying this version unless you get it in the Tomb Raider collection package or are prepared to take your time and fix it. Look elsewhere for a proper one.

			This guide covers:    Restoring the  Playstation music  that is absent from the Steam version of Tomb Raider.  Installing the expansion pack  Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business .		


The ""port"" (if it can even be defined a port) is, to put it simply, inexcusably bad. Whoever worked on this has been extremely lazy and should be slapped in the face once for every diseased copy spread into the gaming community. Basically it's just the original game untouched and bundled with an outdated DosBox emulator. And that's all. No custom settings interface, no tweaks for modern hardware and OS, no proper controller support, nothing. So much for putting effort in your work.The software defaults to a 640x480 resolution, so low that it actually manages to make the Steam interface an hindrance, other than barely usable. It will instantly crash if you tab out of the game or use the Windows key or in any way take the focus away from the software's window. To change those settings you have to go out of your way, dig into your Steam games folder and tweak DosBox's configuration files manually, they just couldn't bother to spend 10 minutes and make a dedicated configuration launcher like many other games. Cheap-skates.The original PC version used to lack some of the wonderful musical tracks that instead came with the console version, and guess what: they didn't bother to bundle in the missing tracks either. They are available freely on the internet and you just need to copy them in the game's folder, but apparently this was too much for them. A plus of the PC version instead were the extra levels added by the Unfinished Business expansion, later included in a ""Gold"" edition of the game. Needless to say, they couldn't care less to include those extra levels either. Fortunately they are available for free like the missing soundtracks but you have to thinker a little to add them to this copy. You can find guides to do so (together with extra tweaks) within the Steam community guides section.Lastly, there is no proper controller support. Not only that, if you actually try to use your good old Xbox 360 controller using one of the many remappers available to mimic the original experience you used to have when you were a kid, prepare for the worst: the original game does not support analog controllers, the port does not fix that, and the Xbox 360 controller's directional buttons are, let's say, not very good for precise 4-direction movement. These factors combine together to create terrible movement controls. It is literally impossible to even walk straight for more than 3 seconds without mashing the poor directional buttons. This is actually a combination of issues and not solely the port's, but still, it couldn't get any worse and they couldn't care less to at least fix that. All said and done, this port is dogsh*t.EDIT: Got my hands on a Xbox One controller which has an excellent D-pad, enough to make this game finally playable with a controller. Port is still inexcusably bad though, and still can't recommend it.			"

												While Tomb Raider (1996) is a fantastic classic action adventure title, the steam port of this game is awful. However, there are a few of great mods available for the game which make it very playable on a Windows 10 PC. These files can be found here: http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=214779http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=217552Basically, with these mods installed, Tomb Raider 1 will run nativly on windows 10 with real widescreen, patched music and FMV's, high resolutions and increased draw distance and better water FX. HD FMVs which are higher quality than the ones in the link above can be found here:http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=216973] An optional braid mod for lara can also be found here: http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=209369.Gameplay: The gameplay hold up fairly well by modern standards if you take the time to adjust to the tank controls. During the game you will be left to your own devices to explore large open levels finding keys, ammo, health packs and secrets. exploration is this games strongpoint if you hadn't guessed by the title. the action side of the game holds up pretty well to. there is no manual aiming, just auto aim which works fine for a game of this time. there are many types of weapons to choose from such as the shotgun, uzi's, magnums and of course, Lara's trademark pistols. you will be fighting mainly wild animals such as bears and wolfs but you will also face human enemies sent to kill you and even some mutants which are still creepy even today.Overall, the gameplay is fun challenging and great for people who like games mainly focused on puzzles and exploration with some gunplay thrown in.Graphics: they are terrible, obviously. this is a 1996 game what did you expect? they were great for their time but now its just a mash up of blocky low poly enviroments and blurry textures. thankfully, the textures can be replaced with some HD textures and the draw distance can be extended with the mods above however, the blocky low poly enviroments remain. Also, the the FMV's look pretty bad too even compared to it's sequel Tomb Raider 2 but atleast the HD FMV mod helps a lot to make them clearer and sharper. look to Tomb Raider Anniversary if you want better graphics.Sound: Once again, thanks to the mod above we can fully enjoy Nathan Mccree's amazing soundtrack which previously wasn't possible due to the original PC port of this game not including most of the soundtrack. The music in Tomb Raider is very nice and fits the game perfectly.Overall, Tomb Raider 1 is a fun retro game with good gameplay and a great soundtrack that you can pick for a few pennies on a Steam sale. Recommended IMO. And also I promise this is not an ad for the mod I posted. I just happen to think it's really awesome and without it I wouldn't bother buying the steam port becuase what steam gives you is just a crappy Dosbox port.			"

												Reviewing a 20 year old game (seriously, 20 years old) is pretty hard. Compared to today's standard of controls, graphics and music - yeah the PC version shipped without in game music - Tomb Raider is obviously lacking. I can only recommend this game to those who have already played it or those who know they can cope with the limitations that come with a 2 decade old game. Gameplay - The level design in Tomb Raider is fantastic with some truly memorable set pieces and enemies. Secret areas are hidden well and the game offers a decent degree of challenge. Flipping through the air with dual pistols auto locked onto the wolves running at you is rather satisfying. The only thing letting the game down at the moment is...Controls - Not the worst I've ever used but I certainly remember it being easier on a PS1 controller a very long time ago. On PC and in comparison to today's standards, the controls in Tomb Raider are clunky, difficult to use and incredibly good at♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. When you're getting through a timed jumping puzzle and fall to your death only because of the painful control scheme, you can only feel betrayed. Oh, and the swimming controls are about as useful as pedals on a wheelchair. Graphics/sound design - I really like old school graphics and Tomb Raider looks very old school. It might be offputting to some, but I personally think it doesn't look that bad. In terms of sound, well there's no music. And the sound assets that do exist get rather repetitive. I stopped playing after about 4 levels just due to the controls. I'll finish it if I ever get around to picking up a Dualshock 4 (assuming I can use one for this game, I haven't found out)Overall, Tomb Raider truly is a classic. Looking past its new-age issues it still stands up on its own and it's still really fun. It's not for everyone, but I do think everyone should try it first. It might surprise you. 3/54/5 with nostalgia			"

												The game itself I love. It's a game I beat in 1996 on the PS1. It's a classic. Crystal Dynamics & Square on the other hand should be ashamed of themselves. Here we are on the 20th Anniversary of TR and you need Dosbox to run the first classic game on Steam? Which is basically emulation. Then they insult us by releasing TR1 on Android that is ported properly to run on modern machines. All they have to do is update TR1 to run that version on Steam. Do they do this? No, apparently they don't care.			"

												I have always enjoyed Puzzle Platform games, yet I never found the time, nor the means to try a Tomb Raider game and see if it deserves its nearly 20 year old glory. I decided to give the experience a try with the original game, and I must say, I am more than satisfied. The complexity of every single level and the abscence of a map drives you to think for yourself, and challenges your sense of direction. Puzzles are neatly put, containing subtle references to mythological elements of the setting. Combats are present only to add to the atmosphere rather than presenting actual action so far, but action element has always been optional in Puzzle Platforms for me. I find the game to be brilliant, well-thought and challenging both for its age, and present. The original title is self explanatory for the series fame and success.			"

												One of the first games I ever played and one that has stuck in my memory as one of the most unique and unforgettable games that I have ever palyed. (review may be influenced by nostalgia)Pros:-Level design and progression is done expertly with plenty of variety-Challenging and does not insult your intelligence by offering help-Character of Lara has got to be one of the most iconic in the industry for sure, you get very immersed in this character and kind of forget that you are Lara, in a good way-Soundtrack is great and ambient sounds are done very well-This game makes you feel very alone (this is hard to get right as it can easily be a bad thing if devs don't nail it)-Visually impressive for its age (1996 I think?)-Has a memorable and unique aesthetic Cons:-I never really understood the story, but I didn't really care anyway the game was good enough as it was-People who have a low threshold for frustration and rage might not like this gamePS. If you don't get the story, it doesn't matter you will still enjoy this game regardless (kind of like Thief)			"

												Even 20 years after it's first release, this game is still deep in my heart. The graphics and sounds might be outdated, but for real fans of the franchise, it all started with this one.It's still difficult enough, if you wanna do and try some challenges. And it's still getting love on Twitch, even in 2016.If you have never played it, or maybe only played the latest Tomb Raider games ... go and try this one. It won't hurt :) Experience the magic, how it all started.			"

If you change controls, DosBox crashes.If you minimize the game, DosBox crashes.DosBox cannot be customized.Tomb Raider is still just as good as I remember it 15 years ago. Puzzles are as challenging as any modern game. I can't recommend this game on Steam because of the rubbish emulator though.			"

												The first, and definitely still one of the best. I don't think I need to sing its praises too much. The Steam port runs on DOSBox, so it comes with a few issues that may bother you, but these are easily fixable and the community is super helpful about it. The lack of music can also be fixed with a mod, and the Gold exclusive levels can also be downloaded free and legally from the official site and made to launch from Steam. Overall, DOSBox can be a blessing in disguise if you're willing to work with it, so don't let it discourage you. Read up on some community guides and ask the forumites for help if necessary. Or, if you'd rather not bother, there is also a guide to play it without DOSBox, and there is also a multipatch you can find that installs the Gold expansion levels and your choice of soundtrack, hassle-free.Being the first game in a successful series, it shares the same quality as many other great firsts in gaming history, and there's certainly nothing wrong with it, but the sequels did build on it and raise the bar, so anyone who played those first might find the original a bit lacking in some areas. For one thing, TR1 was made to run on the SEGA Saturn, so the performance is a bit slower than TR2-TR5, and Lara's ponytail is missing because the Saturn simply couldn't handle it. The weapon selection is also limited, as 3 of the 4 weapons are clearly tiered upgrades over each other, the shotgun being the odd one out with strategic uses. There is also no dynamic lighting, so the game is mostly brightly lit with a few rare dark areas you can't really do anything about. The sound design is also more basic. There aren't specific sounds for Lara's footsteps on each type of texture. If these all sound like nitpicks, it's because they are. Where this game truly shines is in its level design, and the environments that are fun to just explore, even when you're stuck. Tomb Raider the first is a great game, and you should play it... but if you're new to the series, you definitely shouldn't stop here.			"

												I remember that great time when I was playing Tomb Raider I. And you know what? I still have fun. And many many great memories come back. And now, I wanna play Anniversary (I have it). You want to know that time I grew up? Play Tomb Raider. You'll understand why Lara Croft became that icon (it's not only the boobs, guys and girls).As a girl, having a female main character that is using her brains is very refreshing. Lara Croft has really left her mark on me. Lara Croft is an adventurer/archaeologist, contacted by Jacqueline Natla to retrieve an artifact called the Scion, in Peru. And that's how Lara began her journey through Peru to the lost city of Atlantis.Tomb Raider is a mix of adventure/shooter. Playing in a third person perspective, you control easily Lara, despite some weirds camera movement. You have weapons to defend yoursef against animals like wolves, bats, lions, gorillas.... and the famous T-Rex. In that first game, Lara doesn't really face humans apart for Natla's men (and they're not in majority).But generally, you're running, jumping, swimming from a point to another because you have keys to find or levers to use to open doors. And if you're hurt, you can find health kits. As for the weapons, the pistols have infinite ammo.The soundtrack is good and the ambient sounds are also a huge factor: you hear it when you're in a cavern.Keep in mind that Tomb Raider I is the 1996 game. Back then, these graphics were really good. Even if Lara's boobs are not...well, round. But you know when you're in Egypt: between a Sphinx and hieroglyphs and sand...True, Anniversary is taking some liberties and is a remake of Tomb Raider I. True, Anniversary may be better than Tomb Raider I. But while I prefer Anniversary, Tomb Raider I will be forever as one of these games that marked me with Doom II, Colonize, Age of Empires and Half-Life.I may be not the avid fan of Lara Croft, I grew up too. But she will be forever in my heart. She will be forever that female character that made me finally feel like I was at my place as a girl playing video games.			"

												Tomb Raider 1, despite its simple graphics, is one of the best in the entire series. It has all the components you'd expect in a good action-adventure game. The game balances action, platforming, and shooting extremely well. It is not too simple either, I've died multiple times, either by badly timed jumps or difficult enemies.I've had a solid 17 hours of casual fun for €1,40 only. I would highly recommend people to try out TR1 and find out why back in the day this game was such a giant success.			"

												Tomb Raider I, the game that started it all.Fun, beautiful game from the past that still lives up to today's expectations with gameplay and enjoyment.Gameplay+ Fun puzzles+ Exploration- Jumping/Climbing can be difficult simply because of the controls- Sometimes quite frustratingThe gameplay is what you would expect, auto target combat, puzzles, climbing, jumping, and exploration. It truly is a Tomb Raider game, and the first of its kind. However it can be frustrating, mainly because of how difficult it can be controlling Lara and the camera not lining up.Graphics/Sound+ Beautiful, nostalgiclooking+ Nice audioI won't go too much into the graphics, seeing as it is an older game and obviously could not live up to today's games standards. It still makes you feel like you're on an adventure, and tombs still look daunting. It is an old game, so don't expect to be blown away by the audio or visual aspects of the game, however they are still pleasing.Controls+ Controls can be remapped- Difficult, and frustrating- Terrible cameraThe problem with Tomb Raider I is the controls. They are very confusing, and I suggest you remap them to the WASD, space bar, E controls that are common today. Traversal can be irritating, and the camera often isn't facing the right way, making some jumps unnecessarily hard.Despite this, it can still be fun to play. Yes some of the jumps are difficult and can take you multiple tries to simply get up a ledge, but despite this, it is still an enjoyable game.Overall/Quick ReviewTomb Raider I is a fun, nostalgic leap into the past where you can experience the game that started one of the best series in gaming history. Fun gameplay and interesting story, but sometimes the controls and camera can make the game more frustrating and irritating than fun and enjoyable.If you want to play this game, but worry about the controls and camera issues, being how it is older, pick up Tomb Raider Anniversary. It is an almost exact remake of this game, with better gameplay, easier controls, and roughly the same level design. Recommended for any Tomb Raider fans, old or new.Fun game that takes you back to your childhood.Buy it.MANDATORYSUGGESTIONS BEFORE YOU PLAYI highly recommend you follow this link, and do as it says. It makes the game less buggy, crash less, look better, and simply just improve the game overall.


Visual Improvements 
A Guide for Tomb Raider I
By: Xazuki

			You may want to use this guide if:     You want to increase the resolution of Tomb Raider up to your largest supported resolution.		


Remap the controls to the usual WASD to move, E to interact, space to jump, and so on before you play, as the default controls will feel clunky and difficult. Don't jump and then hit E (interact) to climb up! Simply hold E and W, and Lara will jump up and grab, and climb up by herself. It makes the game much less frustrating and easier to control. It took me a long time to learn this.SAVE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLERight before a hard jump, save. After you make that jump, SAVE If you fall you can simply reload and try again without having to start back from the very beginning. It makes the game far less infuriating and much more enjoyable.Note: If you do not save before you die in the beginning of the game, you will be sent back to the main menu and have to restart all over, including remapping the controls. Save as soon as possible. "

												This game is a classic. It was great at the time, and like any classic I believe it still is now. I finished it once again, twenty years later (ah, these school skipping mornings in pj's...), so buying it on Steam is not only for nostalgia!It is an action-adventure platformer, in old basic 3D, with a very basic story... Said honestly? This game has a dull story and ugly graphics... but who cares! It is in no case a masterpiece, but I sincerely think it put some foundations for the future of gaming (that is, our present, almost our recent past now).I do recommend for fans, but would new gamers or young people enjoy it? I don't think so.			"

												A good start for the Tomb Raider franchise and truly a great game on its own, successfully incorporating exploration, adventure, platforming and shooting!The game makes you really feel like an explorer, a female Indiana Jones of sort, as the levels are really vast for a ~300MB game, quite a feat actually. Some levels were so big that I got lost a few times, made worse by the fact that there is no in-game map! Many secret areas are available as well.The weapon arsenal isn't really that huge (pistols with unlimited ammo, shotgun, magnums and Uzis), but it's fine for this type of game, which focuses on exploration more than shooting. Not having a weapon reload function also helps concentrate more on that.There are many enemies as well, from wolves and evil henchmen to raptors (and a lone T-Rex! Felt really good fighting it!) and supernatural monsters.As for the graphics, which also brings me to recommending or not this game, I have to say that they are good enough for a 1996 game, but, having said that, modern gamers accustomed to today's graphics will probably not like this (the gameplay also feels obsolete for today's standards).An expansion pack was also made available for PC (called Unfinished Business, which features 4 additional levels), but is not present in the Steam version, as well as the original Playstation game's music (which is a letdown, since the Steam version's in-game music is almost non-existent, while the Playstation one added a lot to the atmosphere), but thankfully I found this guide which fixes both those issues. I advise new players to read it before starting the game.Having said all that, I fully recommend this game for fans of exploration, adventure and a bit of shooting, taken with a grain of retro salt!

												A true classic. My first PC game. Anyone looking for a game resembling (THE FANTASTIC) reboot, This game may not be for you. Tomb raider has really evolved over the years, and I can say I have enjoyed every step of the way. while TR1 may not have the non stop action pacing of this generations adventure, nothing beats triangle boobs and searching for keys in this nostalgia filled gem. glad steam gave me a plave to scratch an old itch, giving me a chance to dust off them old pistolas.

												Going back to the original Tomb Raider, I expected my experience to be brief and purely nostalgia driven. My only memories of playing the game when I was younger are ones of frustration at the controls and an infantile infatuation with Lara Croft which probably kept me playing a lot longer than I should have.What I found however, was a pretty solid, 3D action-adventure game that holds up way better than I thought it would. The controls can feel counter-intuitive at first but once you get a basic understanding of how it all works, It starts to work pretty well, at least for a game that was designed before the advent of dual analogue sticks.The game has you exploring various environments, encountering traps, enemies and platforming puzzles along the way. It's pretty simple. Levels will often show you a door requiring multiple keys and leave you to explore the surrounding area in search of them. The game doesn't offer much guidance for locating these keys and that's what really drew me in. Being left alone to explore an area with just a compass (which I'm pretty sure has no in game use) and two guns with no immediate direction provided a very liberating sense of exploration that I haven't felt in a video game for years. It'll require a little patience and maybe looking at a walkthrough a handful of times but there is absolutley a good time to be had with Tomb Raider 1 in 2016.			"

RATING9/10GOODEverything is execellent, this is a pure classic, I played this long ago and to be honest I can't remember graphics looking this good, I'm really enjoying it on PC, if you're a Tomb Raider fan consider picking this one up, you won't be disappointed, it's kinda old some of you might say, but trust me this is one of the best Tomb Raider games ever created. Altho there are no things to loot, things to craft all fancy stuff available in newer Tomb Raider games, I still found this much more enjoyable than newer ones for some reason. One thing that I really love about this game is that you can just sit back, relax and enjoy the game.BADThe only reason this is 9/10 and not 10/10 are these little technical issues, like crashing while using higher resolutions than 1024x768 in DOSBox conf. Everything else is fine, I didn't experience any crashes while playing it. One more thing is lack of mouse support, I'd really like to be able observing and looking around without pressing additional button to do so, but in the end who cares?			"

												This is an absolute classic and recommend it to anyone. It is also a great way to see how far we have come. The only issue I had with this game is I could not get it working on a modern ATI card however my Nvidia cards worked like a charm. Cheers!			"

												I am playing this again after many years and enjoying every footstep taken.  I played it all the way through in two days at the time of release in 1996 and was hooked on the series ever since.  A classic game in every sense of the word, this is part of your gaming history and I urge anyone that has never played it to spend a few pounds on this and relive the magic.			"

												I spent a tons of my precious time playing this awesome triangle texture game. It provided me a lot of fun in levels like City of Vilcabamba, Colosseum,  Palace Midas, Cistern, Tomb of Tihocan, Obelisk of Khamoon, Natla's Mines, Atlantis. There are  45 secrect places, 4 type of weapons, a lot of enemies like bats, gorillas, wolf, lions, flying mutans etc; advanced and complicated levels, many puzzles, fun bugs. When I launched the game my memories take me back when I was 6 years old; it's very nostalgic and worth all money. I advice only for those who are missing good old games.10/10			"

												Really only recommended to people who want to play it for nostalgia purposes. No controller support and if you want to play it with a controller, there are a million hoops that you must jump through first. In addition, the pc controls themself, because this thing runs on DOS box, are trash. It literally forces you to use one hand to play the entire game, but on the bright side, you can use your free hand to multitask while you struggle to remember archaic controls on the number pad that some keyboards don't even have anymore. Someone needs to make some sort of update for this to make the pc controls better or provide some sort of controller support for this game to actually be playable. I've seen the forums and have attempted to follow their instructions on how to be able to map the controls to an xbox controller, but I've had literally no luck when following their instructions.

												Tomb Raider from 1996 is the very first entry in the Tomb Raider series and one of the very first 3D action adventure games. The game set the foundation of the action adventure genre and many games took advantage of the unique concepts of the game after that. In that time the game was unique and one of its kind which sold over 8 million copies worldwide during the first few months of release for Sony PlayStation and PC.The game introduced revolutionary 3D worlds that the player could examine and impressive and exciting combat mechanics and gameplay as well as some of the best graphics during that time. The cut scenes were from very high level of detail and the character animations of the characters were some of the best ever made back then.  The player could also save the game progress whenever needed which made the experience more enjoyable. The level designs of the game were smart, cunning and full of potential. The originality and creativity that was putted in the game made it a classic. The memorable boss fights and the smart ways of progression through the levels really left a landmark in the video game industry. Now Lara Croft Is one of the most recognizable action heroines in the video game history. I will give Tomb Raider an 8/10.			"

												Review by xTzharkz.I decided to take a jounrey of finishing all Tomb Raiders what are out there before playing the newest one.I grew up loving this game and as I expected, I still loved the experience. Took me only few days to finish this game. In total I spent around 12 hours and I loved every single bit of it. All the flash backs I got were really heart warming.I recommend this game to old school gamers due to its old graphics and control system which might be hard to get used to. People who have played only novaday games will probably not like this one. (due to lacking the detail and as mentioned controls). The game has a story line but it is not 24/7 in your face. Most of the time it is puzzle solving and exploring. Some killing too of course. Only downside is that you might get stuck, keep running around in the same rooms because of having no idea what you must do. There are really no guide lines so have to figure it out on your own. If you like novadays Tomb Raider, I do recommend to try this out and experience the roots of Tomb Raider journey. I can't belive that it is still being developed and comparing the graphics with this one now. It is amazing how much it has changed, of course in the good way.From me it gets the biggest thumbs up.Tomb Raider II, here I come!xTzharkz [Eric]			"

												First of all, yes, this game does desperately need an update for new systems. I didn't finish it for just that reason. That is to say, the game runs alright on modern systems, but uses a downright bad DosBox emulator which crashes whenever the Windows key (or a few others) is pressed, which is especially annoying given the fact that particular key falls squarely in-between two of the most commonly used buttons in the game. One slightly wrong move and you've blown it. Also factor in the 1996-era computer graphics and controls (which are particularly notably bad here, as you not only have the all-too-common directional issues of the era that always make me wonder how we didn't pull our hair out, but also a character that sometimes downright refuses to jump and move in a given direction at the same time), and this game is particularly dated and as such is at times frustrating. These are definitely cons which, depending how you feel about playing classic games from the period, could be a deal-breaker.Yet, I do still recommend it for those who want the original experience of playing one of the best games of the Lara Croft series, and have the patience and ability to do so. Unfortunately, the graphics of the period are particularly hard on the eyes, so if you have vision issues like I do, be prepared for the possibility of extra strain. But, while it is old, it is still very much the game that you might remember, frustrations and all. The game is immersive, the puzzles and encounters engaging, and it simply feels like a genuinely death-defying Lara Croft adventure (though, admittedly, some of the challenge of defying death comes strictly from the poor controls) where one truly is free and forced to jump, climb, shoot (though there is auto-targeting as long as you're facing the right direction, or it'd be downright impossible with these controls), and dangle with the unforgiving precision necessary to survive. If there's one thing games of the era tended to get right compared to today, it is definitely the lack of hand-holding despite the inferior controls. This is a true adventure game.Overall, though highly dated, it is a truly great game, and one that would serve the series very well as a future remaster rather than the modern inferior sequels they keep releasing.

												This game represents my gamer-childhood as a console player. I remeber it all, since the first time my cousin showed it to me for PlayStation 2 and since then, every time I visited them, I always played it. We tried to finish it without a memory card due to lack of money, and we never finished it. It wasn't until 2016 that I found the game in this platform and revived my childhood once again. I spent hours trying to solve the puzzles to pass the levels and to find the secrets. It cost hundreds of saves and valuable time, but at the end I could achieve to complete and finish the game with all pickups and secrets. And when after a lot of years I pushed the start button again, then all changed. The cutscenes, the gameplay, everything I used to try to pass and complete now it was easier. I completed it in 20 hours (although Steam says the half of it :/) aprox. And all I can say is that I still like this game, I haven't played the complete saga though but I'll. I like the enemies, all the guns that you can have, to solve the puzzles in order to complete each level to 100% and discover, travel and observe different Earth-locations, like Egypt, Perú, Greece and also ATLANTIS. I didnt wait for that until I discovered it. I like all of that in this game. The animation in Mida's hand, the ability to break the neck, very realistic too. I highly reccomend this game to every gamer. This was of the first games to be released and what better of the pyramid-shaped-breasts in Lara ¬u¬. What a better game that remembers completely to your childhood. Play it, you'll not be disappointed!!			"

												Tomb Raider is a solid, well designed action-adventure game with gameplay that is just the right amount of precise and just the right amount of varied. Each level feels like an entirely new challenge, both in terms of gameplay and in terms of fiction, it feels awesome. The fact that the game is beautiful, has such a gripping environment and protagonist is simply a fantastic coincidence that adds to it’s quality. I’d recommend this to just about anyone, once you get past the Minecraft-like graphics it feels just as modern as any game today, this game and its first few sequels are indeed timeless classics.

												Probably the first game I ever owned. I only finished it for the first time 7 years ago but play it regularly ever since.Tomb Raider I excels at making the player feel alone against the nature. Unlike it's sequels there are no human enemies here. It's you, wild animals and tombs.Slightly better than Tomb Raider II though with a drab color palette and slightly more rigid controls, Tomb Raider I is well worth your time. This game uses tank controls. As such, it is much better to play using a keyboard. Lara controls very precisly with directional keys.			"

												The first Tomb Raider game is by all means a landmark game of the 90's. Following in the footsteps of games like Metroid and Jill of the Jungle, it features a badass female in the leading role, this time the beautiful adventurer Lara Croft who seeks the Atlentan Scion.It's a pretty gorgeous game for its time with really high quality FMV's, really immersive atmosphere and great level design. It controls similar to older action/adventure games like Prince of Persia or Blackthorne, only in 3D, in that movement is more grid-based than in some other platformers of the time. Highly recommended though I would grade the sequel much higher.			"

												Tomb Raider 1.... The game that stole 20+ hours of my life that I can never get back. An adventurous adventure that goes as deep as the earth allows it to go. If the earth didn't contain any bottom, then this game would have never ended.There's plenty of locations. Everything from the snowy mountains, to the lava-covered sanctuaries. Fight an arsenal of enemies! Wolfs, bears, dinosaurs, gorillas, other adventurers and even taliban aliens!Step aside Indiana Jones, Lara is even thirstier for treasure than ever before. Do you need a pickaxe, drill, jackhammer? Forgot I even asked.... Lara even beats the sh*t out of everything using her very own pair of razor sharp ♥♥♥♥♥♥s! Just by looking at them would probably turn you into steel, but fear not... they're even harder!Before playing this game, I thought it was gonna be easy, but it's absolutely not easy! It's about as easy as drinking a glass of water upside down, while watching a game were your favorite team loses! I've played games that contains puzzles before, but not a game that makes The Legend of Zelda look like Tic-tac-toe!You know what? I'm so done with Tomb Raider 1! Now.... Time for Tomb Raider 2.

												Original TRis still better than Rise of Tomb Raider and  2013 in about everything, except for graphics and controls. Classic tomb raider more immersive, chellenging & realistic than new games.  Lets compare:  Tomb Raider 1996  TR 2013 + Rise of    Minimalistic UI with only healthbar visible when you hurt and very immersive expirience  Hell lot of UI elements that clutters screen, cant be turned off and breaks immersion    You can fall of cliffs and die, but you still can manually grab ledge when you fall to save yourself, yet you can fall and die if you will stop holding grab button, you are in control of climbing. Every edge you see is grabable and generic rules apply everywhere. Also jumping and grabing requires precision, good aiming and timing of sequence of action (run, or walk slowly, push jump at right place and time, than push grab button at right time and place), one wrong small step or miscalculation of your actions and you are dead. You feel like engineer who tries to calculatte trajectroy or a parkour master who tries jump from one roof to another - it was challenging fun and this actually what tomb raider is about.  You can bump into invisible wall in front of every cliff and will never fall and die if you walk, in 90% of times Lara will just stand, in 10% of time Lara will fall but will autograb edge. Game controls climbing for you, you only need to press direction and sometime press X to prevent QTE fall and death. You can only grab obviously highlighted edges, while rest just ungrabable even it look like one you can grab. Game breaks its own rules like every second! In one second there is invisible wall that prevents you from falling, in another second you expect the same from same object, but this time there is no wall and you fall. Same happens with distance of jumping - sometimes it looks like you could not make it but you can, sometimes its opposite. You never sure about rules of climbing and jumping, Absolutely no need for precision, game autoaims, and if you was not close to cliff you can see forced animation of Lara getting magneted to nearest cliff when she obviously was falling. You feel like re-tarded kid with IQ bellow 0, who only helds gamepad, while adutls nearby actually playing game instead of you and clapping hands when pretending that you did it. You just press forward and press A and game does aiming, grabbing and calculation of trajectory for you. Absolutely no challenge and fun, and core of what made Tomb Raider series that good is ruined.   Immersive tutorial in Lara's home, where she pronounce control tips, nothing shows on screen and no tips appears when you are in rest of levels. No super-man x-ray vision. You need to use your observation skills. Game respects your intelligence. Tutrorial is Immersion-breaking  huge UI that clutters half screeen, pauses game and tells you what to do non stop almost until the very end of game. In 2013 there was x-ray vison forced a lot of times, In Rise of you can turn it off, but tutorial will still annoy you wth tips about it and in some cases game will force slowmo and x-ray vision, no mater what. Game insults your intelligence and treats you like re-tard.   Realistic animations of weapon holstering and unholstering - lara had 2 types of weapons on her body,  while you chose active one in (still more immersive and realistic) menu, you can always see both weapons on her body and how she holster one and then uholster another when you change them. Aiming and hell lot of other animations are procedural and while tech is old and framerate of animation not so smooth, transition between animations was realistic and never skiped in-between phasel   Unrealistic weapon spawns right of lara♥♥♥♥♥- you got pistol in you arm? Bow will magically vanish from Lara's back. You want to use bow? Ok game will make pistol vanish and will spawn bow on her back. Most on animations pre-baked, while they are technicaly smooth, transition between them is chopy and missing in-between phases. Damn it, game of 2013-2015 cant do all types of weapon on body and holster while game of 1996 can! What a shame!   Huge non linear maze-level that looks like real tomb, where 90% of gameplay is exploration, climbing, solving environmental puzzles, backtracking here and there, and only about 10% is shooting, but shooting with strafe- jumping and acrobatics and most of what you shoot was wild animals.  And you can see cutscenes only in begining and end of levesl, and rarely in a middle, so basically 99% of gameplay time you actually playing the game and gameplay value is so high you dont even need much of the story to enjoy it.  Tiny linear levels with optional 5-10 minutes long tombs, with no actual backtracking possible in most of them (but you can magically teleport between camps). There are fight arenas between linear exploration sequence. And while at very begining of game you feel like you exploring something in the end you realise that shooter arenas took like 90% of gameplay time. And shooting here does not include any jumping and acrobatics, its generic cover shooter. To be fair in Rise of they improved a little bit, still linear design but shooting and exploring hubs are like 50\50 now, and they improved stealth system a little so now you can stealth kill everyone in arena instead of shooting. But still you do way too much of killing people and way too little of exploring tombs. Also game is really bad about cut-scenes, about 50% of every level is disguised cut-scene where you need to press X or follow linear path and do nothing else. Too much of cutscenes or pseudo-gameplay sequences like ""everything falls or explodes, lara runs, falls, screams, gets deadly injuries but survivise, feel hurt like 1 minute, than forgets about injury and repeats same pattern"". You feel like half of time you watching over-the top Crystal Scull clone, instead of playing Indi inspired game original TR was. While movies are about 2 hours long, this Nuked Fridge rollercoster of repetivness gets old really fast and bores you during 10-25 hours its takes to finish the ""game"". Too much of generic clicheed story instead of gameplay with low value does make it enjoyable.    I remember every memorable music track from original TR  Wait, what, there was music in TR 2013 and Rise of ? I cant remember any!    Lara talks only when its really necessary, and she has nice british accent. Women that talks when they have rational reason and talks only about subject - are pure gold.   Lara talks non-stop to herself, sobs and screems for no reason after every action. She cant do a step without screaming ""AAAA"" or sobing. Women that talks non-stop without logical reason - just annoying.    Story is simple, but nice and solid, no logs scattered around wolrd, no dissonance between gameplay and cutscenes. It does not annoy you, yet its present in amount enough to keep you enterntained and tell you important things about Lara, goals, and evil guys.  Story is a worse than ""Crystall Scull"" kind of stupid Rhianna Pratchett's mess. Convoluted, contradics itself, lacking any logic and consistency, it breaks gameplay sequences for no good reason, and worst thing - most of story told via logs irrationally scattered around world as collectibles. This is worst type of narrative design that ever existed in game. If you cant tell whole story in cut-scenes and gameplay sequences in their context, then quit this job!  Cant write more, out of space :-(			"

												I haven't played Tomb Raider since I was significantly less fat, (and I'll tell ya that was quite a while ago) but the series was on sale, so I bought them. It was quite an ordeal to get this dinosaur working on Windows 10, but I did it, and was pleasantly surprised with what I found. Tomb Raider is a fun, complex, old-school platformer with a side helping of shooting lions and gorillas in the face. Despite the extremely dated graphics and lack of music (this being the DOS version) it has a great, spooky atmosphere and a surprisingly large variety despite the whole game taking place in dusty tombs. The controls are kind of wonkey, but once you get used to them you'll find a difficult, yet rewarding experience that will curb anyones hunger for some good-ole jump timing.			"

This game has 15 levels, all with unique challenges and obstacles to overcome. I've beaten this game, and it was amazing! The clever level design and puzzle solutions is amazing. I did have to look up 1 thing, and that was pressing CTRL on Mida's hand to turn the lead bars into gold (You'll know on level 6 or 7) All in all, this game is an amazing adventure game that offers anywhere between 20-30 hours of gameplay, maybe more if you start a new game after beating it and use the infinite ammo it gives you.

												The game that startet the Tomb Raider series. Its one of my favorite games of all time, why? Because its one of the first games I ever played. For being such an old game the graphics is okay, when I was young the game needed an pretty high tec computer to run. Now the controlls feels not that good, but with my Xbox 360 controller the controlls in the game is much better. If you want to understand Tomb Raider, why it is the way it is, you should buy it. But, be prepared for some hard platforming and confusing camera angels. SInce it is a classic I will give it 10/10 just because Lara Croft is in my mind ""the Queen of Adventure"".			"

												The original classic from 1996 is back! Tomb Raider is a game that needs no introduction. Starring one of the first mainstream female characters in video gaming history, and featuring gameplay designed around a Indiana-Jones style of adventuring. This is the original classic of one of my most cherished franchises in gaming history.Every level is cleverly designed to make you explore and the emphasis is on puzzles more then combat. The atmosphere in this game is perhaps it's most unique feature. There isn't much music, but a lot of ambient background noise that will keep you unsettled as you explore the tombs of ancient civilizations.One disappointment with this PC release is that much of the music from the Playstation release has been removed, which is a bit of a let down. This game is also hit or miss how well it will perform on modern PC's. The game is emulated using Dosbox and it may not always run correctly on modern graphics cards/sound cards without graphical glitches or sound glitches.If you can look past it's dated graphics, old-school grid-based controls, and it's clunky (but creative) puzzle logic then Tomb Raider is a classic game that I highly recommend to any fan of Action/Adventure games.

												Amazing Game! Its like a platforming chess match with guns! Super interesting game and the first start to the series. Steam encases the game in DOSBox Emulator and it works very well. Only issue i had with the DOSBox is that it crashes everytime you try to minimize it. Which is whatever. Besides that the game is super fun and some of the funny glitches that existed in the PSX version of the game dont happen on the PC version! Remember how sometimes the Secrets never properly chimed? Well they do now! This is just the regular vanilla version of the game and Doesnt include certain updates nor the ability to install the Unfinished Business Expansion that Eidos gave away for free. To play those your going to have to Dig through the Community Guides. Besides that super fun game and very playable through Steam on Windows 8/8.1!			"

												The first videogame I played as a child. So many good memories. A combination of mechanic, but great puzzles with great action battles against creatures and traps of all sorts.Of course it's old (released in 1996), but it has what used to make those cheesy old games great:- Good gameplay (except if you're only use to play PC games with mouse and not only keyboard)- A charismatic character- Awesome music (although there is no music besides cutscenes and the main menu, there's a fix that can let you play with music activated, look through steam walkthroughs)- Unforgettable and classic momentsThis game was the start of a legend...

												Tomb Raider is a franchise that influenced my adolescent years, and Tomb Raider 1 specifically is the very first fully 3D game I've ever played in my life. As such, it will always hold a special place in my heart. If you never played any of the classic 90's Tomb Raiders, you may be inclined to dismiss this game as a trainwreck with horrible controls and even worse graphics, but please - DO give this game a chance!First of all, do not even attempt to play the game as is. Download nGlide and adjust the settings. There's a helpful guide on Steam that describes the whole process ('Visual Improvements' by Xazuki). Tomb Raider is 20 years old and looks the part, but you can make it look a little bit better with nGlide. You may think that it's not worth the effort and you'd rather play the PS1 version, but don't do it. The PS1 graphics are horrendous and cannot be improved in any way. You can also only save at Save Crystals which makes the game rather frustrating. In the PC version you can save anytime, anywhere. The whole nGlide thing doesn't even take 5 minutes and makes the game look infinitely better. Keep in mind that the pre-rendered CGI cutscenes will still be interlaced and look pretty bad. They looked like this back then as well so don't worry about it too much.Tank controls: back in the 90's these controls were absolutely fantastic and for me they hold up even today. I still vividly remember how much I hated it when Tomb Raider Legend switched to more modern mouse+keyboard controls. If you're playing this game for the first time, you may need some time to get used to the controls but please don't give up and give this game a chance. Once you learn the ropes, it's a LOT of fun. The keyboard controls are really, really good and you'll play like a pro in no time. Keep in mind that:- Pressing the left/right arrows will only turn Lara in that direction, NOT make her run like it would in modern games.- There are no camera controls; instead, the camera automatically follows you and when you hit a dead end, it moves in front of you which may initially be rather confusing.- If you press both up and down arrows at once, Lara will do a little roll and turn 180 degrees instantly, saving you time.- You holster/draw your guns by pressing space bar. Once your guns are out, Lara will automatically target any enemy nearby. All you have to do then is to press and hold Ctrl until the enemy is dead. Release Ctrl and press and hold it again to target a new enemy or else Lara will keep shooting the dead corpse. The combat is simplistic and usually involves running/rolling around or jumping back away from an enemy and shooting until they're dead.- Until you memorize the level layout, it's useful to run around with your guns out. Lara often targets enemies before you can even see them which is useful. However, you cannot do anything other than shoot while your weapons are out. You need to holster them to do stuff like picking up items/unlocking doors/pulling levers/etc.- The levels are grid based which is very useful when you're trying to figure out if you can make a jump or not! When jumping, Lara can cross 2 squares and will grab onto the edge of the third one. The running jump gets you across 3 squares and you will grab onto the edge of the fourth one. The little back jump (Down Arrow key) is exactly 1 square long. You need exactly 1 square to do a running jump.- Pressing and holding down Shift will make Lara walk. While she's walking, she can't fall off a ledge. Walking also allows you to walk through spikes safely. To execute a running jump, walk up to an edge of a platform, let go of Shift, press arrow down to jump back once, then press and hold Alt (jump key) and start running forward.-There's no annoying automatic grabbing of ledges like in moderm games, everything is 100% manual. Press and hold Control just as you're about to reach a ledge you want to hold onto.- Shift + Alt is a secret swan dive move that gives you some extra momentum when swimming.- Jumping may seem a bit unresponsive to you but that's how it's supposed to be. Lara needs to run a bit inbetween jumps, you can't chain-jump like you would in modern games. If you're not sure when she's ready to jump, just hold Alt instead of pressing it.Tomb Raider is quite old and has its quirks, but if you stick with it you'll have loads of fun. The level design is still great even today, as is the music and ambient sound. The atmosphere can be genuinely creepy and oppressive. the voice acting is pretty weak compared to the later entries in the series, but it's not a deal breaker. Bottom line: Tomb Raider is an absolute classic that defined 3rd person action platformers. It's a game everyone should play at least once in their life. Don't let the outdated controls and visuals deter you. This game is still very much worth your time.			"

												Before you play this game it's very important for you to understand that (apart from the ending) it is not an action game or an adventure game but a puzzle game through and through.The first thing that'll become apparent when you start to play is the lack of music. No really, there is no music throughout the entire game other than on the title screen and cutscsenes. Apparently this harkens back to the original PC release back in the 90's which also didn't have music as opposed to the Playstation version. I understand it was hard to do this back then, probably because of the game engine or something, but nowadays this could have been fixed easily. That's my only real complaint really but sadly it's a big one. Because without music things got a bit boring at times, especially in the beginning.But it's still a good game, the puzzles are not particularly difficult but time consuming and the controls are devastatingly dated but I enjoyed it. The ending in particular was very satisfying.			"

												7/10I remember I played one of the tombraiders when i was a child and had a bad experiance with the tank like controls and a bear and I hated the series since then. Irrational I know but still anyway when i got into steam I wishlisted them cause I figured I'd give them a try now and see if my opinion differred. Since it had a nice sale I decided to buy the bundle. Other than crashing the dos emulator a couple times (found a guide on the community hub to fix it) I find I actual found that I quite like the first game. While very dated I must say it is fun, (Once I figured out how to rebind keys, save, and control her) Ofcourse only after the first area did I find the tutorial xD. Anyways definately a good game, story seems a little lacking but gameplay and puzzles and secrets make me wanna go back and find what I missed while continuing playing as well.			"

												The original Tomb Raider is one of my favourite Action/Adventure games ever. It could have something to do with the fact it was the first game i bought for the Playstation though.Graphics Well let's get this out of the way then; The graphics were amazing at that time when it launched on the Playstation, let alone the PC version. But most games that came out in the Playstation era did not age well, this is no exception. The graphics look blocky, just like most Playstation games.Gameplay Tomb Raider's gameplay didn't change much over the years so there's nothing special on that front. Lara shoots & jumps and that's about it. She's not able to crouch in this game yet, but she can switch levers!Characters The protagonist of Tomb Raider is ofcourse Lara Croft, I don't think there's anyone that doesn't know who that is. The other characters in the game are quite interesting too. The voice acting wasn't great but it didn't bother me much.Story I won't say the game's story will blow your mind but it's pretty decent and makes you want to play on.Atmosphere Most of the game takes place in Ancient buildings, Ruins, Tombs and Caves with lots of references to mythical gods. Obviously one of the things that made this game so great.Music/Sound One of the reasons why Tomb Raider is such a memorable game. I know Music or sounds doesn't make a game but it sure can make it stand out from the rest. The sounds themselves are nothing special but the music is something special. Beautiful Ambient tracks and Orchestrial tracks will be played whenever you enter a new location and it instantly sets the mood. Weapons There are only a few weapons in the game but I don't think this game needs a lot of weapons. Enemies Tomb Raider has a big variety of enemies. Most of the time you will be shooting animals, some of them are endangered species or even extinct. Aside from animals you will be battling monsters and a few humans.Conclusion As I already said before; Tomb Raider will always be one my favourite games and I would recommend anyone, who isn't afraid of outdated graphics, to try this game.

												Super game and brings back a lot of childhood memories. Didn't have to think twice about perchesing this game. Only thing I would put it down on is lack of controller support. So used to playing this game with a controller it's a bit strange using a keyboard. Hope there's an update soon that will allow controllers to be used. Other than that classic game that's well worth playing if you never have but are a fan of the newer Lara Croft games.			"

												This is one of the most fond games from my youth on the playstation. The murky black fog (lack of drawdistance) really draws you in as you explore, completely unware of what you'll see moments later. Everything was eerie and the later levels really crank up the nightmare fuel, assuming you're man enough to get that far. This game is balls 2 the wall hard, as you'll soon figure out about the tenth time Lara refuses to latch onto the edge of a platform and plummets to her death. There's tons of little items to find in cleverly hidden alcloves, but getting them all is literally impossible. The very last item will simply vanish from existance if you get every secret before it. Were they planning on giving you a super special secret item if you got everything? I guess we'll never know now will we? The secret is locked in this ancient crypt of a game.			"

You get the true sense of isolation and adventure even to this day!			"

												The first game in a series, that would grow to become one of my most fond childhood memories.Unlike the following Tomb Raider games, this one was takes place strictly in old, and ancient tombs, and temples (even cities). Most of which have been burried underground (actually due to technical limitations) For me this simply adds to the epicness factor, as you explore a huge city or colosseum hidden underground. There is so much that can be said about this game, I have never personally completed it on Playstation 1, but having it on Steam now i hope to do so.Some people do say the controlls are hard to use, i do agree, to a very limited extend. I believe it's simply down to learning them, and accepting them. The controlls are abit stiff, but overall when you get used to them, they are great.Putting down the game because of the controlls not being 'easy' and abit stiff, would be a big shame, as this is a game that must be experience by anyone who loves adventure and exploration games.And now for the question everyone asks; Does the Steam version run on modern systems at all? To which i can happy reply; Yes. The Steam version of this game is FANTASTIC, it runs very well, has working Steam GUI. And if you want to upgrade the visual quality, that can also be done with one or two quick modifications.			"

A bit hard to play with the 360 controller even when using a program like Xpadder. The game is super sensitive to the analog stick, so if your stick is leaning just a tad to the side while running, you will start running like you're drunk. Might have to just play the game with the keyboard. Nonetheless, i'm glad to have this in my library.			"

While the graphics may not be up to par, and the sound effects aren't the best anymore, (the game is almost 20 years old, so cut it some slack there) the ""block"" level system is a classic that is always worth re-visiting. After playing for a bit, you'll forget about the graphics and become wrapped up in the excitement of exploring ancient temples in Peru, Greece, Egypt, and even the lost world of Atlantis. 9/10			"

												Loved this back in 1996 for the Playstation 1.  This was the game that set new benchmarks in many ways but one of those that I was amazed at was the sheer size of the game and the graphics.  Gameplay was great, levels were amazing just to explore, and the music , still the most listened to of any game I ever had, I really think the music helped for the atmosphere that this game creates.Although the graphics have since moved on to staggering heights in games these days, (as expected) the gameplay in Tomb Raider is still fantastic.  This PC version is amazing, the only one negative point here is the controls, using keyboard for controls is just really awful, you should definitley use a controller.Remember it runs using DOS, so check out DOS wiki through google and in here you can find useful commands like recording gameplay and more.10/10 still.

It's the freedom to move around, doing acrobatic moves and shoot creepy mummy monsters, mutants and hungry animals (sorry, animals!!) in the face. Also just the pure exploring of the ancient buildings and the search for items and secrets are a lot of fun.It may not look that pretty nowadays but it still plays that well.			"

												The game itself is great, a good mix of action and puzzles.  Sometimes the game can be quite unforgiving when you get to certain points but the PC advantage here is that you can save the game just about anywhere.  Just make sure to have backup saves so that you can go back when you need to.  I got all the way to the end and needed to go back a couple saves because I ran out of supplies and couldn't finish the last fight.  It is difficult, the jumping mechanics in particular are difficult to master and when moves have to be performed quickly to survive I often had to reload the game many times.  As for this steam version of the game there are a few annoyances (that perhaps I could have fixed by modding, but I didn't bother looking):1) No controller support2) You can customize buttons, but the game forgets to turn to ""User Keys"" each time you start it, so you have to select ""User Keys"" instead of ""Default Keys"" every time.3) Fullscreen on a 16:9 monitor means that you have a black bar on the right side the whole time so that the game preserves it's aspect ratio.4) If you Alt+Tab out of the game you cannot get back into it, you have to close dosbox and restart it.5) Cutscenes look awful, sort of like giant scanlines through everything, ironically those scale to the full 16:9 format but just look bad.However, that said this was an enjoyable experience that was frustrating at times, it's amazing what such a small team managed to do back in 1996.I would recommend this game to those who don't mind the issues associated with how old it is and want to start where it all began.7/10			"

												Picked this game up when the Tomb Raider collection was on sale. Decided since I was new to the Tomb Raider franchise I would start at the very beginning (which came out at the start of my gaming career - when I was only 6 years old). By the time of this review, I have mastered the controls, saved and loaded over 500 times and really started to enjoy the charm this oldie has :). Friends bugged me when puzzles stumped me for hours, but at about 10 hours in it became a matter of principle. I WILL beat this game before moving on to the next. If you are patient, and save often this game is a fantastic classic, new and old Tomb Raider fans should live, or re-live the adventure.			"

												Hard to say anything bad about the original Tomb Raider.. IT'S amaz balls!! Unfortunately the graphics have grow a little long in the tooth. Still worth a play, you wont be disappointed or you will. That is however not my problem. If you are willing to give the old girl a spin check out Glidos! It's an amazing little bit of software for upping the graphics, don't expect miracles though. Don't forget to grab a updated texture pack =) Enjoy!! and Cheers!!!			"

												Tomb Raider is a game I returned to with eyes glazed with nostalgia. I do this every few years with various things I liked as a tween, Linkin Park, being another prime example, before remembering that my 12 year old self wasn't actually that bright.That's not to say Tomb Raider is bad. It's just aged pretty badly, early 90's 3D makes Lara look like she's been carved out of wood and she always tends to be trying to merge with the scenery. Environments aren't much better, in the back of your head, you're always vaguely aware that the whole game seems to be built on a grid, (every block the same size, etc). So aesthetically it's crap, but how does it play?Moderately badly now you mention it. To be fair Lara does control extremely well for running around, making huge leaps, somersaulting and shooting. It's when the game gets into the second act and the fiddly jumps come in that the controls become a problem. If you, like me, played Tomb Raider back before the iPod was invented then you probably remember with fondness the screaming masogynistic curses you would yell at Lara as she dived into a spike pit instead of the desired ledge. It is not actually that fun reliving said experience.My final gripe is actually hard to describe. (some background) I got all the old Tomb Raiders in a steam sale and binged on them over a weekend off, (this is the best of the lot) and I started to get this nagging feeling. The same feeling I got while playing too much Diablo 2: 'it's all the same.' you are doing the same thing over and over. Theres not much game here really, just a series of levers you have to pull in the correct order. That combined with the ugliness and the frustration drove the final nail into the nostalgia coffin.Having said all that, it's still a great game and definately worth £4.99. The reason for this is similar to the reason I like similarly hideous game 'Deus Ex'. Because it's ugly as sh*t the designers could make pretty much whatever they wanted. The game is loooooooong, the variety is fantastic and the different locales are great. the game is packed with highlight set pieces, like the T-rex attack, the colosseum fight, the Sphinx, a statue turning Lara into gold, Atlantis city and a certain (very vertical) level in which you must pass the challenges of the gods. That's the reason I kept coming back to the shoddier sequels. For that sense of adventure I shared with a woman with an extremely impractical set of mammary glands.			"

												Ofcourse graphics are outdated, but it got great animations which accompanied with Laras athleticism makes movement somewhat cool. It runs on DosBox which runs good on windows 10 and i had no problems with it. If you want good pc port of tomb raider then don't pick one up, but if you just want to solve puzzles in tombs and shoot some enemies then as a lara croft then you must get this one.			"

												The first game in a series, that would grow to become one of my most fond childhood memories.Unlike the following Tomb Raider games, this one was takes place strictly in old, and ancient tombs, and temples (even cities). Most of which have been burried underground (actually due to technical limitations) For me this simply adds to the epicness factor, as you explore a huge city or colosseum hidden underground. There is so much that can be said about this game, I have never personally completed it on Playstation 1, but having it on Steam now i hope to do so.Some people do say the controlls are hard to use, i do agree, to a very limited extend. I believe it's simply down to learning them, and accepting them. The controlls are abit stiff, but overall when you get used to them, they are great.Putting down the game because of the controlls not being 'easy' and abit stiff, would be a big shame, as this is a game that must be experience by anyone who loves adventure and exploration games.And now for the question everyone asks; Does the Steam version run on modern systems at all? To which i can happy reply; Yes. The Steam version of this game is FANTASTIC, it runs very well, has working Steam GUI. And if you want to upgrade the visual quality, that can also be done with one or two quick modifications.			"

Controls are weird but I played it on PC so I'm used to them. Sometimes Dosbox crashes but I guess it's the price one has to pay in order to play it in 2015. Recommended... if you like old games.

												The original Tomb Raider is certainly a mixed bag. It's not really a contentious observation to say that the controls are completely awful, as Lara handles about as gracefully as a cow on a forklift, courtesy of her tank controls, but the actual gameplay once you get the hang of it is actually quite fun.One thing I quite liked about this game's story compared to the general perception of Lara Croft these days, is that for all intents and purposes Lara is NOT a hero. Protagonist, sure, but she's depicted here as a callous adrenaline junkie who is roped into the plot strictly through the promise of thrills, and sticks it through to the end basically just to spite the people who tried to kill her.I actually found this characterization fairly interesting, and was glad to see that in truth Lara does in fact have a personality outside of her bust size (which never much mattered to me, personally I think her most attractive physical asset would be her toned abs, which soften out after the third game in favor of a more generic swimsuit physique). Shame it meant so little to the developers and the public consciousness that each reboot of Lara might as well be an entirely different person.The game actually shows quite a bit of restraint throughout, and while you do gun down dozens of endangered animals throughout the adventure, the body count is much, much lower than an equivalent game made today would ever be. Your final human kill count by the end is SIX (or even five depending on how you classify the final boss), and even the animals you kill are largely brief encounters with one or two at a time to keep you on your toes - for the most part the game is content to let you solve the platforming puzzles in peace.The game's biggest flaw, as is a sad recurrance, is its final level. Tomb Raider's interpretation of Atlantis is certainly a new one - gilded Ry'leh isn't something I expected - but let's set some new standards, alright? Developers: you're not allowed to set your final level inside a colon anymore. I know you're trying to go for an offputting atmosphere, but it looked like crap in Halo 3, it looked like crap in Tomb Raider, it looked like crap in Half-Life, and it looked like crap every time it was done in Dead Space. But that's not the issue I have with the final level. The issue is quite simply that it's not very well designed. From the start I picked up on the feeling that the developers were starting to run out of ideas, with nonsensical puzzles that couldn't be passed off as ancient puzzle-based security systems, but it was around the penultimate boss fight and afterwards that cinched the deal: medpacks basically stop being a thing. I managed to get a pretty good distance without needing to heal through skill and perseverance, but in the end I had to give up and watch the ending cutscene on YouTube (since I couldn't get the level skip cheat to work).Being down to essentially my last sliver of health, the game had suddenly turned into I Wanna Be The Guy as every trap would kill me instantly, and certain drops became literally impossible as I couldn't even handle the minute damage from falling that far. I suspect this is a typical side effect of the developers running out of time or money or energy for proper playtesting and rushing the product to shelves. In the end though I had a lot of fun with this, even if I couldn't experience the last 20-odd minutes of gameplay myself.			"

												I played the old PS1 version briefly back in the day and could never really get into it. For whatever reason, even though this game is pretty bad by today's standards, I find myself really enjoying it so far. I'm a couple levels from the end, playing only an hour or two a day, but those hours are filled with some intense gunfights, simple (but not obvious) puzzle solving, and tons of exploration.If you can get in the gaming mindset of the mid-1990s, this game has it all. Just give it a level or two to really click.			"

												I am a Tomb Raider fan and followed since day 1, Tomb Raider 1 is original and although may not look all that great, but for a game that's 19 years old...I give this one lots of credit and like any old game, graphics quality will always show in some way. Look over the quality, and just play. :o)If you're a High Quality imaged person, you might be disappoionted. But, again it's still a game. I recommend the game for it's originality and storyline, not what it looks like. DosBox isn't bad at all and was the standard back then (1996) when certain games were being re-coded for compatibility reasons. So......It's nice to see a 19 year old game still capable of playing on a XP or Vista system. My generation, you learned to deal with that quality..back then...nobody knew the difference. Rest of the TR Series are great games. But, that's my opinion :) hope you can agree. Goodluck! Enjoy.			"

												20 years old... Jeez, has it really been that long?This game is where Tomb Raider started, and it is also my first time playing this game.  It has held up suprisingly well against the age of time.In this game, you play as Lara, with not only her dual pistols to help out, but all of her acrobatic moves to boot.  You'll go through ancient jungle areas, Greece temples, Egypt, and another secret area I won't discuss.  All of Laras acrobatics work nicely in the game world, with the superb level design  making use of all her abilities to their fullest.Graphics and sound have held up pretty well, especially considering this game is 20 years old now. There are two bad strikes against this game; first is that it does feel rather sluggish at times, probably due to all of the modern games out there; second, is that it crashes often (Runs on DOSBox).I would recommend, yes, go play it.  You will need patience, and you will need to save a whole bunch, but for a 20 year old game, I would say that it has aged rather well.			"

												A game that lacks the PS1 music counterpart [runs on DOSBox emulator] Plays solid, bug free, [problem is if you can put up with windowed mode and the dual screen problem] This game is a gem of nostalgia of the past and acrobatic, run and jump challenges. Lacks the Add on: Unfinished Buisiness. If only this game readjusted to be compatible with later OS's much like Sold Out Software once did for Windows 98 titles like: Tomb Raider I, Black and White, Micro Machines V3 etc.I'd give this retro classic a 6/10 for it's Gameplay, Memory and Nostalgia. 9/10 if - The compatability with OS is updated.- Adopting the PS1 or PC soundtrack properly.- No resort to Emulator.- Add on: Unfinished Buisiness included.- No autofix on resolution, set upon user preference.

												This game is old. I mean, it's fu**ing olde. So olde it doesn't even have mouse support. So olde you can use it in yo momma jokes dealing with age. I was ready to sh*t all over it. I had this steaming fudge soup tearing a hole in my assh*le and I was ready to give it a Cleveland Steamer. Don't bother googling that: it's when you s*it on someone's chest.But I gave it a shot anyway, cause I live life on the edge; also it came with the reboot. I looked up some other reviews and it was typical ''oh man this is the best in the series'' and ''CLASSIC''. Bull. It's always the same ''best game evar'' crap.But it's actually not....a bad...game? Don't get me wrong, it's still olde, but so far I've played through the first level (four in total) and am actually impressed. The shooting is terrible and you can't aim, but if you can excuse the bad aspects you still have a pretty competent title. There are secrets hidden throughout the levels, and the levels are actually pretty big for their time. There's a fair amount of exploration and if you can put aside the sometimes crappy camera, you get a pretty good 3D platformer. The base level design is pretty good, and if it weren't for the outdated mechanics and Laura handling like an RE character (pre 4), this would still be a great title capable of still holding its own.Don't get me wrong, I'm not strongly recommending this. Or even casually telling you to get it. The boss battles have the ''Mirrors Edge'' syndrome; completely unecessasry and the game lacks the mechanics to actually make them worthwhile. It would benefit from taking all combat away. But the game, if you can overlook outdated...everything, still has a worthwhile ''base'' composed of platforming, exploration, and level design that is still impressively pertinent. It's no Mario 64 (that game, graphics aside, is not outdated at all), and I'm not really enthusiastic about recommending it. But the bottom line is this: I don't hate the damn thing so I'm gonna give it a thumbs up if only because I'm pretty impressed at how I'm actually not disliking it so far. In fact, it's...kinda entertaining, so far.			"

												Всегда мечтал познакомиться с Ларой, и вот, наконец, наше знакомство состоялось.  Какая она? Ну, как она сама вспоминает, поначалу она была немного угловатой. Её несильно интересовали люди, а всё больше различные пещеры, пирамиды и их тайны. В своих первых экспедициях, по её воспоминаниям, всё было очень непросто. Она могла десятки раз пытаться запрыгнуть на далекостояшую платформу, когда же прыжок бьл неимоверно опасен, она мысленно совершала его иногда сотни раз, пока не появлялась уверенность в том, что всё получится.  Непросто было и ходить, и бегать, и перепрыгивать с места на место, У неё всё время создавалось впечатление, что она не управляет сопственным телом. Оно казалось ужасно тяжёлым и неуклюжим, но постепенно она как будто к этому привыкла. Её перестала раздражать собственная неповоротливость, она даже научилась её использовать. Было чертовски сложно, чертовски. Но это ни с чем не сравнить. Она чувствовала себя взрослой. Никто не говорил ей, что делать, куда идти, никто не подсказывал решение головоломки. Пока не знаю, какие истории меня ждут дальше, но мне бесконечно полюбилась эта первая. Дерзните, познакомьтесь с Ларой. И распросите про её первое путешествие, если только вас не пугает какая-то квадратность, однообразность и некрасивость всего			"

												I would recommend this game for those who enjoy Older games, Action and Adventure, or who enjoy more newer like Tomb Raider games or Tomb Raider I itself. I have always enjoyed the Tomb Raider game series. Especially the main character Lara Croft who looks better in the later games than in these older games. But the game is still fun!Story: A man named Larson tells Lara that Jacqueline Natla, owner of Natla Technologies wishes to speak to Lara about an expedition for her to take, to find an ancient artifact known as the Scion, Lara sets out after being persuaded by money. As she collects each piece, she finds out more and more about Natla Technologies evil intentions to open up a place known as Atlantis. Lara, being one step behind them most of the way and having quite a journey when trying to retrieve each artifact eventually ends up following Mrs. Natla and her crew to Atlantis and unlocks its secrets.

												If you have no nostalgia with the Tomb Raider series this game is NOT for you. The graphics have aged badly, BUT THE CONTROLS, oh god no. This game makes no adjustment for you. You need to learn it's qirks in order to have fun. It's amazing to me how much simply running up stairs can kill the enjoyment as you struggle to get Laura on them from anything but straight on. The finnicky rules for how jumping and grabbing works makes bears and T-Rexes less a threat than the game's mechanics themselves, and fighting the game's mechanics is where I draw the line.It's a history game. Treat it as a history project and you might be able to enjoy yourself. Otherwise, I just don't think you'll have fun.			"

												I absolutely love this game! The puzzles are a little difficult sometimes (I may have cheated by watching walkthroughs once or twice XD) but the difficulty is also a thing that makes the game great. Also, the balance between action and exploring is just enough. I recommend this to anyone especially if you love classic games! :P			"

												I never really played the Tomb Raider games, apart from the HD trilogy that was released on PS3 and Tomb Raider III on the PS1 i haven't been introduced to the series.After playing a bit of this game, i do like it however the controls are horrible. if you're going to play Tomb Raider best do it on a console, even custom mapping the controls. it's still horrible, i couldn't map any keys to my mouse.For this reason i'll prefer Tomb Raider: Anniversary to this (which is a HD remake of this game).

												I would recommend this game for those who enjoy Older games, Action and Adventure, or who enjoy more newer like Tomb Raider games or Tomb Raider I itself. I have always enjoyed the Tomb Raider game series. Especially the main character Lara Croft who looks better in the later games than in these older games. But the game is still fun!Story: A man named Larson tells Lara that Jacqueline Natla, owner of Natla Technologies wishes to speak to Lara about an expedition for her to take, to find an ancient artifact known as the Scion, Lara sets out after being persuaded by money. As she collects each piece, she finds out more and more about Natla Technologies evil intentions to open up a place known as Atlantis. Lara, being one step behind them most of the way and having quite a journey when trying to retrieve each artifact eventually ends up following Mrs. Natla and her crew to Atlantis and unlocks its secrets.

												If you have no nostalgia with the Tomb Raider series this game is NOT for you. The graphics have aged badly, BUT THE CONTROLS, oh god no. This game makes no adjustment for you. You need to learn it's qirks in order to have fun. It's amazing to me how much simply running up stairs can kill the enjoyment as you struggle to get Laura on them from anything but straight on. The finnicky rules for how jumping and grabbing works makes bears and T-Rexes less a threat than the game's mechanics themselves, and fighting the game's mechanics is where I draw the line.It's a history game. Treat it as a history project and you might be able to enjoy yourself. Otherwise, I just don't think you'll have fun.			"

												Tomb Raider was the very first game I purchased on the auld PS1 at the tender age of 6, and those triangular, voluptuous, polygonal funbags were forever etched in my mind; even though, at that time, the game was too ♥♥♥♥in' spooky. The main occurance to cement in my mind that this game, along with the whole series, is made of pure gold, is waking up in the middle of the night to find your dad who has probably only played pong and the Commodore 64, shooting gorillas in the face. My favourite series, 10/10. Disregarding this game being buggy as ur mum's hairy jungle-crack, is a must beg your friends to buy.			"

												Tomb Raider is an action platformer made and released by Core Design in the year 1996. This game was originally released for the Playstation 1, and Sega Saturn. It was also released for PC through the usage of DOSBox. For those who are wanting to get into the Lara Croft : Tomb Raider series, this game is somewhat hard to recommend, despite being the first of the franchise.Please not that I have played and beaten both, the PS1 and PC edition. This review, however, is based upon my experience with the Steam version of Lara Croft : Tomb Raider 1StoryThe story is decent. The cutscenes just tell you enough to get you started, then leaves the rest to your imagination. It reveals itself the further  it goes in, followed by a lame plot twist at the end which left me dumb founded. Overall, its not bad.7.5GraphicsFor an old school game, it looks alright. The game was made back when polygonal 3D graphics started going big, so there was much work to be done before they could perfect making any round objects. Back in it's time, it was no doubt some of the top of the line graphics. Compared to today's technology in graphical development, it's hard to get into this type of game unless you're a fan of the classics. If you are are into the ""shiny"" and new games, then look away, this game is not for you.7.0SoundI'm usually very picky when it comes to in- game music, sound effects, etc... but TR had nothing I could really complain about. The music and effects seemed pretty immersive, which left little to be desired in this specific type of game. The battle music is intense and frightening, giving the game more of the survival feel in intense situations. Also, the music for the theme, finding secrets, and walking into a mysterious place has always suited the moment well. As for the effects, they are alright for an old school DOS game. Every creature, environment, and protagonist has the appropriate sounds for the given situations, which yet again increases immersion. The only aspect I disliked was that of the main protagonist, Lara. Every time she climbs a ledge, runs into a wall, jumps... it sounds far  too artificial... like she's having an... errr.... nevermind. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)7.5GameplayThe gameplay is my favorite part about this game. The puzzles are somewhat challenging, and the parkour is fun and feels dangerous. The gun fights feel stiff due to the controls, but is still enjoyable. And the thing that makes this so great is the dangerous traps that lurk in each tomb. Avoiding and trying to expect what trap is next is what TR is all about. Feeling that you know something is wrong down the hallway, there probably is. There could be a boulder coming from both directions, or some poison darts coming from the walls, or maybe even a dinosaur will break through the ceiling? That's what makes these kind of games so fun. You don't really know what to expect (At least on your first playthrough). Most of the traps are somewhat unpredictable, so this definitely deserves some big pointers. 8.5ControlsThe controls are a tad bit funky. Why? Because I said so (Kidding). For reals, the controls aren't as bad as what people think. The controls are very stiff, so manueverability is somewhat an issue.  I personally used my number pad to link my actions to, then used my wasd as movement. It too some getting used to, but in the end you'll manage.However....If you are more of a console enthusiast, or just cant stand using the keyboard for this game... then check out this controller support guide by Darth Sidious ~http://store.steampowered.comSince this is an old school game I'll give it some slack on the controls. 7.0CinematicsThe cimematics for Tomb Raider were great in terms of quality. That is, I wish I could say that for the PC version. Compared to the Playstation version, the cutscenes are astrocious. Even with all the DosBox tweaking guides I dug up, nothing would seem to fix it. However, this game is not plagued with too many cinematics, so this can be forgiven easily.4.5ReplayabilityThis game has very little replayability to it. After my first playthrough, I never really felt the need to collect all the secrets collectibles since they never did anything special. For those of you who played it before purchasing the game on steam would most likely replay it due to nostalgic reasons. But besides that, I wouldn't really see much of a point.4.5==============================================================================Overall Score7.0A good game for you classic gamers who enjoy platformers and puzzles. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ==============================================================================			"

												Tomb Raider 1 aka Big Game Hunter: Spooky Aztec Tomb edition has almost reached it's twentieth birthday. The big question you should be asking yourself is: has it aged well? To put it shortly, no.To put it longly however, the game is a DOS port of a console port. Two strikes which hinder the game's modern playability. Straight out of the box, you're launched into a 4:3 640x480 resolution cube with which you can gander upon the stuttering walls, warping models, & render distance fog. Control wise, Lara chugs across the landscape like a tracked vehicle that can jump & grip ledges. The camera is glued to a pole on the back of your head, so hazards hiding around corners is nigh impossible. Gameplay wise, you'll only encounter two enemies: timed stage hazards & animals. As you mercilessly gun down the local fauna & trudge through the platforms, the only sound you'll have to accompany you is the diagetic falling of rocks. Whenever music does appear, it's entirely scripted to appear. For the most part, the game is clunky & boring when compared to modern titles that have come about because of this game.If you're looking to the reviews to ascertain wether you want to buy this or not, I cannot recommend it. Anyone who actually wants to buy this game would've done so already. Don't get me wrong, the game still has its perks. If you're an enthusiast who likes playing old games, or just someone who wants to relive the days when you only had a handful of games to play so you explored every nook and cranny in every game, definitely go for it. Otherwise, the game isn't really for you.			"

No controller support, keyboard mappings from hell. AND THERE'S A 3RD PARTY EULA.I like old games. I like retro games. I like platformers. But seriously, this horse crap is unacceptable. Want to buy some old retro games? Throw some money at Sega; their dreamcast ports are pretty good. Fwiw TR:Anniversary (not this game) runs great! But maybe avoid that game too bc this company releases some bad ports that are very insulting. Or maybe you like DIY fixing the damn game yourself kind of thing.			"

												First I was worried whether the game will work on Vista, it turned out to work, so I'm happy about that because Steam often puts games that do not work on some OS. The only problem is the resolution of the game as it is very old, but for that I found the problem on YT - Tomb Raider 1 fullscreen and resolution fix for steam and GOG versions by Daniel Foreman

Also, holding ctrl, alt and an arrow to  jump, grab and move results in my screen turning 90 degrees. So I guess I'm glad I only wasted 99p and not £4.99 trying it.

												I paid for a crappy emulator. I can't get it to work with my controller, and the keyboard functions suck. I can't even put the arrow keys as movements. I loved this game on the play station and wanted it for the computer. I made a bad choice trying to own this. :/			"

												Like many reviews here, I have to complain about the controls.  I've given up on this game because I can't make a specific jump, and I don't wish to spend an hour trying to figure out the exact timing with which I need to press the keys.Also, I got stuck for ~20 minutes because there was absolutely no indication whatsoever that I could push and pull a block.  I had even attempted to grab it, but nothing happened (Lara only actually does something once you've hit the ""grab"" button and then pushed or pulled).  I had to consult a video walkthrough. :(			"

												The original Tomb Raider may have been a great game when it came out, but today it hasn't aged well for one simple reason: the controls. Boy, they suck. Jumping and walking to the sides doesn't always work when you want to and she falls more often than not even if you're careful. When you get used to them they aren't that bad, but they're still sluggish and outdated. The rest of the game is okay, and no, this isn't really a game that focuses on puzzles but rather on exploration, and that is frustrating at times. Puzzles there's only a few, but they're cool. And since the game was released for MS-DOS and not PC, the Steam version uses an emulator, but that's fine. There's no controller support, but you can fix it (check the Steam guides). But i can only recommend this game on sale and if you're really interested in checking the roots of Tomb Raider. Otherwise, play the excellent remake Tomb Raider: Anniversary.			"

												A timeless classic with a terrible PC port esp. for controllers. Apparently since this is an older game it uses something called DOSBox and if you want to configure a controller you will be fighting a losing battle. If you are okay with playing with the keyboard then  this game is for you. With controllers you may get about half of it configured and then it won't save your configuration. There might be a way to fix it but I haven't really found anything except that others are experiencing the same problem. The game will randomly freeze sometimes and will freeze if you try mapping the controller by hitting F1. The game is a great game and I am disappointed that I can't enjoy it. I mean I didn't expect a game that I paid for to be freezing up especially with settings being normal and full internet connection. It would be really nice for an update by either Dosbox or Steam to fix the problem.  So I'm really nuetral about the game, because if you don't mess with the controller and work off the keyboard then it tends to run okay, but if you try to configure the controller then its downhill from there.

												Buy at your own risk. Absolutely nothing has been done to update this game. It uses the ancient tank controls that it had back when it first came out in 1996. I wouldn't expect a graphical overhaul, but I also didn't expect to use spacebar to pull out my guns and press alt to jump. Also, no controller support, unless you plan on playing the whole game using just one joystick, because no other controller functions work. After all this, you'll be thinking, ""Man, I really like this game, but I think it's time for me to turn it off."" Well buckle up, buddy boy, because when you hit that Exit Game button, Windows will stop working entirely. Control, Alt, Delete won't save you, that sucker is frozen. Find the old PlayStation version, don't buy this. It's a great game, just not on PC.			"

												Game runs fantastic. Has to run a dos emulator in the background. Does not work with controllers. You need to use an emulator while running the game to utilize any gamepad support. Music seems to be the original, however they do not have the extra sounds to add suspense: encountering a random enemy, finding secrets, etc. I give the game 3/5 simply for that factor. I'd sooner suggest emulate the game.			"

But by playing it again recently I've found how the controls don't hold up well, the levels look plain and boring, the gameplay is lackluster. There's nothing going for the game but nostalgia alone. This title may very well have a place in my heart but it will not have a place in my hard disk.			"

												Still one the best games ever made.If you can overlook the graphics you will agree! Matter-a-factly: graphics for games should of never mattered -- ever. Gameplay, challange, replayability, timeless. That's this game.If you disagree that only means you're Dennis has some sexy hair.			"

												A lot more fun than I was expecting it to be, considering the graphics are dreadful after all these years. The gameplay although basic kept me engaged until the end. Not an easy game and quite long but I only got frustrated once about failing a few too many times on a few tricky timing jumps.Also worth noting, the expansion pack Unfinished Business isn't included in the Steam version.Lastly, even if the game can be played at 1080p, it doesn't support widescreen resolution.

												TR:I, when you put it in the context of 1996 gaming, is okay. But if you only care about modern games [nothing to be ashamed of], you likely won't enjoy this game. I will do my best to review this game from the former point of view.Putting aside the ridiculously ""top-heavy"" player model for Lara Croft, the game's graphics are okay. A bit polygonal, but not bad overall. I had some issues with DOSbox misplacing renders of non-world objects [e.g. health packs being visible behind walls], but nothing to make it unplayable.The design of the levels is ok as well, but many of the jumping puzzles can end up being rather frustrating. This is because often the required key sequence will not always do what you intended [Trying to run and jump might cause a leap from a standing start, and vice versa]. However, the levels as a whole are generally rather extensive for the era, and there is usually a lot to explore.The game controls primarily with keyboard only, but it can be configured to use a gamepad. I would very seriously recommend not using a gamepad, as it felt very sluggish and unresponsive.The gameplay surrounding gunfights can be ridiculous at times, with both enemies and yourself soaking up bullets like sponges concrete. The game does auto-aim, and doesn't require reloading, so you can run around the map shooting everything with no difficulty whatsoever. Beware bats though, if one gets on top of you and you get stuck in a corner, you're done for.To summarize, this game has flaws. It isn't completely terrible, so if you want to play this game for nostalgic purposes then go ahead, but otherwise don't bother.			"

												As a classic, it's a great game.  My mother and father used to play this game and they loved it.  For the Playstation, I bet it was very fun to play.  However, in today's day and age, it aged horribly.  I give it credit because it was so old, but it is very difficult to control, the same textures being everywhere make it exceedingly difficult, and the learning curve is extremely steap.  I also have not quite figured out if there is a save function, so that will be exciting when I find it.In summary, it is a classic, great for nostalgia, but just get it on the Playstation.  Don't have a playstation? they're cheap and last long.			"

												LacklusterFirst of all, it uses DosBox to emulate the game. That would not be bad if it worked. So get ready to do some fixing before you can start playingThe movement is weird and it takes some time to get used to the controls. The platforming is not as difficult as it seems after you learn how to move Lara. Shooting, on the other hand, is truly terrible for the whole gameI think the graphics are fine. If you follow the guides on the forums, you can play this in a decent resolution, and the block-made characters bring some nostalgia - it's like playing Doom/Shadow Warrior/Duke Nukem, the old graphics are charmingSo why am I giving this a negative review? Because of the level design. Don't get me wrong, I wonder when was the last time I played a game with stages this big and full of secrets. But character movement is slow, there's an insane amount of annoying platforming that requires pinpoint precision, and some levels have this bad design where you can mess up and have to backtrack to undo somethingPlease don't take this negative review as a ""avoid this game completely"". If you bought the Tomb Raider Collection (which you should), give this old gem a shot. It will get boring after some stages (the later ones especially) though, so don't stress yourself to finish this game ASAP			"

												I have played this game before on the original Playstation. To my knowledge it is a very very cool adventure game. My only regret is that either the game is too old to be compatible with the newer OS's or software, or that someone along the line made a mistake in fixing the compatibility issue. Until such is fixed, I do not recommend spending money for this on Steam.To Steam directly: I wish to play this game again, but DOSBox does not wish to cooperate with me and the display linkup fails. Otherwise, I can tell it works fine; it acts as though it does not see the display or there is another communication issue. (I have read through the forums and tried some of the tips from other users and all have failed. Updated versions of DOSBox make no difference.)			"

												I tried going back and playing the older tomb raiders and starting at Tomb Raider I, but that experience ended very fast. This Tomb Raider, although a classic, provides no reason at all for you to play on PC. The game is really old and everything is dated. I only played for a little bit and I couldn't stand playing it on PC. Everything is poorly optimized IMO, but that is to be expected. I would only recommend this for people to play if they feel nostalgia playing this. Otherwise, give the newer games a go.Rating: 5.2/10Recommend: Only in a bundle with the newer games, never by itself			"

												REALLY? Are these supposed to be the SUPERIOR Tomb Raider games? The ones with the best gameplay? The ones that requires you to use your skills? The ones that are CLEARY better than the so called s****y too much gun-based and piece of cake easy as f**k reboot?God, childhood memories makes people go crazy...Fine, this game is still a milestone. It literally invented the action-adventure genre. Without this, we wouldn't have a lot of the games i love today. I get it. I won't argue with any of this.BUT!This game is praised for his platform sections and puzzle solving, and all I wonder is why? WHY?The platform is stupid: the path is clear, you will allways know what you can and you can't reach, which is good! What makes it stupid, and hard as f***k are the awful controls, that will make you fall, over and over again, just when you're trying to get in the good position to jump. And that automatic camera? Who tought that was a good idea? F**K THAT CAMERA!The PUZZLES are even MORE STUPID! These are not puzzles! A puzzle should make you use your brain! You don't even need to think here! It's all about either FINDING A KEY, A LEVER OR SOME BULLS**T ARTIFACT! Then you open the door and that's it. Don't expect it to be easy tho, 'cause they worked hard to hide them in the most unthinkable places, just to make the game look longer. What a bunch of D***S!Is it really satisfying to solve these kind of puzzles? I don't get it.Look, you might have loved this game or his sequels tons of years ago, then do yourself a favor and stay away from it. Don't play it. Don't ruin your memories.And if you're new to this saga and want to give it a go... Don't do it. Don't waste your time.And for f***s sake stop whining about the reboot.How is this game any better anyway? The controls suck, the gunplay sucks, the platform sections suck, the puzzles suck, the story sucks...This game is like Dark Souls: you get f****d over and over again, but here there is no payoff in winning, and it's not required any particular skill.

												BEFORE YOU READI DID PLAY ON PS1 AND THIS WAS FAR BETTER, IT JUST DOES NOT FEEL LIKE A GOOD PC GAME SO MY REVIEW STANDS AS IT IS THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.*sigh*....     I came into TOMB RAIDER with pretty high expectations after hearing about what a great game it was... and dear Lord was I mistaken.     Never, and I mean NEVER, have I played a game that felt so unpolished, so.. incomplete... even Sniper Elite V2 was better than THIS, and I hate Sniper Elite V2.     Taking into mind that this is an old game, I  must say it was most likely a genre changing, ground-breaker of a game when it arrived on shelves, but it did not age well. The controls feel more like something out of an old arcade machine, and not the good ones. I mean one of those untouched, unheard of fighting games with about ten buttons for punching and kicking each, and some of the worst receptivity you'll ever play with. I was literally saving every platform I jump I made, and that is preettty bad when most of this game's puzzles involve platforming. You have to hit and hold three buttons at a time to jump and latch onto a platform, and if you do not hit those buttons at exactly the same time, then you either jump incorrectly or don't latch on, and this... oh this is bad. This should be fixed, she should automatically latch on when you jump, or atleast jump in the direction you move. Surely they had the technology to do this at that point in time, right?  Then even worse is her BASIC movement. Yes, Lara's basic steps and turns are so bad it makes some of the game almost unplayable. When she steps forward she moves about 3-5 feet, and when she moves back she does this annoying hop that goes about 5 feet back. This becomes even more nerve-racking when you take into consideration that ANY type of movement left or righ can result in a rol, cartwheel, or side-jump that messes you up 80 percent of the time. This breaks most of the game (at least for me), and makes it darn near almost unplayable.     Then there is the fighting/shooting and obtaining/activating items. This is not as bad as platforming, but pretty close in it's own rite. To pick up on item, you have to face it, stand directly in front of it and press ""use"". This sounds easy, until you take into mind she moves about 5 feet every step she makes, making this beyond tedious. Then when you must activate an item such as a lever, they want it to be almost exactly on point, and this is more of a pain because most items you must activate are small and hard to get Lara to stand in front of, which makes overall interaction with your enviornment annoying and a pain. The when you shoot, there is a horrid auto-aim mechanic that just makes her swing in circles over and over when enemies move, and she generally stays locked on, so when that enemy is dead, you can bet she'll stil lbe standing there shooting it's dead body. This is somewhat humorous... but a pain in the butt. Generally you are being attacked by 2 or more enemies, so shooting the dead body just ends up getting you killed, and her reflexes are horrible, so turning usually results in more attacks from your enemies, and a dead Lara. This is very tedious, and I do not know how the developers left it like this, and just makes me think  even more that this game is cheap and half-way done.     To end, the game has no soundtrack. Yep, none. The only thing you hear is a looped boom and crumble-like sound that just makes the pretty repetitous and bland enviornments even more so. This not only adds to the overall boredome this game provides, but makes it very annoying to play, and I am thankful the developers at least added the option to turn it off.     Overall, this could have been AMAZING... but because of bad aging and horrible PC controls, it is a horrid train-wreck of an excuse for a ""game"". The only really good factor is it's saving mechanism, considering it actually functions quite well and is quite fast. Overall i'd give this a 3/10, considering the amount of happiness you fel when you actually get the games mechanics down to a point. For anyone other than die-hard TOMB RAIDERS, i'd say stay away from this game at all costs.			"

												BEFORE YOU SAY OH YOU HATE THIS GAME READ THE REVIEW THEN READ THE UPDATEThis is a review of how long I played and what I think of it. I have never played Tom Raider until today. It is considered a classic in the adventure genre and I can somewhat agree. But there is a huge problem. The game hasn't aged well. Lets talk about the most important aspect of a game. Controls. You seem to move in a tight grid for some reason and I don't know why. If you take a great game like Doom at the time, the controls were amazing. It made you feel free to move. But here, the control is the most difficult part of the game. If you are playing on windows 8 which I am, do not press the windows button. If you do, the game will crash for no reason. It is the stupidest thing ever. Anyways you have to press alt and control to jump and to climb up ledges and space to get your guns out. But sometimes, its confusing because I think I am pressing alt when I'm pressing Space! Who thought it would be a good idea to make space not the button for jumping?! ALL GAMES HAVE THAT! Also, it crashes randomly for no reason. But as long as you get used to them, you will be fine. I just hope Anniversary's controls are better than this. But anyways, its fun and you want to keep playing to see what you will find. Its nice.I have only played at least 1-1/4 of a hour of it so I might post a bigger review of it soon.*UPDATE* The game has a glitch I found that is beyond repair. When you get to the Lost Valley, you will find a dinosaur and when it attacks you, you're computer monitor will go upside down. Thanks. Now I can't play it. Unfotunately, I will have to play Anniversary in order to play the games in order now. Which sucks. But I do know it follows the same plot with some new levels and reimagined stuff.			"

												This game is bad. Saying that it isn't intuitive is an understatement. After frustration of trying to figure out simple maneuvers, I found the menu that shows controls, only to have camera angle (defined in game as ""look"") just say PADO. It has to run through emulation software called dos box which may or may not crash on you occasionally. It's hard to believe Soul Reaver and Mario 64 came out around the same time as this. What I did happen to think was pretty neat was that in the Steam menu you can access the original manual, which starts with an introduction to Laura's beginnings. Which are the same ones they went by when they made the 2013 game. The prequel holds true to a page in a manual from 17 years ago.			"

												Man oh man, where do I start?Let me preface this by saying I'm not comparing Tomb Raider 1 to modern games. That wouldn't be fair. No, this game is bad even for the time it came out.The biggest problem for me are the controls. First, as far as I can tell, there is no native support for gamepads or even the mouse. The former is somewhat understandable (even relatively recent games often lack this, even when they're console ports), but the latter is totally inexcusable for a game made in 1996. There are ways to map the keys to a modern controller, but that's of limited use because the controls are AWFUL. Basic movement is okay; the game uses tank controls, which work okay... unless you have to move quickly, in which case you're pretty screwed. Jumping is finicky, and the positions you have to be in for certain jumps (or to pick up items or flip switches) are super precise. Lara runs by default, and you'll almost always have to stop, turn in place, and walk slowly to get to the exact spatial point the game wants you to be in to pick something up or flip a switch.There is also NO camera control. Oh, you can look around while you're standing still; but you can't move the camera while Lara is in motion, and it springs right back to the default fixed camera angle as soon as you let go on the look button. This often means making jumps onto ledges or whatnot that you can't actually see.A game with controls like this should also not have an emphasis on combat, or if it does the enemies should be slow. Instead, there's tons of combat and EVERY SINGLE ENEMY IN THE GAME is faster than you, and will often stun-lock you to death. Thankfully, you don't really have to aim - Lara will do that herself - but sometimes the autoaim just plain doesn't work, or it won't point at the enemy you want.There are also a number of timed precision platforming puzzles in the game that are nearly impossible with the game's terrible control scheme. In fact, one of them in one of the last levels I literally couldn't get through except by glitching the game physics out and forcing Lara through a hole she wasn't supposed to be able to get through.There are also a few bugs I encountered, though I'm not sure if these are the game's fault or DOSBox's. Certain areas will be dark the first time you come through, but then if you reload the save it will be well-lit (or vice versa). There's also several points in the second to last level where Lara will sometimes just burst into flame for no reason (apparently a problem with the hitbox detection on the lava). Unfortunately, Core Design's been dead for seven years, so I don't know who to send a bug report to.I honestly don't know how anybody beat this game on a console or in the original PC version, which only had save points. The only way I was able to complete it with my sanity intact was to save every couple minutes - more or less every time I completed a difficult jump or killed a few enemies. Even so, the game is infuriating. It took me 21 hours to complete; without the ability to save anywhere, it probably would have been double or triple that. (Or more likely, I just would've given up.)			"

												Controls are horid. I realize this game is from 1996, but even so just walking around in the level takes intense concentration. The directonial keys only take Lara's angle into account, rather than the current viewing angle like most modern games. Should Lara be facing the camera, then pressing the 'Forward button' will move her towards the camera, rather than turning around and actually walking 'forward' from the camera's perspective.Bought this game when it was 75% off. Nice to have in the collection, but definitely wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.			"

												Honestly, I really wouldn't recommend this to a fellow fan of the series. It's mostly becasue of how poorly it's put together. When you look at a cinematic cutscene, it's poorly colored and heavily pixelated. I understand it's most likely a port from console, but it seems like no one put forth any effort to clean it up for a PC monitor. Further problems I've noticed are the selected control bindings. I was so happy that I would finally be playing a childhood favorite of mine, and I expected that I would get to customize my key bindings; this was not the case obviously. I did, however, have two choices for binding sets. Neither of them are very intuitive. It was actually quite painful to try and learn them. I tried fiddling with the resolution becasue it was bugging me a bit and it crashed the game. I tried multiple times at different menus and parts of the game, but I was unsuccessful. It might be better for someone who is more skilled with their fingers and is savvy with changing gameplay visuals than I. Gameplay graphics are a bit buggy, but so were the originals so... _                _                                                                                                               \_(o.o)_/Audio is also a bit weird too, sort of like they recorded it from a TV.Hope this helped (More importantly I hope the people who ported this sees this and takes action) "

												Let me say this first, I have never played a Tomb Raider/Lara Croft game ever. I saw this game on steam for sale for $1.74 and was like, you know what, I've never played any Tomb Raider game before, let’s try this out. I downloaded the game and then launched it. The cut scenes in the game are horrible, I think they used a video compressor to compress the videos so that they wouldn't take up a lot of space or something. I played the first part of the first mission, it took me 25 minutes to beat it because I needed to learn the controls and how they worked and I needed to learn how the game worked. Like the cut scenes, the combat is also horrible in this game (mostly because the controls are bad.) Thank god it auto-aims for you. I also don't like the camera angles, most of the time the camera angle is fine but sometimes it goes into a weird and awkward position. I also didn’t like that you can't run left or right, like you must turn to the direction you wanted and then you pressed forward to go that way. Honestly, the game has a very good concept to it, you run in a tomb and explore it with not knowing what lies ahead, I like that, but since the controls are wonky and some mechanics are weird, I can't recommend the game to someone who is new to the Tomb Raider series. I will try to play the game more and try to learn the controls better. The only people I can recommend this game to is classic gamer, fans of the tomb raider series or PS1 game fans. In conclusion, the game has a very good concept of exploring caves, but the controls ruin the combat, jumping, and movement.			"

Not a lot is explained, you have to figure out everything yourself.But after a while they become fairly familiar, I like the feature that you have to press Ctrl for holding the edge of a wall.They graphics, They don't mind. really, you find it strange in the beginning, but you become used to it. It even is scary sometimes...The story and gameplay is great too, hard but not too hard. reminds me of WoW vanilla, then it was without quest-helper, you had to write everything down.If you find 7.00€ too much, you could buy it from K i n g u i n . n e t .Hope you have fun ;)			"

												In Tomb Raider, the player controls the female archaeologist Lara Croft, in search for the three mysterious Scion artefacts across the world. The game is presented in third person perspective. Lara is always visible and the camera follows the action from behind or over her shoulder. The world she inhabits is fully drawn in three dimensions and characterised by its cubic nature. Ledges, walls and ceilings mostly sit at 90 degrees to each other, but sometimes feature sloping planes.The object of Tomb Raider is to guide Lara through a series of tombs and other locations in search of treasures and artefacts. On the way, she must kill dangerous animals and other creatures, while collecting objects and solving puzzles to gain access to an ultimate prize, usually a powerful artefact. Gunplay is restricted to the killing of various animals that appear throughout each stage, although occasionally Lara may be faced with a human opponent. Instead the emphasis lies on solving puzzles and performing trick jumps to complete each level. As such, Tomb Raider in essence harkens back to the classical form of platform style gameplay.			"

												Completed in 2015 and still fun to play!  Totally recommend Tomb Raider I still.  The game is weak on graphics sure but once you put it to 1080p resolution it's fine.  The puzzles and the frustration before an enormous satisfaction when finally completed is worth the trouble to put the time into the very fun but dated game. It's very surprising how long this game takes to beat, something like a little over an hour per level for myself (18.2hrs for 15 levels).  I played with a Xbox 360 controller (You can find a really simple way to set it up online with a downloaded file and a text file edit).  The only visual kind of alteration I did was tweak some text files again to change resolution and cutscenes to play at 1920x1080.  Expect to save many, many,many times, by the end of the game you will become a master at quicksaving at almost every important jump or discovery as you will find out the controls can be a bit frustrating to deal with at times.  Honestly I would say stick it out and complete it if you enjoy it, I played a little bit at a time, often quiting halfway through a level, but you will make it eventually and won't regret it.  Had a few times where I thought the game was broken and there was no way of progressing, and everytime I checked on a guide online I smacked my forehead as I discovered sometimes the smallest, and sometimes the most obvious thing ever.  In short go play it, even if it's only an hour or a level at a time, the graphics can be ignored and the controls can be adapted to.			"

												This is one of those older games along with the original Sonic the Hedgehog and Metroid that happens to be mediocre, and no one ever really says it is. For some reason, these games are considered ""classics"", ""timeless"", and called the best games of all time. And I heavily disagree on Tomb Raider (1996) being considered one of the best games ever.I grew up on Anniversary, so as it usually is when I play a really good modern remake or sequel, and play its highly-praised  predecessor I end up very disappointed. Anniversary was alive with dynamic music, great characterization, and creative level design. And the original that it's based off of is... incredibly dull.Now, you might say I have no appreciation for older games, and need to praised them more for their ""historic impact"" on the gaming industry. A game could have certainly done a lot for the cause of gaming, but the games that have built off the foundations laid by these games and made something really special. Think about it. Do you, personally, know the first film ever made? The first Oscar winner? If so, do you consider them the among the likes of The Godfather and Citizen Kane? Of course not! Then why should we give so much credit to the original Super Mario Bros. and Grand Theft Auto III? They are fun, but they aren't anything special, like other much better-made games like The Last of Us or The Unfinished Swan. The only problem with this for Tomb RaideR 96 is.... it's not even fun! The game felt more like a chore than an escapist video game that I could have fun playing, because everything is the game is so slow- from Lara's tank-like controls, her awkward and unpredictable jumping, and massive wait-time on pushing crates around. The puzzles in the games are a little challenging, but the main platforming of the game completely falls flat, since it's so stilted and strange to control. Even more so is the ""combat"", which is basically jumping and holding the ""shoot"" button until everyone in the cave/room/corridor is dead. The sound is nearly inexistent. Sure, the sounds can be ambient and this was the 90's so games like these weren't that technologically impressive. But any ambience the music could possibly muster is brought down by the very short draw-distance, which breaks the illusion that the game I'm playing is a game. Especially when the characters have no personality behind the one line they speak in cutscenes. I liked Anniversary's take on the original, because Lara Croft was a complete badass. She would kill when necessary, and faced her obstacles with daring in the expressions she made on her face in the cutscenes. Sure, you could say, ""Lara in the original Tomb Raider could have been easily replaced by a man, which shows that they've handled her well."" But the whole marketing for Lara Croft is her very obvious sex appeal, and it was nice that she showed a lot more unique talents for her gender that she used to her advantage in Anniversary. I'm not saying I had Tomb Raider 96, either. It's just pretty average. But you have these die-hard fans that think it's superior to Underworld, Legend, and Anniversary- which had a better focus on character and story (again, they're not perfect either) which blew the simplistic, tomb-raiding 90's video game out of the water. If you like Tomb Raider, fine. I don't care. But I have my own standard for games, and if you haven't played Tomb Raider and have a feeling that your standards are similar to mine... you'll probably not enjoy this game like I didn't.			"

												Okay, WOW! i just made this game to end today. The first Tomb Raider game ever! Wow, there´s so many things, that had been recreated so much different through the time. Actually, i played this game, because i wanted to see, how much it had changed since that time. Just WOW! it´s unbelieveable, how much the series had changed at just 10 years! There´s just something i want to tell all TR fans outthere: If you´re a real fan of the series, then complete this game first, then the 10th anniversary game and at last, complete the newest reincarnation of the series, Tomb Raider 2013. The whole point of this is: They are all connected to each other. That´s just the thing, that´s so amazing about the series. It´s one of the most iconic female game characters through the time. I know, that i´m just beginning to be a very big fan of the series, but it´s so amazing! Now, i actually know, how it all started, and how Lara Croft has get to end, she is at right now. The story of the game is really empressing in the Anniversary of the game. All of the characters just get´s their own identity in the reincarnation. Because you actually never knows, how they fit in, into the story. They just summon at some random spots. But in the new game, they all stands together, trying to eliminate Lara. I recommend this game to all THE REAL Tomb Raider fans outhere. Because the point is, that you can only like this game, if you really want´s to know how the so much iconic character got to, what she is now. There is a lot of moves and controls, you have to learn. The worst thing for me, was just the thing about, that you can´t use the mouse for this game. You have to make your own controls for the game. But that´s just, how classic games where once. Everybody out there: Always remember this charcter. Never forget, how iconic she is. Never forget, how famous she is. never forget, how important she is for our world of game history. Always have your memories about her in your mind, and do not lose control! But if you don´t mind about all  that: Be an adventurer! Have some fun with your favourite female video game character: Lara Croft! :) ;)			"

I got excited when I finally got to complete 'Lara's home' without crashing to desktop.  Then I enter the first level and Lara looks up then BANG   a big picture of lara's face comes up and my computer crashes.  The crash also flipped my computers screen upside down, and set it to the lowest resolution.Get a playstation 1 and get the proper thing I say.			"

												When I first started up the first Tomb Raider, I looked at Lara's polygons, and I thought: wow, I should just uninstall this crap... I mean the voice acting in the first intro is so lame, and how the rich woman is trying to buy Lara with money, when she clearly isn't in it for the money... And then I almost ragequit because the controls seemed clunky, making me feel like I'm playing the first Prince of Persia (the DOS game), the main protagonist with a turn rate so huge that no LoL player  would be able to bear it, and it ran on DOSBox. Yet I managed to get through the first level, get frustrated on the second level because I couldn't find the key for the door, and I still kept playing. This is a good game because it gives player an adventure, not just mindless shooting (although mindless shooting still helps to kill the wolves and smaller raptors). This game has exploration and you need to look for items that are hard to find (there are many secret item spots), but you also have to avoid traps, be quick and careful at the same time.			"

												Nearing 20 years on since its debut in '96, the original Tomb Raider makes for an interesting beast. Once a cutting edge invitation to a brand new era of 3D video games, today it offers a trip back in time to the rather primitive beginnings of modern gaming. But that sure doesn't make it any less fascinating.The controls, of course, stand out right away for their inaccessibility compared to modern standards. The famous ""tank"" movement scheme, though, is easier to acclimate to than you might expect. Thanks to the game being in full 3D with a proper behind-the-back camera, you'll be moving forward most of the time anyway, using left and right to subtly ""steer"" Lara as you go. It isn't perfect (and in combat situations much less so), but it's never the mess that similar controls can create in 2D environments, like in the early Resident Evils.More surprising is how finicky the jumping mechanics are. When standing still, the jump button must be pushed just before the direction to jump in, while running jumps over gaps have a specific logic to their timing that makes Lara jump automatically the moment she reaches a platform's edge. Points like these mean it's important to get acquainted with the game's eccentricities before you begin, but doing so is quick and easy thanks to a concise and effective tutorial that's selectable at any time from the main menu.So once you've done that, and gotten into the mindset of a late '90s gamer, what lies before you? Why, one of the major milestones of video game history, of course. Considered in context, it's easy to see why Tomb Raider was such a big deal for its time. Releasing in the same six-month window as the original Quake and Super Mario 64, it gave its players an early taste of the sort of freedom of exploration that we take for granted today. And explore you will, as you make your way from room to room, throwing switches, finding keys, and stumbling across cleverly hidden item pickups, with little to guide you but your own skills of observation. At its core, this is a puzzle game about navigating 3D spaces, figuring out where you need to go next, and how to get there. These design principles are some that still form the basics of many modern games, so its only natural that they remain entertaining all these years later.There's no denying that Tomb Raider is showing its age, and from start to finish you're not likely to forget that it was originally built for the Sega Saturn. But if you're willing to learn to play by its rules, you'll find that Lara Croft's debut outing is still a satisfying adventure, and her quest to uncover an ancient treasure has become something of an ancient treasure all its own.

The game is highly recommend and i would like to say that it certainl stands the test of time. My background, i was playing tomb  raider blindly for the first time in 2003 on my PSP PS1 Portit was such a amazing experience. Tomb Raider 1-3 is considered by me to be some of the absolutely most tightly designed games in 3d game design, with games like Zelda Ocarian of Time and Super Mario 64 being in the same position...

												Tomb Raider was the first game I owned for PS1 and it took me a long time to finish but I'm back for more.  Still, this is a great game and fun after all these years.  The game uses DOS Box, which crashes from time to time.  Not a deal breaker, because it never happens to me during gameplay only when I'm trying to get back into windows.  I still have not found an easy way to play Tomb Raider in windowed mode.  You have 16 ""save anywhere"" files.  This save mechanic makes the game so much better, as getting back to an area that is hard to get through, only to end up jumping and falling to your death for the 20th time gets old fast.  Save anywhere is much appreciated.  You can use it a lot or not much at all, which is awesome either way.As for game controls, I am using a ""SNES like"" iBuffalo Classic usb Gamepad, Serial number A504510 with the JoyToKey gamepad free software for key mapping. This is the only way I could get the shoulder, start, and select buttons to work.The game just didn't feel right using the keyboard.  I only use the keyboard for menus now.Hope this was helpful.  Keep on gaming. "

												Twenty five hours and over 200 save files my dedication is satisfied.For a game that is nearly older than I am, it isn't too shabby. The story is odd and don't know how well I followed it through the odd twists and turns. The enemies were far more varied than I expected. Bats, monkeys and tigers: whatever... But then raptors and a T-Rex: we are going somewhere... All the sudden exploding zombies, giant-flying-zombie-mummy-whatever-the heck things and a massive supernaturally engineered torso zombie start attacking you and your puny guns are nearly useless. The shooting is frustrating because it is auto-aim only and the game completely lacks any stealth gameplay that I love. It is a fun time, but will test your self-control as it taunts you into self destruction.Jump, jump, jump, and jump some more... Oh wait, not that far.... Ha, too short... Nope, only this jump works. The jumping mechanic was quite frustrating sometimes. Each platform jump sequence (which is most of the gameplay) has set jumping requirements that each only work for a certain gap. The running jump can easily overshoot a smaller gap, come up inches too short from a ledge and ultimately lead to multiple thudding demises. Every running jump must have one full ""block"" to make the jump (i.e. if you start a running jump just inside a block, you will be unable to jump before the ledge), this can be quite frustrating when blocks are lined up like paver stones: you think you can just run and bound off each one holding the jump button, sorry this does not work. SAVE AFTER EVERY LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENT. The standing jump can either go forward, up, or to either side; these jumps are used for very specific jumps as well. For vertical jumps, Lara must slam her face into the wall or dangle her toes on the edge of the platform to successfully grab the ledge above. The side jumps are fantastic for fighting enemies from a slight distance because you take less damage and continue shooting even upside-down.Possibly the worst part about this game is the camera. Lining up a jump when the third person perspective camera is cockeyed looking at the front of the character and unable to be moved in favor of a more comfortable viewing angle can be quite frustrating and lead to more deaths from simply missing a jump. The ""Look"" function is also quite clunky as the camera continues to be affected by walls and objects.Oh, and another major critique of this game is DosBox emulator itself is trash (Again Save, save, save again, and don't forget to save), it will crash dozens of times.All-in-all worth the playthrough and I am looking forward to the rest of the games since the newer one was quite good. Save twice, jump once.			"

												Before I get to the point, I should note that I am a big fan of the Tomb Raider series and enjoyed most of the titles, with TR1-5 being my favourite.It worked for me, the dosbox is not that bad if you learn how to handle the options and save! , and remember to always turn vsynch on to decrease the probabilities of CTDs. As for the game, it is just like in PS1 and even better at some points, the graphics looks decent for it's age and I noticed less screen flicking and glitches than the original. The in game speed is greatly increased as well.Now, for a full experience I recommend looking on the tutorial on how to use a gamepad with it as well as how to make the game read the original music.I wound't recommend it to someone new in the TR series because it is hard to manage, control and play. But for the hardcore fans it's a must have in their collection.			"

												Tomb Raider 1 was the very first game I played. Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness was the first game I ever personally owned and ever since then I have had so much love for the franchise. Sure, the games are old and the controls are a bit awkward but I still recomend them to everyone, even those that arent very big gamers. Its a great action and puzzle-solving game which has a geniunely interesting and entertaining story and I honestly cannot wait to play through the game that my step-dad and I bonded over, nearly 17 years later. This game came out the same year I was born and I was introduced to it when I was just 3 maybe 4, maybe a little too young but the love and nostaligia I feel when playing any of the games in the franchise negate the issue of my age. This game is a must play.			"

												I remeber seeing this game in a mgazine before it launched i seen that the lara was swiming . At this time I was looking for open world adventure game for the platstation. And boy was i joyed to see that article about tombraider. And at this time resident evil was out and i really wasnt that inteerest in resident evil but alot peeps loved it. At that time i believe there was a silent battle betwween tombraider people and resident evil people. Its like the people that playefd resident evil didnt know tomb raider existed and vise versa and i was like really tomb riader is the best game. Eventually i played resident evil and i did like it but tomb raider will always bring back that nastalgia feeling. Tomb raider 2 was also a good game. tomb raider 3 kinda killed it for me she started leaving the tomb raiding which was kinda a turn off didnt really like the area 51 lvl so i stop playing them. Tombraider 1 and 2 are awsome. Blood omen legacy of kain the first one is a good game too the others suck. I know that game has nothing to do with this review but hey check it out it may become ur favrite game to if you agree with my review of tombraider.			"

												The purest Tomb Raider experience that it creator only wanted to make a single game.  Back then in 1996 the story was well ahead of its time.  Who would of thought the game would be about .....  haha got you there no spoilers.  Still the platforming is excellent and the learning curve is fair until you get to level 5 which really ramps up the difficulty.  I still think its better than 2 and 3 (Rev and Chronicles (Really an expansion to Rev) should of been the true sequel)2 is far to hard for first timers and sometimes pretty cryptic - dont get me started with 3....  Stupid monkies.4 weapons, Pistols, Magnums, Uzis and Shotgun.  All have its purpose in combat.  But the real purpose of the game is navigating the tombs and solving the door puzzles (all challenging and fair).Boss in final level has a hilarious death animation for Lara.Its truely a shame that CORE dont make the games anymore.  I wished they continued Angel of Darkness in memory of them.Still way better than Context Sensitive Raider - That game focused on more about combat than platforming and puzzle solving in a smaller scale.9/10			"

												One of the best gameplays out there. Nice graphics considering the original publish date. Userfriendly UI, easy-to-understand controls.Only flaws:-Texture touching lines are often glinting black-Some similar rendering issues ( e.g. medikits visible through walls )-Buttons get stuck from time-to-time ( e.g. Lara keeps turning right unless you restart the game )I am convinced, that these problems are mainly caused by the emulation. So thats the price for being still able to play these old games, which is fine in my opinion.I dont think it fully worth the 7 Euros though, unless you are a hardcore TR fan, and you cant wait for a discount. With discount it's definitelly a great game to have and play with.			"

												There is very little i can say about how good this game is that hasn't already been uttered a million times at least. The graphics are dated but hell i look a little older than i did when the game came out so thats no critism is it?The gameplay is solid and the story a lot of fun. If you are looking for an enjoyable platformer then here is the motherload.However, i would recomnd either getting it from the playstation store for PS3 or digging out the PS1 and going at it on their as the controller port to steam is poor. very poor... ok pretty much non-existant. There is also the ever lovable issue of the emulator deciding to crash if you leave it paused for a while when you get pulled away for work etc and forget to close it. This may be an issue with my PC but not soething you would have to contend with using a console.Also mainly posted this as steam kept on shouting at me for never reviewing anything			"

												Old School Lara in all her pixelated glory! The original Tomb Raider was one of the most influential and ambitious titles of the 90's. It blended a 3d world with platforming like no game before it. It may not have aged well but it is impressive none the less when you consider its release date. Definately worth a buy for nostalgia purposes or just to see how far the series has come. 8/10.			"

												Okay, WOW! i just made this game to end today. The first Tomb Raider game ever! Wow, there´s so many things, that had been recreated so much different through the time. Actually, i played this game, because i wanted to see, how much it had changed since that time. Just WOW! it´s unbelieveable, how much the series had changed at just 10 years! There´s just something i want to tell all TR fans outthere: If you´re a real fan of the series, then complete this game first, then the 10th anniversary game and at last, complete the newest reincarnation of the series, Tomb Raider 2013. The whole point of this is: They are all connected to each other. That´s just the thing, that´s so amazing about the series. It´s one of the most iconic female game characters through the time. I know, that i´m just beginning to be a very big fan of the series, but it´s so amazing! Now, i actually know, how it all started, and how Lara Croft has get to end, she is at right now. The story of the game is really empressing in the Anniversary of the game. All of the characters just get´s their own identity in the reincarnation. Because you actually never knows, how they fit in, into the story. They just summon at some random spots. But in the new game, they all stands together, trying to eliminate Lara. I recommend this game to all THE REAL Tomb Raider fans outhere. Because the point is, that you can only like this game, if you really want´s to know how the so much iconic character got to, what she is now. There is a lot of moves and controls, you have to learn. The worst thing for me, was just the thing about, that you can´t use the mouse for this game. You have to make your own controls for the game. But that´s just, how classic games where once. Everybody out there: Always remember this charcter. Never forget, how iconic she is. Never forget, how famous she is. never forget, how important she is for our world of game history. Always have your memories about her in your mind, and do not lose control! But if you don´t mind about all  that: Be an adventurer! Have some fun with your favourite female video game character: Lara Croft! :) ;)			"

												Absolutely horrible. Relies on a dos emulator which crashes constantly. I've had to fiddle with my graphics drivers and everything to get this piece of crap to work.  I got excited when I finally got to complete 'Lara's home' without crashing to desktop.  Then I enter the first level and Lara looks up then BANG   a big picture of lara's face comes up and my computer crashes.  The crash also flipped my computers screen upside down, and set it to the lowest resolution.Get a playstation 1 and get the proper thing I say.			"

												Doesn't work well on newer devices and os's but plays beautifully on Windows XP. Opening the steam overlay when paused can cancel all input to DOSBox and leave the overlay stained on your screen, which forces you to open task manager. However, doing so crashes the emulator. (♥♥♥♥ing useless). It is a good game, a classic one, and if you are living in the past (or just like retro operating systems) and can afford anything, I cannot recommend it enough. The controls can be a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but all in all, one of the best games valve offers.			"

												When I first started up the first Tomb Raider, I looked at Lara's polygons, and I thought: wow, I should just uninstall this crap... I mean the voice acting in the first intro is so lame, and how the rich woman is trying to buy Lara with money, when she clearly isn't in it for the money... And then I almost ragequit because the controls seemed clunky, making me feel like I'm playing the first Prince of Persia (the DOS game), the main protagonist with a turn rate so huge that no LoL player  would be able to bear it, and it ran on DOSBox. Yet I managed to get through the first level, get frustrated on the second level because I couldn't find the key for the door, and I still kept playing. This is a good game because it gives player an adventure, not just mindless shooting (although mindless shooting still helps to kill the wolves and smaller raptors). This game has exploration and you need to look for items that are hard to find (there are many secret item spots), but you also have to avoid traps, be quick and careful at the same time.			"

												This is one of my favourite games ever.  Visually it is very dated but, if you can look past that, the level design is excellent.  So are the story and dialogue.  Sadly I think overall the Playstation version is better than the PC version.  It has more music tracks (which are beautiful) and you can use a controller with more buttons.  Because the PC version is for DOS, you can only use a 4 button controller.  I imagine there is a way to use a controller with more buttons but it seems like a lot of hassle.  The PC version does have better graphics than the Playstation version.I recommend getting the Playstation version instead if you can.			"

												I'll skip the whole novel-stating-why-I-♥♥♥♥ing-love-Tomb-Raider, and instead give you just a brief rundown of what you should expect from Tomb Raider I.Backstory: Tomb Raider was a PS1 launch title that BLEW UP because of how amazing it was- no joke. Lara Croft became infamous for her ""triangle ♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" because her breasts were mere triangles instead of the round jiggly thingies we have today. Tomb Raider is an ongoing franchise that features Lara Croft as the protagonist who either struggles to survive, or go on a massive search for some artifact. Storyline: You are Lara Croft- a world known archeologist on a search for something called ""The Scion"" which a mysterious person named ""Natla"" has informed you about. Lara Croft is a bad♥♥♥♥♥ dual pistol wielding girl who lives for adventure.Gameplay: Okay, now you have to take into account that this game was made in 1996- a PS1 launch title to be fair, so the gameplay functionality is going to be on-par with these next generation titles. Tomb Raider is a 3D platform-adventure game with gun mechanics that actually work. Tomb Raider also integrates puzzles into this platforming-adventure experience, so not only do you have a compelling story, but also a great genre scheme. Sound: Since this is an outdated game, the sound effects can come out quite poor at some times due to the lower files not being supported by newer tech. If you have high teir headphones, you will know what i'm talking about. Graphics: I keep going back to the topic of it being from the 90s, but it's true and it's age really puts a show on it's graphics, sounds, and just gameplay in general. The textures can be a bit bad and look unrendered to it's full potential at times, but it still works and looks... ok.. for it's time. Lots of elements found on the ground are sprites including the pickups like health packs, ammo packs, and artifacts. Overall, it's not TOO BAD, but it's nowhere as good as the sequals. Conclusion: If you haven't found out already- Tomb Raider is AMAZING. If you have not played it, what is wrong with you? Stop reading this, scroll up, and click ""Add to Cart"".			"

												Great game, great memories. Controls kind of suck at first but you can either get used to them (like what I did) or change the layout. Tomb Raider 1 was the first game I got when my parents bought a Sega Saturn. Definitely takes me back some 16 years. It's been fun so far and  I definitely recommend it, being able to save as much as you want definitely makes it more enjoyable versus having to use save crystals like in the console versions. I also just recently beat the game and I feel like I finally got some closure on a childhood memory.			"

												Tomb Raider was a very well knwon game in the 90's, and still is today. The classics have been long forgotten and people of the newer generation (like me) generaly don't know about Tomb Raider. Thanks to Steam, we can re-capture those feelings of loneliness and isolation with just the click of a 'play' button.Tomb Raider (I) has no files missing and no major bugs (many minor ones as the game is quite old). The game is intirely play-able but the absense of game-pad support really takes away some of the experience, especially for former PS players, I would recomend Joy-to-Key or X-padder for game-pad support.The game itself is really great, if you have never played/heard of TR, you should buy it immediately and play through the intire game from start to finish, don't play any games between or you will most likely take away most of the atmosphere. The DOSBOX (emulator) software doesn't work very well so I would reccomend buying GLIDOS or dgVoodoo to play.Please buy TR1 as it was the ground-work for a brilliant franchise and playing the first adventure will always prepare you for the next.

												Few years ago when I watched the trailer for Tomb Raider reboot I was so amazed that decided to play it right away. But search results on Steam returned many more and so I decided to play those first. Winter sale was just around the corner so I waited a little bit and bought all of them. This is because I'm kind of man who likes to have a good look at the origin story because thinks that almost 20 years from game's release there may be something I could miss if I skipped all the previous ones.Obviously when we're talking about a game that is this old we're not looking for pretty graphics but rather an atmosphere, story and even feelings that it may bring. Talking about graphics characters are blocky and Lara's breasts could poke your eye out but that's fine by me. What I remember from the game after 2 years since playing it? I remember when I sat in a dark room for better immersion and rushing to the couch to make myself comfortable before any intros begin. It started with a nuclear blast somewhere in a desert and a conversation in some hotel in New Mexico. I was listening very carefully to consume all those story details that I wanted so badly. And that scene wasn't the most exciting thing in the game. But when I stepped into the caves I was hooked that very moment. It felt a bit scary even. It seemed like it was snowing inside my room and I could feel the cold. Thankfully I was able to put myself together and start playing.And so the game began. I had those famous double pistols I saw in Lara Croft movies. I tried moving around, shooting, figured out controls. But little did I know what was waiting for me in those caves. I liked a lot how the game was actually teaching me to paly. Even though I skipped the training course in the mansion (which I regret by the way). I was so immersed that my first encounter with the wolver scared the hell out of me. And probably it wasn't the wolf but the music that played when it appeared in from of me. But it wasn’t just the music that was adding to the atmosphere the sound effects in general. Howling winds, Lara's jogging, shooting sounds it was all great. But let's get to the gameplay, shall we? At firs it is no problem to progress. But farther I went the harder some puzzles became. I will try as spoiler-free as possible so I'll just focus on how it felt for me rather that what it was. And I think those puzzles actually shaped the game quite a bit. It felt so satisfying to solve some of them and they were quite logical and some of them even required knowledge of Greek mythology. Quite nice if you ask me. And sometimes there were hidden puzzles which would reward you with ammo and/or guns. And you need to be very attentive when you're looking for them. But it was totally worth it because even though you can complete the game with just your pistols having those cool guns makes the game much more interesting and shooting your foes more satisfying and badass. And you'll probably need those guns when you encounter the first boss in the caves.Bosses to Tomb Raider are awesome. They are not too easy or too hard to beat. All you need to do is some tinkering to find their weak spot or pattern of their attack and movement. So I would describe them as 'fun'. And this what games supposed to be - fun. And I had a lot of fun in general. They are not repetitive and diverse and that's what made me waiting to get to one. And what's great is that you don't always know when you find one. But be prepared anyway. And there's one thing that is keeping you from them are the levels and it's not something to sneeze at because you can get lost in some of them, some levels took me quite a white to find a way out of. Luckily you can save in any place at any time. And I found myself overusing it and sometimes I was saving a lot while being afraid of loosing my progress and instead I was loosing sense of immersion. Checkpoints is something I would totally appreciate but I don't think the concept was even there in 1996. There's wasn't quick save either. There was a button but you still had to select a save slot. Other than that I don't really have any complaints.Final level was very creepy and I wished I could complete it fast but it wasn't to be because it was quite large too. But I soldiered on and reached the final boss. And boy was it epic. I had big guns and was able to kick♥♥♥♥♥ If I said anything else I would spoil it all for you. Also remember to use your guns on your way to the boss because I found myself having to many unused ammo in some cases and sacrificed some fun while going through the levels before the boss.So there you have it. I totally recommend playing it especially now when you have it not only on PC but on mobile phones and tablets too. But beware that I recommend it to people who care about solid gameplay more than about graphics.More reviews from Gameaways Curator "

												This is one of those older games along with the original Sonic the Hedgehog and Metroid that happens to be mediocre, and no one ever really says it is. For some reason, these games are considered ""classics"", ""timeless"", and called the best games of all time. And I heavily disagree on Tomb Raider (1996) being considered one of the best games ever.I grew up on Anniversary, so as it usually is when I play a really good modern remake or sequel, and play its highly-praised  predecessor I end up very disappointed. Anniversary was alive with dynamic music, great characterization, and creative level design. And the original that it's based off of is... incredibly dull.Now, you might say I have no appreciation for older games, and need to praised them more for their ""historic impact"" on the gaming industry. A game could have certainly done a lot for the cause of gaming, but the games that have built off the foundations laid by these games and made something really special. Think about it. Do you, personally, know the first film ever made? The first Oscar winner? If so, do you consider them the among the likes of The Godfather and Citizen Kane? Of course not! Then why should we give so much credit to the original Super Mario Bros. and Grand Theft Auto III? They are fun, but they aren't anything special, like other much better-made games like The Last of Us or The Unfinished Swan. The only problem with this for Tomb RaideR 96 is.... it's not even fun! The game felt more like a chore than an escapist video game that I could have fun playing, because everything is the game is so slow- from Lara's tank-like controls, her awkward and unpredictable jumping, and massive wait-time on pushing crates around. The puzzles in the games are a little challenging, but the main platforming of the game completely falls flat, since it's so stilted and strange to control. Even more so is the ""combat"", which is basically jumping and holding the ""shoot"" button until everyone in the cave/room/corridor is dead. The sound is nearly inexistent. Sure, the sounds can be ambient and this was the 90's so games like these weren't that technologically impressive. But any ambience the music could possibly muster is brought down by the very short draw-distance, which breaks the illusion that the game I'm playing is a game. Especially when the characters have no personality behind the one line they speak in cutscenes. I liked Anniversary's take on the original, because Lara Croft was a complete badass. She would kill when necessary, and faced her obstacles with daring in the expressions she made on her face in the cutscenes. Sure, you could say, ""Lara in the original Tomb Raider could have been easily replaced by a man, which shows that they've handled her well."" But the whole marketing for Lara Croft is her very obvious sex appeal, and it was nice that she showed a lot more unique talents for her gender that she used to her advantage in Anniversary. I'm not saying I had Tomb Raider 96, either. It's just pretty average. But you have these die-hard fans that think it's superior to Underworld, Legend, and Anniversary- which had a better focus on character and story (again, they're not perfect either) which blew the simplistic, tomb-raiding 90's video game out of the water. If you like Tomb Raider, fine. I don't care. But I have my own standard for games, and if you haven't played Tomb Raider and have a feeling that your standards are similar to mine... you'll probably not enjoy this game like I didn't.			"

												Completed in 2015 and still fun to play!  Totally recommend Tomb Raider I still.  The game is weak on graphics sure but once you put it to 1080p resolution it's fine.  The puzzles and the frustration before an enormous satisfaction when finally completed is worth the trouble to put the time into the very fun but dated game. It's very surprising how long this game takes to beat, something like a little over an hour per level for myself (18.2hrs for 15 levels).  I played with a Xbox 360 controller (You can find a really simple way to set it up online with a downloaded file and a text file edit).  The only visual kind of alteration I did was tweak some text files again to change resolution and cutscenes to play at 1920x1080.  Expect to save many, many,many times, by the end of the game you will become a master at quicksaving at almost every important jump or discovery as you will find out the controls can be a bit frustrating to deal with at times.  Honestly I would say stick it out and complete it if you enjoy it, I played a little bit at a time, often quiting halfway through a level, but you will make it eventually and won't regret it.  Had a few times where I thought the game was broken and there was no way of progressing, and everytime I checked on a guide online I smacked my forehead as I discovered sometimes the smallest, and sometimes the most obvious thing ever.  In short go play it, even if it's only an hour or a level at a time, the graphics can be ignored and the controls can be adapted to.			"

												When I was child- first playing this game didn't seem so much of a big deal- there were a ton of other games that were a lot more colourful and brighter looking. After playing the newest edition of Tomb Raider i decided to go back, and as an adult- I've fallen in love with the parts my younger self could not. I love the audio, I love the levels, I love the puzzles, I love the visuals but most of all I love the adventure. Me and my brother both purchased the game and played it side by side- and we figured out all the puzzles together. There's this one puzzle that literally doesn't give you any clues except a name. It took me and my brother 3 hours to figure this one puzzle out- it wasn't until I remembered a song with the particular myth they were speaking of that we solved it. Visually- yea the graphics are clunky and dated- but as well as adding charmful nostaglia- I felt that the game overall was much much better than the newer edition! I loved that I didn't get much help- I loved the fact that I had to ration my supplies and I felt that everytime I found a new gun or solved a puzzle or found a secret- I was a Tomb Raider! The audio- isn't the best and while some of the voice actors are okay, some are obviously just the best they could get at the time. The music for what little there is- is nice- but most of the time your left with only the sound of your footsteps or what's around- which REALLY works as you have to use your ears to know what's coming or what lies beyond the path. If you really wanna sink your teeth into an adventure that has your thinking and on your feet- then your looking at the right game. Visually it's not the best and yea it can be glitchy- but it's a classic and still really holds up! "

												Tomb Raider I simply put... is a classic. The main focus in TRI are puzzle solving, platforming, and explorations with a a little action in between. It's all about the tombs! Unlike the sequels, the original is pretty basic. No outfit changes or extenstive weapon arsenals. Instead, Lara sticks with only four weapons, each sort of acting like an upgrade from the other. Tomb Raider I puts little emphasis on action and focuses more on atmosphere. The effect pays off well allowing the player to experience plently of memorable moments right down to a T-REX in a lost valley all the way to an alien ooze fest in Atlantis. Cool!The improvements in TR2-5 are mostly cosmetic and never did they drastically stray away from the formula TRI established. And why should they have? Master those controls and you'll understand why these earlier TR installments were a blast to play. It ALL starts right here with the original. Relive the mid 90's. You know you wanna!			"

If you can suspend disbelief and appreciate this game for how it appeared when it was released, you'll find the greatest, most authentic, action adventure classic! Interesting story, great environments, level design and puzzles. This game has an appropriate amount of combat but it's the exploration that truely drives this adventure. Still plays as great as ever!			"

												For its time, the original installment of the Tomb Raider series was a revolutionary game that not only helped cover more ground for the action-oriented genre, but also provided a paradigm shift for the games that feature a female protagonist as the lead, if not sole character. Lara Croft, in essence, is the Indiana Jones of the do-or-die relic hunter's world, prior to Indy's golden spotlight being usurped by Nathan Drake of the ""Uncharted"" series.The game elements of the original still provide exceptional nostalgic value for those who have played and beaten the game before, whether for only a rented fling or a repetitive display of skilled prowess. Pushing onward through Incan ruins only to discover a hidden world complete with a showdown with a Tyrannosaurus Rex is certainly enough for an action-seeking gamer to polish the edge of his/her seat and say, ""that's pretty awesome. What's next?""Although this catalyst of the series is not exactly education friendly, since somehow the names of Neptune and Thor show up in Greek ruins, the focus of the game overall is utilizing puzzle solving skills and preparation techniques as a means to survive the perils and pitfalls, find the artifacts, and inadvertently save the world from an ancient power-hungry demigod.Despite the archaic quality of the graphics, when compared to more modern games, Tomb Raider I still has yet to ever lose its overall value. The Tomb Raider series still runs strong, even with the most recent installment unnervingly having the exact same name as the first installment with no alteration (which would certainly explain Steam's decision to label the first three titles with Roman numerals). The series maintains its streak of popularity because of how groundbreaking the very first game actually was when it was first released in 1996. Lara Croft became one of the many bright-shining stars in the gaming universe, and playing this game will easily exhibit why.			"

Its dated presentation is charming, whilst other things, such as Lara's in-game character animations, hold up to today's standards. Very impressive for a 20 year old game indeed!If you care to run the game at your maximum reslution, another user has posted this guide:

												Truely a classic game and its age still holds up the test of time in my opinion. I can still see my younger 6 year old self playing this game like it was yesterday, and now at the age of 20 it's still a great game! I recommend this to anyone who has never had the chance to own a PS1 or have played any of the Tomb Raider games. The only minor cons I could think of are the controls and the minor graphical glitches since it is run on the DOSBox. If you decide not to purchase this one, then I recommend buying Tomb Raider Anniversary. Anniversary is a remake of the first Tomb Raider, has easier controls to get used to, and polished graphics for those not used to the blocky, pixalated polygons of the original. All in all 8.5/10 and some replayability if you are trying to look for all of the secrets :).			"

												In Tomb Raider, the player controls the female archaeologist Lara Croft, in search for the three mysterious Scion artefacts across the world. The game is presented in third person perspective. Lara is always visible and the camera follows the action from behind or over her shoulder. The world she inhabits is fully drawn in three dimensions and characterised by its cubic nature. Ledges, walls and ceilings mostly sit at 90 degrees to each other, but sometimes feature sloping planes.The object of Tomb Raider is to guide Lara through a series of tombs and other locations in search of treasures and artefacts. On the way, she must kill dangerous animals and other creatures, while collecting objects and solving puzzles to gain access to an ultimate prize, usually a powerful artefact. Gunplay is restricted to the killing of various animals that appear throughout each stage, although occasionally Lara may be faced with a human opponent. Instead the emphasis lies on solving puzzles and performing trick jumps to complete each level. As such, Tomb Raider in essence harkens back to the classical form of platform style gameplay.			"

												Tomb Raider I is a very interesting game to say the least. It has aged rather well but is clearly from the time period, and it sits strongly embedded in those roots from the level design right down to the controls. Lara herself controls like a tank. A very agile tank but still a tank. She moves slow, turns on a dime (if that dime was abnormally obese and the size of a small car) and her jumps respond about as quickly as a sloth. The controls and response times do take some getting used to because of this but once you get them the platforming becomes incredibly easier. This is good considering the gameplay itself is about 70-80 percent platforming with the remaining percent being loading from deaths and shooting it out with enemies. Although the platforming is very well done (once you get the controls down) the same can't exactly be said about the gunplay. It may not be the main focus, that belongs to the tomb raiding, it is certainly a big part and definitely the weakest area of the game. All fights boil down to ""hold fire and jump while moving to the side or back."" Now this shouldn't normally be a problem but due to the way the jump works (there is a delay by roughly half a second to a second from when you press it so the game knows how you want to jump i.e. forward, backward, standing, or sideways) it makes many fights frustrating when you accidentally jump straight up instead of to the side or back or vice-versa when you are close to ledges and jump off. That still also gets much easier as the game goes on and you get a better grasp on the controls and when you do the already mundane fights become chores to do as all that's left is to jump and hold fire until the enemy is dead. Aside from that I will say this game impressed me greatly with the variety of animations and the art direction though the locales were definitely generic Seriously!? 2 Areas?! You get a tomb in a mountain and 2 tombs in the same desert?! CAUTION SPOILER: Hell the third tomb was a boat ride away from the second in atlantis in a pyramid in a mine on an island in a lake in the desert?? /SPOILEREven though there are few larger locales many levels do have smaller areas with each feeling diverse and unique. The level design is lacking in some places though and you may have to consult a guide as  there are times the levels don't lead you anywhere at all and where you have to go isn't obvious. Also the game breaks its own rules from time to time. Overall a very enjoyable game. Get it if you enjoy older games or platformers with hard traps.			"

												IntroI know what you're thinking.  Damn, man, this thing is ugly.  Yeah, the low-poly models and low-res textures are a bit hard on the eyes.  I admit it.  But everything else is in such good order that you will very quickly be fully immersed.  The visuals will melt away and what you'll be left with is one of the most fantastic adventures in gaming history.  Bar none.ProsThe Tomb Raider franchise almost certainly requires no introduction and this first game in the series is, in my opinion, its best.  When gaming made its transition from 2D to 3D and from cartridges to optical media, Tomb Raider took astounding advantage of both.  The adventure is a sprawling epic that gifts players with a good many hours of challenging gameplay.  The environments are interesting and varied.  The puzzles and object hunts meld well with their contexts and level objectives.  The plot is fairly well developed and the dialogue is appropriately cheeseball.  The music and ambient sound, however, are extraordinary, even by today's standards.  Among the very best I have ever heard, period.ConsThe only criticism I would make of Tomb Raider - and it is very rarely a hinderance to enjoyable gameplay - is that the camera is a little wonky when Lara is in tight quarters.  This can make pathfinding a little rough on occasion.  Other than that and the understandably dated 3D graphics, however, the game is, to me, practically flawless.SetupLike a good many old school games here on Steam, Tomb Raider is delivered as a DosBox configuration, fully packaged and ready to go.  The team even went through the trouble of including a Glide emulator with the game, allowing the enhanced 3DFX graphics engine to provide a 640x480 resolution and mipmapping.  I strenuously recommend upgrading this to the very accessible nGlide by a fellow called Zeus.  It has me running the game at 4K resolution with tweaked gamma and I have to say, the result is stunning.  Yeah, I said it.  Xazuki offers an easy to follow guide here:

This review also applies to Tomb Raiders II through IV, and probably V and VI as well though I haven't played them yet.There isn't much to say about this game. The graphics are clearly something to sneeze at, and the audio is nearly nonexistant. There is no plot to speak of, and there isn't much variety in mechanics. The entire meat of this game is through the gameplay.Tomb Raider I has some pretty solid gameplay, but this is only true when we recognize that the game was released in 1996.  The movements, while extremely clunky, give you a wide range of mobility options for each scenario. In terms of how this game is meant to be played, it is unlike any other game I've played before: instead of emphasizing reflexes, strategy, or problem solving, this game test the player's dedication and perception. You are tasked with exploring many different landscapes where all of the textures look very similar, and this game pushes this test of perception to an extreme. This game is not for the feint of heart, and I certainly did not enjoy it very much.So why do I recommend it at all? Because I believe that it would be a very enjoyable experience in a group setting. If you have a team of people all soaking in your surroundings, you are much more likely to progress in the game, and find the crucial secrets that help you get extra medpacks. You can laugh at the corniness together, or maybe even try to progress through a level with everyone drunk. I believe that this would make a great game for a small friend group where everyone likes to experience new types of video games. The reason I did not enjoy the game when I played through it was because I was playing it alone, and heavily relied on a walkthrough so I wouldn't keep dying. But if you have some friends like on Game Grumps e.g., you can probably power through this game pretty quickly (and maybe have a walkthrough open just in case you guys get stuck as well).If you haven't played a Tomb Raider game before, this might be worth picking up. Play it with friends.			"

												I played this on a PS1 when it first came out, i have played through it at least 10 times. I was thinking about this game yesterday with a strong desire to play it again. I will always love this game.I don't care that the graphics are now terribad, it's an awesome game with an epic storyline, brilliant puzzles and the right amount of frustration to keep anyone busy for many hours.Over 20 years old still amazing			"

												Tomb Raider 1996 - ReviewIt’s hard to know how to review this game, if you hold it up to modern standards then of course it’s got more than its fair share of issues. But if you take it for what it is and compare it to games at the time it is one of the best games ever made.At the time of its release we has seen nothing like this, the graphics on both pc and console where fantastic and the game play and level design where fluid and expansive. It really did blow allot of people away. I won’t go into too much detail regarding Lara's history or legacy as we all know the impact she had on the video game industry as well as pop culture its self. So let’s begin.Tomb Raider puts you in the boots of arceologist Lara Croft who is approached by a rich and powerful business woman known as Natla to recover an artefact in Peru, and that is all that is know when Lara sets off on this adventure. The story on the whole is decent but It can be hard at times to piece together exactly what’s going on, I guess in modern gaming we are so used to incredible cinematic experiences that a handful of short FMV's and in game cut sense don’t quite cut it. The clues are there however and its a decent story that keeps the game moving on nicely. The game itself see's Lara tackle 4 areas that are broken up into 3 to 4 levels each, these are Peru, Greece, Egypt and finally Atlantis. The level design for the time is incredible and really second to none, its the classic Tomb Raider design of platforming, key/switch finding and occasional animal or boss battles but for the time is was fresh and exciting. My Only gripe with the levels is that each areas levels can feel repetitive from a graphical point of view, even though the layout of these levels are vastly different they use allot of the same styles and textures.From a graphics and sound stand point, for a 1996 game it looks and sounds great. 3D environments bring the world together and Lara’s character model looks good if not a little.....pointy. Only issues are a poor draw distance which can be quite jarring in 2016 and sounds sometimes don’t play when they are supposed too however this is an issue in both PC and console versions of the game. The levels don’t have a soundtrack as such, but more occasional sound bites as you adventure, or sounds play to symbolise and secret being discovered or door opening. Sounds of Lara's movements, gun fire and other NPC's are all good for 1996. Some character models of other humans could be improved however as the difference between them and Lara in quality is quite obvious.The game play is what we have all come to know, love and find frustrating. It’s the usual fair of run, jump, roll, dodge and shoot. There is allot more emphasis on platforming in Tomb Raider as opposed to the other games in the series and only a few enemies appear in levels. To be honest in 2016 Lara did not feel as ""tank"" like as I thought she might but it can be a challenge to move her around. More often than not I died because she did not jump when I wanted her too or due to the dated graphics a ledge was not as close as I thought. This was frustraiting in 1996 and is frustraiting in 2016 so be warned before you play. It did however not stop my overall enjoyment of the game and replaying it 20 years after it first came out was a complete joy. The PC version also bennifits from its ability to save wherever you like mid level, PlayStation and Saturn versions of the game had to make use of save cristals scattared thoughout the levels and this became more than a slight annoyance on the consoles.Over all Tomb Raider is a fantastic game, it blew us away in 1996 and in 2016 it’s not as hard to play as I thought it would be. The story is solid and helps move things forward nicely and the overall presentation for the time of release is top notch. This is all complemented with fantastic level design if not slightly aesthetically repetitive. On a modern PC with windows 10 the games runs well, only issues I had is FMV's stretch to fit the screen which can make them harder to watch and there is also a slight delay between them starting and playing on screen only a second or two but this really does not detract too much. Overall Tomb Raider is an all time great that will go down as a classic. - 9.2/10 - PC     9.0/10 - PS1/Saturn			"

												Dear Lord how did we play like this? lol! I know it's been 20 years, but I'd kind of forgotten about the controls, and with trying to play this on my laptop, with del, home, end, pgdown all out of wack is just unplayable lol - I'm off to find my game pad and see if I can get it working with this, nostalgia is one thing, but having Lara run around like I'm using touch controls is just not aceptable lolDid the first temple - game play was just as I remember, which is to say that if you grew up with this, you'll love it; if you grew up with the PS1, you'll be amazed how good it looks, and if you weren't born in 1996, you'll hate everything about this game today lol. If your first console was PS2 or later, go buy the remake of this - you'll have a much better time!			"

												This game is an absolute classic.I grew up watching my parents play this series and I would sometimes jump in. It's a fantastic game for it's time. I decided to pick this up to play through it again with my dad. Playing through it again, I can honestly say it's still a great game.It's unfortunate that this game is emulated and that it has some problems, but there are are ways to fix the issues. It's a small hassle, but adding the music, fixing controls, and changing the resolution makes the game worth going through again.			"

												When I first started up the first Tomb Raider, I looked at Lara's polygons, and I thought: wow, I should just uninstall this crap... I mean the voice acting in the first intro is so lame, and how the rich woman is trying to buy Lara with money, when she clearly isn't in it for the money... And then I almost ragequit because the controls seemed clunky, making me feel like I'm playing the first Prince of Persia (the DOS game), the main protagonist with a turn rate so huge that no LoL player  would be able to bear it, and it ran on DOSBox. Yet I managed to get through the first level, get frustrated on the second level because I couldn't find the key for the door, and I still kept playing. This is a good game because it gives player an adventure, not just mindless shooting (although mindless shooting still helps to kill the wolves and smaller raptors). This game has exploration and you need to look for items that are hard to find (there are many secret item spots), but you also have to avoid traps, be quick and careful at the same time.			"

I'm on lvl 10 and i have 330 saves. Why you ask? Because of clunky cotrols and camera movement. You will fall off so many ledges just because of those two and believe me, you will wana bash your head in( and then some more). It can be frustrating af. But if you are hard core fan of franchise go for it. It is a nice, insteresting game :)10/10 would bash my head in again. every. single. time			"

												This was the first game I ever played that left me sad to have completed it.My adventures with Lara had been so amazing, I didn't want it to end!That title music still melts my heart in fondness of those days spent taking Lara through her intrepid adventures, and I still say ""Right, let's go adventuring"" before setting out on any real life adventures!Graphically very dated even with the 3dfx patch and the 'huge world' of its day is significantly less impressive today but this was a real adventure and challenge that can surely still be enjoyed today, especially if you loved it so back in its day.More than the modern versions of the title. Tesselated breasts don't make up for the lack of challenge, particularly in the game's puzzles (though they are appreciated! :D )I still proudly keep the save games from my second run through all those years back where I managed to complete the game with only one save per level!If you've never played this original classic, then you simply must! If you have, then play it again! "

												I played the original on the PSX. It was great for it's day. It still is. My issue with the game is more technical though. First: This is a PSX to DOS port. The game literally starts it's own DOS prompt (using DOSbox) and launches. It does not run natively within windows. It's not a deal breaker, just annoying. In order to get the game into full screen or change any settings concerning graphics, input mapping, ect.... you have to alt+tab out of the game and get into DOSbox, change the settings you like, and then continue.Second: DOSbox does not correctly recognize joysticks or controllers. I've been using my PS3 Sixaxis controller for playing many games. Almost all PC games I've played work just fine with the controller. Not so much with this game. In fact, only 4 buttons on my controller work.Lastly: (And this is very important) There is no clear way that I have found to change the keyboard mapping. ""WASD"" can be set to move your character around, but you have to use buttons for the camera too! There is no mouse support for this game. (It runs in DOS) Which leaves you fumbling around just to make simple jumps. I never made it as far as any combat, though I'm sure that would have been a real pain in the rear.To conclude: Skip this one. I got it as part of a bundle, so I don't feel too bad for grabbing it. But seriously, skip it. Find it elsewhere. Find a better port. Pull out that old grey PlayStation sitting in your closet and scrounge EBay for an origional disc. Just whatever you do, do not willingly buy this game.			"

												Whilst suffering from an acute case of nostaligia I purchased the complete TR pack.  I had 'tested' the Steam waters with TR2 (my fave of all time) - a game I had played almost 20 years ago on a mac, with the keyboard.   Playing on the PC with a keyboard was no different  and even though I have most of the games on PS and Wii,   I bought the complete series - so far.So, with that background (knowing I ADORE TR)  here is my review;Tomb Raider I is a product of its time that can still be enjoyed today.  It would be enjoyed more if the Steam version had automatically added the free 'Gold'  levels and had automatically installed the patch that allows the last secret to be added to the count. TR I  - 6/5 stars cause the nostalgia adds a star onto a fun game 20 years old and still awesome.  Accept that it looks 'old'  and you have a wonderful, long puzzle adventure and shooting game that still makes me smile. "

												The Original and certainly a classic game.This game isn't just a great puzzle adventure / third person shooter it is now a Legacy.PC Gamers of Steam - this was a Sega Saturn release in my day and only after swapping platform to PS1 did it really take off, but is has never looked back as a franchise.Tomb Raider started an icon - Lara Croft - with its own branding, poster pin up, role models and films.This is the game that started it all - buy it for the history if nothing else.The gameplay is easy to get into - although stop concentrating adn you can fall off ledges even after hours of gameplay.The weapons lock on for you so its more a case of avoid taking danage through positioning and acrobatic manoeuvres.Solve puzzles, explore caves, monastaries, temples, underwater locations. Save points are sporadic but always well positioned by game devs. In its day the game had good replay value if you missed secrets too.Overall the storyline is interesting as well.			"

The PC version also bennifits from its ability to save wherever you like mid level, PlayStation and Saturn versions of the game had to make use of save cristals scattared thoughout the levels and this became more than a slight annoyance on the consoles.Over all Tomb Raider is a fantastic game, it blew us away in 1996 and in 2016 it’s not as hard to play as I thought it would be. The story is solid and helps move things forward nicely and the overall presentation for the time of release is top notch. This is all complemented with fantastic level design if not slightly aesthetically repetitive. On a modern PC with windows 10 the games runs well, only issues I had is FMV's stretch to fit the screen which can make them harder to watch and there is also a slight delay between them starting and playing on screen only a second or two but this really does not detract too much. Overall Tomb Raider is an all time great that will go down as a classic. - 9.2/10 - PC     9.0/10 - PS1/Saturn			"

												Here we are again, facing the mother of 3D Adventure Games, Tomb Raider 1. First of all, this game is old. Yes it is. But to be honest, even today people play games with graphics like Minecraft. So I don't think there should be a problem with the Graphics of this particular game. However, if there is a problem for someone, he can grab the anniversary Edition and enjoy the same(ish) game with pimped graphics.Even though the Graphics are old, they still inherit a great beauty. The Temples and Tombs look really pretty and make it fun to explore the different levels. Especially the last couple of levels look amazing. The story is good but short and not too deep. I liked it a lot though and wish that I get to know more about this story in the next Tomb Raider Games.The Level design is BRILLIANT. It's everything but linear and makes the game really hard to beat. I spent hours in the different levels trying to make out what I have to do to progress. This game for a change really made me think, which I greatly enjoyed.The only thing that made me sad is the fighting mechanics. Due to the fact that this game is very old, the mechanics are too easy for an experienced gamer. You will easily figure out repetitive movements for the different enemies that will make every fight a piece of cake. However, considering the age of this game one can't really blame the developers for that.All things considered I personally love this game and will replay it through the anniversary edition for sure. I can recommend this game to everyone who likes exploration, puzzles and adventures. It is a beautiful game worth the time you put into it.			"

												My favorite game of all time (along with Doom).  If you have never played this, you need to experience it.  This game has great music and atmosphere and fills you with a sense of wonder and adventure in a way that is unprecedented.  It was completely epic in its time, and it ranks right up there alongside classic Doom in my opinion.  Imagine Doom with environments that were a little more epic and explorable and some parkour/platform elements ala Tomb Raider.  That would be my favorite game of all time.Update: You need to download a program called Glidos if you want to experience this game with the best possible visual fidelity.  Also, as a side note, I recommend you checkout free TRLE custom levels if you are into classic Tomb Raider gaming.  Just look this stuff up on any search engine.  It will be worth your time.			"

												Tomb Raider was the first 'proper' video game I ever played (except on a Commodore 64). I have a deep and abiding affection for the first three Tomb Raider games. Playing them again does recreate something of that first love. I remember feeling that I was visiting the places depicted in these games. I have subsequently visited many of them in real life and felt as if I've been there before.For the youngsters of today the graphics are clunky and the controls unforgiving. I used to spend many a happy yet frustrating hour trying to line up the jumps. But for old people like me and for students of gaming history, this is a must.			"

												Other than some glitches that returned me to the desktop (one being while shooting a gun with Ctrl and hitting Esc at the same time) and the cinematic cutscenes rendered in such a way it would sometimes make viewing them difficult (probably the best they could do at the time of the games release), the game was great.  It is a wonderful adventure, exploration and platformer game.  The story is a little lacking and somewhat confusing.  I thought I would be noting the horrible controls since I had remembered Tomb Raider games having such horrible controls, but I didn't find them to bad once I learned what each button did.  I don't know what Tomb Raider game in my past gave me this problem, but it wasn't this one.  It was many years ago as well and my ability in games may have improved.  The music and sound is great, though there isn't a lot of music to go along with the game.  The graphics are very dated but that is to be expected.			"

												As most elderly folk will remember, Tomb Raider 1 was highly innovative when it was released. It's all all-time classic, considered a milestone in graphics and inventive gameplay, and helped shape the beloved tradition of starring eye-pleasing females in video games.Is it worth revisiting? Yes and no. The levels are incredibly repetitive; cave walls and temples are all you will see. You will spend hours dragging blocks and running back and forth between switches, ever finding little if any resistance from enemies. Also, are 4 different weapons really enough in our homicidal gaming world? You don't even get the uzis until the 12th level! The challenge lies in the unforgivable controls, where delayed jumping mechanics and treacherous distances make a two-headed monster you will come to respect, love and hate.I feel that rating this game above the sequel, Tomb Raider 2, would be based on sentiment rather than content, but that remains one guy's opinion. Even if it is a good one. In conclusion: the game is definitely worth replaying for those of us who had the chance to experience the golden era of PS1, but I would not recommend this game to a new player, even if they are into the franchise.Groke out!

												I love this game, but I won't try and pretend that it aged well. As with many 3D games of its time, the graphics look awful by today's standards. Thankfully there are mods to at least be able to run it at a higher resolution, but it's not going to make Lara Croft look any less blocky. The early Tomb Raider games developed by Core all have weird controls that will probably take some getting used to, but once you do, they're not too bad. Despite these flaws, it's still fun to solve puzzles and pump wild animals full of lead, which is why I still enjoy coming back to this game now and then. I've played through the first two levels so many times that I could probably write a book on them.If you're a long-time Tomb Raider fan, you don't need me to tell you to buy this. If you're a newer fan coming from the Crystal Dynamics games (such as the 2013 reboot), I'd say the original is at least worth trying to see how far the series has come in the last 20 years.			"

												When I first started up the first Tomb Raider, I looked at Lara's polygons, and I thought: wow, I should just uninstall this crap... I mean the voice acting in the first intro is so lame, and how the rich woman is trying to buy Lara with money, when she clearly isn't in it for the money... And then I almost ragequit because the controls seemed clunky, making me feel like I'm playing the first Prince of Persia (the DOS game), the main protagonist with a turn rate so huge that no LoL player  would be able to bear it, and it ran on DOSBox. Yet I managed to get through the first level, get frustrated on the second level because I couldn't find the key for the door, and I still kept playing. This is a good game because it gives player an adventure, not just mindless shooting (although mindless shooting still helps to kill the wolves and smaller raptors). This game has exploration and you need to look for items that are hard to find (there are many secret item spots), but you also have to avoid traps, be quick and careful at the same time.			"

												Tomb Raider I: Lara ""Don't sweat it kitten"" CroftIt's been exactly 20 years since adventures of the second most famous tomb-digger have started. Lara Croft is hired by a wealthy woman to find 3 pieces of an ancient pendant. Along the way, she encounters strange discoveries, led-filled betrayals and terrifying enemies, leading her to unravel a great mystery that was supposed to remain in the past.Even today this game is amazing: levels are interesting and challenging, Lara's movement is detail-rich and precise and puzzles are well-though and rewarding. the first TR plays more like an action version of chess, where every movement and jumping must be precise, and the player must progress slowly and with a plan ahead. PC version of the game, without patches or mods, has no in-game music, but that only strengthens the atmosphere of exploration and trepidation while you encounter the next challenge.While the graphics are simple by today's standards, they do their job well in portraying the feel of Hollywood adventure movies. Lara's movement however is great, with an emphasis on small details as she moves and fights. The combat is on the other hand slow and clunky, and it has not aged that well as the other aspects of the game have.The story has a great setup, but as it develops, it remains shallow and short. Design of the main antagonists is great though, still inspiring that same sense of dread, repulsion and other-worldliness. The pinnacles of artistic design are the last two levels that feel amazing and strange at the same time.Tomb Raider is a great game despite its flaws and age and all would-be archaeologists with a lasso and a dusty fedora owe to themselves to play it. Two thumbs up!!			"

												As the very first game I ever played at 4 years of age, this is such a blast from the past! I can now have Tomb Raider on the go without my PSOne! The graphics seem to have been, albeit slightly, improved and the game has been sped up a little to make the running and shooting far less tiresome. However, the music does not play in most areas of the game and later on in the last few levels it plays a constant wind howling sound. However, I will still recommend this game and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have! On to Tomb Raider II!			"

If your first console was PS2 or later, go buy the remake of this - you'll have a much better time!			"

												IntroI know what you're thinking.  Damn, man, this thing is ugly.  Yeah, the low-poly models and low-res textures are a bit hard on the eyes.  I admit it.  But everything else is in such good order that you will very quickly be fully immersed.  The visuals will melt away and what you'll be left with is one of the most fantastic adventures in gaming history.  Bar none.ProsThe Tomb Raider franchise almost certainly requires no introduction and this first game in the series is, in my opinion, its best.  When gaming made its transition from 2D to 3D and from cartridges to optical media, Tomb Raider took astounding advantage of both.  The adventure is a sprawling epic that gifts players with a good many hours of challenging gameplay.  The environments are interesting and varied.  The puzzles and object hunts meld well with their contexts and level objectives.  The plot is fairly well developed and the dialogue is appropriately cheeseball.  The music and ambient sound, however, are extraordinary, even by today's standards.  Among the very best I have ever heard, period.ConsThe only criticism I would make of Tomb Raider - and it is very rarely a hinderance to enjoyable gameplay - is that the camera is a little wonky when Lara is in tight quarters.  This can make pathfinding a little rough on occasion.  Other than that and the understandably dated 3D graphics, however, the game is, to me, practically flawless.SetupLike a good many old school games here on Steam, Tomb Raider is delivered as a DosBox configuration, fully packaged and ready to go.  The team even went through the trouble of including a Glide emulator with the game, allowing the enhanced 3DFX graphics engine to provide a 640x480 resolution and mipmapping.  I strenuously recommend upgrading this to the very accessible nGlide by a fellow called Zeus.

												This is the most highly conditional ""Yes"" I've ever given a game on Steam. This review also applies to Tomb Raiders II through IV, and probably V and VI as well though I haven't played them yet.There isn't much to say about this game. The graphics are clearly something to sneeze at, and the audio is nearly nonexistant. There is no plot to speak of, and there isn't much variety in mechanics. The entire meat of this game is through the gameplay.Tomb Raider I has some pretty solid gameplay, but this is only true when we recognize that the game was released in 1996.  The movements, while extremely clunky, give you a wide range of mobility options for each scenario. In terms of how this game is meant to be played, it is unlike any other game I've played before: instead of emphasizing reflexes, strategy, or problem solving, this game test the player's dedication and perception. You are tasked with exploring many different landscapes where all of the textures look very similar, and this game pushes this test of perception to an extreme. This game is not for the feint of heart, and I certainly did not enjoy it very much.So why do I recommend it at all? Because I believe that it would be a very enjoyable experience in a group setting. If you have a team of people all soaking in your surroundings, you are much more likely to progress in the game, and find the crucial secrets that help you get extra medpacks. You can laugh at the corniness together, or maybe even try to progress through a level with everyone drunk. I believe that this would make a great game for a small friend group where everyone likes to experience new types of video games. The reason I did not enjoy the game when I played through it was because I was playing it alone, and heavily relied on a walkthrough so I wouldn't keep dying. But if you have some friends like on Game Grumps e.g., you can probably power through this game pretty quickly (and maybe have a walkthrough open just in case you guys get stuck as well).If you haven't played a Tomb Raider game before, this might be worth picking up. Play it with friends.			"

												Tomb Raider 1996 - ReviewIt’s hard to know how to review this game, if you hold it up to modern standards then of course it’s got more than its fair share of issues. But if you take it for what it is and compare it to games at the time it is one of the best games ever made.At the time of its release we has seen nothing like this, the graphics on both pc and console where fantastic and the game play and level design where fluid and expansive. It really did blow allot of people away. I won’t go into too much detail regarding Lara's history or legacy as we all know the impact she had on the video game industry as well as pop culture its self. So let’s begin.Tomb Raider puts you in the boots of arceologist Lara Croft who is approached by a rich and powerful business woman known as Natla to recover an artefact in Peru, and that is all that is know when Lara sets off on this adventure. The story on the whole is decent but It can be hard at times to piece together exactly what’s going on, I guess in modern gaming we are so used to incredible cinematic experiences that a handful of short FMV's and in game cut sense don’t quite cut it. The clues are there however and its a decent story that keeps the game moving on nicely. The game itself see's Lara tackle 4 areas that are broken up into 3 to 4 levels each, these are Peru, Greece, Egypt and finally Atlantis. The level design for the time is incredible and really second to none, its the classic Tomb Raider design of platforming, key/switch finding and occasional animal or boss battles but for the time is was fresh and exciting. My Only gripe with the levels is that each areas levels can feel repetitive from a graphical point of view, even though the layout of these levels are vastly different they use allot of the same styles and textures.From a graphics and sound stand point, for a 1996 game it looks and sounds great. 3D environments bring the world together and Lara’s character model looks good if not a little.....pointy. Only issues are a poor draw distance which can be quite jarring in 2016 and sounds sometimes don’t play when they are supposed too however this is an issue in both PC and console versions of the game. The levels don’t have a soundtrack as such, but more occasional sound bites as you adventure, or sounds play to symbolise and secret being discovered or door opening. Sounds of Lara's movements, gun fire and other NPC's are all good for 1996. Some character models of other humans could be improved however as the difference between them and Lara in quality is quite obvious.The game play is what we have all come to know, love and find frustrating. It’s the usual fair of run, jump, roll, dodge and shoot. There is allot more emphasis on platforming in Tomb Raider as opposed to the other games in the series and only a few enemies appear in levels. To be honest in 2016 Lara did not feel as ""tank"" like as I thought she might but it can be a challenge to move her around. More often than not I died because she did not jump when I wanted her too or due to the dated graphics a ledge was not as close as I thought. This was frustraiting in 1996 and is frustraiting in 2016 so be warned before you play. It did however not stop my overall enjoyment of the game and replaying it 20 years after it first came out was a complete joy. The PC version also bennifits from its ability to save wherever you like mid level, PlayStation and Saturn versions of the game had to make use of save cristals scattared thoughout the levels and this became more than a slight annoyance on the consoles.Over all Tomb Raider is a fantastic game, it blew us away in 1996 and in 2016 it’s not as hard to play as I thought it would be. The story is solid and helps move things forward nicely and the overall presentation for the time of release is top notch. This is all complemented with fantastic level design if not slightly aesthetically repetitive. On a modern PC with windows 10 the games runs well, only issues I had is FMV's stretch to fit the screen which can make them harder to watch and there is also a slight delay between them starting and playing on screen only a second or two but this really does not detract too much. Overall Tomb Raider is an all time great that will go down as a classic. - 9.2/10 - PC     9.0/10 - PS1/Saturn			"

												Simply the best. For all those who complain about keyboard settings, the original tomb raider didn't had any key customization system, and this is a really good port, if you like me have already played with the original '96 version.If you find yourself in trouble with key mappings, you can change them with dosbox mapper (I managed to use the Xbox 360 controller), but don't just put useless negative votes. This port is EXCELLENT!			"

												I'll skip the whole novel-stating-why-I-♥♥♥♥ing-love-Tomb-Raider, and instead give you just a brief rundown of what you should expect from Tomb Raider I.Backstory: Tomb Raider was a PS1 launch title that BLEW UP because of how amazing it was- no joke. Lara Croft became infamous for her ""triangle ♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" because her breasts were mere triangles instead of the round jiggly thingies we have today. Tomb Raider is an ongoing franchise that features Lara Croft as the protagonist who either struggles to survive, or go on a massive search for some artifact. Storyline: You are Lara Croft- a world known archeologist on a search for something called ""The Scion"" which a mysterious person named ""Natla"" has informed you about. Lara Croft is a bad♥♥♥♥♥ dual pistol wielding girl who lives for adventure.Gameplay: Okay, now you have to take into account that this game was made in 1996- a PS1 launch title to be fair, so the gameplay functionality is going to be on-par with these next generation titles. Tomb Raider is a 3D platform-adventure game with gun mechanics that actually work. Tomb Raider also integrates puzzles into this platforming-adventure experience, so not only do you have a compelling story, but also a great genre scheme. Sound: Since this is an outdated game, the sound effects can come out quite poor at some times due to the lower files not being supported by newer tech. If you have high teir headphones, you will know what i'm talking about. Graphics: I keep going back to the topic of it being from the 90s, but it's true and it's age really puts a show on it's graphics, sounds, and just gameplay in general. The textures can be a bit bad and look unrendered to it's full potential at times, but it still works and looks... ok.. for it's time. Lots of elements found on the ground are sprites including the pickups like health packs, ammo packs, and artifacts. Overall, it's not TOO BAD, but it's nowhere as good as the sequals. Conclusion: If you haven't found out already- Tomb Raider is AMAZING. If you have not played it, what is wrong with you? Stop reading this, scroll up, and click ""Add to Cart"".			"

												I never really thought about writing a review for Tomb Raider until I saw the Steam awards.Tomb Raider for me is a solid nominee for the ""Test of Time"" award.  Despite its age (exactly 20 years at the time of writing this review) it's still a great game to play!The lovely OST tunes, the action, the mystery, the anticipation and the atmosphere are some of the main straingths of this great work of art.This is by far my favoutite Tomb Raider game in the whole series because of the lonesome feeling it gives you, it's mostly just you out there solving puzzles in historic and mythical locations while facing wild creatures (and rarely humans) on quest to unveil the secrets of ancient world civilizations.If you're into solving puzzles and diving into different mysterious ancient worlds, then Tomb Raider is a must have in your library!

Unfortunatly, it does not come with perfect controller support, but if your willing there are ways. you can simply edit the files to make your controller of choice work,     Along with the issue with the windows button causing the game to crash once you try to go back to Tomb Raider; this too is easily corrected with a quick edit.

												Tomb Raider was the first game I owned for PS1 and it took me a long time to finish but I'm back for more.  Still, this is a great game and fun after all these years.  The game uses DOS Box, which crashes from time to time.  Not a deal breaker, because it never happens to me during gameplay only when I'm trying to get back into windows.  I still have not found an easy way to play Tomb Raider in windowed mode.  You have 16 ""save anywhere"" files.  This save mechanic makes the game so much better, as getting back to an area that is hard to get through, only to end up jumping and falling to your death for the 20th time gets old fast.  Save anywhere is much appreciated.  You can use it a lot or not much at all, which is awesome either way.As for game controls, I am using a ""SNES like"" iBuffalo Classic usb Gamepad, Serial number A504510 with the JoyToKey gamepad free software for key mapping. This is the only way I could get the shoulder, start, and select buttons to work.The game just didn't feel right using the keyboard.  I only use the keyboard for menus now.Hope this was helpful.  Keep on gaming. "

												Great game! It is always nice to go back to the classics and remember how all of this amazing series of games started. This is basicly what the whole game is about:At a hotel in present day Calcutta, Lara Croft is approached by an American named Larson Conway, who works for the wealthy businesswoman Jacqueline Natla, owner of Natla Technologies. At Natla's request, Lara sets out on an expedition to recover a mysterious artefact called the Scion from the lost tomb of Qualopec, in the mountains of Peru. After successfully retrieving the object, she is attacked by Larson who attempts to claim it. She beats him then questions him, learning that the artefact she has is only a fragment and that a man named Pierre Dupont has been hired by Natla to collect the rest.Lara breaks into Natla Technologies to find out Pierre's whereabouts. She discovers a medieval monk's journal, which reveals the depths of an ancient monastery of St. Francis in Greece to house the tomb of Tihocan, a ruler of Atlantis, along with a second piece of the Scion. Traveling to the monastery, Lara descends through an expansive underground complex, pursued and attacked throughout by Pierre Dupont. At the tomb of Tihocan, Lara recovers the second piece of the Scion and finally kills Pierre. An inscription inside the tomb states that Tihocan was ""one of the two just rulers"" of Atlantis.When Lara joins the two pieces of the Scion, she receives a vision of the three Atlantean rulers and their respective pieces of the Scion. One of them utilises it to create a mutant breed, but the other two confront her, and take her piece of the Scion. Then Atlantis is struck by a fireball from the skies, and the three pieces of the Scion become scattered as the civilisation is destroyed. One of them goes to Egypt, Lara's next destination.Lara travels to the City of Khamoon, a temple complex in Egypt that houses the final fragment. Here she battles the fierce mutants seen in her vision, and is once again confronted by Larson, this time in a battle to the death. She then takes the final piece of the Scion from the underground sanctuary. Upon leaving the tomb, she is ambushed by Natla and her henchmen, who steal the three artefacts and nearly kill her.Having escaped, Lara stows away on their boat, which takes her to a remote island where mining operations of Natla Technologies have partially exposed the Great Pyramid of Atlantis. After making her way through the mines dispatching Natla's goons and the mutant-infested interior of Atlantis, Lara reaches the heart of the pyramid chamber, where the complete Scion has been fused together as a source of power. Touching it, Lara receives another vision, where Natla is revealed as the previously seen third ruler of Atlantis. She betrays her co-rulers by abusing the power of the Scion for genetic experimentation, and as punishment is locked in a stasis cell by Qualopec and Tihocan, her resting place until the prologue of the game.Natla enters the chamber and confronts Lara; having reclaimed the artifacts, she attempts to restore her former power with an army of mutants. Lara attempts to shoot the scion, Natla tackles her through the observation window. Natla falls into a crevasse, but Lara manages to land on the breeding platform, confronting Natla's largest mutant abomination. After defeating the monstrosity, she destroys the scion and attempts to escape the collapsing pyramid. As she makes her way out she meets Natla a final time, now mutated and winged. After beating her, Lara flees the island just as the place is destroyed.			"

												The Classic Tomb Raider games are a breed that have died out, for better or for worse. For that, Tomb Raider is a different kind of game than most others that has it's niche. The best points for a recommendation are the games enjoyable atmosphere and lack of direction. The environments are open with no true goal, which for many can kill the experience, however traveling around dangerous and precarious tombs in the search for the unknown can be very satifying to many. The controls are cumbersome and might cause for the game to be needless precise, but it could be rewarding once you really get a grasp on your environments and positioning.The story sort of difficult to comprehend, not to mention awkwardly presented. Some of the characters are enjoyable (Particularly Lara) but they're mostly cartoonish in goofy ways. Combat is very basic and monotonous, I'd argue it's the least involving part of the game. This is not a direct port of the PS1 version, so you may want to look into mods if you want more music cues and the expansion pack that was released. If you're into quieter, slow-paced games, I'd recommend this, but if clunky-controls, dated graphics, (expected for the time) no direction, and subpar combat all sound like too many bad things to justify the time put in, then stay away.

												I love this game, and that's an understatement. It was the first 3D game that I'd ever played, and it's still one of my favorites to this day! The tone of the game keeps you tense while feeling both ominous and splendid when encountering new areas. Like others have said, few games capture the charm and solitary immersion that this game achieves! Made before a time when playing online with others and achievments were a thing, you can really lose yourself in this adventure with nothing in the game to interrupt, instruct, remind, or otherwise nag you. I really wish more games were like this nowadays. :(The biggest downsides to owning this game on steam are the lack of xinput support for this game and the fact that there is none of the iconic music in the game! However, at least the music part can be extracted from the pc version and put into your Steamapps Tomb Raider files, which works flawlessly after that. I haven't figured out if there's a way to enable Xbox/Steam controller support (joytokey?) but I find this game casual enough to use a keyboard with it just fine, especially since you can set your own keys and save in-game unlimitedly.

												This is definitely a classic! If you play Tomb Raider (2013) and Rise of the Tomb Raider, this is a must play. Might be it is not as beautiful or challanging as the above mentioned, but you can't say, you have played Tomb Raider, without having played the first ones.			"

												The very first PC game I ever bought back in the day. The giant T-Rex made my heart stop.And even the training level has more charm than Tomb Raider 2013.Still this game has it's old quirks that transported over from 1996. For today's standards the controlls are terrible (You may want to remove the Windows Key from the keyboard or live with the consequences). Also this is the DOS-Box port of the PC version. Meaning that a bunch of extra music that was added to the PS1 Version is not in this game.7/10 Good old Triangle Boobs.			"

												Tomb Raider was always one of my cherished games of my childhood, and playing this really brought some memories back.   Unfortunatly, it does not come with perfect controller support, but if your willing there are ways. you can simply edit the files to make your controller of choice work,     Along with the issue with the windows button causing the game to crash once you try to go back to Tomb Raider; this too is easily corrected with a quick edit.  Great game, but does require some effort to get an enjoyable proper experience.			"

												Holds up surprisingly well, managing to hold my attention when it really didn't when I first played the PS1 version in 1997. The controls make much more sense here than the controller, but they're still pretty crap. It actually uses the Numpad a fair ammount, so you'll be really aware this is a PC game from 1996. It's running on DOS Box. Egh. But it's authentic-ish, at least.There's no autosave feature. You fall off at the wrong time, you lose progress. I stopped at that point, but it was a fairly nice nostalgia trip, and I was pleasantly surprised that the game is a lot better than what I remember as a whiny 8 year old.			"

												You really can't beat the classics, especially with Tomb Raider. This is one of my favourite games ever, and one of the first I remember playing back in the 90s on a second-hand chipped ps1. It has fun exploration, puzzles, enemies, and your mistakes really punish you! You cannot backtrack, so you have to get those secret items on the go, sometimes you only get one shot! Missed jumps to death can ruin an hour of work! The PC version is kinder though, and lets you save anywhere which makes things considerably easier. If you like a challenge, try the no-med pack run or only saving at the old playstation locations.I would note though, that I have experienced crashes, though not often. And you are getting dated graphics and controls, but get over it, kid. It's a fun game! It's old, but remains wonderful. I continue to enjoy playing even after all this time, I still get nervous walking up to the bridge with the old T-rex coming out!			"

												Good game, didn't run on my lower end computer though. It runs pretty smooth, and the steam controller does make the controls easier. The only thing I would watch out for is trying to shoot, jump, and move at the same time. That button combination (Ctrl, Alt, & an arrow key) is also the combination that just so happens to turn your screen upside down..... I definitey had some interesting fighting experiences lol.			"

												20 years old and still an awesome gane.... if you can get past the archaic controls. Tomb Raider Anniversary edition might be a better overall game but nostalgia and the fact so many other games of its time modelled themselves off of this game just makes me still reccomend the original. Besides, the T-Rex in this version still looks awesome.			"

												When I was a child I LOVED and admired Lara.I wanted to be just like her: beautiful, strong, independent, (with a lil' more boobies x°D). To me she was the most important ""person"" in the whole world!I played ALL of the games for Playstation for hours and hours without getting tired. When I saw the whole collection here on Steam, I couldn't NOT buy them! The only let down was the completely absent Controller Support. Please, Steam, fix this as soon as possible! Playing this kind of game on keyboard it's near the impossible (at least for me) and, anyway, Tomb Raider was mostly meant to be played on PS.			"

												Well, this is a very-very old game, more than 20 years old. But somehow, I still enjoyed it. The movement was clunky and frustrating to control, and the enemies were a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It was a challange, and I felt relieved after completing it. But the atmosphere and the music was great, and searching for resources and secrets was awesome! It built a good foundation for the rest of the series.  Nice game overall! :) And I also completed the Unfinished Business levels, those were hard as ♥♥♥♥! :D			"

												I'll keep it simple. This is one of the most well made games of the playstation era. It has the perfect balance of difficulty while keeping you interested in continuing. I finished this on my console (hence the 7 minutes played on PC) and you'll be surprised how well this competes with modern games in terms of raw game design. Yes, the tank controls take awhile to get used to - but once you do,  you may actually find yourself liking it. It gives a good focus on platforming over action. Action isn't what Tomb Raider is supposed to be. Instead, you'll be challenged with all sorts of clever puzzles and tricky platforming with the action parts being a side dish. As a fan of the original franchise, I really despised the modern Tomb Raider games. I'm sticking with my guns when I say that these oldie originals beat the new ones right out of the water. If you give this game a fair piece of mind, it'll deliver for sure.			"

												Ok, as you can notice I've only played 3.2 hours. This is half true, since I spent 2 or more hours getting the damn thing to work as well as my controller but honestly it was because of my dual monitor setup so I had to go into the config files (dosbox conf) and change the res to 1024x768 This is because the max res is 4:3 so no 1680x1050 for me D:. Anyways at first I thought this game was garbage after. I tried using joytokey but since it didn't work for me I had to copy and paste someones xbox controller settings. The game at first seemed to control like a slippery wet beach ball until I learned that walking and adjusting yourself with the strafe are KEY ELEMENTS to this game. When I learned how to actually control the thing I finally realized that the controls are another part of the difficulty. If it were easier, then the game would be so much easier. No sarcasm, the controls remind me of dark souls where buttons must be pressed very fast and in order in order to do things like jump attack and jump in general. Speaking of jumping you're going to be doing a lot of it and it is almost always better to jump then move than the opposite because lara jumps when her foot hits the ground. This again adds more difficulty. All in all I think I'm going to enjoy the rest of lara, it seems to be filled with good puzzles and enemies.			"

												It can’t be said that Lara Crofts first outing has aged very well as next to its peers from the time the game, quite frankly, looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ But then, Tomb Raider did turn the action adventure genre on its head. There was no fixed path to follow, instead there were different ways you could approach a problem, secrets to seek out and dynamic puzzles to solve like no one had seen in a video game before, and all this in complete third person 3D. For what Tomb Raider lost in graphic fidelity and some control issues it more than made up for in it gave to the history of gaming. Not to mention the fact that Tomb Raider was revolutionary for having a strong female character in an Indiana Jonesesc role. For all its perceived bad points and the fact it has aged about as well milk on a hot day, Tomb Raider remains a classic that can be cited as the beginning of the third person action adventure genre as it exists today and I don’t care what anyone says it is magnitudes better than it’s 2007 remake.Full review below if you want to check it out:

												What is there left to say? The original Tomb Raider is a classic game.Just as 3D games were coming of age, and as other game developers were focused mainly on developing the FPS genre, Tomb Raider made a 3D statement about puzzles, platforms, imaginative maps, and ancient booby traps! There's even a story with cutscenes! Yes there is a bit of shooting involved (and some tense moments!), but the game is all about exploration, discovery, and plenty of parkour. Need I mention that Lara Croft broke barriers by being the best female game protagonist since Ms. Pacman? The graphics have of course dated (jn fact they're so blocky that they're almost on par with Minecraft!), and the controls are a bit clunky and take some getting used to.... but ignore all of that. Once in a while, the environment will open up to reveal an amazing temple or work of art, complete with suitable ambient sound and you'll be taken aback.The level design is spot on - which is one thing that the developers CORE were experts at. Indeed there's a lot of imagination that goes into the level design as well. As with any adventure game, you might get a little bit stuck trying to solve the puzzles, but they're none too hard that you end up in frustration. At certain moments you'll have an epiphany on how to solve your problem, or perhaps you'll spy a secret tunnel that leads to a secret area!Tomb Raider was a tour-de-force in level design and anyone who calls themself a gamer, or a game level designer, needs to play this.Just mind Lara Croft's booby traps.
