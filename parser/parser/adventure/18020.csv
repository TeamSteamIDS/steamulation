AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode Two Original Release: 2008 Genre Tags: RPG; Adventure; Parody; Comedy My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Casual gamers REVIEWOn the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode Two is not as challenging as the first game, but it continues the narrative and tradition of the first. It boasts solidly designed and enjoyable RPG elements, with a light and hilarious story.  This is a good pick-up for any casual RPG fans out there looking for some lighthearted fun.Like the first game, technically, this is a parody game— but to be honest it plays better than many modern “real” RPGs that are emerging from the indie realm.  It plays like an old-school, turnbased-combat RPG, complete with leveling-up elements and a mild form of gear upgrading.  The gameplay is definitely fun and the RPG elements will keep you addicted to the progression.  You will find yourself striving to reach that next milestone of development as you play through the hilarious campaign.On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode Two is a Penny Arcade game. The story is fun and funny; it doesn’t take itself too seriously.  It is very lighthearted and the game is packed with hilarious and immature humor.  The characters are likeable, and cartoonish.  The art style is charming and fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly.  It all comes together as a very comic-like production.This is a good second chapter to the first game.  There is really nothing drastically different in this one compared to the first, but that’s not really a bad thing because the first was pretty good.  As they say: “if it ain’t broke…”I strongly recommend playing both Episode One and Episode Two in order and together, as they are more two parts to a whole than they are two separate games.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												This is part two of the 4 episodal game series. NOTE: NOT A GAME FOR CHILDREN, I PERSONALLY WOULD RATE THIS GAME ""A"" FOR ADULTS. Now for the game. I highly recommend playing the 1st game before you do this as the storylines will make more sense. IF you do have the fist game, the character you made will automatically be found and can be used in this game. Again, funny situations and silly bosses are quite common in this game. Again, like the 1st game, rpg battles and comic book like scenes between fights.Recommended game for sillyness and humour, just like the 1st game of the series..			"

												Glad they didn't ♥♥♥♥ up a lot in the sequel.The episode 2 it's pretty much the same as episode one, still lot of fun, same combat sistem but with different weapons. 'Cause the protagonist get bored of rakes and start hitting robots 'n crazy men with a hoe. Yup.Same charming characters, same great art style, same great and yet ridiculously funny story as the first episode.There is only one thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off in the gameplay: the boring yet easy  brain mini-game . Impossible to skip because a main story mission, good only to waste time and make the game look 30 minutes much longer.Final Score: 7,5/10Except that, the whole game is really fun, I think I said that too many times. Get this one too if you want to play the whole series!..That now it's like the very first Final Fantasy style. Oh well, it's still nice to me.			"

												I love this game.  However, the developer's work ethic was weak and it shows.  Besides abandoning the series unfinished, leaving it for a different developer that mixed things up a little too much, they abandoned fixing the bugs on the Mac verision and instead removed it from the store.  Now Mac users have paid money for nothing, because the game won't even start.			"

												The second episode of Precipice of Darkness is a continuation of the original game and should be bought bundled with the first episode. Episode two doesn't offer any new modes of play, but still extends the fabled adventures of Tycho and Gabe along with your imported character from the first episode. If you enjoyed the first game, then episode two should be a no-brainer.			"

												A direct continuation of the first Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness with all that entails.  Gameplay is generally improved, it's WAY harder to accidentally gimp yourself, and the scale (and foreshadowing) ramps up nicely.  Plus, there are some truly hysterical sequences nestled up against the creepy stuff, and it's tight enough to not overstay its welcome.			"

												An even worse port than the first game, with less interesting locales and characters -- at least early on -- than Episode One. So why do I like it? The writing, of course, and the second half are both good.

												On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode Two picks up shortly after the events of the first game. Once again, you (your character from the first episode can be imported) team up with 1920's-era Gabe & Tycho to stop an apocolyptic menace. Everything I said in my recommendation of the first game once again holds here, because this is pretty much the exact same game - literally, it uses the same engine, combat, mechanics, style, etc. The only things that have changed are the locations and enemies. So just take my previous review, replace ""slaughtering hobos, clowns and mimes"" with ""slaughtering mental patients, pretentious rich folks and giant spiders"", and there ya go. But that's not to say there's anything wrong with this - it works in an episodic format. So once again, if you are a fan of PA (their humor or characters) and adventure-RPGs, this is worth a look, despite the rough edges. I'm now looking forward to the recently announced Episode Three!

												Tycho, Gabe, and you (yes YOU!) spring back into action, this time fighting the combined force of machine and black magick.With unique combat system, a rather traditional point-and-click gameplay, and of course more importantly: blunt, vulgar, and hilarious comedic dialogue that we all know and love. Totally recommended for Penny-Arcade lovers and also non-lovers, because those who don't like Penny-Arcade can just be ♥♥♥♥♥ to sleep by dickwolves.			"

												Loses a lot of the JRPG focus and seems to be conflicted with trying to be a point-and-click adventure game. Tedious pixel hunting quests, overly difficult QTE combat, and a boring story with little focus really kills the potential this game had. Although it continues off from the previous game (game mechanic and level-wise), you lose all your old skills for some reason. More frustration comes from a long fetch quest chain that rewards you with a jail cell. Combat is absurd with enemies getting mountains of health plus free ""interrupt"" heals, removing strategy from combat and requiring you to just pile everything onto one enemy at time. The last boss is a multi-part ""gimme"" fight, that ends in a lame adventure game last fight that requires no skill and cuts out your party.Overall this was really disappointing, boring and tedious. Just pick up the first one and pretend ep2 doesn't exist.			"

												The gang from Penny Arcade are back in this sequel. And as such, here's a review!Story- You return as your created character (if you wish) and in trying to rebuild your home after saving the world, Gabe and Tycho return (again destroying your house) and beg for your aid in their latest supernatural case. Again, you now travel around the city looking for a new place to live while saving the world from a tyranical (and fruit-horny robot god). Again, following the same gothic, lovecraftian style of comedy and horror, the story draws you into its world and its characters. But, as in the first game, it will only do so for a couple of hours before the credits roll. A-Graphics- The game is exactly the same as its predicessor. Nothing truly great but works well with what it's got. D+Sound- The voice actor for the narrator still does a terrific job and still has that dry wit. Music is recycled from the first game, not a bad thing but nothing really new either. C-Gameplay- Still needs a controller option and still suffers the same problems. The battles are similar but the mini games that powers up the special attacks are different, which is good. Not an improvement but switches things up a bit. COverall- I kinda got lazy with this review but really, it is a continuation of the first game so I really can't say anything new about it. It's fun, and I like the fact that you can transfer your created character from the first game. Also, it does keep you intrested in it and makes you want to see what happens in the next episode. So... buy it and enjoy. C			"

												Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness has a title that is immediately indicative of the brand of humour you'll find throughout. The writing in these games, courtesy of Penny Arcade writer Jerry Holkins, is everything you'd expect, but unfortunately you'll have to put up with a turn-based JRPG of sorts to see much of it. Ep2 is probably the weakest of all, as the jokes are no longer enough to make the combat tedium feel quite worth it.			"

It wasn't until the first fight that I started to not want to play anymore.  It wasn't the fight sceen and it wasn't the action.  That is where they started cussing.  The action started with the S word and then the F word got put in a couple of times.  I would love to go through the game without those words.  So unfortunaly I cannot recommend this.

												Episode 2 of On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness continues the eldritch adventures of Tycho, Gabe, and your character from the first episode in their quest to avert catastrophe at the hands of giant robots with an obscene attraction towards fruit. As expected, it follows most of the conventions established in the first game as far as adventuring and combat goes, with only a few minor changes in terms of item function and cast. Overall, a good game for anyone looking for an adventure of only a few hours or for those who enjoy the style and humor of the Penny Arcade webcomic.As of mid-2012 (around the time of Episode 3's release), numerous players on Windows 7 machines were reporting being unable to get past the games start menu. Although neither Hothead Games nor Steam Support were able to help assauge this problem, it ultimately proved to be solvable by running it in compatibility mode with Windows 95.			"

												Penny Arcade Adventures Episode One was a game that had some good elements, but ultimately felt soulless and boring. Penny Arcade Adventures Episode Two had the exact same elements and was able to craft a much better game out of what it was given. There was very little changed from Episode One to Episode Two, but what little was changed made all the difference in the world. Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness: Episode Two is basically everything the first game should have been. Despite the fact that it is far from a perfect title, I can still safely recommend Episode Two, and if you enjoyed Episode One, then you are in for even more of a treat with this game.Full Review Here http://www.gamefaqs.com/PC/952842-penny-arcade-adventures-episode-two/reviews/156947 "

												Plays exactly like the first episode, but I liked the story better--it felt like the writers had fun with it. Other than a few new enemy types, everything else was identical. My one dislike was the excessive use of vulgarity, most of which seemed unnecessary--enough to stand out as a negative. It just made me question who their target audience was for this product. All in all, it's an okay game, providing marginal entertainment value.			"

												As expected, the humour style is in sync with the first episode.The story was a bit longer in this one, and there were some interesting puzzles to solve.A bit better than the first one, but almost nearly the same in all aspects.7/10 "

												A zanny game and certainy a funny one.I am not much of a fan of the Penny arcade comics but to have fun with this game you dont need those.Gameplay is pretty elementary and certainly meant to be a more casual experience for players.I think just about anyone can love this game, so long as they are not afraid of robot monkeys.

												Together with the first episode ""Precipice of Darkness, Episode Two"" is one of the craziest, funniest and stylewise rarest games I have ever played. Of course this game doesn't take much time to play through since it is just a relatively small production and ""just an indie game"" but it still is worth getting, simply because of all the creativity (or insanity) the developers put into this.

												You can choose not to start playing the story of the game and you get an achievement for it. 10/10Loved the first episode and got nothing less from this one.Witty, stupid, fun. Item descriptions are even more ridiculous.More silly characters and enemies.And the graphics are even better, too!Thoroughly examine the binocerus testicles. Don't forget.			"

												More of the same from Episode One, like I said before... If you enjoy Penny Arcade you will enjoy the story put forth by this game. The art is what you would expect, and the combat is more complicated than your average rpg, tho still repetitive after a while. I was never bored however. 8/10			"

												Episode 2 of On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness continues the eldritch adventures of Tycho, Gabe, and your character from the first episode in their quest to avert catastrophe at the hands of giant robots with an obscene attraction towards fruit. As expected, it follows most of the conventions established in the first game as far as adventuring and combat goes, with only a few minor changes in terms of item function and cast. Overall, a good game for anyone looking for an adventure of only a few hours or for those who enjoy the style and humor of the Penny Arcade webcomic.As of mid-2012 (around the time of Episode 3's release), numerous players on Windows 7 machines were reporting being unable to get past the games start menu. Although neither Hothead Games nor Steam Support were able to help assauge this problem, it ultimately proved to be solvable by running it in compatibility mode with Windows 95.			"
