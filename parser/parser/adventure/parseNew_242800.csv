 Played this from start to finish  Unbiased Review After about more than a year since release, I decided to check this game out myself - to see whether the other reviewers might have been too harsh. Many of them played a few minutes and denounced it immediately. I have gone from start to finish. The game can safely be said to be 'complete', as in the developers won't add anything significant to better the experience. So why is this game so bad? A few facts: - 5 weapons available, where only 2 (wooden machete and M9 pistol) are actually used for most of the game- Crafting boils down to merely creating bandages, you can complete the entire game without crafting anything else- Crafting is limited to 7 items (8 in survival mode)- There are a total of 4 kinds of enemies, that pose virtually no threat whatsoever, due to inferior AI coding - The entire game can be completed in less than 4 hours- Shooting inanimate objects causes them to bleed- The single voice actor delivers his badly written lines in such way that you would quickly consider turning it off - A great deal of the game takes place in a temple area (The Maze), this area is riddled with instant death traps that are springed upon you for the obvious reason to infuriate the player and slow progress further into the temple- Level design makes frequent back-tracking unavoidable - in the maze it means constantly having to avoid the same traps over and over again- All enemies respawn after loading a save- Survival aspect in single player is negligable, due to readily available resources in all areas of the game- Your biggest threat will be the rock throwing monkeys and instant death traps- Animation quality is very low, this will be apparent from the very start of the game- No quicksave, despite the fact that frequent saving is absolutely mandatory- Most of the game mechanics rely on QTE's - bandaging takes about 20 seconds to completeA note on the added survival mode: A rather small section of the singleplayer map is isolated for you to 'survive as long as you can' - this entails running around in the day gathering food and crafting materials, then using a shelter to sleep at night. Due to the extremely barebones crafting system and the fact that everything is so easily obtainable, this experience does nothing to redeem the game whatsoever. If this kind of survival experience is desired, titles such as The Forest does this better in every aspect. So tl;dr  - if you're looking for a survival game, there are plenty of other superior titles available. This game hasn't been too harshly judged by others, it fails in every aspect of gameplay from start to finish. For the morbidly curious, this game is an exercise in self-torture - it's not conducive towards any lulz whatsoever.			"

												Developer marks negative reviews as 'Abusive', but this game is 'Abusive' itself. It abused me deeply.This game is broken beyond repair. Horrible. Just horrible.			"

												Do not buy this game, seriously don't do it. It is horrendous in every aspect, poor graphics, crappy story, poorly optimized, cluttered gui, and boring/bad gameplay. Do yourself a favor and spend money on a good game.			"

												Oh dear, poor Garry has gotten himself into quite a sticky situation! First, Garry the humble bush pilot had a bit of a mishap during a not-so routine transport job due to Yellowstone’s Mount Saint Helena erupting right as he passed over it, resulting in a crash landing in the middle of...The Amazon jungle? If that wasn’t bad enough, Garry now needs to endure countless lethal cannibalistic natives chasing after him all over the place, puzzles that’ll test your patience and game-breaking bugs that are as hilarious as they are frustrating. Let’s take a look at Garry’s Incident.So, here we have Day One: Garry’s Incident, Wild Games Studio’s brand new, first person, action-adventure survival game. You play as Garry, a pilot who just crashed into the jungle and soon realizes that, along with the aggressive and possibly very hungry natives, rock-flinging monkeys and badly animated panthers that will devour your heart without a second’s hesitation, there is also something else going on in this place. Something very strange. Something...alien.That’s basically the whole story summed up. Now that we have that out of the way, let’s look at the gameplay, shall we? So, Day One is, if anything, ambitious. It combines a lot of different gameplay mechanics in an attempt to stand out from the crowd. Though the description of the game might have you believe that this is some sort of open-world, free-roaming survival simulator like Minecraft or Don’t Starve, Day One is much more linear than that. You still have some freedom to move about the lush jungle environments as you scavenge for supplies and resources to stay alive, but this is definitely no sandbox game.Speaking of Minecraft, there are some comparisons to be made between it and Day One. In a somewhat similar fashion to Minecraft, you have a hunger meter that gradually depletes over time unless you find food via hunting, fishing or plucking fruit from bushes. Day One also has a similar crafting system, where you combine items you find and click a button to convert into new tools and other useful things. Though you can experiment with the system to craft items, you’ll also discover pieces of recipes as you explore the world. You’ll need to memorize these, because the game doesn’t log the recipe for you before you successfully craft an item on your own.The crafting itself is simplistic and the inventory menu is sub-par, making the crafting more tedious than it has to be. Click the crafting tab, then click the items you wish to use in the crafting process, hit “craft” and you might make something. Every time you craft something you need to go through the exact same quicktime event, over and over again. In fact, QTEs are very commonplace throughout the game and you’ll get annoyed by them faster than you would watching Daniel Tosh do stand-up “comedy”.Another issue with the crafting, that is also something that goes far deeper than that, is the fact that this and the hunger system are completely arbitrary. You will never really need to catch much food. In fact, you can stay alive on the random fruits you find around the world alone. This is in part due to the fact that the game only has a couple of hours’ worth of gameplay before you complete it. In other words, risking your life hunting panthers or combining dozens of random items in an attempt to make a fishing rod is absolutely pointless. You’ll never need to worry about finding water sources to drink from or refill your bottle for longer treks either. Just click C - the default “drink water at water source” button - and you can drink water directly. Anywhere. Yes, even if there is no water around.Now, the aforementioned is obviously a bug and not intentional. Bugs are something Day One has a lot of. A LOT. I’ll give the developers some credit: they’ve released about five hundred million patches by now, improving upon the abysmal performance issues players had at launch and many of the worst game-breaking bugs. But even with most of the worst bugs now fixed - hell, BECAUSE many of the bugs are now fixed - it’s just so obvious that the game sorely lacks quality gameplay.I mean, where do I even begin? Okay, let’s look past the bugs for a second. I’ve already mentioned how the crafting system is pointless. Beyond that, the game’s mandatory puzzles are incredibly tedious and often demand that you backtrack and search every single crevasse in the large environments to find that one thing that’ll let you continue.At one point, you’ll find yourself trapped inside an enormous maze of underground tunnels, where you need to pull switches in order to align some statues that opens up a gate, allowing you to escape. This simple task is arbitrarily stretched out and made incredibly frustrating by the fact that the switches are scattered around the maze far from one another, and finding them all is a pain because you only have a crude map painted on the rock walls to guide you. There are plenty of dead ends too. Sure, the various traps you’ll encounter are cool and somewhat challenging to master, but walking around for hours looking for switches gets tedious fast. This is not engaging puzzle-solving, people! It’s clearly just a cheap attempt to artificially pad out the game. In fact, the entire game suffers from this problem; you can spend a dozen hours completing this game that only has about three hours of actual gameplay and believe me, that’s not meant as a compliment here.The extensive list of mind-boggling design choices continues. The game employs a crude stealth system that allows you to sneak up on enemies and kill them in a single hit. However this system is also made pointless because you’ll find so much ammo for your two pistols that you can easily kill every enemy in the game without worrying about ever running out. What is the point of spending three minutes sneaking up on some native - or engaging in close combat with him that exposes the atrocious melee system with broken hit-registration and laughable animations - when you can just shoot him in the head and move on without risking your life? For a survival game, surviving isn’t all that hard. Well, for Garry, anyway. For you, as the player, it can be a tough test to endure the torment of this game.At least the game looks kind of okay. The graphics aren’t high-end or anything, but the jungles have a lot of foliage, making them feel lush and alive. It’s quite ambitious for such a small game. Animations, however, are not good. The world design is confusing and repetitive. You’ll also get stuck on objects or invisible walls all the time and you can clip through objects and even the ground. The sound design wobbles between mediocre and horrendous. Aiming your weapon feels sluggish. The inventory menu feels like it’s a pre-alpha placeholder. The QTEs are never-ending and...the list just goes on and on. Let’s cut it off here, shall we?I can sympathise with Garry Friedman. He’s in a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation. As was I, when I played this game. No matter how hard I tried to look for redeeming factors, I just couldn’t find any. When I finally reached the abrupt ending, I was disappointed that the game just wrapped up before it ever made use of any of its interesting mechanics and before it went anywhere with the story. But, at the same time, I was also happy that I was finally out of that hell. It’s obvious that the developers had a lot of ambitious ideas, but sadly the few mechanics that work are rendered pointless by the level design and the game-breaking bugs. Despite some glints of ambition here and there, even when ignoring the bugs, there isn’t anything here to warrant purchasing Day One: Garry’s Incident.			"

												I don't think I have ever made a worse purchase. Keep in mind, I have bought Shaq Fu, Duke Nukem Forever, and even though I  don't like Call of Duty I still bought them to try them out. BUT THIS! This is by far the worst game I've played. I understand that it's being worked on, but more work should have been done before being put up for purchase. The combat is broken, I have no clue what I'm doing or where I'm going, the puzzles that I do find are too easy. You can take damage if you fall from a height slightly higher than your jump. Your gun...is not a gun. Guns kill people when you shoot them and the bullet hits the person. Here, it just mildly annoys them. But you! Oh you die really easily. You can take damage even if your hurting the enemy. You'll see them react to getting hit, they look like they can't attack you, but you still get hurt somehow!The game is unplayable as it is. You get attack often giving you no time to heal and figure out what to do. Some could say this adds a chalenge, but I say if that is the case then it's an unfair one. I'm just glad that it has steam cards so I can get some of my money back.Somewhere under all of the bugs, glitches and poor design choices, there is a good game. A game that can live up to the description the game gives you (the reason I bought this game thinking it might be good) but right now, unless the develepor can get some help, this game is not going to go anywhere.

												The only reason I played this game was because that it was included in a bundle.Playing this game will give you a valuable lesson on project management, as Day One seems to be a comical case of a project gone awfully bad. From missing sound assets, really odd-looking rendering/lighting, and an overall vibe of ""I can't be bothered to finish this game"", Day One will leave you with an everlasting impression of emptiness, an idea that never became whole. I want to get off Garry's ride. Don't buy this game, even for laughs, the dev doesn't deserve it.			"

												With all the negative reviews, I just thought that I had to get the game to see what everyone was talking about. I honestly did not think a game worth more than one cent could be THAT bad. I was so proved wrong. This ""game"" is a disaster. I thought it would be fun to play a broken, glitchy, stupid game...I was wrong. This was the most anti-fun that I had in one hour. I can't quite say it was disapointing, because I already knew that it was going to be bad, but I still want to share my thoughts.Conclusion: This game either needs one of three things: (1) to be taken off of Steam, (2) to be made FREE, (3) to be SERIOUSLY updated.

												In all my years of gaming , this is the worst game I ever played,- Glitched out the map in the tutorial- Crosshair in the cut scenes- The options use the default programming name (BAllowD3D9MSAA)- Takes years until the game actually launches- The game icon is the udk icon- Crashed after the first cut scene- The AI is just...- When I thought it couldn't get any worse , it got way worse...Seriously , I can't even give this game 0/10 , it will insult all the games that are 0/10.Final words : Don't even buy it , if you recieve it as a gift , the best option is to decline , or to save it and send it to someone you hate (Someone you really hate).This game is seriously the worst game ever created , and will be create , I can't even imagine how someone can create a game worse than this or even equal to it , a game with 1 solid color background is even better than this game , because it won't make your PC crash.Anyone that played this game should get a medal , if you survived this game , you ready for the real life			"

												I played this game for 45 minutes and its honestly one of the worst experiences I've had when playing a game. I love playing ""bad"" video games, I find it fun but this one is just abysmal, because at least the other games I play it seemed like no effort was put in. While in Day One: Garry's Incident it actually seems like effort was put in some places but executed absolutlley horribly, I could go on about how bad this game is but instead of wasting your time, here is a list - - Crosshair during cutscenes.- No sound at all during cutscenes.- Dreadful atmosphere.- Awful music that loops.- Some of the worst sound effects I've ever heard in a game.- Really bad animations.- When you kill someone their body disappears immediatly.- The voice acting is hilariously bad.- Lots of long loading times.- And finally, when I tried to close the game it refused to.That's JUST from 45 minutes of me playing the game, imagine how bad the rest of it is, do NOT buy this game for the full price if you want to experience this game then buy it when its 90%+ off, it's not even worth it at that price to be honest.

												Short version:Prometheus, in eternal punishment, was chained to a rock where his liver was eaten daily by an eagle, only for it to be regenerated by night due to his immortality. This game feels exactly like that.Long version:PROS:-it ends, eventually, after having sucked the will to live out of you.-they never made a second episode.CONS:-buggy, very buggy...cutscenes making you stuck, teleporting you to beginning or worse, you die for getting stuck to scenery ,you die while walking, your health meter bugs out, mobs can still hit you even if the animations don't play, unfinished game menu, alt tabbing makes the floor disappear, also CTDs-graphics can look decent sometimes, but some parts have horrible models, also overall ugly textures-background sounds and some music can be acceptable, but Garry's voice, enemy grunts and animal voices are subpar and get old fast-story is almost non-existant, and what's there is either not explained or makes no sense whatsoever, also useless quest descriptions-horrible AI, horrible enemy placement (easy to get swarmed by 6 monkeys)-subpar controls, clunky, slow-ish, combat is basic and awfully animated, also I hope you enjoy having to go through a quicktime event every time you need to heal-awful instadeath traps, so many of them, paired with the awful controls it gets frustrating fast-bad level design, who knows where the levers you need are? also if you missed one, good luck going back to it passing the dozen or so instadeath traps-the survival part is useless, I only crafted bandages, that's all, you get tons of food and water anyway...and the thirst/hunger bars deplete so slowly that they're not an issue anyway-they never made a second episode, but they've managed to make another game, so yeah...there's that..Overall, stay away from this....I've only played through it as a dare, and it was awful.You deserve better than this, whoever you are.

												This game was fun at first, but overall it is pretty terrible.  There are some good puzzles but the game is horribly optimized and runs incredibly slowly on my machine while any other newer game (such as Bioshock Infinite) runs very well.  It was also full of nasty bugs, like never being able to pull a needed lever and pick up key items.  I got it on sale before it came out ($15 instead of $20) and I still feel like I overpaid/was ripped off.  The gameplay was very linear and the ""survival"" aspect ended up just being plain annoying/non existant.  I like to support indie games and I had some high hopes for this one, but I was sorely dissapointed...			"

Pros-Well, it starts!-Has a main menu!-Has some actual f***ing gameplay!Cons-Animation is worse than the worst 3D animation I've ever seen!-The plot made me go WTF!-Oh yeah, the lag! I got out of the temple and the FPS was like 0.000001!-Couldn't get any further because of this lag-But I've seen gameplay so let me tell you:-Crafting system is just... pointless. Who the hell needs to press a whole bunch of buttons to craft one thing!?-Invisible walls randomly popping in!!-Ridicolous AI! Can't even crawl under a trunk!-Occasionaly there's a crafting recipe ON A TREE, which is basically SOMETHING I CAN'T DEFINE                                                                                                              + SOMETHING I CAN'T DEFINE                                                                                                              + an actual item in the game                                                                                                             = A FISHING ROD-Weapon power too unrealistic and unbalanced; a machete is dreadful, sawed-off shotgun is sh*t compared to it. The hell?-Seemed like I wasn't even on the floor when I was in the temple! LIKE I was floating or some sh*t!!-Killed a panther, spawned somewhere else!!!-Fell through the floor for no damn reason!!  WASTED 4 EUROS ON THIS HORRIBLE SH*T!         Well, the refund system is available since... I dunno, but I know it was available when I bought this game, in July!Yo, the list goes on and on and on....But let me tell you, not even now, in october 2015, as I'm writing this, when an update came out in June (which basicallyupdated the food system instead of patching the game, what the hell?), not even now, two years later, isn't worth a shot.Don't look at the positive reviews, which are all actually full of sarcasm, so that means that this game has, in fact, 0% positivereviews! So, what will I say for the verdict? This ""game"" isn't a game. Shouldn't even qualify as one. This should be denied from existence, before someone kills themselves because of how rotten this is! This could get 10/10. If it was made back in f***ing stone age!!!!!!!!!!!You know what sucks? It's too new for the AVGN, that. Let's end this with generosity:0/10. Yes, even 0 is generous for this game. It truly is, if you don't agree, then whatever.			"

												This game, made me laugh. Absolutely horrid controls and movement, AI is worthless, animations are 20 years old, it looks bad, objectives are ridiculously hard to figure out, sound is terrible, crafting recipes are stupid, inventory is cluttered. I couldnt get past 20 minutes of it. DO NOT BUY IT, ANYONE WILL TELL YOU THIS			"

												Right.. So lets put a real one that isnt just rage spewing.When i first saw ""Day One"" i was excited, the trailer looked cool, i love survival games where you build the items you use, and it just looked awesome.In reality, it was nothing like. The controls are poor, sluggish, and just not good. The graphics are dated beyond belief, and the game itself is extremely buggy.After downloading it i first thought ""huh, it didnt say this was a ""game in production"", but it sure is as broken as one.. When i checked the store site i found it isnt one. The released game was barely playable and just all around bad. It never should have been released like this. It possibly never should have been released. If your considering, dont. The game just isnt worth it no matter the price. even with the free DLC. its so bad i havent even reinstalled it to try and play it.			"

												This game looks good in the store but once you actually install it and play it you realise why it has so many bad reviews.For a start the graphics are awful. I mean you would think a game released in late 2013 would look good. Especially when games like Skyrim were out in 2011 for christ sake! But no! This piece of crap decided to use horrible graphics!Then theres the story. It sucks! Basically you are a guy called Gary (No♥♥♥♥♥♥) and your plane crashes leaving you in a 'Mysterious' forest and you have to survive. And thats basically it as far as story goes, except for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about a dead familiy. Then of course theres the actual gameplay, you know seeing as this is supposed to be a game, basically its just your average survival game. Theres a crafting system (which sucks) , it lets you make stuff like medicine and bandages. You can find food to eat and drink water. You can interact wit locals by either killing them, trying to ignore them or do the occasional quest for them. Theres also weapons you can find. At the start you get a wooded stick, which for some strange reason is incredibly effective, later on you find an old timey double barreled pistol in a temple(WTF is it in a temple for?) and even later on you get a regular pistol, aside from that i dont know as i hated this game so much that i stopped playing it after that.  The ony other weapon i encountered was a magical one shot energy cannon that is permanently strapped to your wrist. Although its meant for destroying walls it can be used as a weapon. I personally loved the idea of this weapon but what i hated about it is that it only carries one shot and you practically never get to recharge it( which is done at altar thingies).The guns you get are ridicoulsly under-powered and pretty much useless, where as your stick is very effecttive. It can kill enemies pretty quickly and if you sneak up behind people you can do a pretty cool execution-style stealth attack which is one hit kill. What i hated were the enemies that i encountered. The most common enemies are natives and i kid you not, MONKIES!!!!! The navives are easy to kill as long as you use the afforementioned stealth attack but otherwise they are really hard to beat. The monkies are actually suprisingly difficult to kill considering what they are. They basically hide and throw rocks at you and if you don't find them they will kill you quite quickly, if you do find them they just run away and start throwing stones again. This brings me to another point, the natives will sometimes just ignore you but other times will completely randomly go ape♥♥♥♥♥♥and attack you. What i found most annoying about this is that if a monkey attacks you and you attack it it will sometimes run to a native who will then come and attack you, so you have to deal with two enemies at once! Overall i personally really hated this game and would not recommend it to anyone. This game tried hard to be fun but in the end it failed and just ended up a bad far cry clone.			"

Short version:Cons1. Everything.Pros1. Protagonist has a beard. I like love beards.Long version: Alright, so as you've seen from the reviews, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. I honestly bought this game because I thought I could find genuine interest for it, but I was so wrong. Even for $0.99, this game isn't worth it. This game literally is competing for bottom place with Bad Rats- it's THAT bad. Allow me to go into further detail-Music- There is little to none throughout this game. I started the game and noticed it from the get-go. There is a GIANT lack of music and it really ruins the mood for the game and ruins the playthrough for me because it's not nearly as dramatic as they wanted it to be. For instance, you'll start the game and soon after the temple you are in will start to collapse, but instead of crumbling noises from debris, it's just dead silence as you only hear you own footsteps. It's so lack luster and I think the game would be more enjoyable with more music in it. Frame rates- This game is just horrible with it. Max settings on a GTX 950 doesn't even manage to get 60 FPS when I'm outside that temple....thing....whatever it is.... It's just so horrible. Low settings still struggles to keep a steady framerate, especially when outside and combat is involved. Combat is also clunky as hell, but so are the frame rates. Heh. This game is just so unoptimized, like, it's not even funny. There have been several updates claiming to have ""optimized"" the game, but those patch notes are lies. These developers lied to my face by saying they optimized their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for my sexy hardware. Bottom line, the framerates are bad/borderline unbearable even if you have a gaming computer. Animations- Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the animations are HORRIBLE in this game. Animations really don't flow at all, for example, at the start of the game you're introduced to our character (actually, you aren't, he's just shown sitting in his chair with no introduction whatsoever) and he appears to be pulling a ""Max Payne"" and has drugs, beer, pills, etc around his desk. He then proceeds to pick up his beer bottle and he (I think) starts to bring it to his mouth, but ultimately fails and tips the bottle upside down (without spilling ANY beer) and putting it to his chin. No drinking sound effects or anything, he just sets the bottle down and the game transitions into the next place- which is what I'm going to talk about next.Transitions- my literal reaction to various transitions: ""Wait, what?""   ""Ummmmm, how does that even work?""  They're so out of place and don't work at all with the story line. Going back to that whole ""Beer bottle that he drinks from his chin"" part in the introduction, the transition to the next scene is absolutely hilarious. So, he's drinking (?) his bottle from his chin and he gets some sort of transmission from his radio and it mentions something about his warehouse. Soon after, the camera zooms into the window and then severely cuts to a random shot of our protagonist in a plane to which a volcano explodes- sending him hurdling towards the ground with a blown engine. Soon after the volcano explodes and he's hurdling towards the ground, a box in the back of the plane starts to glow a blue glow and it makes a portal to which Garry (the protagonist) goes through forcefully. This begins the storyline, where he wakes up in the middle of a forest; being dragged by some tribal natives to some place. He faints and wakes up again in a temple; hearing a native with a sword sing some ritual and plans on stabbing him for some sacrifice or something. THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO GET INTO, BECAUSE THIS STORY MAKES NO ♥♥♥♥ING SENCE AT ALL. So as you can see, the transitions make 0 (zero) sence. Conclusion- If you thought about buying this game- don't, please, save you money. Even if it's for $0.99, don't buy it. These developers don't need to be supported and get more money to make another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for us. Even if you're going to buy it ""for the lulz"" please, just please, help some starving kid in Africa instead. It's more beneficial than this cancerous game. Review is STILL accurate as of 3/25/2016 "

												I really enjoyed this game and it was really fun too....Are Wild Games Studios gone now?Ok, this game was a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It was a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kebab forged from the very depths of the sewers. This game also stamps on those who try to talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about it hence my clever review disguise, you see?I loaded up the game to be immediately greeted by a menu system that could only have been imagined by a man who'd have his testicles mounted on his wall, peering at them and polishing them at the weekends. I also noticed that this game also doesn't even have its own icon as it was still displaying the UDK icon for the game.Ok, let's crank up the graphics. This game still uses the default variable names in menus - bAllowHighTextureMaterials...REALLYI then started the game to find myself in a sacrificial chamber with the world's most oblivious temple priest of all time. I escaped from ropes that weren't even tied to anything to begin fighting him with a machete which I must of pulled out of my♥♥♥♥♥♥ I killed him and there was no death animation, he just fell over dead and vanished into thin air.I then started cutting down some lights and pushing buttons with my incredible arms that allow me to push buttons from a distance of 2 metres. Then for no explicable reason, the temple starts to crumble with broken rock meshes. I ran out of there and entered a cutscene which contained no sound at all.I followed a girl to a village and had to do a stupid fetch quest for animal meat. I went down the dirt path and saw a panther which activated possibly one of the worst QTE's I have ever come across in my entire life. I killed it and stole his meat. I brought the meat back and then stopped giving two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the missions.I continued the way I went before when I came across a pyramid. I climbed and there were many mirrors obviously placed for some kind of puzzle. I couldn't be asked and went back down the stairs again. Or atleast I would have if I hadn't died from fall damage by walking down the stairs. This showed me the death camera which would look like what I imagine a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fly's vision to be like. It was here I couldn't stand it any longer and quit.Buy this game when it is super-cheap. I am 100% serious, you have to see this♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's so apalling this game appeared to be more of a comedy!

												I made the horific mistake of buying this game when it first came out. i started playing it and well all was well for about an hour. Then i got to the point where there was enemys and then all hell broke loose. i had great FPS but the AI were effing impossible to kill. i died hundreds of times trying to kill 1 ai. Also the game was so ♥♥♥♥ing buggy that i would glitch out when i was in any kind of building. i could be point blank with an ai and not hit them with the sword. I thought this would all be fixed because well it was a new game at the time and normally they release big patches and stuff gets fixed. INSTEAD the devs were like f*** it lets release patches that mess up the game even more. About 3 patches later my game completly stopped working  like the game would crash on launch it would crash when i hit play. it wasnt fun and then the best part was that it deleted my save file. ALL hours i spent playing this game were wasted i lost that time in my life and it wasnt even good time spent. Great games such as any of the ARMA games rock and i dont mind playing it whatso ever. now there is ONE good thing about this game. the whole story of the game (the concept of gary flying his plane into a deserted island was cool) this game was more like a massivly suckier single player version of the tv series Lost. all in all this game should be pulled off of steam and please never buy this game. you will regret it.

												EDIT: BY FAR THE WORST GAME IN HISTORY. The game is not only bad, but the Developers try to silence anyone who tries to warn others. I've submitted several discussions on the official page, only to find them removed withing seconds. (Oh also I paid £15 for this, it is now as of 27/11/2016, 0.99p that says it all.)DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEWhat in essence is a brilliant idea, with some really great features like a crafting system (even if it is exremely limited), that enables you to make some neat tools and equipment such as: a shelter to sleep in, a fishing rod, and a water pouch for when you're feeling parched. I was very interested in trying out this game the concept is great; the final product, not so much.Unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst games I've ever played, the opening cutscene; the part that is meant to encapture the interest of the player is riddled with glitches. It begins with the protagonist blubbering like a baby to some guy who didn't know if he wanted to stand up or sit down, stand on the desk or stand IN the desk. I was willing to overlook the awful animation and unforgivable glithy-ness if the gameplay was at least half decent.But unfortunatley the gameplay turned out to be so dull that it makes smashing your face into a wall seem like entertainment. Don't be fooled by the trailer, the combat is... how can I put this... glitchy, no that's not it... terrible? Nope, that's not it either. I suppose the only real way to describe it would be ""S**T!"".  The game begins with the player being dragged off to some temple to be sacrificed by some locals who are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that your helicopter crash landed into their friends, killing EVERYONE involved (other that you of course), you are then thrown into the worst combat that I've ever seen in any game, ever. Enemies seem to be able to attack you even though they clearly have a bad case of advanced rigormortism, I thought that they were zombies at first but alas, no, it's just more awful animation.My advice is to save your money and play something else. At least until the developers can admit their mistakes and put some effort into making this game playable.			"

												""Day One: Garry's disastrous fail"" would be a more appropriate title for this abomination of a game. I have little to offer that probably hasn't been mentioned already, but I'd like to point out that I purchased this game for the sole purpose of experiencing the pure comedy on show, and I have to say it didn't disappoint me in that respect. So, what's on the menu with this comedy of errors then? Well, floating half-naked tribesman/woman, monkeys that appear to be on acid running aimlessly round and round in circles, cut-scenes that look 15 years old, voice acting that sounds like it was recorded by the most boring man on earth and combat so poor you'll actually laugh when you kill something. (trust me you will). One minute you're alive the next minute you're dead and often with no explantion at all as to why. Even if this game wasn't bug infested, it would still be fit only to cheer you up after a bad day at the office, because it will make you laugh at least, sadly for all the wrong reasons. So, why not buy this wonderful comedy and revel in its awfulness? On second thoughts... Don't, just don't. Good grief. 0.5/10			"

												Yay, I get to review this now!Firstly, I am a huge indie games supporter, but check out 


YouTube™ Video: This video is no longer available: The Day One Garry's Incident Incident 

			Views: 5,140,236		

			On the 18th of October, the developer of Day One Garry's Incident issued a copyright strike against my channel, effectively censoring the criticism of their game.		

 as to why these devs deserve all the smacks on their collective wrists they can get. Then check out their metacritic page (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/day-one-garrys-incident) and laugh along at its awesomeness. 0.5/10 average user score after 1548 reviews.Still, it came in the recent Bundle Stars indie game bundle, and surely can't be that bad right? Maybe just a victim of internet hate? And it has Steam trading cards, so it's pretty much me being paid to play it, right? Ha. Haha.Let's see. The graphics are absolutely awful, simple, low-rez, stock graphics pasted together, primitive character models are pretty much just going through the motions with no facial expressions and really crude, robotic animations. Corpses despawn immediately upon death, though the background corpses that are there are violently graphic.What little voice acting there is is dreadful, and really is just made up of short snippets (that often doesn't make total sense in the context - like ""Uh oh"" when you fail a crafting combination, even though you don't lose anything for it) set to trigger when certain events happen. It takes several hits to bludgeon enemies to death and in the meantime they don't sound very perturbed by it.The AI is deplorable, when you can shoot npcs from range and they often won't come for you as they slowly die, nor do any of their friends around them. You can even sneak right up behind an npc, shoot another one, and none of them will hear it. Even when charging right up to them, half the time they just stand there glitched and let you melee them to death.Crafting is senseless, and involves a boring little mini..game? No, not really, just a mini-animation-thing, with keys to press, that shows off exactly how poor and juvenile their animations are.The plot makes no sense, the starting video is incoherent (though the guy's utter lack of facial expression or reaction or voice as his plane is crashing is awesome), and there is no plausible explanation why things happen the way they do, like why that plasma weapon was sitting where it was or how the guy knows it's going to float up to attach to his arm or why/how he can still change weapons after that. NPCs will appear out of and walk through solid objects at will, the uneven screen shake during the starting escape portion will give you nausea, and you will find dumb bugs like how boxes during that escape portion can fall on your head and trap you inside their model without the game registering a death and forcing you to load or anything.Anyway I'm out of negative adjectives, except to say that the game is a pile of snivelporking frumpletops. This smells like a novice-level game programming class project that even for that level came out really badly, yet somehow got developed further after.Yet, you should get this game. Why? Because it makes every other game on your Steam list look better by association. In fact, maybe it belongs on my Game Collector showcase on my front profile page... hmm. But hey, don't feel too bad about it, devs, some game had to be the bottom of the barrel here at Steam. By submitting this game, you just ensured another game didn't have to be. Very charitable of you.			"

												The graphics resemble the first attempts of a 3D game on the PlayStation One system which allows the player to take an interesting journey back to when 3D games were challenging to see what things actually were. I love the way the hit detection is made so that when you think you are hitting it, it doesn't actually hit them, it adds so much mystery to the game! It's great the way that although it is a low resolution game, it lags like hell unless you are on a decent spec gaming computer! It prevents people that don't deserve this amazing game from playing it. I especially like the way that the game developer gave this game to me for free and told me to give it a good review and tell my friends to buy it :) So that's what I'm doing! If you are looking for a challenging game not for the actual challenge but the fact that the game handicaps the player, look no further! If you're looking for a game which is more dull than minesweeper, you've come to the right place! It is great to force your friends to play! The storyline is really unrealistic too which adds a ton to the immersion.Graphics - 10/10 (Very nostalgic of 3D games from 1998)Gameplay - 10/10 (Brilliantly challenging, may be almost impossible to play!!)Story - 10/10 (All the good parts of FarCry 3 removed to give you a nice nitty-gritty experience)Music 4/10 (It sets the tone and style of the game and has a long and various soundtrack [Not for me!!] )OVERALL A 10/10 WORST GAME EVER! MUST BUY!EDIT: So the game is now in the weeklong deals. That's fab, more people can experience the melted rainbow of a game that is Day One: Garry's Incidence. I am... happy... that Steam are behind this game and even went so far as to use it as a main game on their homepage. Steam would be making a mistake if they weren't endorsing this! Oh wait, no, the developer just bribed Steam to do it. Wow, that shows that the developer has the money and is therefore a great developer! I'm just going to go send him some money on PayPal. Oh and some advice to the dev: If you made physical copies of the game, then the game would be worth almost 20 times as much by the value of plastic in the case and ink in the instruction manual. Maybe Gamestop will sell it? Just a thought.			"

												Rating this game a 2 out of 10 is being generous. Everything about it feels low effort, this is substandard for what a hobbyist UE3 modder might come up with. The game is tiny. You can run the entire circumference of the game world in about 3 minutes. It's populated by 4 NPC types. You have angry red diaper tribesman, angry brown bra tribeswoman, angry poo flinging monkey, and angry black cat. The bandages are bugged, if you cancel them before they finish you are healed full anyway and they are not consumed, so the survival aspect is out the window. Your supplies are virtually unlimited. The weapons make absolutely no sense. Your 9mm autoloader and your cap and ball pistol both reload by gently rubbing them. The game is plagued by technical flaws. Nothing feels right, nothing looks right. It's hard to explain, but everything is WONKY. That is the only word for the combat and movement in this game. Performance is inconsistent at best. The game doesn't even support my native resolution of 1360x768 so I played it in a window. But above all else, the sound design is horrific. I just played with the whole game client muted. The game is better muted than with sound on, trust me. You will never hear anything worse in your life as long as you live than the sound design of Garry's Incident.			"

												I friended the developer and talked to him for a little bit. He gave me two keys for the game. Says he's working on a new ultimate project that is just as good as Day One. And I'm like ""Haven't you seen the reviews for Day One? Everyone hates it. He says that since the update more and more people have started to like it and that he has a steady revenue stream. Call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and tell him my experience playing his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Tell him how buggy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game was. He tries to call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and blames it on my PC. Then he unfriends and blocks me. He's told me some other stuff before he gave me the keys. That was months prior. He told me something about having like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dead end job because he took a 400,000$ bank loan for the game. I pointed this out to him and he just started babbling about how good of a job he had, basically being arrogant as ♥♥♥♥, then that was around the point he unfriended me.			"

												I'm a big fan of survival crafting games. That being said, this is not worth the buy. It's horrible gameplay, terrible character development, slow, and based on an idiotic foundation in the first place. They could have gone a good way with the game, but decided to drive it into the ocean instead. It's also belligerantly annoying. Playing the game without it muted will drive you to drink more than the main character, unless you're in a cut scene. (Those have no sound anyway.) Massive amount of glitches and crashes. It's just bad.			"

To readers: Due to steam can't accept more than one review per game, I'll write any review with: English - most Steam users' main language and Chinese - my native language, language will be set to English. Hope you understand, and thank you.In a word: Good for the idea, bad for a game.一句话：创意不错，游戏太渣。I buy this game for it's concept, the weird story, the nice crafting system I think, and open world. But after my installation, I found the game totally bad optmization, and... WHAT THE [Beep]ING MARLETT FONT ON THE WALL?? I can't enter scene 2 just bacause my laptop is not so good? So, I feel sad for this game, and the developer, very sad.之前购买这个游戏是看中了其创意和特别的故事，还有开放世界和我认为极好的加工系统。但装完了才发现，这游戏实在是优化太差，然后……墙上的Marlett字体的文字是怎么回事儿？然后……我竟然因为我本子太差进不了第二个场景！？这游戏和其开发者真的太令我伤心了。Pros / 优点Weird story, maybe interesting;  /  诡异到可能很有趣的故事；Nice crafting and item using.  /  不错的加工和物品使用方式。Cons / 缺点Bad optmization;  /  优化差；Weird bugs;  /  怪异的BUG；Perfunctory Marlett font on the wall(Sorry, I just can't appect it);  / 墙上那敷衍的Marlett字体……抱歉，我受不了；No more, sorry. Because I have't play too deep, this game just prevent me for this. :(  /  抱歉没有更多了，我玩的不多，因为这游戏根本没法让我继续下去。 :( "

												Absoloutley terrible game, the use of animations and game logic shows that the game developers here only want one thing, your money! The cutscenes and use of character/object animation is absoloutley horrific and i would not even reccomend this game if it was back in 2001.The game is massively riddled with bugs, one of the bugs that stopped me from playing the game, was the Physx bug after you finish the temple mission. This stops you from continuing further inside the games story and deeply saddens any player with the ringing of money waste.I was going to give it a 2/10 but i am afraid it does not even qualify for that considering the horrific price for a piece of S***, while now the developers are laughing at the amount of money that we the general public have thrown them.For that i give it a 1/10.

												I was given this game as a gift under the condition I play atleast 60 minutes of it. I've done my time and not a second more. I feel bad that somone else wasted money on this. But lets look at this constructively.Pros:Sometimes the game would fail to load the ground so at least it was interesting for a few minutes.The screen shakes so much in the temple I threw up and lost 2 pounds, meeting this weeks weight watchers goal.Every now and then the game would crash giving me a few moments of sweet release to reflect on my bad choice in friends.Cons:The aiming is off.Artifacts like crazy.Panthers appear out of literally nowhere.Making and applying a bandage is 5 seperate quick time events. Five.Monkeys. ♥♥♥♥ the Monkeys.Overall 1/10 - at least it opened, some of the time.			"

												This game is the jurassic park trespasser of modern gaming, It tries to bring something which hasn't been done very often and has some ambitious ideas which is why I wanted so hard to enjoy the game but it's just not fun. The crafting and survival system is about as in depth as farcry 3. The combat is terrible, guns don't sound anything like they should and melee is clumsy. Day one looks and plays like a game released 7 or 8 years ago. The story from the beginning cutscene is almost non existant, read the plot on the product page to have any idea what is going on. As for variety of enemies we have panthers, evil tribals and monkeys throwing rocks, avoiding spoilers there is on more type but nothing exciting. One problem that really needs to be adressed is tabbing back to steam and back in screws up the video in game had to restart every time. Really couldn't recommend getting this game no matter how hard i try to like it.			"

Posted: August 23, 2014
												The story so far...    My name is Garry, and I am a wise-cracking, lecherous alcoholic.  One day, whilst out flying my light airplane, a, er...I think it was a volcanic eruption or something...causes my plane to crash in an apparently uncharted - though presumably close to home - jungle.  I wake up from unconsciousness to find myself being dragged by ""savages""/cannibals/guys in fancy dress to an unknown destination.  I again fall unconscious and awaken once more to find myself tied down to a sacrificial altar, with some joker about to stab me in the heart with what I guess, given the circumstances, must qualify as a ""sacrificial"" knife.  Not tied down very WELL, fortunately, as I easily break my bonds, grab a weapon and enter into a brief but awkward (but swiftly victorious) ""combat"" with my would-be murderer.  There is a native girl nearby in chains...my character briefly ponders aloud in a Duke Nukem-esque voice whether he should save her - thereby perhaps further risking himself - or leave her to her fate.  I choose to split the difference, and murder her in cold blood with a swift slash of my knife.  Garry has no time for sentimentality, he has some serious drinking to get back to...but first, he must of course return to civilisation.      I begin to search around the huge temple area, and find two fruit-like objects on the ground...I attempt to pick them up.  Wondering why I do not seem to be having any success, I suddenly realise that they have been inside a BARREL all this time - or did the barrel just come crashing from out of the thin air above to magically envelop them?  It certainly seemed that way.  No bother.  Garry will not be hampered by any mere barrel, so he smashes it to smithereens and ""obtains"" the mangos.  The Gods can do their best to hide mangoes from Garry, but Garry laughs at the Gods and their petty whims...if Garry wants mangoes, so Garry shall HAVE mangoes.  And so I continue searching about the grand sacrificial hall, and find only a pair of double doors which not only refuse to open, but indeed refuse to even be acknowledged in any noticeable way, shape or form.  Just decorative, then.  So be it.  There must, however, be a way out of this wretched place, with its high ceiling and burning braziers and cleaved-in-two bodies casually scattered across the floor like so much spilled milk in a share-house full of slackers.    But what is this curious writing upon the walls?  No, not writing...cave drawings...telling me I must cut some chains on some suspended braziers in order to get two eyes to light up on an Easter Island-style stone head.  Of course!  Why had I not thought of this before!!  Foolish, stupid Garry.  Two broken chains later, another Easter Island refugee slides aside and a way out is revealed.  Garry can practically TASTE the freedom in the air!  We press on...    There is another savage up ahead, with his back fortunately turned to me.  I am informed by the on-screen gaming Gods that I can perform a sneak attack by pressing ""CTRL"" and edging forward, then pressing ""E"" when I reach my quarry.  I accomplish this, effortlessly but bloodily, by apparently placing my knife to the front of his throat and pushing inward (no ""slashing"" or ""slitting"" required).  Who are these strange men, with throats as soft as butter?  I have not the time to ponder, as I must press on as always...    A room, with three buttons with symbols on them.  There are large amounts of intricate ""writing"" on the walls about them.  A time-consuming puzzle, perhaps, for Garry to decipher?  No heed, I shall simply press the three buttons, left to right...SUCCESS!  No devious puzzle shall prove a hindrance to Garry.  And what is this?  A strange object has appeared on a nearby stone, near to where I have recently picked up a flintlock-style pistol.  It is a magical armband, which Garry - being no slouch, and having no need of trial nor error - is extremely quick to realise, so of course, he tries it on.  It glows with an ethereal energy!  A new weapon, it seems.  But no rest for the wicked, as the whole temple begins to crash down around Garry's feet!  But alas, I am too slow, and soon enough find myself trapped within a multitude of fallen stone blocks which, in spite of failing to kill me, have effectively trapped me to the point where I have no choice but to restart from the last save point.  Such is life.      The second time around, Garry manages to avoid being trapped or crushed by falling debris, and even manages to casually shoot a fleeing savage in the back as he, like Garry, can do little but helplessly run for dear life.  We emerge, at last, into the open air of the jungle!  Not home and hosed yet, Garry.  Indeed, it is only seconds later that, erm, SOMETHING occurs - there is some vague semblance of a scuffle, and now there seems to be a savage running away in front of us - ah!  The on-screen gaming Gods inform us that she has stolen Garry's all-important FLASK, and as Garry is quick to observe out aloud, he can get by without ""the women"" but he cannot survive without his regular alcohol intake.  The chase is on, then, to reclaim Garry's flask!  Fortunately, the savage leaves a highly visible trail of stardust we can follow, even when she runs out of our sight.  At some point she decides the game is up - Garry is clearly too much of a match for her - and she stops and turns, patiently awaiting the fate which must surely become all who dare come between Garry and his demon drink.  The dastardly pickpocket duly dies for her sins, without so much as a fight.  She knows what she has done is wrong.  This is what befalls all who do not embrace the moral purity of Capitalism and choose instead to run around in wildernesses wearing loincloths.  Bet she didn't even know what ""AFK"" means, the brutish savage.  No doubt she would be vote-kicked from a bout of Left 4 Dead 2 Versus within two flaps of a butterfly's wings.  But fear not, Garry is here now in the land of the savages, and he will cleanse them all with not only the might of his magical armband, but drive his point home with the boisterous cut, thrust and parry of a well-placed and witty one-liner.    But alas, it is here that we shall - for now, at least - end our tale of the wondrous adventures of Garry, lost in the land of the savages.  Is there more to come?  We shall have to wait and see if I could, in all honesty, be ♥♥♥♥ed.   Verdict: 4/10 (6 out of 10 for sheer amusement value; 2 out of 10 for actual game quality...averaging out to 4.  See, Garry's pretty good at math, too...)			"

												The exploding volcano and teleporting plane raised my initial interest, but it only lasted 20 minutes. I stopped playing after coming down from the 'pyramid' and getting oneshotted by one of the natives. The game definitely needs more polish.The jungle area seemed very confined, with lots of narrow paths surrounded by unpassable walls. I had flashbacks to the forest areas of Zeno Clash and the jungle area of Lands of Lore 2.The saving system is problematic - it doesn't fully record the state of the world. On game load, enemies seem to respawn (even set pieces), destructible obstacles are back, and the action sequence screen shake isn't there anymore. The loading times drained my patience since I was getting killed every minute.			"

												My thoughts go out to anyone who, for whatever reason, bought this thing at full price. After 1 hour playing Day One: Garry's Incident, I was overcome with a feeling of shame for ever giving any other game a bad review, because the reason for those just seem petty now in comparison.The game starts with a cutscene drenched in screen tearing even though vsync was enabled. I then find myself (as Garry) strapped to a stone altar of sorts in the second cutscene after which I must perform an action (mashing a button) to free myself before an awfully animated shaman ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sacrificially stabs me. During this whole scene there is absolutely no ingame sound, not even crickets. It's like they forgot to include the sound files related to that event in the game.After freeing myself and making that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animation meet its demise, I find this scantily clad indigenous babe chained next to the altar and I'm faced with the choice of either freeing or killing her. Being a gentleman (one who sports a blade in case things go sour anyways) I decide to let her go, but I'm using a gamepad and the controls I'm being shown onscreen keep switching randomly between keyboard and gamepad directions, so I end up having to guess what to press only to hear her whimper as I kill her accidentally. Now she's dead, oh welp. I hit her again because... because yes, and she blurts out the same cry. And again, and again, and again. Outstanding. From now on it can only get better.Now I'm wandering around the temple until I find a piece of cloth and get instructions to craft it into bandages. I do that, and then I place two bandages in the crafting window to see if I could further combine them, and that's when our Garry says it out loud: ""UH-OH!"" and the game just crashes, with an UDK failure pop-up on Windows and all. That was actually funny because it seemed like he had suddenly become sentient (with a touch of clairvoyance) to our out-of-game reality, and I would naturally have considered a feature like that a pro, had I not found after relaunching the game that Garry says that every time you try to combine un-craftable things. Disappointment.Voice acting is not something I'm picky about, but here it is a thing to behold. I feel however I lack the vocabulary to describe something like that, and that it would be like trying to transcribe the humour in someone else's stand-up comedy act through written word. YouTube is just around the corner if you're curious.Given the red wall of top rated negative reviews glaring at you from the front page of the game's store, where even the couple of positive reviews are either sarcastic or humorously and explicitly trying to not be flagged as 'innapropriate' by the dev (who seems to have tried to do that with no success), you'd have to be blind, stupid, masochistic or possess some real next-level avant-garde sense of irony to buy this game.But if like me you got this in a bundle (with other games that you wanted) for nearly nothing, you might feel compelled to let its trading cards drop at some point. When you do that I'd humbly suggest playing the game while you wait for the drops rather than just idling, just so you can experience first-hand what will likely be the most ludicrous attempt at a game that you've ever played. If not for science, then for the sheer comedic value. And unless you're much more easily amused than I, the comedic value will last about as long as it takes for the cards to drop, at which point it will be the right time to quit and uninstall this garbage.Not that I'm trying to tell you how to live or anything.

												I saw the totalbiscuit review and did not wish to drop any money into it afterwards. Then Bundle Stars just came out with a new bundle and this was one of the games in it. I decided to load it up and try it out first hand for myself. Maybe they patched some  of the bad away... They didn't.This game is a complete waste of money. I would not own it other than the fact that it was part of a bundle. The first 15min of the game were chalk full of sound issues. The combat is laughably simple and boring. The voice acting makes you want to bash your head in. I will never finish this game and I do not care what happens to poor Gary either...Save yourself some money unless it was part of some bundle, then save yourself the time and don't even bother installing it.

How can a monkey flinging feces at Garry kill him? Some really bada$$ ecoli I guess. This game came with a bundle and I did not purchase it for this game, I had already read how awful Day One: Garry's Incident was and thought that playing it would be a good laugh, it was.

												Worst game ever! After wasting 20€ and playing this laggy and glitchy game I finally managed to get to do clear the maze but the problem was that you had to push around 20 levers in the maze and then clear the maze and then continue the game and the bigest problem was that there wasn't even enough levers to push to continue the game. So I sended a message to the developers about how bad the game was and all the bugs and then I gave the game a final chance because I wasted so much money in it so I restarted the whole game and played it all over again but I couldn't do the lever thing in the maze even if I cleared the maze.

												Oh, what a wonderful game this is. NO! It's not, It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NOT! Don't you even dare think of getting one, just walk away. The Incident is a proper title for this pile of crap! Games is as bugged as swiss cheese is holey. e.g. You can't just crouch and go stealth on enemy because that motherf.... will just turn around and punch you in the middle of your forehead. Not enough? How can you explain a man/women/whatever it is stealing your ""FLASK"" that you didn't even know you have? I will add a dreadful QTE sequence during a ""fight"" with a panthera and enemies not knowing how to use stairs. That's just not acceptable. People at Wild Games Studio, you should be ashamed of yourselves, how could you release such a buggy game with no interesting mechanic what-so-ever? Because you think that players are idiots and will just get everything that uses word survival? crafting? NO! Players, just don't buy it, please, let these people, at Wild Games Studio know that they've made a horrible game that's not worth a penny. Don't buy, Just don't. Oh, and I love one more thing, I didn't know that ""Adjustable FOV"" should be even mentioned as a game key feature. I will just drop cards from this crap and throw it into a big black hole of misery.			"

												I'd heard about this game through TV Tropes and TotalBiscuit, so when I happened to get it as part of a bundle I decided to try it out.It certainly lives up to its reputation.See, this game uses a titanic amount of memory, which... limits its framerate somewhat.  Forget advancing through the story.  Forget survival challenges.  Hell, forget looking for amusing glitches.  Simply moving from point A to point B is an aggravating ordeal.I can deal with the abrupt instant kills, the gratuitous invisible walls, the overly simplistic stealth mechanics, and even those damned monkeys, but not when the framerate feels like my screen is grinding against my eyes.The worst part is that this could have been bad in a funny way.  Like, for example, one time I tried to shoot an enemy from atop a pyramid, but not only did an invisible wall block my shot, the ricochet killed me!  I still didn't have my last trading card, so I spent the next few minutes killing myself against that invisible wall, just to pass the time.  Unfortunately, if this game is ever brought a playable state, most of the more entertaining problems will probably be fixed as well.  Too bad.Anyway, don't buy this.  If you get it in a bundle, don't install it.  This game is painful to play.  Leave it be.			"

												I don't know how I wound up with Gary's Incident in my account, but it was there when browsing through my Steam library. I fired it up, interested in seeing if it was really as bad as . . . everyone -- literally every one . . . has ever said. After all, I tend to be a contrarian. Maybe it has some redeeming qualities.After playing for a bit, I can confirm that it does not. Everything about Gary's Incident feels like a very early iteration of a high school first time 3D UDK development project. If a young person came up to me and presented this to me as their creation, I would be highly impressed. Unfortunately, when I come to Steam, I expect professional-quality projects created by actual game developers -- even if independent. What I don't expect is someone's janky first-time project. Don't pay for this. If you get it for free, don't waste the bandwidth downloading it. Don't waste your time playing it. I am worse for having wasted precious moments of my life on this thing.			"

												This is honestly a terrible game. Watch youtubers review this game or pirate a copy to find out yourself because reviewing this game is in all honesty a waste of energy. The ONLY way for this game to actually be ""revived"" is if it got an absolutey massive update or if this game was taken down and it was restarted from scratch. If that were to happen then everyone who had already bought it of course needs a free copy of the new game. This game seems if it was worked on could be a good game.I will mention that when i shot at some statue after I walked up to it, it killed me -_-			"

												The artist(s?) is clearly the top member of the development team. As bad as most of the game is, at least the models for everything are high-poly enough to look pretty decent. Granted this doesn't work for any of the animals as they look as flat and devoid of any fur detail as your average PS1 game.Disregarding the now infamous events surrounding the game, expectations should be tempered considering it is an independent game title from a studio you've never heard of. Even then, it disappoints.You can do stealth kills on the amazon women... with the same death roar as the men you kill. You can kill every animal in the game with a single pistol bullet (even from the awful double barrel ""old pistol"") yet it takes 3 pistol rounds or 2 M9 rounds to kill a completely unarmored person. Nearly all interaction animations end up throwing the camera underground, zooming in the camera so much you can't see the animations, or having the model clip through the camera. Most crafting is trial and error as even when there are recipies oddly drawn on some rock, half the ingredients are ""helpfully"" displayed as scribbles. Granted all you ever need are bandages and the leather water jug anyway. Lighting is all sorts of wrong and broken... but then again it is an Unreal Engine 3 game.There was a $50k kickstarter for this game, which failed, and I think that explains the game. The kickstarter failed, so the developer probably just gave up and put the unfinished beta into Greenlight. With the absolute zero quality control there of course it got accepted. I hear all but one guy left the company some time after release, which explains the tiny insignificant update made two years after release.Also, optimization/performance is unacceptably poor. I may not have the toppest of the line rig, but an overclocked i5-3570k, GTX780 Lightning, and enough RAM to run a large server should not be struggling to keep above 30 while running Crysis 3 on Max hovers around 45-60 and keeps games with similar-yet-better graphical fidelity to this one like Dead Island and Far Cry 2 well above 100 FPS.

I would love to slap the golden negative infinity as my rating on this title but unfortunately I can't even consider this game a ""Title"" due to its lack of basic development.A common expression I have heard is ""The best part of hitting rock bottom, is there is only one way left, and thats up"", so how does Wild Games Studios actually manage to face plant through rock bottom?

												As I ventured into the poorly rendered jungle with only my pistol in hand, i was greeted by a vibrant parrot, I went to the parrot and shot it, in an attempt to gain its beauty but instead Garry feel to the floor obviously because the bullet bounced off the parrot and into my heart, angered by this strange occurance I minimized the game and went to play some Hearthstone, I tabbed back into the game to see the floor had disappeared and become see through.10/10 Would Recommend Hearthstone, Great game by Blizzard and not Day One: Garry's Incident which is always a plus.

												I was having a fair amount of fun. It reminded me of what a survival game might be like on the ps2. The pros are there and so are the cons.+Whatever the hell you find interesting about this game (if you like survival games you might like this)Cons: Where do I start-Bandages heals you when you're dying of dehydration (you never have to drink water if you have a bunch of bandages)-The only drinkable water source I could find was the one in the friendly camp-The only real challenge I could find was ""find a drinkable water source""-Gives you missions but doesn't tell you jack about how to complete them-The AI are idiots-The most dangerous thing in the game (a panther) can be killed by letting it jump on top of you and by pressing w. Instant kill, you're fine, it's deadThe reason why I can't recommend this game above all is because of a game breaking glitch that doesn't make any sense to me. When I tried drinking out of a water source my game froze for a couple seconds and I was teleported back to the temple you leave when you first start the game. All i had on me was the wooden sword you get at the beginning of the game. If something in the code caused this (if it's supposed to happen) then that's total bs and makes no sense. Thumbs down for a broken game, thumbs up for a decent concept of native jungle survival exploration,			"

												I wish I could find something redeemable to say about this game, and believe me I'm still searching for something...  The reality being this is a very buggy, very boring and ugly game, and charing $20 for it blows my mind.  I was mildly amped at first to try a FPS survival game, but it falls short in every way possible.I can overlook the clunky graphics.  I cannot however overlook the numerous invisible walls, the horrid and boring combat and at times frequent see-through-walls syndrome.  I also want to smash my keyboard every time some mundane action or task comes up and you are forced to do mind-numbing quick-key actions.  This game feels like it'd be at home on the Wii to purchase in the online store for $2.99, but do yourself a favor and definitely do not pick this up for $19.99.  Maybe wait until a massive sale and pick it up as a gag gift for someone you don't like that much on your friends list.			"

												I played this game for a little over an hour and a half and I really wanted to like it.  I kept making excuses for the stupid mechanics and having no idea why I was taking damage or why I could bump into a guard while sneaking up on them and they had no idea I had ran into them.  After all the frustration, I decided to come back to the store page to see if there were any updates listed or any dates on when it would come out of ""Early Access"" alpha or beta stage it was in.  Then I realized... this wasn't an early access game.  The developers actually think this is a finished production quality piece of work.  Wow.  That is sad.Collision detection doesn't work.  Damage seems to be broken.  Weapons are unbalanced.  The special weapons you see in the movie are basically one shot items for the most part because they have to be recharged and there is no recharger point.  The blue glowing magic rocks embedded in your arm weapon?  I got it... but I have no idea how to use it and it is not in the weapons list when I scroll through.  I saved the amazon queen only to have her stand up and immediately disappear which froze my screen.  I waited about 15 seconds and then I got control back and it told me that I had cooked some meat.  Uh... I was no where near a fire.This game has flaws and its flaws seem to have flaws.  There is potential here but even if all the mechanics were fixed, I still wouldn't want to play it for the inane voice overs that this guy spews.  Its like they wanted to be funny like the original Duke Nukem games but have no idea what funny is.Do not buy this game.			"

The combat plays out something like Morrowind only it doesn't base it on your skills but rather with you trying to hit an enemy that seems to turn invincible at times.

This game could have a great story with good gameplay and optimization. I don't know what was going wrong on the side of the developers to leave this good concept as a motherboard burning software. Garry's Incident is only a dollar on the sales but it is very sad this game doesn't worth for it. I really liked the concept. if there will be a less more good gameplay i would play it for hours.

												I really do want to enjoy this game but it is a finished unfinished product lacking content and bug fixes.  It truly is a horrible game and shouldn't be sold on the steam market, I don't like saying games are horrble as developers put time and money into  making it as best it can be. but this developer aims more at selling an unfinished product and grabbing as much cash he can. Edit: Game was recently undated so it would appear on the front page of steam, what a shady business tactic.			"

												So I recently purchased Day One Garrys Incident and I liked it at first. The way you pull out the weapon randomly at the beginning was awseme. I went through and saw the monkeys which are awsemely textured with blue eyes and they through their phesus at you. The damage system is amazing also, when ever i go up to panthers and pet them and all they do is growl for no reason as I survive the incident. I really like it also how I see the UDK symbol because who needs a graphic designest. Was his name Garry and he accidently forgot to do the icon and that was his incident. I do like the loading screen with the magic box that has purple crap comming out of it. Its like ufhdsilddnsjlidsjilfnh uijdhs. And I really enjoy the textures that just spam crap your screen when you press alt and tab. It reminds me of the year 1982 when I played the best game of the year, E.T for the atari 2600, dude you talk about game of the year edition. It reminds me of that because all those copies were barried in a ditch and never seen again. Like this game, it should be barried because they are both great games of the year and were preserved in the ground because they were soooooo good that no one could ever witness the horror of the games! My friend also enjoyed this game, he said ""lulz i luv it m8 i gve it 8/8"", by the way my friend is lorenzo and has ALD and is deaf blind and can move his hands. So all in all, I love this game because the only way you can enjoy it is if you are on PTSD and having Heisenberg blue quality stuff and being mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.     :) Excellent game 8/8P.S lulz you ar a wizard harry, watch as i mke dis coment dishaper bcause its honst.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding Chocolate-Caramel Cream Pie recipe you've come to the right place.IngredientsAll-purpose flour, for surfaceChocolate pie crust1/2 cup sugar1/4 cup cornstarch3/4 teaspoon salt2 1/2 cups whole milk4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (preferably 61 to 70 percent cacao), finely chopped4 large egg yolks1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract2 cups Whipped cream2 tablespoons caramel1 thick block bittersweet chocolate, room temperature, for garnishDirections1. On a lightly floured work surface, roll pate sucree to 1/8-inch thickness. Fit into a 9-inch pie dish. Trim edges, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Tuck overhang under dough so edges are flush with rim, and crimp edges. Lightly prick bottom of dough with a fork. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line dough with parchment, and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until edges begin to look dry, 20 to 22 minutes. Carefully remove weights and parchment. Bake until crust is darker around edges and bottom looks dry, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack. (Chocolate crust can be stored overnight.)3. Whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a small bowl. Heat milk and chocolate in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until chocolate melts.4. Whisk 1 cup hot milk mixture into sugar mixture until smooth. Whisk milk-sugar mixture into the remaining milk mixture in the saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until bubbling and thick, 4 to 5 minutes total (about 2 minutes after it comes to a boil).5. Whisk yolks in a medium bowl until combined. Pour in milk mixture in a slow, steady stream, whisking until completely incorporated. Return mixture to saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it just begins to bubble, 1 to 2 minutes.6. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla. Let custard cool in saucepan on a wire rack, whisking occasionally, for about 10 minutes.7. Pour custard into chocolate crust. Press plastic wrap directly on surface of custard. Refrigerate until custard filling is chilled and firm, at least 4 hours (or overnight).8. Gently fold caramel into whipped cream, then spread the caramel whipped cream over pie. Using a vegetable peeler, scrape chocolate block at a 45-degree angle to make a small mound of shavings, and sprinkle over whipped cream. Serve immediately, or refrigerate and serve within 2 hours.TipThe caramel mixture must be very cold before the whipped cream is folded in. Otherwise, the whipped cream will collapse.Hope you like the new one :) not lemon anymore			"

												This game is unfinished, unpolished and though it has nice ideas it isn't worth the money in its current state!The Reviews on the Steam page were promising and it was on discount so I bought this game. It didn't say Early-Acces, it was sold as finished work. What I got is a game that feels tremendously UNFINISHED! The animations are artificial, I have seen better graphics in Far Cry(2004!). The sound is cheap and so is the voice acting. The graphics use a lot of performance and heat up the system. The menu overlay is quirky, slow and unresponsive. The combat system is dull. You can kill one of the friendly NPCs and noone notices or get hostile. Everything looks like they stopped developing half way.I'm willing to accept minor quirks when the concept is good and when it was developed thoroughly. But for the price of around 20€ the quality has to be a lot higher. And sadly they failed with this game and I feel like I wasted my money on this.			"

												I have a strange taste. I love to play bad games. Why? I don't know. Maybe because I like frustrating old-school challenges, I don't know.But This game... Just crossed the line. I have to say, and I'm not joking: this is the WORST game I ever played in my life so far (Big rigs bad!).It's really a shame because it has a lot of potencial, good ideas, but everything in it is terribly executed. The graphics are problably the best part of it, and they are already bad... it's terribly optmized, the controls are rigid and completely broken, the story is a mess and the presentation looks like it was made by a 3 years-old kid, the animations will make you laugh of so bad it is, inexistent AI, and the combat... just, wow... saying its terrible is being nice with it... And obviously is full of bugs, glitches that will make you get stuck in the game, etc.Just, don't even buy this crap, it doesn't worth a cent.

A much better, underated game that is an actual survival horror and will actually scare the crap out of you. PS. you can't blow up the pyramid. It's totally false advertising. I've tried. Not even if you beat the game. It doesn't even give you the option to upgrade it to blow up the pyramid so it is just blatant false advertising. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Use money for more productive things like pencils or helping orphans.			"

												Do not buy this game. I repeat, DO NOT buy this game! It will keep you captivated for hours on end and nothing else will be important to you any more - not your friends, not your family, not work, hell, not even eating or sleeping! The story line is thrilling - I mean, an alcoholic pilot transporting magical artifacts over the Yellowstone Caldera which happens to erupt with no warning and then being teleported to an Amazonian temple? GENIUS! Give the storywriter a medal! Oh, and the bugs are just to die for! Both of my saves are bugged so badly that they are unplayable, one where I am stuck underground and the other where I fall repeatedly through the world and die on spawn - and I'm only 5 minutes in! The bugs add an additional challenge that will entertain and excite all gamers, casual and hardcore alike! Oh, and the nostalgic graphics that take you back to the early 90's? Absolutely wonderful, it's almost as if the developers knew what we were craving for!! Meanwhile, the death animations are faultless - dropping with no elegance and disappearing almost immediately off the face of the Earth. Let's be honest, nobody wants to see a corpse lying around and nor do they need an over the top, dramatic ragdoll effect when you end a poor fools miserable life. You must be thinking 'I must buy this, what more could these Gods amongst men possibly provide us?'. Well, Don't get me started on the acting! Seriously, how these guys haven't cracked Hollywood is beyond me! The same monotonous tone is used throughout, whether it is making a comment whilst slaughtering a poor, innocent captive or stubbing your toe on the floor as you pass through it to an untimely, buggy doom. This familiarity is a necessity in the gaming world, allowing you to know exactly who you are still without breaking out of the captivating immersion!Oh, and did I mention that the game also allows you time to reflect on it's own brilliance in the form of lag and over the top loading times, even with a £1000 well specced PC? Just a little extra given to us by the amazing Wild Games Studio!0/10 Would buy!			"

NosebleedsTo many bugs in startup. To many workarounds to get the game running, not even a decent pre-setup to do some finetuning on the game. All this reminds me of games made in the 90s when most setups weren't required since everybody either owned a CGA, EGA, VGA or SVGA card. And there were only Adlib and Soundblaster cards for sound.Well, at those times you got at least a game running even IF your Ram wasn't high enough, you could do finetuning with some kind of memory manager. In this game you are first greeted by... Locked Display error, after you solved this little trouble you get to know the slow flash mode of the game, alternating between black screen and desktop - with no normal way to interrupt the game but to restart the computer. After you have solved this problem, you see a screen and video with some glitches (No, I have two computers one with integrated graphics and the other with a high end graphics adapter - it's the same with both).So recomendations? What for? For a game which might have been a good game if the programmer worked on a broader basis and didn't try to enforce their own narrow side of game design? For a game full of bugs, glitches and frustrating workarounds? Steam would do a good thing to remove their approval and remove the trading cards on this game. Supporting a narrow set of boards and configurations is always a bad thing. This game would get zero points out of ten for bad conduct. Prospects and after release debugging aren't a good way to start, especially when the prospects don't come even close to the expectations one held for a game.			"

Now go out of the temple and find T POSING NATIVES COMING AT YOU AND TAKING YOUR FLASHLIGHT. That right gave me nightmares, and a really good laugh.- NPCs | T-posing, Temple natives who have made contact with some outside persons since every village is filled with some type of flintlock pistol or a glock or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ yet they come at you yelling in wierd mono-tone banshee screeches with there low-res spears or machetes- QTE (Quick Time Events) | If you know this game sucks but you felt opptimistic about it then by now when you reach your first QTE that you wasted money. Most likely a panther came out you in the first Village and the panther has no sound, not a growl or the sound of it walking. And I think a panther wouldn't wait for you to press a button or make an action before it ripped your skin off and ate ever peice of meat on your ripped max payne body.Overall, 2/10Only good thing is that if you want to find a bad game to make fun of and look at how ♥♥♥♥ed up everthing is...

												worst game i have ever spent $2 on i wouldnt reccomend this game to anyone it took over 10 mins to figure out how to go past the first crack in the wall. i kept getting stuck in walls and only way to get throguh them was use a bandage then i would somehow go right through the wall. this game is a huge copy and is a huge waste of money i hope the devs learn that it is time to shut the game down or create a new one. i want my money back asap as this was a huge waste of $2 i hope buys this money grabber.

												This game is absolutely terrible, It doesn't telll you anything really apart from 'do this' but im not going to tell you how. It also runs like a pile of S*** as well as looks like a pile of S***Honestly I only got 20fps in some places even with all the highest settings off and I have a Radeon HD 7950 which can run most games at ultra settings in 1080p at 30+fps. Do NOT BUY THIS, it's not worth the 99p I paid for it let alone £14.99			"

												A survival game with crafting options sounds great, huh? That's what I thought when I saw it.Let me sum this up:1. Graphics are creepy and even with a good computer the game runs slowly.2. The fight system... ehm, don't wanna talk about it.3. The animations remind me of ""Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall"". On the first look it's a great game, but it's not worth your money. Almost 19 € for this game is profiteering. I bought it for 1 € from an authorised steam-key reseller and I regret it.Please dear developer, this game has so much potential. Fix the points shown above and it's gonna be a great game.			"

												This game could be good, but it is not.  And sadly its not an early access or beta so there seems to be little hope in it get less rough around the edges.  I don't mind the dated graphics, but rather the broken/incomplete feeling that persists in the game.  The survival and crafting being so hot of a commidity right now means that skipping this game is probably the best solution.  Thankfully not much lost financially or time wise as I have been curious about it for some time.  Cheap♥♥♥♥♥bundles save the day once again.			"

I grabbed this on super sale, but even the laughter and running commentary I was making about how awful this piece of ♥♥♥♥e is wasn't enough to feel like I got my money's worth. Craptacular graphics, terrible voice acting, crafting was what I had hoped would be an interesting mechanic but it was rather yawn worthy. Perhaps if I played it longer I could find something worthwhile, but judging by the other reviews... not likely. Run. RUN NOW.			"

												I went into this game having forgotten everything about it when it was launched. It started off promising with no sound effects until the first guy was dead. After which, he vanished. I then found a captive lady who I promptly killed, and continued to make the same horrific death sound about 10 minutes afterwards. The instructions on the walls were very subtle, so much so I spent a long time in the first area because I was captivated, I mean lost.After I had managed to get out of the first room after the huge stone structure slid across the room like it was on ice, I managed to escape the temple. I then had my flask stolen, and was promptly instructed to follow the glittery path the thief left. When they stopped, I shot her. To which I was prompted with a static version of the model...and my flask back. Kill the entire village (all of which made feral sounds when they died). One shot a panther....to die from a monkey because it was funny as running around flinging what I can only assume was poo at me. Death by poo is not fun by the way.When trying to remember what about  this game seemed so familiar, I remembered that a few youtube commentors had reviewed it and got the book thrown at them because of it. I can't understand why, because they were telling the cold hard truth. This game feels and looks like it was built by a single todler. Half the menus get this weird yellow box around it which stops the rest of it from working, the controls feel like I have my hand up Garry's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and controlling him through his rectom. The combat is poor, the ""special effects"" look like they came from 2001...and this was built on the Unreal 3 engine. An engine which has been used many times to produce beautiful games. I didn't even think it was possible to ♥♥♥♥ up a game this badly since that DayZ rip off.....wait a minute.In closing, this review is something you should read before buying, or playing this horrendous game. I bought this in a bundle of 6 or so other games for about $4AUD, and even then I feel ripped off. After writing this, I'm going to promptly take the hard-drive it is installed on and burn it, as there is no other way to remove that vast amount of♥♥♥♥♥♥off an electronic device.P.S. If the developer is reading this, don't censor this and remove it. I paid hard earned cents and I'm allowed to voice my opinion and facts on this game. I couldn't give a monkey's toss (hehehe) if you don't like it. I would rather save some poor kid his pocket money than have this game be sold.P.P.S I've had ♥♥♥♥♥ that have been more pleasent and larger replay value than this game..and I can't bring myself to finish this.

												Filled with bugs, messy gameplay, terrible AI, and generally just a confusing, and generally unineteresting, experience. I had no drive to move forward, and no understanding of what was going on. This game is not worth $20. It is not worth $5, even. It's worth, at most, $3, if you just want it so you can give it to someone you hate as a gift. It is truly terrible. The only good thing I can say about this game, is that it had a rather interesting idea, and it's a shame they completely mangled it into this. Do not get this game. Just don't.			"

												The game is still dropping the keybindings for controls, making it unplayable STILL!I have to reinstall the config files from the original download, redo ALL the setup, and can play for less then 5 minutes before it drops the keybindings again - rinse & repeat.Forget about any incentives to buy like the $100+ dollars in steam games contests.If you can't play the game you can't win the contest.The forums have people talking about completing the game (Usually in under 6 hours) and I'd like to know how they kept it from crashing for 6 hours.Don't waste your money on this tragedy.If your really interested in this game, wait a year then check the games forums.If you find more ""how do I complete this mission/objective"" then ""how do I run this game"", ""It crashed again"",""I want my money back"" then it MIGHT be stable enough to try.

												I cannot even begin to describe how terrible this game is. I am glad I paid next to nothing for it. The gameplay is almost unbareable. The graphic are seriously awfulThe combat system is worthless The difficulty is super jackedThere are next to no tooltips, you start off the game almost being expected to know what to doThe objectives are extemely hard, and also hard to even figure out. Took me almost an hour to figure out how to make a fire. Also, the storyline sucks hardcore. You don't even have a hint on what is going on or anything. You have a package then you crash and find a ""alien"" artifact and then get dropped in the forest. Nothing is explained. Ever. Maybe it gets clear, but no way I am going to find time to figure that out.I am giving it a 3/10 tops. Although, if someone took this game and jacked it up to current gaming standards, I think it would have HUGE promise			"

												I'm getting dizzy just by looking at the title of the game in my library. I'm literally in a near-puke state, at any time i can puke all over my PC, and I'm not even joking. The graphics are HORRIBLE, it caused me eye cancer several times while playing. There are lag issues. The textures are buggy as hell. What more can I say? OHHH. QTEs. The worst kind of. There are so many quick time events, that it's just irritating. For example, when healing, drinking, when getting attacked by a ♥♥♥♥ing panther every single time and so on. The crafting is okay, not too bad, not too good. The AI is messed up. Sometimes enemies charge at you from 3000 miles away, and sometimes they are just standing there, with their beautiful glowing blue eyes. Oh, not forget to mention, the sneak-system is not working, they will always find and attack you. There are 3 types of enemies if i'm correct: the natives, the ♥♥♥♥ing monkeys, the humoncoulous' (they appear on trading cards), and waaaay too many traps, which are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to avoid(especially the axe). It isn't survival-horror. It's only survival-horror for you, because this game is so damn broken on many-many levels. It's like the movie Ring, but in this case, playing the game will surely cause you cancer, leukemia, AIDS, and death, all at once. The story is dumb, maybe i'm stupid or something, but I just can't understand the plot. You are flying all over the place, when suddenly a big BANG, a volcano erupts, and your plane is going down becasue of a plasma hellgate, or i don't what is it. And you have that blue stuff on your plane. I don't know what it is, it's just confusing. Alright, so you landed, and you wake up in a temple with a bone sword or something like that, it's just useless. The enemies will kill you faster, and oh, the blocking is broken too. Sometimes it's effective, sometimes not. There are 3 levels if I remember correctly, and the ♥♥♥♥ing maze is the most frustrating part, when you have to move head statues. That map is filled with traps, like swinging axes, which are the hardest part to avoid, because the hitbox of the axe is too big, there are falling floors,  spears coming out of walls, and wall spike thingies. I've played this game for 3 frustraing hours, because i wanted to see the poor ending. And well, well, I was right. There was no ending at all, some alien ships came by, and just a ""to be countined"" screen. PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE SEQUEL. God knows how many poor souls have been devoured by this miserable game. And finally, the FREE DLC, HURRAY! FREE! It's strange that the DLC isn't at least 10-20 euros. At least they were aware of their capabilities. Alright, so, when I finished this awesome game, wanted to check out that spooky free DLC. I clicked it, and all I was seeing were that Garry was falling with his magic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥forearm-blue-plasma-gun, with that typical default model standing position, in complete grayness, and then the game crashed(for me at least, i don't have any friends who played this pile of junk). It's a shame that you can't delete games permanently from your library... 10/10			"

												Do you like games that spawn you under the map and kill you over and over? Do you like horrible guns that miss at point blank range? Do you like very stupid monkeys throwing rocks at you while they face the other way, and still hit you? Do you like crappy voice acting and crappy AI? If yes,  DONT BUY THIS TRASH ANYWAYS. Im embaressed to even have played this game. What did my computer do to deserve to have to run this garbage? This game is so broken that, you could clone Bob the builder 100 times and still no be able to fix it. Its called Day One because Garry could only take on day of this crap. I had to kill a bunch of monkeys, is that what games have come to? Killing little moneys? How can i call myself a man knowing i had to do that crap? The temple with all the traps took me three diffrent playing sessions, because i could not take the awful layout and setup. When you try to craft somthing and learn you can't, big bad Garry simply says 'UH OH'. I mean really, you dont say? The panther was stolen from a ps 1 game from the looks. When you stealth kill people they freeze up and fall over, and the women have the same sounds as the men when they die. The health bar is a joke because sometimes i die in one hit with full health, other times i get hit 5 or 6 times and some how poor Garrys still kicking. This game is like torture to play. I bought it because i knew it would be bad, but never could i have imagined this bad. The amount of time I die from a glitch, or even for no reason what so ever, is outrageous. 1/10 One point for making me rethink my life, trying to figure out what lead to me buying this.P.S. This game made my guinea pig cry, I hope you're proud devs.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing A this game is awful. From naming the game to sound like an amalgamation of DayZ and Garry's mod, to censoring youtube videos critical of this game, the developers are shady as hell and some of the worst I've ever seen.The first minutes of gameplay had no sound, mysteriously enough, and when I died from an unknown reason I respawned into a big hazy empty space from which I fell endlessly, dying again. Every subsequent respawn had me floating in the same place, even when I quit the game and started the survival mode, a mode COMPLETELY separate from the main game.Nope, spawned way in the sky, and died over and over again. Only when I completely exited out of the program did I manage to play.And what did I do? Chase monkeys around and beat them to death with what looked like a wooden machete which isn't as  nearly as amusing as it sounds.It's like somebody giving me a bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I couldn't resist taking a look because there were so many others talking about this bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥ But yep, it's♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

I really really did. I even gave it a chance (Mostly because I was dumb enough to not look through reviews first.) See I had been wanting a good survival game for a while now. And I did not find it in this. One of my main complaints about the game that I remember (Trying to block most of it out actually and forget I made this purchase) is that it has no sound effects. I mean really. You have the ceilling falling and it makes no sound? Come on guys. I had no idea what to do in most of the game. I was stuck in the first room for the majority of my play time because there was to indication of what to do. And the things you were supposed to find where practically hidden in shadows. Come on game, it's the first room. It's not supposed to be a scavenger hunt.			"

												THis game isn't good. At all. It tries to have a crafting system, but then the crafting system doesn't really even do much at all. And the things it does do, there's no way to find out how to craft them unless you just pure trail and error it. The story is god awful (at the start of the game, you have to untie yourself after being captured by tribals, AND THE GUY JUST STANDS THERE AND WATCHES YOU GET OUT), the animations are even worse than the story.The game also falls under the whole 'every game needs a gun' rule, apparently. Without even explaining it, you find an old flintlock pistol thing, and literally 2 minutes or less later you find a modern glock. I mean, what the hell is exactly happening in this game? And I just stopped playing after they make MONKEYS in the game the most dangerous thing. Don't buy, don't try. Also, there's a reason why the game dropped from 20 bucks to 5. Cash grab. Only reason I have is becasue they tricked my friend into thinking it was good and they bought it for me as a suprise... made me feel bad when I said that it was the worst game ever.			"

												This truly is 'The Room' of videogames.Story Mode is filled with bugs and glitches, a very vague plot that you can't quite make out but with impeccable dialogue from the enthusiastic VA for Garry. Sometimes models will disappear from your hands, the crafting is all quick time events, for some odd reason the foliage sometimes grows in size and shrinks as you move closer.UDK showcases it's true beauty when you ALT+TAB and all the textures stretch to the moon and back, improving the gameplay quality ten-fold. The monkeys are all OP, the humanoid enemies deal a lot of damage but can just be easily outsmarted by moving slightly to the left or right and the panthers are quick time events with Garry yelling ""IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?!""God forbid you try out the wonderful Survival Mode which consists of one loading screen, a lovely 5 second shot of Garry plunging into some beige looking void along with a very manly scream which then results in death and being sent back to whatever last save you had over in the Story Mode.There's no actual graphics options, just extras like V-Sync and Dynamic Shadows except for one box you can tick called Detail Mode which I suspect means ""Do you want graphics?"".I can't say I would or wouldn't recommend this game...it's an experience though I can tell you that.

No clue how they thought they could get away with a game unfinished as this. It's ridiculous. For example most of the sound doesn't even work. I'm sorry for the other developers in that bundle that they need to give away some of their share to Wild Games Studio's. Valve should pull this game from steam. DO NOT BUY.			"

												It is hard, nay, impossible to sum up exactly how horrendous this game. In short, everything is terrible. From the very first second the game launched, I knew I had made a mistake buying it. It reeks of poor craftsmanship, shoddy construction, and good ideas badly implemented. There is no sound, ever. I hit an enemy, no sound. A temple crumbles into rocks, no sound; the only audible thing once can hear are the terrible voiceovers of ""Garry"". I can not, in my current mentally sane state, recommend this game to anyone. Run as far away from this as you can.			"

												Minimal memory... 4 GB ram... Reccomended... 8 GB ram?! For a game that got released on Steam around 4 years ago at the time of  writing the review...Graphics are pretty bad and the game is just so unfinished, countless amount of bugs, the animation at the opening of the game already gives you an impression it must have been made by someone unfamiliar with IT stuff, or someone who put nearly no effort in it.Curious if even the more expensive PCs that are manufactured today would be able to run the game properly...Gameplay wise, I cannot review much, as the game always crashed my computer within 10 minutes of playing.Also do note the price of the game heavily discounted since its first release (I remember its full price was... 10€ or something around that) so that may also reflect the devs themselves are aware that the game isn't a success.The game had its potential, but the hardware requirements and low amount of effort that was seemingly put into the game killed it. Especially back in its days of being fresh on Steam store.			"

												Well, I gave it a fair shot. It's got an interesting environment and aesthetic style going for it, but it's presented in a really incompetent ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way. Really inconsistent framerate, bad or outright missing music and sound effects, really shoddy enemy AI, enemies take too many clumsy hits to kill, and lots of bugs. I decided to call it quits when I died and got stuck in a respawn loop of a loading screen and immediately falling under the game world, in an infinite gray space. The crafting mechanic seemed to be done in a kinda nice way (and I tend not to be that into these sorts of crafting survival games), but they are marred by too many quicktime events. And the story makes no sense. And the player character (Garry, I presume) has a lot of lame and unwelcome one-liners. And, well, yeah, it really is a sucky game, and I'm just adding to the gajillion other reviews that say the exact same thing.			"

												Played the game last night, sound something dissapears, leaving only fx sounds like gunshots and footsteps, can get stuck behind objects sometimes, would like to see some fix on collision between character and objects. Some objects cant be jumped upon even when clearly you could. Graphics aren't the best, but they are decent. Gun accuracy should be tweaked a bit since I sometimes miss while aiming right for the chest. Other than that seems like a good idea for a game. Not much creativity is expected from games these days since there are so many, but it has it's charm.Also some extended item description would be helpful, since you just kinda guess for example how much water or food you can get from certain things and if you have water in your flask.I would only sudjest anyone to buy and play this as a last resort, since it seems incomplete.

												I wish steam reviews would offer a sideways thumb option rather than a straight up/down thumb option, as I don't want to be forced to praise or condemn Day One: Garry's Incident. The deluge of derision this game has received is legendary and I don't want to be party to those kinds of criticisms. Does that mean Day One: Garry's Incident is a great game? Absolutely not. It's a severely mediocre game but certainly not as bad as other tried-and-true bad games.It feels more like a demo for something bigger but cut short by lack of funds or time (or both).Moreover, Day One feels like the developers couldn't settle on what kind of game they wanted to make. Is it a survival sim? No. It has a loose bit of ""survival-lite"" mechanics but that's about it. The survival aspect feels completely tacked on and has very little to do with the overall game or story. The survival mechanics are just a surrogate for more traditional ways of healing in other first-person adventures.Is it an FPS? Barely. As FPS goes Day One is clunky, slow and awkward. The weapons are uninspired and only the pistol and the alien blaster-thingy are any good. The other weapons are pretty useless. The enemies are It is a rip-roaring Indiana Jones-esque adventure? Maybe but the puzzles and traps are poorly designed as to suck any fun the game might have. The traps throughout are tedious trial-and-error speed bumps that force you to save often. The puzzles are dull and equally tedious; the temple complex in the second act, for example, forces the player to hunt down a half-dozen switches to open up the way to the next level, spread out over a ginormous Mayan temple that dwarfs the player that even running non-stop feels slow. Garry's Incident should be a lesson to its developers: develop a focus; fine tune your gameplay; make sure it's fun. This is where Garry's Incident fails. I can't help think if the developers had just made the effort they could have had a decent game on their hands but instead opted to make a quick buck and release it in a shoddy state.			"

My friend decided to buy this game for me as he is a bellend, has no heart and is the kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥who likes watching the world burn. Prick. Right lets get into this!CONS:The absolutely god awful sound effects. The sense of really being able to feel your brain cells die every time you try and craft 2 things together that don't work and the absolute vegetable of a character saying ""Uh oh"" in the most tone def way that makes you want to plunge the knife you carry around into your chest. Do not even get me started on the sounds when killing an enemy other than then♥♥♥♥♥♥hurling little♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ This sound alone is enough to make you want to fill your ears with expanding foam until the stuff comes spurting out of your nostrils.Next we get onto the enemies, on my first run through I was killed buy a thing that had more things orbiting it than the sun.  Since when do limbs float around the enemies! If you decide to play this game and see this enemy just run. This♥♥♥♥♥♥stain that roamed my screen for the brief time I played this game one hits you. ♥♥♥♥ that guy.Now I'm going to move onto them little ♥♥♥♥♥ that are the ♥♥♥♥ing monkeys. ♥♥♥♥ you.

												Absolutely horrible from the very beginning. So many bugs left, right and center - from glitchy menus to glitchy gameplay, nothing in this ""game"" works properly. Even shooting the first NPC once out of the temple left her stuck in mid air. The health bars don't represent actual health, the movement feels horrible and sluggish, even the graphics options look like they were left as some script language. Even if the hundreds of bugs were eliminated, the game still feels terrible and leaves me bored and facepalming. The story is just as bad, huge cliche mix of rubbish with cringeworthy voice acting.Avoid at all costs, spend your money on a worthwhile title. "

												If you're a fan of boring, stupid games, this is the game for you!the clunky controls weren't TOO bad, as you might get used to them. the amount of bullets that i wasted firing into the invisible walls which are located in the space above everything was very irritating and the AI was about as intelligent as a dead fly. I shot a man twice, while he ignored me and walked into a wall, then i walked up to him and he turned then ran to attack me, i shot him before he got close but i still took damage. i only hope the game developer gets ripped off one day the way i did when i bought the game.

												The game has a few crash bugs that I ran into in my short time playing.It's not really clear what I am supposed to do in survival mode to me and story mode had a crash bug.In suvival mode, I basically just sat in a shelter I built doing nothing besides eating food and drinking water occassionally. When it became night I slept. Nothing attacked me while I was in my shelter.I felt like I spent about 4 hours in the game but...			"

												Absolutely horrible from the very beginning. So many bugs left, right and center - from glitchy menus to glitchy gameplay, nothing in this ""game"" works properly. Even shooting the first NPC once out of the temple left her stuck in mid air. The health bars don't represent actual health, the movement feels horrible and sluggish, even the graphics options look like they were left as some script language. Even if the hundreds of bugs were eliminated, the game still feels terrible and leaves me bored and facepalming. The story is just as bad, huge cliche mix of rubbish with cringeworthy voice acting.Avoid at all costs, spend your money on a worthwhile title. "

												Personal Rating: 0/10This game is worse than Hitler. It's a disgrace to the gaming industry and the only reason I own this catastrophe of a ""game"" is because of some souless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gifting me it in the sale, with the text ""Enjoy ♥♥♥♥♥, hahahahahaha.""So, I loaded the game (after a lengthy sequence"" and I noticed the framerate. Maybe around 10 or 11 at best, which is the same for everyone. So, I quick time event myself out of the trap and kill the girl in the corner. Because ♥♥♥♥ Wild Heart Studios for thinking that what they did was acceptable. Such as WRITING FAKE REVIEWS ON METASCORE.Something to note about Metascore or Metacritic or whatever, the score that is first put on usually stays around for a while. So, on behalf of Wild Game Studios or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they're called, I'd like to put this statement forwards for them:I would like to apologise to anyone who thought that this would be a good, enjoyable game.I would also like to apologise to anyone who BOUGHT this♥♥♥♥♥♥in the first placeAlso, I'd like to apologise to the people who bought this in the Steam Sale, because spending your money on 5 Payday: The Heist soundtracks is of better value.♥♥♥♥ this game. ♥♥♥♥ anyone who was involved with it and I hope Wild Game Studios have learnt their lesson.

												I saw the reviews and thought to myself that this game can't be as bad as people say. The game starts off with a nice intro sequence making you think that it was worth the money you spent on this, but when you get in game, the lack of effort put into this is phenomenal.Pros:- Okay graphics, I'm being modest. It kinda looks pretty. - Crafting, the crafting minigame is 10x better than the game itself. (it gets annoying after the first time though)- There's food. If that makes a change. I guess it's a nice feature.Cons:-Missing sounds, lots of audio bugs.-Missing textures, lots of graphical bugs.-The most threatening enemy are monkies. -AI for the human enemies are not intellegent at all. No pathfinding skills and has an area of awareness around them, making stealth impossible.-The weapons are the following: Bone Machete, Old Pistol (Flintlock pistol), Modern Pistol and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Alien Wristrocket. The bone machete doesn't do crap, the old pistol is a two hit kill and the modern pistol and wristrocket are 1 shot kills. You are way too OP in this game against the tribe people. -Lack of Explanation. Why did your plane crash and why the hell are the monkies OP and kill you slowly and silently? ( This would probably be explained if I finished the game, I just couldn't bring myself to do it)-Saving is trash. If you're saving to quit and play again another day, you'll be lucky to not find your save file corrupt. You have to play through Garry's Accident in one sitting.-The puzzles are annoying, extremley simple yet take forever to solve. - You have a hunger and Thirst bar but don't worry about getting food and water, they don't decrease because it's broken like this game overall. Don't buy this. I wanted to laugh at how bad this is but I can never get my money back, sadly. I even bought it on sale for $1 and it still wasn't even worth it. Seems like they spent a lot of their budget in the intro sequence because it's just a downward spiral from there. "

												Buggy, Laggy, Ai is ♥♥♥♥ed. The game had potential and I can see that, the bugs and lag are the only things that worry me most, if it was optimized it wouldn't be as bad, the bugs being fixed would've solved a lot and then there's the Ai.. Oh god that Ai makes me want to tear my eyes out.4/10, would bang, but wasn't bangable enough!Please fix this, I really want to enjoy the rest of it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game because I felt bad that it got such a bad rep. If I could give it a sideways thumb I would because the concept isn't bad but the execution was poor. I played it for about a half hour and I just couldn't get into it. I watched a video by cynical brit about it and I think that the reason it has such low reviews is because of him... not because it's actually that bad (I mean it's bad but not so bad that it would get ""overwhelmingly poor""). If you have a hive mentality this game isn't for you because you'll likely jump on the bandwagon. This is a game for you if you are willing to put up with bugs and just want to have a bit of fun laughing at how poorly this game was executed.			"

												Day One: Garry's Incident does not fail because it's a bad game. It fails because it is an incomplete game. Parts of the game work well, and parts of it don't.Graphics: 6/10        In-game: 8\10        Cutscenes: 4\10The graphics in-game are genuinely beautiful, and I'm honestly surprised I got it to work this well on my computer, the cutscenes are a different story though... In the opening cutscene, Garry clearly dumps his liquor onto his crotch before drinking from it, and his other movements simply look unnatural.Sound Design: 4\10        Voice Acting: 6\10        Sound Effects: 2\10The voice acting, while not AAA, professional quality, is adequate. The sounds are adequate as well, when they work. Half the time, it seems that the sound effects simply cut out.Gameplay: 6\10        Combat: 3\10        Controls: 9\10I had absolutely no problems controlling the game, except for the overuse of quick-time events, but I had actually never experienced them before, so I'm not sick of them yet. The combat is set up so that you have two kinds of attacks and one way to block, but you can take out most enemies with the first attack alone, since it stuns them long enough for you to hit them again. MINOR SPOILER ALERT: The scene where the temple is collapsing around you at the beginning is genuinely awesome.Stability: 1\10Here's where the game really has its problems. Bugs are everywhere. Rather than an in depth analysis of them, I'll just tell you my experiences with them.Dies, loads autosave, falls out of the world, repeat about five times before I manage to shut down the game.Loads save file, encounters frozen tribe leader, opens inventory, game freezes, weeps silently.Low on health, uses bandages, ceiling caves in while I'm using them, finishes bandaging myself up, teleports to the sacraficial table without my pistol and magic gauntlet, weeps openlyEnjoyability: 7\10If you like bad games, or are looking for a joke gift for a friend, this game is perfect. Or if you like survival games and are willing to look beyond what are admittedly huge flaws then you could get some enjoyment out of it.Overall: 4.8\10Overall, if you're looking for the next great survival game, you will be disappointed. But if you've heard how infamous this game is and still want to try it, you will get what you're looking for.			"

												Worst release ever with The War Z. Game not finished, cracked up gameplay and narration, no IA, shame feeling and hitboxes... too bad because the graphics are acceptable and the character of Garry remains sympathetic. Even with patches, the roots of the mechanics are crippled, and the game is not fun to be played. Verdict : dont buy it.			"

Just play this game for a little while and experience the things the indigenous tribe of Day One: Garry's incident has to offer, like AI's with no run animations, awful stealth mechanics, missing assassination sound effects, frequent game crashes, and much much more. I say buy this game immediately at full price so that way you can truly appreciate other games that are not Day One: Garry's incident.			"

												UPDATE (of the update): Now the game is at 3,99... hmm... i think that an application with so many bugs at this price can even be a good expense, for a laugh or two, or three or four...I'm gonna recommend this joke of a game for the commitment of the developer who created the game with most bugs that can bug eachoter.It's not even complete, but the bugs are still awesome, in every way.The only feature that isn't bugged is, sadly, the card system of the game. But getting paid for being bugged with so many bugs at our already bugged times... it feels good.Make sure to don't miss such a beautiful work of high-quality bugs, before valve gets the insane idea to take this game off from Steam.Did i already said there are bugs? Yes?What are you waiting for, go get bugged!!!			"

												I really wanted to like this game, it looked like it had a good deal of promise. I thought $4 was a good price to pay for it, that it was worth a shot at that price. I was wrong. Very wrong.I should have listened to the overwhelming array of negative reviews. It seems to be using an old Unreal engine, like maybe the Unreal 2 engine or something, and the controls are just awkward. There are slowdowns (for seemingly no reason), long loading times, and this all spells a bad experience without even getting into the poor graphic quality and poor audio quality (yes, I know it's indie, I took that into account).Trying to exit the game after my 47 minutes of buggy playtime was an experience in itself. My system hung on a black screen for around 10 minutes (couldn't even CTRL+ALT+DEL), and my computer was slow for another 10 or so minutes after that with the harddrive being hammered the whole time. It even managed to crash the audio driver in Ventrillo (which I was logged into in the background). The error message said something about too much data being forced through the sound driver.Overall, my experiences with Day One were not unique, and I just cannot recommend this game to anyone.			"

												While, in the bottom of my heart, i want to say GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD, but in this case, I can't. Do no buy this game. It's just not worth it. Not because it's bad, it's just not worth $20 for 2 to 3 hours of gameplay. I can't even explain this game. When I started playing, I knew it was poorly made. However, I had to beat it. The so called ""Story"" just wasn't there. You do not do anything! You just wonder around looking for anything. The only thing you actually do is solve the ""puzzels"" to get to the next part. Food and Water are barely even an issue. When you complete each part of the area, and you start the others, you get full health and hydration. It is too easy to actually finish this chapter without actually having to eat or drink. I looked a few things up about this game and learned that the creator plans to do multiple chapters. Word of advice creator, if you plan to make more chapters after this one, for the love of god do it right. Take your time, and for the love of god, DO NOT CHARGE $20 DOLLARS FOR IT! 2 to 3 hours of clunky gameplay is not a good idea! For god sakes, The Walking dead only charged $5 for their chapters! That should be the most you charge. Good luck everyone who bought this and goodluck to you creator if you plan on making more games.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It may look sweet n' all, but ti's bugged beyong recognition. Multiple gamebreaking bugs..Even at the very beggining of the game, you get attacked during an unskipable cutscene, you wil die, and you wil ahve to start over.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!			"

												This game is absultely terri-bad, waste of 10$ ill never get back. The audio is missing from most parts, especially interactions, the combat system is horrible. The only thing nice about it is the graphics. By the 30 or so second video on steam, it seemed really smooth and cool, no, its not. I played for an hour, and it was overall choppy, with a poor design, that I can't even enjoy. 10$ wasted, and I can't get that back, or even a different game. But, if you like horrible games with terrible combat and interaction systems, then this is the game for you.			"

												Do not buy this. Literally, i got this for $2.49 and i still feel ripped off. I got this because i genuinely love survival games, even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones. But this is bad. I'll talk about the things i hated first. First off is the framerate. It's atrocious. The settings are not user friendly, and even on the lowest settings, it still runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Second is the animations, they look absolutely glorious. Honestly, if you want a laugh, swing your machete around a bit. it al looks like a dead body being controlled by a mass of wrigling fish inside them. Third, is the gameplay. This is how you kill everything. Swing machete, swing machete, and repeat until they comically fall over.  The only unique enemy is the panther. It jumps on you out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and you do an incredibly easy quick time event to jam your machete into its throat. Also, the crafting is also ran by quicktime events, and even they are minimalistc. Finally, its filled to the brim with game breaking bugs. Also the voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard.BUT, there are things i liked. The setting is great, and not done nearly enough. A greenery filled jungle is a great place to have a game! The concept itself is quite sound, if not 100% original. Basically, you crash your plane and now have to survive in a jungle full of unfriendly almost naked brown people! of course it is. And the music (the main menu music at least), i have to admit, is actually reallly great!In the end, this is Far Cry 3 if you made it not fun, and added a food  meter. unless it's literally 1 dollar, don't get it. A great concept doesn't excuse it from bein a great game. There are redeeming factors about this game, but they're buried under♥♥♥♥♥♥ Monkey♥♥♥♥♥♥ That kills you. 3/10			"

												Okay, this is one of the situations, where I gotta say that 2 bucks are too much paid for this.There's bugs all over the place, and it's just...stupid.I mean, I couldn't get out of the first freakin' room!The battle system is so bad too.. Also, why do dead HUMAN enemies respawn after reloading?Then, the girl you can rescue, which doesn't do anything at all?? And I could kill her the first time. And her corpse was screaming as I attacked her dead body, which..I should blame voodoo for..?So, another big problem with this game is, that when you just want to heal yourself, you have to mash buttons, and the right buttons, and that's annoying as hell. Did it try to be realistic there? Because in real life, you have all time of the world to just bandage your damn arm.Then there was this scene, where you have to duck and attack someone from behind, and you'd assume, he dies with one hit, just like in other games like that, but he didn't even seem to get more damage or anything. He survived as much as the first enemy. And again, why do they respawn, when you reload?!?So, you have to press 3 stone buttons and a shiny glove appears, which makes the building collapse. You take a lot of damage from being hit by whatever falls down at you. And when you want to heal yourself, you...need to do that♥♥♥♥♥♥with the button triggers again.. So, it's hard to get out.I saved right after I took the glove, and..kinda before the cutscene that makes the building collapse.When I reload, I have the glove, but the building isn't collapsing, and I can't get out.I wonder, if there's anything good about this game. In general, it feels like a rip-off mix. "

												I really wanted to like this game, it looked like it had a good deal of promise. I thought $4 was a good price to pay for it, that it was worth a shot at that price. I was wrong. Very wrong.I should have listened to the overwhelming array of negative reviews. It seems to be using an old Unreal engine, like maybe the Unreal 2 engine or something, and the controls are just awkward. There are slowdowns (for seemingly no reason), long loading times, and this all spells a bad experience without even getting into the poor graphic quality and poor audio quality (yes, I know it's indie, I took that into account).Trying to exit the game after my 47 minutes of buggy playtime was an experience in itself. My system hung on a black screen for around 10 minutes (couldn't even CTRL+ALT+DEL), and my computer was slow for another 10 or so minutes after that with the harddrive being hammered the whole time. It even managed to crash the audio driver in Ventrillo (which I was logged into in the background). The error message said something about too much data being forced through the sound driver.Overall, my experiences with Day One were not unique, and I just cannot recommend this game to anyone.			"

												[Re-Edit]Ok, so I was going through Program and Feautures to uninstall a couple of programs, then I came to a item called ""My Game Long Name"" from ""Epic Games, Inc."".Went through my registry to find out what it was and to my surprise (not really) it was this vomit.Really? Shows how little they are interested in developing games. I'll never buy a game (or any product) from this publisher again. Hey ""Epic Games, Inc."", you suck ad infinitum![Edit Updated: 11 Mar @ 12:24pm]Reinstalled this in the hope that a few things would be fixed, but not.DON'T BUY THIS![Old review = Posted: 16 Mar, 2015 @ 10:38am]Looked good at first, but is extremely bugged and confusing.Most ""positive"" reviews are sarcastic, however if the bugs were sorted out, I'd probably play it again.If this game was going for the least tested before release, it'll probably win.Btw the plural for fish is fish, not fishes.

												I give it a 2/10, 3/10 if I want to be optimistic. Gameplay tends to be laggy and uninspiring, and what little plot there is seems woefully lacking in terms of storytelling elements.  An information that *might* be useful in learning how to play via pop ups, which tend to trigger about half a minute after they would've been of use.  Combat elements are simple enough, but the lack of telegraphing tends to make melee fights a matter of luck more than skill...  And the game in general seems prone to various bugs.I bought this for roughly $1 USD while it was for 90% off... and I'm not sure I got my money's worth. :/			"

Spawning under the ground and repeatedly falling to my death rendering every game mode unplayable.Don't buy this game, Survival Challenge had me fall to my death, story mode worked for a little while until I died and it respawned me under the ground and had me fall to my death.  No new game option making the game unplayable.  Not that I'd want to play it again anyways.  Utter rubbish.			"

												You know I had just got done playing ride to hell: Retribution and that game made me want to kill myself and so I thought that i would just go ahead and chill out with a nice game and then I saw for the price of 1.99 Day One: Garry's Incident and hey for the price of 1.99 how could you go wrong.... Well let me tell you when I saw this abortion I had started playing and I already had the metaphorical knife to my neck with the mixture of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hit detection, poor frame rate, and poor voice acting that felt like it was ripped out of serious sam. This game was the worst thing I have ever experienced and to be honest this game could be free to play and I would still consider it a rip off. Sorry to break it to you but this game is such a waste of hard drive space that it actual makes me want to cry. The fact that my computer doesnt have tumors is a damn miracle from god.

Think about the unfathomable number of man-hours invested in learning about game design, the massive leaps in technology, the unending array of middleware available for developers of all levels. Think about how much awful shovelware existed for old systems, think about how many games were made by people who had no idea what they were doing, think about how many commecial products came out that simply Did Not Work.It is an honest-to-god achievement, in this day and age, to release a game that is an honest-to-god contender for Worst Game Ever.Day One: Garry's Incident, you are gaming history.

Unfortunatley the devs decided not to optimise the game at all and skimpped out on basic animations I.E attacks are always the same from the evil demon people and theexplosions would have issues. after the game was optimised though it proved a pleasent experience. the grapices setting the same i had more than a 40 FPS boost and could play with more than 60 frames. Unfortunatly the animations are the same and the crafting system can be useless. I wish the devs good luck wih later games but please make the launch better and the mechanics work.			"

												This is Temple Run out of the map in first-person.  Your first mission is to get out of a temple after you've killed some indian-egypt-african-aztec-dude, who for some reason doesn't know how to tie a rope probably so you can't escape. Why the f* can't he do that, when he has lived in the jungle since he was brought into that weird world by his mother when she died. --- And i say when she died, because everytime you kill a chick it sounds like she gives birth to an idiotic child with rabies. You only know what to do in the start and the rest of the game you run around and a pretend you're Bear Grylls lost on Madagascar. There's seriously monkeys running around throwing mangos at you, because they don't feel like eating that god damn mango. If i had a mango right now i would eat it. Those monkeys are some little unthankful c*nts and i hope they get stuck in some top secret mayan stone-trap and get crushed by a giant rock until their eyes pop out.But this thing actually is has a positive side too! You wouldn't believe it would you? Well.. If you don't have money for a Far Cry-game and just want cut animals open, you can do that! There's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pumas running around the jungle, which you can skin with the exact same animation they use in Far Cry! Though it's really bad because it's ""Day One: Garry's Incident"". They should call it ""10 minutes: That's the game"".Anyways.. This is great game! ... *cough* if you got dropped as a child on the floor *cough*.By the way. Why does the main character have so huge hands? Like really. It's like he's Bigfoots cousin.			"

												This is the worst game on Steam. Not kidding. Not just trying to say this is bad.This IS the WORST GAME ON STEAM. CONS:-Audio for the game is recorded with a 1€ mic. The voice acting in this game are made by the least enthusiastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ever. Period. When reading this, say ""uh get of me."", in your normal voice. Do it right now please. Congratulations, thats just what you'll hear when being attacked by a jaguar in this game. -Aimations are rough and AI must have been scripted by a 5-10 year old in 3 hours. I've never seen such horrible AI in a ""Game"" before.- Gameplaywise it's a mess. - Crafting is pretty much non existant. It's more of something you do to progress. Could just have been a table with a sign that says ""Press here to craft to move on"".-Handgun seems to be loaded with blanks.-Natives (back on the AI part) forget you if you walk to far away so you can enter the village and everyone charges you, kill one, run 10 feet back so they forget you and repeat. -Frequent crashes.-Sometime had to restart the game in order to progress.-Some stuff make no sense, for example you can trade with the first native you come across and she poses no threat, ALL others are just going to KOS and blindly run into gunfire.-No real ""Mystery"" Just scripted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that gives more of a ""uhm... ok? why?"" feeling. Pros:Decent meshes and textures. Procons:Not tried the new gamemode yet. ""Yet"" as in ""i'll never install this again over my dead body but if i do die and can still operate my body or computer i might install it to haunt the next person that starts my computer and checks my library. But not yet.""Overall 10/10Pay me Wild Games Studio			"

												This is the worst game I have ever payed actual money for. There are invisible walls that prevent exploration, bugged out natives with infinitely small hitboxs, & if the game crashes on you (which is a sad reality you must get used to if you plan on playing this game) there is a potential for the quest item you must pick up or wuest enemy you must kill to either disappear or spawn dead when you reboot the game. Guess what happens if you can't get the quest item or kill the quest enemy anymore. You can't complete the quest. & because this is a mainly quest driven game, you either start a new game or get comfortable in video game Limbo (the state in which a game is no longer winnable due to bugs or game errors). Trust me. You do not want to restart this game. DO NOT BUY! 0/10			"

												Might be cool once they figure out all the issues, but it's borderline unplayable right now. Game saves don't save the enemies you kill, so they are back around next time you respawn, among other glitches. Don't even buy it on sale, I regret the tiny four dollars I spent on it. Not worth a try until it gets some major improvements.			"

												Before I purchased the game I looked at the reveiws. I saw a few enraged critics saying this was a slow game, so slow they couldnt play and its a waste of time, money, and storage. Thinking that they were just graphic ♥♥♥♥♥s I dismissed it. I WAS SOOO WRONG. I bought the game and was heavily dissappointed. The frames per second was .004! I would write a reveiw on the gameplay but I simply dont want to waste 2 minutes loading the first frame. IM NOT EXAGGERATING! Heed my warning! (BTW I have a decent computer.)			"

												Absolutely hate the game. Stephane I would like to state that this is not me harrassing you. It is me simply criticizing you. I hope you understand that the game is a good concept but the way the developers don't listen to anyone is terrible and not something that should happen. I hope oyu have watched the TotalBiscuit video on you ILLEGALLY abusing the copyright claims just because he wrote something you disliked. We are in a generation of web and games. There are criticizers good and bad. Listen to both. Take action to what they say, meaning improve. You are only running away from something that's faster. I would have enjoyed the game if you didn't so desperately post fake reviews and such and sugar coated it all. Now, you may ban me but you know that I am correct and here is legitimate evidence of my truth. 


YouTube™ Video: This video is no longer available: The Day One Garry's Incident Incident 

			Views: 5,140,236		

			On the 18th of October, the developer of Day One Garry's Incident issued a copyright strike against my channel, effectively censoring the criticism of their game.		

 Read this and if you want your respect back apologize to the whole community to release a game that didn't need to be over hyped, which inturn proved to be an atroscity to what it was shown to be. Do us the favor and publicly apologize.P.S. I would also like to say 16 minutes of gameplay is enough to judge this game.Cheers,Diego your friendly neighborhood friend.			"

												At first I was ""recommending"" this game for laughs, but later I was having deeper thoughts about this filth. I can't actually recommend it at all.. Why? Because this game is an insult to gaming in general, malicious joke and complete waste of time. Day One: Garry's Incident tests your humanity, patience, sanity and self-respect. I don't encourage anyone to buy it. Please, if you've any brain cells left in your head, do not spend a single coin on this abomination. But if someone evil enough sends this game to you as a ""gift"" or you find a dirt-cheap bundle that has some awsome games with this abomination included... Take it! Try the game for yourself and see how awful it is! The videos you see in youtube is not enough. You just have to experience it yourself, but you might regret having this game in your library later.The only good thing about Day One: Garry's Incident is that after you spend 1 hour of playing it, you find yourself loving all awsome better games you already own even more...

(fake reviews and false backing [ohhh yes i know about the kickstarter chaps] of the game)trust me, it'l be a waste of money.(i got it free from a friend who did it to troll me, 80 mins thinking it'l get better, but it never did.)

												This game....There is no words.......the reviews are horrible...why did i try to play it...idk....my life.....is over. All in all you should get payed to play this, not waste money on it. And i say ""play"" no no no, if you manage to get past the loading screen of death when you first start the game, you deserve a noble prize, let alone play this game for longer then 20 minutes they should put your name in the bible. I Strongly advise you not to play with any fire arms, sharp or blunt objects around for you might find yourself bashing your skull in with with your little brother Timmys baseball bat you got him for christmas last year. Although, if you do manage to start the game, turn it off immediately.			"

												Since I am someone currently going to school in the field of game design, I was advised to play as many terrible games as possible to understand why they are bad.I have to say this game was so bad it was not even worth the learning experience, because the mistakes were so blatantly avoidable you would have to be either drunk or stupid to make them. I'd type out for you why its bad, but it has already been mentioned many many times by other reviewers. TL;DR See below			"

												Most of the reviews are from people that played less than an hour. Well, I've played more. I don't know why. I guess I was as drunk as the dude in the game. Either way, it's two hours of my life that I will never get back, and hours of crappy game play that I can never unsee. Please, save yourselves, don't do it. I mean, it SOUNDS good. It could have been a great game... if you know, they didn't do EVERYTHING wrong. I bought it thinking... ""It can't be that bad, and besides, I have found some great games that everyone else has said is crap"". Nope. I was wrong. It IS that crap. I refuse to even steamgift it when it's cheap. I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemy. I think it's best if we all forget about it, have it removed from steam, and pretend it never happened... like the copies of ET burried in the desert. Except let's never go looking for them. And we don't tell stories of it to our children, for fear that they may find the Game O Crap.It could have been so good...			"

Well I spent 30 minutes trying to rectify my graphics problem through the forums and playing with the resolution.  Oh and the whole cop out about meeting the min. requirements is bull.  This game should be taken off steam, so that other people can't be suckered into buying it. Oh and for the record I may not have the best going but I do have a NVIDIA       1 GB GEFORCE GT540M.			"

												When i first got into the game i started out with 15 fps. Then i got to the part when you get the the primals camp and found out that leaves are bullet proof. This is the best 3 dollars that were ever spent. Although i would never even buy this for my worst enemy. 10/10 would play again.			"

Posted: September 29, 2015
												I love games; simply said. i needed to play 5 min just to write the review but so far have played a couple hours. Its not as bad as the reviews put out. Game only crashed once, and i got stuck under the rocks at the very beginning after i picked up the arm weapon because i did not move right away, and i did not die. but so far quite smooth. hopefully it was just a hiccup. I will complete garry's incident, i just got it despite all those terrible reviews and will give a detailed truth be told opinion of this game from an old school gamer. Downloading now....... i have been playing video games since calecovision and atari 2600, my first computer was a tandy, took 10 hours to program hangman to play for 5 min. And now... On my 360, have been and was the all time gears of war #1 ranked in all ranked matches for 3 years solid. Hope my review helps.ok So far, I have journeyed into the wilderness into some unknown amazon, with crazy lil monkeys and panthers that race out of no where at you. Paint faced tribunal men that look like cannibals, and the freindly villiage people. Garrys Incident is not that bad, I am still going to finish this game, may take me a while as i play mulitiple games, but i will. So far its not bad. I am not sure where the developer was going with this as it is like other games, just an amateur version. Its a wonder that unreal engine is not being used to its fullest potential as i know from personal experience that unreal engine is sleek, with very fast elements for certain games, like Unreal tournament. I could say this would be a great first timer game getting into these types of games i guess as it seems quite hard, But to support a developer for 2 bucks is ok by me, so essentially i just bought a coffee. So far the game is actually quite hard, the crazy cannibals keep freaking me out i tried to sneak up on one but i can not seem to sneak attack, as soon as he knows your there its game on, its like the dude has just gone on insane mode, the reviews about garry's incident should be re-evaluated as i am not sure if people just have a hate on for the developer or not but i am sure these people are hatin cause they die, just like i have been, So if you think your getting ripped off, really your not as i have seen poopier games cost way more, when you think of the time, budget allowed, coding, animations, how many are working on it plus the payout of developers time really when you think about it, its change that he is making in the end of all the costs, If you enjoy games and story lines then i am 80% sure you will see what i see. But for overall grafic's its ok, but not great. i play on the highest settings but still does not really affect the game that much other than clear everything up but still pixels. I hope the devs really appreciate my review, I am quite a critic in life and can not say its as bad as everyone is saying, it just needs a little TLC and maybe some good freinds for moral support. You have a great engine to use there dev, so please use it. I am sure you did not get your education to be ridiculed over a game, personally i got this game because of all the bad reviews, it was almost forcing me to buy it as i wanted to make sure a hidden gem was not being disgruntled for no reason, It may not be a diamond, but it does shine, just needs some polish, plus you devs should also have youtube videos to support this game. I honestly could give donation coding to you if you like as i also used to do this for a hobby, and would even sign a waiver that you have all rights to the coding i give ya, i know legals and do not mind helping out behind the lines with no need for credit in any way other than the fact i could tell my grandkids about it. just not professionally but could have as i did get an interview with epic in toronto years ago when i applied through my xbox360, had no where to live after i got there, plus knew no one so i did not bother, i just kept on lobster fishing and working for a domain name provider.  I did catch the bottle of jack daniels at the beginning clearly labled as it used to be my favorite drink. So cheers, lets make some boiler makers... or apple jacks If you do not know what a boiler maker is ill tell ya... 2 Oz of jack daniels 1 Bottle of beer. 1 large enough glass to hold all of the beer and the shot glass. Fill glass with cold beer. ready yourself... drop the shot in the glass of beer. as soon as you see the shot glass is on the bottom, takes 1 sec chug your glass as fast as you can to empty.....apple jacksyour favorite ice cold apple juice or cidermix with jack #7 to taste mmmm let me know how many you could handle if you try it....

												I preordered this game and was pretty intrigued of what it offered because I do love stuff similar to Indiana Jones, basically everything which is about jungles and exploring. I started to play this game and managed to finish it. I was pleasantly surprised of the game, if you get past the glitches, random bugs and silly like voices and sounds and gameplay it is actually pretty nice game, although ending was like from a scifi movie and really didn't fit the game to be honest. Yes the game has it's problems but to me it was a good four and half hour experience with laughs there and there, half of that time I was running lost in the jungle not knowing where to go and what to do until I figured out the route. Would I recommend the game to my friends, well maybe not because not many actually would like it which is a shame. But my point of this review is that if it is on sale, lets say 75% off give it a shot, couple of bucks really isn't that much for a half broken game. I only wish sequel would be made or that it was longer.			"

												It's actually a very good game. My $7,000,000,000 computer over at NASA can run this game at a smooth 20fps. The combat and stealth systems are completely flawless. I believe that they worked very hard on these stealth and combat controls. The combat is very fast paced and definitaly puts your life on the line. The tactic that always works for me personally, is to crouch as soon as I can low health. This way, the enemies can't hit me. I can then easily run away to the camp. When I do decide to fight, its very difficult and makes my heart race. As long as I keep hitting the enemy, they won't move. At all. Overall, this is a great game. Just fix the god damn monkeys, holy crap their poop does a lot of damage. 10/10, would buy this game for all of steam.			"

												I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about other people's opinion to cloud my own opinion, I wanted to know it for myself if this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or not. And for a price where you buy a hamburger for which is done in a few minutes, I wanted to see and experience this game myself.The title screen was promising, I thought it was a zombie survival game, put when the gameplay started I was surprised. Nevertheless, I gave it shot. There were some rage moments (thus challenges to overcome), the puzzles were easy but some of them are almost impossible because of hitboxes that it made me almost quit the game entirely. But I kept playing it. The game evolved into a strange put urgent situation that I had to finish it, I don't know why. Took me 4.3 hours, most of the time is at that spot where the hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ed up and another level which was surprisingly extremely fun. I once got stuck at a certain point where I had to restart the game 10 times but eventually finished it and I must say that the game has potention but it's not quite visible. And 30% of it was extremely entertaining.Do I recommend it? Yes and no, but I do wait for the next episode!!! Can't wait! Developers? Don't see those bad reviews as a sign to stop making the next episode, learn from them instead. I am sure, the second episode will be a blast!But the game is playable to the end and it can entertain you for a few hours, in comparisation with the money you pay for it.I understand why people hate this game, don't be spoiled, the game has potention but is a bit worked out poorly. But it also has a lot of details, a lot of unneeded details in fact, but still. I had, unlike the complications it sometimes had, fun. YES! I HAD FUN!!! So there you have it, take it or leave it. Every person is different and you might be one of them, that appreciates a game like this.			"

												I stoped playing the game when I shot a small basket and the bullet rebounded and hit me in the head killing me.This was after around 2 hours of playing I had a good feel for the game,I knew how to craft how to shoot and what the game had to offer. I highly doupt anyone has ever played this game to the end because it is much harder then dark souls,It puts take down red saber to shame.Not because the game is really that hard you have 5 ways to attack all work fine.1.Is you stick machte thing:You get this right away, it lets you swing and block is good when you are fighting the monkys.2.The magic wristband thingy:This is like some sort of big blast that can take out any enemy in one shot but you can only rechagre it at these stone things but this one time I used it died then when I reloaded my save I was still out of ammo even though the save was before I shot it,so great is breaks the game to.3.The handgun: This thing allways acts like its hitting mettal even on peoples heads,other then that its a probly the best way to kill anything because its 2 shots vs the natvies and lets you shoot one shot after another.4.The double barrle shot gun pistol thing:This is the weakest ranged wepon and allways acts like your are hitting someone and making them bleed,even if you are shooting a rock,so it gives rocks blood great.5.Blowgun: I guess this is for stealth I never got to use it much but Its if you want to sneak.So ya you can handdle anything they though at you if you use anyone of these,no the game is hard because its just boring.Runing around the woods can get anoying because it all looks the same,and this is because you dont have a map,the game trys to tell you where to go with signs but they are hardly going to make it any better.If you play this game you will break,this game is one of a kind and can be marked up there with ride to hell retrubution.That being said I had more fun with this then ride to hell,because that game was so long and boring that it took far to long to get to some of the funny stuff later on.But this game thoughs evrey funny thing that can happen right away, if you alt tab at any time you go to limbo land,there is no sounds when the temple at the start of the game explodes,there is plenty of random and funny stuff that you can do in this game.So yes I totaly recommend this game if you want a good laugh,I feel bad for the people made this game,he just wanted people to like his game,he just wanted to be notcied,he even payed people who could survive in the game for several days in the games survival mode.This game just had bad luck around the time it came out and really does not desrve the hate it gets when games.Games like ride to hell are just called *jokes*, despite the fact that ride to hell can be offensive,this game is just buggy.But thats the thing you wont last long in this game it will  break you,but if you can get this game for less then 5 bucks (hopefully like 2$ bucks like I did) then its a good deal.Its more fun then call of duty,its more funny then goat simulator,its more garry then garrys mod.If you like games like warz,goat simulator,ride to hell,two worlds,sonic 06,elder scrolls 4 oblivion,and other such so bad they are good games,then you owe your self to check this one out!(This review as said above is before I beat the game,so I will update the game when I get around to beating it)			"

""Uhhh howbout I press dis button?""Let's face it. When we hear ""Day One: Garry's Incident"", we groan in agony. No one wants to suffer this abomination. It's a glitchy mess! It's like Far Cry's fourteenth cousin twice removed. Is it bad? Yes. It is. But, that's the thing. It's so bad, it's good. Because it's so bad, it's hilarious. It's all in good fun if you don't take it seriously.Now let's get down to business (A.K.A. the first five minutes of the game):You play as Garry, some middle-aged man who flies a plane over this inconspicious island. He's going to deliver some wooden crates. To where? No one knows. A volcano erupts, causing the island to explode, and a crate glows, creating a portal that somehow saves Garry's life. And now Garry is captured by male island natives, and they bring him to this temple. Garry is binded in rope. He gets himself free. He has himself a battle with a male islander that thinks he's a worthy opponent against Garry's bone machete. The islander dies a fabulous death. Garry saves a tribal female. Thus, you begin your journey as Garry.What was the incident that occurred that involved Garry? Who the hell knows?There are trading cards. That means you can craft a badge. That means you can get a Garry-rific background for your profile. That means you can get a few cents for your wallet funds. Chances are you'll get the Garry card for all three card drops. That happened to me. That's my incident.If you want stupid and pointless fun, get this while it's on sale.			"

												I feel like this game gets a bad rap. It really doesn't deserve all the hate. Here's a run down of the game and may I tell you now it can have a few spoilers so be warned.Day One: Garry's Incident takes place on a beautiful, luscious, eye candy of an island with amazing visuals and sound design that you really feel like you are in the world. You play as a character respectfully known as Garry. (I personally think he is a hunk, I would bury my face in that teddy bear beard of his and never let go of him. Garry is my true lord and savior and I would give up everything to be with him forever). Now, you crash land on an island after a giant anomaly hits Garry's plane, but miraculously he survives, and is taken in by a group of very nice tribal men who offer him tea and buiscets for the small small price of his squishy anal virginity. He refuses and they strap him down, man handling him like never before and they take him on a true ride. Now here is a big spoiler, the tribal men who are pretty hunky themselves have some fairly large horse♥♥♥♥♥♥♥which they release upon Garry, but he manages to break free from his restraints and take down what used to be the nicest men he had ever met. (They had sweet smiles that may have been semi-erotic but we will never know because Garry killed the ♥♥♥♥ out of them. And possibly had his way with them. Necrophelia is a huge fetish of mine.) This is where Garry escapes the tomb he had been soccumbed into, and he embarks on a journey to find true love, adventure, and hard liqour.Thank you for reading my review! I put a lot of time and effort in both the game and this review and I hope you enjoy Day One: Garry's Incident as much as I did! Oh! And before I forget, the game runs at a beautiful and constant 130 Frames, and never drops. It works surprisingly well. And the enemy AI is extremely smart. Seeking you out, and throwing grenades in mass in whichever trench or fox hole you wind up in. Reminds me of the good ol' World At War days. Except they throw fart bombs. More deadly. More silent. Anyways...I rate this game a 9 out of 10, the only thing lacking is the amount of playtime that you can put in without there being music, I heard the game has a massive beautiful sound track conducted by Hans Zimmer, the guy who did the MW2 soundtrack (Which I love so much!) but I guess theres a bug. But I trust these dev's will hammer out that little minor bug and get the sexy tunes rolling into my ears soon enough. Well, until next time!			"

												I got challenged by a Steam friend to play this game and I actually found it worth playing because of all the bugs. I hadn't had such a good laugh in a long time!Yes it crashes a lot, yes it doesn't really help you in your progression (especially for the crafting recipes), yes the AI is dumb as a doorknob, yes the level design in the maze is horrible but let's face it, when a panther is chasing you and gets stuck in a bush, when a monkey is throwing rocks at you backwards, when you get teleported back to the beginning of the level after drinking (unsafe) water from a pond or when the game autosaves right after you die and you get stuck in a death loop, you won't get such good laughs in any other game ^^.That's why I'd recommend this game, not for its gameplay but for its bugs. Happy crashing! :)			"

												After finishing this game, I have to say, that I cannot agree with ANY of the reviews I have seen for this game. Truthfully, I originally only purchased this game so that I could 'experience' it myself, as everyone said it was absolutely terrible and that I should ""Buy a sandwich instead"" (I got it on sale for 1.89 euro), but upon actually playing it myself, I enjoyed it and wanted to go back and play it again as soon as I got home from school. Sure, Healing was a pain as it took about 20 seconds to do, and at one point about 30 monkeys spawned at once and drove me insane, but the game as a whole was enjoyable. There's stealth (Not very realistic stealth mind you, but it felt good to sneak up behind an enemy and watch him/her tumble to the ground), Puzzles, exploration, crafting, food and water meters and large maps to make you really feel like you're lost in the jungle. The fighting wasn't the most exciting thing ever, but it wasn't hard or frustrating either. Once you get the M9, 2 shots and you've killed a guy. One shot for the animals. It allowed me to go through the levels without ever feeling stressed or annoyed, which, to me, is a good thing. Maybe I just got lucky, but the game only crashed once, and there were little to no bugs that I encountered throughout the whole game. I got out of the map at one point, but that can happen in any game (Skyrim being one) and doesn't make the game any worse (Better if anything! Getting out of the map is fun). The game also ran at full fps with near max settings for me so that wasn't a problem either. I know how hard it is to develop a game (I am a developer myself), and so I think they did a really good job considering they're just a small indie company, and it's terrible to see just how rude, disrespectful and heartless people are when it comes to this game. Sure, I found them funny when I first saw them, as I had never seen what the game was really like, but those comments prevent others from wanting to try the game (Myself included), which is unfair to both the developers and the people who are missing out.Is it worth 19 euro? Not at all. Was it worth the 1.89 euro that I bought it for? Every last cent. Heck, I'd pay 10 euro for this game and not feel dissapointed! Again, maybe I got lucky, but I really do recommend you try this game yourself next time it's on sale and see if YOU think it's as bad as everyone has stated.If I were to give this a proper rating, I'd give it about a 8/10 (Keeping in mind that it is only an indie game). It was very enjoyable and challenging at times, with good platforming parts, interesting puzzles, hidden secrets and easy but satisfying combat, but it's unnecessary crafting, long healing times, quick-time events, short game length (I finished it in less than 3hrs) and high asking price (Buy it when it's one sale) hold it back from being any higher of a score. However, I still highly recommend you give it a go yourself when you get a chance.			"

												Garry's Day Out received mainly negative reviews from critics, and holds a 21% ""rotten"" approval rating at the review website Rotten Tomatoes, with 3 positive reviews from 14.On the Siskel & Ebert show, critic Roger Ebert wrote that ""'Garry's Day Out' contains gags that might have worked in a Garry Herman cartoon, but in live action, with real people, taxis, buses, streets, and a real Garry, they're just not funny. The Worton twins are adorable as Garry Bink, however; the audience produced an audible coo the first time they saw him on the screen."" He gave the film 1 1/2 stars. His partner, Gene Siskel, however, liked the film because he thought that young children will love it for the survival elements.Also, not all other reviews were negative. Hal Hinson, writing for the Washington Post wrote, ""The pace is quick and efficient but never frantic...almost everything in the picture is just right, including the two-bit crooks who abduct the incidental man and end up bruised and begging hilariously for mercy. Best of all, though, is the Binkman himself, whose tiny face is so expressive that he brings new meaning to the phrase 'conquering with a gun.'""In 2010, popular internet reviewers RedLetterMedia delivered a scathing video critique of the film, drawing negative comparisons to The Three Stooges, Looney Tunes, and Home Alone.

												This game has potential but the execution is very rough around the edges. Imho this game should have been marketed as early access or released on Desura first (for a low price) instead of Steam.This being said, the game is fun to play despite its roughness. The crafting is actually quite good and it is well integrated into the survival element.The graphics and sound are rough but not horrible, they do the job.The combat could have used some balance and tweaking and just like the rest of the game...its rough around the edges but its passable, it does the job and you know what? I have seen worse combat than this in some very popular games that i will refrain from naming.Maybe because of the interesting setting and very good base idea, the game feels better than the sum of its parts.Given the reviews it got, i bought it mostly out of curiosity to see how horrible it could actually be and to my surprise it ended up being not so bad at all.Its definitely worth the $2 it sells for right now.If i was to rate it based on execution and presentation i would have to give it a 4 or 5.But if i was to rate it based on the fun i had playing it, it would be an easy 7.I chose to ""recommend"" this game for two reasons: it got too many unfairly negative reviews and for $2 it is indeed recommendable.

												Want a game that's stupidly optimised? Thinks your monitor can display 1440p when it only supports 1680x1050? A game that looks like it's from 2005? Then this game is for you.However, from the time I've played this game, I not only found myself walking around the room you start off in for 20 minutes, I also found myself laughing alot at how you can shoot the ground and kill yourself. Not only that, Garry was not in any of the FMVs. Also the poor animation, low quality models / textures and funny voices in this game make what's great about it. Also spam clicking a button to make a ding noise. Long story short, it's a bad game but it's so bad it's worth getting for the laughs.			"

												Despite all the negative reviews, I enjoyed the Story mode of the game. Took about 5 hours to go thru (without stressing).The only major issues i ran into was:1: The game crashes from time to time. (seems to crash alot more often early on in the game than later).2: There is a cap on how many saves you can have (being it's an Save/load game. this is annoying), So you have to manually delete saves in the title menu).3: Early on in the game and late game the save button seems to have a mind of it's own, and only works when it feels like it.Minor issues: glitching textures, water disapearing, lightning/sunshafts where haveing a seizure, but was easily dealth with in options. and some other stuff.Try to look past all the negativity people seem to have about the game, the glitches & issues. and give it a chance with your own opinion. for the price .. 5h~ entertainment, Fun puzzle stuff and exploration (story mode). It actually wasn't that bad, Enjoyed completeing it.			"

												I think this game receives too much flak, people bandwagoning on a hate train created by popular Youtubers. Sure, it is not perfect, but nothing truly is. I see this to be like another Bubsy 3D, a gem that is simply thrown into the trash by people with unrealistic standards. Not everyone can create a Triple A budget title, and have to make do with the tools available to them. And in this regard, I see Day One: Garry's Incident as a rather fine title. If I were to change only one thing, it would be  to have multiple areas which would load separately, so not to stress the system too much. This simple fix could turn this B- game into an A for me.Don't fall victim to this blackhole of negativity. This is hardly one of the worst games ever, like so many claim. I mean, if it were that bad, it'd have been taken off Steam by now, like so many other titles. Such as Ride to Hell and War Z.To conclude my report, this game is a fine deal for the low price it is at. Just do not expect it to be on par with something like the Nathan Drake series, which I feel this is very comparable to in terms of setting, themes, and characters.Thank you for reading, and I hope anyone who decides to purchase this title will see the positives to it. Such as a nice variety of weapons, a crafting system, and survival mode which I feel surpasses that of Rust, Garry's other project.			"

												While the controls are clunky, this game still had a decent sense of adventure and exploration to it.  And in that regard, it has a lot in common with the Uncharted and Tomb Raider series...including a single player story that clocks in under 8 hours.  Unfortunately that is where most of the comparisons end.  I probably should have given this a negative review, but I am kind of hoping future parts of the story will be released episodically to find out what else happens to Garry.			"

												Day one : Garry's incident is a very nice looking game,the textures are nice and just everything about it is nice. it reminds me alot of rust with the fps fighting and crafting and that kind of stuff. i do think that they should add more animals and different kinds of people like ones that wont hurt you or something like that. but in my opinion it is a very good games :) "

												When you play the game first and then watch the trailer, you notice how many sound effects are missing in the game. Such as the panther growling when it attacks you. It doesn't in the game, it in fact makes no sound at all. And a lot of sounds are missing from the game. You can never hear the enemy approaching you, because nothing is heard from them. I once got attacked by one tribeswoman and was killed by a second, as the second was hitting me from behind and I had no idea she was there.The combats are weird to say the least. You have no idea how much the enemy is injured or if you injure them. I shot a tribeswoman 4 times with a gun and she kinda flinched in pain, then not only walked (well, the tribespeople moonwalk in this game... ), but she ran back to her tribe when she noticed me. When she returned and attacked me, I stabbed her twice and she fell over dead.Gun bullets appearently can't travel more than 3 metres in front of your character, as I tried to shoot two tribesmen who were clearly in shooting range, but my bullets.. um... magically disappeared? There was also this tribeleader who was trying to kill me, so I stabbed him repeatedly, and he looked a bit offended until he fell over dead. And appearently you can't make fire with a lighter and a piece of cloth. And our hero who knows how to fly an airplane doesn't know the basics of making a campfire. His response to discovering that a lighter can't put a cloth on fire? ”UH OH!”The game isn't ”awful funny” enough for me to continue playing it and it wasn't interesting either.			"

												Scores are at the bottom.Setting:  You are Garry; an alcoholic mourning the loss of his family.  One afternoon, you go for a plane ride on business to deliver a few things.  All of a sudden, a volcano erupts, and the turbulence bring you down.  Even though you were certain to die, a strange package activates an ancient power in an attempt to save you.  You wake up, about to be sacrificed to an aboriginee tribe's deity.  You notice that there was something even stranger about these people.  You free yourself, kill your opposition, and solve an ancient puzzle that hides an ancient weapon.  The temple caves in, and you just barely escape death for the second time.  This is where the game begins.Review:Usually, when I see a game with such negative reviews, I'm ever tempted to buy it, just so I can confirm the reviews are honest.  I had just gotten a USD $50 gift card for Steam.  I bought the games I wanted, and had USD $4 remaining or so.  I'm very impatient when I have money, so I had to find something to spend it on.  This game, along with Takedown: Red Sabre, came on sale for USD $1.49 each.  I caved, and bought both.  I will tell you, the time I have in this game was real play time; not just letting it run for cards.  That was just compensation for the time I wasted in this game.I usually appologize or beg to be heard out for giving a negative review, but I feel it's not necessary here.  As soon as you load the game, you notice your framerate drop tremendously, even on higher performance PCs.  After you find a way to stablize your framerate, you begin the game.  You see a dream of your character's wife calling to him.  The dream ends, and you see your character.  It's obvious that cutscenes were a last minute idea for the game.  I've seen more stable animation in Garry's Mod.  Why, oh why do you share this man's name, Garry?  The voice acting is less than pleasent, and the graphics are horrendous on all but the highest performance PCs.  The story is not well put together, but passable.  The inventory system is interesting, and is good in concept, but severely lacking in implementation.  The bad combat system and bountiful amount of bugs almost rival that of Aquaman: Battle For Atlantis.  Almost.  Oh, who am I kidding; nothing is worse than that.  The plus, however, is that the game does have a good soundtrack.  That alone may save it from getting eternally condemned to the less than 4/10 zone.Scores:Story: 5/10Stability (Lack of Bugs): 2/10Stability (Performance): 2/10Combat System: 3/10Soundtrack: 8/10Replay Value: Undecided...Final Score: 4/10.Recomended buy price:  Undecided...Final Thoughts:That was honestly unintended.  I consider a game ""condemned to death"" if their overall score goes below 4/10 (even if it's 3.9999999999999999999999999999999) which is generous, considering most people say that about 6/10 games and sometimes even higher rated games.  I cannot recommend this game.  I will play it again, if at least just to complete the story mode and establish the score for replay value.  If you genuinely want to judge this game for yourself, I won't (and can't) stop you from buying it.  I do, however, recommend that you AT LEAST buy it when it's on sale for USD $1.49.			"

												Do not, and i repeat. DO NOT buy this game. It is down right awful. Enemies hit you without even being near you. I died countless times literally for no reason. And while you are interacting with something, enemies still attack you and you die when youre done what you are doing. Looked good on the screenshots. But i seriously cant beleive i even paid $4 for this junk. I dont even see what the devs were even trying to accomplish. Dissapointment for the unreal engine.			"

												i personaly did not find this game verry fun, it was slow and glitchy at the start and hard to know what the objectives where afterwards, button controlls were difficult to implement, died verry quickly and their is not guide or understanding how to craft or acheive anything ther than getting slaughtered by people with bad graphics and blunt objects			"

												Cannot recommend this game.The gameplay is solid. The plot seems okay, if a bit odd. But the controls are finicky: aiming is odd, and it doesn't seem to matter where you aim. And everything is accomplished via quicktime events, up to and including healing yourself, which is a ~20s ordeal just to recover half health. And to create the bandages is itself a 10-15s activity.Besides that, the devs seem to have... forgotten sound. If you're standing still, there is no sound at all, and when moving it's like footsteps echoing in an empty room. No breathing, no ambient sounds, nothing. Basically, it's ok overall, but the silence is offputting and the QTEs, the low quality animation and the shoddy controls put this at bargain-bin levels.			"

												The worst game I have ever played in terms of stability and completion :- A lot of sounds are missing. This destroys the immersion and the gameplay. For example, sometime you get hit by a guy that's behind you. And while he is hitting yo, he makes no noise at all. You realize something's wrong when you take a look at your life and see it moving...- Game is often jurky on recent computer (Intel i7 + Geforce 670)... Even the menus are not fluid...- Got 2 game crashes in 30 minutesI'm trying to find out if I bought an alpha game but I can't see any information that says so on steam store. I'm so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off !			"

I can easily kill a Native with a stick, but get swarmed by monkeys throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥and die to that...You DO get to play a drunken slob for a ""hero"" but that's maybe worth $0.50, if you put a value to it. The combat is ♥♥♥♥ing horrendous, the graphics are like something from like 2001 (seriously, you couldn't get more out of the Unreal engine?), and when you DO get sound, Gary's voice actor sounds bored. I can't believe anyone ever published this crap, but I tell you what, it's actually kind of funny in how bad it is. I probably have gotten about $1.99 worth of laughs out of it by now. Plus some of the Youtube walkthroughs are nothing short of amazing in their comedic value, but those are free, so go watch them and skip the game. I'll keep playing it a little while longer for the train wreck value, but that's about it.			"

												The basic idea of a Survival FPS is very nice but the game is quite bad. Graphic and sound quality are not so good, but it's an Indie game so we can pass out. Speaking about the story there is nothing fascinating, most of the time you follow an unexistent storyline that make you walk in a ""beautiful"" jungle and ancient temple (quite a maze), killing strange natives with blue eyes called ""infected"" even if you don't really the reason why they are aggrressive. About the ending, well i think it's the most nonsense part of the game. But if you really want to try it, just relax becouse the game is full of bugs that sometimes make you very angry, in my opinion this is the worst aspect of that.			"

												I managed to get this for 1.99... Even at this price I feel cheated! There is very little story line, and when you do manage to beat it the story isn't finished. The developers added a little ""thank you for the support"" note and say ""tell us what we should do in the next chapter on facebook"". This game isn't finished and it shows horribly with glitches everywhere in this game. I even got stuck in a loading loop that forced me to reset my PC because neither altctrldelete nor alt F4 would work! The crafting was set up in a cool way, the graphics are okay, and I can see where the developers were going with the story, but it really needed polished and finished. I wish that they would've taken more time and finished the story before releasing it because I doubt this game will ever come to a conclusion with all the bad press.			"

Day One: Garry's Incident ReviewNOTICE: This is the one game I will not follow my standard of 3 hour gameplay, it is so bad and unplayable, I cannot continue to play it.Gameplay:You are in the middle of delivering a package and a volcano goes boom. You awaken being dragged by the low end of models and are a sacarifice. Then I have no idea what happens next... You do something and it bugs out. I cannot complete a mission even if all of the things are done. So I was walking around for nothing.Gamemodes:Yes there are game modes, Story mode and Survival mode.Story:Like I said for gameplay, Story is broken. You are also an alcoholic and have a dead falmily, for whatever reason that is too clichéd in today's games. for the first startup, a mission was to kill a panther and give it to a tribeswoman for your alcohol flask that does nothing in the game to ease the thirst meer. You killed it with a QTE(Quick-Time Events) that were awful and no randomness. And would complete the mission, and no meat was taken... What? I booted it for the second time and things were slightly working better. Oh, and no way to get me out of the second chapter in the game.Survival: You have to survive for the longest time possible. That is all you have to do. The way you find things are pointless. I cant even find sitcks to even build a fire. Yet I could pull them down IF this was a real life event. I cant complete it and cannot do anything.Graphics & Performance:Graphics settings on max settings are still awful to look at. There is a compass on the HUD that does noting other than look important. Performance is barely achieving 30+ FPS according to the Steam Beta FPS counter. Loading times are not very short. View distance is very short. It is goes like this for the example of Grass: no grass other than floor texture for 15 ft. Then some grass 15 ft to 10 ft. then some medium quality grass at 10 ft. to 5 ft. then some ""high"" quality grass from 5 ft. in. Models are low quality and break if you Alt+Tab out of the game. Floor texture hates that and can go crazy, some weapons like the gauntlet can dissapear and only have the hand. While charging the weapon up, there is the most annoying lens flare that makes the screen fill with lots of blue... When you shoot the gun, It always thinks that there is a person or NPC that is killable, so red comes out of of where you shot it, no matter a tree or the ground.Controls:Nothing to me is entirely wrong with the keyboard controls other than the crouching., which is a toggle and I hate toggles. The mouse sensitivity is AWFUL. i require games to have the game sensitivity to be ignored and use the hardware that my mouse has, since I have a DPI switch for FPS and in general video editing. There is no hardware selection and then my mouse goes no where, 1800 DPI goes crazy and on default sensitivity. DPI switch makes it worse so that is out of the question bad for me.A.I.:A.I. have laser sight vision, take way too much ammunition to kill one single person. If you happen to hear any monkeys, you can bearely see them. They also for some reason CAN'T ATTACK you if you are on a pyramid that you investigate. not smart and bad. If they run away from you and they hit the draw distance, you can see them stuck in a jump and cannot do anything at all. A.I. are not killable if they don't see you, so sniping them is pointelss, unless directly behind them.Audio:Voice acting was terrible, the lines were not well written and the weapon swich has the worst audio quality. Gun sounds are awful and muddy. Some sounds for me were broken until 2 reboots of the game.Maps:Very big, Almost like someone would have some error in development. You can get stuck in certain parts of the map and cannot get out. Shooting behind a rock is pointless. There is an invisible wall that is there for a reason to♥♥♥♥♥♥all of us off, refer to A.I. with out walls that existU.I.:Not really good, compass is useless. Health is defined by a bar, no number which is difficult for me. Not good in general.Final Verdict:If you like bad writing, muddy graphics, and a barely functional game? This is the game for you... Now for those who don't like it, STAY AWAY.Score: 0.25/10Sentence: Stuck in a rainforest with tribes people (Hell). Stay away, Don't buy, torrent, or pirate this piece of crap. Shocking that Unreal Engine was in this too. "

												Here is my Let's Play playlist for Day One: Garry's Incidenthttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB43U5A34lu-YiTtoc_jB6BxXp7DfIWaJThe Verdict:overall, I would say no. I played this game full through and it isn't a bad GAME, just a bad EXPERIENCE. The game is super buggy and glitches. The story line makes no sense. It just was not a good experience, very dissapointing. I would say that, since I paid $2 for this game, that if the game was revamped and remastered, it should be that much. Until this game gets an update it should be free. The crafting system I liked a bit, the interactiveness of it was interesting. It is a decent puzzle game per say, but I would not spend money on it in it's current state. Am i looking forward to Day Two? If they read all the imput people have said about this game and fix it, then I would say yes. Like I said, not a bad game, just needs to be fixed up.			"

												Absolutely the WORST game I've ever played. Unforgivably bad. I tried, I really tried to give this game a fair chance. I read bad reviews months ago, so I had hoped the bugs were fixed. I tried, but the game was so bad I only made it through about the first 5 minutes of the game (though it took about an hour of my time). The voice acting is terrible, for example, if you make a mistake crafting, the character spouts off a goofy ""uh oh!"" Also, why would anyone want to have an animation, complete with quick-time action events...for crafting. The amount of pop-in I experienced made me feel like I was in a laser light show funhouse, and environments were bland and boring. When I killed my first jaguar, it immediately disappeared, so I couldn't skin it and complete the mission. Worst of all, at one point, when I tried to load a save file, the ground wouldn't load. I'd be treated to 45 seconds of loading screen, followed by 2 seconds of falling into a gray abyss, then cue loading screen. The whole premise is campy and weird. And why are there guns randomly strewn about? Why is the player so slow? Why do the natives' clothes only load half the time? Bottom line: Don't buy this game no matter how cheap it is. It's not worth your time. "

But i seriously cant beleive i even paid $4 for this junk. I dont even see what the devs were even trying to accomplish. Dissapointment for the unreal engine.			"

												well i can't recomand this as the game states exporation and the game is guided its not funny its a coridor but with some small off track deadends with no real meaning to them, the craft your weapons is a joke as its craft your weapons when we say so ""when you find them""and the guy you play is so strandly ok with everything.... just kidnapped by strage tribemen and going to scarficed, his reponce is ""not today mate"". that the sripted autosave is not frecent enought.

Bad gameplay, half decent visuals, an awful storyline if u can call it that, the supposed craft system is a mess, just find stuff in the world and combine them (craft.. yea right), every time you do anything have to go through a quick time event..Bottom line: stay away from this even if they are giving it for free... trust me, its that bad.

												Simply a bad game! Only sounds are those of your feet and gun, and they are extremely badly made. No music, no ambient sound or anything else for that matter. Can't say anything good about the graphics either. And this badly executed work continues in the story, you just suddenly start the game with barely any backstory and just get this empty feeling. I paid 1.90€ for the game and cant really say it's worth it. I will most likely never touch the game again unless MAJOR improvements are made.			"

												It's surprising to find out this game is a finished release and not early access.  It plays like an alpha.  Sometimes sound effects stop working for no reason.  The frame rate is choppy even on high end machines.  Often the A.I. will completely break leaving enemies immobile or just randomly dead.  Animations are also particularly terrible.  Avoid paying full price for this game at all costs.  Your $20 would better serve you as a tissue.			"

												I had some really high expectations of this game at first, the graphics are beautiful and the UI is stunningly minimalist and modern. I expected an experience similar to 'The Forest', but with more variety and a story-driven plot.As soon as the game starts, things start to go downhill. From the beginning scenes in the tutorial we are shown an almost offensively problematic portrayal south american natives through a very white colonialist lens and rather than attempting the pretence of mocking and subverting damaging stereotypes (A la Far Cry 3, whose claims of the writers are dubious but visible) we are sincerely subjected to scenes of mystique sacrificial ritual and what I can only assume is supposed to be a portrayal of some kind of ""Voodoo""/Black Magic (Y'know given my experience of the game so far I'm actually going to go ahead and say 'Aliens'. I haven't ventured far enough into the game to learn if I'm right and if there's a god or some kind of benevolent demon I can sell my soul to I never will).Being an obviously superior drunk ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, of course you overpower your captors (THROUGH A SERIES OF QUICK TIME EVENTS 0^0 SPOILER ALERT QUICK TIME EVENTS ARE USED FOR ALMOST EVERY ACTION IN THE GAME, IF YOU HAVEN'T READ LITERALLY ANY OTHER REVIEW HERE TO LEARN THIS ALREADY) and escape into the rainforest using your superpower of hardened-drunk-white-guy-who-needs-a-drink (It's almost a little noir. Almost. Imagine Max Payne as a bush pilot, except without the writing and characterisation). The first thing that happens as you enter this apparently undiscovered world? A native steals your flask! You must give chase, the end to which is a stretched skin canvas with vague pictorial instructions drawn on it. The native who stole your flask is willing to trade it back to you if you find her... something? It was forgettable and largely irrelevant. I don't even care any more but I would sure love some of whatever was in that flask, I need to purge my memories of having tried this. I can't even be bothered writing anymore of this review. Oh my god it's awful. It is so bad, the crafting is pointless, the plot is lurid, the voice acting hammy with little to no characterisation to speak of in addition to the game largely just being offensive.I thought at ~$1.00 on sale I would receive a game that was playable, maybe a little fun and the bad reviews were hyperbole, but it is just tortuous and incredibly poor taste. The positives? The visuals really are quite good, like AAA quality, the games artists and visual designers should be applauded; it's such a shame they were wasted on such an incredibly poor title. Seriously, if the technical gameplay faults outlined in the other reviews aren't enough to steer you as far away from this title as possible then let these warnings guide you instead.Maybe next time I black out drunk I'll revisit this for some laughs and be able to pass out thinking that Day One is a metaphor for how every shiny promising thing that happens in life somehow turns to♥♥♥♥♥♥Now I must get back to writing my thesis, I can't even bear to use this for procrastination material.

												I only recommend this game for the ones who have lots of free time to play. And only if you buy it on a sale.The concept is good, it can be interesting to try, but the game feels a bit unfinished.There are bugs, that delay your progress (like you loose water and food levels, or killed enemies respawn beside you when loading the game).The graphics are OK, the controls a bit clumsy.It's not that bad, as some review say, but you can spend your time with better games.

												Absolutely the WORST game I've ever played. Unforgivably bad. I tried, I really tried to give this game a fair chance. I read bad reviews months ago, so I had hoped the bugs were fixed. I tried, but the game was so bad I only made it through about the first 5 minutes of the game (though it took about an hour of my time). The voice acting is terrible, for example, if you make a mistake crafting, the character spouts off a goofy ""uh oh!"" Also, why would anyone want to have an animation, complete with quick-time action events...for crafting. The amount of pop-in I experienced made me feel like I was in a laser light show funhouse, and environments were bland and boring. When I killed my first jaguar, it immediately disappeared, so I couldn't skin it and complete the mission. Worst of all, at one point, when I tried to load a save file, the ground wouldn't load. I'd be treated to 45 seconds of loading screen, followed by 2 seconds of falling into a gray abyss, then cue loading screen. The whole premise is campy and weird. And why are there guns randomly strewn about? Why is the player so slow? Why do the natives' clothes only load half the time? Bottom line: Don't buy this game no matter how cheap it is. It's not worth your time. "

												Here is my Let's Play playlist for Day One: Garry's Incidenthttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB43U5A34lu-YiTtoc_jB6BxXp7DfIWaJThe Verdict:overall, I would say no. I played this game full through and it isn't a bad GAME, just a bad EXPERIENCE. The game is super buggy and glitches. The story line makes no sense. It just was not a good experience, very dissapointing. I would say that, since I paid $2 for this game, that if the game was revamped and remastered, it should be that much. Until this game gets an update it should be free. The crafting system I liked a bit, the interactiveness of it was interesting. It is a decent puzzle game per say, but I would not spend money on it in it's current state. Am i looking forward to Day Two? If they read all the imput people have said about this game and fix it, then I would say yes. Like I said, not a bad game, just needs to be fixed up.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I wanted to say the bad reviews are just because it's not that great... You start off. You have to kill a guy. The first fight in this game and the combat already feels boring and repettitive. After winning the fight Garry says ""Should I save her and risk my own life? Or leave her for her fate"" But, there's no way to save her.... Then, you're thrust into a puzzle, a very stupid puzzle that is written on a wall..... Then You find another 1 guy. A pistol and some weird alien thing that's completely unexplained. And Garry seems excited about it. Upon that part the temple caved in and I crouched into an area that I couldn't get out of. I crouched in that way, but could not get out. I fell into a pile of rubble and was stuck. Good game. At least it has cards I guess... RIP $2			"

												I got this game because i didnt believe it was as bad as the overwhelmingly negative reviews say that it is. To keep it short, i was wrong. This game is absolutely sickening. It made me want to gouge my eyes out at the first few cut scenes. This game was made last year and it has horrible animations, voice acting, you name it. The fighting scenes are abysmal. Ive gotten killed from yards away in 1 hit before. There is no audio in cutscenes for me, Bottom line is, this game made me want to end my life in ways that stephen king couldnt fathom. 69/10 ign like skyrim with queer.			"

												ABSOLUTLEY ♥♥♥♥ING HORRIBLE... i bought it during the steam summer sale like hey this dosent look so bad. worst way to spend 2$ ever. theres practially no audio for anything, the ai is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ the cutscenes are clunky and boring, everything is too predictable, its honestly the worst game ive ever played. total♥♥♥♥♥♥ ive played MUCH better indie games. like castle minerZ, Total Miner, or FarSky. All of which are definetly worth getting. especially FarSky. but when a game that should be professional is easily beaten by indie games, or a ♥♥♥♥ing board game or chinese finger cuffs or what the ♥♥♥♥ ever, you know you wasted your money and you know the game is total♥♥♥♥♥♥ please. do not make the mistake i did and buy this game. not even two dollars. I would honestly uninstall it even if it was free. its that bad. it irritates you seeing such a horrible game. so please for the love of bacon dont ♥♥♥♥ up like me and buy thise piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Please.

												I had some really high expectations of this game at first, the graphics are beautiful and the UI is stunningly minimalist and modern. I expected an experience similar to 'The Forest', but with more variety and a story-driven plot.As soon as the game starts, things start to go downhill. From the beginning scenes in the tutorial we are shown an almost offensively problematic portrayal south american natives through a very white colonialist lens and rather than attempting the pretence of mocking and subverting damaging stereotypes (A la Far Cry 3, whose claims of the writers are dubious but visible) we are sincerely subjected to scenes of mystique sacrificial ritual and what I can only assume is supposed to be a portrayal of some kind of ""Voodoo""/Black Magic (Y'know given my experience of the game so far I'm actually going to go ahead and say 'Aliens'. I haven't ventured far enough into the game to learn if I'm right and if there's a god or some kind of benevolent demon I can sell my soul to I never will).Being an obviously superior drunk ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, of course you overpower your captors (THROUGH A SERIES OF QUICK TIME EVENTS 0^0 SPOILER ALERT QUICK TIME EVENTS ARE USED FOR ALMOST EVERY ACTION IN THE GAME, IF YOU HAVEN'T READ LITERALLY ANY OTHER REVIEW HERE TO LEARN THIS ALREADY) and escape into the rainforest using your superpower of hardened-drunk-white-guy-who-needs-a-drink (It's almost a little noir. Almost. Imagine Max Payne as a bush pilot, except without the writing and characterisation). The first thing that happens as you enter this apparently undiscovered world? A native steals your flask! You must give chase, the end to which is a stretched skin canvas with vague pictorial instructions drawn on it. The native who stole your flask is willing to trade it back to you if you find her... something? It was forgettable and largely irrelevant. I don't even care any more but I would sure love some of whatever was in that flask, I need to purge my memories of having tried this. I can't even be bothered writing anymore of this review. Oh my god it's awful. It is so bad, the crafting is pointless, the plot is lurid, the voice acting hammy with little to no characterisation to speak of in addition to the game largely just being offensive.I thought at ~$1.00 on sale I would receive a game that was playable, maybe a little fun and the bad reviews were hyperbole, but it is just tortuous and incredibly poor taste. The positives? The visuals really are quite good, like AAA quality, the games artists and visual designers should be applauded; it's such a shame they were wasted on such an incredibly poor title. Seriously, if the technical gameplay faults outlined in the other reviews aren't enough to steer you as far away from this title as possible then let these warnings guide you instead.Maybe next time I black out drunk I'll revisit this for some laughs and be able to pass out thinking that Day One is a metaphor for how every shiny promising thing that happens in life somehow turns to♥♥♥♥♥♥Now I must get back to writing my thesis, I can't even bear to use this for procrastination material.

												Absolutely the WORST game I've ever played. Unforgivably bad. I tried, I really tried to give this game a fair chance. I read bad reviews months ago, so I had hoped the bugs were fixed. I tried, but the game was so bad I only made it through about the first 5 minutes of the game (though it took about an hour of my time). The voice acting is terrible, for example, if you make a mistake crafting, the character spouts off a goofy ""uh oh!"" Also, why would anyone want to have an animation, complete with quick-time action events...for crafting. The amount of pop-in I experienced made me feel like I was in a laser light show funhouse, and environments were bland and boring. When I killed my first jaguar, it immediately disappeared, so I couldn't skin it and complete the mission. Worst of all, at one point, when I tried to load a save file, the ground wouldn't load. I'd be treated to 45 seconds of loading screen, followed by 2 seconds of falling into a gray abyss, then cue loading screen. The whole premise is campy and weird. And why are there guns randomly strewn about? Why is the player so slow? Why do the natives' clothes only load half the time? Bottom line: Don't buy this game no matter how cheap it is. It's not worth your time. "

												I wanted to like this game. I wanted to say the bad reviews are just because it's not that great... You start off. You have to kill a guy. The first fight in this game and the combat already feels boring and repettitive. After winning the fight Garry says ""Should I save her and risk my own life? Or leave her for her fate"" But, there's no way to save her.... Then, you're thrust into a puzzle, a very stupid puzzle that is written on a wall..... Then You find another 1 guy. A pistol and some weird alien thing that's completely unexplained. And Garry seems excited about it. Upon that part the temple caved in and I crouched into an area that I couldn't get out of. I crouched in that way, but could not get out. I fell into a pile of rubble and was stuck. Good game. At least it has cards I guess... RIP $2			"

												Through all of the graphical anomalies, uncomfortable silence, and the poorly written/acted dialogue, this feels like an early release of a free indie game you'd typically find on Indie DB or GameJolt. The atmosphere was completely unimmersive and boring. I felt no interest whatsoever in the story (if there even was a story) or the world. The biggest problem besides the awkward animations, both in cutscenes and gameplay, was the general randomness of the audio. During the first time I loaded the game, most activities in game, whether it be getting hit with projectiles, standard enemy sounds, and even player death, was met with an awkward silence. The second time I loaded the game, several more sounds came through, making me question if I may have missed them the first time. I don't think I did. I couldn't bear to play for very long, so I may have missed a major selling point of the game, but it'll be a while until I reinstall this one.I'm not sure what's worse: the game itself or the fact that it costs $10.

												Through all of the graphical anomalies, uncomfortable silence, and the poorly written/acted dialogue, this feels like an early release of a free indie game you'd typically find on Indie DB or GameJolt. The atmosphere was completely unimmersive and boring. I felt no interest whatsoever in the story (if there even was a story) or the world. The biggest problem besides the awkward animations, both in cutscenes and gameplay, was the general randomness of the audio. During the first time I loaded the game, most activities in game, whether it be getting hit with projectiles, standard enemy sounds, and even player death, was met with an awkward silence. The second time I loaded the game, several more sounds came through, making me question if I may have missed them the first time. I don't think I did. I couldn't bear to play for very long, so I may have missed a major selling point of the game, but it'll be a while until I reinstall this one.I'm not sure what's worse: the game itself or the fact that it costs $10.

												I must thank my greatest friend Tapparella for gifting this incredible game to me. I was sceptic about this at the very start, but reading the reviews confirmed that i was betrayed and the gift was not a game but a big pile of bugs and torment. After  more than 1 hour of gameplay my brain refused to go on. This is by far the best way to stop gaming and start thinking about your real life. What are you right now? what would you like to be?Thanks again to my friend Tapparella for gifting me with this, clearly a must play for the ppl that want to quit gaming forever. Too bad i will play till my last breath.2/10			"

												現状まとめ・グラフィックオプションは当初解像度だけだったけど、アップデートで追加された。（未確認）・クラフトは間違えてもアイテムはなくならないので総当りでおｋ、間違えたら「オッオー」・クラフトするにはQTEが必須例えば包帯を作るにはDとAを順番に押す、失敗すると布がどこかに消える。・その包帯を使うのもQTE、W連打、D、A、Sホールドとこれを使用するたびに繰り返す。・ちなみにパンサーに襲われてもQTE、そのあいだは無敵なので基本パンサーに殺されることはないがQTE中に集まってきた猿にタコ殴りにされて死ぬ。・戦闘も大味中の大味、棒立ちで殴ってくる敵を後退しながら殴るだけ。・銃もあるが拳銃が恐ろしく強い、パンサーなら一撃人間なら2発。・しかし人間は体に鉛でも仕込んであるのかと思うくらい頑丈で食らってものけぞるのみ。血とかは一切でない。・隠密も簡単である程度なら走ってもばれず、体が密着する距離で暗殺が可能になる。・その暗殺にはまさかのQTEがなく、アニメーションも木のなたをそっと押し当てるだけ。・売りにしているサバイバル要素も薄く最初につく村で釣り竿を作り、近くの川でサカナ釣ってそこの水を飲んでれば一生生活することが出来る。・一度作ったものは消耗品でない限り壊れることはない。・その魚釣りはマウスを動かして竿を移動させるとかの要素がなく、しばらく待ってSを連打するだけで釣れる。・物語性も皆無に等しいというか超展開で追いつけない。・主人公はなんか知らんが荷物を運んでいて、飛行機がなんかしらん力によって墜落して、なんかしらんが気づいたら生贄にされていた。・途中イベントがはさまるが、特になんも説明されずただ一枚の絵が表示されるだけ。・タイトル画面の音楽だけすごくいい。・進行不能バグ、死体消失バグ、透明なカベが生成されるバグなどバグだらけ。・一応fixされる予定らしい。・純粋に楽しくない。・Steamストア上でトレーディングカード対応と表示されているがバッジクラフト画面は存在しない、なのでもちろんカードはドロップしない。			"

												I do not recommend you play this game if you are one of those people that enjoys human psychology and interpreting the actions behind human behaviour and mankind as a whole, or one of those people that tries to avoid stabbing themself in the face with a spoon repeatedly; when possible. You will be thinking about this game for eternity, you will never quite understand why it was made, who they are working for in reality and their motives for not destroying it at birth. The main reason this game astounds me is because; every single person working for this company and every single person who worked on this game inparticular will forever be branded scammers, rip off merchants, jokers, etc, etc. It is an incredibly broken game that uses no intellect or creativity in any way whatsoever. This is the kind of game you purposely leave off your résumé on purpose and will more than likely haunt you in your sleep. There is absolutely no pride in this game, they did not make it with care or love, they churned it out as quickly as they could, with as little effort as possible. You will complete this game in 3-4 hours, and will get about 40 minutes of actual gameplay, the rest of the time will be spent dying to bugs, crashing, or any other number of technical difficulties, providing you don't pass out from shock whilst playing. Okay so, enough about the creation of the game, lets get into the main reason you shouldn't play this game. Do not buy this if you have any self respect for the gaming industry. What is released here is not okay, and the minute we start throwing money at companies like this for their half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempts at a game, is the minute we're doomed! I could completely respect these guys if they threw the game away, released it as a project or something else, or just wanted to 'test what they can do' - but they put a decent price tag on this at first, and it fails in every single way, it is borderline theft. Do what you want in your little studio, release things when you are ready, but do not pretend that this is a game, or a game that is ready. They released this knowing what it was and knowing it would receive such bad publicity, but they didn't care, providing they got a few bucks.For shame. For shame.			"
