												I'm so glad I played this. After becoming a CSGO/DotA Addict, THIS GAME re-kindled my love/passions for gaming..    + Amazing Story+ Amazing Soundtrack+ Non-Linear gameplay+ It's not frustating, not extremely challenging + Relaxing, Casual, Fun+ It's everything I want in a game. A game should be fun to play, something which you look forward to, which excites you even after a dull and tiring day.  - It's a little slow sometimes.Rating: 9/10If you're in my friends list and can't afford this game, i'll give you some bucks to buy this. BUT please do buy this game.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Hero of the Kingdom Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: RPG; Point & Click; Casual; Adventure My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-6 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Casual gamersREVIEWHero of the Kingdom is an interesting thing.  The game style blends elements of point-and-click adventure games, resource management/economy games, and role-playing games.  It is extremely casual (I don’t even think you can lose) and relaxing, but also is rewarding.  I can see how some people may find it monotonous, but I personally found it addictive and gratifying.First and foremost, I want to underline the casual and simplistic nature of this game.  I can appreciate an epic, immersive, huge-budget AAA title as much as the next guy; but I also really enjoy casual games for those moments when I want to get my Zen on and play something “lite.”  This game is great for that kind of situation… but if you are someone who prefers the AAA epics, Hero of the Kingdom likely won’t tickle your fancy.The game plays as a point-and-click adventure, essentially— with an inventory and a narrative.  In order to progress (i.e.: complete quests) you must pass inventory checks that determine if you have enough of specific items.  Thus, playing the game boils down to growing your inventory in two ways.  By finding camouflaged objects on the screen and clicking on them.  And by bartering with the NPCs; there are numerous profitable NPC-trading loops that can be used to make money and buy inventory items you need.The narrative is extremely light; there are very few total lines of text.  While it isn’t bad, it also is easily forgettable.  But it does a good enough job creating a feeling of advancement and incentive as you complete quests.  There are also a lot of well-spaced achievements (both in game and on Steam) that pop-up often to keep the game feeling rewarding as you progress through the campaign. For those who seek more intense gaming experiences, you may find this game somewhat tedious.  However, if you like tranquil, addictive games that are rewarding, there is a good chance you will enjoy Hero of the Kingdom.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Do you like clicking? No, do you derive intense pleasure from pressing a mouse button and watching numbers go up, for the sake of then being able to click a few more things and have those same numbers go up even faster?Hero of the Kingdom in almost every respect is a cleverly disguised iteration on the bizarrely addictive idle games that have been devouring souls since it was discovered people on the internet will do absolutely anything to pass time. The main change is that unlike Cookie Clicker or Candy Box, Hero of the Kingdom doesn’t run by itself and has a (mostly) definitive end, tapped together with what could almost be considered a story and some minor exploration.Beginning on a secluded farm, you take up the mantle of the world’s premier errand boy, poking your nose into everybody’s business in the hopes they’ll set you off on another menial task they couldn’t be bothered to do themselves.Hero of the Kingdom, in everything it does, is a personification of every tedious fetch quest you’ve ever done in an RPG, stripped of everything but finding and delivering the item and then being patted on the head and told you’ve done a great service to the kingdom.I don’t think developer Lonely Troops had any doubts about what they were making though, and have deviously engineered the perfect loop of turning mundane tasks into accomplishments. Thanks are given for every small deed you perform, unimportant numbers are always going up, and the achievements pour out like candy letting you know no matter how simple the job, you did a damn fine job clicking your way through it!And then before you know you’ve constructed a profitable trading cycle, picked the country clean of mushrooms, and risen up in the ranks to where no one would dare refuse your prying questions. Hero of the Kingdom would almost feel nefarious if it didn’t have a clear ending, so adept is it at roping you in and making it feel as if the entire game isn’t just cleverly disguised busywork requiring no skill and barely any effort.But for something that is fine letting you go after a few hours, I was fine indulging Hero of the Kingdom and its exploitation of a basic human need for self gratification. I don’t think it’s a good game, but it’s an easy way to waste some time that won’t hold you hostage past the point of some mindless fun (for lack of a better word).You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												This game was suprisingly a ton of fun. It's for a casual, laid back crowd. Pros: -Beautiful graphics-Most quests were self expanatory-Fighting style was fun, without being ""overdone""-Achievements really wern't hard to get-When replayed, maps were the same, but differences to what was found-SimpleCons:-Way too short for my taste, was hoping to dump more hours into it-Some of the items you need ""now"" for a quest aren't found until way later, had me stumped quite a few times-Achievements a bit too easy-No replayablity really.I would recommend this game to anyone whose laid back, wants a casual game that doesn't require a lot to do. Story line is easy to follow, good for kids. I recommend the Big Fish Gaming trial to check it out, if you're on the fence and not sure.			"

												With artwork reminiscent of games from the late 90's such as Age of Empires; Hero of the Kingdom is a point and click adventure game that takes you back to a simpler time when everyday heroes were larger than life. While the story itself is terribly cliche, the resource management is clever and has you dashing all over the countryside raising your own private army for the kingdom to fight off would-be invaders while the king and his generals sit back and bemoan the evils befallen their once peaceful kingdom. What I liked about the game:+ Visuals reminded me of good old Age of Empires 2+ The narrative isn't overly convoluted+ Flexible resource management, you can harvest your own or buy from the market+ Reasonable achievements+ Can be played causallyWhat I didn't like:- The story was terribly predictable and cliche as previously noted- Towards the end of the campaign the game gets rather repetitious; favoring quadrupling requirements rather than introducing new concepts			"

												I bought this game because it looked as it had a nice calm atmosphere. Its an easy-to-get-in-to point and clicker game in a medieval fantasy setting which you will play through in a day or two. Took me 6 hours to complete, and i was achievement hunting so dont expect a long story and the replay value of the game is close to zero as its going to be exactly the same. And you cant really fail in this game, its very much story driven by a somewhat unintresting story. I had a few nice hours with it though.			"

												I just finished Hero of the Kingdom (2.5 hours, give or take). It's a very unique game. Basically you're presented a top-down isometric screen that looks a little bit like Age of Empires 2 or HoMM3 or something. You click through text prompts on the screen in a sort of combination text adventure and hidden object game. You become a hero of your kingdom by moving through screens and helping people out. Maybe someone lost their son, so you hidden object find him. Nothing is difficult, it'll just be like you see a patch of mushrooms, and you click it so you get mushrooms added to your inventory. Or you are on your boat and click a barrel underwater to salvage it. So not really hidden object, more like click-to-acquire. Maybe a farmer needs someone to go to town to sell his flour, so you get flour, click to switch screens to the town, and sell the flour to a merchant. Your inventory has dozens of different types of commodities that you manage, flowers, eggs, swords, handymen, antlers, pearls, etc. Across the world various merchants buy and sell various commodities. There's no actual difficulty in that it seems like it's impossible to make a bad transaction. If you just keep buying and selling stuff and foraging and fishing and hunting you'll eventually get enough of what you need or enough money to buy what you need. I really can't compare it to any other game I've ever played. I had a fun time playing through it. I guess I wasn't really playing. Just kind of clicking everywhere.I also laughed every time I'd go into some big climactic battle and my guy would be like ""We scored a crushing victory over the Dark Goblins. Oh and all of my soldiers died. We will miss them."" and then -10 soldiers in my inventory. Hahaha. Made them feel very disposable.One flaw: The game autosaves and when you beat the game it erases your saves, meaning that if you want to get all the achievements you should do so BEFORE fighting the last boss (the last boss is clearly marked and identified).

												At first glance your average gamer might dismiss Hero of the Kingdom as an oddity, a curious game with minimal feedback and graphics and could be considered a time-filler, a placeholder title to play in between longer and more involved gaming sessions. To do so would be a disservice to the gamer and to Hero of the Kingdom, as there is a lot more under the surface than what first appears, and through the course of a short story, you will become, the Hero of the Kingdom.If you enjoy your gaming more casual, and less intense, Hero of the Kingdom definitely has a lot to offer. The game interface is simple and intuitive, and yet it is also never obtrusive. All gameplay is directed by mouse clicks. The action takes place on simple overhead maps, and your mouse clicks naturally will flow as the story and the gameplay layers on.The complexity of Hero of the Kingdom comes in its economy and the use of selling items of value or to trade for items of usefullness. Should your character require to pass a bridge that is broken, they may need to sell unrequired items to obtain the help, rope and other necessities to move further on. You will gain skills such as fishing and hunting, with simple mouse clicks taking all guess work out of the equation. You either have the equipment to do the task, or you don't. There really is no challenge here.This laid back notion is continued with the minimal music and sound effects. Both are equally pleasing, but ultimately forgettable. There is nothing about the game, from the gameplay, to the audio, that really stands out. It is all as inoffensive and flavorless as can be possible.In many ways, Hero of the Kingdom feels like a slightly improved Facebook game, without the social interaction. Certainly the gameplay harkens back to that mindset, and without any kind of graphical flourish, could easily be mistaken as one. Where it succeeds is that it layers on additional systems through hunting, fishing and flower collecting, while telling a simple story about a long forgotten evil that is uniting various minion cliches in order to hunt down the good people of the kingdom.Hero of the Kingdom is a fun diversion that requires so little of your attention and so little of the gamer that one could forget that they were actually playing a game here and not an interactive click-a-thon. There is enough gameplay here to recommend to the casual gamer but only to this subset of gamer might there be some enjoyment found. Hero of the Kingdom is by no means a bad game, in fact, I rather enjoyed my short four hour journey. But there are a great many alternatives for your gaming dollar that demand more from the gamer, and the gamer should demand more from the creator. Hero of the Kingdom wouldn't be out of place being hosted for free on some website, perhaps with a banner ad - there just isn't enough gameplay to fully justify a purchase.5/10.			"

												This is a nice little surprise for me. A cute and simple little game. It was fun from start to finish until i got all the achievements. This is more like a point & click game, but it has rpg and hidden object elements in it too. Oh that last mushroom...Your house has been burned and your father disappeared. You're going on a journey to find him. Collect flowers, mushrooms, fish, hunt the animals, help the ghosts, search for treasure, do quests and of course fight until you become a hero of the kingdom.			"

												Options include separate sliders for sounds, 10 languages to choose from, Full-screen or Windowed, and whether or not to use profiles (that's a new one to me!)Right away you'll see that you can access the main menu via the top right corner of the screen.  As you progress you'll end up with something in each corner, as follows:Hints - Bottom right cornerInsta-travel Map - top leftInventory and health - bottom leftWhat I really can't figure out is what kind of game this is.   I can't pigeonhole it in a single genre.  It has RPG elements, in that your character learns new skills and abilities as you progress; there are useful items scattered about on every screen, which is reminiscent of a hidden object game; and it's an adventure with strategy elements... What it's NOT is a click-fest.  There's no chaining, and no rush.As I mentioned above, some items just need to be clicked on, hidden object-style, something I didn't realized until about eight screens into the game.  ""I need (x-item), why can't I find someone to buy them from??""  The answer is that you need to gather them yourself.  New abilities will allow you to find new items in your environment, so you'll want to revisit scenes often, and be sure to click on anything that looks unusual!We lose energy (health) when we do tasks, and this energy can be restored by staying at one of the available camps.  At each camp you'll eat a different type of food before you go to sleep, and this means a varying amount of health restored.  At one point I had over 30 health, so I don't there's a cap on how much health you can have.Don't be thrown off by how easy everything is early on.  The game is pretty isometric when it first begins, but once you've explored a few screens, you start to have some freedom to choose your own tasks. Will you just chase the main storyline, or will you explore every nook and cranny and do all of the side-quests?  Will you try to get all 38 achievements, or only do what's necessary?  The choice is yours!  Once you finish the game, you CAN go back in to try and get those awards, which is really nice.Hero of the Kingdom which took me about 8 hours to finish with all of the achievements, and I absolutely enjoyed my time in the game.  Recommended!			"

												Hero Of The Kingdom is a casual game that's actually very relaxing while also being very fun. It uses an isometric 2D view with a bit of animation in there as well. The story isn't all that fancy, or important, but it fits the casual nature of the game.It's kinda hard to explain the gameplay because it involves a lot of clicking. You'll be accepting quests where you have to find certain items scattered across the map, defeat enemies, build things, sell things, buy things, you name it. There's plenty to do here, but remember, it's all about clicking stuff, so you will only use your mouse. Besides the isometric 2D view there's not much to look at. There are only textboxes and trade windows here. But this game is just so damn fun and addictive. It's no good for you if you suffer from OCD, because you will want to complete most of the stuff this game throws at you, it's *that* fun (but casual). Very enjoyable !Hero Of The Kingdom II is already in development and if it's nearly as good as this one I personally can't wait for it to come out.[Rating: 80/100]			"

												This is a game that feels like a mix between a hidden object game and a facebook-style RPG (follow very linear instructions, point and click on things to progress, rinse and repeat till you are done). Its a very casual game and moves at a fairly quick pace but would have preferred it to have been much quicker. Its a fairly mind-numbing game and while that can be ideal for some gaming sessions its a game that is very hard to recommend in most cases.Other then the normal progression achievements most achievements are tied to finding all of the games resources (which is the games ""hidden objects""). Most will be gotten easily but getting the eggs, mushrooms and lost crates can be quite an eye-torture to find due to how well they blend into the world. Time to 100%: 3½-5 hours			"

												This is a cute, casual point & click RPG, where the emphasis should be on the word CASUAL. That means no deep story, no fancy graphics, no complex battle-system. Having that said, by ""casual"" I don't mean ""dull"". Not on this case, anyway. :)In ""Hero of the Kingdom"" you follow a simple, somewhat childish story, where the gameplay consists of completing quests, gathering items and improving your skills, all by means of pointing and clicking with the mouse. Also, the game is pretty short - I beat it in 5 hours.Okay, so.... Where's the recommendation part? :PWell, the truth is, that despite the game's obvious casuality and simplicity, or maybe in a way thanks to those elements, the game *IS* fun to play. At least it was for me. I hear some people moan and complain that a game like this shouldn't cost money. Well, if that is what you think - don't pay for it, just pass on it and move on. Personally, I think paying $5-$6 for such a game is an okay deal. Obviously not a bargain, but not a bad deal either. Sometimes a game like this is exactly what I need to relax and unwind. If that's what you're looking for - Hero of the Kingdom is good for exactly that.			"

												Hero Of The Kingdom is an adventure point and click R.P.G. developed and published by Lonely Troops. You are the young son of a humble farmer and you're thoroughly enjoying your peaceful life of agricultural management until one day when malicious bandits suddenly raid your homestead and burn it to the ground. Worse yet your beloved father has also gone missing just as a darkness begins to fall over the entire kingdom. What's a boy to do...overcome his fear and set off for adventure on a dangerous journey to places unknown as you try to find your father of course!!! Hero Of The Kingdom does an excellent job of mixing multiple genres into one solid package...lite roleplaying, adventure, hidden object and point and click. This was my very first foray into a hidden objects game and I must admit that I rather enjoyed it. The visuals and animation are nicely done and fit the game perfectly. The title has a terrific soundtrack and the sound effects are fantastic as well. One downside, however, is the length of the title as I finished this game in under five hours but it was well worth the time spent. There are also some achievements to hunt for if that is your bailiwick.I was also pleasantly suprised to find out that there is a sequel available, Hero Of The Kingdom II, which I plan to play as soon as I pick up a copy. Anyone looking for a casual game that covers more than one base, genre-wise that is, would be remiss to give this little title a chance. I don't think you will regret it...recommended.			"

A ""clicker"" type of game as it should be made.It's about:boy saving his father from bandits;exploring, looking for adventures, reading and clicking (a lot).Why you should play this:unlike many other ""clicker""-games it's not linear and draggy:you not going from level to level cleaning them up one by one;you not clicking empty-headed all active objects around the area.instead, game offers the world divided on zones, which you need to explore, and light RPG elements:peasants ask for help, some of them later teach you some skills or become traders;you need to earn money and obtain different equipment for fighting, hunting, fishing, gathering etc.non-active, but collectable objects (eggs, mushrooms, lost crates) provide some sort of pixel-hunting making the game more various and gambling.simple, but interesting story;short-budget, but pleasant graphic style with authentic soundtrack (melodies change depending on location).Why you may not like it:it might seem to be too easy: you obtain fortune too soon and it's harder to find non-active collectable items than complete the main quest;it would be a nice idea to point out traders on global map, because on later stages it's not comfortable to remember who sells what.An evolution of ""clicker""-games, talented mix of point-and-click, light elements of RPG, strategy and management, covered with pixel-hunting - making all other games of this genre look obsolete and degenerative.

I can't find anything bad about it, it's very rewarding for the loot you can find and achievemens are not too hard to get, even if i finished the game before getting them all - but i really do not mind it.I bought this one on a bundle but i would recommend you to buy it even at full price, because it's really worth the money.

												A point and Click find and build game with a Really good RPG story flow...Above line is a bit complicated but this game is not complicated at all. You are a young lad that unwilling follow the flow of event of saving your father from bandit and eventually become the hero that saved your kingdom.Very easy to control. Very easy to understand. Very short game play. (2-4 hours). You need a sharp eye to find all the items and complete all the task you can complete. Most of the achivements are really easy.. but i cannot find the last mushroom and last treasure crate.. even afte spending 1 hours after completion of the game. I cannot find them.. so I have gave up on those 2 achievements. Those achievement however can be gotten though offline game play but they will all be time coded at same time when you go on steam online.Graphics are basic but beatifully done for indie development. 1-2 repeating played music with sound effect for each different task.. basic.. but effective and they are not bad to your ear.8.0/10 would be my final rating and I recommend your guys to play it.

												Although it took me just 3 hours to 100% this game I enjoyed every minute out of it.  It's a nice mix of hidden object game and adventure with a lot of trade and involved. It doesn't give any replay value though, so one shouldn't expect to get more than 4 hours out of the game. The difficulty is low at best. If you can get it cheap and you like adventures or hogs, then grab it. You will enjoy your time. Otherwise stay away.This game won't thrill you, but it manages to be both relaxing and yet always keep you entertained while you search for stuff hidden on the maps or think of strategies to get the items you need for your quest.a very well meant 6/10, I want to give so much more, but it's just not enough content and replay value.

												Quaint like an elderly lady's bungalow filled with many past adventures and expeditions, the attractively detailed land in Hero of the Kingdom possesses the old-fashioned quest-orientated method of play that I have yearned for through many wishful Steam purchases but had yet to truly discover until now.Hero of the Kingdom ranks highly in my gaming library as one of the most satisfyingly rewarding games I have played on Steam to date. It is most certainly one of the top 3 which I eagerly gave myself an auspicious pat on the back for buying. At $1.49 (75% off) it is money well spent. Completion only took me two days totalling 8 hours or so (didn't bother to quit game when taking dog for a walk). The game play is therapeutic and healing as even with a generic storyline, the long but seldom arduous line of quests are gratifyingly addictive. If you enjoy RPGs as I do and rarely skip side quests as it is half the fun, then I highly recommend this title. The controls are as easy as can be and I can't honestly admit this is a strategy game as it does not give the player a chance at failure as you will see if you play it. It isn't a game to test your gaming skills but a chance to relax from more demanding games. Out of games you can use to relax and enjoy like you used to enjoy games as a child, it never feels like a waste of time or is uncomfortable to play in terms of time or effort of lack thereof.  Hero of the Kingdom is my idea of a perfect holiday.When I first booted this game (being my silly little self) I truly believed, despite the title being ""Hero of the Kingdom"", that I would be taking care of Father's farm for the duration of the game play as the atmosphere was immediately soothing. Luckily, this tranquillity is carried onwards as there is no concept of time and you can go as expeditiously or leisurely as you fancy. ACHIEVEMENTS, GUIDES & TIPSDespised styles of achievements that I have become quite feverish about are those consisting of sending a player on wild goose chases where the goals lack relation to, or impact on the story. Luckily, this game is short, straight forward and sweet with every single achievement. You don't feel like you've wasted time getting achievements for the sake of achievements as it tend to be with some games which take away from the enjoyment. You will have to finish close to all of the activities provided in-game to finish all the achievements. I dislike looking at guides so am usually much slower than other players at finishing any set of tasks in-game but this game didn't need any guides at all. There are easier methods of finishing the game which you will eventually find out on your own but every feature and quest is well thought out by developers that you will not have to look at any playthrough or spend an exceedingly long time pondering variations of. Spoiler Hints (It’s likely you’ll realise on your own like I did so won’t need the info, hence the  format): You can buy grain, convert grain to flour, get bread from flour and sell that bread to a farmer's wife for minimum profit which will accumulate. Check this well written guide by The Fox in the community hub if you’d like to know more. When you progress farther and get to town you'll find a smuggler (in town to the right of screen with no indicating icon) which you can click on to buy poison from them, afterwards selling said poison to a master hunter in the woods also reachable at a later stage. This is a faster way of earning a profit through the market. The prices of items vary depending on who you're buying from/selling to, so keeping note of price ranges will add to the fun. When you start finding more treasure and jewellery which you can end up selling to one of the shops in town, you will no longer need to trade as much. Once you get to the ""let's hoard money"" part of the game which urges you to trade, it will ultimately feel less fun for obvious reasons (repetitive trading to add gold) so don't use it too much until you absolutely feel you need to.You will need to find a very small number of hidden characters that are in plain view, just without icons near them which you will have to manually activate (click on people and sometimes they'll talk back with no warning ;D ). There will be new items available to find across the map in the form of ""hidden objects"" so if you enjoy hidden object games, this will be a blast and quite easy. I have enjoyed my fair share of hidden object puzzles so it was extremely easy to keep an eye out for various types of items that I needed to find to finish achievements. It's different for each player but you may end up lacking 1 or 2 items of a kind etc and spend some time looking for them. This is only natural as it is with all hidden object games. The last or last couple you're looking for are hardest for you to spot which is why they'll end up the last ones. Don't fret and go through the map slowly a few times. Click on various areas that you'll become accustomed to as ""loot points"" on the map such as forests, cliff sides and lakes away from camps and village areas where people are stationed or reside in. It is definitely a game where you'd want to finish the achievements for the added content at least as the game itself is short. The challenges are not always a walk in the park especially if you do not use the easier trading methods for extra gold but you will undoubtedly complete them like the way a fantastic game like this should be played. Btw, the blacked out parts are spoilers, not cheats as they do not exist and are thankfully unnecessary in this game (not that any should ever be used for any game). I do not finish any of my games quickly so the fact I finished it in two days adds to the realisation now that it was neither tirelessly demanding nor boring enough to put aside for a while like the majority of my library. It was such a simple yet entertaining 8 hours that I started writing this review after I finished it which also says a lot about how much I enjoyed the title considering my crowded backlog of games awaiting review (the majority of which I evidently did have fun playing). When the words ""The End"" reached my screen, it crossed my mind that this game felt like a demo for it's sequel, Hero of the Kingdom II. That's how much I enjoyed it and how much I am ready for more.- Edited grammar "

												Excellent little casual game... Well, by casual I mean the kind of harmless game you play until 3am without realizing. Thank you guys for ruining my Saturday night.Just some quick thoughts...Endgame becomes a bit of a clickfest where you're just trying to find hidden pixels to get the last few achievements, but that's only a problem if you're a completionist like me.Story is clichéd, but it was decently written for this kind of production. Everything is pleasing really, from the music to the graphics. I didn't think I could play a game where the hero is nowhere to be seen on the screen, but hey, it happens.There isn't much of a RPG aspect, it's more about managing resources and trying to remember where you can sell and buy your stuff.

												Nice casual game containing a bit of resource management, a bit of hidden treasure hunting, a simple fantasy story and covers everything in graphics similar to older HoMaM games. It's not challenging by any means (I think you cannot die). But if you don't exect much, you can be surprised that it's not as shallow as it seems on first sight. Note: It's very possible to get 100% achievements in one gameplay, if that's your thing. Would I recommend it? Free, bundles, less than 3$ ? - Yes. 5$ - well.. are you sure you have nothing better & deeper to play? more than 5$  - probably not. It's casual, you finish it in couple of hours and there is no reason to replay it.			"

												This game took me by suprise, as I wasn't expecting it to be what it actually was.  This game is simple, and a child could do it.  That being said, this game also does somthing weird to your brain.  You just have to read the texts as they appear on the screen, and the game draws you in.  once in a while you even catch yourself thinking ""this game is stupid why am I still playing it?""        For me, honestly, I liked the game for it's rather relaxing pace.  I would recomend this game to other casual gamers and people who have children.  I have a Nephew who is a teenager who lives with me, and he hates this game.  he thinks all games that aren't COD Black OPPS, Halo, or Mortal Kombat, suck!   I think this just isn't a game for a hardcore gamer, cause me and my wife both love it.			"

												A strategic resource management, progressive hidden object game with a much used fast travel map and a viewable achievement list directly off the inventory scene.  Hardest achievement to earn: 5000 gold in inventory, but that is where strategy and some grinding/ farming can come in handy. (There are a couple of ways to farm in this game though it is not really necessary unless one wants to earn lots and lots of gold early in the game but it will be tedious to do.)Storyline: Father leaves son at home on their farm.  Dad will be back in a week.  Day after he leaves bandits attack, burning all to the ground.  Intrepid son leaves home to catch up with dad, only to discovery dad's wagon has been attacked (by the same bandits the son suspects) and dad is no where to be found, alive or dead.  Hearing rumors dad was taken captive the son decides to find and rescue his father.  Once that decision is made the epic journey begins.  Along the way the son meets people, helps them, earns gold, learns skills and eventually rescues dad.  But wait that is only half way through the game.  The son learns about his father's past, his connection with the Kingdom's King, and how dark forces are once again trying to take over their peaceful Kingdom.  Good thing the son joined the army and made lots of friends because he has to finance this little venture of defeating the rogue wizard who now calls himself, the Dark Lord.  (Is there any dark wizard who does not call himself ""Dark Lord"" I wonder?) Gameplay: Easy to understand icon driven quest adventure, and no actual swashbuckling fighting with controller or keyboard. (No frowning by those who are good at such melee combats.)  This game is more point and click without all the puzzle elements.  Every available thing to do in any area has an icon attached to it.  Need potions, look for the vial and have the asking price ready.  Need to gather flowers, a basket or sack plus a scythe is needed.  Need to fish, bait and fishing pole.  Talk to people with a speech bubble or exclamation mark.  Combat (for the frowners out there) is simple.  Buy the soldiers, weapons, healing potions, or whatever the icon indicates one needs then click the crossed sword icon when ready.  Swords clash, combat sounds, visual advance of the combat group, guaranteed win.  However the player will lose people, equipment, and any potions brought along.  It is very realistic in that way.Okay seems easy enough, but a lot of resource management strategy is involved.  Gold until the very end is not something one ever has a lot of, even in the end one may not have a lot.  Everything costs something, and there is a barter of goods for other goods or sleeping accommodations to replenish one's health.  People, however, all cost money, and soldiers cost the most and one will need lots of them.  The strategy of the game comes with the resource management of buying just what one needs and possibly a spare for certain things that are used a lot.  The idea is not to accumulate items but to gather and sell the extra.  One needs that gold for something else always, like learning to hunt better, buy the services of workman, equipment, supplies or funding an army.  Talking to people and doing mini-quest tasks is another money maker though in some cases an investment of supplies is needed.  One may talk to someone and know the task long before one is able to complete it.  Fortunately those people retain an exclamation point over their head until the task is complete.  However there are people without exclamation marks or icons over their heads, so people standing around alone somewhere might actually have a task for one to do or be someone one is looking for.  This in an odd way leads us to the ""hidden object"" part of this game.  There are lots of hidden objects, eggs, lost crates and barrels, treasure, even a person or two to name some.  (See the achievement list found on the inventory screen for everything.)  First of all, the hidden objects are progressive.  What I mean by that is when one starts out there are no lost crates or barrels, but as one progresses in the game and learns new skills not only do new icons show up but more hidden objects show up too.  Certain things like golden eggs or treasure do not show up until one talks to the Master Hunter.  Or pearls when one pays to learn new skills from the Master Fisherman.  Basically hidden objects can show up again in a location that one has already scoured for objects.  I would guess after each new icon that appears like ones for flowers, fish or hunting a new set of hidden objects appear or anytime a new skill is learned.  Many of hidden object crates or barrels are submerged in water so look close and click on anything that looks promising.  If one plays on a small screen this might be a problem, the objects are small (or actually relative is size to the world they are in).  Eggs are found in bird's nests. A bird nest's in real life is small so a bird nest in this game having the same proportion to its world is tiny.  It is white which makes it easier to spot.  Mushrooms are small too and 4 different types eventually show up.  So the hidden object elements are progressive and show up as the story progresses so go back to every place and look for any new items.                    Overall, easy to play, simple to understand, relatively fast paced adventure quest storyline with side tasks to do (people and ghosts), lots of hidden objects to find, with some basic strategy and money/ resource management involved.  Can often be found on sale, in bundles, or on give-away sites.  Well worth the play.			"

												Short, casual, relaxing game. It's like reading some children's booklet with a fantasy story inside, though bit more interactive of course, with some point and click adventure/hidden object gameplay. You go around, talk to people, do quests, trade resources (food, ingredients, gold etc. including bit more abstract resource like strength), push story forward, though generally don't strain yourself much as the player.Don't expect replay value or any challenge besides some pixel hunting for last few 'shrooms or crates if you want 100% the game. But it brought me to a happy place for a few hours :)			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a very simplistic point & click pixel hunt adventure game.  All of the dialogue is written, and not spoken, so be prepared to do a bit of reading.  The story is pleasant, but rather unexciting.  The overall game is very easy as I had all achievements unlocked in under three hours.  Still, it was a nice distraction for about three hours.

												This is a different kind of adventure game. Instead of hacking and slashing your way through the world, you become a hero by doing quests and tasks for others. A lot of the time, bartering with other NPCs is the way through an area, or gathering herbs for a master herbalist. You have to purchase the sacks, baskets, fishing rod and bait, etc, but it's fascinating to play. I sat down for a good couple of hours, just absorbed in the gameplay. Also, the following stunned me: It made me think about what we define as a hero. Is it only a chap in armour, slashing his way through the countryside? Or can it mean someone who improves the areas he travels through in a constructive, helpful manner? You are a communicator, a problem solver, the solution to social problems. I'm either very tired or this game got under my skin in a good way.It's not the longest game, but I don't think it has to be (look on the forums if you want to know how long a playthrough lasts, I haven't finished it yet). It's genuinely fun, and a breath of fresh air from the usual 'kill everyone you meet' kind of games. It's also the first game in a long time where I'm looking forward to a sequel. and after Thumbs up!			"

												For such a casual, simple, and easy game that's seemingly tailored towards young adults with regards to the writing, this pixel-hunt adventure with the visual trappings of an RPG is oddly addictive. The game takes place in a medieval fantasy kingdom, with a prerendered set of locations that you interact with using the mouse (your player avatar is never actually represented on-screen). You can perform actions such as fighting, collecting crafting materials, trading with merchants, and hunting for hidden loot. The ultimate goal being to get powerful enough to fight an evil lord endboss. Chris Avellone levels of storytelling, it is not. But there's something about the game's simplicity and steady stream of medal unlocks that's strangely appealing. Worth giving a try, especially if you bought it as part of a certain indie bundle...Completion time: 4-5 hours to 100% achievements			"

												Hero of the Kingdom quickly became one of my favorite chillout games ever. Part adventure game, part trading game, part hidden object game, it has a simplistic charm and a complete lack of urgency that makes it a joy to fool around with.You play as some hapless farm kid whose father goes off to market. Bandits burn your farm down and kidnap Dad so its up to you to journey all the hell over the kingdom to save him. This involves a bit of fighting and a lot of trading goods, building things, and helping the mostly useless peasants out with their problems. The game plays out on static screens that look rendered right out of the Stronghold HD engine. New things to do appear as golden icons and can be anything from talking to people, hunting wildlife, gathering herbs, camping, scouting, battling, and so on. Every activity has a requirement in terms of energy (replenished by sleeping), gold (earned from jobs and such), and items found or bought. There are no time limits, no RNG, and every trade seems to at least break even for you, so there's no way to fail anything.There's a huge amount of stuff to do as you progress, because you can earn yourself new skills that give you access to new activities. There's also a hint of hidden object game to it, because each screen has little collectibles like eggs and crates to click on for bonus resources. You can hunt for lots of ""secrets"" in the game that take the shape of items, quests, and even hidden parts of the map. It's not a terribly long game, maybe 3 hours or so to beat, but if you want to go completionist on its many achievements you'll get another few hours out of it. Hero of the Kingdom was a perfect way to wind down between more involved games and I'm definitely going to pick up the sequel sometime.Oh, and there's a demo if you're still on the fence after reading this. But come on.			"

												I wish there was a neutral selection.  Because that's really how I feel about this game.I don't hate it, but it really isn't very interesting either.  I don't mind the almost entire lack of graphics - graphics in the game pretty much consists of still painted scenarios.  But there is really very little going on in the game.  Oh sure there are step-n-fetchit ""quests"", but the game is so entirely linear that its like reading a choose-your-own-adventure that somebody else has already gone through, and you have to follow in their footsteps.  There is really very little choice in the game.Also this is THE GRINDIEST game I have ever had the misfortune to come across. One of the major flaws in this game (so far) is that you are constantly being given ""quests"" that you have to spend your own money on - of which you have very little.And more often than not, these quests don't even make sense.  For example, once you join the army, you are given quest after quest that requires you to go out and hire workers, hunters, and soldiers, and buy materials, weapons, and supplies, to perform tasks for the army - and you are expected to pay for ALL of this out of pocket.In what army are the privates and new enlistees expected to pay their fellow soldiers to do the jobs those soldiers joined the army to do, such as fight battles with goblins and bandits?  And in what army do enlisted personell go to the armorer and then have to PAY for their weapons, supplies, and armor?While there are mushrooms to pick and sell, and fish to catch, etc, these items quickly disappear and then you have to wait a long time for them to respawn.  So you can't really forage your way to wealth.The only way I've found to make enough money to do the quests is to literally grind - grain into flour, then take the flour back to the baker and trade it for bread, then take the bread into town and sell it at the inn.  And you have to do that a looooooong time, over and over and over again, as you are only making a little over 1 gold per loaf.  Some of these early quests take THOUSANDS of gold worth of materials and hired help.  And you can't ""sell all"" - you have to click to sell each individual loaf of bread.  I literally have spent hours reading a book with one hand and methodically clicking over and over again to make enough money to do the stupid quest that I shouldn't have to pay for anyway because its the armies job in the first place.  What IS the general doing with all that money he gets from the royal exchequer?  He's sure not spending it on personell or supplies.Overall I'd not recommend this game.  People complained about Titan's Quest being too linear - they should take a look at THIS one.  This has got to be The Definition of a linear game.Grind grind grind.  And then virtually no choices anyway.  I don't see the point.Also - the main character (who you are following around throughout the game) is pretty much of a jerk.  He self-proclaims his own heroism every time you turn around.Actually, the more I think about it, I would not recommend playing this game even if you got it for free.  Guess I'm not so neutral after all.			"

												This is a very casual game, but very enjoyable and quite addictive.There wasn't anything in the game to ruin what it was. I thought it might be ruined at the first battle by going in to a dumb mini game or something, but it stays true to itself the whole way through, and doesn't ever try to be anything that it's not, which I really appreciated.You buy or trade items for quests, you can trade items for cash. To get your health back up, you can camp if you have certain food, or pay cash for a room. There's stuff to collect, and hidden objects, hunting, fishing, herbing. All of which fit the mood of the game perfectly.I bought this in the steam summer sale, but given what £5 will buy you elsewhere these days, I'd say it's probably worth it's full price.I don't think there's much replay value to it, but it's entertaining and addictive enough to keep you going till the games end without getting bored.All achievements are do-able on one playthrough, just check to see what you need to complete, and you won't have to play it twice, which I also appreciate, especially since it's story based, I don't like to feel forced to play a game twice if there's no real replay value, just for achievemements, so it's great in this regard as well.

												For a mere 10 cents I spent on this game (from Indie Royale bundle), it's a neat one.Game's incredibly simple, a point and click with RPG and hidden object element. You won't be hard pressed by timer to complete quest, can be done at your pace. There's a grinding involved to get gold, and admittedly it's a bit boring to do quest repeatedly but I think it's a minor problem in a bigger picture. Basically it's just collecting resources like meat, flavor, fish, gold etc and turn them in for rewards and next objectives. You'll also be looking for some items in your screen and click on it to get the items (hidden object element). Overall mix, it's pretty fun. Story is so so, a boy that is gonna save the country from Evil invasion. I breezed though the dialogues anyway... moreso, The Ending is a mere 'horrayyyy for the hero' and just like that.Replayability... none. Beat it once and ain't gonna look back. To complete the game it won't take long, three or four hours you can do that. Maybe six or a bit more to fully complete achievements - I can't be bothered to do that though.Overall, for a bundle game, this one has a good value. Recommended 7.5/10.			"

												Very small and simple, but charming game with relaxing gameplay and beautiful art style. You move from one screen to another, interacting with characters, accomplishing quests and gathering various resources all over the map.Story is simple and naive, but there lies its charm. Young man, whose farm was burned by bandits, is trying to take revenge on this thugs and find missing father. This story offers no surprises, but develops logically and well designed.There is open world, you can more or less freely move around the map. On the other hand, the world is very small and it is impossible to get lost here. Quests do not shine with diversity, they just fit into formula ""find something somewhere and bring it for someone"". There is no variations in dialogues and you can not choose answers of your character, events are completely linear. But, as i said, story is well designed, it is interesting enough to follow the storyline and completing the quests gives you a nice feeling of progress.There is a lot of quests and sometimes i really missed something like journal where it would be possible to see the list of active quests and their description. On the other hand, as i said, the map is small and you can walk through locations in seconds so, if you forget what people asked you to bring, it is not difficult to find active characters again and re-check what you need to do.Sometimes, game lacks logic. For example, to kill a boar you need a dagger. You do not have a dagger but have a sword and bow with arrows? Well, then you can not kill the boar, go and find yourself a dagger. Why i can not hunt this poor pig with arrows? Game offers no answer.Eventually, your character will learn skills to collect pearls, hunt wild animals, gather algae and so on. There is plenty of hidden items that can be collected and sold to merchants - eggs, mushrooms, treasures, crawfish... all this objects are very small and usually are well hidden, so gathering turns into annoying and merciless pixel-hunting. This is bad for eyes for sure! Fortunately, if you do not want to complete all achievements then it is not necessary to seek for hidden objects.There is no way to lose the game, i just can not invent a situation in which you can get stuck. Abundance of resources means that you will always find something that you can sell and earn some coins. Storyline can be completed in four or five hours but, of course, if you want to collect all the mushrooms, then pixel-hunting can detain you for long. After you had finished storyline, you can continue to play and solve incompleted quests and achievements. But there is no random events, enemies and resources do not respawn, so game offers no replayability.Anyway, game is very well designed and i can safely recommend it to anyone who seeks for relaxing and casual gameplay. Hidden gem. Very small and inexpensive gem, in fact. But still a gem.			"

												This game is a Point&Click adventure where you wear the shoes of a young farmer, who eventually leaves the nest in search of something more, fighting dangers and paving he's way to the success.The basics of the game are: every action you do consumes energy, you gain energy resting, you can rest if and only if you have food. Plain simple. You can acquire food by harvesting it or buying it, same way you can acquire many usable objects.I had fun playing it, even though I will never play it again.The full price is 5,99€, and I find it quite expensive, considering what digital delivering can sell us nowdays, for the same amount. This is a very casual game, with a decent plot and a good variety of tasks to go through. However, there isn't much to do other than completing the main quest: while there will be many possibilities to gain extra rewards, each of these isn't very satisfying, nor will take us occupied more than few minutes.Acceptable sound and graphic department, nothing remarkable or despicable regarding the gameplay.Buy it if you're a casual gamer, and aged gamer who wishes something calm and relaxed, or if you just prefer games where reflexes don't matter.At the end of the day, I recommend Hero of the Kingdom because I could see the developer(s) have made an actual effort to polish the game: there is a decent amount of graphic options and a good autosave feature, which will come in handy whenever the game will crash because of some incompatibility with the Steam Overlay (Writing the review in April 2015, I played it a month ago).If you need ratings:Graphic: 6/10Sound: 7/10Longevity: 4/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall: 6/10			"

I finished the game in around 5 hours and might have tried to go for completion if not for one HUGE problem. After you finish the game it starts you over from the beginning of the story. So you have to go through all the gathering of resources and story items all over again. It has only one save slot which autosaves your progress. This is just UNFORGIVABLE in this day and age. At least let the player start at the last autosave before fulfilling the ending condition. "

												If you know what you are getting into with this game, I think it hits all the right notes.  It's basically a point and click adventure game, but instead of puzzles, you have resource management.  You find/collect various resources in the world and use them to create/craft/barter for other items that may not be as easy to come by.  As the story progresses (a simple story, old as time, but it moves things along), you open up new areas of the map in which to hunt, forage, and take on side quests for various NPCs.  All of the backgrounds are static, with icons representing the types of activities available - picking flowers, hunting bear, fishing, and combat animations are little more than a few 2D sprites wobbling back and forth.  But that doesn't detract from the enjoyment.  There is just enough of a ""new stuff to get/see"" drip, and the pacing is done well enough, that it never gets boring.  You may find a vendor selling things you don't know what to do with yet, but it won't take long until you figure it out, or the story progresses to the point where it makes sense.  There is a bit of a grind at the end of the game if you want all the achievements, but it's not a big deal.  The major story beats are advanced by having the right amount of particular resources - soldiers, healing potions, a weapon of some sort - to take on the battle or quest in front of you.  Sometimes, finding the right resources is a little troubling because the map doesn't identify where anything particular is; however, the loads are fast enough, and you backtrack enough that you get used to where the crucial stuff is anyway.  It has a demo, so I'd check that out.  It hooked me and I ended up getting all 38 achievements (most of which can easily be done by playing through it).			"

												Completed the game with 100% achievements.About the gameBefore I say anything else, I'd like to point out that this IS a clicking game. Although it wasn't mentioned in the tags it kinda fits that genre very well. So if you don't like clicking don't get the game and save yourself from posting a rant.The story starts with the life of a boy living a peaceful life in their farm. But, things starts to get chaotic when your father went missing and your house being burned down to nothing leaving you homeless. Now the boy must embark on a journey to find his missing father and find out the cause of the attack. You will be meeting different people from small villages along the way and experience the life of a traveler as you earn fame and make a name for yourself.My thoughtsThe game is overall fun. It is mainly about resources management and will make yourself analyzing and thinking but not to the point of frustration. There will be plenty of items in-game:this includes item such as food, weapons, crafting materials, and more. Acquiring items are earned by either completing tasks given by the NPCs or bartering with merchants. This works by giving a certain item from your inventory in-exchange of another of the same value. Ofcourse, the game also has a currency which will be a necessity later on. There's nothing much to say about the game except for the fact that if you're not into too much action and just want to sit down and play relaxing game yet entertaining then, you should give this a try. --- This paragraph might contains minor spoilers. But, I'll put it here anyway for people who wants to know what to expect from the game. ---The game starts with a realistic story of a young boy as stated above. But, things get weird when you suddenly need help of mages from the guild who *obviously* can use magic. You'll start getting items that is related to alchemy too and you will have to fight fantasy-ish creature not much like at the beginning where you only fend off wolves.Now this may come a surprise to some people but it can be either looked at as positive and negative. I was expecting the game to be realistic until the end when the boy matures enough. Instead, it turned out that the entire plot of the story revolves around a certain wizard and it gets cliche from then on.--- End of potential spoiler paragraph ---RatingGameplay: ★★★★☆Graphics: ★★★☆☆Story: ★★☆☆☆Sounds: ★★★★☆Average: ★★★☆☆			"

												I enjoyed this little game quite a lot. It was fun doing all the missions, the songs are nice, and it was challenging finding all the tiny items in order to reach 100% of the achievements. A casual point-and-click game to play and relax for a few hours!6/10 because I wish it was longer. I can’t wait to play the second game! =)			"

Hero of the Kingdom is a medieval fantasy adventure game. After your farm got burned down by bandits, you set out to find your father, helping people across the kingdom and becoming the adventurer you always dreamed of being.Pros: This game is a light straightforward adventure. Each quest or encounter requires you to assemble a certain amount of money or equipment to accomplish. As you successfully accomplish goals, additional parts of the maps are revealed, allowing you to go to new location and get additional quests. You also advanced through three level of hunting, fishing and gathering skills, each stage revealing new quests or resources on the map, giving you a reason to go back to locations you didn't need to access anymore.Cons: The entire game is a linear adventure, save side quests. If you have the required quantity if weapons, items or troops for a combat, you will win that combat, no action or strategy involved. The game is void of randomization: people are there where they're supposed to be, resources can be gathered once or twice and do not regenerate, enemies or hunting game don't respawn. There is no replay value to this game.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youHero of the Kingdom is simple, straightforward, and short. Surprisingly, I almost played through the entire game in one sitting (it wasn't intense enough to keep me up at night, but I finished it the following morning). It's a fun little idle game with just enough production value to mandate it's rather low price. It barely gets my recommendation, but it does get it.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Hero of the Kingdom is a pretty solid adventure/very light RPG hybrid. It's a bit odd to describe it, as the game wants to seem like an adventure but it comes out as something fairly unique. You start as a simple farm lad trying to find where your father went off to after bandits ransacked your farm, and end up being, as the title says, the hero of the entire kingdom.To achieve this end result, you must click, and click, and click! This can be from anything as simple as delivering a letter from clickable person to clickable person #2 to defeating various armies of villainous foes by gathering troops and supplies. There's also objects in the background that, when clicked upon, give various items relating to what they are. These can be very helpful for trading for what you need or selling to get extra gold, though none of them are necessary typically and are just there to make the game last longer.Speaking of length, it took me 3.3 hours to beat the game, including all my clicking of the extra objects (of which I got about 95%). I was somewhat annoyed to find that I couldn't go back and clean up the last few objects I needed once I had beaten it, but this will only affect you if you're a completionist or achievement hunter. If you are, just be wary of that.The story is very basic of course, even just basing it on the summary I gave, but it's a quaint little adventure-sorta game. At $7 (and cheaper on sales presumably), this is a nice choice for an interesting game to check out.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is something new for me... It is, technically a very simple adventure game with hidden object ideas, dressed up as RPG, with very cheesy fantasy RPG story.You ""walk"" through different screens, finding hidden things and doing quests for which you usually just need to click on something, you earn money to buy stuff needed to complete other quests. There is neither luck nor skill involved, you just click through things in some order, uncovering a story in a nicely drawn world.If you have a few hours of your time to kill, and you really don't want to use your brain at all; It is a nice little adventure game that looks nice and in the end, makes you feel nice... At least for finishing all the achievements... :)6/10 Recommended, but not for everyone...			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a neat little Point and Click game that combines the classic Hidden Object genre with some light RPG elements, quests and resource management. The game was developed by Lonely Troops, a Slovakian Indie studio consisting of 2 brothers.STORYWithout going too much into detail, the story is pretty generic weak-boy-saves-the-world material. Bandits burn down your house and kidnap your father, so you set out on a quest to rescue him, find out what the bandits' motives are and put an end to all evil to make the kingdom a peaceful and safe place again. Add magic, ghosts, talking frogs, goblins and lizardmen to that and, well, there you go. Nothing spectacular or innovative there, but gameflow-wise it keeps the boat afloat, so that's at least something.VISUALSGraphically, the game may as well be from the 1990's era of simulation games such as Anno 1602 or Age of Empires, which isn't a bad thing at all. The enviroments have loads of details that you often only see at a second glance and it's quite cool to discover new things in areas that you have already visited many times. However, do note that the enviroments are absolutely static - they are basically drawings with quest/action markers on top of them, so you won't see cows eating grass, fishes swimming around or anything like that. The best you get is some minor animation effects for water and smoke, but that's about it. If anything changes in the enviroment like, say, a NPC is moving from A to B, he slowly fades out on A and then slowly fades in on B, so there aren't any actual animations for anything. While that's no deal-breaker for me personally, it surely would've been awesome if the game felt a bit more alive and actually more like a sim rather than a P'n'C game with rendered backgrounds.GAMEPLAYThe game is basically a Hidden Object game where you can freely move around between the various locations to explore them and hunt, collect and harvest goods that you'll eventually need for quests, trades or tasks. All items that you gather will be put into your inventory and you decide whether you want to sell them for gold or trade them for other items that you might need for a certain quest.All interactions such as hunting, fishing, harvesting or fighting cost resources in the form of knifes, arrows, bowls, fishing rods, swords, shields etc. and if you have a bow but no arrows, you can't go hunting. While the various tasks require various resources, all tasks require a certain amount of health points (similar to Action Points in turn-based games). They basically represent your stamina and if you have depleted your health, you can't finish any tasks until you replenish it again. This is easily done by taking a nap in a tent, camp or inn. The different resting places require different resources: while you need fruits or meat to sleep in a tent or a camp, you need hard gold to sleep in an inn. In return, you get rewarded with the most health points out of the 3 resting places because it's more restorative to sleep in an actual bed rather than in a tent, obviously.Generally, managing your resources is an important part of the game as you need to think ahead and estimate whether you might need certain items later down the road. If you sell everything right away, you most definitely will have to re-purchase the items in order to complete tasks or quest. On the other hand, if you keep absolutely everything in your inventory, you might not be able to purchase required items that are only sold for gold - simply because you didn't earn any gold by selling stuff you do not need.Other than that, it's basically back and forth tracking between the different locations to look out for new or updated quests and new activities, which often only spawn after certain quests are completed.PLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITYBeating the story took me roughly 5 hours, however, the largest chunk of playtime is dedicated to finding the large amount of hidden objects/resources and doing various tasks to gain even more resources. The actual story itself makes only a small piece of the pie.For me personally, the game has only very little replayability. Once you've beaten it, you've beaten it. There's no real point or incentive to come back to it again, especially since it's easily doable to get 100% of the achiements in a single playthrough if you just take your time and don't rush from quest to quest.CONCLUSIONHero of the Kingdom isn't flawless, but the visual appeal, the relaxing atmosphere and the simple yet interesting gameplay makes this a decent game for a casual evening when you're not in the mood to shoot and kill things on the screen.

												I got this game in a bundle and originally had it in my trades list, however, I decided to give it a try because I needed a mindless, time-filler in between games. I was pleasantly surprised by Hero of the Kingdom, and was happy to have given it a chance.If you like super casual, short, adventure games that are less action-oriented (the game's main mechanic is item/resource management), then you will enjoy this game. It is easily beatable in less than 2 hours, and within 4 hours I had farmed all of the achievements. The aesthetics are nice - the backgrounds are well-done and the menus/feedback are non-intrusive. The music and sounds are good, adding an appropriate feel to the atmosphere. The story and pacing of the game allow for a very mindless, non-taxing gameplay experience. After playing through a lot of time-intensive, mind-numbing games, having casual alternatives like Hero o the Kingdom is always appreciated.The controls are extremely simple, as everything is done through mouse clicks. The tutorial is quick and painless, and the learning curve is mostly minimal - the most difficult element being proper item/resource management. It is pretty challenging to actually ""fail"" in the game, as there are always options for you to acquire more resources, even if you find yourself suddenly depleted of everything.Gameplay is mostly linear and follows a straightforward formula - in order for you to progress to area X, you need items Y and Z. Item Y can be obtained by either buying it directly with gold, or by harvesting and crafting components A and C, Item Z is a side-quest reward. Variations of this formula occur, but the general concept is to have the appropriate items for each mission. Any form of resource harvesting (ex: farming, hunting) requires health points (and usually some other item(s)), and you are able to accumulate an infinite amount of HP if you keep resting. For achievement hunters, this game is pretty easy to achieve 100%, however, a large amount of time will be spent finding small objects (mushrooms, crates, etc) on the screen. I had to do this in bursts, as my eyes and brain would get tired of searching through each level.If you want a casual, non-demanding break from your typical games, then definitely give Hero of the Kingdom a try. I've played web-based games on sites like Newgrounds and Kongregate since I was a child, and this game has similar appeal as the quality titles you can find on there. I normally try not to mention game price in my reviews, however, I would recommend most people to wait for this one to go on sale, or at least be bundled (as it happens often).Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												The only reason I say no is because it is not worth the price tag. You can clear the entire game, going for all achievements, in 3 hours. It's not a bad game, a little fun, but it's a very strictly linear game. No deviation from the storyline. No side quests, no way to change the ending, you just do a lot of clicking and searching for small, nearly-unnoticable items. It's kinda fun, and a way to kill time for a little bit, but if you see it and think it's a multiple playthrough game don't bother. If you see it on sale, at least half-off, I'd say it's worth that. But full price? Nope. It is a very short game, with a very set storyline, your actions do not change the ending. And I found that to be really disappointing. It was like a book you click through.

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  At its core Hero of a Kingdom is just a clicker game but unlike most is actually pretty darn fun, the story isn’t anything to write home about but it’s good enough to keep you interested.  Can be easily completed in one sitting (about 4-5 hours)If you enjoyed this one I highly recommend getting the second part, story wise they aren’t connected at all so you can also jump straight to 2 without worries. Español:  Hero of a Kingdom es un simple juego de administrar tus recursos, encontrar objetos escondidos y hacer click en la pantalla como un degenerado. ¿Suena aburrido? La verdad que sí, sin embargo el juego tiene un carisma y un encanto bastante particular. Las altas calificaciones en Steam lo demuestran. Esperando ansiosamente una nueva entrega.			"

												Never saw this little gem coming at all - It sure did surprise me very well. Game is often offered as some left over in game bundles. I have not even bothered to look at the trailers. 'Adventure' 'rpg' says two of the descriptions - oh really? Graphically screenshots looked more like left overs from age of empires. Wrong - this game is 'hidden object hunting combined with strategy'. It also neatly re-defines what or who a hero is. In this game the hero is not a guy in shining armor being all angsty and killing eveything - instead he is a crafty man who hauls♥♥♥♥♥around the map and does chores, builds stuff, helps people, hires people to do jobs and manages inventory, gets some sleep and gets up early to continue where he left off - All of this 'working' allows him to progress with goals. For example attacking a bandit stronghold is quite different to what it's in games like this usually - first you need to make preparations and have the necessary people found before you can try it. It took some 5 hours to get all achievements in this game.Try it out. Definitely recommended.  "

												★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆I would say it's not a game, it's some kind of interactive animation. But, well, it's not animated. And it's also not interactive... This game has nothing in common with RPG genre (perhaps except the storyline, from zero to hero, which is often associated with RPGs). There is no character created by player and player has de facto no infuance of its further development. Story is 100% linear and you have literally zero options to choose, except skipping the whole game if you want to skip any particular task. Dialogues means just clicking and confirming predefined statements. In fact (from game's mechanics point of view) it's just casual economical game, based on simple rules of collecting and exchanging resources. It has even graphics similar to Settlers. But you cannot lost here. Even the battles cannot be lost! To join the fight you need to provide a specific number of resources (soldiers, tools, weapons, healing potions etc.). Encountered enemies will wait for you until you have all you need to start a fight and automatically win.HotK is about 3,5h of gameplay (don't be mistaken by my 7h hours caused by idling scripts). Replayability factor equals zero due to linear story mentioned above.			"

												Sort of an adventure, but not really ---- it's different and unique.You have to leave the peace of your farm to find your father who seems to be in the hands of bandits.As you go, there are a ton of simple tasks to perform (find this, build that, etc.) for the various people you meet along the way. You have to keep up with your supplies, your energy, and your list of all the tasks.While the approach is very relaxed, there is some strategy involved so you have to stay alert and not waste the resources you have on a task that won't push the game forward.Somewhat like a TM game, but involves resources.The mechanics are flawless, and the artwork is great.It is a simple and clever game that moves a bit slowly for me, but I think it's worth a look. Might be just what you're looking for. So I recommend giving the demo a go, at least.			"

												I'm honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. Bought it for a mere $.49 on sale a few months ago. Just today, I was able to 100% it in one sitting. It was a perfect rainy afternoon or ""home sick with the flu"" pasttime.It feels like a well done independent flash game. I would categorize it as a casual hybrid between lite RPG, point-&-click adventure, puzzler, and hidden pictures game. Several of the genres Hero of the Kingdom taps do not often count amongst my favorites. But for some reason, this game was a perfect balance of these different genres as well as what it demanded of me as the gamer. It concluded at just the right moment when I was starting to grow weary of the main plot. And I was able to find that last clutch of eggs for the final achievement just as I was starting to get bored with the task.If it's on sale at $1 or less, I'd definitely say this is a must have.An additional recommendation—I think that parents of sharp eyed 8-12 year olds might want to consider this as an option for their kids. Good diversion for the backseat, train, or airport.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is an odd game, but an entertaining game. Is it worth $6? No. It's far too short to be worth $6. But if it is on sale, definitely consider it.HotK is a very casual point and click experience that is reminiscent of old multiplayer browser games like, ""Wild West"" i believe it was called. If you don't appreciate casual storytelling experiences, then do yourself a favor and leave this game's store page immediately. There's not much to explain about how the game works other than that you click on some icons that represent activities, spend or acquire resources by doing so, and progress in the story or progress in acquiring the resources you need to progress. That's all the game is. Do story missions, run out of resources, do side activities for money and resources, rest to replenish HP, and repeat. To be very honest, this formula grows stale around the ending, even if it is a short game. So is HoTK worth playing? Yes. There are no major points to review as pros or cons really and it is literally absent of bugs from what I experienced. If the features appeal to you then pick it up today. The FINAL VERDICT will be based on its status as a GAME, not in comparison to Triple A titles that obviously out-do it. And for that verdict I'd give it an 7/10. It wasn't perfect, but it was fun. If it could have been a bit longer and had some extra gameplay mechanics it would have been better. Note you'll get about 3 hours out of it if you stick to grinding story alone, maybe 4 if you go for acheivements. Keep that in mind if you ever plan on picking this title up.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a simple point and click game that mixes, adventure, with hidden object with RPG.  The storyline is memorable, but not necessary to follow and the puzzles are simple enough that you will most likely never have to start over or figure out what you are missing.  The RPG elements are the loot that you pick through the hidden object genre where items are scatter across all of the screens that you will visit.  You also have to watch your health to ensure you have enough strength to accomplish the chores, fights, and quests that you need to accomplish.  This is casual at the very heart, but it mixes up the genres very well.  I highly doubt anyone will ever die or get stuck in this game as it can definitely hold your hand throughout if you let it.  I found the art to be beautiful, the music to be satisfying and on nights when you feel like kicking back and relaxing while playing a video game, this fit the need perfectly.			"

												Veeeeeery casual point & click adventure, super short but nevertheless enjoyable and charming. But, to be completely honest, the game is only worth buying if you get it as a part of a bundle or on sale (it's included in the Blink bundle[www.blinkbundle.com] at the moment of writing). You begin the game as a errand boy humble farmer. Who, as the game progresses, evolves into the Badass Errand Boy *gasp!* Hero of the Kingdom! But no, seriously, if you dislike ""fetch quests"", then steer clear of this game altogether. There's no avoiding those.To sum it up, the entire gameplay consists of jumping between the chunks of the world map, helping the elderly, picking up pretty flowers, hunting for pixels, wild animal genocide and occasional Bad Guy slaying. That's it, really. The (heavily linear) story is like something straight out of a children's book geared towards ages 5-7. No replayability value, unless you're into meaningless grinding and achievement hunting.So why in the blazing hell am I still recommending this? 'Cause the game is still fun and relaxing, very nice to look at and sends me back to my school days when I was obsessing over Stronghold 1. Not sure what to expect of the sequel that's in the works, yet, but it definitely looks prettier. Hopefully the game will catch up story-wise, too.			"

												You follow a young boy that hoards so much stuff that he helps save the kingdom from imminent darkness. I would consider it to be cliche but the main character is just better than everyone else in this world. If everyone wasn't so lazy and just help each other, hire some folk, fish a little, pick some mushrooms, and etc. The Dark Lord wouldn't be such an issue for them.Overall, fun game for completionist and casual players alike. I sunk a few hours into beating the entire thing but there's no replay value after you've done everything. Perhaps waiting for a sale would be optimal for this point and click adventure.			"

Hero of the Kingdom is an awesome game in so many ways. First of all, it can save you hundreds of dollars spent on a psychologist. Really, this game it's so simple and makes you so chilled that you forget about everything while playing it. However, I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. Let's see it in more detail: This is a game unlike others This is the kind of game that you think about playing for a couple of minutes to give it a chance and before you know it, you have been 4 hours in front of the screen. Also, the soundtrack is pretty awesome too. I don't know why people haven't commented on it, but I liked it a lot since it goes really well with the game. Basically, the game is a point&click where you must help your father that has been captured by a bunch of thiefs and save the kingdom in the process. It's simple, it's linear, it's athmosperic and it's awesome. It's not for everyone, though The problem with this game is that it may be too simple for some people. There's no much variety on it, you can't die and there's nothing particularly astounding on the dialogue. It's a simple game. You need to know it, because if you expect an awesome RPG full with dialogues and choices you will get disappointed, but if you don't hype it and play it for what it is, you will end up liking it. You should also know that this is a short game, I'm sure you can complete the whole story in about 4 hours and I personally collected all the achievements in about 9. And trust me, after you played it and collected all the achievements, you dont't want to play it again. It's basically the same thing over again, so the replay value on this one is about zero.So, should I buy Hero of the Kingdom?Only if you are not looking for a challenge. This game offers just a nice, calmed, short story that can be awesome in it's own way. Want to chill out a bit from action games? This game offers that. Give it a chance and it might surpise you. The demo is free so you won't lose anything.			"

												It's a 4 hour point and click adventure game.  You find a quest, learn some materials you need to gather, then search around the map for the resources you need.  I finished pretty much everything there is to finish and the game wasn't bad.  The only complaint I have is the horribly cliche storyline.  The developers obviously wrote it themselves having no idea how to write an interesting fiction and out came one of the most cliche stories you've ever read.  Thankfully, games don't care too much about stories, so you can just ignore it most of the time.  The point and click part is actually pretty fun and the amount of time I needed to search for something that was truly hard to find was once.  You can reliably finish this game in four hours, they never try to make you stuck in this game.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a very strange game with a story literally as lackluster as its title. It's actually the most apt title you could give a game with such a children's novel story. The game itself, however, is quite unique.It's difficult to explain the 'gameplay'. It's primarily resource management and questing. It takes pieces of RPGs, photo hunts, Anno-style management, and exploration and merges them all together into this strange concoction. I'll admit the Age of Empires II style art is what originally drove me to it. There's no real difficulty here, just relaxing puzzles.I don't know whether or not to recommend it because I think that's impossible to determine. I will say it's the only game of its type on Steam and you could spend four hours doing much worse.			"

												6 hours for a playthrough with 100% achievementsThis game is nice. Not once you have to hurry or click fast.You are a guy who searches his father. And does things for people, so that the people help him.There is a nice little story, a map for fast travel, which you do not really need but is nice to have, an inventory which you never check because the game is nice enough made so you don't need to do such things here.You just click through, have  a bit of fun and that is it.Just to get some of the dumb buyers: IT IS OPENWORLDHaha, yes it is, you can - after a while - pretty much decide for yourself what you do.But what you want to do is get money to be able to do your quests.No need to bake bread or trade fish or poison, you can get enough money withhunting and fishing and the like.But I traded, I wanted the money. I AM GREEDY! :)Get the game, have fun for some hours, or for 1/2 hours for some days, no problem you can always leave and come back.The short description would be:  Do chains of quests.

Yeah, it actually feels like open world, since you go fort and back all the time for the quests, loot and trade.Since the sequel is almost completed, I'll have some ideas for the 3rd one.I think the 3rd one should focus more on an open world experience with some more activities like bread making(industry) as in the 1st one,(baker, blacksmith, tanner, brewery  etc.) different kind of mining/crafting options, random encounters and the map in the 3rd one should be at least 4 times bigger than the 1st one. (Maybe 4 different kind of maps etc.) And also nicely balanced 150+ achievements please. I really enjoyed this game. A pure gem with a very nice combination of different ideas. Thank you developer.

Additionally the inventory is limitless, there is a lot of achievements, quicktravel exists and the hint system is available in case you get stuck. Finally the game is filled wih a variety of items - keeping your interest throughout the entire gameplay. The only issue I have with this game is that it took only 6 hours for me to complete.

												This game is pretty freaking awesome considering what it is. Hero of the Kingdom feels like a game that you might find on facebook. But it is actually an interesting little gem, with quite a lot to offer, a fairly interesting storyline, beautiful, but simple, graphics, and on top of all that a pretty neat collectathon going on. Many of the achievements are linked to collecting certain items within the game, so it becomes a bit of a search and find game, which was fine by me since I love that kind of thing.Hero of the Kingdom isn't just an adventure game, you can trade between different people in different locations to make a decent amount of money, and you have to balance the amount of money you have as well as the items you have in order to complete certain quests.I have 100% all of the achievements in the game, as well as completed all of the collections and all of the side and main quests, and have done so in just about 4 hours. That's the only complaint I have with this game, it's far too short. But the amount that it cost is, at least in my opinion, worth the amount of time you're going to get out of it. I know it says I've spent 30 hours in game, but that's only because it let's you click out of the screen, which I did and completely forgot about for an entire night. If you're into midievil adventure games, you might want to give this game a shot. I would give it a 7/10.			"

You do need sharp eyes to see everything that needs to be picked up and sometimes (my eyesight) only aimeless, repetitive clicking helps to find those last few eggs :-).

												I'd like to start off by saying that I got this game in a bundle on IndieGala. I hadn't heard of many games in the bundle, but it was cheap and I wanted to try buying some games that I wouldn't normally play and see what happened. Out of all the games in the bundle, I thought this one would be the least interesting, because at first glance, it seemed like one of those stupid games they put up on Facebook or something. Honestly, though, I'm quite surprised at how much I like this game. It's just a simple point n' click adventure, but it still incorporates elements to make it seem like a RPG, too. You start off as a farmer, but a group of bandits burn down your farmhouse, and you end up going on a huge adventure and become a hero. Unlike other games of this type, you  don't become said hero by just fighting a bunch of monsters. You have to trade with people to get the proper items to help other people. It's a nice way to show that not all heroes have to be big and brawny or do huge tasks to be considered a hero. I've read some of the others reviews for this game, and it seems that a lot of people would agree with me when I say that this little game is surprisingly addictive, and most don't regret playing it. The only negative comments I have about this game are that the music gets a bit bothersome after a while, and the game could've delved a bit deeper in order to make the game last longer, but other than that, I think it's pretty solid.Pros:-Addictive-Simple-Nice perspective on heroism Cons:-Music gets bothersome-Could've been longer/more in depthScores:Gameplay: 8/10Soundtrack: 5/10Style: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Attractiveness: 8/10Overall: 8/10			"

												I never expected to like this game as much as I did but it is strangely addictive. If you like all manner of quests -- main as well as  side quests -- and you like point and click games, then this one might just do the trick. True, the graphics are quite simple and nothing to shout about. The level design is really not that tough and the only real challenge is seeing how much of the map you can remember and where resources and items are located. But the soundtrack is very soothing and I found myself playing for a lot longer than I planned and completing the game in 3 hours. It is a very short game and you can zip through it very quickly so best if you buy this when it is on sale and not full price. The story is also pretty straightforward and you are playing it as the son-hero on the classic hero's journey. If you have some time to kill, need a game in between games that will relax you and not stress you out at all, this is the game for you. Probably great for younger gamers as well. There are some battles and goblins and magicians but nothing overtly violent in any way.			"

												I like some hidden object games, so thought I'd give this one a try. It has a rather interesting storyline, plus it's fairly easy to figure out. It's click based, so you select the items to complete tasks and collect other items to complete other tasks.I actually found it interesting and fun to try and find all the hidden items that were in the map areas. Eggs in a nest, different types of mushrooms, fishing, finding lost crates or barrels and even hunting some animals. Making sure to have the required things to do a task, like the right amount of health, the tool or weapon and such is a good idea, as it would be easy to try and go after something with low health if you don't check it.Overall I found it rather enjoyable, a fair game to play here and there without having to commit hours to it and it has an end. Far too many of the games I play, don't have an end in sight. They are MMORPGs, so this game was a fun casual romp that offered a break from the far more intense gaming sessions.Hope you found this helpful in some way and if you like hidden objects, give it a look.

												I'm a cynical sort when it comes to games. There are so many of them on Steam, and with debacles like NMS, it's easy to become a bit jaded. I typically avoid most hidden object games to boot, so when I fired up Hero of the Kingdom I expected something pretty boring and tedious. I'm happy to say that I was wrong - and what I found recaptured some old memories for me.Remember when you were a kid, discovering games for the first time, and letting your imagination whisk you away? I'm nearly thirty now, and that feeling is too rare these days. Hero of the Kingdom didn't blow me away, but it did help me remember that sometimes games can be like a cosy blanket that you settle into at the end of the day. A hot mug of tea and a crackling fire in winter - that's what this game is. The simple, rustic fantasy setting and verdant aesthetic, the gentle score and straightforward-yet-rewarding gameplay all combine very well to create a surprisingly immersive experience. The whole is much greater than the sum, I feel.You start out with a pretty typical fantasy trope via your farm being burned to ashes by bandits, and your father going missing. From there, you embark on an adventure to capture all the krayfish and mercilessly steal eggs from nests. I mean, erm, 'helping fellow villagers'. These tasks range in importance...some are incredibly menial, some revolve around the livelihood of an NPC, and others up the stakes towards the prevention of an apocalypse. It's all quite homely, although the game doesn't shy away from generic soldiers getting killed. Essentially, the gameplay revolves around resource management in a point & click environment - collect materials, trade them, sell them for cash, and so forth. You're fairly well railroaded at first, although at around the halfway point you can elect to ditch the sidequests in favour of just buying everything, if you're happy to buy/sell accordingly and get an endless profit going.I was sceptical, but Hero of the Kingdom won me over from the outset. I beat the game in six hours, and I was thoroughly impressed. Well worth the cash when it's on sale, if only for being able to indulge your inner child for a few hours. I didn't even find all the collectables, but I don't mind that - it just gives me an excuse to come back and play it all again in a few months time...			"

												A nice one night sitting game. Cool story. Nice visuals. Neat look&findit objects throughout the game. Items gathering, crafting and selling. Kinda needs you to understand how to make coins at one point, but no matter. One downside is that when you deliver your last mission the game finishes and resets, and doesn't let you complete some random gatherings for remaining achievements. So make sure to gather/kill/complete all the side objectives before last battle.			"

												A nice, casual point-and-click adventure game with resource management and a decent storyline, Hero of the Kingdom is a nice game that fulfills it's purpose, with low-to-no pressure on the player to get things done fast. It's easy to play, even while distracted. And thus definitely well-suited to a casual player, or someone who wants to play a little something that's not-too-engaging with a little free time. =Complete Review=  (TL:DR version and Conclusion at the bottom)=The Story: 3/5= You play as a farm boy with dreams of grandeur, of who's father has left you to take care of the farm while he takes care of some errands in town. One day, while you're out repairing the old lookout tower down the road from the farm, bandits set your father's farm ablaze. Not even raiding it, just raizing the whole thing! Now with no home, you must set out on a quest to find your father, who has not returned, and find out why the bandits destroyed your home. Throughout your adventure, you find many people in need of your aid. Some who also were hassled by the same bandits who burned your farm to the ground. And soon find that there are much bigger things at work than just the bandits. The story is engaging enough to encourage playing it through to the end, but simple enough to allow players to take a break if need be, with no pressure or timers.=The User Interface: 2/5=  The interface is barely there, which is nice for those who prefer a minimalistic UI. At each of the four corners of the screen, there are buttons to bring up the actual UI or to serve as a function of their own, of which they tuck themselves out of view when not moused over.  My only real complaint is how cluttered the inventory can get, but.. I figure one easy fix would be, I dunno... Cleaning it out?... I've got a problem with playing pack rat, yes...=The Gameplay: 3/5= The gameplay is pretty nice and simple. The layout is from a overhead view, and you click on what you want to interact with. Arrows at the edges of the screen indicate that you can move in that direction to another screen. Typically little icons will hover over things that need to be, or can be interacted with. But, as you progress through the game, there's more things to interact with that aren't highlighted. Hidden objects of a sort, if you will. Of which result in some very nice resources in-game, and achievements if you find a lot of them. =The Graphics: 3/5= The graphics are nice, sweet, and to the point. They're well done, and it's not often that there's sprites or the like that overly clash with the area. Everything blends well together, and doesn't have severe drops or increase in certain objects' quality, thus looking like they'd logically exist in the same setting. =The Audio: 3/5=  The music serves it's purpose decently. The music is nice, without being overly repetitive, and matches the settings quite well. But it's also not the kind of music you'll be finding yourself listening to when not playing the game. The sound effects are nice, and also serve to give a idea on what's in the current scene. There's not much of this employed though, sadly. And I do hope that's addressed in the sequel. =TL;DR/Pros & Cons=Pros- Decent storyline.- Easy to play casual gameplay.- Nicely done graphics that don't look out of place.- Music and sounds that fit the location.- Good amount of Achievements.Neutral- Minimalistic UI is only there when you need it.Cons- Fairly short game.- A bit too casual for those wanting something more from their game experience.- So... Much... Backtracking...=The Conclusion: 6.5/10= A simple game to fill a simple need, Hero of the Kingdom is best suited for the casual gamer, and suits them well. The asthetics and gameplay are well done and serve their purpose. The game is seemingly well crafted despite it's simplistic nature, and doesn't seem to suffer from a lack of quality, inciting that the developer put much love in to this game and didn't make it to purely be a cash grab. Which is nice to see.It's definitely a good game to pick up on sale, which just so happens to be right now as of me writing this. So if the game sounds good to you, it would be a nice thing to pick up for a couple bucks.Thank you very much for taking your time to read my review.			"

												If:1) You enjoy linear, point & click style games that are heavy on the item finding aspect and...2) You're tired of getting kicked around by more complex, unforgiving games and need a shot in your gaming ego...Give Hero of the Kingdom a look.  It's straightforward, short and simplistic, yet charming and gratifying at the same time.  Casual, the-exact-opposite-of-intense gameplay as it is meant to be.  I'm giving the game a thumbs up because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is and it doesn't have any glaring flaws.  But the recommendation comes with a caveat:  get it on sale.  It's not that it's a bad game, it's just that there simply isn't enough of it.  100%ing the game should take a few hours at most.  And there are a lot of games at a lower price point that can provide the same level of entetainment.			"

												The game was short and most of the fun was probably searching for all the collectables and the few tedious things here and there which did keep you moving around. It made great use of even old areas to go back and do things as you progressed which a lot of games kind of lack. The game is extremely linear, though there are some optional side quests to complete. Real action is not in this game but the artwork here is what compensates that. The game is only truly playable once. After that you know what's going to happen. Towards the end I had been expecting perhaps a twist but, sadly there was none. Honestly the way the game plays out is definitely different and has a lovely layout and design. I wish there was more too it besides all there was. I finished it in one sitting which was quite nice. I do believe that it's not worth the amount of money it is however. Probably half that. It does require a bit of a patience to really go through it though. All in all it's very simplistic and straightforward. I would say the hardest part about the entire thing would be simply remembering where everything is located when you need more. If not for the fact that it's identical with playthrough two I would have no trouble playing through it again thanks to the pleasant experience I had. If you do decide to give it a shot I highly recommend waiting for a price drop however.			"

Short version: 85%Hero of the Kingdom mixes turn-based fantasy strategy gameplay with tycoon-like resource management on a strictly casual level. What is remarkable about it is the good balance between the gameplay aspects.Long version:Hero of the Kingdom is a resource management strategy game– something that fits well to the portfolio of the Slovakian development team– with a fantasy adventure theme. The goal is always to gather enough resources to pass the current objective. This requires a careful management of gold (for tools to gather the resources with) and strength (which serves the role of time units). There is no combat or levelling: if you have the resources to pass an obstacle, you automatically do so.The mechanics are decent, but not perfect: there are exploits to get infinite gold and strength (although slowly), and it is easy to get confused by the variety of required resources by the end.The story is fairly basic: find abducted relative, find bad sorcerer, kill bad sorcerer. This simplicity works to its advantage though as it lets the game put more focus on the dozens of side quests, giving it a classic RPG feel. Still, most players will likely reach 100% completion status within 4-5 hours, making Hero of the Kingdom a short, but fun game.			"

												This is exactly the casual adventure with a tiny hint of resource management that gets you to relax after a long day at work.The story is very simple, but thankfully not dumb-simple. The artwork is delightful especially if you're into this sort of 'painted' medieval setting. (think Stronghold, Robin Hood: Legend of Sherwood, HoMaM 3 etc)The soundtrack is heavenly. It's the kind of music that gives you a sense of adventure, yet you still feel like reading a fairy tale while listening to it.The gameplay, as stated, is very casual. Sit back, click, relax. At first it may seem like the game is adamant in showing you how to do every little thing to the point where you're like 'geez, I get it, let me do it alone', but have patience.8/10 - because it's rather short and there's not much replay value. But I still recommend it.			"

												This was one of the better casual games in my collection. It's mostly a point & click adventure with some RPG-like quests and trading built in. I appreciated what depth it did have without having something convoluted or difficult built in just to try to extend the playtime. The story is not complex, and it's fairly typical of this type of game, but it provided enough to give a feel of progression. I completed the game in one sitting as I was completely immersed in it.I'm a big fan of this style of graphics. It has an older Ages of Empires or Stronghold feel to it. I enjoyed going between each area and completing quests just to see what all I'd see. The audio/music complemented the game well. It was just enough to make it enjoyable without being overbearing or out of place.There is some backtracking to be done depending on what the quests require. Not everything is available the first time you visit a zone. The only annoying thing was the ""Gather XX of Something"" achievements. It just made it a grind and somewhat annoying, especially the eggs. It was like an Easter egg hunt without the color. Even so, I managed to complete the main quest and all of the other achievements within 7 hours.The $5.99 price tag may be questionable for some. Casual is one of my primary game types, and for what this game has to offer, I could see paying it. However, I got this during one of the sales in 2014, and I don't regret buying it. If you're not sure if you should get it now or wishlist it for a sale later, there is a Demo available for you to try.I have purchased Hero of the Kingdom II, so I will be playing that one next!

												6/10I came across this while trying to curb my game expenditure by trawling the depths of the cheapest games on steam and the fact this review (and many of the steem reviews) is positive reflects how cheap/bundled this game often is. It's a simple, short but quite well done little time-killer that might appeal when you are in the mood for something slower.You progress through a series of reasonably pretty full-screen maps. Each one you visit might hold a handfull of missions plus perhaps a merchant, tradesman, somewhere to rest, etc and will definately hide a number of hidden objects to find. Once you unlocked each screen you can return at any time to use the merchants, finish side quests or pick up any hidden objects you missed.The story is standard fantasy fare but is fine. The graphics are ok for a game so much about staring at the screen and set the mood well. The game play is good initially though starts to grate and grind a bit in the later stages even in a comparatively short game. For example consuming food at a camp is essential to gain heart points (used to perform most quests/activities) which is accompanied by a pretty but time consuming little 'nighty night' graphic sequence. Very atmospheric the first couple of times but you need loads of heart points to get through the game and end up spamming the camp sites. It is a game that you cannot really lose - instead you just kind of amble through it... That said, I did finish it... And I did hunt about a bit for the hidden items before finishing the well-flagged final quest... And I paid £0.69 for 5 hours gameplay... Overall that makes it hard not to recommend.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom was a game I had seen around and mentioned occasionally. I saw it for almost nothing during a sale so I grabbed it and went into it basically blind. I have no regrets. I found myself unable and unwilling to hop off the game once I got started and finished it in the same sitting. It took me around 6 hours from start to finish inclusive of all achievements. For an older game with a very basic art / game play style I found Hero of the Kingdom to be a fantastic little adventure even when the story became very cheesy towards the end. Everything requires minimal thought and I breezed through the game satisfied at all times with the progression and events. If I had to point out any flaws I'd say the difficulty and the lack of replay ability. Honestly though, for what I paid I feel as if I've ripped the developers off. It was a great game and worth every penny. If you find yourself in the mood for a simple adventure / RPG / point and click game. Look no further, this game scratches all those itches. 8/10 "

If you go for all of the achievemnts, then trying to get the last eggs, crates, and mushrooms can be a bit annoying. I was able to get this on sale for $0.59, so it was very much worth my money, but I $6 is a bit much for it. Maybe more like $2 or $3.

												I managed to snag this game from a bundle. It's a quaint little game with gorgeous backgrounds and art. It's not complicated or requires too much from you, just an observant eye to catch those eggs and mushrooms hiding on the screen ( curse my poor eyesight). It reminded me of those picture books I had where I needed to find objects on a page, so it's basically akin to something like that, only animated with nice sounds. A bit too easy, but hey, every game is different and can't be as masochistic as SMB in order to be good. :)			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a point-and-click adventure/resource management game in which you play as a farm boy attempting to discover what happened to your father. You travel around the countryside collecting items and solving various quests in a series of drawn maps. There isn't much in the way of difficulty as there are a few different methods by which you can get as much money as you want, it's just a matter of figuring out your preferred method.There are a number of hidden object quests throughout the game where you search for items in the background. This can be time consuming and is the primary difficult part if you feel like completing it.The game isn't terribly long, taking about 5 hours to complete. But it scratches a zen-like itch for collector/RPG/progress fanatics, and I think you'll get your money's worth if you're into those sorts of games.			"

												i didn't expect much from this game and i was very pleasantly surprised.the graphics are neat, sound fits in just fine and the music is relaxing as well.obviously it's a casual game. there is no real difficulty at all but the game certainly knows how to keep you busy. and that's no problem at all since it comes with all the quality of life features you need. it even has a map with fast travel so you don't need to curse if you are missing a healing potion or two arrows for your next adventure. even the story is rather decent and the fixed screen resolution isn't such a big deal after all. the game was finished in 4.5 hours and i grabbed all the achievements in the same run. if you feel bored during the weekend or you're sick at home and can't game as hard as usual then it's perfectly fine.if it looks interesting to you and you even take the time to read the reviews then i don't see why you shouldn't enjoy this game as well.

												There is nothing wrong with this game, if you enjoy point and click adventure games, where the majority of the game is going back and forth to double click some resources. I found it interesting at first, but I suppose I expected the game to expand and before I knew it, I was playing the game for achievements and nothing more...			"

												I like the concept behind this game. Travelling through an environment and saving the world by clicking on parts of it, and I am perfectly fine with it not being the most engaging experience because of it.However, the tasks quickly devolve into grinding up money to allow for the next trivial requirements on the story tasks and the game stopped being much fun well before I finished it.I did finish it though, and even though it wasn't a world-shattering ending it wasn't bad. Things get wrapped up well enough, and after that you can still muck about in the game world doing things you missed.The completionist in me was frustrated that I am still missing a few mushrooms and that there's no indicator what part of the (pretty large) map they're on.It's not a bad game at all, but probably not one I'd have bought in hindsight.Definitely give the demo a try if you like how it looks though.

												Great addictive point-and-click game that had me stuck to my screen for a few hours. I found no flaws or bugs to the game, the only thing that I think could've improved the experience would've been more gameplay customization options, less pop-ups, some more info on quest objectives, cause I found myself wandering around trying to find out where I need to go or to look and find something quest related (on this matter some glittering effects over things of interest so you can spot them easily would've helped a lot, but then again this might be intended, as you have to look very careful at everything on screen so you can take advantage of everything given to you). It's all about managing your resources, foraging and all that kind of stuff, but unfortunately has no replayability value and the game lasts for 1-2 hours. I played through it 2 times just to get all the achievements, second time went really fast. Though I have no complaints given the fact that I paid 1$ for it so it was worth.			"

												I got this game as part of a bundle, and looking at the asking price...it isn't really worth it.-There is very little game play, it is essentially managing resources and clicking all over the screen to find little hidden things.  To call it an RPG makes the original final fantasy look like morrowind.  It is basically one long trading quest, with a couple of little side trading quests. -It is not challenging at all.  I'm not sure if it is even possible to lose.  Maybe, if you were really incompetant you could squander all your resources.  Otherwise there is no tension, you will go into the final battle knowing you will win.-Randomly clicking all over the screen is a legitimate strategy. -The story is absolutely forgettable and generic fantasy,  House burns down, chase after bandits, help villagers, rescue family, defeat big evil.   -Graphics are ok for a cow clicker, but there is no way you are going to be engrossed in the ""battles""-It is very short.Beat it in one sitting.  Did I hate it? No.  Will I ever play it again? No.  I get the feeling this game is supposed to be padded out with ""freemium"" pay to play mechanics. There simply isn't a lot of game here, and I can't reccomend it outside of it being heavily discounted.  "

												A simple RPG game..As someone who usually is heisting a bank or hiding from a Xenomorph, this is a nice break from my usual adventures. The game is pretty simple, I'd say it has some basic resource management skills needed to play, and that's it.The story seems pretty good, I've enjoyed it so far. And some of the sidequests are pretty interesting.Nothing much to say for this, a nice simple game to play! I recommend it for the sale price I got it at.			"

												For the sale price I guess it's alright but I woudln't buy this on full price. It's pretty much running errands and doing quests so you can do other quests for other people. The tips aren't very helpful and it gets very frustrating at times with its lack of direction. The art isn't anything to boast about oviously as you can see from the screen shots. The music is alright the storyline is mediocre. It's not that great of a game but if you're looking to waste time for a cheap amount of money then I guess it's alright, not the worst thing you could buy.			"

												This game is a simple point and click adventure. It really isn't very much fun. You just click here to get something for a person you click over there for. Not a super in depth game, and there isn't a storyline that makes it worth playing. In fact I am not even sure what the storyline is. For six dollars this game is not worth it.			"

												*Click* *Click* *Click* *Click* *Click* Casual game with a rather pale story and some ""search those 5 pixels in a picture""-moments. Good game for easy achievments, bad game if you pay more than 2 bucks. Hero of the Kingdom is a point and click adventure mixed with a resource manager. You travel through different overview screens, visiting villages, mountains, forests and so on. On your way, you pick up items either by clicking (said ""Search those 5 pixels""-moments) or by buying/trading/questing at NPCs. The more you progress, the more resources you have. For example you need Energy to fight (a boar or wolf costs X energy), which you replenish by sleeping. You can sleep when you pay gold at inns or in the wild, if you have enough food on you (different camping sites ask for different kinds of food). You can also carry items, which hold longer (Weapons and tools, though they might break sometimes)Sadly, the system is kinda broken after a while for those, who notice how to milk endless gold out of the resource cycle. Maybe a patch would help here?The artwork is pretty good, I expect the designer to give us a full course of his abilities in the future. Everything looks very detailed and alive and every screen carries a different kind of atmosphere with it The background music is nothing outstanding, but it doesnt kill the atmosphere either. ""Generic"" comes to my mind here.Still, seeing as this is an endless orgy of clicking and searching I can not recommend it at its current price of 6 Euro. Maybe some mini-games and riddles would have helped to add simply MORE CONTENT to this game. In the end I just played it to gather all achievments, having absolutely no interest for an ending (and there is only one. Why not make different endings, depending on how you choose to solve quests and stuff? A simple BAD Ending would even give more depth...)			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a fun little point and click adventure with a slight hidden object element to it. The game has you playing the son of a farmer whose farm gets destroyed by bandits. What happens next is the start of your adventure into this interactive story. The gameplay is pretty basic, but for a casual game its a lot of fun! The fetch quests, and other various side quests are pretty much what you would expect from an RPG game. There are a couple annoying features such as not being able to buy/sell items in bulk, and running out of strength after a couple battles, but this doesn't deter you from enjoying the game. The one feature I would like to see in the sequel is for the collectible hidden object side of the game, they need to add a completion meter for each map so the player is not having to use a magnifying glass to find the last couple of missing items. The game is short and can be completed in about 5 hours if you are trying to 100% the achievements.  If you just play the story its about a 2-3 hr game. Great game for the money! I give this a solid 8/10!			"

Spotting all those things to harvest is more fun than I thought it would be.  Eventually I found them all adn to get some acheievements I had to earn my way by buying and selling.  You could play this game through fast or you could do what I did.. .I loaded teh  game up whilst I was chatting on the phone [listening and saying stuff like 'hmmm' 'yeh' 'I undersstand' etc :)  yup one of those types of conversation ]   Made the whole conversation more bareable :)  Later I played more for the fun of teh game itself.  Hunting those elusive items to score acheivements was just what I needed when I wasn't feeling well enough to play a more demanding game.			"

You pretty much point and click on parts of the area you are in to either (harvest resources, fight, build, buy/sell items). It is slow paced so you can progress at your leasure. One thing most people don't know is that you can actually click on things that do not necesarily have icons over them (ie: mushrooms,eggs,lobsters,crates,wood,rocks, and rarely hidden people). the cheapest method I found for sleeping is to spend 1 bread at the second zone you find. Later you can turn grain in to create flour and turn the flower in to get 6 bread (total cost 35 gold for 6 bread). Also, do not sell stuff you cannot find or harvest regularly, you may have to buy it back. If you ever see on sale for 50% off or more, i would recommend getting this relaxing interactive art book. 10/10 would steal that guys wood again, only to sell it back to him.			"

												Among the various casual adventure games that are out there, this one stands out as an odyssey. Recommended for casual addictive point-&-click gaming when you just want to leave your thinking-cap off and kill some time. Ghosts, goblins, bandits, castles, medieval weaponry,  trading, crafting, exploring, hunting, fishing, and more. About 7 hours of gameplay are to be had here: when taken at a leisurely pace, when you read all the story pages, and when you are going for 100 percent achievements (which is easy enough). Look for this game on-sale and grab it.			"

												These 4 hours I played this game were well worth the 1,50 I paid for it. I like these kind of games where you get to search for all kind of items to advance the story. Even though the story is simple, the different things I needed to do to advance kept me going. You need all kind of skills to collect more items and money to advance the story and open up more areas to explore. It is sometimes a bit of a puzzle where you can get or sell certain items, but that is all part of the fun. Will play part II for sure.			"

												Very nice, very casual point&click adventure RPG, Hero of the Kingdom tells a familiar story of a farmboy turned hero.The wannabe hero begins his journey when bandits burn his family farm down. He gets to do all sorts of jobs from woodcutting to burning to healing wounded people. Gameplay is simple: clicking a marker will give you a short written description (no voice-over here) of your character's thoughts, what you can (and therefore should) do and what you need to accomplish that. You need many kinds of resources in the form of food, vitality, gold and tools.While the gameplay is a casual adventure, you also have to manage the said resources. You'll gain vitality by resting, which requires food that is acquired by foraging or hunting, which in part require tools and skills. Many parts of this chain could have been removed to smooth the gameplay: with them, however, it is an adventure RPG game, not just a barely visual novel.There are also many details in the areas that turn out to be significant later on. Some of them are ""hidden"", though, meaning that you just have to click them to see if they react: stuff like collectable mushrooms and lootable barrels form this category.The narration is casual and easygoing, containing little to no fancy words. In effect, it would be quite suitable to be played with young children who can't read yet, assuming English proficiency. Like so, the story is rather traditional with the evil dark wizards and all. It's still nice enough to keep in its grip for the while it lasts.Full completion would have lasted about 4 hours, but I went for all the achievements. This added about an hour to the playtime because I just couldn't find several last mushrooms and hidden caches. While challenging, I was irritated to check the same areas ten times just to find those last missing items. Anyway, this is amended, as I really enjoyed the leisure style.Replay value, IMO, is meager though. Once played through completely, there isn't much more to accomplish. That said, it is rather alright an experience for its price.			"

												I can't say I've ever played a game like Hero of the Kingdom. It's something of an adventure game that gives you a birds-eye view of your surroundings and progresses through some simple mouse clicks. I have a hard time reviewing Hero of the Kingdom, because it's so forgetable. On the other hand, it is quite an enjoyable time-killer. Let me explain. Hero of the Kingdom is about a young man whose farm is burned to the ground--forcing him to journey out into the world to survive. From there the story becomes generic in almost every sense of the word. You'll fight skeletons, beasts and goblins before eventually taking on a dark wizard. While I can see that a lot of love went into this game, the writing could definitely be more original. The gameplay involves a lot of trading. You'll essentially be roaming around the various areas searching for items to sell or animals to hunt so you can get gold with which you can purchase supplies you need to further the story. While I played quite a bit of the game several months ago (I don't remember how long I played, but I remember accidently leaving the game running for a while, so my time played is off) and I didn't manage to get myself to finish it until a couple days ago. For me, the concept of constantly trading like in Hero of the Kingdom becomes tedious. Especially when you unlock every area of the game and it gets tough remembering where certain merchants and points of interest are. I'm afraid I can't give any input on the sound. It wasn't long into the game until I just played my own music over it. Despite all of this, I'm still recommending it. This game is a great time sink. While it did repetitive after a while, the first hours were pretty entertaining. It was actually rather fulfilling to trade my way up to the items I needed. While it's just not a game for me, I can definitely see Hero of the Kingdom appealing to fans of the genre. It was certainly a good time sink for me if nothing else.			"

I Played it while I'm working and talking to a friend on FB and I could finish it in 5 hours, I believe I can finish it in just 2 hours if I was very focused, it's the length of a flash game!The game is just too easy after you clear the Old Jack quest, after completing that you can buy fish at 4 bucks each and you can sell them at 6 bucks each in the town. The arbitrage would give you infinite money provided you have the time.It would be nice if there's a saturation of market that the player has to grind on other places for money. But with the current build at the time of writing the player is just GOD as he can has infinite money easily.And in this game money = GOD (Maybe a nice reflection of the real world), you can have many things done instantly if you are ready to pay.That being said, I still recommend this game, it helped refresh my mind during a long working day!

												So glad to finally play a casual game on PC that isn't a mobile port. I would characterize Hero of the Kingdom as a casual adventure game with some trading elements. There are no reflexes required, you simply need to click around the different maps to collect various items and turn them in to complete tasks. When you complete most tasks you beat the game. Overall you shouldn't expect to play this for more than a couple hours but it is a good use of time where you don't need to stress out. I found the story to be serviceable given the scale of the game.All actions in the game are ultimately governed by its currency, which is gold. So if you want to do lots of things, such as stock up on supplies, get more hit points or hire more helpers, you need gold. This is where the trading part of the game comes in. There is only a finite number of resources you can gather before you run out, but you can manufacture more money by astutely trading the resources between various NPCs. I found this to be kind of interesting, but ultimately maybe not that constructive as the game actually gives you a good amount of money. I blame it on my RPG hoarding tendencies, but if you sell everything you gather (and you should! there are no missables!) you should only have to do a minimum of trade farming.Lastly, many people play this game because it is easy to get 100% achievements. Not really my thing, but that could be a reason to play this game as well.			"

												[If you like ""Where's Waldo"" consider this review with a ""yes"" recomendation.]RPG for the explorer and item map item seeker:Positives:           1)  The map hunting for items and materials was intriguing and fascinating.         2)  The management aspect (time vs. items) of the game was worthy of compliment.          3)  The story was pleasant.         4)  Side quests were motivational and interesting enough to peak interest in them.On the fence:           1)  Music was acceptable...         2)  The world was interesting...however it was small.         3)  The dialogue is fine, but ... at the same time not all that important.Negatives:         1)  Short (beat it under 5 hours.         2)  Too expensive for such a short game with minimal ""replay-ability"".         3)  Why is everyone relying on you?   (Are you the only compentent person in the kingdom?)         4)  Too easy... no real skill seems to be required.  (Point and click, point and click, point and click...)         5)  Hunting a boar with a dagger...  NO!   It was stupid in ""Lord of the Flies"" and it is stupid here.  (For the literature people.)         6)  There is very little choice in this game; so, is it really an exploration game?Overall:  I lacks a lot.  It was a good idea, and the visual scenic hunt is exceptional.  If you like, item hunting games like ""Where's Waldo"" this would be a good one for you.   Wait until it is on sale (~$2.00).			"

In order to progress in the game, you have to manage your resources and figure out what is and is not valuable to you at any point in time. The graphics were super simple. At the same time, they drew me in. My only complaint is that the ending didn't match the epic nature of the game. It's just... ""Hurray! You win!""Still, I had a great time.

												For a very casual, simplistic sort of game, Hero of the Kingdom does a good job of entertaining. Yes, there are some things which are like ""wha..?"" in it, making you wonder what the developer was thinking when they were figuring the game out. Overall, however, this game was well worth the little bit of money I spent on it and was a quite enjoyable 4 hour interlude into it's realm. The story is rather predictable but still good and the point-and-click nature of the game lends itself to being fairly casual, thankfully.7.5/10. Definitely worth a few dollars.			"

												In Hero of the Kingdom you click on exclamation marks to see a checklist of materials, and then you click on the various icons scattered throughout the map to collect those materials, then you click on the exclamation mark to turn-in those materials.  You will repeat this process for the next 3-4 hours until all the exclamation marks are gone.  Then you win the game.There is no strategy - you simply click what needs to be clicked.  This game is ""item management"" at its most tedious.There are no role-playing elements - labelling this game as an RPG is inaccurate, even by the loosest of definitions.There is no tension - you cannot fail any of the tasks given to you (which, again, is just gathering materials).There is no story - well, there is, but it's about as generic and shallow as a story can get.There is no gameplay - unless you're the kind of person who thinks moving rocks from one pile to another counts as a ""game"".I did not hate my time with Hero of the Kingdom, but I did not enjoy it either - it simply felt like I turned my brain off for a few hours and gained nothing from it (besides some trading cards).  If that experience appeals to you, by all means buy this game (on sale).  But if you like games with even a modicum of depth to them, you should look elsewhere.			"

												This game is a typical clicker (all you need is a mouse). The story is certainly not a strong side of this game, although I admit that I wasn't bored and although the game itself was short (about 4 hours), it was fun. This game even forces me to strain my eyes in search of some things on the screen... and I found it also entertaining. So many from this small title...;-]			"

												 Hero of the Kingdom I is in some ways innovative with its gameplay style, i spent 5 hours playing it, trying to get every achievement finding all the things asked to be found, its quite entertaining for this kind of game.  I liked it right away after the first five minutes, the story is pretty much a cliché but its good enogh, a farmer turned into a hero to fight the forces of evil, undead monsters, globinoids, fetch quests, helping people, the works, but still its a good game.

												Not the game I thought it was, the screenshots made it looks interesting but basically it's a point and click adventure game which has a very linear progression of with virtually no exploration or individuality.Basically you are given a quest and you'll have maybe 3-4 places on the map you can click at any given time.  If you enjoy clicking things in an order pre-determined by the games code, or are under the age of 8, enjoy badly written dialogue or simply enjoy visual novels this game is for you...For the rest of us; just a bad precursor to arthritus.   Granted I don't even have a full hour of gameplay time.... so maybe you'll like it... I got this in a bundle and I still want my money back :|			"

												This game is horribly, poisonously addictive.The idea of the game is to click on certain map hotspots that either advance the plot or give you resources. You can then click on different map hotspots to exchange resources for other resources. This is sometimes puzzle-solving but much more often simply deciding which trade would be more valuable in the long run. I did say ""map,"" and I meant it; you're looking at the Kingdom you are the Hero of from an altitude of a few hundred feet.There's some combat, there are some choices of which path to pursue first, but overall the game is fairly linear and very simple. There's a kind of thin plot involving finding out what happened to your family, but it plays out very slowly. It feels like this was originally a mobile game, and seems especially suited to a touch screen ... though I wouldn't want to read this much text on a screen that size. (Also, there are irritating hidden objects, like mushrooms, scattered around, which are barely visible even on a full-size monitor.)Although it never actually happened to me, it certainly seems like it's possible to get stuck without the resources you need to continue and without any ability to accomplish anything. So there's an element of resource management. Otherwise, though, this is a decidedly mechanical point-and-click game, distinguished only by the UI's bird's-eye view.			"

Its good, but its kinda has that Bland Story of ""You lose your home, You go on a quest to find someone, You find them and they tell you their secret, and Killing a dark lord"". Sorry but thats the Spoilers of it. Its like every Hero game, Very Linear. So I am sorry to say this, but it is not worth your time and money.			"

												I absolutely love this game. A mix of point and click and adventure with great story that leaves you wanting more with every newely discovered area. There's fishing, gathering and hunting to be done. This is a well paced game with a spot of what I would consider ""open world"" that branches off into several sidequest that tie in quite nicely with the main story.Pro tip for beginners: When you can buy fruit from the fruit seller, make sure you spend all your available gold on fruit and backtrack to the Farmer's Wife and sell all of your fruit to her. If you do this for a while you'll be able to afford tools, food and other various items you need in the upcoming areas. One reviewer said that he barely had enough money to get to new areas but the whole point of the game is to see it from the character's perspective, he has to go between villages and barter to make a profit to continue on his journey. It's not lazy, it forces you to play the game the way it was meant to be played and not find a loophole past everything.Update: Having completed the game a couple of days ago, I am satisfied with it's ending. All of the loose ends toward the last couple of hours of gameplay finally came together. My only grief with the game is that there wasn't enough clashing during the important end game battles, the sound effects could've been extended a bit longer to emphasize how intense and important they were.I recommend this game for anyone looking for a casual well paced game. The point is to follow the story and be taken on the well told (albeit short journey) of a young man who's on a quest to find his Father while being unknowingly whisked into an age old battle involving the Dark Wizard.

												This was an interesting game that I found oddly addicting. Most of the gameplay takes place in small areas, one area for each overworld location and the player clicks on events within each area. Earn enough items, gold, etc to complete each event and you'll make your way to the end of the game. As the player progresses, new event types open up as well as a kind of hidden object sub-game. Not really challenging, but good for those with an obsessive streak.			"

Hero of the Kingdom is a slightly unusual mix of point-and-click adventure and rpg. It looks like an old-school isometric rpg, but there is no character to control - instead all actions are performed by clicking on object like in a point&click title. The basic rpg premise is still here (slight spoilers!) - an ordinary boy on a quest to find his father turns into a hero that saves the land from dire evil. Yeah, like no one expected that, spoilers over. The boy learns skills during the adventure - hunting, herbalism, etc - in order to get closer to his goal. As if the mix wasn't unusual enough the game adds in some Hiden Object elements - there are treasures and extra items hidden around in the bushes, rivers, barrels. Visually the game has nothing to be shy of, it's a simple but well drawn style. Map elements are clearly distinguishible and even the hidden items are fairly easy to spot with a little practice. It's overall easy on the eye even for longer sessions. The audio is pleasant enough too, can't say much in detail about it personally but at least it feels right. Sadly, there is very little, if any, voice acting and that might diminish the enjoyment for some players - while lots of detailed text and dialogues can be enrich the world it might also bore the player.Personally I find the mix pretty entertaining, then again I enjoy casual games so take what I say with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, the story moves at a good enough pace to keep boredom away and it's easy to enjoy this in bite-sized portions if so desired. Time-wise the game takes around 5 hours for a relaxed playthrough, dipping to maybe 3-3.5 for a speedy run and climbing to approx 8 for a single 100% run. At L5 that is pretty good value for anyone who likes a more casual adventure. tl;dr: At £5 it's a good mix of point&click, adventure, and casual gameplay.			"

												I actually take a fairly neutral stance on this game, but for the sake of leaving a review I lean towards 'recommend.'Pros:  The artwork is beautifully done and the navigation layout isn't bad.  Although the storyline is a bit hackneyed, I still found myself getting into it.  The text based narration was decent and the sound effects were well done.  Finding all the hidden goodies throughout the game felt like a flashback to Where's Waldo books.Cons:  Don't expect a lengthy game!  I beat it twice in under 10 hours for all the achievements.  The entire game only encompasses a small group of tiles, so not much exploring.  The harvesting can be tedious when combined with the constant need to rest and exchange for supplies.  Most of the harvesting is only used to monotonously build up money instead of crafting or building.If you're looking for a game to relax and kill a few evenings, it will do well.  The game has so much potential but it just stops far short.			"

												""Eh"" -- This was how I felt after completing this game. My best assessment would be it is one part hidden object game, one part story. I am even hard-pressed to call it a ""Game"" because it's so linear and the only real ""skill"" to it is being comprehensive in clicking everywhere and making sure you have enough gold to accomplish the next task. I would have enjoyed the game better if combat was not all automatically a success as long as you brought the right materials (and you aren't even allowed to initiate combat without said materials, so where is the fun in that?) ... I mean, include SOMETHING that requires decision-making, or strategy, or twitch skills... otherwise it's just another step in a procedure. Still, I am leaving a positive recommendation because obviously it was compelling enough for me to finish it... but there are a great many better RPGs out there. I have no regrets playing it though.			"

												This amazing game was definately worth it's price!Hero of the Kingdom is point'n'click fabular game. You live on a small farm away from the civilization - suddenly your father was kidnapped by bandits. You have to rescue him, and... You'll see by your own! :)Story was quite good. This game's story is more for a children than an adult, but i enjoyed it. It's really simple. like in classical point'n'click you have to click on terrain to find hidden treasures, or get resources. There are also some interesting side quests with ghosts and more. There are 3 skills - Alchemy, Hunting and Fishing, and nothing more - that's not RPG game with all those stats. What's more, you can buy and sell some stuff, and do some simple side quests. game is for 2-4 hours. The biggest con was unsophisticated story - and that's all. As i said on the start, game was worth it's price and I reccomend it to every point'n'click and medieval fan!			"

												At first glance this probably doesn't look like very much.  It might be confusing as to what type of game it is.Despite being tagged by many as an RPG, this is definitely an adventure game.  It isn't very dialogue heavy but the storyline is more than sufficient, and although it is essentially linear, it cleverly gives the illusion of not being so.  It is longer than you might expect, and tracks the story of a young boy  on his journey to save his father.  It's fairly generic, but the style of the game is rather unique, so this is easily forgiven.Be careful- you might read elsewhere online that you can get achievements after you complete the game by continuing.  This isn't true.  I found this out the hard way and will have to get the rest when I  play it again someday.  I can't judge the developer for this, though.			"

												Fun, relaxing game. Definitely no brain-drain here. Maybe a slight bit of tedium if you want to stockpile the money and tools. For instance, I buy grain, go down 2 maps to have it ground then back up to turn it into bread then down four maps to sell them to the farmer's wife. But that's just the OCD'er in me. Probably unnecessary since there's plenty of things to gather that you can sell. I was just always afraid I'd sell off things that might be needed in one of the fetch quests later.That's pretty much the game; Story-driven RPG element fetch quests and hidden objects. If you don't like those two gameplay elements then pass on this. If you're okay with them then this is a definite buy at this price, because you will be kept busy and entertained.Good music, nice scenery, nice story, laid-back gameplay. The perfect relaxing game to sit down with either with your morning coffee, or to unwind after a long day at work or school.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a game, I'd probably describe as a light, casual point’n’click-hidden-object-RPG-adventure, which happens to be surprisingly addicting.It's basically a simple game, in which you click on certain hotspots on the map to interact with your environment (for example shopkeepers to buy or sell items, a camp to restore some stamina or quest-npcs to start or finish the main- or one of several sidequests) and move yourself through about 25 screens of a nice-looking medieval world, advancing in a (shallow and not really innovative) story of a boy from a farm saving his father and becoming a hero at the end.While you basically always do the same thing (just click on things), the objectives you have to fulfill are actually pretty diverse. Sometimes you have to kill stuff (animals, villians), find things hidden-object-style (eggs, mushrooms, sheep) or collect (and/or buy) the right resources to build buildings or equip an army. There are even some professions to master (fishing, herbalism).Still these things are so simple, that literally anyone could succeed to finish the game in a reasonable time. Optionally you can also try to collect all 38 achievements, which include finding a big portion of all hidden-object items.Unfortunately, even if you try to 100% the game, it only takes about 3-4 hours to do so. But that might even be a good thing, because otherwise the simple gameplay could get boring and repetetive after some time.Also you have to know, what you’re getting with this game. If you’re expecting a much deeper, complex game, the game will most likely disappoint you. But fortunately there is a demo available to test the game and see if it is for you.Overall, I think, this is an awesome game, that can be fun for ANYONE: Casual players as well as actual ‘gamers’, who don’t mind simple gameplay and a shallow story, can enjoy an addicting medieval adventure with a decent atmosphere. Granted: The game might be short, but the price isn’t to high (6$), especially on sale. I encourage everyone to give this one a try (at least the demo)!On a scale from 1 to 10 I’d give this one an 8.

												Hero of the Kingdom is a hybrid between an RPG and a casual resource-management game. From the outlook, you may think it's like an old-school RTS, like I did. Reminds me of Stronghold.Once you go into it, you'll realize that it's nothing of the sort.Basically, you travel around the land, buying, gathering and selling supplies, so that you can progress, by doing quests. It's... surprisingly compelling. On paper, I'd say this game wouldn't work! After trying it, though, it managed to keep me playing to completion. There's an overarching story, but it's very cliché. It did nothing whatsoever to invest me, as there weren't any great characters or situations. It was just there.PresentationAs I said, it looks a bit old. However, I really like this graphic style. I love the way the how old RTS games looked, and this is basically an higher resolution version of that. The iconography in the game felt a bit out of place, at times, but it identifies everything well enough, so I won't complain.Other than that, the interface has a medieval feeling (especially the frames and the map) that fits the feeling of the game.The sound-effects were a bit too sparkly for me. They didn't fit the rest of the game, being more suited for a children's game, with a cartoony look. Regardless, they're otherwise functional.The music is open, I believe, but it was well chosen. There isn't much to say about it. It's pretty simple, fantasy-like background music, but it did its job of getting you into the game's atmosphere.There were a few interface issues I've had, but I've later found out that most of them could have been avoided, with a bit more explanation. Basically, everything requires 2 clicks -- always. First, you click the objective or object you want to collect, and then there's some feedback, and a box appears with a ""V"" for you to click, to continue. This last step, in my opinion, was completely unnecessary. Also, the box appears in the object's place, so you'll often have to ""backtrack"" with the mouse, if you were ready to leave the screen, or something. This is avoided by pressing SpaceBar when the box appears. That way, you can just press it and the box will go away, so it partially solves the problem -- this, however, was never hinted at, in the game.Overall, there are just lots of unnecessary clicks, in a game that's all about clicking. I believe that the visual and audio feedback was sufficient, but I may be wrong.Story and WritingAs I've mentioned, the story is completely cliché. Your farm burns, and you go on a quest to save your father and be an hero. Then, you find that there's a bigger evil on the world, and you want to eliminate it. That's about it. There's isn't any real idea to be trasmitted by it, no interesting characters, nothing whatsoever. Bottom-line: don't play it for a story.The writing also felt very amateur, in general. The game just feels like it could be written by a middle-schooler. It's not awful, but there's nothing, at any point, that will surprise you or even amuse you. The phrasing is very simple, with not character having any personality... Meh. You can easily skip it and you won't miss anything.Structure & MechanicsIt's hard to separate this from the mechanics. This game is a glorified spreadsheet, and it's almost all structure, and no mechanics.Basically, you have a character whose main attribute is stamina. You lose stamina with every meaningful action, and you'll have to sleep on a camp to recover it. There are many camps spread around the map, requiring different resources for you to use them. Some are town inns, which require money, others will simply require different types of food.Then, you'll also visit several towns that specialize in different things. There's alchemy, fishing, hunting, etc. Each requires different tools, which the townsfolk sell you. In those towns, there are also side-quests, that give you money, honor, and resources.Honor is basically used for you to unlock certain quests, that require you to be more trust-worthy.Despite the existence of several different occupations, they're all the same. Once you have a tool and skill (that you get from a quest), the maps will now have a new icon over the resource that you can gather. Then, you click it and there you go. There's no crafting per se. There are some vendors that give you a potions for herbs though, for example.Each action will require tools/resources, and stamina. Some of them also require Hunters, Repair-men, Soldiers, etc. You can buy these (as if mercenary) to help you. As you can tell, the whole game is about getting resource X and either selling or trading it for resource Y, so that you can do the next quest.Hidden-objects ComponentIn every map, there are items spread around, but that are very small and often blend with the background. These are mostly optional, but they can also be useful. These include Mushrooms, Eggs, Lost Crates, etc. These won't be unlocked from the start, you'll unlock them progressively, when following the main quest.Map The maps tells you nothing useful, but let's you fast travel to every location. So, instead of having to waste 2 minutes and 15 clicks, you'll waste 10 seconds and 2 clicks.This is fine, and I think it helps the game substancially. However, it could have been much better. Has different areas have different vendors and quests, it would have been useful to have those marked on the map. Perhaps a little quest description and the person who gave it to you, the main vendors, etc. You can very easily get lost, since you take to memorize everything. Cumbersome systemsEverytime you gather a resource, hunt, etc. you'll lose stamina, and also have a chance to break your tools. If that happens, you'll have to go buy another. Eventually, I just bought every tool twice to avoid backtracking. However, it's very cumbersome, in general. Especially with the later tasks, everything may cost up to half of your stamina. So, you'll travel, do 2 minor things, and have to go back and get more stamina. I think it's mostly unnecessary, how you constantly have to go back and forward... It never lets go of your hand -- Too LinearThe tutorial is very typical of mobile games. You have to click this very specific icon, or else you can't advance. This goes on for a while. While the game opens up a bit, it's also holding you hand. If I had focused only on the story line, it would have bored me to death, probably. It's like the game tells you its story through instructions. ""Do this. Now, do that. Good, now get that to achieve this! No, no that-- this! Here! This shiny button!"" ... It's very, very restrictive. The sidequests help a bit.Regardless, it's never an adventure of your own.Progress and AchievementsThis is the trick about this game. There's an achievement for every meaningless task. It's annoying and patronizing. However, it's one of those psychological tricks that keeps you invested. Everything feels like progress. Also, every field will disappear after being gathered ""x"" times, so there will come a point when you've literally completed the game. And I think that's the strangely compelling thing about this game!It keeps you going for far longer than I'd have guessed. The game has nothing interesting about it, but it still grabs your attention, for those 3 hours!I would not recommend this game, in most circumstances. It's very bland, and has nothing interesting about it. However, it's still compelling. Besides, it provides a good formula. If you can integrate a good story, and some mechanics into it, perhaps a great game can be made!Please, be very aware of what you're getting into. For what it is, it's good!			"

												6.5/10 - RPG Adventure Mixes With Photo Hunt!A fun RPG game that takes you on an epic journey. Your father leaves you in charge of the farm and someone burns it down while you are away. The worst part, now your father is missing. Gameplay mixes in some strategy, collecting and picture hunt elements. You can 100% this campaign in under 3 hours!I constantly see this game on sale for $1, so I would look for it at that price point. This game is pretty fun though and worth more than that.

												It's a mundane, cliche story about a rags to hero kid who defeats the big bad Dark Lord (who uses dark magic, and has a dark voice). There's no challenge or skill involved. It's effectively a glorified storybook where you click a bunch of things to make the story happen, with lots of extra clicks thrown in, between the story bits, in order to artificially inflate the play time.It's not poorly made, but it's not really a great product either.

												This game is very simple and boring. The story is plain, nothing spectacular happens, there is no real character that you can see and therefor you don't see any character progession. The game consists of moving between screens by clicking on arrows, solving quests by clicking on action-bubbles, find and click hard-to-see items in the background and repeat these steps all over again. There is hardly any animation or graphic that is worth talking about.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a wonderful little light RPG disguised as a Hidden Object style game. While undeniably linear, the world is beautifully serene and I actually found myself just leaving the game running as a desktop.The entire adventure takes place from a satellite style view and on each screen of the world there are different activities, shops and quests to do. In addition to the obvious activity bubbles, there are also unmarked collectibles hidden throughout the world. These items for the most part are just another source of income but some also are part of crafting recipes. Everything is as simple as point and click, but rather than being boring it helps to keep the game from overstaying its welcome. The art and sound design is nearly flawless, with my only gripe being a strange soundtrack switch that happens occasionally when navigating through sections of the world and anything faster than a leisurely stroll.The “campaign” in its entirety will only set you back a few hours, but I think it is well worth it for how much detail and care went into this game.

												I started Hero of the Kingdom without any idea of what it was going to be about. I bought it at a good sale price, the single screenshot I saw looked nice, and I don't like to spoil myself with trailers or large numbers of screenshots going into a game. I was immediately put off, thinking that it was going to be an extremely boring hand-holding hidden object adventure. I'm not fond of hidden object games in general, and I hadn't really been expecting to play one when I started. I wasn't actually wrong in my initial impression--Hero of the Kingdom is a really user-friendly point and click adventure with hidden object elements. The thing about this game, though, is that it is the best casual point and click adventure. The game is beautiful, the music is both relaxing and adventurous (and a true pleasure to listen to), and the sound effects feel crisp and fit just right. Tons of polish all around, and you can tell that there was a lot of love put into making this game. Don't go in expecting to find a particularly detailed story, but what is there is enjoyable as well. Again, very simple, but it feels right. This is a game you can enjoy in small pieces, or devour all at once for a relaxing evening. Sometimes it's nice to play something simple and pleasant. Also, the main character solving a lot of problems by being a pretty decent carpenter was oddly refreshing. It's a skill that doesn't really get a lot of serious recognition even in crafting types of games, and it's handled so reasonably and practically within the confines of the story that I couldn't help but smile at moments like finishing construction of the water mill.

												6.6/10 Worth it with the big discount, I'd be feeling a little cheated at full price. Short but fairly engaging game, I burnt through it in a day, but for the price of a sandwich it was still pretty good value.Very simple point-and-clicker with enough story behind it to keep you going. The major drawbacks are the writing has lost a lot in translation, and the level of challenge just isn't high enough.There is no replayability to it once you've strained your eyes finding all the hidden stashes, so it's a one-shot deal.If you enjoy cheap cheasy casuals, this may be for you.

												Hero of the Kingdom is a short point-and-click adventure in a fantasy setting.  The player begins as a farmboy and goes on an adventure by essentially completing errands by interacting with various hotspots on a beautifully drawn map.  More screens are unlocked as one progresses through the story.  In addition to the main story, there are various hidden objects such as mushrooms or lost crates scattered throughout the game world.  These objects blend in well enough that they are not all immediately spotted, but if you should choose to find them all, it's by no means a pixel hunt.Someone looking for an extremely non-challenging and casual gaming experience may enjoy this title.  In fact, I somewhat enjoyed it as something to do while watching television.However, I am unable to recommend this game because of its incredibly short length.  I was able to 100% the game in about four hours. Most of those four hours were spent backtracking.  For instance, while fishing, you may run out of energy.  You must then backtrack to the inn to rest.  You then return to the lake to continue fishing, and you run out of bait.  You must then backtrack to purchase more bait.  And then your rod breaks.  You get the idea.In short, Hero of the Kingdom is not all bad by any means.  It's a decent little game that looks and sounds good, even if it is simplistic.  However, the writing is not so hot.  Unless you are absolutely in love with the genre, there's almost certainly better and more fulfilling ways of spending your time.			"

												The game is just okay. Hero of the Kingdom is a point and click/resource gathering kind of game.  I gave it a thumbs down because you really aren't missing anything here. The highest positive review is out of his mind -  Amazing story? it's a real simple story at best, find your father and defeat evil wizard.  Amazing music? it's a midi track that gets repeated over and over, I turned down the volume and listended to my own music.  The biggest con is the game is almost completely linear until maybe halfway through where you can start doing random quests.  Gold farming was kind of annoying.  The game is short, but if you're an achievement hunter it might take you an extra hour or so to find the hidden items like myself.  If you're on the fence about this game, I say skip it. 5/10			"

												I feel like this game has its ups and downs but honestly I would not recommend it.The art style is very nice, every scene is drawn with great detail and you can really tell the artists put a lot of time and effort into it being a rather pretty game and I feel that's what it accomplished. The music is also pretty catchy too.With that being said, I played this game for a while and appreciated what it was going for but I felt like the type of game it was trying to be is rather dated; It has a storyline, somewhat, you're drawn in for the first hour and a half or so, but then you realize you are just pointing and clicking things for the sake of pointing and clicking them. I was waiting for a moment in the game for it to come out and be more, but it never happened.Honestly, if you enjoy ""Point and Click"" games  by all means this is the game for you, but just a little warning, you better love pointing and clicking for the sake of pointing and clicking, or else you will probably fall under my category of somewhat displeased consumers that want more than a somewhat Farmville-ish game.

												In this game you get to follow a story of a young man(?) seeking for his father. You do not really get to be this young man, because while he is facing challenges, you are not. I like to play as the character, so i was disappointed by the fact, that i didn't get to be ""a hero"".The gameplay is all about point and click, without any need to hurry. There is no difficulty what so ever. No challenges to face for you. You can't lose.Well, actually you can lose something. You can lose your valuable time, by playing this game.The story is so basic, it hurts. It is basically at the level of a bad children's book story, aimed at little boys who do not wish to see any romance. None of the characters in the game have a personality, just a rough background story at most.This game is TOO casual.I recommend this for nobody.Ah, the good parts? It looks pretty and the music was okay.			"

There is a great progression between a mundane task and some storyline to accompany it.  The storyline is what this game is all about, as all actions are basically clicking something.  All in all, if you're looking for a quieter game for a low price, this one should do it for you.			"

												This is a casual Resource Management game. I mean casual by both slow-paced and easy to beat.The Good :- Simple, Relaxing gameplay.- Resource Management. It's one of my loved genre, but there isn't much games focused on that.- More and more things interactable on maps as you progress.- Lots of bonus loots hidden everywhere, for extra coins.- Map interface allowing you to travel anywhere you've been. It's helpful as you'll be travelling everywhere.The Bad :- Remember, this is NO RPG or STRATEGY. All about handling resources and clicking tiny hidden things.- One playthrough's enough for all achievement. 3 hours for me to get them all.- Management gets too easy once you found out a way to make money.- You never know when you don't need tools anymore(Resource nodes will decay in one or two gathers, and are limited. But don't worry that you can BUY resources from NPCs)- Interaction effects. I'd really love to skip them.- Bulk purchase option needed. It's tiresome to click hundred times when shopping.6/10, Well worth the price, but not too great. And they're making the sequel so I'd like to play it as well.比較的スローペースで簡単な、資源管理ゲー。良い点：・シンプルで遊びやすく、必要なアイテムはアイコン表示なので英語力もそれほど必要ではない。・資源管理の楽しさ。ストラテジー以外でその辺を重視したゲームってあまりない。・進行に合わせてマップ中にあるインタラクト可能なオブジェクトが増えるので、何度か立ち寄って変化を見に行くのが楽しめる。・各所に隠されたボーナスアイテム。・ファストトラベル可能な地図。相当な頻度でマップを移動することになるのでありがたい。悪い点：・RPG要素も戦闘要素も無く、ただ資源を消費・獲得したり、小さなオブジェクトを探してクリックするだけ。・リプレイ性はなく、1週で全実績が取れる。・金策手段を見つけると、(時間はかかるが)一気にゲームが簡単になる・いつツールが不要になるか分からない(リソースノードは1，2回調べると無くなるため有限だが、足りないなら店でいくらでも買える)・インタラクト時のエフェクト。何十回もキャンプで休息してると昼夜エフェクトを飛ばしたくなる。・NPCとの取引で大量購入/売却するオプションが欲しい。何百回もクリックする必要があるのは困る。スコア6/10、定価分は楽しめるとは思う。続編が開発中なのでやりたい。			"

												One of the negative reviews calls this an RPG for people who hate RPGs, which isn't unfair, but also isn't necessarily a bad thing. The story is an archetypal (read: generic) WRPG, but with casual gameplay based on gathering resources to earn money and solve quests. For combat, you're required to gather certain weapons, health potions, allies, etc., but you don't actually play through the combat itself, and there's no risk of losing or death.Recommended for fans of hidden object games and the exploration parts of isometric RPGs. Not recommended if you're looking for an actual RPG.			"

												This game is not spectacular.  It\'s not Mass effect, it\'s not dragon age.  The video is pretty clear as to what it is.  It\'s a little tedious at points.  Money can be tricky and some of the clickables are hard to see.  There are some \'quality of life\' changes i\'d love to see (for example, a short cut to sell all of an item at once.  The ability to go \'oops, that\'s one item too many!\'... etc)but generally?  This was a really fun little game to spend an evening with :)  Don\'t make any great expectations and you\'ll have a good time. :)I would also say that this game is kid friendly and might be a great game for your little ones.

												I've acquired this one after playing the second part, as I had nice time with title. I wasn't disappointed. I don't like Hogs or adventure games but this mix with rpg and strategy elements is a good mixture. This game is not worth 6 Euro, especially with almost no replay value, but fortunately it comes in bundles or sales pretty often and as such I highly recommend it, it is a very nice experience for two, three evenings. Also worth mentioning multiplatform support, low requirements and steam cards and achievements.			"

												Just finished this game with 100% achievments at around 5 hours. I know that doesn't seem like a lot of time but i do think its a fair amount for how the game actually plays. I mean how much time is taken up in RPGs just buy running for example.I thoroughly enjoyed this game and found it quite cute, and the bartering system was real cool as well. Finding ways to make money to buy the things needed to progress, giving you multiple options of how to acquire the gold, and some items, was cool as well.The story is a nice twist on the classic save the world hero theme and captured me from the start.Like a lot of other people, upon first look it looked like a cheesey facebook game, but i listened to the positive reviews that it is an actual game and it was definitely worth it.Im not a fan of Hidden Item games but the way it is implimented into this one makes the game more enjoyable.The soundtrack also matches the game and sets the scenes nicely.All of this adds up to be a nice non linear-ish chill adventure game that is a great addition to anyones library whether or not you want to slam it out in 4-6 hours flat, or do multiple 30min sessions after long days before bed time like I did.I do think $7 is an alright price to pay, though I do think $5 is more appropriate, i guess it depends how much you get out of playing it and how long it takes. If it took 7 hours, thats $1 for an hour, and not bad, if it took 3.5 hours, thats $2, still not bad.I got this on sale for probably $4-5 and i think it was worth.			"

												A GemDespite being relatively short, with standard complete quest, get reward, rinse and repeat, this game delivers. It starts out linear but branches out as you get going.Pros:Tried and true formula.Plenty of rewards.Side quests.Time flies by as you play.Little that is offensive.Inexpensive. (Even at current full price of $6.99 US, would be even more of a deal on sale or with a coupon.)Cons:Dated graphics.Not terribly long (a day or two of gameplay).Some objects are really tiny on the screen.All in all, a very nice indie RPG.

												Just finished it in 5 hours, so for total game time, I'd say that's pretty much the time it takes to finish the game, and all the achievements. That being said, shows a bit of replayability value. there isn't much to do once you're done. completely. Finish the last achievements, find some more mushrooms, sleep with meat a few more times, and trade until you have 5000 gold in total. But, it's like finishing a pokemon game completely. Finding all the pokemon, and levelling them to the max. Restarting the game from scratch seems like a waste to the time it took, and the story/adventure won't change much.Graphic wise, it's quite good. Not too new of a graphics, but how all areas have small hidden things, like hidden pearls, and mushrooms in them (that you sometimes unlock by becoming a better herbalist) makes each area new, and abundant!The story itself isn't too impressive. but it's fun, and not only can you quite often start doing side quests, and unlock special areas, you can also continue the story, and 2 screens further, another small bit of story is available, so almost all screens have a special story part. This means it's easily focussable on the next challenge, and you won't get lost in the quests and finding the solutions.Gameplay: Gameplay in this game is what really drives the game itself forward. A lot of items that are clickable do not have an actually specific picture, like the trader, or a quest giver does. Sometimes, it's just a simple mushroom in the middle of a forest, that you can click. This means sometimes, boredly looking around actually rewards you. The actual movements aren't great, but it's kind of fun to see soldiers changing position, a few arrows all pointing towards a single enemy, and then moving on. Also, even though you're probably the same size as a normal npc in the game, the fact that you don't see yourself on screen kind of helps the immersion. YOU are the one that checks out the little clearing in the forest, to see if you can help save the lumberjack, and you are the one that decides to attack the boar. Strangely enough, if you would be a few pixels on the screen, you'd be too small to matter, but now, you really do.Basically, I recommend it. I think since it's not too high in replayability, it's probably better to wait for a sale, but there's no definitive need for it. It's just a fun little game, that you can enjoy, until you're completely done.			"

												Good casual game.  Reasonable story doled out in small parcels makes you want to read it and gets you involved in the game.   It's pretty easy but not simplistic - you have to pay attention to the screen.  The hardest achievements are the egg/lost barrel and mushroom collections - these items are very tiny and tend to blend into the background which is why you have to pay attention.  There's a resource management aspect to the game (not hard to manage) and a series of ""mini fetch quests"" for the most part, again fairly easy.You would think a game littered with ""easy fetch this and fetch that"" would be boring/tediuos.  This game has managed to strike a nice balance.  Just when it starts to get tedious the game ends.  Buy it on sale.  One play through is about 6 hours.  There's no replayability.   "

												This game is amazing, it is short so I finished it in one sitting but I still haven't gotten all the achivements.+ This game has made it's cliche run of the mill story into something pretty good.+ This game has some nice side quests which don't seem to be required for completing the main story.+ This game has a nice map system which makes moving around easy.+ This game has a great soundtrack.+ The artstyle of the game isn't anything special but I like it.+ The game's lenght seems to be perfect.- This game might get repetative for some people, though I didn't have any problems with it.- This game might be fustrating for people who have to complete all achivements as alot of them require you to find the items dotted across the map and backround.I heavily recommend this game if you think it's too expensive right now, wait for a sale.9/10			"

												A very casual resource management game.  Picked this up in a bundle and decided to install and play based on the art and was completely surprised by it.  I thought after clearing the initial area the tutorial-esque prompts would lessen, but no, not really, it's basically how the game works.Most of the game is based on needing x amount of item a,b,c to accomplish z.  This sounds boring and repetitive, but for some reason, I really enjoyed it.  Maybe it was the art direction or how low-taxing it is, but I played this for like a half and hour on my first start-up and then spent the next day waiting to get home to play it again.  It's a short game and I think I finished it over the next two days.  There was something chill and captivating about this game and I really enjoyed despite it being very simple in design and execution.  The English translation can also be awfully stiff at times.I think most people would find this game boring, but I definitely enjoyed this and will probably pick the sequel that is currently in the works when it comes out.  Maybe the casual pastoral resource management genre is my thing.			"

												This is a casual Resource Management game. I mean casual by both slow-paced and easy to beat.The Good :- Simple, Relaxing gameplay.- Resource Management. It's one of my loved genre, but there isn't much games focused on that.- More and more things interactable on maps as you progress.- Lots of bonus loots hidden everywhere, for extra coins.- Map interface allowing you to travel anywhere you've been. It's helpful as you'll be travelling everywhere.The Bad :- Remember, this is NO RPG or STRATEGY. All about handling resources and clicking tiny hidden things.- One playthrough's enough for all achievement. 3 hours for me to get them all.- Management gets too easy once you found out a way to make money.- You never know when you don't need tools anymore(Resource nodes will decay in one or two gathers, and are limited. But don't worry that you can BUY resources from NPCs)- Interaction effects. I'd really love to skip them.- Bulk purchase option needed. It's tiresome to click hundred times when shopping.6/10, Well worth the price, but not too great. And they're making the sequel so I'd like to play it as well.比較的スローペースで簡単な、資源管理ゲー。良い点：・シンプルで遊びやすく、必要なアイテムはアイコン表示なので英語力もそれほど必要ではない。・資源管理の楽しさ。ストラテジー以外でその辺を重視したゲームってあまりない。・進行に合わせてマップ中にあるインタラクト可能なオブジェクトが増えるので、何度か立ち寄って変化を見に行くのが楽しめる。・各所に隠されたボーナスアイテム。・ファストトラベル可能な地図。相当な頻度でマップを移動することになるのでありがたい。悪い点：・RPG要素も戦闘要素も無く、ただ資源を消費・獲得したり、小さなオブジェクトを探してクリックするだけ。・リプレイ性はなく、1週で全実績が取れる。・金策手段を見つけると、(時間はかかるが)一気にゲームが簡単になる・いつツールが不要になるか分からない(リソースノードは1，2回調べると無くなるため有限だが、足りないなら店でいくらでも買える)・インタラクト時のエフェクト。何十回もキャンプで休息してると昼夜エフェクトを飛ばしたくなる。・NPCとの取引で大量購入/売却するオプションが欲しい。何百回もクリックする必要があるのは困る。スコア6/10、定価分は楽しめるとは思う。続編が開発中なのでやりたい。			"

												This game is top of the line when it comes to games involving clicking lots of things, It is kinda neat how it tells a story through it all. But for the most part, all you're doing is memorizing where to buy/sell various items, and adding in some hidden items that you gotta find and click on as well. Music/sound/visuals are all par for the course within the price category.If you really want a very casual game that you can click through in 3 hours, I could honestly recommend this game. However, I can't leave a positive review in good conscience for such a mind-numbing genre.			"

Still, if you want to unwind and play a very casual game, this one's for you. However, for most of gamers I know, they'll be a bit disappointed. I expect to play it for another 60 minutes and then never look at it again.			"

												Would be a great game if we were still in the 90sLooks like a HD remaster of some game from that time. Repetitive music, static graphics (seriously, there aren`t even battle animations or whatever) and long, static paragraphs of text.  Reminds me a lot of Tibia, the MMORPGBUTI suppose its nostalgic, right? I mean, the graphics can throw you off quite a bit in the beginning and OH SO MUCH RAILROADING, but its a classic solo rpg, in the end. With half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics and storytelling to boot. (seriously the story branches off in a million directions that end up being just sidequests. Its like Skyrim except its all ""gather me twenti fishe :) "") Its not absolute trash, I still play it. And it WAS like $0,99 anyways so I guess its not retchableBad. but not unplayable. 4/10			"

												I know, very low priced game etc. But for 6 euros, you can have some of the best games on steam, and even for 1 €, you have games with replay value during the sales so... No :The pros :+ Old school graphics+Gameplay+Game beggining asking you to think about the budget+Perfectly translated in French and, I assume, in other languages+Easy to achieve all the trophies in less than 5 hoursThe cons :-The childish writing, too much innocent to be interesting-Scenario very cliche (no spoil but, the twists are so dumb, sorry...)-The very uninteresting characters and lore (despite the lizard / frog men, but you'll meet them only once)-5 hours maximum to finish it, and I didn't rush through it. Althought it can be a good point if, like me, you don't like the game-No replay value-Again, I was so annoyed by the texts and the scenario, too too dumb. Maybe if you are 10 or 12 it's ok but... "

												This isn't by any means a bad game, but it doesn't really have much going for it, either. This feels like a point-and-click adventure, where the only thing you can click is progression (or a collectible). For me, at least, the point of point-and-click games is puzzling your way through it, rather than mindlessly clicking whatever bright gold sparkly icon shows up next on the screen. The little hidden object collectibles are interesting, and I think probably the thing that kept me playing the longest, since they respawn after enough time has passed.I would like to acknowledge that the music in this is actually pretty fantastic, though. There are definitely a few things about this game that are amazingly well implemented (fast travel through that map? THANK YOU), and while this feels like a completed game, it just doesn't feel very compelling. The stilted dialogue doesn't help, either. Especially when the boy is all ""I have to revenge my father!"" That may have been the deciding factor for my not recommending this, actually.			"

												This game is top of the line when it comes to games involving clicking lots of things, It is kinda neat how it tells a story through it all. But for the most part, all you're doing is memorizing where to buy/sell various items, and adding in some hidden items that you gotta find and click on as well. Music/sound/visuals are all par for the course within the price category.If you really want a very casual game that you can click through in 3 hours, I could honestly recommend this game. However, I can't leave a positive review in good conscience for such a mind-numbing genre.			"

It is a bit tedious from time to time, the story is forgettable and it is a facebook game a la farmville without the additional waiting time. I still enjoyed it enough to finish it. But I also didn't payed full price and received it as part of a bundle. If you're looking for a game where you don't have to think and just need to klick on a few things and search some pictures for mushrooms and treasures, it's most certainly a good pickup. Tune in your favorite podcast and get lost in thoughts. I still wouldn't recommend it for the full price since it's just not entertaining enough for 7 bucks.

												Some simple stuff in this game: Gather this and that, trade this for that, keep a lookout for hidden objects in the scenery, rest when necessary; yet it never really grows old on you.I don't know what else to say really, it's a surprisingly addictive game. And even though the main gameplay consists of gathering, trading and doing quests, the inclusion of some objects hidden cleverly in plain view makes for a game that keeps you engaged.The story is pretty standard, but it's not bad by any means. And whether or not you're into the tropes of RPGs, the simple beauty of the graphics will certainly sway you.I don't know why it's so charming, but I don't care really. This is a good game. And it's certainly worth five dollars. But if you're unsure, get it on a sale. If you like these kinds of games, you'll not regret it.Edit::I still recommend this game for its simple charm, but I should warn you that it's a very casual game. I managed to beat it in about three and a half hours, and earn the remaining achievements in 15 minutes. Granted, I'm the kind of guy who used to pick up Dark Souls and play it casually, so take from that what you want. Still, my point stands: This is a fairly easy game. But that doesn't make it bad. So again: Still recommended.			"

												This game can be a bit confusing and even boring at the beggining but after you play for a while and start to figure out how the mechanics goes it can surely become very interesting. The story itself is pretty classic, there's not exceptional to be added. Either way, it's enough to keep you motivated to carry on. As for the gameplay, I guess I'd call it a ""resource manager RPG"", especially because most of the time you need to go after this or after that in order to complete the given quests that are required to advance further on the story. The graphics are ok and the soundtrack can get old after a while so it's not a bad idea to have your own playlist available. There're also the trading cards and the achievements, so it's needless to say that it brings some added value. Overall, if you enjoy the casual genre, this title is for you.			"

												“Ugh another lame indie game” is the same thought that crosses my mind every-time I open something like Hero of the Kingdom; so needless to say I'm more than mildly surprised when I realized this game wasn’t just tolerable but actually slightly addictive. The simplicity and grindyness was just enough to keep me moving through the game, despite the fact that the story was equally simply and grindy. Really the only way to describe Hero of the Kingdom is an RPG with the most streamlined approach you could imagine without being Press Space RPG. Its really only good for one play-through; the $5.99 price-tag is on the high end of what its worth, buy I wouldn’t hesitate to drop $1 to $4 on this game. Definitely worth a shot if you have the addictive RPG looting mentality.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a point-and-click role-playing game.  It's more casual and story-driven than the average role-playing game.  It is well-written and comes together naturally.  After this game you could buy the sequel that's similar but has a different character and storyline.  Since the game is more casual, you have plenty of time to make decisions.  I recommend it for people looking for a relaxing, story-driven role-playing game or someone that wants to try something different in the role-playing genre.			"

												This is one of those casual games that has just enough complexity to keep a child of eight years entertained. It's pretty much a clickfest with a ""I'm a farmboy and I must save my dad!"" story. No real 'combat' or 'crafting', just 'Make sure you have enough things to do the thing before you try the thing'. There's a little bit of ""hidden object"" gameplay thrown in as well, and as small as these objects are, they still pop out well enough if you know what you're looking for.It's short, it's sweet, it's not-perfectly translated from Slovak. Buy it if you have kids, or even for yourself if you're suffering from just the teensiest bit of MMORPG ennui.			"

												“Ugh another lame indie game” is the same thought that crosses my mind every-time I open something like Hero of the Kingdom; so needless to say I'm more than mildly surprised when I realized this game wasn’t just tolerable but actually slightly addictive. The simplicity and grindyness was just enough to keep me moving through the game, despite the fact that the story was equally simply and grindy. Really the only way to describe Hero of the Kingdom is an RPG with the most streamlined approach you could imagine without being Press Space RPG. Its really only good for one play-through; the $5.99 price-tag is on the high end of what its worth, buy I wouldn’t hesitate to drop $1 to $4 on this game. Definitely worth a shot if you have the addictive RPG looting mentality.			"

												From the looks of it, I expected some sort of uninspired Sacred-clone in this game. Instead, I found a little gem of low level fantasy, I happily advise to anyone who likes the genre. Your young hero's task is not to save the world, but to wander the homesteads around his (okay, some clichées are hard to avoid) burned home to rescue his father.In a game, that would be best described as ressource management, you'll find yourself in a mundane atmosphere of people and a world, that don't necessarily turn around you. The gameplay can be broken down to ""use thing A to complete task B"", plus a bit of hidden object finding. Nothing too challenging, but on the other side nothing that's too distracting from the nice atmosphere, the game creates.Hero of the Kingdom is a refreshing casual experience, I hereby want to recommend.

												If you love click-a-thons then this game is for you. If you're like me, then you'll find this game severely lacking.The only reason the player is even needed is to click to proceed to the next batch of tasks. The story is thin. There is enough to provide background, but not enough to draw you into your character or to keep you driven in fulfilling your assigned tasks.After only four hours I finished the game and nabbed almost all the achievements. If I hadn't bought this game on sale I would have been completely miffed. To be perfectly honest, the only reason I continued to play the game to completion is that I thought the ending might be worth the tedium. Even though I was wrong about getting a worthy payoff, at least the trading cards were worth the effort.			"

												This is a fun and relaxing game where you follow a young boy on his quest to find his dad after some bandits burned down your farm. On the way you will help others and get rewarded with gold and knowledge, that help you gather and use the resources of the land. On the way you will become the Hero the Kingdom needs.Its a basic click and point game, but it has a nice charm to it. It reminds me a lot of how I saw on adventure and heroes growing up. I played Hero of the Kingdom II before I got my hands on Hero of the Kingdom and its about the same game. Since I liked the Hero of the Kingdom II I was happy. I played for 4 hours and got all the achievements. Pick it up if you want a game that everyone with a basic knowledge of english can enjoy. Only negativ is that the last few eggs and mushrooms are hard to find, so I spent about half an hour on that.			"

Which you will go to if you recommended this game as anything other than 'might be worth picking up as the 7th game in a bundle package'.[/end drama]Do you like clicking on stuff? Playing find-the-item? Banal, uninspired writing? Look no further!If you're looking for challenge of any kind, look elsewhere. There are other time/resource management games that do all of the above a lot better. Gods Will Be Watching comes to mind. Even Tribloos has some challenge to it, at least.This is a quintessential Big Fish games game. Like that one about chocolate. Or the wild west one. Don't worry: in a week or two, you'll have completely forgotten the name of this one as well. Such is the life of the muzak games. That should really be a category. Maybe I'll write Steam.			"

												I have to give this game a negative because the grind for gold is mind-numbingly stupid. You have to wait for the graphics sequence for each bag of wheat converted into flour. If this could be done in bulk this conversion would be tolerable, but as it is, it's just eating valuable time and it's not even though any skill is required, just waiting for the animation to complete.

												Good: - Actually pretty fun - Graphics are real nice, and as simple as they need to be - Not too grindy at all, but not easy enough to be boring - CheapBad: - Not really long, 100% achievements in 3.5 hours without a guide - Story is boring, so I skipped all dialogue (personal opinion, nothing against the game) - Not really an overview of what the point is or where I'm aiming for. Sort of just have to go with the game without a clue (probably a fault of me not following the story)Overall:Honestly? This game was a lot better than I was giving it credit for. If the developer can take the great parts of this game, which is most of it, and turn it into better experiences with higher budgets, they really could see a lot of success.It's worth your time and money8/10			"

												This game looks like nothing or your typical everyday facebook game, but in fact it's quite funny to click through the story and unfold your own story by fullfilling tasks, killing enemies or just go fishing. What's most enjoyable is your total freedom what or when to do the things you want to do. There is a storyline under all these things but you can freely choose what or what not to do to get to the end. You could even don't care for the story at all and just go hunting in the woods or become a herbalist or fisherman.On top of that there are different objects hidden in the very detailed landscapes that can be found like mushrooms, garbage or different kinds of loot, even treasures can be found. Again it's up to you if you want to go searching for these things or doing something else.If you're not sure how to rate this game then download the demo and give it a chance. I think it's worth the money. When it's on discount for e.g. 4,99 € I recommend you to buy this indie gem.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a mix of different genres, RPG, Hidden Object, Clicker, Point and Click, and it doesn't go into any depth for any of them, yet, the formula seems to work, as I sat down and played through it in one sitting without losing interest.You play a farmer's son who needs to go on a quest to rescue your father after an encounter with bandits. As you explore, more of the map opens up, you discover crafting, magic, and the ability to level up, none of these is in any depth however, and the toughest challenge you will face is managing your economy, as most quests require objects that more often than not, require gold to obtain. So exploring whether or not hunting, herb gathering, fishing, delivery services etc. are enough to earn a profit is about the only learning curve in the game. Many resources are hidden within the world, giving it a slight hidden object vibe, but they aren't very difficult.The graphics are good for the type of game it is, the music fits the theme, and the hours role by. Rather than playing the game for a challenge, you play the game for the story or for the satisfaction you get from completing quests and checking them off your list. Hero of the Kingdom offers casual, stress-free gameplay, and is worth the journey.			"

												A game seemingly about resource gathering and such, in which you can't gather resources except for a very few scripted places. In the tutorial the game asks you to chop down some trees with your axe to obtain wooden planks – standard stuff. But after that, the only option to get them is to BUY them – despite travelling through large forests.The gold/inventory management is also an illusion, because you always have just enough total money to buy some required items and proceed. Even when you join the army, you have to buy your own weapons and armour. This is a capitalist's wet dream.You basically click through the whole game and you can't deviate from the current objective or you'll get stuck with not enough money and no way to earn more (not that the game gives you such freedom anyway).It's all just incredibly lazy. Even some visual novels seem to have more gameplay. Stay away.			"

												If you're looking for an extremely casual game then you're in the right place.  It's a basic point and click RPG whereas you're a Farmer's son asked to look after the farm while he leaves to take care of business.  Of course tragedy occurs after a day, or so of your Father leaving the farm. You are forced to travel out into a strange and unfamiliar world with your simple farming equipment to help you along your way to Heroism.The difficulty of the game is simply where to find what, or how to get what in the game and the balancing of money vs. resources. If you need a specific resource and don't have enough tools to farm it, you can buy it for a price naturally. *hint* the resources of this game is limited, so don't sell it all off if you don't need to. I've made a complete game walkthrough with 100% achievement, i'll post the link once I am finished rendering and uploading that series.My two only complaints: Quest list & Vitality Restoration ProcessQuest list: There is none, you either have to remember what you have to do, or do one task at a time.Vitality Restoration: Takes a long time with no way of skipping the, ""scene,"" you'll hear me say skip to the next video with ~10minutes left because all I was doing was restoring my vitality.(no vit bar btw, so people can abuse that just fyi if a dev comes along and reads this)			"

												Nice little game. Got it on sale and finished it within about 4 hours with all achievements in two sittings (and then I only stopped for food). It’s a nice, casual point and click type of adventure, with elements of hidden objects. Your task is to save the Kingdom by completing various quests, with most of these quests requiring you to find or buy certain items. You collect herbs and mushrooms. Fish and hunt and even take part in a few battles. Everything you do is fairly self-explanatory. Don’t expect epic gameplay, but for a casual game to while away a few hours this really does the job. The simplistic and casual style may not be for everyone though. The game is also a bit too short. In summary I’d say it’s a good game to get while on sale.			"

												This isn't really an RPG- it's more a point-and-click adventure story/hidden object game. It's short,  linear and there's almost no possibility of failure. Gameplay is simply a matter of ""find obstacle, collect the items to pass obstacle, pass obstacle, rinse and repeat"". The bulk of the challenge is simply juggling the barter system to obtain the objects you need or working out how to get enough gold to proceed.That said, the game is moderately entertaining as a short-term time-waster and actually tells a surprisingly decent, if shallow, story of how your ordinary farmboy rises up to become the savior of the land. It's not original by any means, but it's very back-to-basics. If you're a completionist or achievement hound then there are a fair few challenges to kill time, but I beat it with 100% completion in about 4 hours at most (quite a lot of which was spent searching for those DAMNED last few eggs). I can't in good faith call it a ""good game"" but I don't have the heart to give it a downvote- even if plot and gameplay were both very shallow, it was cheap and it entertained me for a while and it had a peculiar charm to it. So as long as you don't expect too much, I guess I can give it a casual recommendation.			"

												This is a very casual rpg game using point and click interactions. There are some side quests in the game, and a simple plotline that's easy to follow. I honestly didn't expect much when I started playing, but the game was surprisingly easy to immerse yourself into. The game itself calls for some degree of knowing how to utilize your current resources, and planning out how to gain future resources. And the constant to and fro barter system, along with seeking out resources along the map, might seem a tad tedious to some people. But, all in all, I would say that this is the game for someone looking for some relaxing and fun gaming.			"

Graphics are okay, no voiceovers, no animations, no cutscenes or anything else you would expect from a game released in 2012.I really dont know why this is good at all, but if you want to sink 4-6 hours into a rather forgettable casual gaming experience you probably cannot do much better than this one, it somehow end up being a lot fun!

												Not really an adventure game, it's a hidden object game.  There is no real strategy since choice is so limited.  It's just doing a ton of busywork that wears out its welcome.  It's a good looking game, which is imperative given the hidden objects like mushrooms, eggs, and treasures.  So if you want to get all the achievements, it requires scanning a lot of screens.  It's rather short, it's cheap, and the story is okay.  It's also annoyingly repetitive, constrictive, and requires thousands of clicks and nothing more.  5/10			"

												Graphics: ★Gameplay: ★Story: ★★Music&Sounds: ★★Atmosphere: ★Fun: ★===> 8/10 Rating*************************************************When I first got this game I expected maybe 1 hour of gameplay. In the end I ended up taking 4 hours and 20 minutes to finish the story of the game, and I yet have to get all the achievements. Graphics are okay for the type of game it is, the music and sounds are amazing, the gameplay itself is a tad boring after a while and the game itself very linear - there is not too much choice in what to do, but you can choose the order and how detailed you play. The overall atmosphere is decent, and the story is extremely detailed, long and sometimes even takes unexpected turns or continues when you believe for it to be over.All together this is the most fun point&click game I have played so far and I definetely recommend it to anyone who likes games with excellent story and point&click adventure style!

												There is no way on earth this game should be fun but it some how is. Basically you are just clicking things. You need an axe to chop a tree. Find an axe. The craftsman has axe but he won't sell it to you.You need 10 apples to make the craftsman like you!Click on a few apple trees.You have 10 apples.Give the apples to the craftsman.He likes you. You can now buy an axe.And so on. But somehow, this is actually any good. Maybe it's just soothing? The relentless parade of success must trigger the right brain responses.

												This game was suprisingly good.  Got this game in a bundle and wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised.You take control of a young man and solve many different problems that plague the kingdom, culminating in defeating the main villian.  The story is not original, but is paced very nicely and actually plays out interestingly.  Finding all the objects and figuring out the solutions to issues is not all that difficult, but does remain interesting.  The graphics are also fairly pretty.The only cons I would have to mention are the lack of plot twists, and the relatively short play time (took me 5 hours).  While I wouldn't pay 7$ for this game, I would pay 4$ or under and still feel like I got my money's worth.			"

												For a point and click game where I did an awful lot of fishing, I had a blast.  I can't put my finger on what it was, but it hooked me in and I had to get every achievement.  Took about 3 hrs to beat.			"

												This game is a fun little time waster that can be played casually in about 3 hours. Add in the searching for items and collection you probably get another hourish or so out of it. The story is pretty cut and paste but enjoyable for the way the game plays. Collecting the achievements towards the end, the mushrooms in particular, was difficult because of their lack of distinction from the map pallet colors. Still a fun short game. Sadly not replayable.			"

What I Liked- The gameplay was an interesting blend of Point-and-Click RPG and Hidden Object genres.  I had a great time with both aspects, though I'd be hard-pressed to choose which I liked more!- I really enjoyed playing Hero of the Kingdom.  I hear there is a sequel on the way, and looking forward to playing it!What I Disliked- This game was pretty short.  Expect to put in 4-6 hours, depending on how quickly you can read and whether or not you get all of the Steam achivements.- There were a misspelled word or two in the dialog, and a small handful of grammatical errors (English language).

												Steam really needs a ""neutral"" rec setting, dang. Okay so... this is as generic as fantasy-setting games get, story-wise, and it is painfully simple gameplay that ultimately you can't fail; you can screw up specific actions (hunting, crafting) and break gear but you have more than enough resources at your disposal to make up for that. The biggest difficulty comes in trying to track down the last few random gathering items to finish out all your achievements before you go defeat the Dark Lord (yes). There's a discussion thread where people have shared locations of some of the tricky-to-find items, though, which helped me.Buy this game if it's on sale (I paid $1.25), you have nothing to do for an afternoon, and you get enough satisfaction out of 100% completion that you don't need compelling story or gameplay to back that up.

												A beginner's adventure game for young people. NOT recommended for teens/adults. It's basically like a hidden object game where you search out and collect resources until you have enough to complete open quest objectives, which open further quests and resources to search for. It does not require any kind of skill or reflexes beyond being able to point and click the mouse, and you basically cannot fail unless you can't figure out extremely rudimentary logic puzzles. There is NO replay value, and can be completed in a few hours. But as I say, would be appropriate for a young person new to adventure gaming.			"

												I've really enjoyed this game. I beat it from start to finish in about 6 hours of actual playtime, so it's quite short. The game flows very well and the story is nice. It has a very strange way of pulling you in. For the first 30 minutes of the game I felt like I was going to be bored and was wondering if I'd continue playing it, and also felt that it was a bit simple and small... And then I quickly realized how mistaken I was when the world opened up. My mind went from thinking that everything was small scale and simple to, ""Oh my god this is going to take me forever to explore all of this.""There's quite a lot of easy achievements in the game if you're an achievement hunter. Overall this game is well worth the price. It doesn't really have any replay value, but it's worth the money especially if you get it in a bundle or when it's on sale. I'm very eager to play the 2nd as I enjoyed this one very much and will be looking for future work from this developer.This game does a good job of giving you instant gratification and making you want to play from start to finish in one go. It might take some a bit longer, especially if they're trying to go for all of the achievements or if they're trying to reveal the story to all of the side quests instead of just trying to complete the main story. I wouldn't imagine it has any more than 10 hours of total solid gameplay though, but still well worth full price in my opinion. I have nothing negative to say about this game, it's just so well constructed in a very surprisingly simple weird way. I loved it.10/10 will be buying the sequal and will be looking for future games from this developer.			"

												I'm really not sure about reviews that call this a 'clicker' game of the Clicker Heroes/Adventure Capitalist ilk. This is nothing like those. Yes, fundamentally, you just click. But that's true of Monkey Island and Minesweeper, and no one would call those clickers.Now that I've got that off of my chest, time for the real review. This game borrows heavily from 90's D&D-based CRPGs. It's got the same visual style, and the same sort of subquests, gathering, improving skills and back-and-forth. But it doesn't have any of the D&D elements of those games. You're not roleplaying, managing your inventory or obsessing over stats. It's a simple, quick, fun waste of time. And sometimes, those are just what you want.I wouldn't pay full price for it, but see it on sale or in a bundle? Snap it up.			"

												I had fun playing this game. That's all about I can say. You just point and click the entire game. Do errands for people to advance and get more and more items. That's it. It's follows a simple and ""cliched"" story, like the old rpg games. I liked, and people shouldn't expect more. The art reminds me of the classic old games, and for a 2D style it's pretty good, with lots of details (especially if you're willing to find all the items, like I did, to get 100% on the achievements). Nevertheless, the choice of music is really good, I fell in love with this game because of the music chosen for each scenery. So, overall, it's a good game. Simple and enjoyable.			"

												Not quite sure how to categorize Hero of the Kingdom. It's part point-and-click adventure, part interactive story (but effectively linear), part resource management, part ""hidden items,"" part collection quest, _none_ of those genres i particularly care for. Nonetheless, i thoroughly enjoyed the casual, at-your-own-pace nature of this game, as well as the music, the interface (trivial to use), and theme. It's short - i played through it in a single sitting of (Steam says) just under 6  hours (didn't bother to go for 100% of achievements). Combat is unique in that in order to fight, you have to collect certain resources (one of which is fatigue (which is collected by resting)), at which point success is guaranteed. Will i play it again? i might. In terms of cost-per-hour it's already paid for itself, though, and there's nothing left to do in the game except go for the 100% achievements (but i'm not quite that OCD). The next day i went searching for more and promptly found Hero of the Kingdom 2, so it seems that my Saturday is now booked.			"

												I find this game relaxing yet adictive.you can't go wrong for the price of french fries.Try the demo, if you like it, <$2 is well worth it, unless you are looking for fast paced combat!Basically it is a resorce management game within a common, good vs evil story.It may seem as if you can go where you want, when you want, but eventually, you are guided from A to B to C etc.There is a bit of hidden object to it where you try to find very minute things hidden in the landscape, which can give you a lot of inventory. speaking of which, the hardest part is remembering who buys and sell what. although getting around is easy, your quests require certain items to accomplish (including rest). vendors and quest points are well labeled, but where did they sell that tool I just broke? you are never seen nor have to walk across the screen, just click on the place with an icon and you are there, or the map system will instantly transport you across the world.the trick is keeping your funds up by using tools to aquire items that are hopefully worth more than the tools, and knowing where to use or sell them.

												This isn't a puzzle game, its a point and click adventure. There's no avatar to move around, you just click on stuff. Pretty cool if you just wanna chill out and kick back.I got this in a bundle and figured I wouldn't like it, but I gave it a shot, and its pretty cool. I enjoyed the 3.5 hours that I played it, I won't play it again though as there's nothing left. Decide how much 4 hours of fun is worth to you and then compare it with this game's price and then buy it if acceptable.			"

												I only hit ""recommend"" for a specific purpose: relaxing, one night play, point-n-click. The only non-relaxing part is the searching achievements near the end. Otherwise, nope. Not a drop of recommended. The story is basic. Most of the gameplay is just trying to have the resources to do anything. The entire story is basic and requires nearly no strategy (I can only think strategy comes in if you want achievements, specifically the money one, and minimal amounts even then). The other benefit is that you can add to your ""perfect game"" total for cheap with this game. If you want a real game with real characters and interesting story? Don't bother with this one.			"

												In Hero of the Kingdom, you receive quests to go to a specific location, try to meet item requirements for that place, trade, deliver, pick up items. The game is fun but it might get repetitive quickly and there's no replay value. If you enjoy casual point & click games with a medieval story then I'd recommend buying the game when it's on discount or in a bundle.			"

												I have to say I thought it was game completely different style of game when I bought it.  It has a loose story but finding new items to gather or fight keeps this game interesting to close to the end of the game. The fights are about finding items to beat them. The game mechanic is basicly clicking to gather things while removing hearts that you need to sleep to restore.  There is a point where money may seem like you need to grind to continue. I would advise looking at the guides for getting money faster as its not very fun to grind in. The rest of the game doesn't require much grinding but its sorta like a puzzle game to find missing items to continue. The for the low price and the fact I could finish the game left me leaving at good point for the value of this game.Pros:Good valueAdventure to find new itemsCons:Not alot of strategyNot alot of story			"

												What is there to say.  I mean, the game is like a book of all things.  For a lot of the game, you're going to be dragging yourself through a rugged, boring beginning and middle until it picks up.  When it does, the game is actually very addicting.  You'll find yourself robbing raves and catching fish to sell to smugglers for hours.  While a story about a gang of bandits pillaging an area isn't interesting at first, it starts to change in fantastic ways and it even gets a little wierd.  If you like simple yet challenging point and click RPGs, Give Hero Of The Kingdom a try.  Just, wait until it's on sale.			"

												-Recommended for easy and casual entertainment If you don't have much time, if you're exhausted or bored during a meeting you can play this one. It's like a phone game.In hero of the kingdom you basically click on different icons and you get / lose some ressources. It's super-casual playing and you can't really lose. In 3 hours concentrated playing you'll be getting 100% achievements.There is some ""hidden object""-clicking and finding secrets involved, you don't have to think much but it's nice to spot a treasure and get stuff like looking for easter eggs as a kid.The game is fun to play although it doesn't satisfy any hardcore gaming needs. Graphics and gameplay are child-safe.Oh and story is fantasy standard heard 1000 times and replay value is low.			"

Will try to point some stuff about it.Pros:+Adeventure point and click genre with a RPG feeling.+Gameplay is easy but somehow addictive and kinda innovative.+Graphics and sound look right into the atmosphere.+Make you use your perception for finding hidden stuff.Cons:-Too short. Finished it 100% in less than 4 hours.-Too easy. I think the merchants should have limited supply so you can prioritize.-No replay value whatsoever.Overall Rating - 8/10. Just because it makes you want to play more of it and theres none :(.I recommend this game but you shouldnt pay more than U$5,00 on it cause you´re going to finish with it fast.Also theres a sequel comming up with already a DEMO should worth again the money.

												Overall a fun game, extremely casual with literally no challenge at all. In short: You. Cannot. Lose. Literally.^^The 3 1/2 hours I spent on it, casually going through and nearly 100% it. Last three achievements...nope, I'm not going to be staring closely at my screen to find some mushrooms and eggs around the map.Fun, but really not worth the price asked here. Impulse buy on my part; should have read reviews and seen it was so short. And I mean, really really short. If you can get it on sale for a buck or two, go for it. Otherwise, hold off. It really is something you could envision on a FTP game website.5/10 for linear gameplay, short gameplay, and lack of any kind of challenge. Still, fun overall.			"

There's a ""farmboy has to leave home, ends up saving the world"" story, you go out and explore the locations, discovering resources and actions. Each golden icon on the map is an action (like fishing), which needs some resources: tools (fishing rod), consumables (bait) and stamina. You talk to people, help them, learn new skills, all the while searching for your father, who's been taken by bandits.Three hours of casual fun to reset your brain after an honest day's work.

												Excellent little game! At first I was worried because of the way it took me by the hand during the first 5 minutes or so. But my worries dissipated after the game and quests opened up wide to allow some interesting decision-making. It was just the right level of challenge to complete all of the achievements. The story, although not very original or believable, is imersive and entertaining. I see people complaining about 2 things and I'd like to adress them. 1 - ""It's like a facebook game"". People say that because of the energy system and kind of exploration + completing quests gameplay. Yes, the gameplay is really an interactive story with exploration, hidden objects, collection and trading, so be aware. On the other hand, it does not have those annoying time limits, inviting friends and premium currency. You don't even have to wait for your energy to be low to recharge it - there's no limit to how much energy you can carry so although it's not realistic, you can rest repeatedly and build up lots of energy to then do your actions. Also, this game has an END. It does not have seasonal events and added content. So I see a monstruous gap between this game and a facebook one, I love this game and hate the ones on facebook. Huge difference.2 - ""The game is too short"". For the people who say that, I recommend a youtube video called ""in defense of short games"", from the channel Extra Credits. They explain it a lot better than I could write here. But basically if people keep on judging games only by the lenght of the gameplay, we will get longer games that provides us a poorer experience. Everybody knows at least one TV series of movie franchise that got streched to the point it became so bad it was not worth watching. We need to end this way of thinking. The lenght was perfectly fine for me. I finished the game in 2 sittings of about 3 hous each, reading every dialogue line and getting all achievements before ending the game. Isn't that enough gameplay? There are too many other games out there I'd like to experience before getting stuck with a single game that provides ""endless gameplay"" or something.If I had to complain about one thing in the game, would be the pace of the action resolution sequences. Everytime an item drops, I need to collect it before moving on. Everytime I choose to perform an action, I need to wait until it is done to do something else. I'd like to be able to do several actions at once, clicking the next one before the previous one is completed, then collect their rewards. Or at least click several actions and ""queue"" them. It would make the game more dynamic. Also, the nighttime sequence is too long for something that will be repeated several times during the game.9/10			"

http://intronerdedliving.blogspot.ca/2016/03/hero-of-kingdom-game-review-1010.htmlHero of the Kingdom - Game Review - 10/10     Hero of the Kingdom is a casual point and click indie game for $7 on Steam. For a dollar value hour value, it lasted a little over seven hours which is right where I think a game should be priced. I don't play a lot of point and click games, so I took a chance on this one and was pleasantly surprised.     This is one of my favourite types of art-styles to look at, so I thought this game was absolutely beautiful the whole way through. The music was enjoyable to listen to all throughout. The gameplay was simple and crisp. You get energy by resting, then use that energy as a resource to complete other tasks.     One of my favourite parts of this game was as it introduced new things to you through tasks, you would be able to go back through previous areas and find things such as mushrooms or boxes hidden in the scenes. It was really quite fun to look through everything and complete the achievements, read the story, and play through this sweet little game.     To anybody who enjoys a nice casual game, or a rest from their competitive games for a while, I definitely recommend this game. As usual, if you can get this on sale, it's even more worth the price.     For me, this point and click game is a 10/10.~ Kyle			"

												This isn't really a game in the strictest sense; there is little challenge and there's not a thing in the game that can't be accomplished through simple planning. Yet it is a great story and I had a good time running through it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who would rather play more action oriented games or those that focus on player agency. This game isn't about action; it is about following along with it's story. If you can get through the make-work there is a really enjoyable experience to be had here. I'd say that it falls somewhere between an interactive novel and a minimalist ""walking simulator"" style of game with some hidden object and image hunting thrown in.Not for everyone, but a pretty good time for the right kind of player. Well worth the 5.99 price tag.			"

It kills a few hours but you'll be done with it fairly quickly.  Not sure it would be worth the full asking price but if you get it in a bundle you'll have some fun with it.			"

												Overall, a fun little way to kill time, but don't expect any deep complex systems.  It's more resource management/hidden object than RPG, but overall it kept me engaged for a few hours.  It's also not a very long game, which is good, as it doesn't overstay it's welcome.  Beautiful graphics and calming music really helped keep me playing.			"

												Nice little game. Got it on sale and finished it within about 4 hours with all achievements in two sittings (and then I only stopped for food). It’s a nice, casual point and click type of adventure, with elements of hidden objects. Your task is to save the Kingdom by completing various quests, with most of these quests requiring you to find or buy certain items. You collect herbs and mushrooms. Fish and hunt and even take part in a few battles. Everything you do is fairly self-explanatory. Don’t expect epic gameplay, but for a casual game to while away a few hours this really does the job. The simplistic and casual style may not be for everyone though. The game is also a bit too short. In summary I’d say it’s a good game to get while on sale.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is like reading a book, you are guided through a story and the participation in the story line is limited to the quest. You can solve them through gathering the items needed to meet the conditions required to solve the quest. The art is beautifull and the detail is amazing, which comes in handy because you have to find very small objects sometimes. The fights are resolves in the same manner as the quests, meeting the required criteria will get you through. The game takes about 7 to 8 hours if you want to get all the achievements. A way to look up unsolved quests would be handy, but even without it, the game is perfectly playable. I enjoyed playing the game and am looking forward to the second game.			"

												For a point-n-click adventure this is a decent game. The story is slightly interesting, the graphics aren't too shabby. If you are looking for an excuse to click your mouse button for 3.5 ~ 6 hours this is the game for you! I say 3.5 ~ 6 hrs b/c it took me 3.5 to complete the game, and I did it in one sitting, but I didn't bother with trying to get every single achievement, which would probably have added a few hours of ""gameplay."" There are no puzzles or anything of the like, but you can hunt an fish an forage to your delight. There is a nifty hint button that will help you out if you skip some dialogue or can't remember where you're supposed to go, but it only applies to the main story-line. Doesn't help much with side quests. Not much replayability unless you HAVE to get every last achievement (and don't strive to get them in one play thru.) I'd give it a 5/10, not the best point and click game I've ever played, but definitly not the worst.			"

												This game was suprisingly good.  Got this game in a bundle and wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised.You take control of a young man and solve many different problems that plague the kingdom, culminating in defeating the main villian.  The story is not original, but is paced very nicely and actually plays out interestingly.  Finding all the objects and figuring out the solutions to issues is not all that difficult, but does remain interesting.  The graphics are also fairly pretty.The only cons I would have to mention are the lack of plot twists, and the relatively short play time (took me 5 hours).  While I wouldn't pay 7$ for this game, I would pay 4$ or under and still feel like I got my money's worth.			"

												There is no way on earth this game should be fun but it some how is. Basically you are just clicking things. You need an axe to chop a tree. Find an axe. The craftsman has axe but he won't sell it to you.You need 10 apples to make the craftsman like you!Click on a few apple trees.You have 10 apples.Give the apples to the craftsman.He likes you. You can now buy an axe.And so on. But somehow, this is actually any good. Maybe it's just soothing? The relentless parade of success must trigger the right brain responses.

												The gimmick is interesting, in which you simply have to find and collect items, remembering where to barter and trade goods for the best prices in order to build up a supply train that enables you to progress. But at the mid-game, once you join the army, the game starts to get repetitive, consisting of nothing more than farming and exploiting existing chains, rather than actually discovering anything new. I'd have liked to see more side-missions, the ones that aren't always marked on the map and which require hidden-object skills, or to have had more complex trading objectives that required you to make better use of the map. That said, still a fun game worth experiencing.			"

												Very good game for killing off some time. Will try to point some stuff about it.Pros:+Adeventure point and click genre with a RPG feeling.+Gameplay is easy but somehow addictive and kinda innovative.+Graphics and sound look right into the atmosphere.+Make you use your perception for finding hidden stuff.Cons:-Too short. Finished it 100% in less than 4 hours.-Too easy. I think the merchants should have limited supply so you can prioritize.-No replay value whatsoever.Overall Rating - 8/10. Just because it makes you want to play more of it and theres none :(.I recommend this game but you shouldnt pay more than U$5,00 on it cause you´re going to finish with it fast.Also theres a sequel comming up with already a DEMO should worth again the money.

												-Recommended for easy and casual entertainment If you don't have much time, if you're exhausted or bored during a meeting you can play this one. It's like a phone game.In hero of the kingdom you basically click on different icons and you get / lose some ressources. It's super-casual playing and you can't really lose. In 3 hours concentrated playing you'll be getting 100% achievements.There is some ""hidden object""-clicking and finding secrets involved, you don't have to think much but it's nice to spot a treasure and get stuff like looking for easter eggs as a kid.The game is fun to play although it doesn't satisfy any hardcore gaming needs. Graphics and gameplay are child-safe.Oh and story is fantasy standard heard 1000 times and replay value is low.			"

												I have a lot of point and click games in my library, mainly from humble bundles. However I haven't played any, so I didn't know what to expect from Hero of the Kingdom when I started it. I was surprisingly addicted. The game is short and the story is pretty generic but overall I really enjoyed it. By the game's end I had most of the acheivements and I was searching franticly for the last crates, eggs and mushrooms so I could get 100%. I did wish that it had more of an endgame rather just allowing me to finish the search for items for the acheivements, but I am glad that it did. I am looking forward the sequel that just released. Definite recommend.8/10			"

												This casual point-and-click game is difficult for me to recommend mostly in part due to the extensive annoyance of every task you perform being a fetch quest. The fact it is extremely linear with very few options in terms of how you complete a quest only exacerbates matters. Either you harvest certain supplies you need, or outright buy them. I expect a certain simplicity with casual games like this, but this seemed to be a bit much in that regard. The story is very minimalistic with writing on par with a young children's story--just enough to make a point. It has very pleasing visuals and sound and the game length felt just about right from a completionist viewpoint.That said, this is a game that would be delightful to play with children. The simple story, hidden-object elements, and resource management just feel like it targets more of a family video-game night and I am reminded of old adventure classics like Mixed Up Mother Goose I would play with my parents and friends when I was young.Other players looking for a light, relaxing gaming experience can just sit down and enjoy the story without any pressures or puzzling to do however, players wanting a game that provides a more thoughtful experience may end up disappointed.

												One of the calmest, most relaxing games I've ever played. After playing for what felt like 10 minutes, an hour and a half had passed. It's not your typical point-and-click, it's more like a FarmVille-style resource management game. However it removes all the stress and uncertainty associated with in-app purchases, as there aren't any! The story and graphics follow like an Age of Empires 2 spin-off, and that's no bad thing. There are also elements of 'Where's Wally' where you try and find things amongst the beautifully rendered landscape, and the game never tries to trip you up or be unfair. The constant rewards give you a real sense of accomplishment as you play. I'm two hours in and I don't expect there to be much more on offer, but I'm more than satisfied with what the game is trying to do. Loved it :)			"

												Short, simple, and fun enough while it lasts.  This is a very casual and relaxing game, albeit a repetitive one.  I got it for less than two dollars on sale, and to be honest, I wouldn't pay more than that.  There are a couple mechanics the game never properly explains to you, such as finding eggs, mushrooms, crates, and the like.  (You have to click on the tiny little pictures you see on the map; they don't have icons like almost everything else.)  On top of that, a game this simple could have benefited from a marginally more unique story.  I'm not saying you have to construct an epic tale, or anything, but man, you could have attempted SOME sort of a unique plot twist.  I mean, I guess there was one, kind of, but it was the sort of thing you've probably seen a million times before.One of my biggest problems in this game was how hard it is to make money.  One of the hints I was given at some point consisted of doing tasks for people, which would have been all well and good, if it weren't for the fact that pretty much every single task required some sort of payment up front.  Occasionally, you'll get a somewhat sizable-seeming sum, but since everything is so expensive, it'll probably be gone very quickly.  Eventually, I ended up trying to gather and sell all the herbs and fish I could, but none of that stuff ever respawns, as it turns out; once you gather all the herbs and fish at all the fishing spots, it's gone forever.  So if you need that stuff later, as I did, you'll be buying them from the store.When I say I recommend this game, bear in mind that I only recommend it if you can get it for two bucks or less.  This is one of those ""I have less than five bucks left in my Steam wallet, what do I do with it?"" sort of game, not the kind of thing you should go out of your way to buy.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom isn't your daily dose of adrenaline. It's a point-and-click adventure, focused in the story and with many characters, items and places.It's a calm paced game with visuals that reminds you of Age of Empires.The story of the game is something that you might have read for a couple of times.There are different side-quests and ways to grow your character. By finishing them you'll be getting achievements and mostly items that will help you to reach the end of the story easily, and of course the feeling that you're getting deeper in the world around you.The music and the sounds effects are enjoyable in a world where few things move and the images dissapear and reapear in order to show the progress of the tale.It took me less than 3 hours to make all the side-quests and finish the game, with a couple of gathering achivements to do.It was nice to play it, but it's nothing that you haven't played for sure.

												Short (-ish), very addictive game about adventuring, helping people and doing stuff. Most of the interaction is poin'n'click and reading. Nevertheless, very fun to play. I've completed the main quest in roughly 3hrs, so it is really short (but what you expect...). And the whole plot is very linear. But still, the mood, the graphics are nice and it is really pleasant to play :)TL;DRWorth the money.			"

												I'd originally kind of dismissed this game due to the Casual tag and the simplicity of it, but I liked it once I gave it a try. For anyone on the fence about it, just give the demo a try. My only complaints were: 1. The handholding going on in the beginning and a lack of freedom that went with that. 2. Once you open things up it's hard to keep track of what all you're doing. There's no journal or anything like that. 3. The hint option is what is offered to make up for that. You're essentially offered a Cheat at Any Time button and it's the only way of reminding yourself, for instance, where to go on the map to find the one merchant you need for an objectiveIt's a simple game and lacks features found in bigger offerings, but that does not take away from it being good at what it does have. So, again, try the demo to see if it's something you'd be into or not.			"

												This game surprised me. It was extremely relaxing. This is one of those games where you can lay in bed and play with just the mouse. Sure it's a point and click story bookish game, but combined with the cute but immersive graphics, sound effects, music, and dialogue, it successfully pulls the player into its world. Sure the plot was quite predictable but it was quite satisfying as a result. The art was beautifully done, emulating more classical 8-16 bit graphics. I beat the game in two days, however on the second day I couldn't wait to finish school to rush home and continue the story, I just couldn't put this title down until it was finished. It also had quite a unique battle system, if you can call it that... For what this game is, 9/10 from me.Cons:-No replay-ability.-The end game was a tiny bit monotonous but it's a small inconvenience.-Easter egg hunting tiny objects for side-quests is annoying.-Lots of back tracking... and memorization...

												It is a cute, short and simplistic game in which all you do is click around the screen to further the story.The game is akin to a hidden object game, however it is less focused on that and more focused on completing quests which are always completed by simply having the required item on hand, and you can always buy or easily find those items around.You can not lose in this game, you could possibly get stuck in it if you really wanted to by wasting all of your money on things you don't need, but realistically all you need to complete this game is enough patience for a few hours of clicking around the screen and that's it, you will finish it in 2 hours and a half and you will complete most of the quests doing so. You will then have a few hidden collectibles to find but that's about it, and I would say the game has next to zero replay value.I recommend it to anyone who enjoys hidden object games and possibly to someone who just wants to play something relaxed.6 / 10			"

												This is like an RPG, but without combat or any real failure states. It's more a point-and-click adventure/hidden object game than anything else, I suppose. Kind of simple and not particularly long but it's surprisingly engaging. Could be the inherent lack of challenge involved. There's nothing to make you want to stop playigng, so you keep on playing. Probably a decent game to get from a bundle but not one I'd recommend at full price. Also, pixel hunting can be kind of a chore.			"

What I Liked- The gameplay was an interesting blend of Point-and-Click RPG and Hidden Object genres.  I had a great time with both aspects, though I'd be hard-pressed to choose which I liked more!- I really enjoyed playing Hero of the Kingdom.  I hear there is a sequel on the way, and looking forward to playing it!What I Disliked- This game was pretty short.  Expect to put in 4-6 hours, depending on how quickly you can read and whether or not you get all of the Steam achivements.- There were a misspelled word or two in the dialog, and a small handful of grammatical errors (English language).

												This game is awesome, and not just because it was made by my counrtymen :)It's not exactly an RPG, it's more like a point-and-click adventure with RPG elements and HOG elements. There's a ""farmboy has to leave home, ends up saving the world"" story, you go out and explore the locations, discovering resources and actions. Each golden icon on the map is an action (like fishing), which needs some resources: tools (fishing rod), consumables (bait) and stamina. You talk to people, help them, learn new skills, all the while searching for your father, who's been taken by bandits.Three hours of casual fun to reset your brain after an honest day's work. Go for it, you'll come back for a replay.			"

												This is a very casual rpg game using point and click interactions. There are some side quests in the game, and a simple plotline that's easy to follow. I honestly didn't expect much when I started playing, but the game was surprisingly easy to immerse yourself into. The game itself calls for some degree of knowing how to utilize your current resources, and planning out how to gain future resources. And the constant to and fro barter system, along with seeking out resources along the map, might seem a tad tedious to some people. But, all in all, I would say that this is the game for someone looking for some relaxing and fun gaming.			"

												I find this game relaxing yet adictive.you can't go wrong for the price of french fries.Try the demo, if you like it, <$2 is well worth it, unless you are looking for fast paced combat!Basically it is a resorce management game within a common, good vs evil story.It may seem as if you can go where you want, when you want, but eventually, you are guided from A to B to C etc.There is a bit of hidden object to it where you try to find very minute things hidden in the landscape, which can give you a lot of inventory. speaking of which, the hardest part is remembering who buys and sell what. although getting around is easy, your quests require certain items to accomplish (including rest). vendors and quest points are well labeled, but where did they sell that tool I just broke? you are never seen nor have to walk across the screen, just click on the place with an icon and you are there, or the map system will instantly transport you across the world.the trick is keeping your funds up by using tools to aquire items that are hopefully worth more than the tools, and knowing where to use or sell them. 'So, try then buy it, (on sale) you can't help but become the hero.			"

												$2 for a few hours of entertainment well spent. I would have spent the money again in a second.This game is not intended for someone looking for a heavy challenge. I enjoy looking for the hidden treasures and items to collect your achievements. The game also has a fun storyline to follow. Not at any point do you have to worry about dying its more remembering where to get certain items to complete miniquests. I love how some call themselves hardcore gamers and won't play a game like this. In my opinion if you are hardcore you will play any game as long as it is fun. If you only play one style of game then that only means you have no mind to go outside of the trends. I love FPS, Survival Horror, Puzzle, Hidden Object, and many other styles. This was well worth the money spent for a good fun casual time. Great job devs, I want more! =D			"

												For a fiver this provides a decent game.  It's a kind of puzzle/hidden object mix set out like an RPG.  You travel from area to area, accomplishing set objectives in order to progress through the story.  Often it's as simple as gather x number of this object, and then returning to the quest setter.  There is some grinding necessary but that's the case with many games.Getting all of the 38 achievements isn't too hard either.  However, this does require a real eagle eye for spotting the tiny objects on screen.  On my 1980 x 1080 setting monitor, I had to painstakingly search each map area carefully to find the objects, which can be tiny.Overall, not a bad game for the price.  (I got it in a sale but can't remember the sale price.)   A little dull compared to my usual games, but I felt I got value for money.  Playing it in small(ish) chunks may help break up any monotony.Would I play it again?  Not sure.  I doubt it.  But then again, I can blow £5 in a few minutes at the amusement arcades, and at least I could return to this for free if I wanted.			"

So that keep you busy.-Archivements huntingCoints. No replay game play its when you done everything there is nothing to do.So 1 solo good game and your done.

												The gimmick is interesting, in which you simply have to find and collect items, remembering where to barter and trade goods for the best prices in order to build up a supply train that enables you to progress. But at the mid-game, once you join the army, the game starts to get repetitive, consisting of nothing more than farming and exploiting existing chains, rather than actually discovering anything new. I'd have liked to see more side-missions, the ones that aren't always marked on the map and which require hidden-object skills, or to have had more complex trading objectives that required you to make better use of the map. That said, still a fun game worth experiencing.			"

												Recommended... If you like this kind of game. So what exactly is it? I'd describe it as a short, linear story driven resource collection game with a bit of hidden object along the way. Pretty much a top down point and click adventure.Despite the looks, it is definitely not:A city building gameA strategy gameAn RPG (in the skyrim/mass effecty sense of the word)The story is cliched as can be, the artwork fairly pleasant, the difficulty not to challenging. It's a very laid back game, that is enjoyable because you feel like you're constantly progressing, and everything fits together tightly. The worst part of it was a mid-game lack of money, but I had missed that hunting trophies and fish are mainly for selling (and only occasionally for quests). I completed everything (absolutely) in 4 hours, so this is only a short diversion. If you want a short point and click adventure from a different perspective, this is a fair option.			"

												This casual point-and-click game is difficult for me to recommend mostly in part due to the extensive annoyance of every task you perform being a fetch quest. The fact it is extremely linear with very few options in terms of how you complete a quest only exacerbates matters. Either you harvest certain supplies you need, or outright buy them. I expect a certain simplicity with casual games like this, but this seemed to be a bit much in that regard. The story is very minimalistic with writing on par with a young children's story--just enough to make a point. It has very pleasing visuals and sound and the game length felt just about right from a completionist viewpoint.That said, this is a game that would be delightful to play with children. The simple story, hidden-object elements, and resource management just feel like it targets more of a family video-game night and I am reminded of old adventure classics like Mixed Up Mother Goose I would play with my parents and friends when I was young.Other players looking for a light, relaxing gaming experience can just sit down and enjoy the story without any pressures or puzzling to do however, players wanting a game that provides a more thoughtful experience may end up disappointed.

												Small and nice game if point and click games is your thing.The mood is nice, and the gameplay is kind of catchy because you want to optimize your gathering of resources. And that's basically what you do: Gather resources. You go picking some mushrooms, hunting some animals, getting stuff for people, trading and so on. There's really not much you can do wrong so the gameplay is much about how to optimize your resources. Even combat is a question about having the right resources (e.g. 2 bowmen and 4 healing potions). So if you have the resources you can fight (and win) and if you haven't got the resources you can't attack until you've got them. It's pretty simple and that's actually some of the appeal of this game.I'm not a power player but I like to hunt for achievements.It took me 3,5 hours to complete the game with all the achievements. So it's not a big game. But it was definitely enjoyable.			"

												Saving the kingdom has never been so... relaxing.Hero of the Kingdom is a very straightforward point-and-click/hidden object game that is cheerfully content with what it is. Each task is simply given a set of resources necessary to complete it, and if you have those resources, you can clear the task. After all, of course the hero of the story makes it through, why pretend otherwise? The hidden objects on each map can usually be converted directly into money, or used to clear various unlock tasks, which are used to gain access to various resources you need.You do end up feeling less than of a hero, and more of a military quartermaster, sourcing local materials and labor to win the campaign against the Dark Lord. But this is what makes the game so relaxing. No timing, no complicated clicking, just knowing where to get the parts you need to assemble your victory. It rewards remembering who sells what, and being able to find eggs in a forest map, rather than actions per second. Even the achievements are hardly difficult (though I really had to search for that last bird's nest).Everything about the game is very polished, as well. The soundtrack fits, the maps progress cleanly from one to the other, and you can always get the resources you need if you're willing to go kill and skin a few wild animals. Even if you sell something you need later in the game to get the money for an immediate goal, there's always someone who will sell it right back to you, usually for the same price you got in the first place.This is a good game to spend a few hours relaxing with.

It's just a short and simple click-around game, but it somehow presses you to go on. It's easy to complete and get all the achievements. It's a nice way to idle away an afternoon or evening.			"

												I have not played a point and click adventure this good for a long long time. It has good graphics, good soundtrack, good gameplay and a good storyline. Yes, it is a bit short, however it's the journey that counts and with it being on sale for $1.74 USD at the moment, it's well worth the price for the amount of time you'll get out of it. If you don't mind backtracking and using your eyes to spot minature differences, then you'll really enjoy this game. If you're not a fan of the medieval fantasy genre and you are annoyed by those two previous things I mentioned, then this game probably won't be for you. For others like myself who enjoy this sort of thing: Grab it and have a blast.			"

												Great game if you need a break from challenging FPS or grueling strategy. Hero of the Kingdom has a very linear story; You play as the only child of a farmer who goes to town, leaving you to look after the farm. You go about performing various tasks and learning the basics of the game. There is no real challange to the game, you cannot die, but you require sleep in order to perform tasks, and some tasks are more tedious than others.As you progress you'll discover skills, these skills allow you to find things that are scattered throughout each of the areas. Maxing the skills allows you to complete a moderate amount of the challanges presented and also allow you to complete the game quicker.This is an easy 100%  achievment get. Though it is can take up a lot of time as some of the objects are cleverly hidden.At the end of the day I would definitly recomend this game to those looking to take a break from the norm, particularly at a sale price.

												Recommended... If you like this kind of game. So what exactly is it? I'd describe it as a short, linear story driven resource collection game with a bit of hidden object along the way. Pretty much a top down point and click adventure.Despite the looks, it is definitely not:A city building gameA strategy gameAn RPG (in the skyrim/mass effecty sense of the word)The story is cliched as can be, the artwork fairly pleasant, the difficulty not to challenging. It's a very laid back game, that is enjoyable because you feel like you're constantly progressing, and everything fits together tightly. The worst part of it was a mid-game lack of money, but I had missed that hunting trophies and fish are mainly for selling (and only occasionally for quests). I completed everything (absolutely) in 4 hours, so this is only a short diversion. If you want a short point and click adventure from a different perspective, this is a fair option.			"

												The First one there was no review option back on steam back then. So i was playing the next version 2.Very fun to play its story driven so keep that in mind. No (real action) its a point to click (or search and click) game. Pros.-Graphics its fun not to wild not to fancy-Sound/music its pleasent to lissen to it-4 hours long to get all the object. So that keep you busy.-Archivements huntingCoints. No replay game play its when you done everything there is nothing to do.So 1 solo good game and your done. Thats allI recommend to play this first before jumping to serie 2 its a contineu you will however not miss allot but its still a fresh start.			"

												The gimmick is interesting, in which you simply have to find and collect items, remembering where to barter and trade goods for the best prices in order to build up a supply train that enables you to progress. But at the mid-game, once you join the army, the game starts to get repetitive, consisting of nothing more than farming and exploiting existing chains, rather than actually discovering anything new. I'd have liked to see more side-missions, the ones that aren't always marked on the map and which require hidden-object skills, or to have had more complex trading objectives that required you to make better use of the map. That said, still a fun game worth experiencing.			"

												So this was a quirky little game I've had my eyes on for a while. Having picked it up on offer, I decided to give it a run-through, and it was a generally pleasant experience. Nothing that stands out in particular in terms of what would set it apart from other games, but nothing that felt like it hampered my experiences either. If you have a few hours to spare and a bit of change, this is worth at least one playthrough to pass the time away. It doesn't have much of worth to bring you back for a second playthrough, but given a reasonable price point and it's worth the one time.The game is essentially a resource management simulation where you have to manage what you have, your energy, money and your skills to eventually become the ""Hero of the Kingdom"", and honestly, it's not too challenging provided that methodical progression is applied to everything, from levelling your capabilities to ensuring you have enough food or money for the next event you have to overcome. It does have some strategical layer of depth to it (case in point, you can simply buy certain things you need, but if you work on your skills you can get items for much cheaper than you would buying them) and I appreciated the layers that had been taken to reward those who did go a little extra in managing their resources more efficientlyA lot of the gameplay elements are easily visible event points, though one of the other draws of the game is an element of hidden object games, where you find items such as mushrooms or crates for extra items and money. Beyond these elements, it tends to play forward in a more point-and-click adventure game than your typical RPG (a great number of RPG elements are not present here, so if you are looking for an RPG experience, I would advise seeking this elsewhere) and the story it does tell through the story is a simple one, with a neat bow finish after the ending progresses. If any complaint could be thought of, it would be that there's no real sense of time passing by as any of these events transpire - and given that you can rest in camps without any effect to the story does not help in this regard.In terms of the art assets, the landscapes, the various icons and the people you get to see are pleasant to look at, with nothing looking out of the ordinary for a fantasy adventure. The game has a good sound quality to it, from the effects to the music, though it can sometimes be distracting when the track suddenly changes while you've been on a screen for a while without any change. All-in-all, though, the complaints that I have are minor and nit-picky, and did not detract from the fact that I did get enjoyment from the game overall, and while I clocked only about 4-5 hours and obtained all achievements (with others completing it in less time), it was a worthwhile 4-5 hours that I had spent without any regrets.In summary: While a short point-and-click adventure experience, it's hidden object and resource management elements helped keep the gameplay varied and entertaining, while the story and progression was balanced enough that it did not feel like it carried on for too long or too short a time, and it didn't leave any loose ends. It's lack of difficulty or replay value is an appeal for anyone seeking something to plug into for a few hours of their time, and the price value makes this at least worth a purchase on a sale, if not at full price.

												I have owned this game for awhile but the other day I decided to start playing it out of boredom. I can honestly say this scratched the itch that I was feeling. It feels like a cross between a point and click adventure with some RPG-like elements and one of those hidden object games thrown in for fun. It's not overly complicated but has a lot to collect and do in a short amount of time. I managed to complete the game, and all 38 Steam achievements in about 4 hours. A good tip: When you start hunting bears you need poison. The first way to get it is to buy it from a shady guy, but don't buy it from him. Instead advance the story a little further till you unlock someone who will craft it for you for free.			"

												Hero of the Kingdom is a very satisfying game...unless of course you can't find that last mushroom :P. All jokes aside, this game is an inexpensive, short game that was quite enjoyable. For a game that only requires about 2 hours to complete the main story, the point-and-click experience was worth every penny (of which there are not many required). For the completionist, many of the achievements require entire completion of finding one item in the game's world, and are quite satifying to get in the short time it takes. If you have a free afternoon and a few spare bucks, I would completely recommend Hero of the Kingdom to every gamer out there that wants a little bundle of fun.			"

												If you are not interested in click point games, I do not recommend this game.Nevertheless, if you are interested in click point games, I should say while you are playing you do not notice what time is.Nevertheless, in the beginning you can be bored because of some ordinary things belonging to click point games.That is to say, from the middle of the game, the game will draw you in until you end game after 3-5 hours.The good thing is that the side quests and characters are enough to break cliche air of the game, yet main quests and events or at least the final quests makes you question worthiness of the game.However, the midst of the game are enough for playing a cheap game and to kill some time.

												I have to say I thought it was game completely different style of game when I bought it.  It has a loose story but finding new items to gather or fight keeps this game interesting to close to the end of the game. The fights are about finding items to beat them. The game mechanic is basicly clicking to gather things while removing hearts that you need to sleep to restore.  There is a point where money may seem like you need to grind to continue. I would advise looking at the guides for getting money faster as its not very fun to grind in. The rest of the game doesn't require much grinding but its sorta like a puzzle game to find missing items to continue. The for the low price and the fact I could finish the game left me leaving at good point for the value of this game.Pros:Good valueAdventure to find new itemsCons:Not alot of strategyNot alot of story			"

Finished it 100% in less than 4 hours.-Too easy. I think the merchants should have limited supply so you can prioritize.-No replay value whatsoever.Overall Rating - 8/10. Just because it makes you want to play more of it and theres none :(.I recommend this game but you shouldnt pay more than U$5,00 on it cause you´re going to finish with it fast.Also theres a sequel comming up with already a DEMO should worth again the money.

												What is there to say.  I mean, the game is like a book of all things.  For a lot of the game, you're going to be dragging yourself through a rugged, boring beginning and middle until it picks up.  When it does, the game is actually very addicting.  You'll find yourself robbing raves and catching fish to sell to smugglers for hours.  While a story about a gang of bandits pillaging an area isn't interesting at first, it starts to change in fantastic ways and it even gets a little wierd.  If you like simple yet challenging point and click RPGs, Give Hero Of The Kingdom a try.  Just, wait until it's on sale.			"

												For me, as well as many other reviewers (so it seems) this game was a nice unexpected pleasent surprise.I actually went into game expecting a completely different genre - I thaught it would be a casual town building/management game, what it actually was is nice blend of P&C adventure with nice gamey RPG elements and statistics, and some hidden object elements.While playing it on a small(ish) laptop screen (1366x768) the graphics were nice crisp 2D painting-like pictures reminescent of those detailed, colorful and clear-lined screens of games like Desperados, Commandos, Settlers and in modern times Anno series. This one though is fully in 2d, which I personally like a lot, cause it still manages to deliver more slick, more detailed and thin-lined drawings, opposed to 3d muddying of features caused by texture requirements and antialiasing. I'd argue that 3d engines still aren't capable of producing such fine lines as simple and clear as 2d drawing/sprite and this game uses that fact to the full effect. The visual presentation is, again, clear, colorful and full of small details. So far I'd played for some 2 or 3 hours (ignore the Steam stats, I don't understand why it didn't record the last session) in one sitting and the experience was delightful, the flow of quests and tasks slick and satisfying and gameplay varied enough to still feel interesting, though in the beginning you solely click on few points on screen and manage few basic stats like food and building materials. Slowly you get involved with you character, though his actions aren't described in much verbouse prose, but later when he manageas to learn few skills and has some successful quests uder his belt you do start to care and do notice when he starts calling some officer HIS captain, since he recently enlisted in land's military. The progres from a naive farmboy to adventurer to ultimate hero is a familiar tale, but it's nicely done and somewhat beliveably depicted - in slow careful stages. In this case journey is more satisfying than the end and slow exploring of map, solving quests and ""leveling up"" (though the only stat connected to that is reputation) makes a nice calm romp. So my overal oppinion is that it's competent and surprizingly fun casual P&C adventure. It has earned my recommendation fair and square, the same way as the annonymous hero will earn to be the Hero of his Kingdom.			"

												Short, simple, and fun enough while it lasts.  This is a very casual and relaxing game, albeit a repetitive one.  I got it for less than two dollars on sale, and to be honest, I wouldn't pay more than that.  There are a couple mechanics the game never properly explains to you, such as finding eggs, mushrooms, crates, and the like.  (You have to click on the tiny little pictures you see on the map; they don't have icons like almost everything else.)  On top of that, a game this simple could have benefited from a marginally more unique story.  I'm not saying you have to construct an epic tale, or anything, but man, you could have attempted SOME sort of a unique plot twist.  I mean, I guess there was one, kind of, but it was the sort of thing you've probably seen a million times before.One of my biggest problems in this game was how hard it is to make money.  One of the hints I was given at some point consisted of doing tasks for people, which would have been all well and good, if it weren't for the fact that pretty much every single task required some sort of payment up front.  Occasionally, you'll get a somewhat sizable-seeming sum, but since everything is so expensive, it'll probably be gone very quickly.  Eventually, I ended up trying to gather and sell all the herbs and fish I could, but none of that stuff ever respawns, as it turns out; once you gather all the herbs and fish at all the fishing spots, it's gone forever.  So if you need that stuff later, as I did, you'll be buying them from the store.When I say I recommend this game, bear in mind that I only recommend it if you can get it for two bucks or less.  This is one of those ""I have less than five bucks left in my Steam wallet, what do I do with it?"" sort of game, not the kind of thing you should go out of your way to buy.			"

												Small and nice game if point and click games is your thing.The mood is nice, and the gameplay is kind of catchy because you want to optimize your gathering of resources. And that's basically what you do: Gather resources. You go picking some mushrooms, hunting some animals, getting stuff for people, trading and so on. There's really not much you can do wrong so the gameplay is much about how to optimize your resources. Even combat is a question about having the right resources (e.g. 2 bowmen and 4 healing potions). So if you have the resources you can fight (and win) and if you haven't got the resources you can't attack until you've got them. It's pretty simple and that's actually some of the appeal of this game.I'm not a power player but I like to hunt for achievements.It took me 3,5 hours to complete the game with all the achievements. So it's not a big game. But it was definitely enjoyable.			"

												Saving the kingdom has never been so... relaxing.Hero of the Kingdom is a very straightforward point-and-click/hidden object game that is cheerfully content with what it is. Each task is simply given a set of resources necessary to complete it, and if you have those resources, you can clear the task. After all, of course the hero of the story makes it through, why pretend otherwise? The hidden objects on each map can usually be converted directly into money, or used to clear various unlock tasks, which are used to gain access to various resources you need.You do end up feeling less than of a hero, and more of a military quartermaster, sourcing local materials and labor to win the campaign against the Dark Lord. But this is what makes the game so relaxing. No timing, no complicated clicking, just knowing where to get the parts you need to assemble your victory. It rewards remembering who sells what, and being able to find eggs in a forest map, rather than actions per second. Even the achievements are hardly difficult (though I really had to search for that last bird's nest).Everything about the game is very polished, as well. The soundtrack fits, the maps progress cleanly from one to the other, and you can always get the resources you need if you're willing to go kill and skin a few wild animals. Even if you sell something you need later in the game to get the money for an immediate goal, there's always someone who will sell it right back to you, usually for the same price you got in the first place.This is a good game to spend a few hours relaxing with.

												This game surprised me. It was extremely relaxing. This is one of those games where you can lay in bed and play with just the mouse. Sure it's a point and click story bookish game, but combined with the cute but immersive graphics, sound effects, music, and dialogue, it successfully pulls the player into its world. Sure the plot was quite predictable but it was quite satisfying as a result. The art was beautifully done, emulating more classical 8-16 bit graphics. I beat the game in two days, however on the second day I couldn't wait to finish school to rush home and continue the story, I just couldn't put this title down until it was finished. It also had quite a unique battle system, if you can call it that... For what this game is, 9/10 from me.Cons:-No replay-ability.-The end game was a tiny bit monotonous but it's a small inconvenience.-Easter egg hunting tiny objects for side-quests is annoying.-Lots of back tracking... and memorization...

Still it is an enjoyable game with a somewhat predictable storyline. And you can't really go wrong in this game. I finished it in one sitting, guess that says how much I enjoyed it. :)			"

												Very good casual game. Sort of adventure/rpg/hidden items like game. The game expands all the time and gives you new skills to try out and items to look for. It's quite addictive - it has the 'just one more quest/turn before I quit'.Recommended!			"

												This game is a fun little time waster that can be played casually in about 3 hours. Add in the searching for items and collection you probably get another hourish or so out of it. The story is pretty cut and paste but enjoyable for the way the game plays. Collecting the achievements towards the end, the mushrooms in particular, was difficult because of their lack of distinction from the map pallet colors. Still a fun short game. Sadly not replayable.			"

What I Liked- The gameplay was an interesting blend of Point-and-Click RPG and Hidden Object genres.  I had a great time with both aspects, though I'd be hard-pressed to choose which I liked more!- I really enjoyed playing Hero of the Kingdom.  I hear there is a sequel on the way, and looking forward to playing it!What I Disliked- This game was pretty short.  Expect to put in 4-6 hours, depending on how quickly you can read and whether or not you get all of the Steam achivements.- There were a misspelled word or two in the dialog, and a small handful of grammatical errors (English language).

												This game was suprisingly good.  Got this game in a bundle and wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised.You take control of a young man and solve many different problems that plague the kingdom, culminating in defeating the main villian.  The story is not original, but is paced very nicely and actually plays out interestingly.  Finding all the objects and figuring out the solutions to issues is not all that difficult, but does remain interesting.  The graphics are also fairly pretty.The only cons I would have to mention are the lack of plot twists, and the relatively short play time (took me 5 hours).  While I wouldn't pay 7$ for this game, I would pay 4$ or under and still feel like I got my money's worth.			"

												tl;dr: Bake Bread Simulator: The Facebook Hidden-Object game.11/10, strangely addictive and rewarding. Pretty graphics and music, too.However, It's a 'bundle game', if you get my drift. Probably not worth buying full price unless this is your jam.100% completed in under 5 hours, so I'm sure it's not really worth more than 6 hours, if you took your time.The whole experience felt like a hearty meal; It didn't blow my mind, but it didn't let me down at any point either.The story and side 'quests' were thick enough to get immersed into, but thin enough to keep the flow of the game going.Solid progression kept me interested without giving it all to me too quickly.I spent 20 minutes looking for the last damn crate. My attention-span is atrocious.Take from this what you will.			"

												Not a bad game.  It's nothing overly exciting, but it's a nice little casual game.My one complaint is the sheer number of tasks you're given at one time.  It can get too much, and many times I simply started at the beginning of the map & walked through each area checking off tasks.  It wouldn't be so bad if it had a task list.Overall though, it's a good casual game.			"

												I honestly don't know why I enjoyed this game so much, but I did.  It is a very simple point and click game with little challenge.  What difficulty there is comes from finding small items hidden on the map.  This game isn't very replayable as every experience will be about the same.  Overall a nice way to take a break and relax when you get frustrated by some other, more difficult game.  Despite being so easy the acheivements really feel like accomplishments.			"

												Neat little game. It's kind of a Point and click adventure game, and a little bit of a hidden objects game. I wouldnt call it a good game but its not bad. If you can get it cheap it can be a nice little time waster.Edit: I 100% this 38/38 achievments in 4.5 hous. The actual game is shorter but It does not take long to do everything possible in the game.I would still recomend it if you see it in a bundle. Or if you find it on sale for like a buck it can pass some time. I didnt hate it.			"

												If you're looking for a Neverwinter Nights or Baldur's Gate style RPG, this isn't it.  It's not even an Avadon or Avernum. It's like a pre-school for a major RPG to lead casual gamers into the real thing - and it does it really well. It takes the hidden object game and the text based RPG and gently rolls them into one with a series of background locations which are gradually revealed as the story progresses. The story's not very original but is well told, and none of the tasks is too irksome. For the price, it's worth a few hours of your time, which is all it will take. "

												Very good casual game. It's fairly easy to finish, even with 100% achievements. The game combines point-and-click adventure with Where's Waldo to create an easy going experience, where you can spend as much time as you want to finish the quest. There is a downside: once you've found everything there is to find (resulting in 100% achievement) the game is completely over and doesn't renew any of the fishing, hunting or shrooming quests. All in all a good, relatively short game to buy in a sale.			"

												What an awesome game. It was refreshing to have a game where the combat was just a click and not hammering a million buttons. It was short but fantastic while it lasted. It took me a few minutes to warm up to it but I am really sad it's over now.The main quest line linear but you can wander off to do the side quests when you feel like it. You will have to at some stages to build the coffers up. One of my favourite point and click games. The tip section was fantastic working out how much gold I needed to complete each quest. Great for the lazy! Made it a lot easier to go and make the gold instead of continuously having to go back and check with the quest giver. The graphics are beautiful. The only thing I didn't like were the constant repeating ambient sounds in each section. Apart from that 5 stars!			"

												I really enjoyed this game.  It has a simple interface and a mellow, engrossing storyline.  You can just do things at your own pace, in your own time.  There is a general linearity, but you get quite a bit of leeway in when you do what.  I would only say that you can and should click LOTS of things on the map.  There is this gatherer element, but it didn’t feel like much of a grind.  Also, you can finish the achievements after you have finished the story, in case you are into that sort of thing.  All in all, a great little game with a different approach to fantasy RPG ... 10/10.			"

Not a drop of recommended. The story is basic. Most of the gameplay is just trying to have the resources to do anything. The entire story is basic and requires nearly no strategy (I can only think strategy comes in if you want achievements, specifically the money one, and minimal amounts even then). The other benefit is that you can add to your ""perfect game"" total for cheap with this game. If you want a real game with real characters and interesting story? Don't bother with this one.			"

I am about to go look for a sequel or something similar.Update: Theres a Sequel. I will be getting it.			"

												I can't really explain it, the story is not that engaging, it's alot of back tracking, and the only thing you do is click your left  mouse button. Yet, I sat 5h straight until I beat it. The graphics are charming and for some reason I find fun to click to fish, hunt, saw, fight etc. The ""hidden objects"" such as eggs, mushrooms, chests etc. makes you really pay attention to every screen which is nice because the areas are nice made and high attention to detail.

												Now, I got this as one game in a $3.00 bundle of ten games. Most of them, as you would expect, aren't that great. This one, however, really surprised me with its comparative depth and quality. It's only taken me 4 hours to beat the game, and I don't see myself re-playing it anytime soon, but it was certainly a ride while it lasted.Very good. Maybe not worth $6.00, but so few of the games on Steam are actually worth their base cost.			"

												I only hit ""recommend"" for a specific purpose: relaxing, one night play, point-n-click. The only non-relaxing part is the searching achievements near the end. Otherwise, nope. Not a drop of recommended. The story is basic. Most of the gameplay is just trying to have the resources to do anything. The entire story is basic and requires nearly no strategy (I can only think strategy comes in if you want achievements, specifically the money one, and minimal amounts even then). The other benefit is that you can add to your ""perfect game"" total for cheap with this game. If you want a real game with real characters and interesting story? Don't bother with this one.			"

												Good game with consistant story and clue. There is no difficulty in the game play.The only part you should pay attention is those eggs , craves and mushroom on the map. Those are required for the the achievement. The game is pretty easy to handle with mouse click and you sit down and take a break while playing this game. The music is not bad and relaxing during most partof the game. The overall grade for the game is 9/10 for people looking for a casual game.			"

												I picked this game up without proper research and only judging it from the screenshots I saw. Surprisingly it was not the kind of game I expected but regardless turned out to be quite an enjoyable experience. The only sad part is that I didn't manage to get 100% of the 'collectables' in one playthrough so I have to play through it again to get it. That in itself is not so much a problem because it's still fun, but it doesn't offer any replay value in terms of experiencing a different adventure the 2nd time through.Basically, it's a point & click adventure in the literal sense that you will have to click.. a lot. The game is set up in a way that you could never fail it unless maybe you were deliberately trying to - and even then I question the possibility. For that matter it can be said that the game is somewhat of the easy nature. Really, the only real challenge in this game is getting 100% of the achievements / completion. The story is pretty straightforward and not really memorable but there are a lot of hidden 'secrets' and things to look out for which makes this a great game for those who are into exploration or putting their eyes and mind to the test.

												This was a decent point-and-click adventure. Graphics and music are very nice, writing is competent enough, puzzles are straightforward but not completely trivial. The plotline is utterly predictable, but the gameplay isn't excessively linear and some of the characters are cute (like the frogmen). It also lets you continue playing after you finish, so you can get all the achievements.Not a lot of replay value, and there's a certain amount of hunt-the-pixel involved in some of the puzzles and achievements, but overall a solid 5 hours' entertainment.

												Calling it an RPG is overly generous, I think, false advertising even.  There are no customization options, and the story can't be affected by anything you do.  It's a resource management game like Kingdom Tales, or 12 Labours of Hercules.  It's a great one, though.  It's mindlessly simple.  A click-happy game.  I loved it.  Not too short.  Not boring (if you like these kinds of games, that is).  I bought/played the original, and sequel, and they're equally great.  Well worth the full purchase price.			"

												Conclusion: This game isn't worth the 6 bucks they currently demand for it. I'd say it's well worth about 3 since you will enjoy it for 3 hours, if it's your cup of tea that is.Since the conclusion is what y'all look for I simply put it on the top. If you wanna keep reading then proceed to further thoughts. If you want a challenge, look elsewhere. This game is more of an interactive storytelling and it's a good one. The story isn't anything new, just a from boy to man kindoff thing going on. It's also just a point and clicker game, if you want to pick up mushrooms, click em and you got em.So you will not do anything strategybased, the game really walks you through the whole thing without room for failure.All this might sound like it's just plain crap, that's far from the truth. I'm gonna make a comparison to sandbox/survivalgames like minecraft here. One of the main reasons I don't care for such games is the timeconsuming thing about getting simple things done. This game does the opposite, though every quest in the game is a fetchquest of sorts. But I for one don't mind a fetchquest if it takes like 1 minute to complete and you're rewarded straight away with progression in the story.  The game will not last much longer than 3 hours so keep that in mind when you throw money at the screen.Protip: Sleep in camps, you will thank me later! :)			"

												If you are not interested in click point games, I do not recommend this game.Nevertheless, if you are interested in click point games, I should say while you are playing you do not notice what time is.Nevertheless, in the beginning you can be bored because of some ordinary things belonging to click point games.That is to say, from the middle of the game, the game will draw you in until you end game after 3-5 hours.The good thing is that the side quests and characters are enough to break cliche air of the game, yet main quests and events or at least the final quests makes you question worthiness of the game.However, the midst of the game are enough for playing a cheap game and to kill some time.

												I have owned this game for awhile but the other day I decided to start playing it out of boredom. I can honestly say this scratched the itch that I was feeling. It feels like a cross between a point and click adventure with some RPG-like elements and one of those hidden object games thrown in for fun. It's not overly complicated but has a lot to collect and do in a short amount of time. I managed to complete the game, and all 38 Steam achievements in about 4 hours. A good tip: When you start hunting bears you need poison. The first way to get it is to buy it from a shady guy, but don't buy it from him. Instead advance the story a little further till you unlock someone who will craft it for you for free.			"

There are only about 15 or so screens in the whole game to work with and yet nothing started feeling repetitive to me.

This will be a short review.Positives: - it's a short game (about 4 hours all up each time I've played it).                 - very easy to master game mechanics (if you haven't figured out point and click yet, well... I can't help you there)                - Very pretty artwork and music.Negatives: - very short (only 4 hours long) and very simple, so the normal asking price is a bit steep for what you're getting.                  - Very detailed fine artwork on a very high resolution screen means a lot of very intense squinting at very small pictures.                  - Re-playability is minimal (the drop locations and quantities for the collectables vary from game to game, but that's it.  Everything else is exactly the same).  Overall: I'd give it 6/10, rising to 7/10 when it's on sale.			"

												Great game for people who want an adventure game with very very limited difficulty.The game is made to be from a time long ago when we were only young adventurers. The game feels old and I will not give it a great review, but it was fun.The game play repeats but the story of our youthful adventures is all worth it.On a sale just buy it.This game gets a 6.5/10.

												I picked this game up without proper research and only judging it from the screenshots I saw. Surprisingly it was not the kind of game I expected but regardless turned out to be quite an enjoyable experience. The only sad part is that I didn't manage to get 100% of the 'collectables' in one playthrough so I have to play through it again to get it. That in itself is not so much a problem because it's still fun, but it doesn't offer any replay value in terms of experiencing a different adventure the 2nd time through.Basically, it's a point & click adventure in the literal sense that you will have to click.. a lot. The game is set up in a way that you could never fail it unless maybe you were deliberately trying to - and even then I question the possibility. For that matter it can be said that the game is somewhat of the easy nature. Really, the only real challenge in this game is getting 100% of the achievements / completion. The story is pretty straightforward and not really memorable but there are a lot of hidden 'secrets' and things to look out for which makes this a great game for those who are into exploration or putting their eyes and mind to the test.

												This was a decent point-and-click adventure. Graphics and music are very nice, writing is competent enough, puzzles are straightforward but not completely trivial. The plotline is utterly predictable, but the gameplay isn't excessively linear and some of the characters are cute (like the frogmen). It also lets you continue playing after you finish, so you can get all the achievements.Not a lot of replay value, and there's a certain amount of hunt-the-pixel involved in some of the puzzles and achievements, but overall a solid 5 hours' entertainment.

												-Recommended for easy and casual entertainment If you don't have much time, if you're exhausted or bored during a meeting you can play this one. It's like a phone game.In hero of the kingdom you basically click on different icons and you get / lose some ressources. It's super-casual playing and you can't really lose. In 3 hours concentrated playing you'll be getting 100% achievements.There is some ""hidden object""-clicking and finding secrets involved, you don't have to think much but it's nice to spot a treasure and get stuff like looking for easter eggs as a kid.The game is fun to play although it doesn't satisfy any hardcore gaming needs. Graphics and gameplay are child-safe.Oh and story is fantasy standard heard 1000 times and replay value is low.			"

												Excellent little game! At first I was worried because of the way it took me by the hand during the first 5 minutes or so. But my worries dissipated after the game and quests opened up wide to allow some interesting decision-making. It was just the right level of challenge to complete all of the achievements. The story, although not very original or believable, is imersive and entertaining. I see people complaining about 2 things and I'd like to adress them. 1 - ""It's like a facebook game"". People say that because of the energy system and kind of exploration + completing quests gameplay. Yes, the gameplay is really an interactive story with exploration, hidden objects, collection and trading, so be aware. On the other hand, it does not have those annoying time limits, inviting friends and premium currency. You don't even have to wait for your energy to be low to recharge it - there's no limit to how much energy you can carry so although it's not realistic, you can rest repeatedly and build up lots of energy to then do your actions. Also, this game has an END. It does not have seasonal events and added content. So I see a monstruous gap between this game and a facebook one, I love this game and hate the ones on facebook. Huge difference.2 - ""The game is too short"". For the people who say that, I recommend a youtube video called ""in defense of short games"", from the channel Extra Credits. They explain it a lot better than I could write here. But basically if people keep on judging games only by the lenght of the gameplay, we will get longer games that provides us a poorer experience. Everybody knows at least one TV series of movie franchise that got streched to the point it became so bad it was not worth watching. We need to end this way of thinking. The lenght was perfectly fine for me. I finished the game in 2 sittings of about 3 hous each, reading every dialogue line and getting all achievements before ending the game. Isn't that enough gameplay? There are too many other games out there I'd like to experience before getting stuck with a single game that provides ""endless gameplay"" or something.If I had to complain about one thing in the game, would be the pace of the action resolution sequences. Everytime an item drops, I need to collect it before moving on. Everytime I choose to perform an action, I need to wait until it is done to do something else. I'd like to be able to do several actions at once, clicking the next one before the previous one is completed, then collect their rewards. Or at least click several actions and ""queue"" them. It would make the game more dynamic. Also, the nighttime sequence is too long for something that will be repeated several times during the game.9/10			"

http://intronerdedliving.blogspot.ca/2016/03/hero-of-kingdom-game-review-1010.htmlHero of the Kingdom - Game Review - 10/10     Hero of the Kingdom is a casual point and click indie game for $7 on Steam. For a dollar value hour value, it lasted a little over seven hours which is right where I think a game should be priced. I don't play a lot of point and click games, so I took a chance on this one and was pleasantly surprised.     This is one of my favourite types of art-styles to look at, so I thought this game was absolutely beautiful the whole way through. The music was enjoyable to listen to all throughout. The gameplay was simple and crisp. You get energy by resting, then use that energy as a resource to complete other tasks.     One of my favourite parts of this game was as it introduced new things to you through tasks, you would be able to go back through previous areas and find things such as mushrooms or boxes hidden in the scenes. It was really quite fun to look through everything and complete the achievements, read the story, and play through this sweet little game.     To anybody who enjoys a nice casual game, or a rest from their competitive games for a while, I definitely recommend this game. As usual, if you can get this on sale, it's even more worth the price.     For me, this point and click game is a 10/10.~ Kyle			"

												This isn't really a game in the strictest sense; there is little challenge and there's not a thing in the game that can't be accomplished through simple planning. Yet it is a great story and I had a good time running through it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who would rather play more action oriented games or those that focus on player agency. This game isn't about action; it is about following along with it's story. If you can get through the make-work there is a really enjoyable experience to be had here. I'd say that it falls somewhere between an interactive novel and a minimalist ""walking simulator"" style of game with some hidden object and image hunting thrown in.Not for everyone, but a pretty good time for the right kind of player. Well worth the 5.99 price tag.			"

												While this game is no RPG at all, it is worth the buy on sale. Full price is not really a fair buy, as the game is really short (I got all the achievements) and has no replay value at all. It is essentially a casual clicker game with some hidden object dimension in it (more below). You go on from map to map, gathering food, objects, speaking to uninteresting NPCs, and accomplishing some dull quests for them. Yet, the game is catchy, and you can finish it in a row as it keeps being entertaining. You cannot die nor make mistakes, it is pretty easy, but it's fun. To make some more money (necessary for quests) you can grab some objects hidden on the maps, such as mushrooms, fishes, crevices, eggs, and you can hunt animals. Strangely enough, becoming the Hero of the Kingdom also means plundering it from all its natural resources. This hidden dimension is nice as the objects have not been put randomly: eggs can be found in the forest or on cliffs, mushrooms are found near the woods. Everything makes sense. The story has no interest at all. They could hardly have done a less interesting one. Too bad as it would have make the game better.Finally, the late game is tedious. You have to fish everything and hunt every animals, so you need energy and you spend most of your time sleeping. Repetitive fights (where a fight means gathering enough potions trhgouh trade and then automatically resolve it for a guaranteed win) are just utterly boring. Without the pleasure of discovering new areas as all the bad guys are found in already visited places, it looses all interest. Conclusion: A good game to buy on sale and spent a relaxing and entertaining yet too short time.			"

												So this was a quirky little game I've had my eyes on for a while. Having picked it up on offer, I decided to give it a run-through, and it was a generally pleasant experience. Nothing that stands out in particular in terms of what would set it apart from other games, but nothing that felt like it hampered my experiences either. If you have a few hours to spare and a bit of change, this is worth at least one playthrough to pass the time away. It doesn't have much of worth to bring you back for a second playthrough, but given a reasonable price point and it's worth the one time.The game is essentially a resource management simulation where you have to manage what you have, your energy, money and your skills to eventually become the ""Hero of the Kingdom"", and honestly, it's not too challenging provided that methodical progression is applied to everything, from levelling your capabilities to ensuring you have enough food or money for the next event you have to overcome. It does have some strategical layer of depth to it (case in point, you can simply buy certain things you need, but if you work on your skills you can get items for much cheaper than you would buying them) and I appreciated the layers that had been taken to reward those who did go a little extra in managing their resources more efficientlyA lot of the gameplay elements are easily visible event points, though one of the other draws of the game is an element of hidden object games, where you find items such as mushrooms or crates for extra items and money. Beyond these elements, it tends to play forward in a more point-and-click adventure game than your typical RPG (a great number of RPG elements are not present here, so if you are looking for an RPG experience, I would advise seeking this elsewhere) and the story it does tell through the story is a simple one, with a neat bow finish after the ending progresses. If any complaint could be thought of, it would be that there's no real sense of time passing by as any of these events transpire - and given that you can rest in camps without any effect to the story does not help in this regard.In terms of the art assets, the landscapes, the various icons and the people you get to see are pleasant to look at, with nothing looking out of the ordinary for a fantasy adventure. The game has a good sound quality to it, from the effects to the music, though it can sometimes be distracting when the track suddenly changes while you've been on a screen for a while without any change. All-in-all, though, the complaints that I have are minor and nit-picky, and did not detract from the fact that I did get enjoyment from the game overall, and while I clocked only about 4-5 hours and obtained all achievements (with others completing it in less time), it was a worthwhile 4-5 hours that I had spent without any regrets.In summary: While a short point-and-click adventure experience, it's hidden object and resource management elements helped keep the gameplay varied and entertaining, while the story and progression was balanced enough that it did not feel like it carried on for too long or too short a time, and it didn't leave any loose ends. It's lack of difficulty or replay value is an appeal for anyone seeking something to plug into for a few hours of their time, and the price value makes this at least worth a purchase on a sale, if not at full price.

												Took me about 3-4 hours to complete the game and get all achievements. It is a fun little game with an okay story. The game does get little boring nearer the end as it just becomes a matter of fast travelling between areas to buy what you need but the beginning and middle are excellent.			"

												Nice Adventure and casual game, good story, not to long and well designed maps. Looking for things is addictive and you can find things by clicking on the map which is very nice. Making money was also a lot of fun, there are some ways you can make inifinity money. And last but not least the achievements are not so hard to get, they are very well choosen, which is very important for me and makes the game easy to 100% if you want. I recommend it in any ways. :)			"

												Really a nice and well-made game!Although this type of genre (which is it btw?) is normally not mine I enjoyed it a lot and played it to the end in just two sessions. It took me roughly 3.5 hours to complete including all achievements.What I also want to note is that the game comes in 10 languages and at least in the English and the German version (I changed the language setting after an hour) I did not find any spelling mistake. As it is quite common nowadays that (also blockbuster) games have tons of grammar and spelling errors this is an indicator to me that this game is really well-done, probably also on the technical side. Btw, no bugs or crashes for me (-:			"

												Very simple game that is somehow very fun. The story is fairly straightforward and cliche (your typical hero goes on a quest to save the realm from a dark wizard), but the gameplay makes it very enjoyable.   The combination of point and click and hidden object is great - instead of having separate hidden object scenes, you can find useful things hidden in each location.  The game also definitely has replay value - I've played through a couple of times, and it's still fun even when you know the story.  The art is also nice - not unique, but pretty.			"

												This game is so simple but awesome enough to play twice! It doesn't take a nice PC/Mac to play this because it's simply clicking (but it feels like you're doing more). Here are the things I love about this game:It's sort of like an I Spy game in which you're trying to find resources in various landscapes - so that feels like a mini game in and of itself. And as you progress, you have to go back and look at old maps/landscapes to see what suddenly appears now that you have the skill to gather/hunt it, etc.There are a few crafting/assembly lines you can use to make money. Many you must use to progress in the game because you need a various item. For example, you end up needing bread quite often to heal/sleep and to help others. You can buy the grain, take it to the mill and pay for it to be ground into flour, then you take it to the bread maker, and then you sell it for a small profit. It takes patience but I love that it does because the reward is all the greater. It has acheivements which are super fun for completionists. I am still trying to get all of them - so close! I can't find a couple of things on any of the maps! But that is fun to me because it means more time playing the game of I Spy.The story progresses perfectly without hitches. There are no glitches and everything you need is basically given to you if you focus on progressing through each map before you complete everything in it. The more maps you have the more opportunities you have to gather/hunt/find the stuff you need for free. It also unlocks more things in the maps you need to go back to anyway. I can tell this game has been thouroughly tested for bugs.It's fun to make money in this game! Due to the assemply-line type of things like bread or potions, you end up doing some simple math to figure out who gives you the best deal on the supplies to gather, and who will buy what you've gathered for the highest price. Also, it's fun to figure out which camp is cheaper to camp in based on what resources you need to camp there. I can easily play this game in windowed mode at work. When I have nothing to do but want to look busy, I just pull it up and play. The simplicity of it makes it easy to be disracted from and come back to just to pick up where you left off. My only complaint is that the story is your typical saving someone you love just to find out that you have to defeat a bad guy to save everyone. That being said though, the story was fun enough.This game has obviously been translated from another language and is hilarious to read sometimes. Everything makes perfect sense but it's said in a way that sounds like a literal translation from one language to another with no account for the differences in grammar/common use of words between the languages. I think anyone who likes the types of things I mentioned above would love this game. My mom doesn't like most games, especially not adventure/RPG games, but I honestly think she would find this fun due to the ""puzzles"" (where to go to get what to solve various tasks) and the I Spy part of it. Be warned though - if you play windowed you need good glasses or good eyesight because things are tiny and very subtle. To me that makes it more fun though. PS the only reason I have logged over 100 hours on the game is because I've left it open in the background at work. Being anal about all the acheivements has given me about 10 hours of gameplay, versus the 4 others claim to have gotten out of it.			"

												This game is a puzzle/resource management game. It has nice oldschool graphics, with the feeling from the strategy medieval games from the 90s. It tries to simulate an RPG where you follow a story with your character and do a lot of fighting and tasks, but essentially you are just trying to find hidden stuff in the maps, or find your way through the dozens of maps that keep opening up, doing tasks like building, harvesting and helping people out. This is a game to play when you need to relax, because there ain't no thought envolved besides finding you way and what to do next. I don't think it is possible to ""fail"" in this game, unless you really try to, so everyone will probably finish it in no time. It is a short game.OCD people will have plenty of fun completing tasks, unlocking achievements and progressing, this is what this game is all about. I bought it during a sale and I can recommend it for low prices, otherwise, buy it  if you are a fan of casual games or are desperate for a feel of the 90s, but keep in mind the game is simple and short so most people will prefer to pay pocket change for it.

												Good storyline, pretty good gameplay, good small item finding afterwards for OCD achievement hunters.Great game all around, pretty fun and worth the price, especially if you buy it on sale.			"

												This may be a simple relaxing game, but I enjoyed it so much I went out and got the next one. It makes for a nice change of pace. You can't beat the price when it is on sale.			"

												Nice game for a rainy sunday or weekend. Played without pause and went through in roughly 7 hours including all sidequests and every achievement. So, if you're looking for a game, where you can get 100% ;)			"

												a sweet short 5-9 hour title in fantasy setting. tests your short-term memory. the animations are delightful. point and click casual. pick it up and put it down. doesn't drain pc resources much. i kept chrome and word open. lots of achievements. cute story though not original. enjoyed collecting resources and earning gold. overall enjoyable game. couldn't put it down. worth up to $9.99 for the hours of pleasure i got out of it.

												When I first started playing this game I thought... is this all there is to this game? But then I found myself playing it every spare moment I had, choosing it over other games! When I finished all the achievements, I kept playing a little longer because I enjoyed it so much. I agree with other reviewers that said this was a surprise game that they didn't think they would love as much as they do, this game is unexpectedly fun in its simplicity!			"

												What a surprise!A casual game? A hidden object gameplay?! A relaxing, clicking game that your noob sister could enjoy on Facebook?!?! Everything was here for me NOT to enjoy, and yet? This game is great! I was so surprised.The art is casual and simple but very neat. The musics are generic but easy listening. The story is obvious yet fine. And finally ? The gameplay! Ultra simple: you just click. Yet, you have to calculate paths in your head, and in this sense that game reminds me a bit of economic board game (Agricola and such).In the end, this game is very simple, pleasant and relaxing, and it has not BAD points, except maybe being too short! (around 5 to 6 hours to finish it I would say). Congrats to the developers because all the maths in this game economics surely must have been hard to set up.An unusually pleasant casual game! I am looking forward to play the 2nd one!			"

												This is a platform based game,I think it is a very nice game! Truly addictive since the beginning,has easy commands and it is very easy to get into the story.Very nice to spend 2-3 hours with a good game and the more you go ahead the more you want to discover.I liked quite much (i get all the achievements^^, btw not that hard)Suggested.
