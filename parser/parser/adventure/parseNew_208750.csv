												I'm a long time Mythology nerd who's looking into an archaeology major and reads about ancient history for fun. I logged into steam, saw this game on sale, and resigned myself to buying it.It was amazing.Media accurately depicting the Greek Gods is hard to find, and doubly so for video games. ""Someone is god of the wrong thing"" is a square on my mythology movie bingo card. But Apotheon completely nails everything. This game wasn't written by people who read through a couple wikipedia pages and called it day; literally everything about the Gods is correct, from their attitudes to their ironic demise, and even their allegences. One of the most telling moments was having Dionysus on the side of humanity; someone who'd only done cursory research wouldn't know that he'd lived among mortals for years before joining the gods.And don't even get me started on the art. This game is one of the most beautiful things I've ever played. Everything is stylized perfectly down to the creases in a character's chiton, and the color changes in the different realms are beautiful and perfectly fit the tone of the area. The architecture is accurate, as are the items and decorations. The NPC dialogue and major themes of the story even parallel important values of Ancient Greek life.Basically: the devs for this game researched the hell out of Ancient Greece, and I kind of want to kiss every one of them for it. 10/10.

												Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!In the beginning there was presumably chaos; the cosmos swirled violently, endlessly. But the gods, lazy control freaks that they are, swept all that chaos under the proverbial universal carpet and called it a full, rich day. Eons passed, and little of consequence was done: multicellular organisms developed, terra rose from beneath churning primordial seas, and the very first Waffle House opened to middling reviews. At some point (post Waffle House), the gods grew bored and reached out to indie game developer Alientrap. In a booming and unified voice, they decreed that a game be made – a sidescrolling, puzzle/platform adventure game that would do them honor. Little did the gods know that this particular genre of game would be pumped out with such regularity in the indie community that titans CoD and Madden would blush empathetically. Alientrap, like Sysiphus before them, faced an uphill battle.They succeeded, and did Olympus proud.Apotheon is the aforementioned sidescrolling puzzle/platform indie adventure game, and it tells a story as old (and as metal) as time: the gods of Olympus have forsook the cosmic “oopsy daisy” of mankind, and it's up to brave Nikandreos to save what little spark of humanity remains. Sure, roll your eyes. “Didn't God of War do this a decade ago?” Well sure, technically, you stick in the mud. Homer also wrote stuff in this vein nearly 3,000 years ago, and whoever the ♥♥♥♥ wrote Gilgamesh 1,300 years earlier than Homer still! And for what it's worth, the story is very fun. It doesn't break the ancient mold, but the ending still left me surprised and satisfied. Nikandreos sidescrolls his way up  hub-world Mount Olympus on his quest in stunning black and red figure style as seen depicted on all the best Ancient Greek pottery. Watching people stroll the market, guards brandishing their spears, and satyrs getting drunk is mesmerizing. But at some point you'll have to get to the gameplay, and what gameplay it is. You'll have an array of archaic weapons (purchased or picked up), a variety of shields, a torch, potions and the like. Weapons and shields shatter after prolonged use, so the game regularly forces you to fight in different styles. I was initially put off by this feature but found that it forced me out of my comfort zone, requiring me to learn the unique swings, reaches, and speeds of each weapon. You'll pick up money and crafting items after combat and by shattering crates and barrels, though these activities can bring unwanted attention from Olympian guards.Over the course of  three acts you'll deal with eight major deities (four optional), and each offers starkly different, fun, varied gameplay. For example, Demeter, Goddess of the Harvest, pities humanity's plight, and would provide bounty. Unfortunately her daughter Persephone currently dwells in Hades' realm making it impossible. You'll have to descend to the underworld, cross the river Styx, and proceed to cross the lesser rivers Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocyctus to be granted an audience with the Lord of the Dead. Each of these rivers provide different platform gameplay tropes that keep things fresh, exciting, and entertaining. And that's just for one “quest.” Dionysus, Hephaestus, Poseidon, Athena... each and every deity provides different gameplay mechanics so the game never gets stale. All the while you'll visit shops to upgrade your attack strength, defense, and resupply on favorite weapons.And for those of you with a multiplayer itch there's local multiplayer combat, allowing you to test your skills against a friend. This is pretty fun, and the combat (singleplayer and multiplayer) is deceptively deep and tactical. The multiplayer won't keep too many people distracted for long, but between the three difficulties, metroidvania-lite gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, stunning graphics, and varied gameplay, you'll sink at least 10 hours into this little indie game.This is AAA quality on an indie budget, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing out on this one. Apothoen has accomplished its 12 herculean tasks, and is deserving of a place in the pantheon of gaming.			"

												This game is rad. So many melee combat games have tried to find a satisfying balance between simplicity and granular control, and Apotheon absolutely nails it. Being able to toss a javelin, roll between the legs of an opponent, then send a slash up his back while his shield's still facing the other way makes me buzz like nothing else. Weapons feel distinct from one another and satisfying in their own ways. Though it didn't take long for me to discover my love of heavy-headed polearms, I'm always pleased when a situation calls for something different and I'm rewarded with an entirely different (though no less enjoyable) visceral interaction. There's something to be said for the intimacy of shield + knife.The world is pretty big, with a solid variety of enemy types and challenges, but what I thought was the coolest is how all if it was informed by Greek mythology. I was tickled when I realized I had to stab a certain enemy in the eye to bring him down.Also, if you've got a buddy on hand, the local arena mode makes for a fun time. They can try to kite you with arrows all they want, but all it takes is one well-placed javelin... (or a quick roll and slash combo... or a mighty leap with hammer in hand... etc.).All in all, if you like combat platformers with a dynamic rhythm, Apotheon won't disappoint. Strong recommend.			"

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 10ApotheonPurchase Date: 6/13/2015Long ago on my Commodore 64, I used to play a game called The Return of Heracles, which had a similar Greek myth setting.  So when I saw this game, I was pretty much immediately sold on the setting and the art style looked awesome.  This is one of the rare games I bought on Steam that I ended up playing almost right away.The game starts with some quick cut scenes explaning how Zeus has turned his back on mankind, and things are looking grim.   After that I found myself in a town being invaded by raiders, which is where the tutorial kicks in.The controls are pretty simple.  I didn't check if the game supports a gamepad or not, but I played with a keyboard and mouse.  The keys move you around and perform actions, and the mouse is used for aiming.  I've played other games with this control scheme; it's not my favorite, but it does feel familiar, and isn't difficult to pick up.Given the controls and the platform nature of the game, I was expecting the combat to be pretty simplistic.  Instead I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of weapons at my disposal.  Even better, the weapon differences are not just purely cosmetic.  Each weapon feels different.  Knives are quick and do small amounts of damage which add up over repeated strikes.  But after too many quick strikes I found myself gasping for breath.  Larger weapons do more damage but are slower, and can be trickier to hit with against a moving target.  A variety of ranged weapons are provided as well.It isn't long before I am introduced to the crafting options in the game.  I got a couple of recipes, one to make a 'fire bomb' of sorts, and the other for making a 'healing potion'.  The components for making these can come out of random crates or from killing enemies.I occasionally struggled with the map.  The map overlays the screen with a transparency effect that I sometimes had trouble distinguishing the map from the background.  I wished I could have had some control over the transparency here.  Otherwise though the map did a good job of highlighting the location of my current objectives and helping me find my way around.One thing I appreciated was the run speed of my character.  The longer you run, the faster you get.  So for those times where I needed to run far across the map, it doesn't feel like it's taking forever.As far as difficulty goes, the game starts out pretty easy.  The earliest fights are very simple and gave me a good opportunity to try out the different weapons.  At the end of the first area, I got into my first boss fight, where the game starts to ramp up the difficulty.  As I progressed into the next area, I started to encounter more of a variety of enemies, and I definitely noticed a continued increase in difficulty.  I found myself having to evolve my combat strategy as well.  Early on it was sufficient to simply stab enemies a few times before they could respond in kind.  But as the game progresses, I found myself leaping to dodge attacks, and having to approach combat more methodically, especially in some of the later boss fights.The graphics options are pretty basic, but that makes sense given that this is a 2D platformer.  I did see the option to change my resolution, which for me is always the most important.I ended my first hour of gameplay continuing to explore the forests of Artemis.  The game definitely gives you a decent amount of exploration.  It reminded me a little of Metroid in that regard.  Overall there really wasn't anything about Apotheon I didn't like.  I expect I'll be enjoying many more hours of fun in this game.  I can recommend this without hestiation. "

												I just finished Apotheon, and wow, did I enjoy this game!  It's such a great game.  The art style is obviously awesome.  Unless you hate orange, in which case steer clear.  It's a wicked beautiful game and they nailed the Greek Pottery aesthetic.The game focuses primarily on combat, and don't let anyone tell you it's anything less than stellar.  Yes, it takes some getting used to.  This is a style of 2D combat that in a league of it's own.  1 part Terraria, 1 part Dark Souls, and yet totally unique somehow.  Once you get the hang of it, properly dodging and timing the perfect devastating blow is incredibly satisfying.  This really should be played on a keyboard and mouse, though, as precision is a big factor in combat.  Also, it's much safer to switch weapons by going into your inventory by pressing ""i"" instead of hitting a number key and scrolling, while trying to dodge enemies.The music is perfect, The voice acting is good, and I love the story, because it minds me of all the time I spent reading Greek mythology for fun when I was a kid.  I think the ending is just freaking perfect.It's got plenty to do.  I spent 10 hours playing, and didn't spend a lot of time exploring and many sections I ran and dodged by dozens of enemies.  So there's plenty of time to spend here if you look for everything and do all the side stuff.My only real complaint is that there are just too many weapons that you hang onto all at once.  I would have preferred just 2 or 3 melee weapons, and 1 or 2 ranged.  As it is, I just had a lot of stuff that I never needed to use, so there was no sense of urgency.  Also, I realize they were going for an ""ammo"" feel by having weapons degrade and breakdown ... but I'm not sure that helped the game.  It seemed like an unnecessary convention, and the only time it remotely effected me was when my assassins dagger broke, but I just ran and bought a cheap one from the black market dealer.Anyways ... I highly recommend this game, and that you take the time to learn and appreciate the combat.  I have a feeling that this'll be a sleeper-hit, and once online multiplayer is up there will be renewed vigor for Apotheon!			"

												Great animation, visuals and artwork. Superb soundtrack and very good voice acting and effects.The gameplay is not that easy, as you have to coordinate your attacks and where to look with the mouse at the same time and it becomes really difficult at large number of enemies or crucial boss fights.The story is interesting and some of the maps are very fun to play. I also loved the various ancient Greek names and the mythology references.Recommended game.			"

Tl'dr version:  As a classicist and avid reader of mythology I consider this a hidden gem of the metroidvania genre. A good story and decent combat, coupled with the most immersive and unique artstyle I have ever seen seen makes this a must buy for anyone who wants to put a toe into Greek mythology or metroidvania games. A Controller is highly recommended however.Elaborated version: As stated above, I consider myself a individual well verse in Greek myth and it's Aesthetics. I say this in regard to why I think this game is probably the first of it's kind to seamlessly blend Greek iconography into a video game. The art is immediately distinctive, and go's beyond just a pretty backgroundThe art work is a stark reminded that this is actually how people; circa 500-300BC did ART, with some of the darker levels (Hades' realm for example) styled in old Athenian ""BlackFigure' style, while the majority of the game plays in different palettes. The God's themselves are the stars of the show; with some being monstrosity tall and the ability to deal gigantic damage to boot, or the more cunning Gods, which use cunning or subterfuge to try and stop you.I won't go into the story too much. The simple plot remains that the Gods have turned against humanity and Nikandreos, resident Greek villager turned Epic Hero must stop them from wiping them out. If this sounds cliche, that's because it is, but only to the modern eye. We live in a society where most media have butchered much of Greek Myth. This is not one of those pieces of media. Apotheon  reflecting a far older brand of storytelling. Unfortunately, players will probably notice the game shares many of its narrative threads with God of War, but the differences pile up quickly. Where God of War sticks to video game tropes, Apotheon is content to ground itself in ancient myth. I find this to be a strike in Apotheon's favor.In gameplay terms it's 2-parts Castlevania or Metroid, and 1-part Legend of Zelda 2. During this side scroller you'll forced to engage in combat and a little bit of platforming and open level design which scrolls in all directions. Each of the game's areas contains various objectives that must first be completed, then usually conclude against  the realms master as a boss, or trial.The common pit falls of it's genre show through however. Too often you'll find yourself wailing on an enemy hoping that a good hit lands, or that you're weapon won't suddenly snap in two and you'll be left with only a dagger to poke at the giant Cyclops roaring for your nu**s. Another common problem I found was that sometimes, when both parties were melee focused, we'd be hacking at each other with neither hitting because the hitboxes didn't register super close hits. Everything else seems to be good however. You can use a multitude of different weapons to kill your enemy's with including Spears, Bow&Arrows, Swords, Maces, Glaves, Hammers, Rocks, and explosives.Soundtrack wise; it's passable. I found myself mildly surprised that a game with such insane visuals would have such a mediocre OST. To be fair however, soundtracks are often one of the harder development processes for Indie devs.Final thoughts: An exceptional oddity in our world of graphical powerhouses' like Crysis and Battlefield. This game to me looks better than all of them simply due to it's art style. The combat is rock solid to, and the game boasts a fun story for you to keep you invested.Slightly harder to justify at Retail price, but under any discount this becomes a steal. A definite recommendation to anyone with a passing interest in myth, Metroidvania, or looks for a fun distraction.• Good Combat, If a little clunky• Good Story• Gorgeous and Unique visuals• Reasonable length.

												Apotheon~~~~~~~~  Apotheon is a well structured 2D platformer based on Greek mythology.  You play Nikandreos and you have an epic fight ahead of you against the gods. The Greek artwork is really well done and the atmosphere will captivates you in this frantic era.   The levels are fairly large, therefore you will find it extremely useful to use the local and world map to pinpoint where you are. You can also use the map to find ancient writing. You will be able to gather plenty of weapons like spears, arrows, swords, axes and much more.  In terms of protection, armours and shields are pretty much it. Mind you, you can find upgrades for your armours which are often in chests. Crafting, health potions and fire bombs (Greek fire in the game) are vital to your success.In regards to the combat interface is actually good but it will take you a little bit of time to master all the different aspects of it. Be prepared to use all buttons on your gamepad. It can be challenging at times. Positives:~~~~~~~~ -	Great artwork and atmosphere-	Large levels-	Challenging-	Stacks of things to collect  and do-	Achievements-	Trading cardsNegative:~~~~~~~~ -	Controls a bit challenging at the start (Gamepad)Apotheon is a little gem. If you enjoyed Guacamelee you will love this game.9.5/10MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												There is something really satisfying about Apotheons fighting system.  Swapping through weapons to try new tactics out is a blast.Also, if you happen to find a really big rock you can pick up at some point, do yourself a favor and huff it at someones head.Pair this up with well drawn, greek pottery inspired art, a powerful soundtrack, and some pretty solid voice work, and Apotheon comes out as a quality title definitely worth checking out.

												A preface: I'm very reluctantly not recommending this game. It was a gift, for one, and secondly I really wanted to like it on its own terms. I'm a Classical scholar, and the concept is all kinds of wonderful. But I feel duty bound to be honest to anyone thinking of buying the game, so here we go:Pros:+ The art style is superb. I feel like this game could have been a top-notch animated film. It's not only beautiful but steeped in the iconography and lore of the ancient Greeks. Could not be better.+ The music, likewise, is evocative and well suited to the gameplay.+ The concept of an ancient Greek themed platformer inspired by pottery is fantastic.Meh:= The story was simplistic. This is something that could appeal to some but not all gamers. = If you're familiar with ancient Greek epic, religion, or myths at all, you might have some moments of frustration. I knew the hero was making some really poor choices but, as with any linear game, you have to go along with it. Some might find it a refreshing twist on the old stories.Cons:- What other reviews have said about the combat is, sadly, true. The controls are terrible on KB and mouse.- Combat feels floaty. There were several moments when enemies killed themselves, threw themselves out of the level including an elite. It is also possible for one boss battle, at least, to become glitched if a required item is knocked out of the level by the boss.- Boss battles have neat gimmicks but are implemented poorly. Each boss has been less about challenge and working out a strategy, or being skilled, but simply having the patience to grind it down.  "

												Apotheon is a real gem of a game from a very involved developper. The fact that this game managed to pull me in and provide a memorable experience despite the fact that I don't generally like side-scrolling action is a testament to its charm. While Apotheon shamelessly borrows from Capsized (the dev's previous release, which I also highly recommend BTW), it still manages to offer something special. The fabulous atmosphere created by the original art style and music, the highly responsive technical real-time combat, and surprising variety of scenarios and playstyle options make this an overall above-average game, especially for a smaller developper.   PROS:-Great ambiance with unique graphics, excellent music/sounds and real voice acting(!)-Engaging story and lore delivered in a non-interfering way-Simple and responsive controls with high freedom of movement-No real frustrating/annoying puzzles blocking your progress-Tactical, real-time combat is fast-paced and satisfying-Boss fights are well designed and require some quick adaptation-Huge selection of historically accurate weapons allow some playstyle options-Good amount of optional content (secrets, extra locations and ""side quests"")-Nice variety of locations, objectives and scenarios-Involved and dedicated dev who actually cares about the productCONS:-Fairly short campaign (CAN be a PRO if you're busy and like actually finishing games)-Limited replay value-Late game balance is real cake-mode unless switched to higher difficulty-Some boss encounters can be frustrating until you figure it out-Somewhat lacking crafting/inventory system feels a bit incomplete  TL;DR - There is very little I can say against this very original and well-executed game: 100% worth the price and time.

Posted: January 9, 2016
Summary:Apotheon is a metroidvania platformer with really unique combat and visual style, combined with great soundtrack. Combat style revolves about proper timing and aiming, even with melee weapons - your enemies dodge your attacks pretty often, don't expect anyone going easy on you. But melee fights aren't everything, you'll have to be prepared also on ranged combat - you can shoot arrows and throw javelins or just any weapon you're just holding. Combining the right attack strategy for fights make a huge difference.What excels on Apotheon is the visual style of Ancient Greek, where also the story goes. These graphics might not be winsome for everybody but it's nice to see the level of details developers put into it. Anyway, it's not their first platformer (as you may already know Capsized, for example), so it's great to see how they are getting better and innovating the genre.Pros:- Combat system that requires to be precise. Spamming attacks will not get you so far here.- Two difficulty settings. The second one is great for those who want to make Apotheon more like Dark Souls experience. The enemies won't be only stronger, they'll also interrupt your attack if they slash first.- Ancient Greek environment. Made to the eye candy level of graphics, just great to watch all the details.- Nice soundtrack. Cons:- Beware, if you have a GPU combined with integrated GPU, you'll have to manually switch GPU in your driver settings.			"

												If I could give this a recommendation somewhere between yes and no, I would definitely be doing it. However, I'm saying yes because it's worth a playthrough, BUT only if you can get it on sale. To summarise why:Pros:- Gee golly this game is beautifully designed when it comes to the art style.- It doesn't pretend to be something innovative. It's a sidescrolling action/adventure game and it knows it.- The stamina system makes for an interesting combat mechanic, making you choose when to strike a little better instead of just flailing away until things die.- There's actually quite a large array of weapons in this game. Bows, spears, swords, maces and shields all come in many varieties. Just enough to keep things interesting, anyway.- Really easy achievements if that what you're in to.Cons:- The controls are terrible. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. I've spelled it out for you, just in case. Plain and simple it's just a nightmare to aim, swing a sword, jump from ledge to ledge.. Hell, just about everything.- Tedious. It's mainly fetch quests with some puzzles thrown in every now and then. It is fun for the most part, but can get a little tiresome in a long session.It's also very short but I wouldn't know which section to put it in as it could be seen as good or bad, depending on your views of the game anyway.So in short. Buy this game if it goes on sale. If it doesn't, you should probably avoid it.			"

												This game, simply, is amazing and great. A nice break from blockbuster games like Far Cry, GTA, Skyrim, etc., the game took me roughly 10 hours to beat and obtain every single achievement (except the ""beat the game a second time"" achievement, which can be acquired using a small glitch). The music is very nice and adds to the overall feeling and emotion of the game. There is plenty of classic ""Greek/Roman"" music--what you would imagine playing in epic scenes of Greek/Roman Movies. Gameplay-wise, there is some room to be filled. Controls are totally fine on Keyboard, but there were many small times where I wish there was some better ease of controls (i.e. I had to manually go into inventory to change weapons. You can hotkey Primary/Ranged/Tertiary/Potion, but within each of the slots you need to manually go into inventory to switch). Hitting enemies is also sometimes hit or miss (pun intended?), as if the enemy is layered on top of you, your attack might not register as hitting them. However, there is lots to explore and enjoy throughout the entire game. If this game looked interesting to you, do yourself a favor and pick it up during a sale if you need that little boost of incentive. Overall, a solid 8.5 out of 10. Although marred by a few problems that can be easily overlooked, this game appeals to the senses and really executes what it set out to do in a brilliant and spectacular way.			"

												What's the first thing you think of when you think of ancient Greece?  No, not that!  Get your mind out the gutter, you degenerate!  Okay, what's the second thing?  Right!  The awesome myths of heroes and gods!  You think of Odysseus blinding the cyclops, Zeus overthrowing the titans, and... uh, Heracles mucking out some stables!  Yeah, that's the ticket.With all these feats of heroism wouldn't it be sweet if there was a video game that took place in ancient Greece, so that we too could test our mettle against these gods and monsters?  What's that?  God of War?  No, no.  That won't do at all.  I'm talking about something that wasn't pushed through the filter of what thirteen year old boys think is cool.  Something that's got fun gameplay, sure.  But something that keeps it classical, you know?  Preserves the tone and character of the myths.  Fortunately for us, we've got Apotheon.Assuming you've at least looked at the screen shots, I don't need to sell you on Apotheon's visual aesthetic.  It just looks great.  Bold black character models, flattened in profile, placed on warm background colors and intricate patterns do an excellent job of making you feel like you're playing an ancient Greek vase come to life.It's clear a lot of work was put into Apotheon's visuals, but I'll admit, I almost passed on Apotheon, since I was concerned there might not be any substance behind the style and very little was said about it when I first had a look.  It's too easy to fall into the ""art game"" trap, these days.  I grew still more concerned in a different way when some of the voice acting for the early game's enemies intruded on the stately visuals with an out of place cockney sounding accent.  And still more worried when it introduced the main conceit of the game as ""the gods have taken their gifts from man and it's up to you to overthrow them one by one.""Ugh.  Groan.  Spit.  We're really doing the God of War thing?  We're really giong to treat the Olympians as one big boss rush?  No concern for all the gods' benevolent qualities?  No mention of the heroes they helped, the customs they preserved?  Just gonna treat them as absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥♥all the time?  Ladies and gentlemen, I will confess that I was genuinely worried that upon my descent into Hades I would find the big man himself putting on his best James Woods playing Hades-as-the-Christian-devil before a meat-head slam down as the hero against an irredeemable evil.But, mercifully, for its couple of worrisome first impressions, Apotheon never went that route.  Yes, you do play as the mortal hero, Nikandreos, on his quest to conquer Olympus and steal the gods' powers.  And, yeah, that concept's a little off-base from the mythology, but Apotheon always manages to treat the source material with a great deal of knowledge and respect and it gets all of the points for that.  Aside from the odd intro enemies, the voice acting is good and, I would say, necessary for presenting the extreme personalities of the Greek gods.  Most importantly, their characters are preserved.  Oh yes, your encounter with Ares will be a slaughter-fest bordering on supernatural Hulkamania, but that's befitting the charcter of Ares.  Your meeting with Hades on the other hand is one of a number that pass without violence and with a lot of understanding for your plight.  And just to ensure that the fight-the-gods premise is pulled off with panache, Apotheon makes sure to vary its gameplay to suit the gods' realms and keep each climactic encounter with the gods themselves true to their characters.  I knew, for instance, that I was in for something special when my showdown against Artemis took the form of a demented game of tag, with the role of hunter and prey switching as I navigated the level.In Poseidon's realm you get to ride a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horse!  People who know about mythology just came!Sorry, I got excited there.  The fundamental gameplay for Apotheon is fairly simple.  You can attack with an absurd variety of ancient weapons: spears, swords, axes, pitchforks, bows, javelins, rocks, the power of love, an arrow that's three arrows, a flying saucer, a sword on fire....  Look, it's a big list, okay?  And you can block with a shield if you have one equipped.  You can adjust the angle of your attack with melee as well as ranged weapons to sneak blows past enemy shields.  But despite the extreme variety of weaponry, your equipment will break on you mid-battle.  Normally, I'd question the setting's decision to make equipment out of paper mache, but it was the bronze age, I guess. Combat gets fairly frantic as you and your opponents are smashing each others' shields and you dodge roll around like Sonic the effin' Hedgehog while you scramble to pull out your next favored weapon.It's gets a bit metroidvania-ish with you being able to explore large areas of Olympus right out of the gate.  There are lots of secrets to find and reasons to backtrack, athough the game is about as good at rewarding the player as someone saying ""open your mouth and close your eyes.""  More on that later.  It's also a bit step platformer-y, with movement focused on jumping and climbing around on your environment.  Nothing really unique, but it works.There are some RPG elements where you can buy upgrades to speed and damage with various weapon types, but it's minimal.  You start with everything you need right out of the box.But it wouldn't be like an ancient urn without some cracks in it, would it?  The core gameplay is weak when it comes to precision.  I found that the arrow telling me where I was aiming with my ranged weapons only had a token resemblance to where my attack was actually going and that made a few puzzles that relied on that precision tedious.  The sheer volume of weapons can also quickly become a hindrance.  Yes, you will need a lot of weapons since they break quickly.  But it sucks to cycle through your huge inventory looking for the next spear weapon in the heat of the fight, especially since they aren't placed next to each other for some reason.  It also makes one wonder why Nikandreos can't drop some swords and axes to hold more spears if you happen to have been giving him more proficiency with them.On the huge inventory note, there's also a crafting system that feels a bit gratuitous.  Yes, the potions and things you can make are useful.  But so often, I found myself overburdened with materials that only had one or two specific uses, I couldn't help but wonder, ""Is this necessary?  Could you maybe have just given me the final product instead of making me go through this extra flow-breaking step.""  And as I've briefly mentioned, Apotheon doesn't seem to know how to reward questing and exploration.  I did one side-quest for an optional god and ended up with something that increased the duration of poison damage.  There aren't any weapons that do poison damage. No, really, I didn't find any and I found everything.  You also get a grappling hook for another elaborate sidequest that allows you to explore absolutely ♥♥♥♥-all you couldn't without it.  Generally, there's very little reason to go after all the secret treasures.  Odds are you've found one or two weapons you really like and that chest is going to contain those special sling bullets you are already maxed out on because you never use them or a backstabbing dagger in a game without real stealth mechanics.But for its flaws, Apotheon's gameplay feels shield-shatteringly epic and suits the mythology well.  I'm always happy to pick some nits, but the broad strokes are exactly what they need to be.Indeed, short of including butt-stuff mechanics, I'd say that Apotheon has everything you need to get the full experience of epic Greek mythology.  It's certainly the best take on the subject material I've seen to date and it's just good fun.			"

												Apotheon is one of the best side-scrolling games I have ever played. The gameplay is solid, including both combat and puzzles; the artwork is beautiful; and the story is a fantastic take on the mysterious Dark Age of ancient Greece. As a Classicist myself I found this game pleasantly familiar and the depictions of various Gods and Heroes are incredibly true to the mythology, something very rare in games based in the ancient periods. Furthermore, players can learn more about the mythology they are immersing themselves in by reading little passages from ancient texts located around the areas. I cannot recommend this game enough. I really enjoyed my time playing it, and truly felt by the end that I had achieved Apotheosis.And who doesn't want to be a capricious ancient Greek God?			"

												It's fantastic, lot's to do in this game. It's actually very long, 10+ hours to get through most of the game. I missed a few things so I'm going back to complete more. There are heaps of boss fights and each level provides something unique to the world. I'm happy that not only does this game look amazing, they've spent a lot of time on the levels and is a complete game.Combat is not hack and slash. You are going to need to block and time your attacks, and can get challenging at parts. Almost like a 2D Dark Souls. Except without the punishing difficulty because it still lets you Quick Save. (Although there are difficulty options that can make it way way harder for those that like that)So other things that make this game awesome:+ Fun challenging combat becoming more satisfying as you grow stronger. ENDING IS GREAT+ Switch between weapons easily, carry more than 10+ weapons at a time because why not.+ Weapons break after too much use, which forces you to rethink your combat strategies. Keeps the game fresh.+ Works great with Keyboard + Mouse, gamepad works fine too. I decided to use Keyboard and Mouse as I prefer the precision of a mouse when using long range weapons.+ Quick Saves, and multiple save slots.Things missing for me, - NEWGAME+ mode would be great - Greek Language voice audio would complete the immersion.Thank you AlienTrap for this fantastic game. I wish there were more games with Ancient Greek Mythology.			"

												Apotheon, the game that is most well-known for its looks. The style mimicking the one of  ancient greek pottery feels strikingly unusual and memorable. If only ancient greeks knew. Or maybe they did, but you surely won’t know it from this game. As predictable as it seems, the story revolves around killing gods in order to take their godly powers from them; and as revenge on them for being sadistical mass-murdering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The olympic dwellers had decided that the mortals are “not worthy” anymore and all quit their god-jobs. There’s no more sun rising and setting; the soil has lost all its fertility. People are starved. As a result there’s banditry. So you find your hero in the midst of a raider attack on his village. Nikandreos fights them off effectively and makes it to the high ground, where the Hera's temple is originated. She offers him assistance in solving his people misfortunes by killing Zeus, who is portrayed like a constantly horny idiot making all of this just on a whim. Not that it isn’t accurate according to myths. After all we’re talking about a guy, who turned himself into a ♥♥♥♥ing swan to♥♥♥♥♥♥a daughter of king of Sparta, right?So you’re sent to Olympus and there’s all that familiar jazz dating back to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. There’s a map where exact locations of where you should be going right now are marked with your goals noted; usually it’s something like “acquire the aegis of Athena”. Sometimes it  doesn’t even involve killing another god, because of course there are those among deities who are sympathetic to humans, but can’t do anything except provide you with tasks of going to dangerous places and doing all that fighting along the way. The map isn’t uncovered initially though, so these arrows are just indicators of general “right” direction. Somewhere you need to go, rather than can. What you can is to start wandering around uncovering secrets and hidden areas, secret caches with upgrades and weapons or even vendors selling some potions or recipes for summoning stuff. As far as optionality goes you don’t even need to acquire all the gods’ powers available in the game but can instead stick only to mandatory ones, those with tiny arrows attached.If not in terms of amount of such content, but in a sense of proportion of it in the core experience Apotheon surely took notice of what first Dark Souls did. Same is true for combat mechanics of the game. You’ve got a stamina bar which is used for blocking with left trigger on the gamepad and attack on the right one; there are combat rolls and tons of weapons with different attack animations. Cautionary exploring is rewarded and smart tactics can save you a lot of trouble. Knowing your weapon, its speed and reach is a must; handling it properly is even more so. To keep things spicier there’s need to actually target your weapon with a right stick, which takes place of the positioning depth of 3d games. You can just try to mash attack facing in general direction of a nearest surprisingly tanned ancient greek god or his eternally respawning minion, but if would be hardly effective. Enemies try to dodge, block and reposition themselves as much as you do, so catching them mid-flight with a pointy tip of your weapon at least sometimes would be life-saving. To make things even more complex the game throws in an ability to use ranged weaponry and even throw your main equipped one right in the surprised face of another evil cyclops. On top of that there’s traps, armor system, health regeneration system, environmental weapons like big blocks of stone lying around here and there. Upgrades apart from gods’ powers are bought with gold and either are pieces of armor or static bonuses with percentage of attack speed and damage added to certain types of weapon. This works for a world where weapons break all the time, and those “repair kits” don’t actually repair anything, but just fill up that armor bar. Thankfully you’re not really limited around in what you can bring to another fight. You can’t have two of one weapon type for a few exceptions, but you can carry all your armory within their respective limits in those non-existent ancient greek pockets of yours. Axes, lances, swords, arrows, throwing rocks — everything can be used considering you’ve dealt with controls while dodging all those life-threatening stuff.Of course finding those ingredients for potions and refilling a stock of preferable spears takes some time. In a few hours breaking all the boxes and looking for them outside of a scope of main adventure will be usual. Wandering around and exploring actually helps, so it becomes natural. In the middle of another house break-in when another citizen of Olympus will offer to you “take what you want and leave”, you may even question yourself what is a real motivation of our hero is. Revenge? Hope to help mankind? Lust for power? Isn’t robbing wrong? But then the game throws in another factually correct retelling of another myth, and you can see who’s the real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here. A musical contest with a mortal for any wish where the obvious winner wishes to flay the loser alive — how does that sound? In the script of the game that stands for some stabbing and acquiring Apollo’s lyre. Making a way through the game’s world while engaging in interesting combat and enjoying the view accompanied by a good symphonic soundtrack is engaging. As for the story, it focuses more on epic battles and general translation of a end-of-times feeling. That is enough to make a great game.			"

												I like this game, the art style is unique.The game can last for 8 hours, although the story is satisfying it does need some improvements.- Gameplay is alright, variety of weapons but the weapon merchant is pointless. You can just pick those weapons up from the ground.- Story is mixed, you don't have a connection with the people you are saving. It's just a ""Save me!"" and you go off to be the hero. No background about the character that I can see. However the personalities of the Gods are brilliant, the majority of boss fights were fun, but not as challenging as say Dark Souls.- I was a bit disappointed there was an option for playing co-op local, but not online.- Game is early (or at least when this review was made.) So there are crashes, I encountered one just before the finish which disappointed me. Especially when having a satisfying end.But what surprise me was that there were some pretty good puzzles and levels, as I mentioned earlier the boss fights were fun and the change of scenery was nice. Also the lore, quotes and sources that were used in the game is an excellent touch. Would I recommend this game? Definitely!			"

												After playing this for almost 20 hours during the mid-late beta, I can't help but recommend it. Easily one of the best action platformers I have played in recent memory.- Immersive, unique style - but more than just a pretty face.- Satisfying combat that can be very rewarding on higher difficulties. - Encourages varying fighting styles, with heaps of unique weapons. Fight up close with sword and shield, keep your enemy at a distance with spears, or attack from afar with a bow. - Unexpectedly varied gameplay. Every area offers something new, in both visuals and gameplay.- A fun 2-player battle mode (just remember to bring two controllers). "

												When I was a kid, I'd go through photos of Greek black-figure pottery and get stoked about how action-packed it was. I was also a fan of Greek mythology. NOW IT'S A GAME!I've played a few hours of the campaign mode so far, and it's fun. Cool weapons, bloody kills, fluid movement, beautiful artwork and sound. Also - YOU CAN THROW ALL YOUR WEAPONS which is a good laugh, especially when they connect with a dude's neck.I've been streaming a few hours of gameplay on twitch.tv/w0lfrock if you haven't seen any Let's Play video yet.Using an xbox360 controller and the controller support is good. I can see how using a mouse / keyboard would be a little easier with aiming, but I'm happy using a controller.Local arena mode is a little like Nidhogg, but with a variety of weapons and boulders. The arena mode is NOT ONLINE, which would be awesome if they had it but would probably add quite a bit to the dev budget. Solid game, easily worth it at full price. Especially if you're buying it in CDN$ (Steam games are cheaper in Canada right now than in the USA because of the horrible exchange rate, shhhh!)			"

												All you really need to know going into Apotheon is this:Mount Olympus is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. You are Nikandreos, humanity's last hope against Zeus and his family of mongrels. In case you missed the thumbs-up, I like this game. Consistency is an oft-overlooked aspect of game-design. Apotheon's art-direction is essentially patterned after ancient Greek paintings. If you ever looked at some pottery and wondered ""What if someone made a side-scrolling action game out of this?"" this is about as close a result as you could imagine. Going further, Apotheon's art-direction affects how the game is played. Everything animates in a very stiff manner. It's off-putting at first, and likely won't gel with fans of franchises such as Castlevania. This is what makes consistency such a double-edged sword. This game couldn't have its unique visuals AND the mechanics/animation of a traditional side-scroller, it would look weird.Combat is all about commitment. Your defensive options are varied and effective at any moment. However, when you swing your sword, stab with your spear, or fire an arrow, you're going to be extremely vulnerable. Aiming & timing are essential; if both aren't true, you're going to take damage. While your skills can be upgraded, attacking is never instantaneous. Most of the time, you have to give your attack half a second to connect, and button-mashing is futile. Encounters tend to be short, as enemies can be killed in a few solid strikes. Furthermore, certain techniques (such as aiming for the legs) can force the enemies to crumple, leaving their head exposed to a critical strike. The other interesting aspect of combat is that weapons are fragile. While it's expected that players will find armanents that suit their play-style, it's also common that they'll have to make do with what's available. This tends to keep every encounter fresh, since the player can't afford to exhaust their favorites. Thankfully, Apotheon is balanced in the sense that bosses or other tough enemies don't require the ""best"" weapons. The boss-fights are mostly unique, and tend to involve unexpected events. In short, intuition and reflexes are the weapons you should rely on. In my play-through I got by relying almost entirely on common weapons. In true Resident Evil fashion, I saved all of my best stuff for...that time after I beat the game and realized that maybe I should have used some of it. Perhaps on the harder difficulty I'll be a little less frugal. Hades, I didn't even touch the ability-boosting potions. Sure they provide temporary boosts, but that's still better than nonexistent. Exploration is also a common element of this game. Each area has numerous secrets, most of which are hidden behind cracked walls and floors. Rewards are typically in the form of gold, weapons, and sometimes even God-granted powers. However, one aspect that is a bit disappointing is that there really aren't any powers that assist in exploration, or allow you access to new areas. Aside from bombs -- which are acquired as early as the first dungeon -- there aren't any techniques that allow Nikandreos to jump higher, fly, or reach areas he couldn't before. A side-quest unlocks a weapon called the Caduceus. It has a grappling mechanism that can be used on faraway objects, or even as a makeshift weapon. It's even possible (if a little finicky) to grab ledges to pull yourself onto. Unfortunately, this weapon can't be used to find new areas. Basically, this game is less Metroidvania than I expected, which is a little disappointing.Apotheon shares innumerable commonalities with the genre, but it does just enough to stand out. Keep in mind though that the art-direction and its resulting combat is *sigh* not for everyone. Some gamers will discount it as clunky and cheap, and that's fine. Everything immediately clicked for me, so I had a pretty good time with the game.			"

												I'm not sure about the label 'platformer' for this game. To me, a platformer game is a much more basic, even simplistic game genre. Yes, Apotheon has a basic platformer layout but the game doesn't consist of jumping from platform to platform, timing each jump carefully to avoid things or to avoid falling to your death. There are only two instances where Apotheon really felt like a platformer but one of those is completely optional (Dionysus) and the other is a very original take on platforming (Athena). If Apotheon is a platformer, it is to modern platformers what 'Gods' was to the SNES and Sega Megadrive (Genesis) consoles. Fun fact: both games are set against a background of ancient Greek mythology, but I digress...I would rather like to describe Apotheon as a 2D action adventure game with basic roleplaying elements, reminiscent of 'hack and slash' games. The game is mainly about combat. Although not perfect, the combat system in Apotheon is pretty decent. There are several types of weapons, each with advantages and disadvantages (speed, range, damage). You can use a shield to block. There is a stamina bar to make you think about your tactics, as opposed to allow you to just spam the attack button. Weapons degrade over time and break pretty quickly. At first, I didn't like this but soon I came to realize it had two important advantages: - if you woud be able to use the best weapon throughout the whole game, it would be way too easy and therefore no fun - this way, you're forced to use different weapons fairly often, making the game more varied and therefore more funThe story: you are Nikandreos, a warrior whose home town gets destroyed because Zeus (king of the gods) thinks it's time to eradicate humanity because its creation didn't turn out the way he'd have liked. So Hera (queen of the gods) suggests you take up arms and go to Mount Olympus to usurp the powers of each of the main gods, either by proving yourself to them or by defeating them, in order to defeat Zeus. That's it, the whole story of the game. This is no game you play for its elaborate, deep story. The fun is exploring the realms of the gods, each satisfyingly different enough and each with one or more boss fights, which are mostly well-thought-out and exciting fights.About the RPG elements: - there is an extremely limited skill system: you can purchase training for 4 levels of skills for the weapon types (sword, axe, spear, mace, bow) - more importantly, there are quite a lot of side quests. Even though they are pretty basic (explore, kill or loot), they are varied and interesting enough to pursue. Here I have to specifically mention the Steam Achievements. There is an achievement for each sidequest. This makes doing these quests feel rewarding. Also, you can start from the achievements and see them as a 'quest log' if you want to make sure you don't miss anything.- there are 'quest hubs' with merchant npcs, with npc houses to explore (and loot!) and with guards who will attack you if they see you you steal or attack anything or anyone.There is also some crafting of utility items (health potions, armor repair hammers, bombs to throw, ...) to add to the mix. Yes, the art style is 2D and looks very simplistic, but it's actually quite easy on the eye and it fits the game and its settings perfectly. The length of the game is perfect as far as I'm concerned. I estimate it took me about 20 hours and by the time I was about to take on Zeus, even though I was never bored with Apotheon, I felt the game shouldn't go on much longer. All in all, I'm positively surprised by this 'simple platformer' and would certainly recommend it.			"

												Highly addictive game! The soundtrack and visuals are stunning! Voice acting is also well done. For an indie game, it has high production values. The combat (especially with ranged weapons) takes some time to get used to but I think is unique and sets the game apart from other games in its genre. Boss battles are definitely one of the highlights of Apotheon!The freedom to explore every nook and cranny is phenomenal, you can go from emptying houses of valuables to diving to sunken ruins for treasures. Plus there are many ""hidden"" and optional objectives well worth investigating.Last but not least, Apotheon makes exceptional use of ancient Greece mythology and history and stays true to the Olympian gods' portfolios and their supposed disposition towards humanity.

												This is twice now that Alientrap has tricked me with a promising game spoiled by bizarre, floaty combat. Capsized was a beautiful little odyssey on a hostile alien world, but the enormous cluster♥♥♥♥ that battles inevitably became in every level turned me away. The saving grace of Apotheon is that there's a lot more going on than awkward swordfights, enough to keep me invested and poking through the ruins of antiquity. It's a testement, in fact, to how interesting the world and its secrets are that I can continue to put up with this awful flailing to see it.The Greek pantheon has turned their back on the mortal world (as they so often do in games), and you just happen to be the lucky stiff who gets to sort them out. With the aid of Hera you travel to Olympus to steal back the divine powers that keep Earth spinning and hospitable, but don't expect the gods to take this lightly. You'll need plenty of weapons, armor, potions, and gizmos to survive in their domains and overcome the unique challenges each god presents.Apotheon carves out an interesting niche where games like Zelda II and (funny enough) Journey to Olympus existed so long ago. It's not a metroidvania, but rather a side-scrolling adventure with a whole world to explore as you gain the power and resources to explore it. Olympus serves as a hub for shops and services to spend the gold you find, and then depart into the realm of the next god on your hit list. Major story beats open up new sections of Olympus and new deities to challenge, and there's an appropriately epic tale to carry you along.You may be surprised at the variety of environments you face when you seek out the power of a god. Each realm is cleverly designed to represent their patron and also provide an experience unique from the others. In the forest of Artemis you'll find wild animals to hunt and neutral hunters to compete with. Hades is a land of darkness and lost souls that constantly hound you. And Apollo's realm is a lavish palace that you'll take a very unexpected route through. Each of these areas includes tons of secret rooms and stashes to uncover, as well as unique secrets like special NPCs to meet or legendary vaults to raid.Most realms will have you turning to combat at some point or another, and this is where the game stumbles almost as hard as its goofy combatants. Apotheon takes a stab at 2D tactical melee combat, complete with facing, blocking, locational damage, and stamina. There's even rolling if the comparisons to Dark Souls haven't already made themselves. However, this is all taking place in a realm of platforming where you and your opponents can run like Sonic and leap three times their own height. If combat were somehow slowed and grounded (or even just had player collision) it would work as intended but what you end up with is an insane gaggle of bounding, stabbing bodies flailing at each other until you get enough lucky hits off. Even one-on-one duels devolve into leaping and swiping and missing like spastic, jousting field mice.As bad as the combat is, strangely enough the boss battles almost make up for it in how creative and challenging they are. Not every realm ends with a boss battle but the ones that do have themes just as creative and diverse as the realm itself. Your quest to overcome each god is incredibly faithful to historical legend, with hunts and epic voyages and deception pulled straight from epic poetry. There are labyrinths to escape, seas to sail, and pitched battles between dozens of soldiers, each adhering perfectly to the myths surrounding the deity they fall under. And it's worth mentioning that the ending is spectacular, both in spectacle and stakes.The further I got into Apotheon the more I found myself drawn into its clever world, and not just for the brilliance of the realms. There's a wealth of items and secrets to discover, owing to the transitive nature of the gear you'll use. Your weapons all have durability and break once it runs out with no recourse, so you'll need to constantly be collecting new ones scattered liberally around the world. There are dozens of potions, bombs, and gadgets to help you as well, either found or crafted using easily-gathered materials. You can upgrade your armor and your weapon skills permanently for gold, so accumulating wealth is another driver in the quest for secrets. And then there are legendary items like burning blades and radiant shields to recover and make use of.All this happens in a world that's surprisingly open to how you want to approach it. Hub areas have locked doors and guarded treasures to explore if you choose to challenge the guards. Unique keys and clues access side quests and hidden relics throughout the realms. There are breakable walls, secret switches, and special characters to find as well. By the end I felt like Apotheon had more fascinating secrets than most proper metroidvanias, and my curiosity still has not abated. There's so much to compliment about the game without even touching the incredible art style or sound design that the shoddy, floaty combat seems almost an afterthought. Not many games nail the feel of epic mythology like Apotheon, and fewer still build such a quality game on it.			"

												Apotheon is a 2D action platformer with some (elementary) puzzle, adventure/exploration and RPG elements. It is set in an ancient Greek-like world. Visuals/Graphics: Fantastic concept art, the strongest aspect of the game, hands down. Audio: Music is beautiful, SFX are good and the voice-over is very good as well. Gameplay: Combat is fine but I believe that there's room for improvement. The physics engine is a bit ""floating"", for an action platformer game. Story: Quite predictable, with some twists, but good overall. Of note is its very ""correct"" treatment of the mythology it draws from. Well done!I played the game with mouse+keyboard, on normal difficulty (the lowest), and it took me ~18hrs to complete the game and get all the exploration-related achievements. I don't see me replaying it, unless it gets an important update or a DLC etc. I especially enjoyed the design and challenge offered by the boss fights, which was always tailored to the mythology/lore in question. The game played smoothly and I encountered no serious bugs nor crashes. My only gameplay-related concern was that the physics engine sometimes felt weird, with the hero getting ""rag-dolled"" when hit by enemies; I can't exactly describe it, but sprites didn't feel as ""robust"" as they should.In overall, I believe Alientrap made a huge step forward with Apotheon, compared to their previous game, Capsized. I recommend this game.			"

												Apotheon is a 2D game about Greek mythology. Apotheon means “exalted to the state of godhood.” The Ancient Greek gods that we know from Greek mythology and their powers are on display in this game. The storytelling feels quite accurate and would make anyone with knowledge of Greek mythology feel welcome to play this game from the beginning.The protagonist is Nikandreos. Nikandreos means “victory of a man.” Combine Apotheon with Nikandreos and you can imagine what direction the story of this game will be taking. As Nikandreos you will traverse the map ascending to Mount Olympus and be asked to topple Zeus, the father of the gods. The art direction is quite impressive for a 2D game, which includes patterns, shapes, and figures known to be found on Greek pottery. There are diverse weapons and armor that appropriately reflect Ancient Greece. The weapons and armor tend to wear out from use, so you must find or buy new weapons and armor. This is when marketplaces such as Agora and Acropolis come into play. Agora and Acropolis are marketplaces that include weapon merchants, armor merchants, and black market merchants are selling their items. Black market merchants sell the rare weapons, weapons you will find that have unique properties.There is a world map and a local map, both of which will make it very difficult to get lost. The objectives are always well laid out and do not have to be complete in any order. There are Olympian guards in the various towns who will fight you if you try to pick any locks. There is a lot of freedom to move around from town to town. You can try to fight specific gods or goddesses, but you can spend time exploring areas for lockboxes that contain valuable weapons, armor, lockpicks, and potions. You can also complete side quests for other gods and goddesses to gain other powers.I had read from some players that the combat mechanics were clunky. It took me some time to get used to the controls for combat, but the learning curve is not too steep. I used the keyboard/mouse control and I managed to play to the end of the story. The biggest problem that I had with the keyboard/mouse scheme was when I faced three or more enemies at once. This is when your rolling ability is put to the test. Rolling and jumping are the key to winning battles against any enemies, including Olympian guards and gods or goddesses. There is the feeling of using proper tactics against different types of enemies. Simply mashing your buttons will not consistently help you win battles. Every battle, great or small will require tactics to minimize health damage and for victory.It feels disappointing when you lose weapons and shields due to wear and tear, but there will always be new weapons and shields available to replace the old ones without having to pay too much in coins. There are also enough nectar potions and repair kits to help with your health and armor. There are a few difficulty levels such as Warrior, Champion, and Olympian. Olympian is unlocked only after beating the game once. Olympian will not allow Nikandreos to regenerate health after the health is extremely low.As entertaining as this Greek themed game is, it feels like it could have used a little more polish. There were times when I received an error message when trying to reload a save game. It was not much of a big deal, but a more polished Apotheon would have prevented the error message from happening. There was also an apparent bug at the Refuge of Athena, a place where Athena challenges Nikandreos to find keys in a labyrinth. Saving the game where the platforms are always moving then reloading the game caused me to fall to my death every time. I realized that I had to save the game at the beginning where the platform is not moving at all. I believe that a more polished game would have led to a more accurate and less awkward combat system.There is a multiplayer feature for Apotheon, but there is not option to play with the mouse/keyboard scheme. It requires two controllers, which I found strange. There is co-op play, which was included in a recent patch. However, I think that the crux of this game is single player.I found Apotheon to be a decent game with excellent art direction, interesting story, and satisfying gameplay. I firmly believe that with a little more polish this game would have been a classic one. I still recommend this game to anyone, including those with lots of knowledge of Greek mythology and those with casual knowledge of Greek mythology.My Score: 7/10				"

												Apotheon is an astonishing game in its own way but also depends on a single requirement to you appreciate the same:- Have an appreciation for Greek/Hellenism mythology and culture.Art:An impressive detailing in matters related to  Hellenistic culture and myths of the same, the developers took that to heart of this game, as you clearly notice since the design of a catchy 2D world that pass itself entirely in an ancient Greece pottery, the game wants in a way  to make you see how, in your own eyes, how this civilization, thousands of years ago, saw their own history, education, society and religion, one of the few ways of communication they ever had at disposal, to pass knowledge and learning, just like we have google and digital libraries nowadays to do this kind of work  and they were strictly loyal to that matter. For example: If you goes to Hephaestus temple inside the game and take a close look to the representation the same outside ,you may notice Doric columns, that were usually dedicated to male gods, so the developers did their homework in that point. Gods like Poseidon or Apollo, since their own respective domains appear much more in the game set in comparison to Hephaestus may be better to notice this kind of level details.History:'Grand Theft Auto: Mount Olympus’.In resume you are Nikaendros Vercetti, the badass of Dion and have to show to the Olympus, who is the boss. (That also means to continue serious during your quest while have a drunk Satyr talking of your back at some point).Combat:Ever went  while a kid to a museum and for a while wondered those Hellenistic, thousands years old pottery images of heroes, their tales of great deeds at the side of the object , giving a small historical description and some information of the object and how they actually managed to triumph over almost impossible odds? This game delivers that quite a lot with a few of the boss fights, like the Cyclops and to manage hitting the same eye not just over that part but how remarkable accurate it is the animations over the vast Hellenistic arsenal you have at your disposal fighting other soldiers and mythological creatures.----------------------- Positive------------------------------------------------Art style.-Faithful game background with Hellenistic world that includes combat style, music and amazing atmosphere.-Huge variety of weapons, potions, armor all delivered straight from ancient Greece offering an extremely versatile combat system, kill in the way you want and be happy with your own pottery carnage.-Easy and simple craft system.-Funny dialogs in their own way across several moments over the game.-Astonishing and rewarding exploration, the game really takes your curiosity to explore every corner of the map you are set and prove to not let you down most of the time while finding hidden treasures, notes or keys to even more secrets.---------------------------Negative-------------------------------------------- It may feel repetitive at some points with combat but nothing that you can’t make up with different weapons setup for a change.-  Mechanics itself may feel a bit the lack of polish and wonky sometimes.----------------------------------------Overall--------------------------------There are games out there we say that is more than just for fun but also a piece of art, Apotheon is a clear example of this, a precious hidden jewel,10/10 would definitely goes into pottery graffiti again!

												Very fun and engaging gameplay, excellent art and music, a pretty long single player campaign with much variety in the levels, enemies and boss fights. You get to visit the deities of Olympus, align with some, fight others or beat them in their challenge in a story that is faithful and respectful to elements of the greek mythology. You will find many weapons, fight lots of enemies and mythic monsters while seeking to complete your quest. And there are also lots of side objectives and secrets to discover.Highly recommended!			"

												Overall, this felt a little shallow to me.  The plot was pretty thin (gods have abandoned humanity, so go kill them all), the combat was floaty and imprecise, and the level design is sprawling and a bit directionless.  I found myself mindlessly following the objective arrows, usually running straight past enemies that I couldn't be bothered engaging with (and didn't need to, as they're so slow).I gave it a few hours, but it didn't seem to be getting any better so I dropped it after a few bosses.On the plus side, the art style looks great, the music fits nicely, and the voice acting is fairly good.  But ultimately, it didn't engage me.			"

												I have finished the game, and let me tell you, I really liked it. This game is the epitome of an indie quality product. The amount of inmertion thanks to the background music and, of course, the outstanding artstyle, makes this a game worth trying. I took 10 hours, wich for the price of this game, is pretty fair. Also, I haven't done all of the game's ""sidequests"", so I still have more to do.Something important that I didn't expect from this game (because it isn't stated anywhere in the store page) was the fact that it's open world, therefore, those ""sidequests"" exists. Altough some are just are kind of dull, they give a change of pace to the game if the player ever wishes for one. But either way, the game changes the pace by itself. For example, getting to Athena is very diferent from getting to Poseidon. And in a related topic, let me tell you, I was surprised by the amount of creativity that the boss fights have+Pros1.-THE ARTSTYLE. You can see that the artstyle is not only unique, but well crafted and incredible. It's what convinced me to buy the game, and I wasn't dissapointed. You really feel like you are one big piece of ancient art, and it's amazing.2.-Greek mythology. Many games think that just because God of war succeeded with Greek mythology, it's easy to abuse it. That has been proven wrong. But in this case, they nailed it perfectly.3.-The controls. They are very responsive, and once you get a hold of the weapons, you find your own fighting style naturally. 4.-Level design. Once you finish the first level (which works as a good, non-boring tutorial) they give you a bit of freedom to do as you please (but thread carefully). In the levels themselves, the enemies feel in place, and the moments without combat generally serve a purpose, and last just long enough.5.-Boss fights. If you are like me, and like a good, creative, brutal and old-fashioned fight against amighty, fearsome and satisfying enemy, then this is the game for you. The classic feeling stays there even with the large amount of creativity that most boss fights have. Rarely are two boss fight the same, or even simlar, which is impresive.6.-Pace of the game. The ""tutorial"" is fun, and gives a good taste of what's to come. The difficulty curve is very smooth (unless you try to go too crazy and go, for example, to Hades before Apollo, you may have a bit of trouble). And as I said before, every boss is different, and also the common enemies tend to vary, so you must change strategies from time to time. This prevents the game for getting tedious at all times.-Cons1.-Hitboxes. Sometimes you are sure you hit somebody (or that you got hit) but nothing happens. If youlike close combat, you may find a strange and maybe awkward combat situation now and then. And this is way more common that it should. Most times it is actually funny, but when the game gets harder, it might end in a frustrating moment.2.- Map design. It's not bad by any means, just that sometimes is a little too simple, and relies on changing ""areas"" to keep the flow of the game. The again, the inmersion of the game makes it hard to noctice sometimes.Veredict:9/10 Highly recomended.A fine piece of an indie game at a low price, with an artstyle that has never been seen. The fun factor is always present in this enjoyable experience.			"

												This is the first game I've played in as long as I can remember where I kept playing after I finished the main story just to collect all the items, do all the sidequests, and explore the world. Having the entire game look like the artwork on an ancient greek urn was an inspired decision and it really payed off. Just walking through the different areas and looking at all the statues and characters and enviroments is a lot of fun, and that's a big part of what made me want to keep playing.The combat takes some getting used to but can also be a lot of fun. I think a big part of what makes it difficult at first is that a lot of weapons have a long wind up time before the strike, whereas in most platformers the strike happens almost instantenously. I can see why some people don't like this but to me it made it feel like the attacks have real force behind them which makes landing a blow a lot more satisfying. The other unusual part of combat is that you aim your attacks with the mouse. This probably adds more depth for players who want to really dig into the system and develop their skills, but to me it often felt overcomplicated. However, if you play with a controller your attacks will automatically go in the direction your charcter is facing, so that was a good solution for me. You can still aim your attacks with the right stick if you need to.The story is interesting if you are interested in Ancient Greek literature and mythology. They did a good job portraying all the gods and had some interesting takes on their characters. A touch I really liked is the signposts around the game with quotes from Homer and other Greek authors about the parts of Greek mythology you're currently playing through. One problem I have with the story (and this is a pet peeve of mine that happens in a lot of stories like this) is that the characters all speak in that weird, formal, pseudo-Shakespearian register. It doesn't make sense to do this just because this is set in an old time period. These characters are not English people from 400 years ago, they're based on Greek people from 2,000 years ago. It would have been cool if the writing was more like Stanley Lombardo's translation of Homer, which uses mostly modern language but still sounds appropriately epic.Despite a few drawbacks though, I highly recommend this game. Its a fun and engaging platformer with a good story and a unique and beautiful artstyle.			"

												When I bought this game I wasn't expecting it to be so good. Even if you aren't really into these kinds of games, Apotheon is definitely one to try out. The story is interesting and the trials are engaging. The characters are great and I was sad to see the game end. I was never taught about Greek mythology in school, so I was very interested in reading the different plaques which gave information on the different gods and goddesses.The gameplay is engaging and the different upgrades and weapons keep the game changing in a way that makes you feel supreme when you visit a previous area with advanced weapons, but still challenging in current stage bosses. Speaking of which, not all boss moments are fights. Some are tests, some are puzzels, and some are games (in the case of Dionysus, a drinking game!). Although the fights are slightly challenging on Warrior difficulty, I suggest playing the game on Champion for the full experience. The directional combat may get a bit annoying from time to time when Nikandreos swings with a mind of his own, but it's still fun!Of all the aspects of the game, the artwork is probably the best. And I'm not just talking about the nudity!. The art style, and the illusion that the whole game is painted on a stone wall, give the game a very epic (meaning story/legend) feeling and a very epic (meaning awesome/cool) look.I really had fun playing this game and, as it is now nearlly 6 am (after being up all night playing this) and I have a lecture at 10, I am going to need to wrap this up. Overall a really good game and definitely worth getting. It is worth more than the price paid for it. Trust me. I'm just some guy you met on the internet!9.5/10			"

												This game is one of those games that you find, you start up, and you instantly know it will be awesome. Apotheon has a stunning art style, mimicking ancient Greek art perfectly. The story is not the most creative thing but the mission layout is really well made - each zone has tons of variety and there are always multiple ways to conquer them. And the boss fights - don't get me started on those. Each is unique requiring skill and strategy to beat and they have they're own little mechanics to them as well which can make for a nice change. It has some basic platforming elements which admittedly can be tedious, and usually involve jumping, climbing, jumping, climbing and more jumping - followed by climbing - but the rage boiling inside me is let free when I get to massacre a group of enemies at the next area.The combat is reliant on player skill, not character skill, and you constantly need to be switching back and forth between your doru and your xiphos and rolling behind your enemies and lobbing jars of greek fire at them. Despite this, there is a nice system of character progression, and you can upgrade armour, purchase skills etc. Apotheon has basic stealth mechanics built in, and its nice to sneak into someones attic and steal their coins or shoot a satyr in the back from the shadows. I did find myself lost and the map can be confusing. Unfortunately, a lot of time is spent figuring out where to go, but the reward makes up for the painstaking navigation. All in all, despite its flaws, this is a beautiful game that deserves your money. Go get this. NOW. 9/10.			"

												It's been a while since I wrote a review, but I find this game deserving of one. Since this is a story-driven experience:***SPOILER ALERT***Spoilers will be properly marked with tags such as this: Spoiler text read them at your own risk.With that out of the way, let's begin.This 2D sidescroller brawler/platformer is in my opinion a strong contender for best game of 2015 (as of the time of this review, at least). It does pretty much everything right.The first and most noticeable aspect of the game is obviously its art style, which is based on ancient greece pottery painting and links nicely with gameplay elements: enemies units have red markings on them so you can identify them right away, for instance. Nice choice of color for the backgrounds and effects (foam, blood, smoke and so on) and excellent music as well.Gameplay feels very complete and fun: Your character can walk, jump, swim, climb certain slopes (and even the ceiling in a few cases), roll, block with a shield and wield a variety of ranged and melee weapons with their own unique properties. There is some enemy variety, but it isn't the main point here: combat is. While simple, it allows you to perform a variety of attacks, depending on the weapon such as throwing projectiles, upper and lower slashes and thrusts. It is essential to know these in order to attack enemies, specially ones carrying shields. It has some degree of realism to it. For instance, the slow, but long Sarissa will only hurt enemies that are at the tip of the spear just like in real life and that can take some getting used to (althought it is well worth it once you do get used to it). In short, it feels satisfying and controls very well (I used an XBOX 360 controller).Combat also includes several boss battles and this is where the game really shines: This game probably has the most creative set of boss battles I have ever seen. The Olympian Gods you face are not limited to simple brawls: The boss battles really go hand-in-hand with their unique personalities. Good examples are Artemis' Hunt, Hipparchos' horseback battle and  Poseidon rocking your boat .Platforming sections are also well made and creative with sections such as Athena's Maze being one of the most brilliant pieces of level design I've played through in a good while (again, going hand in hand with the Gods' personality).Gameplay also includes certain metroidvania elements such as the big overworld with several subsections, but don't expect a whole lot of hidden secrets and any form of item progression (I.E. this item allows you to access this area which gets you a new item for a new area and so on) here. It has a simpler approach, as the focus of the game is the combat. A small market and extremely simple (I mean it in a good way) crafting system provide a small degree of RPG elements to the experience, giving you some choice regarding the direction you wanna take your character in without feeling complex to the point that it detracts from the action. Like I said before, just right.The story is pretty much what you'd expect from Greek Mythology:***SPOILER ALERT AGAIN***Arrogant, capricious Gods, stern heroes, the strength of men, clashes for power, betrayal, vengeance and lots of blood.The ending moments genuinely surprised me (in a pleasant way, actually), but this is probably because I was sure it was gonna go down a certain way (and it didn't). Again, a mention to the boss battles being able to truly deliver a perfect and satisfying experience that's fitting with what's going on, story-wise. Speaking of the campaign, the game lasts just the right amount of time without feeling too short like a sudden ending and without dragging on to the point of becoming boring and causing the player to go ""ugh, get to the point already!"". Again, just right.All of that I said above refers to the campaign mode: There is also a fun duel minigame that can be played locally with a friend and an online mode which I can't comment on here, because I couldn't find games as of this time (Then again, I haven't really tried and it's still in beta, so some problems are to be expected).Anything bad I could say about the game would be nitpicking and would not harm the overall experience in any way (the only thing I can think of right now is how slopes slow you down as you're getting momentum to start running... feels just a bit frustrating. A very minor complaint indeed.)So this is my long review for this game: A fun, satisfying experience that integrates gameplay, story and art perfectly, featuring fun and interesting characters and brutal, bloody 2D action.Buy it!

												I've played it here and there throughout its alpha and beta and continue to be really engaged by the aesthetic and controls. Though you can certainly button mash to get the job done, I appreciated that an effort has been put in to give finesse and skill to the melee combat system. The combat depends on timing and knowing your weapons, which you figure out intuitively by using them. Switching between weapons to equip ones you already have, picking up weapons from defeated enemies and throwing whatever weapon youre holding either in desperation or for that tactical final blow, all work seamlessly as you fight your way through the world.  The dialogue, voice acting and story is unobtrusive or engaging, depending on whether you care for such things (I rather do). The art style is consistent and striking. The music is foreboding. All in all a well crafted game.			"

												It's sure to capture the attention of anyone who sees it in action. Thankfully, the game more than backs up its aesthetic prowess with rewarding combat and exploration systems in place. While the combat hardly changes over the course of the adventure, Apotheon asks the player to apply their knowledge in such a wide variety of ways that it constantly feels fresh and exciting. The ancient Greeks valued balance and harmony in their art, and Alientrap has accomplished just that.http://www.destructoid.com/review-apotheon-287100.phtml "

												Overall I like the main idea of the game. This game is based - Greek. Art style of this game is amazing and really incredible, counting I'm an artist and wannabe' future designer.Same on its own, Greek culture and art, is very interesting and likeable.I love Greek Culture myself, and this makes it even more thrusting.Apotheon is an awesome, I could say, Greek game, in which you play as a Warrior/Fighter, Nikandreos, who lands to find Dion in more ruin then before, with the wrath of the Gods now extending to physical aggression on Earth.People with difficulties through combat, sligh' issues with speed of the game, and FPS, ... That's agreed by me.The game's fighting experience is kind-of too fast, but its perfect in the same time. The FPS issue, not much people have it, as it is, depends on your internet speed/memory or your computer. As im experiencing FPS Issues, to my belief, I know its my Computer itself.I hope this review helped you with the decision of what'd you want to do 'with the game' or what didn't you?Rate: 10.6/10			"

YouTube™ Video: Apotheon: Intro 

			Views: 20		

			The epic journey begins… http://www.apotheongame.com/		

I preordered Apotheon back in May, 2014 for $9.99 and got the game few days before released, as soon as I saw the trailer, I was instantly hooked and pretty satisfied when first playing it.This is the best adventure game I've ever played, even though it's in 2D, the ancient Greek art style is just stunning and I don't think there's any 3D games could deliever this kind of atmosphere.Although sometimes frame rate would drop a bit, there's lots of stuff going on in the background, fire, running civs, enimies and allies fighting etc.Apotheon combines RPG elements with a variety of weapons(all are throwable to attack), shields, training to be more powerful, upgrading your armors, crafting system for potions, traps, and allies(wolf, hawks, undeath... and more).The game also contains rich Greek Mythology, very interesting to learn about the Gods you're fighting with.Apotheon comes with local multiplayer with 1 v 1 death match; online multiplayer hasn't in it yet, but according to developers, it's a possible feature.The story is full of length with lots of stages, side quests, secret passages and maps.To me it worths every penny so I definitely recommend this game!

Posted: June 22, 2016
												Recently I've been looking for less graphics-intensive games to play on my mac laptop.  I wanted something fun with cool artwork that would look pretty on my retina display and this game knocks it out of the park. The ancient Greek style artwork is really cool and well done, while the gameplay is exciting and addicting. I really did not expect to like games such as this (2D, platforming, sidescroller) because I mainly game on my desktop and play all of the huge, popular RPG's and action adventure games. But I'm really glad I gave this a shot so that I can game on my laptop when not at home. Apotheon is great and I look forward to playing more games like it.**Update post completion of gameIn my initial review I focused mainly on the pretty graphics and artwork and the fact that I could play this on my macbook, which in my opinion is not intended for gaming. Now that I have finished the game, I thought it warranted a second review of the gameplay and story.As stated before, this game exceeded expectations. The gameplay, while simple, is subtly complex in ways that I did not realize until I was further into story. My favorite thing about this game is that it has many of the classic action-rpg elements, albeit a slightly simplified version. There are a variety of weapons to find/use, including ""special"" weapons for which you must complete side quests that are not obligatory in the main story. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the game encourages the use of all weapons and items in order to overcome different enemies. Sometimes I found using a spear the best option as it gave me range when fighting multiple enemies, while other times I used swords or hammers for speed or damage. Sometimes, I would lay traps while luring enemies to their doom. Furthermore, all weapon damage can be upgraded using gold at weapon trainers in markets. Armor upgrades come with increased defense, as well as cosmetic changes. When I found the Strategos helm, a large Spartan type helmet, I was elated. You are also able to craft various items and use them to different effects. These range from a simple health potion or firebomb to summoning animals and the undead to fight alongside you. Finally, the movement in this game takes a little getting used to, but once comfortable is very fun. I found out late in the game that in the air you can press the dodge/roll button to do a front or backflip that came in very useful for avoiding projectiles and accessing hard-to-reach places.As for the story I was pleasantly surprised. As far as plot, it is nothing new or unique but is still very well done. Whenever I beat bosses (typically greek gods) I felt a sense of badass-ness, and the final boss fight was as epic as I expected it to be from a mythic Greek hero story. I found the voice acting surprisingly good, which always elevates the story and game for me. Add in the beautiful art style and I was pretty impressed. For a 2D sidescroller that I picked up for 15 bucks, this game was more complex and fun than I thought it would be. It provided me with 20+ hours of gaming, and a very fun experience. I highly recommend it whether you just want something to play on your non-gaming laptop or high-performance gaming rig.			"

												BUY THIS GAME 10/10A long wait for this game but so far I'm very impressed. I've also edited down below where I talk a little about the controls. Where to start?-Level design: big sprawling levels, with various ""missions"" to complete in each one at your own pace and order. A good variety of different environments and I've barely seen anything yet. Also there is a good variety of missions too, the gameplay is not repetitive.-Weapons: Very large variety of different weapons. Melee weapons can be thrown and picked back up. Arrows and javelins can be retrieved as well. Really gives you a lot of options when fighting enemies. I even picked up a boulder and threw it on someones head crushing them. Each weapon breaks and discards after so much usage, but they last a good while before they break. And you find them all over, so you're never unarmed scrambling for a weapon to use. For weapons that you can only carry one of(like the sword), when you pick up a new one, it will discard the old one and not allow you to pick it up again. I like this feature because it's one less thing to manage or think about(Whether or not the sword you picked up was the same one that was about to break that you just dropped) I recommend use a weapon only good enough to beat the opponent in front of you, save the best weapons for the bosses.-Crafting: There is a crafting system, whereby you collect plants, fangs from dogs you kill, etc. And you also get recipes from characters throughout, some they will give you others you will have to buy. You craft healing potions, ""Greek Fire,"" bombs, powder to summon wolf companion, powder to summon Eagle companion to hunt for you. The crafting system is simple, easy to use, and yet there are so many good features it brings to the table(Like the wolf companion). I can't wait to see what else you can make.-Mythology: Stones are placed all over the world with quotes from Ancient Greek literature. They seem to be relevant to where you are in the world as well. By this I mean they inform the creatures and gods directly around you, so you never really feel lost if you are not a scholar in Greek Mythology. I'm learning and it's fun!-Various: Gameplay is great, controls are responsive. I've seen some reviews that think the controls are clunky, but this was not my impression. BTW I've only used a 360 controller. There is certainly a learning curve, but after an hour I had the hang of it though and never looked back. There is an endurance bar in bottom left that will drain if you button spam the melee weapon, and it will take you longer to swing slower. You really need to use your shields and time your strikes. Don't just rush in after a group of enemies, but rather strike from a distance, set up traps, and rush in when numbers are thinned.  Really creative and unique boss fights(like Artemis, Apollo, you'll see). Voice acting, music, and sound effects are great. There is even some humor in the game(the satyrs made me laugh).These are just some of the key points I wanted to highlight. I can only imagine the blood sweat and tears that went into making this. Alientrap did an amazing job. I don't want to say anything definitive about any game before I finish playing but this game has quickly become a favorite, leapfrogging hundreds of games in my backlog I've been meaning to play that will now have to wait even longer. I think we may have a masterpiece here.			"

												A fanstastic and fun to play 2D platform RPG with ancient greek pottery art theme. I spent about 9 hours to complete the game in ""Warrior"" difficulty (Including doing some sidequests).Pros:- Fantastic music.- Loads of different weapons with different stats.- Good voiceacting.- Exploring and pillaging.- Shops for improving skills and armor, and for buying potions and weapons.- Good variety of maps and enemies.- Excellent map system.Cons: - Awkward final boss.- Game crashed a couple of times, due to updates (I think).- Difficult to switch between the different weapons in battles.- Lot's of small details you can find irritating.

												This game is actually very refreshing. It's a platforming hack-n-slash that requires well-timed blocks and a good eye for where to swing. You do navigate obstacles, but the game focuses more on combat. You're often put into situations where you need to juggle between fighting at range and up close. Enemies demand that you overcome their strengths and exploit their weaknesses. The AI is pretty decent, it will strike at you if you leave yourself open, wait for you to drop your guard, and even dodge projecticles if you hurl them wildly. There is a progession system, you upgrade your armor, buy new weapons (which degreade and break after use), upgrade your damage/attack speed with certain weapon types, and purchase recipies for brewing potions (health and buffs mostly). There's a surprising amount of weaponry for an indie game, over a dozen choices. The story is interesting, and while it's not what drives me to play it, I'm definitely interested when the NPCs begin their dialogue. The atmosphere, music, and art are absolutely fantastic; the game does an amazing job aesthetically. The art style is what attracted me to it, but I can say I genuinely ended up enjoying the game; i'd give it a solid 8/10.			"

												An incredible 2D-Platformer with a glitchy but funny combat system.Pros: The graphic style. Greek art at it's finest A really good and driving soundtrack Small but good and well thought crafting system Greek mythology! Great gameplay Free savesCons:  The Combat System can be a bit difficult to master, especially when you are dealing with multiple enemies and must quickly switch between melee combat and archery / granades.  The inventory system is quite hard to manage. Switching between weapons in combat can be really hard. Boss battles are a bit too easyConclusion:As a big fan of Castlevania / Metroid games and the likes i really enjoyed this one.I recommend a controller for this game!This game is highly recommended for everyone who likes ""Metroidvania"" games.

An indie title which seamlessly melds the platforming and RPG genres, and does so without pretense or haughtiness. Apotheon will have the player tackle the twelve Olympians, endeavours culminating in the apotheosis of our Champion. Jump your way through complex 2D levels and collect a myriad of weapons in the realms of the Gods. Solve puzzles in the underworld while escaping from the fires of wrathful Phlegethon. Battle the Gods themselves in some classic boss encounters.Overall, the complexity of mythological narrative coupled by all-too-familiar platforming mechanics make a wonderful addition to the plethora of ""Indie"" titles released daily.

												Learning isn’t really a popular theme for video games these days it seems. I find that a real shame, as there is not much that can be more immersive than a well-made video game. Being dropped into the middle of a strange culture, and absorbing every aspect of it is supremely satisfying for both spirit and mind. As someone who knows quite a bit about Greek mythology, it’s quite obvious that the team over at Alientrap has done their homework as well. The weapons are all standard fare for the time, and can each serve a different purpose. There are ranged and melee weapons, but in a pinch your can throw your melee weapon with the middle mouse button. Just try not to break them all before you find a replacement. The durability on weapons adds greatly to the survival aspect of this game, but is really only the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot here to be excited about, so let’s get into it and take a deeper look at Apotheon.The story revolves around a Greek warrior named Nikandreos, who has been sent by the goddess Hera to kill her god-husband Zeus as punishment for abandoning the people of Greece. Along the way you will fight Zeus’ brothers, daughters, and sons. As you defeat them, you will be powered up. Artemis’ Bow will allow you to fire arrows faster, Apollo’s Lyre will illuminate the dark so a torch isn’t a complete necessity. Before you fight the gods, you will need to complete objectives within their realm. These usually consist of “find this” but some are a bit more thought out. Stealthing around a Satyr party to smash all their wine and make them leave is bliss. Make good use of your Assassin’s Dagger, which does 600% damage from behind. It might also be a good idea to craft some stealth potions… Or you can craft a bunch of explosives and healing salves, and just go Rambo on them. The choice is yours, and adds quite a lot to the replayability.On top of using a different loadout of weapons, there is also an advanced difficulty mode. Enemies have more health, swing faster, and hit harder… I wouldn’t recommend it to start with due to the quick nature of the combat. The aesthetic in the game really captured me, it is all based on the Greek art commonly seen on all manner of decor of the time. When the game goes extremely dark, you might notice that the dark nothingness appears to be made of stone. Major kudos to the guy who thought that one up. I just wish the music was able to keep pace with the graphics, but unfortunately, to me it falls a bit short. It’s not that the music breaks the mood, or isn’t enjoyable. I just found that the songs didn’t really stick with me. Still, the multitude of creatures and heroes and gods that you meet along your path towards bloody revenge would be enough for me to want to complete the story, even if there were no music at all.There is very little criticism I was able to find in Apotheon. Some of the hitboxes are wonky, which can lead to a comical mid-combat moment of both characters flailing their weapons wildly and hitting nothing but air. The music is also a bit bland, as I stated previously. Overall though, I love everything Apotheon has to offer. The endless struggle to find a useable weapon and shield, the crafting of potions capable of amazing feats, and the terrific speed of the running and combat. The entire game feels very fluid, and comes together to form an experience that I’ve never had before and doubt I ever will again. While you won’t be able to write an essay on the rise and fall of Greece, Apotheon is a great game to brush up on your mythology. Or you can just enjoy it for the experience it is, which is great. But I think the tidbits posted add a great deal. Who doesn’t want to read a little passage about Apollo? And once you’re done learning about him, you can murder him! Huge thanks to the folks at Alientrap for developing something that is so much fun, and even slightly edifying.Summary: Greek action-adventure peppered with survival elements and lessons on mythology.Final Score: 8/10 for aesthetic, story, replayability, and education.Full text/photos: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-apotheon/Video review:

												Apotheon is an action adventure that even casual fans of Greek mythology can appreciate. I’ve always had a relatively cursory interest in Greek mythology. The plays and stories are important for literature because they are the stories we continue to tell. I could easily get lost in the family trees and names, but I love the stories that I can remember, and that’s more than enough to appreciate Apotheon’s setting. The black-figure pottery art style is delightful and timeless. It translates the action and feel of the game incredibly well. It effortlessly brings to life all the classic mythos and godly figures of Greece. The music pairs together nicely, but the visuals steal the show. While other games can plunge further down into the uncanny valley, Apotheon can relax comfortably in its mountainside estate.The main plot is that Zeus is having a bad week and tells all of his many children/inbreeds to stop blessing mortals with their gifts which include just about everything they need to survive. Hera enlists our protagonist Nikandreos to fight the Gods of Olympus. The story is predictable in its major points, but I suppose that’s just how classic tales go. The game really shines in its attention to mythos, or so I have heard from those more versed than I. The pacing of the game works in the narrative’s favor as I never found myself listless: I was either enjoying the ride I was on or I was hopping on for another to hunt down secrets and side quests.The gameplay all around is really enjoyable. The game has a good sense of adventure, and Apotheon is willing to commit to the feel of the various areas and scenarios, which makes them all the more satisfying. Having to find a buried treasure sans waypoint, fighting a master huntress as both predator and prey, traversing a spinning labyrinth to lead a small squad against the goddess of wisdom are just some of the many great moments of the game. While it may average around a dozen hours for some, those dozen hours feel expertly designed. Almost every new area I went to felt like an enjoyable spinoff of what was already a fun game, and that’s what makes Apotheon so engrossing: the boss fights and various areas are constructed so well that they can stand on their own but easily fit into the rest of the game.With all the praise out of the way, it’s time to strain out some of the weaker points. While the situations that the game throws you feel fantastic, the game itself does not really grow. You get some new abilities, but otherwise your armor increases and weapons feel the same. There is not much to tweak around with apart from special weapons, there are not skill points and the like. This game keeps the mechanics simple and then surrounds the player in exciting scenarios. Along with this, the main narrative takes a backseat against the different deities the game showcases, which can be a downer for some. The game is not stuck-to-the-rails linear to where you just move forward through set pieces, but rather the player is free to explore the game. These are rather small details that I would not call negatives, but notable qualities.While players should not go in expecting the visceral, veiny phallus of vengeance that is God of War, Apotheon is a delightful action adventure.

												I have never felt the need to write a review on Steam, but this game deserves one.Where do I start...Apotheon is a side-scrolling action & platforming game. The story in short, something is wrong/corrupt on Mount Olympus, and now you have to whoop some a** to find out why. It is much more in-depth than this, but I do not want to spoil anything. If you like reading, there are also several ""vases"" scattered around the world to really flesh out the story and even educate you on some of the myths.Do you remember studying Ancient Greece Mythology? Remember those finely crafted vases? What about the Disney movie, Hercules? Remember when they had segways and story-telling on the side of a vase? That's the art style of this game. In fact, the gameplay is as such as well. The animations completely capture the feel of those vases. It almost feels clunky at times... a good clunky... a clunky that makes sense in this art style. If this is turning you away, don't let it - it needed to feel this way if you ask me. Plus, the enemies experience this as well.After 10 minutes, you'll realize that this is probably one of the most highest quality Castle/Metroidvania that has come out in a long, long time. You find weapons, buy weapons, pick up weapons off the dead bodies of your opposers. These weapons include: (Melee) Sword, Clubs, Spears, Hammers, Shields (Projectiles) Arrows - many different kinds of them, Javelins, Bombs, and Greek fire. Armor is upgradable. You get special powers from defeating bosses.  There are probably tons more as well, I'm only about 2-3 hours in right now so I have a lot more to see.The game also covers many popular mechanics of today as well. Like crafting? It's in the game, and it's actually useful. They didn't complicate this game with recipes that require TOO MUCH reagents. Want to make a bomb? You only need 2 items. Potion? 2 items. Not a fan of potions or bombs? You can make traps. Hate traps? You can summon companion ravens and wolves. Hate companions? WHO COULD HATE A COMPANION WOLF?Anyhow, I think I'm done writing this review now - because I want to play some more. I'll update this is I find anything else that NEEDS to be noted.TL;DR: Buy it.

												If you really mind good art directions this is totally your game. But the art is not the only big deal about this game, the fight system is lovely realism of the good ol' traditional weapons like blades, shields, bow and arrow, and bombs. But you have variety of weapons, javelins, blast arrows, knifes, tridents, etc. The game Has little details in the gameplay that make the game a lot more realistic, even though it haves a really ""not realistic"" aesthetic, and i think that's the eprfect combination.Totally worth the buy, it's so weird to see games with historical concepts, so it's really cool. Pretty much my first fav of 2015. I'm so picky with games i get frustrated because i don't want to play anything, then apotheon appeared <3.			"

Apotheon is one of many 2D platform games, but with its visual style, it creates an unique experience for all gamers to enjoy.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.Note: I played this game when I was on vacation with no internet so playtime and achievements were not registered for some reason. It was a nice vacation, though.What is happening in the game:Greek Gods have abandoned the humanity and it's up to you to fight against the gods, take their power and ensure the humanity to survive.Pros: It will be the first you'll notice and the best thing you'll notice: how the game looks. It's just like those ancient vases and amphorae that you see in museums. I never expected this style to fit this well into the game, but it really looks perfect. The combat mechanics are really enjoyable, you get to try a lot of different weapons like swords and spears (those really long ones). The music is really nice, it fits the environment well and kind of sets you to ancient times. Really nice. Another thing I did not expect in a game is the way it shows spoken text. It shows you the entire thing someone is going to say and it colours the letters as they are spoken, just like in karaoke. You can smash mostly anything you can come across, all the boxes, vases and stuff like that. They can sometimes include coins or other valuables, so it's a good idea to smash everything. There are not only weapons in this game, but it also has a pretty nice shield system. When you hold right click, a large shield pops up in from of you and you can direct it with your mouse. Unique and very useful. You get a lot of weapons and other things in game and this game manages your inventory extremely well. You can keep everything you pick up with no limits, but most of the things ""expire"" after you use them for some time. Linux and MacOS support. Just the way things should be.Cons: Combat system is great in my opinion, but it takes a bit of getting used to it before you master it. I know this is bothering to most people, so I'm listing it here. Sometimes, I feel like there are way to many things on the screen or at least the rich visuals give that feeling. It's not that bad, though.The final verdict:This game is awesome, no questions about it. The visual style itself is almost worth the price, but with the story and music, this is not a game you want to miss. I enjoyed it a lot (again, my playtime did not count, see the note at the top) and it definitely has replayability potential just because it feels so good when you play it. Take a look at the screenshots and you'll know what I'm talking about.I know 15$ is a lot to some people, but really, consider buying it or at least grab it when it's discounted. It's a really unique and charming experience.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Posted: November 23, 2016
												I first encountered Apotheon through an article on IGN, and was immediately surprised that a developer had been both bold and creative enough to craft a game with such a distinct look. I soon purchased it and began playing in the company of my partner who, like me, is fairly interested in the history of art. To begin with then we were both positively biased towards it simply because of the art direction, and for most of our playthrough that was enough to keep us somewhat engaged. However, after making it through the majority of the game, our opinions had both turned towards frustration, and we decided to abandon the playthrough.Needless to say, the presentational aspects of this game are top quality. It possesses a fantastically idiosyncratic visual aesthetic within the annals of gaming, and the animation imparts a sense of movement to the player-avatar and enemies that sits well within this aesthetic. Indeed, the game has a great sense of design unity between its gameplay, aesthetic and story elements that many games fail to achieve. What's more, the encroachment of cut-scenes and other non-interactive elements is pleasantly minimal.Having said that, there are a few essential areas of design that are so disappointing that I cannot wholeheartedly recommend Apotheon. Firstly, if you are going to play it, do not use a keyboard and mouse configuration, as it renders the otherwise interestingly designed combat mechanics infuriating to use at times. Unfortunately, I was stuck using such a configuration for the majority of the playthrough as I had no access to a console controller, but I grinned and bore it as I recognised that the developers recommend the use of a gamepad. As others have also pointed out, both combat and traversal can sometimes seem floaty, and occasionally movement will glitch in irritating ways, but these are far from the designers’ biggest failings.No, far less forgivable is the overall quality of game and level design. As a massive fan of Super Metroid, I expect certain standards to be met by Metroidvania titles. These include decent variety across level designs, a good degree of depth to exploration, and a reasonably high frequency of being surprised by what I encounter and uncover. Whereas other indie gems of recent years such as Cave Story, Guacamelee! and Axiom Verge triumphed in these regards, Apotheon severely lacks: level layouts are hugely uninspired and often seemed arbitrary; the breadth of discoverable items, treasure and upgrades is disappointingly limited; and there were next to no moments when I felt delighted, excited or impressed by a hidden/hard-to-find game element. By the time I reached the maelstrom of tedious traversal and bland level structuring that is the Poseidon portion of the game (no water-temple/IGN allusion intended), enough was enough. In other regards the game wasn’t quite so disappointing. The narrative is suitably light and no more superficial than what I’ve experienced to be the general standard of game writing. However, unlike the visuals, the story-based elements did seem to lack ‘soul’, but I'm not the sort to be bothered by such things as long as the gameplay is well designed. In regards to audio, I recall not being induced to fits of unintended laughter or rage by the dialogue or voice acting - which is always a pleasant surprise given examples elsewhere in the industry - and I remember being suitably impressed by the semiotic aptness of the music. Ultimately though, Apotheon lacks any great sense of charm or character outside of its aesthetic elements, and it doesn’t possess the level of game design polish or nuance its art direction seemingly suggests. The game is a triumph of visual style over gameplay substance, albeit in a way that differentiates it from AAA titles that could be described in the same way. Historically, it will likely become noteworthy for its experimentation with a unique visual design at a time when popular games were mostly polarized between pseudo-realistic hi-fidelity graphics and nostalgia-tugging pixel art. In the here-and-now though, if you're looking for something to scratch that 2D action-adventure game itch, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.			"

Posted: August 21, 2016
												I'm giving this game a positive review despite everything here being negative:8 hours in and I'm not sure how much more of the game I have left - and to be honest I just can't bring myself to finish this. After playing for about 20 minutes each session I just have to stop. I feel that the mechanics are not varied enough and I'm suffering from an epic Metroidvania travel fatigue. The levels are very large, and each God has their own area which requires a lot of back tracking. The distance between the objectives are lightly spattered by very similar human enemies with different weapons or animals trying to lunge at you. Once you have an optimal set of items, it's hard to move away from them. There are some standout moments, such as an interesting battle involving alternating between being hunter and prey, but other than that I'm not a fan. Having said that, why I'd recommend this game is that the art style is nice, the mechanics while I personally feel aren't varied enough, are pretty solid. And I think I'm a minority on the reasons why I find the game boring. Get it on a sale, give it a go. It's decent enough. Oh and everyone saying it's 2D God of War.. it's a stretch. Thematically definitely a borrowing heavily from Greek Mythology, but style and execution not quite there.			"

												This is one of these games you do not forget easily.I bought it for the brillant graphics, but discovered that there is so much more.The gameplay is fun, although it takes some time to get used to the fighting controls. Most fights are head-on, though, with only few opportunities for stealth. The boss fights are among the most memorable I have encountered, I especially loved Artemis. So many good ideas with masterful execution. It just does not get old.The storyline is simply immense (saying 'epic' would be redundant, since the story is packed into an ancient epic style), with interesting twists and great storytelling. Also, the music is great.Apotheon is a masterpiece, I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.			"

												This is a beautiful, well crafted and engaging gem of a game.An amazing atmosphere is created by the fantastic art style, excellent voice acting and fabulous soundtrack. The various levels are well designed and the game makes exploration really enjoyable. As you progress, Apotheon continues to offer new challenges and this keeps the game-play fresh and engaging. The combat is satisfying and the puzzles in the game are fun to complete. I love how each area has some unique ideas specific to certain aspects of Greek Mythology. I have really enjoyed exploring in this game and coming across the various gods that I have read about in books. I love how you are able to read occasional excerpts from Homer and others when you come across them as you explore.  Apotheon is an enjoyable side-scrolling action RPG. I feel that its awesome style and its subject matter elevates it into being a truly excellent game. I really enjoyed my time with Apotheon and I definitely recommend it.			"

												Man, this game is just really cool. The art style is very unique, as if the whole game is being read off of Greek walls or pottery. Music is great and ties in nicely with the intense atmosphere of the game. Voice acting is top notch (Ricepirate voices Ares, if you don't know who that is look that beautiful man up.) Combat is smooth, and you really feel the weight behind each hit you deal and take. The story is simple, but believable and awesome. The game itself is free roam once you get to Olympus, with fast travel. There are a few sidequests that will require you to go to areas you've gone through before, but never in a way where you feel like you're backtracking or wasting time. All in all, every moment of this game feels like a lot of time and love was put into it. 19 hours and two playthroughs in and I only have two small qualms. Firstly, the game has randomly crashed on me twice, though a reload fixed it and I could go on playing with no problems. Secondly, a sensitivity option would be helpful. I tried playing with my 360 controller for about an hour, and though the controls were fine targetting in combat was rather difficult because it was hard to make precise hits. The sensitivity is pretty darn high with a controller.For $15, yes. Get this game. It's worth it.			"

												Game Overview•	Unique art style is complimented by lively game world and fulfilling environments.•	Characters and enemies fill every corner, never a boring moment.•	Exploration is rewarded and actually quite enjoyable, that is a definite rarity.•	Challenging experience that provides a sense of satisfaction after completion.•	Combat heavily reliant on skill and strategy.•	Lack of item management leads to clustered inventory.•	Barebones (local) multiplayer mode, might as well not have been included.•	Well worth the time spent playing.•	Tremendous variety of items and weaponry.•	Aiming is restricted.•	Unrefined control of mechanics, but they work well nonetheless.•	Amazingly executed concept that is fun to play, which is the point of video games.These facts are snippets of my video review of the game, if you would like to see a more in depth evaluation, watch it.

												Apotheon contains the main ingredients needed to produce an astonishing game!It has a great combat system- The combat system might seem simple but it actually has a cheeky trick to it... Heavier weapons (eg: Sagiris) take longer to swing whilst lighter weapons (eg: Dagger) are quick and nimble-The combat allows for free aim no matter what weapon is equipped-Combat is influenced by the ""Stamina bar"" this prevents players from aimlessly swinging at beasts with full force defeating the difficulty of the game.. instead allows for players to strategically parry , block , and attack in a violent dance with the opposing foeApotheon has quite an accurate depiction of Greek/Hellenic Mythology and plays this well into a character driven storylineThere are many upgrades that can be made : such as-Armour upgrades-Weapon purchases-Alchemy (Health Nectarys and Greek Fire bombs etc...)-Weapons TrainingOverall Apotheon is an excellent game with quite an extensive and gripping storyline! Combines upgrades to the Character and a Clever combat system that produces an addicting and fun game... I highly reccomend purchasing this game <3			"

												Apotheon is an unique game for its art style. If you enjoy fighting/platforming games in beautifully crafted worlds go ahead the Greek Mythology awaits! My only complain goes to the physics, in combat, soldiers feel like paper, they feel ""happy wheels""ish. I'm all in for games that innovate, platforming games have been around but not with this kind of visuals.If you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video:

												Art style is literally ancient, absolutely beautiful and fresh in the industry. This is why i bought this game.Gameplay is your typical platformer with a lot of combat. There are cRPG elements: new weapons and armor, training melee proficiency. Game is short, it took me 20h, with all but one achievement.QA was very good; glitches are rare, have not seen any errors. Only the multiplayer is in beta, with mostly empty lobby.Story is present, but it is not the most important element of the game. It is linear, however, you can choose the order of taking challenges. You can revisit places. There are a lot of static quotes from ancient greek texts. They provide background for what you are fighting with, next.9/10			"

												I wish I liked this game more. I like the art style and the aesthetic. The gameplay, however, is very loose, moreso than I expected. The jumps are floaty and the combat feels haphazard and slapdash instead of the tight 2D combat that I prefer. The analog stick leaves movement less desireable instead of giving me more control.It does not feel good to play this game.			"

												Great metroidvania-like game. Very close to the original greek myths and lots of attention to detail. Also the artstyle is beautiful.I finished the game 100% in my first playthrough, which wasn't too hard. In my second playthrough I finished the hardmode (not on 100% though) which was harder but still not too difficult.The combat feels a little clunky sometimes, but if you like greek mythology, metroidvania-like gameplay and the artstyle then this is the game for you.

												The first thing to really notice about Apotheon is the art: the aesthetic choices for the game are truly superb.  The whole game looks like it's taking place on the side of an ancient Greek vase, and the lines and composition are frequently beautiful. The soundtrack is quite good, and the voice acting is above par to boot, making for a great experience overall.  The game incorporates snippets of Greek mythology, from the writings of Homer to various Orphic hymns, producing an unusual atmosphere for a video game, let alone one of this category.Mechanically - well, it's a side-scrolling 2-D platformer.  That isn't one of my favorite genres by a long shot (in fact, I usually avoid them).  This category inevitably means a bit of frustration for me with the de rigueur boss fights, the lack of any choice in how the story plays out, and so on.Apotheon got quite a bit better for me, though, once I moved from keyboard-and-mouse to Steam controller to play, with a minor exception (as I'll explain below).  With mouse and keyboard, it's just too hard to be facing the right direction when fighting, but controller play deals with that considerably better.  Except when you need to, say, aim down a long tunnel to hit a target with an arrow.  Then I pretty much had to go back to mouse and keyboard for that specific trick - no amount of fussing with my Steam controller settings could get the aiming to work with any amount of sensitivity, and there is no way to address sensitivity in-game at all.(It's worth noting that I have played other 2-D side-scrollers with mouse and keyboard without this problem and I have played other 2-D side-scrollers with the Steam controller without these problems.  These issues seem to be something very particular about how Apotheon works, and it is the worst aspect of the game.)Many players also complain that the combat is clunky, and I can honestly say that I find it terrible - but that is with the caveat that I frequently find the combat in these sorts of games terrible, so I can't tell if it's genuinely wonky, or I just do not enjoy this sort of thing and since I am only trying to get through the silly boss fights to see where the story actually goes and what the next area looks like.  Just know that in Apotheon, strikes must be aimed and they must be relatively precise; meanwhile enemies will dodge - and will often spring around crazily like mad frogs - which I found to be somewhat disconcerting, and which did not seem to fit well with the game's other artistic choices and tone.  Bottom line though: if you're looking for someone to appreciate unusual or varied combat in game of this genre, it's definitely not me, so take what I say with that grain of salt here.I got best into the game by floundering through the opening level, mashing buttons until I had (slowly) sublimated attacking, dodging and rolling, and switching weapons, and then I started over in order to pay attention to the story and scenes instead of being focused more on ""Oh damn it, I didn't mean to throw that! Bwah! Why am I facing the wrong direction?!?""  That generally provided a better experience for that secondary start and subsequent play.Otherwise, though, the game is an interesting experience, and looking around provided me a ton of entertainment.  I'd definitely buy and play follow-ups to this game in the vein of Egyptian, Japanese, Sumerian, Aztec, and so on just to see the art and experience the mythology, honestly.  It's worth the admission price for that alone.			"

												Apotheon is a gorgeous 2D side-scrolling action game where you are a hero battling or gaining favor against the mythological gods and gain their powers. The art style and graphics are outstanding along with the music and sound. The platforming and the combat is a little clunky, however if you can get over that you will have a lot of fun, if not the game can be somewhat frustrating with the slow and clunky fighting. There are plentfiul of weapons to choose from and a wide variety of areas you will explore. If you are a fan of mythology and enjoy 2D side-scrolling games then you will have fun with this one. The game took me about 12 hours to complete everything which for this game feels like the right amount of time.			"

												Gorgeous art style and direction aside, Apotheon is a game that I highly recommend.  The premise is really intriguing, and the manner in which you go about achieving your goals isn't really repetitive, a healthy mix of combat and puzzle solving, while exploring the domains of various Greek gods.  Even the optional powers (Aphrodite, Dionysus, Hermes, and Hephestaus) aren't boring and don't really feel ""tacked on.""  The other various sidequests in which you look for stashes of weapons or other secrets with hints from notes found around the game are really cool as well, allowing you to explore the various areas with an objective, rather than ""just because.""

												REASONS TO BUY+ Art style that perfectly imitates Ancient Greek art.+ The story actually caught my attention because it was quite an interesting twist on Ancient Greek mythology and the finale was fantastic.+ Plays like a bit like castlevania but with a consistent variety of gameplay mechanics.+ Lots of items in the game that all present unique combat interactions.+ Lots of interesting optional side quests and and plenty of secret areas.+ A full run is about 8-10 hours on the starting difficulty; it ends before its stale.+ Items have durability but can be purchased again, Even the rarest items are available for repurchase on a black market NPC in case you're favourite weapons break.+ Relatively easy to earn achievements (you have an opportunity to obtain anything you missed before the game ends) but a second playthrough is required on a harder difficulty for 100% completion.REASONS TO RECONSIDER+ Many of the seemingly minor mechanics seem intended for the harder difficulty that only unlocks after beating the game. For instance, there is a crafting system that is perhaps too generous on your first playthrough+ Some merchants upgrade skills and armour so make sure you break everything to pay for the upgrades+ Certain items cannot be purchased and may block your ability to advance such as Picklocks so it is vital that you break absolutely every box you can+ Combat is only interesting if you switch weapons a lot which is why I believe items have durability in the first place - to encourage variety. If you have a favourite weapon type and try to stick to only using it then you may find the game tedious so try to experiment+ Combat can feel clunky at times but only if you'reon top of each other+ Hold left or right to gradually transition from walking to run but for some reason the character slows his pace if the terrain changes. I found myself jumping to extend the speed I was running before the slower pace began again.CONCLUSION+ It's an experience that I really enjoyed. I adored the art, it was absolutely stunning. It's just a completely well executed and polished game from beginning to end that merits the purchase for anyone even considering it.			"

												Apotheon.I still dont know what to say after playing it for a while.It is a good game but not the best I have ever played. It is certainly enjoyable and easy to play but it can be very confusing at times as well.I bougth the game, when Jerma said that he was voiceacting for it and I just wanted to hear it ingame myself. Now even though that was the main reason, I dont regret buying it at all for other reasons.The Artstyle is beautiful and the voiceacting is on point. Fighting in this game is a little bit tricky but the player has enough chances not to die on various occasions. Like you can get knocked down to 1 health, and if you are quick and roll away you can heal yourself with a potion and head back into the fight.The bossfights range from puzzles to actual fights. The puzzles take some time to understand and the fights themself... Well I found them a bit underwhelming. Even me, being decent enough to have no problems (or not many), managed to get thrown all over the place when fighing Neptune or the Giants. Other enemies didnt make it easier either. In the end it comes down to you being more spamhappy with the weapon than actual skilled combat, but that comes down to the 2D style of combat.So do I recommend this game? Yea. Its enjoyable and you can surely waste a lot of time with it by figuring out its secrets and hidden rooms and of course by playing its main game.			"

												Absolutely blown away by this game. It deserves way more attention than it has. I don't even know where to begin..The art direction, sound design, combat mechanics..everything is just fantastic. I haven't been surprised by an indie game like this in...I don't think..ever! If there's one game that it reminds me of (from a gameplay perspective) it would have to be Medieval for the PS1.The only thing keeping it from being perfect is the sometimes clunky targeting system when faced with several opponents, and sometimes you can get stuck in corners or the game will simply stop, both causing you to have to restart, but each level is so fun to play you probably won't mind having to do it over again.If you are a fan of video games of any kind, at all, even if you only play Goat Simulator, this is still a MUST buy, it's an absolute blast from start to finsh and you will not be disappointed.P.SFor those of you playing with the steam controller, be sure to set your trackpad in the options menu to ""joystick"" or you will have camera and targeting problems.

												Spoiler Free Review: I was super excited for this game when I found it, but after playing and earning all of the achievements, I'm not quite sure what to think of it.  I'm reminded a lot by the PS3 games God of War, which maybe what I'm trying to compare this too, which is not fair.  Apotheon is a stylistic side scroller for one.  The graphics are excellent - nothing realistic mind you, rather what you'd see on ancient vases which provides an excellent ascetic.  The story is nothing special, simular stories have been told in a variety of settings. The controls on this game are what bring me down.  Playing on a keyboard maybe the issue, instead of a controller.  Be prepared for tons of dodging.  I wish after earning of few of the gods powers you could take more of a stance, however that is not the case.  As the game progress you'll find yourself spamming the dodge keys more and more, until frankly it feels like that is all you ever do.  I ended up starting to run past enemies to get to doors or other key points to help speed the game along.There is no multiplayer or DLC available for this game.  I played through the game twice, which the second time was quite a chore, but required to earn an achievement.If you like the genre like I do, then I'd recommend purchasing it.  If however you could care less about ancient culture, then I'd suggest looking for a different game. Rating: 5 out of 10. Barely recommended.Playing on i7-6700, 16Gb Ram, GTX1070			"

												Let me just start with this: I know that the plot is incredibly farfetched from Ancient Greek Mythology in the sense that the gods could not just be killed by a mortal.  As a student of Ancient Greek litterature and mythology, this is a bit ""out there"" in that respect.  That being said, in every other respect I can think of, the game was spot on.  More than spot on, in fact.  The little tablets with ancient translations were incredible.  The names of the weapons were all in correct Greek spelling.  I was truly impressed with the detail that was put into the game.  Both the mythological and historical accuracy were amazing.Moving on the graphics: I was a huge fan.  In creating a platformer, I know that there are a lot of options for styles of the visuals.  The choice of Ancient Greek art style was genius.  It puts the gamer right in Ancient Greece.  This art is the same as that on greek pottery.  Once again, an awesome detail that really made the game that much better.Don't worry, I am certainly not going to overlook the gameplay.  It was a blast.  I was impressed with the combat in the sense that you have to judge your enemies next attck and there are so many possibilities to destroy your adversary.  The designers managed to make each stage tailored for that god, leading to underwater bouts, chases on horseback, and tricky mazes.  These all integrated combat with unique foes.In addition, your practically endless arsenal of creative Greek weapons and shields makes sure that each fight is interesting.  Once again, many of these weapons are found in ancient Greek culture, but many new weapons were created based on stories myths.  Discovering these weapons is really cool as you find more specialty items.This game is a must-have for everyone (especially for any of you classics students like me!)			"

												A visually and mechanically interesting action platformer. Combat can be a bit frustrating at times when enemies are either hugging you (causing hit detection to fail) or trying to stay out of your reach, but once you conquer the learning curve the game becomes quite fun. As you progress through the game you'll gain new abilities and weapons and empower your character. The campaign took me about 10 hours to complete on my first try, going for 100% item collection, which is a good size for a game like this.Worth checking out, but as mentioned earlier, the combat mechanics will take a bit to get used to.

												Let me just start with this: I know that the plot is incredibly farfetched from Ancient Greek Mythology in the sense that the gods could not just be killed by a mortal.  As a student of Ancient Greek litterature and mythology, this is a bit ""out there"" in that respect.  That being said, in every other respect I can think of, the game was spot on.  More than spot on, in fact.  The little tablets with ancient translations were incredible.  The names of the weapons were all in correct Greek spelling.  I was truly impressed with the detail that was put into the game.  Both the mythological and historical accuracy were amazing.Moving on the graphics: I was a huge fan.  In creating a platformer, I know that there are a lot of options for styles of the visuals.  The choice of Ancient Greek art style was genius.  It puts the gamer right in Ancient Greece.  This art is the same as that on greek pottery.  Once again, an awesome detail that really made the game that much better.Don't worry, I am certainly not going to overlook the gameplay.  It was a blast.  I was impressed with the combat in the sense that you have to judge your enemies next attck and there are so many possibilities to destroy your adversary.  The designers managed to make each stage tailored for that god, leading to underwater bouts, chases on horseback, and tricky mazes.  These all integrated combat with unique foes.In addition, your practically endless arsenal of creative Greek weapons and shields makes sure that each fight is interesting.  Once again, many of these weapons are found in ancient Greek culture, but many new weapons were created based on stories myths.  Discovering these weapons is really cool as you find more specialty items.This game is a must-have for everyone (especially for any of you classics students like me!)			"

PROS Art Style - The biggest hook of Apotheon (IMO). The ancient greek clay pot style is very well done. I was initially worried if it is one of those styles that looks amazing only in screenshots but it looks great even in motion! Music - Both the combat music and the mellow BGM are fantastic. The soundtrack has everything you would expect from a game like this - cheesy greek chanting goodness and everything. Combat - Takes a bit to get used to but after I got into the groove of things I was switching between melee, ranged, potions and utility items in combat as the need arose. Everything feels very satisfying with the graphics and audio adding to the effect. Gameplay Variety - The meat of the game is the stabbing and running as you would think but there are some levels in the game (Especially the ones where you appease/antagonize the various Gods) that really explore the other aspects of the game that are supported but not the focus like stealth, platforming, and puzzles. I picked up a sarissa (long spear) and realized how amazing I look with it along with a large round shield and greek helmet. Alientrap, you hit the ""feel"" of the game right out of the park!CONS Tutorials - I had to learn about the different swings on a melee weapon in a third party forum after some hours in the game. If I missed an obvious tutorial which taught this I redact this CON, but I wish such a essential mechanic was shown. Armor - I LOVE the look of the armors in the game but after you max out on armor upgrades the satisfaction of finding a piece of armor dropped off. I actually reloaded an earlier save when I realized that the gold I spent on armor upgrades were only unlocking the look of the armor (After maxing out) Mute Protagonist - It didn't affect me much at first but when Nikandreos made big story decisions on his own without any real explanation it really stood out. It only happens in a couple of places but those really felt off. Even if a narrator explained Nikandreos' motivation or reasoning it would have sufficed! IT ENDEDRecommended For: Those who want to play a fun, tight, and exciting action game and who either are mythology enthusiasts or those who love the old ""One mortal man versus the Gods"" trope. Even though it took me ~11 hours to finish the game on the normal difficulty the time really flew because I was having such a blast. A+!			"

												Brilliant, just absolutely brilliant.Incredibly fun, surprisingly immersive and with a beautiful and unique artstyle, if you really hate Greek pottery you might disagree with me.Apotheon tells the tale of Nikandreos, a man who takes up arms against the Gods when they decide to abandon humanity.Fight mythological beasts and Gods on moun Olympus and save humanity.This game is easily worth the asking price, with gameplay that is relatively easy to learn and with great writing.Apotheon is a fantastic game and a must buy for any fans of Greek mythology.Oh and did I mention that the soundtrack is pretty epic as well.Easily worth the asking price, and if you find it on sale you would be a fool not to pick it up.

												I think Apotheon might have gotten overlooked by many when it came out. It's a little sad, since the game is great. The multiplayer isn't maybe the greatest, but the campaign is in my opinion the sole reason to get the game. It's a great sidescrolling action-RPG experience which are actually quite rare these days. Completing the campaign takes somewhere around 10 hours, but there are a few optional bits around the place and there is room for replayability for achievement hunters. If you're at all familiar with Greek mythology, visiting mount olympos and battling the different gods will probably feel awesome, especially with the absolutely GORGEOUS art style the game has. I mean just look at it, it's as if real pottery came to life. The combat is also potent and can be really fun especially when fighting harder enemies in single combat. It reminds me a little of games like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare for example, but with added rolling and jumping in a sidescrolling environment.All in all, the game's visuals are justification enough for the purchase, and even though the multiplayer is a little dumbed down and the campaign can feel like it's over too soon, I would definetely recommend it. Especially during a sale.			"

												Super stylish metroidvania with a whole controller full of buttons and moves.  It is as fun as you would expect from this type of game - and as an added bonus it has multiplayer, nice. And I have to say how much I love learning about the Greek gods as I playing through the story. (Stupid Zeus neglecting poor ol' humanity).The first minute or so of the campaign is super laggy, but apart from that it is all good. It reminds me of Mark of the Ninja with how well this metroidvania is excuted, except of course this is greek themed. Buy it now or wait until it is on sale if you are unsure.			"

												Cool little game. Combat takes a bit to get used to, but is varied and satisfying, with numerous weapon types of lots of gory bits. There's lots of adventuring to be had, although the Metroidvania aspect is pretty minimal, and backtracking generally is only neccesary for some sidequests. Art style is somewhat monotone but definitely focused and refresing. Check it out!			"

												It's hard not to recommend this game, and i feel it may be semi biased since I really think it did a lot of things right, however i think at the core of the game, I am just bored and have no desire to continue playing.The music and atmosphere are there for sure, the voice acting is even pretty decent. But maybe this is just me, but the visual style was just not my thing. I see what they were going for but it sorta just becomes the mess of black on black, breaking pots and smashing everything just to replace weapons that break in 10 swings. Its not entirely engaging that every soldier looks the same (for the first hour i played) and the flash animation style leaves something to be desired, the characters just feel so lifeless. The physicisy felt so awkward getting randomly thrown. I suppose many may not feel this way, but I was simply not having fun.Also Something about breaking weapons in games has never settled with me. It's an annoying mechanic that once i shuffle through my crappy weapons i finally find one i like and then its gone again.  Strangely I'm ok with the dark souls way of doing it, durability and repairing them, but i feel like i get my fair use of the weapon before its broken.  Even then it is a bit annoying.  But here no, once it's gone, it's gone.Level design is quite... tediuos and unmemorable. Most outside area's don't really have any outstanding features that make them memorable, and i suppose for me thats partly on the visual style. Most indoor atmospheres feel very samey. Plenty of exploration with very little reward in big environment that feel more daunting to explroe than exciting. Lastly the combat simply feels awkward to me. Maybe I am doing something wrong but It doesn't feel like i'm making meaningful combat choices, i'm simply running up and trying to chop at something with an awkard hitbox that can miss even if i'm standing next to them because the tip of my weapon extended slightly beyond the enemy. I realize that 1 hour is probably not the most fair assesment of a game, and you may enjoy it, but for me, im sitting here thinking that i'm genuinely bored with a genre i'm usually enthralled to play , a few design changes could have made this game in my personal experience far more enjoyable.

												Just finished the campaign, on champion difficulty.What a special game.One of the greatest metroidvanias I've ever played.Among the many Apotheon qualities I think combat is the highlight.2D games use to be frantic rapid-fire / button mashers, but not here.Apotheon's stamina-based, weapon-shield, defense-counter-attack mechanics are very well done and require some strategy. Sorry by the cliche, but at the time it's the closer to a ""2D Dark Souls"" we can get.About the art style and soundtrack... well, see for yourselves.Alientrap, I praise and thank you for the amazing work.

												I studied Latin and Greek hexameter poetry at university so I normally hate games set in ancient Greek mythology, but I liked this - they clearly give a damn about making it authentic and have bothered to look up some black figure pot art!Their grasp of ancient Greek theology is a bit squiffy in places: a definite tendency to turn the gods that we find sympathetic nowadays into goodies, and the inscrutable, all-powerful type ones into baddies. The controls are really really floaty which put me off playing on hard. Easy was loads of fun though. The level design is absolutely world-class and they always used the engine in creative ways, whether it was racing in a hunt against Artemis in stag form or frantically trying to chuck invading dead people off Charon's barge. The music and voice acting are excellent throughout. Lots of pertinent quotes from Homer scattered about and every NPC is a name-drop... I just wish they could have been a bit more restrained with the overall plot, which is sadly pretty similar to God of War. The fact Zeus doesn't clobber humanity in a fit of divine grumpiness is sort of the point of him.			"

												The amount of bitter disappointments I have wasted time and money on - the amount of games where so clearly a developer has had a brilliant idea, something incredible, and... it comes to nothing. My library is full of high-concept games that developers have obviously given up on, not up to the task of properly actualising the great idea.I saw Apotheon when it first came out, and I thought 'beautiful, but I daresay that'll be it', and I ignored it. When in the steam sale it was something like £2.50, I thought 'why not...' How wrong I had been to judge and underestimate.Everything is wonderful. The graphics are beautiful. The soundtrack is faultless, the voice-acting is brilliant. Level-design provides challenge but nothing is ridiculously difficult - it is well thought-out and achieveable.Gameplay is very enjoyable - this is the most I've enjoyed a game in years, including games I've put dozens or hundreds of hours into. And as good as the gameplay is, it's made all the better by how much effort has gone into everything around it; as mentioned, the graphics, the soundtrack, the voice-acting... Everything works in unison to create something really special. Not to mention dozens and dozens of weapons to choose from, a nice level of customisation [tiered armour and several different top-tier helmets], sidequests...There's niggles, but it's nothing truly annoying, just noticable - and nothing that isn't very fixable.This is the game I would have given a foot to have played as a kid. I really can't believe something of this quality was so cheap in the sale.I'm the worst sort of philhellene so this is a dream come true. I've just finished it and I am looking forward to trying it on the hardest difficulty. I cannot remember the last game which really... possessed me, it will have been years since the last. Apotheon has really brought my imagination into blossom.			"

												Apotheon is one of my favorite platformers, period. The music and art are absolutely SUPURB. I highly recommend playing this game with good headphones, because it's worth fully sinking into. It's gorgeous, thematic, with great voice acting and a pretty good, fitting story (if you've played God of War, it will feel really familiar). There is a wide variety of weapons, and they are all interesting in their own right. Because of the way weapons degrade in the game, I ended up trying all of them at least once, out of curiosity or necessity. The combat using said weapons is incredibly satisfying; the sound effects and the tight hitboxes really drove every hit home. Some parts of the game were definitely more challenging than others, and it never felt frustrating. My only problems with this game have to do with the inventory management/controls, and slight bugginess. You can hold a very large number of weapons at a time, and it can be really tedious to equip the one you are looking for. You have to have the right type equipped (melee, ranged, tools, or support) and then scroll with the scroll wheel until you reach the right one. You can't really find what you want unless you take your eyes off of the action, which I didn't like at all. Also, the wide variety of weapons and potions in the game can feel a bit excessive at times. I used many of the weapons (and enjoyed the variety from a historical/mythological standpoint), but I rarely touched any support potions other than the healing one, which has its own hotkey. There are also a few bugs in the game, but none of them were totally game-breaking. They would either cause crashes or a need to restart (due to an invisible wall or something), but the game would continue from a very recent checkpoint. Apotheon is not perfect, but it is also really, really good. I wholeheartedly recommend it. After seeing this game, I couldn't stop thinking ""why didn't I think of this?! It's such a good idea for a game,"" and it's well-implimented. I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see more; with Egyptian hierogliphic art! "

Introduction:Apotheon is an action adventure platformer based on ancient Greek mythology.  The gods have turned their backs on humanity, and you play as Nikandreos, a mortal warrior who takes up arms against the gods in order to save mankind.  Choose your weapon and get your war-face on, because it's about to get bloody divine up in here!TLDR Highlights:++ Artwork++ Level Design++ Challenging Combat+ Voice Acting+ Music- Combat Controls- Inventory SystemReview:PROS -- For starters, the artwork is amazing and really gives this game that ancient Greek mythological atmosphere!  It seriously amazed me the whole way through the game, because all of the different characters and monsters and maps kept bringing something new to the table.Speaking of which, the level design was incredible.  Each level and location had it's own style and theme, not to mention it's own challenges and puzzles and combat strategies.  Not once did I feel bored or think to myself, ""Oh, this again....""  because Apotheon keeps mixing it up and throwing something new at you every time you turn around.As for combat, I found it to be quite a challenge, especially in the beginning when it took some getting used to.  Enemies are really good at dodging and blocking your attacks and putting themselves in great positions to attack you.  You'll need to master blocking and rolling, but also how to press an attack.  There are so many different weapons and fighting with each one can be a completely different experience.  For example, keep your distance and be sure to hit the enemy with the point end of the spear, not the shaft.  Use maces and clubs to break shields faster.  Hit enemies in the legs to take them to the ground, and use the momentum of a jumping attack to do more damage.  All these things matter!  Simply diving into the fray and mashing buttons won't be very effective.  In fact, it's more than likely going to get you killed!After all of that, it's the voice acting and music that breathes life into Apotheon, making the game that much more immersive and exciting.CONS -- Admittedly, the first hour or so of the game was a bit of a struggle for me, thanks to the controls, which were somewhat difficult to master.  This made combat even more challenging too, at least early on in the game.  There was a point near the beginning when I questioned whether or not this purchase was a good one.  If you ever feel the same way, take a deep breath, and keep trying, because it won't take too long before you're a force to be reckoned with!Sort of related to combat controls is the downside of the inventory system.  As I mentioned earlier, there are a ton of weapons to choose from in the game, which means there's a lot to cycle through when you're changing weapons.  And it's an even bigger pain in the middle of battle.  Honestly, I'm not sure how it could have been done any better, but you do learn to plan ahead (where you can), selecting your main melee weapon, ranged weapon, potion, etc, before charging into battle rather than after it starts.  Still, it's a constant struggle regardless.OVERALL --  There's not much debate to be made here.  I'm extremely pleased with the game and even the early struggle with the controls can't come close to changing that.  If you are thinking about trying the game out, DO IT.  Apotheon is a real gem, and I highly recommend it!			"

Honestly, I'm not sure how it could have been done any better, but you do learn to plan ahead (where you can), selecting your main melee weapon, ranged weapon, potion, etc, before charging into battle rather than after it starts.  Still, it's a constant struggle regardless.OVERALL --  There's not much debate to be made here.  I'm extremely pleased with the game and even the early struggle with the controls can't come close to changing that.  If you are thinking about trying the game out, DO IT.  Apotheon is a real gem, and I highly recommend it!			"

												Apotheon is one of my favorite platformers, period. The music and art are absolutely SUPURB. I highly recommend playing this game with good headphones, because it's worth fully sinking into. It's gorgeous, thematic, with great voice acting and a pretty good, fitting story (if you've played God of War, it will feel really familiar). There is a wide variety of weapons, and they are all interesting in their own right. Because of the way weapons degrade in the game, I ended up trying all of them at least once, out of curiosity or necessity. The combat using said weapons is incredibly satisfying; the sound effects and the tight hitboxes really drove every hit home. Some parts of the game were definitely more challenging than others, and it never felt frustrating. My only problems with this game have to do with the inventory management/controls, and slight bugginess. You can hold a very large number of weapons at a time, and it can be really tedious to equip the one you are looking for. You have to have the right type equipped (melee, ranged, tools, or support) and then scroll with the scroll wheel until you reach the right one. You can't really find what you want unless you take your eyes off of the action, which I didn't like at all. Also, the wide variety of weapons and potions in the game can feel a bit excessive at times. I used many of the weapons (and enjoyed the variety from a historical/mythological standpoint), but I rarely touched any support potions other than the healing one, which has its own hotkey. There are also a few bugs in the game, but none of them were totally game-breaking. They would either cause crashes or a need to restart (due to an invisible wall or something), but the game would continue from a very recent checkpoint. Apotheon is not perfect, but it is also really, really good. I wholeheartedly recommend it. After seeing this game, I couldn't stop thinking ""why didn't I think of this?! It's such a good idea for a game,"" and it's well-implimented. I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see more; with Egyptian hierogliphic art! "

												Wow what an awesome game.  I have been meaning to pick up Apotheon for a while now but never have gotten around to it for some reason.  This steam sale I happen to notice it on sale for less than $4 and snagged it finally.  At 74% off it it a total steal.  So far I have less than 2 hours invested but they have been a fun two hours and I have enjoyed every minute.  The artwork is beautiful, the gameplay is very nice (using 360 controller) and heck I even am digging the music which I rarely leave music playing while gaming.  I am a big Greek Mythology fan so I am enjoying the lore in the game.  The game is a very good Metrodvania type platformer and I very much wish I had picked it up earlier.  I highly recommend.  This is going to be one of those few games that I can already tell that I will actually finish instead of collecting dust along with hundreds of other games in my steam library.			"

												This is a diamond in the rough. The art style, music and spoken dialog alone makes this title worth so much more than they're charging for. The animation in the video may seem stiff, but let me say that the controls are spectacular. To go between thrusting with a spear, rolling backwards and then hurling the spear, lifting my shield then thrusting a sword attack in one big natural motion makes me feel like I'm commanding the combat. The game plays out like a metroidvania, you boldly defy hubristic gods and suffer for it, which makes success taste sweeter.My only gripe is that aiming with the right pad on the Steam Controller takes a bit of getting used to, but the auto-aim is generally spot on enough that I rarely use that anyways.Oh, right. The god damned joke.10/10 would spit on Apollo again			"

Posted: July 13, 2015
												I never write reviews, but this game was so good that I had to. Here are the most important points:1) Graphics/art - I've never seen anything like it, unless you want to count the ancient Greek art it's based on. Seriously, just watch the preview video - its beautiful. Very crisp, with interesting uses of color and good detail. The creators even include readable stone etchings in the game that have real passages from ancient Greek literature, further adding to the atmosphere. The best way to say it, I think, is that the game has a feel of authenticity about it. You can really tell that the creators did their homework, and I think they did a fantastic job of giving the Greek mythos life. 2) Music - Also fitting in with the setting, you will feel like Odysseus while you're listening to this soundtrack. War drums, chanting, full orchestrated scores - it's got it all. The tracks for the boss battles have a very epic feel to them; they really lend to the idea that you're fighting Gods.3) Gameplay -  Probably the other ""best"" from this game besides the art/music. I've never seen another game in this genre implement such a wide variety of weapons so well. You will have at your disposal quite a few ancient Greek weapons, including spears, swords, clubs, bow & arrows, javelins, greek fire, and a lot more. You can wield most weapons with a shield as well as throw them, and you can evasively roll back and forth to try and manuever into a better position or get behind your enemies. When you combine all of these elements, combat is very engaging and fun. Usually in games of this type, I find myself using one or two weapons that are clearly superior to the others, but that isn't the case here. I can honestly say that I used every weapon class in the game effectively, and I think that using all of the different weapons is part of what makes this games so fun. I can only speculate that the creators realized this early on, which is why the weapons have durability that runs out decently fast - it forces you to experiment. The other aspect to the gameplay I wanted to mention is the scenario variety. Each boss battle, especially, and to a lesser degree, each quest, presents different sorts of challenges to the player. There is almost always more to it than ""hit this enemy until he dies"" or ""go to this location and pick up this item."" The level designs themselves are very unique, so often just getting through the level can be the most interesting part. 4) Collectibles/side quests - Some games suffer from having nothing else to do outside of the main questline, while others suffer from overloading the game with collectibles and time-consuming sidequests. In my opinion, this games walks the line well. There are 2 achievements for collecting - 1 for getting all of the unique weapons in the game, and one for opening all of the chests(lockboxes) in the game. The weapons, however, are often found in the chests, so really you can focus on just finding the chests, which are not terribly difficult to find if you are constantly looking out for breakable walls and making sure to explore every area thoroughly.  The sidequests available range from simple tasks to fairly complex series of events that require trips to multiple areas. I didn't find any of the sidequests to be frustrating, which is a mistake a lot of games make. 5) Minor points:- Each piece of armor you get permanently increases your total armor points, which basically acts as a second pool of hitpoints. However, you keep all of your old armor pieces, and since the increase is permanent, you can freely switch between armor pieces with no penalty. I found this to be very progressive and pleasing.- There is a multiplayer mode, though I cannot comment as I haven't tried it- A 3rd difficulty unlocks after you beat the game, Olympian Difficulty. Beating the game on this difficulty earns you the last achievement. 6) Negatives: not many for this game.- I did have one save become irrevocably corrupted at one point, and it crashed the game whenever I tried to load it. Luckily, the autosave saved the day for me. Hopefully this isn't a widespread issue.- The character movement can be a little clunky & hard to get used to, and I hate that the character stops running whenever I hit stairs. I highly recommend playing with a gamepad, though this may vary if you're used to using a mouse/keyboard all the time.			"

												Dark themed Grecian Metroidvania.If the above sentence piques your interest then look no further than Apotheon!Set in the wildly creative ancient Grecian times where Zues and his fellow gods and goddesses rule over the kingdom of man. You play as Nikandreos, a simple peasant armed with the responsibility to protect his beloved home town of Dion. Hera is there to meet you at the city's temple and tells you to vanquish the gods of Olympus. Thus begins an epic quest of godlike conquest. Mount Olympus can be seen as the world hub where you can explore different parts of the city, visit markets, break in to houses and even uncover a long buried secret or two.The primary structure of the game is to enter a God's domain through one of the game's two main hubs. Inside each domain is a vastly unique set piece where you must display skills related to the god at hand. For example, in the Forest of Artemis you will be tasked to hunt legendary beasts and possible become a beast yourself in your ultimate quest to take on Artemis herself! Likewise, in Poseidon's realm, you will have to brave the seas that the old god controls himself to calm the spiteful deity's wrong doings. Each area really does have a life of it's own even if it uses the same art style throughout. Another piece of conversation of its own is the art design.I have never seen anything like this game's visual design. It's a 2D-open world-sidescroller at heart but the way it is presented just bursts with originality. It is hard to explain but just looking at the screen shots gives you an idea of paintings come to life. The breathing vivid colors of these pieces come to life give a sense of wonderment and otherworldly experiences like no other metroidvania. The different domains of gods use this visual style by shifting color palettes perfectly to suit the environment you are in. From the warm orange glows of the central hub Agora to the soft off-white blues of Poseidon's sea palace to the muted dismal tones of Hades, the worlds are brought to individual life from this masterful design. The gameplay is engaging and does not get old even to the very end of Nikandreos's arduous quest to become one with the gods.The central gameplay element is exploring the realms of the gods and combat. Combat is simple yet intuitive as the popular deterrent to the norm of button mash is once again ill advised. Nikandreos attacks in concentrated swings, swings that drain a stamina bar which will cause him to take large amounts of breath in order to wind up another attack if he is not given some time to rest. Enemies do the same, where the have timed attacks and can shield/roll/fly/backpedal/ and charge at their opponent with little hesitation. While the combat is rather easy, I found the reactive style to be quite satisfying all the way through. Spear pieces flesh, sword slashes at sinews, and clubs bludgeon skulls. The instant ragdoll and sound of your foes dropping their weapons as their last breath leaves there sorry bodies is something to take in again and again.The other side of the game resides in the player following certain laid out quests in order to gain audience with the god of that domain. You will encounter secrets, puzzles, and platforming challenges as the game plays out. Each challenge is presented in some unique way that never makes you tire of the formulae at hand.There is a multiplayer that is both local and online, and while this is always welcomed I can see this being only a quick side interest to the major deal that is the single player campaign. There are also two difficulties with the last being unlocked after completing the game. I am curious to see how the increase challenge plays out and could easily provide more replay value for the hardcore Apotheoner.I can easily recommend Apotheon at it's full asking price of $15.00 USD. If you love metroidvania games then you will NOT be disappointed with Apotheon offering to the table!			"

												Apotheon is a 2d sidescrolling platformer taking place in Greek mythology. You play the role of Nikandros, a human whose civilization was forsaken by the gods. Seeing your city in ruins, you make an alliance with an opportunistic Hera, who guides you through your quest of assassination and dethroning. The graphics for this game are themed entirely around ancient Greek paintings such as those found on pottery or tapestries and it has a really neat look as a result. The soundtrack is also set along the same theme and various obelisks detailing actual Greek scripture can be found in each level. The weaponry mirrors that which one would find in ancient Greece and just about any other obvious reference you could make is accounted for.If I had to pick one beef in this game, it would have to be the controls. The control scheme in this game is very similar to terraria in that you have to both face your character towards enemies or items as well as “aim” him. Combat can be kind of tricky at first and combined with knockback effects, downright awkward. I found myself struggling just to land hits against an AI that instantaneously switches to the exact counter to my current weapon. Thankfully the game has potions and other items which can be used to easily resolve combat, although with the added detriment of a cheapened accomplishment when one uses a potion of invulnerability to cheese a boss battle. Additionally the quests can be both tiresome and predictable (come to an area, 3 sub-quests, rinse and repeat).In the end I didn’t think that Apotheon was a great game, but it wasn’t a terrible game either. If you can grab it for under $10 you’ll probably get your money’s worth on this one. "

												Artisticaly and technically speaking, this is one of the best games I have ever played. That's one hell of a phrase to throw around, but this game really earns it. This game went out to create the experience of being the hero greek myth and everything in the game goes to painstaking lengths to make sure you feel that way. The art is designed to look like it was painted on the side of a greek pot, where myths are so often seen painted, and everything seems to move that way as well. The voice acting is as good as one can ask for in an indie game and the music is brilliant. Youcan hear in the audio the epic and godly feel everythig is supposed to have. The combat feels very good and the need for skill is evident. Pulling off successful rolls into backstabs or taking down an dog as it jumps at you by throwing a well timed javelin is really rewarding.But the best part of the game is by far the level design. A lot of research and love and a truckload of creativity went into the level design. It is perfect in that every area works by precisely the same rules but still feels entirely unique.  Your job is to gain the power of that god by fulfilling some task in their place on olympus and confronting them. Each area is desgned to reflect the god who lives there. For instance, Artemis lives in  a grove where hunters slay game all day and in order to be allowed an audience with her you must become the greatest hunter by slaying dangerous beasts.  Ares, aways the bloodthirsty, lives in  a giant kill dungeon where people slaughter eachother in an endless rage and you must slaughter Ares' enemies to see him.  And Hades is built so be a sad, unsettling place where those you kill come back to life so as a result,  the undead horrors you find there respawn soon after re-dying,  this gives the player the feeling that they don't want to be there long and forces them to run through the land of the dead for fear of joining them.There are 7 different houses each with their own distinct feel which is what makes this game truly amazing and truly worth buying. The game was certainly not perfect and had quite a few flaws in terms of the execution of some of the fine points but artistically and design-wise, it is a masterpiece.			"

												CONVENTION: The masculine reproductive organ will be called 'pn' for now on.This game is completly awesome! 9/10. Very nice characterization of the gods, they truly feel like the ancient greek gods, with all the characteristics, in the way they behave and interact, the way their temples look. ETC... VERY well placed and intresting dialog, you will never, ""jesus i know already that, just skip it"", exepitional writing, O.K voice over, the main characters are kinda good voice over but the normal peasants/NPC have 3 sentences max. Awesome graphics and aesthetics. And the thing that impressed me the most is the maturity they addressed sexuality, the greek society was one of the first to have the vision 'men should be fit viril and smart', not brutes, the 'mind and body to the perfect' kinda of thing. And, a lot of their art, (one of the most well known greek caracterictics) relflect that vision, i bet you already seen a photo (or the actual one in a museum) of a greek statue, 6-pack, big abs, pn out, ""no fu*ks given"" expression. (if you didn't, this[www.goddessgift.net] is what I mean), their reflection of the greek society is just, simulator grade, they aren't afraid of showing boobs and pn where is needed, and they aren't childish about it.  Level desing is very good. Look awesome, (like I said you always have immersion you are in a greek world) and are also awesome to navigate through. And the gamplay is fabulous, challeging, fair and  scalable to be very hard. it's physhics/hack'n'slash/timing based. People seemed to like the music a lot. Personally I not even noticed.			"

Each challenge is presented in some unique way that never makes you tire of the formulae at hand.There is a multiplayer that is both local and online, and while this is always welcomed I can see this being only a quick side interest to the major deal that is the single player campaign. There are also two difficulties with the last being unlocked after completing the game. I am curious to see how the increase challenge plays out and could easily provide more replay value for the hardcore Apotheoner.I can easily recommend Apotheon at it's full asking price of $15.00 USD. If you love metroidvania games then you will NOT be disappointed with Apotheon offering to the table!			"

												I never write reviews, but this game was so good that I had to. Here are the most important points:1) Graphics/art - I've never seen anything like it, unless you want to count the ancient Greek art it's based on. Seriously, just watch the preview video - its beautiful. Very crisp, with interesting uses of color and good detail. The creators even include readable stone etchings in the game that have real passages from ancient Greek literature, further adding to the atmosphere. The best way to say it, I think, is that the game has a feel of authenticity about it. You can really tell that the creators did their homework, and I think they did a fantastic job of giving the Greek mythos life. 2) Music - Also fitting in with the setting, you will feel like Odysseus while you're listening to this soundtrack. War drums, chanting, full orchestrated scores - it's got it all. The tracks for the boss battles have a very epic feel to them; they really lend to the idea that you're fighting Gods.3) Gameplay -  Probably the other ""best"" from this game besides the art/music. I've never seen another game in this genre implement such a wide variety of weapons so well. You will have at your disposal quite a few ancient Greek weapons, including spears, swords, clubs, bow & arrows, javelins, greek fire, and a lot more. You can wield most weapons with a shield as well as throw them, and you can evasively roll back and forth to try and manuever into a better position or get behind your enemies. When you combine all of these elements, combat is very engaging and fun. Usually in games of this type, I find myself using one or two weapons that are clearly superior to the others, but that isn't the case here. I can honestly say that I used every weapon class in the game effectively, and I think that using all of the different weapons is part of what makes this games so fun. I can only speculate that the creators realized this early on, which is why the weapons have durability that runs out decently fast - it forces you to experiment. The other aspect to the gameplay I wanted to mention is the scenario variety. Each boss battle, especially, and to a lesser degree, each quest, presents different sorts of challenges to the player. There is almost always more to it than ""hit this enemy until he dies"" or ""go to this location and pick up this item."" The level designs themselves are very unique, so often just getting through the level can be the most interesting part. 4) Collectibles/side quests - Some games suffer from having nothing else to do outside of the main questline, while others suffer from overloading the game with collectibles and time-consuming sidequests. In my opinion, this games walks the line well. There are 2 achievements for collecting - 1 for getting all of the unique weapons in the game, and one for opening all of the chests(lockboxes) in the game. The weapons, however, are often found in the chests, so really you can focus on just finding the chests, which are not terribly difficult to find if you are constantly looking out for breakable walls and making sure to explore every area thoroughly.  The sidequests available range from simple tasks to fairly complex series of events that require trips to multiple areas. I didn't find any of the sidequests to be frustrating, which is a mistake a lot of games make. 5) Minor points:- Each piece of armor you get permanently increases your total armor points, which basically acts as a second pool of hitpoints. However, you keep all of your old armor pieces, and since the increase is permanent, you can freely switch between armor pieces with no penalty. I found this to be very progressive and pleasing.- There is a multiplayer mode, though I cannot comment as I haven't tried it- A 3rd difficulty unlocks after you beat the game, Olympian Difficulty. Beating the game on this difficulty earns you the last achievement. 6) Negatives: not many for this game.- I did have one save become irrevocably corrupted at one point, and it crashed the game whenever I tried to load it. Luckily, the autosave saved the day for me. Hopefully this isn't a widespread issue.- The character movement can be a little clunky & hard to get used to, and I hate that the character stops running whenever I hit stairs. I highly recommend playing with a gamepad, though this may vary if you're used to using a mouse/keyboard all the time.			"

												I bought this game on sale, and was not disappointed. This game isn't very long but it will make you smile if you like anything Greek mythology. - It has some really beautiful art designs that are consistent through the game.- Interesting weapons and battling mechanics.- Diverse looking areas and beautiful colors.- I enjoyed the voice acting, really helped to breathe life into the characters.- Some hidden away secrets and bonus weapons you have to search for which is nice. - Also you get to feel like a badass!So if you like 2D games are looking for a short adventure story, like fighting and weapons diversity, and love Greek Mythology. I think this is the game for you. Hope this helped, thanks for reading and please enjoy your day.  "

												I saw this being played a while ago on the YouTube and thought it was awesome.  Got it at the Black Friday sale for a steal, and looking back I would have payed the full price for this one.  To be fair, I am a Greek Mythology sucker, but that aside the voice acting, the story, the way the game flows makes it very pleasing t othe player.  The controls were a bit wonky at first, and I still whizz my spear directly into the ceiling or my foot more than I would care to admit, but in all this is really a well done game.  The graphics are what you'd expect - there is plenty to explore and things to kill....and continue stabbing even after they are ""dead"".If you are into Greek Mythology and scrollers, this is a no brainer.  If you are into one or the other - add it to your wishlist and wait for a sale!			"

												Apotheon is a 2d sidescrolling platformer taking place in Greek mythology. You play the role of Nikandros, a human whose civilization was forsaken by the gods. Seeing your city in ruins, you make an alliance with an opportunistic Hera, who guides you through your quest of assassination and dethroning. The graphics for this game are themed entirely around ancient Greek paintings such as those found on pottery or tapestries and it has a really neat look as a result. The soundtrack is also set along the same theme and various obelisks detailing actual Greek scripture can be found in each level. The weaponry mirrors that which one would find in ancient Greece and just about any other obvious reference you could make is accounted for.If I had to pick one beef in this game, it would have to be the controls. The control scheme in this game is very similar to terraria in that you have to both face your character towards enemies or items as well as “aim” him. Combat can be kind of tricky at first and combined with knockback effects, downright awkward. I found myself struggling just to land hits against an AI that instantaneously switches to the exact counter to my current weapon. Thankfully the game has potions and other items which can be used to easily resolve combat, although with the added detriment of a cheapened accomplishment when one uses a potion of invulnerability to cheese a boss battle. Additionally the quests can be both tiresome and predictable (come to an area, 3 sub-quests, rinse and repeat).In the end I didn’t think that Apotheon was a great game, but it wasn’t a terrible game either. If you can grab it for under $10 you’ll probably get your money’s worth on this one. "

												CONVENTION: The masculine reproductive organ will be called 'pn' for now on.This game is completly awesome! 9/10. Very nice characterization of the gods, they truly feel like the ancient greek gods, with all the characteristics, in the way they behave and interact, the way their temples look. ETC... VERY well placed and intresting dialog, you will never, ""jesus i know already that, just skip it"", exepitional writing, O.K voice over, the main characters are kinda good voice over but the normal peasants/NPC have 3 sentences max. Awesome graphics and aesthetics. And the thing that impressed me the most is the maturity they addressed sexuality, the greek society was one of the first to have the vision 'men should be fit viril and smart', not brutes, the 'mind and body to the perfect' kinda of thing. And, a lot of their art, (one of the most well known greek caracterictics) relflect that vision, i bet you already seen a photo (or the actual one in a museum) of a greek statue, 6-pack, big abs, pn out, ""no fu*ks given"" expression. (if you didn't, this[www.goddessgift.net] is what I mean), their reflection of the greek society is just, simulator grade, they aren't afraid of showing boobs and pn where is needed, and they aren't childish about it.  Level desing is very good. Look awesome, (like I said you always have immersion you are in a greek world) and are also awesome to navigate through. And the gamplay is fabulous, challeging, fair and  scalable to be very hard. it's physhics/hack'n'slash/timing based. People seemed to like the music a lot. Personally I not even noticed.			"

												Beautiful game! Who doesn't want to feel like they're playing a game on an old greek vase?! Ok a lot of people wouldn't, but if you like mythology at all you would.  The story is original but is far from just a nod at the mythos; very obviously done by someone who studied and not just a quick wikipedia reading.  The art depictions of the various figures are spot on (I won't be vulgar but I was very surprised at the accurate depiction of the saytyrs). I only need a few platformers as I'm not that into them, but I must say the mechanics are great. I had an xbox controller and found the controls decently mapped with very mild discomfort to learn. Now the bad... The inventory was slightly annoying to shift through and at times the physics, such as being flung around by combat, were off.  Frequently at certain points the game lagged and seemd to just run poorly.  While this was pretty awful at times it by no means made it unplayable.The story, sound, and visuals are supreme.  If it just ran a bit better it would be perfect. 9/10!			"

												A clever, well made Metroidvania with a distinct art style, unforgiving combat focused on timing and precision, and a slew of content makes this an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys the platformer/action game genre. While there's not much in the way of puzzles, the game is good about moving you from content to content, and no area ever feels ""too long"". Hidden areas and out of the way places abound, and you're constantly rewarded for exploring out of the way with a new weapon or piece of armor to use. Combat is fast and hectic, but button mashing can and will get you killed. Careful use of blocking and dodgerolling and counter attacking wins the day. Bosses are a variety of types and encounters. Upgrades are for the most part fairly minor - nothing so game changing as a double jump or a crazy new weapon tech. Most of it tends to be things like faster bow reloading, more effective potions, a small light aura so you don't need torches as much, and the like. The story is about what you would expect from an ancient Greek saga - but it stays true to those roots faithfully and respectfully, and presents time honored stories in a fashion that keeps them feeling mythic and heroic, rather than worn out and over-tread. A full set of well done voice acting for all the dialog helps a great deal as well.This isn't even mentioning the fact that there's multiplayer arena in the mix, which makes the game even better, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not, personally, but I could see how it'd greatly extend the life of the game.Great game, would definitely recommend.			"

												I fell in love with Apotheon at first sight. Of course the first thing I noticed is how gorgeous it looks, I love ancient Greek black and red figure pottery, and this is the perfect style for a 2D game about Greek mythology, which I also adore. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters is lovingly crafted. The switch in colour palettes works very well to give different moods and personality to the different levels. The music is fantastic aswell.The immersion is completed with superb writtng and voice acting. The inscriptions with actual texts from ancient authors from Homer and Hesiod to Apollodorus or Euripides are a beautiful detail that tells you the developers really did their research.Now to the gameplay. The combat is based in timing and momentum, the longer you run, the faster you run and if you hit an enemy with a running uppercut, it's joyous to see him flying away offscreen. I played with kb&m and managed well enough although sometimes I wasn't sure where my mouse was and couldn't turn or aim my blows effectively. The enemies can use the same moves, weapons and tricks you use, they switch between ranged and melee, they sometimes heal themselves, block, dodge and are generally competetnt AI. The weapons are varied and feel different, and you'll have to get used to different weapons because they break, even the special ones (they're not unique, only rare). Not usually a fan of weapon breaking but here it's done well. You always have other weapons you can use, even if they're not your specialty but you're never defenceless, and it won't be long until you can loot new weapons. I don't think I bought a single weapon from a trader in all my time ingame. Every item that's for sale you can find in the world (not so for training and crafting recipes).The levels have their own mechanics and each one feels unique and original. Same goes for the bossfights.As a negative point, the inventory management is not very good. Scrolling to select weapons gets a bit annoying when you have many and are looking for the right one. The shop inventory and the items description boxes can run off of the screen. But that's about it, I don't have any other complain. This is one of my favourite games of 2015, and if it's not THE favourite, it's because of The Witcher 3.			"

												Apotheon is a great side scroller combat game. If you are a fan of Greek mythology you will likely find yourself quite interested in the story this game has to tell. Never before in a side scroller has the art style fit the game so incredibly well. Each time I play it really makes it seems as though the story of Nikandreos is playing out on some sort of Ancient Greek art (pottery perhaps) restored to its full former glory. Occasionally the mouse directional combat can have you a bit confused but overall the game plays well and is an absolute pleasure to gaze upon.			"

												Really great game.The action of the game starts in an ancient Greek town and works its way to Olympus where you go with the intention to save your people. By the end of the game you actually start feeling like a true hero, even if the ending is slightly unexpected.Boss fights are engaging, and there's a few bosses indeed. Not all are about fighting 100%, for some you solve puzzles or take trials which makes the game actually seem engaging. Even for the bosses themselves, each have their own abilities and at times you need to perform several tasks before you can even start the battle.Furthermore, through the plaques sitting around you learn quite a bit about the actual myths and stories of real life ancient Greek gods, which is an awesome bonus.The artwork is amazing, it feels as if you're actually a mural on a greek wall/vase making your way and seeing the story being drawn so to say, and the artwork is really amazing in my opinion.The sound is nice, the music fits the moment and the athmosphere.You have different upgrades for your charater, weapons that do different things, both melee and ranged that you can upgrade by getting new and improved ones.One small problem is the attack direction, with melee weapons your character attacks depending on where your mouse is in 3 directions, direct attack, upwards attack and downwards. That being said it's a bit hard at times to actually get the attack you want. This will be mostly evident at melee bosses and at the last boss. Overall, an amazing game that I'm glad to have bought. Interesting, great story, great gameplay, visuals and music. Truly worth playing.			"

												Apotheon is one hell of a Metroidvania game. Really great execution, for the most part!Look at the game. I don't think I need to say much else. Sure, the game itself is awesome, but the visuals are a big part of what makes it stand out.The biggest strength in the combat is how the game is physics driven, but not like most of the lazy games that use a default physics engine with no consideration for gameplay. No no no, Apotheon uses physics almost perfectly, making the combat feel very impactful, and the general game is very satisfying to play. Platforming is cool, but above that is how you can break virtually everything, and the corpse ragdoll effects are really fun to play with!Beautiful lighting system! Simple, but it's still very nicely done. And it's used as a gameplay tool as well, so it's not just something to look pretty.Regarding the visuals, I think they went a bit overboard with the visual effects. Most of them were unnecessary and actually taken away from the whole ""ancient pottery"" aesthetic it has going for it. Looks a bit too polished and sparkly for pottery. But hey, it's still really unique!I was a bit disappointed with the story... It was very linear, and... ""original"". In this case, however, original isn't good.Drawing for mythology, there are tons of stories worth telling. What they've done, is simply to draw from the pantheon and some of the Gods' relationships, and made a betrayal/revenge story of their own, about a human who kills Gods... meh. Honestly, I expected things to be a bit different. Oh well.The combat can be a bit clunky, at times, because physics. Still feels very nice to send corpses flying around and throwing javellins at innocent Gods.Definitely give this one a go! Could have been better, story-wise, but the game itself is brilliant. Lots of different approaches and little mechanics that are barely used, but that you're free to explore. Awesome game!			"

												The first thing probably everyone will notice is how amazing this game looks. It's certainly a main reason why I've bought it. And what makes it even better is an amazing soundtrack which breathes with mythology and epicness. The one thing that could and should be better visually vise is terrain. At least some parts, like the thin ones designed for vertical traversal. Those are just thin black lines and it looks really weird.But what about the game mechanics? Well, they are ok.It's a 2D game and the maps are usually both very horizontal and vertical. The traversing through the map isn't always without problems. Sometimes when you for example jump on a ladder the game won't notice that it's a ladder and you won't be able to climb it. There are these slim terrain parts which are there for you to change your vertical position (I obviously don't know how to explain it), by jumping while holding the Down key. Which isn't really that responsive, especially in combat.The combat it self is just a click fest, even though you have a stamina which will deplete quickly. I think that they imagined the combat to by more tactical but I don't think that they've managed to do it. Main reason is the problem of the enemy AI with navigation on the map. If there is a vertical traversal or a jump sequence then they'll run around like crazy (especially the animals). You can block, use different types of attack based on the mouse movement and roll around. It certainly can look good if there isn't too much of a chaos. But more often than not I had to just click attack button like a mad man.The item progression is a particularly good one. There is a ton of different types of melee and ranged weapons, shields, armor parts, and special items like bombs, creature summons, healing and invisibility potions, the list goes on. There are a lot of special, mythical, weapons.The way the armor works is kinda weird. You have few armor parts which increase your maximum armor. When enemies are hitting you, the armor goes down and after it reaches zero they'll start to attack your hit points. Then you can either fix your armor with Repair kit or destroy items (boxes, vases, whatever) and find armor points like this. There are limits for how many of each items you can carry which honestly I don't understand. The main problem with items and combat is that the weapons can break down. And they'll break down really fast. It's not unusual that while you are fighting with few enemies three of your weapons will break down (because all of them were used previously) and you'll just see how every few seconds you have different kind of weapon in your hand. One moment you have short knife so you are right next to the enemy and suddenly you have 5 kilometers long spear in your hand and you can't hit him. I really don't understand reasons for this. And I don't think it fits with the mythology theme. There is a book written about you, great hero fighting gods and every third sentence is about how you have to switch weapon because another one had broken down?I don't know if I'll ever finish this game (I have played it for 7-8 hours so far, don't look at the hours steam is showing, I was waiting for trading cards:D) because Dragon's Dogma just came out and I don't find the story of Apotheon interesting. There isn't much of a story telling. You'll get few objectives and you can read few lines here and there about the gods. In the few lines of monologues, you can see their different personalities, and that's great. And I have to add that some of those objectives are really creative or at least interesting. So you are just playing around with these average mechanics while looking at a beautiful piece of art.It's an interesting, beautiful looking game. I would like to see more, but with fleshed out mechanics. The UX could be better, the fighting system should be better, the map traversing should be better, the story telling should be better. Then it could really be an amazing experience. Now, if it would be without its visuals it would be an average game, with those visuals it can't be average but it isn't that much fun to play for a longer time.Buy it on sale.			"

You could screenshot any given moment of this game, and it'd look great. But the fighting feels shallow. You stab and block blindly against foes that feel incorporeal. You can switch to other weapons, theoretically, but it's so cumbersome that I'd prefer not to.  And your weapons wear out, which everyone loves in their metroidvania games, right? And of course there's no controller support. Why would there be?A for the art, C- for everything else.			"

												REVIEW 2. (playtime 4h)I had only played the intro. After that the difficulty goes up, and you get to choose between Warrior and Champion (if you want to go even more difficult). The game explains very little about what the goal of some boss/mini-boss battles is exactly, but it's easy to find out and you always just restart before the battle/mini-game without penalty. (so losing a few times isn't that frustrating, wasting arrows can be frustrating though)I'm still in the ""OMG, the pottery graphics are beautiful""-phase, and it is a very enjoyable phase. The story is not very interesting, but it doesn't have to be (at least for a philhellenic like me!), the environment and the quotations as well as the broad range of challenges keep the game interesting.Negative points:This game definitely suffers from AITKS (Arrow-In-The-Knee Syndrome) some of the NPC lines get really annoying when hearing them for the umptieth time. It's mainly the Agora market voices (since that is where I have to return to all the time)REVIEW 1. (playtime: 0.5h)Only just got this game.It's absolutely beautiful.The beginning was really easy (too easy), maybe I just need to find the difficulty slider (haven't searched yet).			"

												This has been amazing. From the very beginning it feels a bit like a giant hand reaches up from history to drag one down through space and time and out of dimension. The art work is so well researched and reapplied it really gives you a feel for the mindset of the ancient greeks. The story unfolds like an classical epic, telling the story of a man defying the gods, but it has some elements of surprise. Also the soundtack and voice acting is excellent.The gameplay isn't too easy and there are two difficulties and one to unlock at the end. I recommend using controller, because with keyboard it is very hard not to become frustrated. There are some features that work much better with controller. There have been a few bugs, that appeared and vanished with every restart, but the game is totally worth the trouble if you enjoy something new and different from all the other games. I will certainly play it again just to study all the details.			"

												One of the best games I have played in a long time. You start off as a villager who's village is under attack after being cursed by the gods. Once you defeat the attackers, Hera sends you to Olympus to defeat all the gods. What happens afterwards is up to you. Very well written game with lots of action, great graphics, and yes you have to use your brain a lot. I highly recommend this game for any fan of rpgs. Well done.			"

												Apotheon is a platformer with an ancient Greek theme.  It is a very unique-looking game with an art style matching ancient Greek pottery.  You play a regular person, tasked with defeating the gods (led by Zeus of course) who have chosen to destroy humanity.  It's one of those games that shows how well thorough theming can work.  Everything about it is ancient Greek and well-researched to provide the best experience possible.While the game may be a platformer, it deviates quite a lot from the norm.  You have a wide range of ancient Greek weaponry to choose from with various melee and thrown weapons as well as quite a few types of arrows and sling ammunition.  Weapons are realistically modeled so you must actually hit enemies with the blade in order to damage them and both you an enemies can use shields to block attacks.  While it may feel clumsy at first with long attack windups, you quickly get used to it.  The one major problem with the combat is that attacks are performed either overhead, underhand, or stabbing, but the game selects one at random when you attack.  This can cause a lot of incorrect attacks that miss your target and lead to some frustration.The other major annoyance in the game is the movement.  While for the most part the platforming works fine, and the game even provides a ledge-climbing mechanic for when the jump is slightly too high, maintaining speed while running across a map is nearly impossible.  You speed up as you run but any time the slope of the ground changes, such as when you start climbing stairs, you lose all momentum.  In some places you can actually skip the stairs by jumping and land on another piece of ground of the same slope as you jumped from to maintain speed but very few locations offer that opportunity.  The game would have been better served by leaving out this feature altogether.The game is structured in a non-linear way with several hub areas branching into areas with multiple objectives you have to complete before continuing.  It gives the game more freedom to allows for mini quests that take place across several areas.  It also allows easy access to go back to previous areas to find secrets you missed and complete achievements.  Each area is themed for a specific ancient Greek god while the hub areas act as towns, complete with town guards who will attack you if you break the law.I was greatly surprised when I discovered that this game which I thoroughly enjoyed was made by the same developers as Capsized, a game which I found frustrating and poorly designed.  I hope they continue to make games of this quality in the future.			"

												Swords and Sandals clash with Metroidvania style gameplay! From the moment I started playing the game I was into it.Greek mythology is ripe for good storytelling. With its unique artstyle, crafting and intense combat. Apotheon is a game that deserves far more attention then it is getting. Now that isn't to say there isn't kinks in the armor of Apotheon. The game didn't detect my Logitech controller. Also the game has some minor annoying bugs to squash. However these bugs are miniscule in comparison to the game. Like Zeus on top of his mountain. I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												You don't need a review to tell you that the art style is amazing. The story is simple enough: kill the Olympian gods.Pros:- fun combat- excellent level design- diverse enemies and NPC cast- minor RPG elements such as leveling up individual armour pieces, which all have cool unique appearances- great diversity of weapon types that offer different gameplay styles, as well as some cool legendary weapons- soothing and mood-fitting soundtrack- great length/content (I've played for almost 4 hours and I've only killed one of the major Gods)- a ton of Greek myth references, great for myth buffs and anyone who has an interest in learningCons:- enemies in melee combat are difficult to hit when they are very close to the player- not necessarily a bad thing, but some may find the lack of character development underwhelming- boss battles don't seem very tough (granted I've only killed Apollo and some minor bosses such as the Chimera so far)I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Greek myth, but it is enjoyable enough that I would recommend it if you know nothing of Greek myth.

												I dont gush over games very often, in fact, Im a fairly cynical gamer, but Apotheon is awesome.  This is a gem that almost slipped under my radar (thank you, Steam sale), and I am very grateful it didnt because it's an example to me of what all game design should aspire to: great art style, great music, great voice acting, great game play, great writing, great design and fun, fun, fun!  The combat was a little clunky for me at first, but when I got used to it I realized it's actually quite skill-based and more sophisticated than I had at first thought.  The story is clever and well-written; as a fan of greek mythology, I was happy to see the research that went into the game and how well the designer's captured the personalities of the gods based on descriptions found in the classics.  The art style is unique and did a beautiful job of capturing the theme.  I am very surprised at how good this game is and I recommend it to everyone.  Easily my favorite 2d platformer ever and well worth the $$.  Well done Alientrap on giving this game the polish all games deserve but rarely get.			"

												Apotheon is a reasonably good ""Metroidvania""-style game. The main pulling factor for this game is definately the Artstyle. So the flowchart for this game is pretty simple: Do you like the Artstyle? Yes: buy / No: don't buyOverall the gameplay is mostly fluid and satisfying. The Stages are varied and follow appropriate themes. The game manages to set the mood just right, eventho the appalingly British voiceactors do their best to brake this immersion. Controles can be a bit wonky at times, but on gamepad it's generally managable. It is somewhat prone to glitch at times, this goes from +5 HP apples ragdolling into a pillar and being unreachable to important quest items getting lost in a similar way(or down mount olympus). The story is ok, good enough to be a game, or greek myth. One thing that I personally liked a lot is that some typical tropes were avoided, like Hades being all evil. Also having Hera as Patron was both a reasonable and refreshing choice. I did notice they forgot to include poor Hestia. Which is a pitty as she is always left out because everyone thinks ""the twelve Olympians"" includes Hades, who lives in... Hades. Finished on easy with all sidequests, lacking some ""secret chests"" in about 15 hours.			"

												This recommendation comes with some caution. Apotheon is a beautiful game and its soundtrack and environments are magical and immersive. The game is SUPER aesthetically pleasing, from its use of Attic Black-Figure pottery style, to the faux-ceramic texture of the screen (scratches and ribbing, which is the result of throwing pottery on a wheel, included!), to the beautiful use of color, light, and shadows. However, the game mechanics suck. A lot. It can get frustrating and downright annoying.If you're looking for a new, relatively cheap but visually stunning game, I would recommend Apotheon. Also, if you have a background in Classical history or archaeology (like me), this game becomes even more delightful, as there are excerpts from Hesiod and Homer, and all of the gods were clearly designed with their ancient depictions in mind. Just keep in mind the terrible mechanics.			"

												What an absolute marvel!Outstanding art, precise mechanics, engrossing story.The best game I have ever purchased for $5I absolutely love this game.The aesthetics with upgradable armor: The different armor types and how they look on your character: cloth, leather, metallic. The weapon variety: Dori, Sarissa, Xiphos, Sagaris, Bows etc. There are even unique weapons that do different capabilities, like the Hydra bow that shoots 3 projectiles instead of one. Interesting take on the different shields: The game does not stick to the traditional Hoplon, but tweaks it in a variety of different ways to better fit your play style, (reflect damage, or see in the dark) The mechanics: How the sarissa (long pike) only deals damage where the spearhead is, not the shaft; so when you go to thrust, anything in a close proximity is unscathed. The story: Amazing rendition of classic Hellenistic deities and a unique path to follow.SPOILER  Though it is very similar to the God of War archetype. This game is a gem. "

												GTA: Ancient GreeceBut seriously, this game is a wonderful sidescroller with stunning visuals and a fully fleshed out storyline that will appeal to everyone (but especially Classics nerds). Though not a sandbox, you can take a break from your goals in order to explore the world and locate secret treasure troves, mines and other goodies. You will spend equally as much time solving puzzles as you will in combat, so you don't have to brawl constantly unless that's how you want to get your kicks.The fighting mechanics can be a little buggy, and might be best tackled with the use of a controller - or by grinding for a few hours in the woods or in Hades and mastering your aim. However, this didn't take anything away from my enjoyment of the game overall.  10/10 would smack Appollo in the face with an axe again.			"

												TL;DR Apotheon has become one of my favorite games in my Steam library.A lot of reviews call this game a Metroidvania, I however, do not think it quite falls into that category. To me, it was more of a side-scrolling action RPG. Metroidvanias tend to lock advancement through abilities, Apotheon is gated through objectives. While you can earn new equipment and (some) do grant new abilities, you do not gain access to new areas through these assets. Equipment, namely weapons and shields, have durability and you must replace them as you face combat. Armour, on the other hand, acts as a buffer to your health and can be increased permanently by buying/finding new pieces. You can also increase your attack speed and damage with the various weapon types by paying a skill trainer.The story is well written and, from what I understand, is very accurate to the personality and positions of the gods. It is a unique story, I believe, so just knowing their legends won't spoil the experience for you. It was a very atmospheric game, and I very much felt alone against the gods. While these games won't quite warrant comparison in a gameplay sense, it brought to me memories  reminiscient of Morrowind and Dark Souls, with it's patient yet frantic combat and well-designed atmosphere. The dialogue of even minor characters really grips you, and snipets of the legends of the gods scattered throughout on little statuettes wrap the whole package together quite nicely.Quests were quite varied, even going so far as to introduce new mechanics temporarily just to mix up the formula and keep the game interesting. This was very refreshing and kept the game from feeling redundant or tedius.It's not without it's cons. I played through entirely on normal difficulty and, while some battles did present somewhat of a challenge, I found it quite easy because of the abundance of new shields and healing items. I never lacked for protection, and armour upgrades seemed to come quickly. There is the option shortly after the introduction to increase the difficulty and I wish I'd done so right away. It is also worth mentioning that, after game completion, an Olympian difficulty is unlocked.The physics can, at times, also act a little wonky. This is not a spritegrid-based physics system, and things can act a little rag-dolly. Every once in a while I'd take a hit that would send me flying across the area just because of how it connected. After you get use to the physics of the game this isn't really a hinderance, but worth mentioning. It can make some fights take a little longer than necessary.I'll end this review with some tips for new players, mechanics the game doesn'tmake obvious:-Saves DO NOT work by slot! The most recent save is always at the top of the list. Be careful when overriding as your save may not be quite where you expect it to be in the list.-While you may aim with the mouse/right stick, the direction of the LEFT stick can change the type of melee attack you perform with the weapon.-Using the throw button IS NOT a quick button for your equipped ranged weapon, but will instead throw your currently equipped melee weapon. Useful for surprising enemies and ditching weapons low on duraility.			"

												Apotheon is an excellent 2D platformer. The gameplay is fun with a variety of melee, ranged and special weapons and some looting, crafting etc... There's quite a pleasing variety of levels and objectives, so that you don't just have to run around from point A to point B. But where the game really stands out, is on graphics quality. It is gorgeous. The designers have done an outstanding job into transforming the Ancient Greek art into a living world. Often in the game I paused to admire the beautiful surroundings and the NPCs, it felt like the art of an amphora had just sprung to life.Where this game is missing out is on the storyline. The idea of the main quest is ridiculous but I'm kinda fine with that... What wasn't clear was how my hero, a protector of men ended up slaying everyone indiscriminately, looting their houses etc... It was my choice you'd say, but some of the quests/achievements cannot be completed otherwise, and some areas will be left inaccessible. Which brings me to my last point, that even though it feels great that it's an open world game, I was some times lost on what I have to do next to progress some of the side quests.Overall, a fantastic idea and a great execution from the Alieantrap team!

												I bought this game completely on a whim and can't sing its praises highly enough. The artwork is fantastic with its warm glow and nod to the ancient Greek style and that sets you up nicely for what is an engaging journey up Mount Olympus. I'm still in the early stages of the game (running a Let's Play, link below for those interested) but have to say I'm impressed by the depth I've seen so far for a 2D side-scroller. Many people have said this before but it does have similarities to God of War but I do think there's more depth to it. There's even an educational element to the game for those with absolutely no clue about Greek mythology (like me!). For the relatively modest price the game is set at, this is a worthy purchase, particularly, if like me, you're looking for something a bit different. Enjoy! Apotheon Playthrough!  "

												What i liked:The story (a little bit nichilistic but not bad, God of War like).The art (exept the fact you always have the shield in the hand facing you, they could have keept the left hand for it)The gameplay is not bad but i don't like the fact you can breathe underwater and the weapon damage system. Nor i liked that my character  could carry so many weapons, i prefer the multiplayer system in wich you can have a weapon at time. Some weapons coud be more fast and when running you should not slow down so much at stairs.The combat could be better and more accurate, maybe allowing to chose between point or slash or allowing to charge the hit (Mount and Blade like, but 2D)What i didn't liked: Crashed sometimes (but savegames were ok). There is only campaign and multiplayer, something more would have been better. There is almost no reward for exploring, or doing sidequests, or killing a strong enemy. What this game needs: mod support and a War of Troy mod. I would have preferred some moral system and some choices in this game. I mean, you can be chaotic or almost good (until you start killing the gods), it would be nice to see some different outcome, according to your behavior.I hope the 2 will be much better, since for now i liked the game for what it can be.

												An almost Souls-like experience, Apotheon follows Nikandreos, lead by Hera as he slaughters everyone on Olympus one by one, and sometimes house by house, eventually usurping Zues himself. Refuge or god, none are safe from Nikandreos' primal rage as he fights to avenge a quite literally god-forsaken humanity.  A suprisingly varied experience as brilliant in aesthetic as it is in satisfaction from start to finish. I do reccomend playing on the harder difficulty on your first playthrough to get the most out of this game. The lower difficulty leaves you with far too many resources and breathing room. You are killing gods after all, prove yourself worthy to walk upon the Olympian summit. One thing to note about this game is that a lot of your learning is done in a heavily autodidactic fashion. Such little tidbits will follow. Semi spoiler alert relating to the specifics of combat. 1: Sweeping an enemies feet out will throw them into the air.2: Hitting them in the head with your swing will do more damage.3: When blocking, you need to aim your shield at the point of which the attack will impact with you. This is particularly needed in the final fight. 4: If you get into a fight with guards around the 'non-combat' areas, either run as far as you can and hide. (The top left of the screen shows you portraits of who you are in combat with, and will fade away if they lose you.) But if you choose to fight, make sure you don't let them blow their horns. They will summon more dudes to fight and can do this endlessly.5: Middle mouse while blocking to do a shield smack, knocking people back and putting their guard down. 6: Stackable weapons durabilities are individual to that weapon. For example, if you have a spear in your hand it's durability isn't shared with the other 4 hidden on your person. 7: When breaking open stuff, if you have the time switch to your fist not to waste durability on weapons. That's all that comes to mind right now just after finishing the game. I would love to see a similar style game but for Norse mythology instead of Greek. It would be brilliant. Absolutely reccomend this game for fans of souls games type combat.			"

												A simple Metroidvania game with a relatively unique combat system and an amazing soundtrack. Despite the heavily under-utilized exploration elements, the game nails the rest of its components and was an enjoyable play. Easily recommended for fans of the Metroidvania genre; if you are new to this genre, you can start with this game but there are a few better choices out there (notably Guacamelee).PROS:-Amazing soundtrack.-Solid voice acting.-Simple metroidvania concept with varied environments, hidden areas, and breakable walls.-Different weapons feel different. -Unique artstyle. This style has the possibility of being an eyesore or making certain components difficult to see, but this was not the case at all with Apotheon. NEUTRALS:-2 game world hubs. Cannot access the second hub until you clear the first hub which somewhat limits speed run or ""alternate path"" run throughs. However, within the given hubs, they can be cleared in any order from the start. -Breakable objects mostly pointless. Only ""meaningful"" collectible is gold which is used to get damage upgrades but not really needed.-Enemies are mostly pointless. I found myself simply running past most of them towards the second half of the game, especially after I had level 3 attack upgrades. -Way too many health/armor drops. I had max inventory almost all game.CONS:-No meaningful abilities gained (giving access to new areas).-No consideration for additional access in level design.-Heavily under-utilize exploration elements.**This is especially odd given it is a Metroidvania game, but, aside from armor, you gain no abilities that give you access to new areas. This is quite strange because you DO get the ability to  roll in mid-air  which could have been used to give access to many new game areas but....the environments/levels are not designed in this way.-Does not properly support side mouse buttons (not a big deal). 1 of my 2 side buttons did work, but only certain abilities (I ended up using it for throw, but it would not work for roll even though it would bind).

												The game's art style, first of all, is fantastic. I won't go into detail about that here because it's been talked about a lot already. The other things I liked were the open world elements of the game- you can go back and revisit nearly every area if you want. It's possible to beat the game in a pretty short amount of time if you don't do any of the non-essential side quests and activities, but all of these are fun and often give you extra powers. The combat has been compained about quite a bit, and this brings me to my next point: if you have really bad framerates, it's not very fun. Because of the nature of combat- very timed, not button mashing, directonal, etc- it's a challenge. I was getting ~20fps from my laptop, and that was no fun. However, once I started playing on my desktop PC, it was far more enjoyable. The combat is love-it-or-hate-it, I suppose, but I found it engaging and rather difficult. Most of the boss battles are great, as well. Storyline? It's kind of a standard ancient tale, I guess. Not much, to be honest, and your charcter never speaks. The deities are accurate in their personalities. Overall, I highly recommend Apotheon for its amazing visual quality, refined combat, limited RPG elements, and atmosphere.			"

												GTA: Ancient GreeceBut seriously, this game is a wonderful sidescroller with stunning visuals and a fully fleshed out storyline that will appeal to everyone (but especially Classics nerds). Though not a sandbox, you can take a break from your goals in order to explore the world and locate secret treasure troves, mines and other goodies. You will spend equally as much time solving puzzles as you will in combat, so you don't have to brawl constantly unless that's how you want to get your kicks.The fighting mechanics can be a little buggy, and might be best tackled with the use of a controller - or by grinding for a few hours in the woods or in Hades and mastering your aim. However, this didn't take anything away from my enjoyment of the game overall.  10/10 would smack Appollo in the face with an axe again.			"

												Apotheon is an excellent 2D platformer. The gameplay is fun with a variety of melee, ranged and special weapons and some looting, crafting etc... There's quite a pleasing variety of levels and objectives, so that you don't just have to run around from point A to point B. But where the game really stands out, is on graphics quality. It is gorgeous. The designers have done an outstanding job into transforming the Ancient Greek art into a living world. Often in the game I paused to admire the beautiful surroundings and the NPCs, it felt like the art of an amphora had just sprung to life.Where this game is missing out is on the storyline. The idea of the main quest is ridiculous but I'm kinda fine with that... What wasn't clear was how my hero, a protector of men ended up slaying everyone indiscriminately, looting their houses etc... It was my choice you'd say, but some of the quests/achievements cannot be completed otherwise, and some areas will be left inaccessible. Which brings me to my last point, that even though it feels great that it's an open world game, I was some times lost on what I have to do next to progress some of the side quests.Overall, a fantastic idea and a great execution from the Alieantrap team!

												Apotheon took me about 14 hours to complete. The controls were great, the story was interesting and the weapon variety made the combat fun. The art style looked cool throughout the game. The only issue I had was that once you threw all of one type of weapon (ex spears) it just swaps to the next and you can keep throwing. There were serveral times I threw every sword, axe, etc before I realized I was out of spears. Veni, vidi, vici!  I think thats Latin for I came, I saw, I kicked it's♥♥♥♥♥(?) Update - It looks like they have released a free online multiplayer version that you could download and play to see if this is a game you might like. I haven't tried the multiplayer, but the not free story mode was great!			"

												A sort of metroidvania style adventure taking place in Ancient Greece in a black-figure style reminiscent of Archaic period Greek pottery art; Apotheon is an extremely interesting and well thought out experience.The game has its flaws, certainly.  The combat system, while servicable is rather frantic, often you're flailing around trying to hit things rather than being able to decisively attack.  There are a large number of weapons... often too many, as there are no less than thirty different weapons at your disposal, most of which can be thrown as well as used at melee range, not to mention a wide variety of arrows.  This makes picking the right weapon for the job difficult at times, and as weapons tend to break (though you hardly ever find yourself NOT having one, as they're EVERYWHERE) you generally find yourself using whatever you have on hand.  Fortunately, this aspect DOES add to the feel of the game, as you're often pulling weapons off racks and hurling them at your attackers.  Quite often I've found satisfaction in hurling a short sword and embedding it in an enemy footman's forehead.The power-ups are useful but none of them (until the final one, at least) are spectacular so the power up curve is very slight and almost imperceptible.  The enemies get harder and you get tougher, but the game never really seems to get any more or less difficult.  Depending on what you like, this can be a good or a bad thing, but I found it to be fortunate as the game never became a slog.There are a lot of puzzles and interesting little gimmicks in the game that aren't really overused.  Many of the boss fights are unique and interesting and each god's area is flavored by their domain and personality appropriately.  If you are a fan of Greek mythology (or even have a passing knowledge) you should enjoy the references and there's also a ton of little blurbs from various ancient Greecian literature to flavor the events of the game.As the game progressed, I found it to grow progressively more unstable, crashing several times near the end.  However, this was never more than a momentary irritation as checkpoints are numerous and the game has an autosave/continue system as well as a manual save should you need them.All in all, a solid and entertaining piece of work.  I'm not sure if I'll try to beat it on anything other than the default difficulty, but I did find all the lockboxes and I completed MOST of the sidequests so there's a lot of fun to be had.  It's definitely worth its time and Zeus and the other gods are compelling enough to keep you going until the end just to stick it to them.			"

												Very enjoyable experience with some minor issues. It definitely has one of the finest art-style I've seen and gameplay wise it's also great, but there are some things that would be welcome in sequel if that ever happens. It's definitely not one of those Art >> Gameplay situations. Premise is really simple and quite similar to God of War games - Ancient Greek mythology + overthrowing godsYou have a wide range of weapons at your disposal and combat involves attacking and blocking/dodging. Nothing complicated, it just works. Would be great if there would be light/medium/charged attack system (instead weapons themselves replace this system) or better directional attack system. Weapons lose durability over time so when your favourite fiery sword reaches 0, it's gone.There are numerous destroyable objects, that can contain ether health/armor replenishers, ingredients for crafting potions/bombs or weapons. However if you destroy these objects with your weapon, durability is lost which is a bit annoying. You can still break everything with your fists so gameplay-wise disabling durability loss when not attacking enemies would be much better than just cycling between primary weapon and fists.You can't repair items, but plenty are lying around and you can easily buy them (rare weapons are actually more easily acquirable, since every time you find a rare weapon/shield, it's added to stock). Buying things from black market merchant also involves the biggest bug in the game - If you unlock enough rare weapons, you can't see bottom items when trying to buy from black market merchant (at least on 1366x768)Feeling of the game itself is entirely positive. It looks perfect for the setting you are in and it's not repetitive. Locations differ and feel unique from each other. And it's not just looks, gameplay/platforming differs in each location. Some acquired powers/gifts from the gods however feel a bit uninspiring. Who cares about +X % when using potion trait?Multiple secrets that gives you a bit of a boost in your journey. Some feel a bit disappointing, but who does not like hunting for secret locations?Super minor, but a really smart element in the game - when you collect new armor, you can change to previous look if you don't like the new one without sacrificing stats.Achievements are gathered as you play along + side objectives, so there are no ""Kill 12 wolves in 1 second"" medalsIn conclusion - an instant recommendation, feels like AAA platformer with some polish would make this an AAA+			"

												Enjoyable, challenging and educational. In fact, I think I learned more about Greek mythology from this game than all the books I read on the subject as a kid. It took me a while to get used to the weapon switching mechanics, which are a little clumsy and could probably have been done better, but I had hours of fun playing this and didn't want it to end (and a fantastic ending it is too). Well worth it.			"

												I have so far gotten to what I assume is the halfway point of the game, if not the second third, and I can already say that this game is worth the price (even though I only got it for $3 over on Humble Bundle)The story is basic, but enough to keep you engaged. This game takes place during the times dypicted in Ancient Greek Mythology (if you haven't learned much about it, you can get a basic idea from the Disney movie, Hercules, since you don't need to know much to be familiar with the lore this game covers). You play as Nikandreos, a warrior who is sent by Zeus' wife, Hera, to climb Mount Olympus and destroy the gods that abandoned mankind. Like I said, there isn't much to the story, but it does give you the motivation to pursue the task at hand.The presentation is very well done. The artstyle perfectly replicates the artwork of ancient greek, both in environments and characters. Just a quick heads up, however, that the artstyle matches a bit TOO well; like ancient greek artwork, character models and environmental statues and paintings will feature nudity, such as genitalia (both the male and female variety) and breasts, so if you don't like seeing that sort of thing, it's best to tread lightly. Rest assured, however, that it does not go any further than that. I also like some of the more subtle details, such as the glossy shine that follows your mouse, implying that the game is played out on a clay pot or jar similar to most ancient artwork of the time.Gameplay is just about what you expect from a Metroidvania: Expansive levels with numerous secret passageways and goodies to find, special abilities that you can unlock as you defeat more gods of Olympus, and the ability to take on the objectives you are given in any order. What makes the game a bit more unique, however, is the weapon and crafting system. To any Anti-Minecraft people out there, don't worry, crafting is neither required or even complex; there's only a handful of items you can craft, such as your basic potions and bombs, as well as consumable weapons like traps. The weapon system is also unique; unlike most other Metroidvania games, you're not just stuck to one weapon, with there being numerous weapons to find ranging from knives, arrows, spears, swords, and sheilds, with each type having their own varied range of weapons; some weapons do high damage when used a certain way, others have elemental abilities like burning damage, and some even provide explorative uses, such as lighting your way through dark areas. It's a bit like Dark souls in that regard, as you also have to keep in mind that some weapons are heavier than others, meaning they have slow attack rates but high damage capability. It's also worth noting that all weapons have stamina, meaning they break after significant use. Thankfully, though, you can purchase any weapons or sheilds you find in the field via the black market, so getting your favorite weapon back isn't too much of an issue if you have the gold to purchase it.Overall, I can easily call this one of my favorite Metroidvanias so far. It may not be as good as Ori or Dust, but it does what it intends to do very well.			"

												This game does a great job of bringing Greek mythology to life. The art, music, story, and level design tied together to create a compelling experience that felt like something Homer wrote. The game also does a good job with pacing; it's doesn't take too much time to feel like you've made a decent amount of advancement in it. I have two critiques of the game. First, the controls are a little awkward. The fights usually feel pretty epic, but if you stop too close to an enemy it gets really weird as your weapon swings go right past each other. Second, the inventory screen is a little cumbersome and keeps track of unnecessary things like obsolete armor types. Overall, I'd give this game a solid B+.			"

There was exploring, racing, and puzzles to boot. Tons of items, equipment, and recipes. Finding new stuff in hidden areas felt rewarding but didnt make you overpowered, not an empty collectathon like many games. Worth full price, and an absolute steal when it goes on sale. Cons? hmm combat could be a little more fleshed out, they tried to give you a lot of different options and approaches (weapon types, ranged combat, sheild variations, potions that buff you in different ways) but honestly wacking things works for most enemeis. There is some enemy variation, but most you just wack them when they arent sheilding and they die. Not a huge complaint as the combat is still very fun, but if you play it for too long it could get a little repetitive			"

Queen Hera plans to overthrow her husband, Zeus, but in order to do that, she needs your power.And just like that, you are thrown into the gigantic arena that is Olympus to hust down, slay, and defeat every god that stands in your way, each god you kill, the more power you gain so you can even rival the mighty Zeus.The game has a very unique fighting system that doesn't make the game too difficult, but very attractive and engaging, like Aphrodite.The art of Apotheon is very original and different from any other greek mythology based game. It resembles the color schenes and the figures portrayed on ancient greek pottery. It is very appealing to see these stationary orange and black figures come to life from their painted forms.The music is very engaging and ""godlike."" (See what I did there?) It helps make the boss battles more intense so that the bosses seem mostrous and terifying.8/10 I am just playing all of the games I bought but never played for years.			"

												I absolutely love the concept of this game, particularly the brilliant art style (inspired by Classical Greek pottery) and the use of real mythology to weave together an original storyline. The voice acting is pretty good, which is rare for a video game. I also love that it was created by such a small team.Drawbacks: The controls were pretty wonky, which was normally fine but made some of the battles and other obstacles unnecessarily difficult--and not in a ""challenging"" way, just in a frustrating way. (I like what they were trying to do with the controls, it just didn't seem as well executed as it could be) The graphics also struggled, even if I greatly reduced the resolution. Both of these problems could just be my computer though; it's not the fastest.This isn't a drawback for me, but if you are squeamish in any way, this is not a game for you. It's very dark, bloody, and violent, and there is a lot of nudity--of course, without any of that, it would be missing the point of the mythological inspiration.Overall, vey well done and definitely worth playing!

												Very nice and addictive RPG platformer. I loved the variety of quests, freedom, voices and atmosphere. Bossfights were also really good. But I was sometimes frustrated with a little bit high difficulty and chaotic fights. I really recommend this gem. It took me about 8 hours to finish the game, so it isnt short at all.			"

												I was instantly drawn to this game,  more than a year before it released, when I saw its art style, and the combat looked right up my alley as well.  I can say with certainty that it was worth the wait.Combat is timing-based, and depending on what weapon you're using timing will change, as will the damage per swing.  Some enemies may be fast enough that certain types of weapons won't land a hit, so you'd better be able to think on your feet.  As for weapons, there are a LOT of them, with decent variety in playstyle.  There is also a crafting system for health items, fire jars, temporary speed, and other such powerups, giving you good reason to seek out all the little pick-up-ables that can be found amoungst pots, jars, and crates.The world is *large*, open, and PACKED with locked doors and little dungeons.  Definitely in the ""Metroid-vania"" genre.  As a completionist, I'm wondering how in the world I'll finish this game, with those tantalizing little ""X-out-of-Z chests unlocked"" indicators teasing me - so many locked doors to remember to open.The hub world is interesting, having a group of ""police"" that you'll need to avoid whilst you lock-pick into merchant's houses in search of loot, or try to take that tempting little statue.  You'll want to run and hide until your alert meter cools off if you're seen being a trouble maker, lest you be first warned with a fine of 20 gold, then straight up executed if you're caught again not long after.Boss fights are satisfying, music is fitting, story is fun.  Fair disclaimer though, I'm not finished yet, so I can't say if I like the ending.If I have one complaint about the game itself, it might be that the voice acting is perhaps the only thing not fully fitting with the style (it's not BAD, it's just not as ""Greek"" feeling as the rest of the game is), as it might be more enjoyable to just have text bubbles and imagine the voices.  Still, the speaking is good for the lazy who prefer not to read.The other complaint I have, though not down to the game itself, and more about the programming, is that this game seems to be a bit more intensive than it should be, and feels just a bit laggy, despite being a 2D platformer type of game.  Perhaps it wouldn't be an issue if I weren't playing on an iMac, but Bioshock Infinite didn't complain too badly.Overall, this game is a solid 9/10 for me; certainly one of the best 2D games I've ever played.++++++++++++++++++++Edit: I'm about halfway through the game now at 23 hours in.   I'm going pretty completionist, so I'm getting all the chests and such.  I have to say, the sheer number of weapons, items, powerups, etc is nuts.  Boss fights have been very fun, particularly Artimis.  The voice acting bothers me less now, seems to be the case that a few early voices just sounded weird to me.Really looking forward to seeing how the endgame plays out.  Game is still a solid 9/10.++++++++++++++++++++Game is complete, 100%, all achievements, guards kneel and weep before me, etc, etc.  Game is ok, 1/10Pfft.  9/10.  Almost leaning 8/10 for the all the lag I got playing a 2D game, even on an imac, but I really can't fault the whole game for a bit of optimization problems.  Only real complaint I have looking back is that you end up with 1,000 weapons, but you really only want to use like 4 of them, and the rest start to feel like fluff.			"

												I don't really these 'reviews' that much, but I really felt like doing an exception for this masterpiece.To start with I have to mention the graphics of this game. Even though it's only a 2D platform game the graphics themselves are absolutely perfect. Done in a style of ancient greek paintings and mozaiques it unbelieveably matches the whole atmosphere of the game and is a pleasure to watch. Also each and every place you visit has a different atmosphere, from welcoming Agora of the Olympus, to hostile swamps under Artemis' realm, it really spices the game up and makes you feel you are still about to discover more and more unique locations, it never makes you bored.Another jewel of this game is the outstanding soundtrack composed by greek composer Marios Aristopoulos <3 . For each part of the Olympus (at which you operate in this game), or other destinations there is a different theme music which fits the nature of the place perfectly. When playing in the Hades' realm of the Underworld I was actually pretty scared solely because of the song playing in there.The story itself is very interesting as well and I really liked the differences between each of the numerous bosses appearing throughout the game as well as the unique ways of defeating them, every single one of them had a different approach and developers of this game really took everything they could and used every opportunity the 2D platform RPG game offered.For me as a lover of greek mythology this game earned it's place in my heart and I would really like to thank the developers for creating this game (not game a masterpiece within games!) and it pleases me that even in these times, some people are still passionate enough to make a game about the awesome greek mythology!I highly recommend Apotheon to everyone, this piece of art will just suck you in and won't let you out until you finish it and maybe not even then.That's it, thanks to the ones reading it this far and I hope that one day the 'gods in making games' at Alientrap will bring us something even more awesome than this, even though trumphing Apotheon will be an extremely hard task. :))			"

												So where to begin with this game.Well---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:+Great story, especially to those greek mythos lovers out there, such as myself. Makes you fan out to fight the Gods of Olympus.+Fun and creative gameplay.+Survivial (in a way), you pick up items on you're way, can buy items in stores, can trade items, but from as far as I can see, there is no selling weps or supplies.+Fun as hell bosses, and each boss sticks to a theme.+Some of the missions are hard as hell, but have great pay offs at the end.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mixed:~Music is pretty basic.~There is in fact voice acting for the text. But it varies, if anything, I hate how movie, tv shows, and video games do this stupid thing where they make everyone have a british accent. If I am playing a game about acient greek history, I would like thecorrect accent. It also switches off for some characters, going from british, to scotish, to an american accent.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:-I am sure I am not the only one who has said this.BUT GOOD LORD THIS GAME'S STORY IS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE ""GOD OF WAR"".You are a mortal who has been left for dead by Zeus, you aint gonna take that♥♥♥♥♥♥and go and hunt him down. Of course Zeus'sfollowers arent to happy so you have to kill them too.Good lord its like they took ""God of war's"" story and shoved it into one.Not to say ""God of war"" has a bad story, but there could be some more creativity into the story in ""Apotheon"".- Some of the game gets crazy, and pure unfair.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------So in conclusionIs this game bad? Hell no, it has its flaws but in the end the game is a great buy.My Rating: 7.5/10 "

I'm going to build my own Mount Olympus, with dice and courtesans!One by one, striking down ancient Gods, teaching them some humility and shoving arrogance back down their throats, you are the chosen champion - Nikandreos, who is marching through mythological Greek locations, trying to get some sweet justice. Sounds cliché, however the setting has an untapped potential which is used quite skillfully. Somehow it reminds me of the good old Tomb Raider - cold and empty halls of Poseidon temples, dark and ominous rivers of Hades, feeling of adventure and desolation.It does have issues - minor bugs here and there, open map edges where you can fall through textures, battle system could use some extra moves like parry, more enemy types. Nevertheless, it does seem to be polished and well-paced.Fairly simple and easy game with little secrets, rushed ending, but very educational, true to the source and truly an eye candy. And music... oh music is marvellous and very fitting, which will raise your hair as you approach your destiny and final battle. My heart is longing for more, but there are no alternatives, maybe it is time to fire up Titan Quest again?			"

												Visuals in this game are stunning, if you did not notice. And overall commitment to ancient greek theme is very commendable. The music is plesant, although one would say lo-fi. And the gameplay is typical for the ""metroidvania"" genre, with the accent on exploration, with relative freedom given to you. The game has a nice set of optional and sometimes hidden quests, finishing such usually grants you some benefits in the main one. Some little things are worth pointing out too. When you run for a while in one direction on a level ground, you start to sprint. This spices the usual tedious walks of the games in this genre. The controls and combat in particular can be very wonky and even random at times. And game overall could really benefit from more polish. There are a lot of bugs and glitches. As if there was little time put in testing. If you want to try this game and did not like the introductory level, i say try one more to get a better feel. The first linear level with such a strange and clunky controls can misderect you from the joy of this game. It's not perfect, but it us surely very fun to play. Boners.			"

												I was charmed to try the game by its unique art style that resembles Ancient Greek vase decorations, and I was glad to have tried the game. It's not just an artsy indie game, and the more you play, the better it gets.The game takes place almost entirely on Mt Olympus, and has you visit different areas. There are 2 main hub locations (Agora and Acropolis), and each one contains doorways to a number of other areas. Some of these areas belong to a specific deity, whilst others are just bonus locations. Most of the game's story involves you simply undertaking tasks for each Olympian deity and eventually confronting them one way or another.This is not just a simple 2D platformer. The game has quite an open world and really knows how to reward exploration. There are tonnes of optional areas and hidden secrets, and a huge variety of weapons to collect, many of which are uniques. There's always some delicious surprise around a corner or behind a breakable wall. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the Metroid style games, so if you've ever enjoyed those, you should have a fun time with Apotheon as well.Despite the enormous amount of fun I've had, I've also come across a lot of frustration, which was somewhat disappointing. As some people already pointed out, the combat, although fun and enjoyable, can be a bit tricky and awkward at times, because you have to time your swings really well. Not much of a problem most of the time, but it can be a nightmare when fighting fast moving enemies that either jump at you or fly around.There were some parts of the game where frustration came mostly from controls, such as trying to quickly outclimb the fast-rising flames of river Phlegethon, but most times it was in the boss fights. Although some bosses were a fun challenge, a fair few were frustrating beyond belief and involved mechanics which did not make much sense, like Diomedes being completely invulnerable unless you've thrown a jar of blood at him to stun him, or Zeus somehow being weak to his own lightning bolts, but managing to shrug off blades, clubs, and fire like they were nothing.Still, despite the frustrating sections, I've had a very fun playthrough. The music is also really fantastic and fits the areas perfectly. The most noteworthy one being the eerie track that plays in Hades. So for the most part, this is a really memorable and unique game. I would highly recommend you check it out if you've ever at least remotely enjoyed 2D platformers and sidescrollers.			"

												Funnily enough, a few weeks before learning about Apotheon for the first time, I had a similar idea for a Metroidvania-style game stylized to look like ancient artwork, only Egyptian-style instead of Greek. Not terribly relevant, just noting what got me enthused to play Apotheon in the first place.The basic premise of Apotheon is that Zeus has grown tired of mankind's continuous degeneration, and has decided to call do-over and wipe the Earth clean of mortalkind, and decrees that the gods of Olympus will withdraw their favor. Crops won' grow, sun won't shine, the forests are empty of game, etc. After fending off some desperate raiders in the opening tutorial, Hera bids you to travel to Olympus and take back what the gods have deprived your people of by force. One thing leads to another and you find yourself going head to head with Zeus himself in the climactic battle.Apotheon's being drawing point is definitely its artstyle. The entire game is made to look like Greek pottery art come to life, and it gives the game an identity all is own that serves the tone of the game perfectly. Gameplay wise there isn't much to talk about, pretty typical Metroidvania fare, and in the end I only have three major complaints:1. Weapon degradation has never improved a game. I imagine it was mostly added to force players to try out the different weapons in the game (there's a lot of them), but all it did was make me focus on using the worst weapons in my arsenal just so they'd break and get off the list. Breakable shields is more understandable, but generally speaking iron is slightly more sturdy than carboard and tinfoil.2. The game tends to take more than it gives, which made me resort to farming on more than a few occasions. Farming is for survival games and MMOs. Otherwise it just indicates poor resource distribution.3. The Caduceus of Hermes, while a fun exploration tool, also reveals a number of clumsy level borders, as the developers never intended those areas to be accessed. Many of these are one-way trips and can lead to falling out of the map entirely. I get the feeling the Caduceus was added to the game partway through development and the rest of the game wasn't built with it in mind.All in all these are only mild niggles in what is otherwise a beautiful and engaging Metroidvania title. Definitely give it a go.			"

Posted: May 17, 2015
												I have always had a mild interest in Greek culture, or more specifically, its mythology. It is some of the richest that I know, and some of the most entertaining, and this game does every bit of that storied culture proud. As far as I can tell, the setting described within this game is as spot on as one can get in regards to something first created thousands of years ago. The art style is amazing, I feel as if I  am fighting my way through my own Greek epic, my own legend, and the music captures that feeling even more, and honestly, the whole display would not look at all out of place on a urn or carving in a museum. When just wandering Olympus, the sound of Pipes and Lyres fill the world, but when Xiphos and Doru are drawn, out come the horns and battle drums, not to mention a chorus to build up the tension. While the style and display are among the best I have ever seen, the actual gameplay and writing technique fall slightly short. The writing itself is fine, but aside from our silent hero Nikandreos, there are few, if any, returning characters to beef up dialog. When your home village of Dion is attacked, there is little impact to seeing a Greek village engulfed in flames. Characters run around screaming the same few lines over and over again, and even the characters that do speak rarely show up again, and if they do, it is unlikely you will remember any of them. Even the Gods themselves have little to say, barely a paragraph in some cases, Hephaestus and Aphrodite being the most notable in that regard. Some gods have  more substantial amounts of dialog, mainly Zeus and Hera, but the rest talk before boss fights, and that is about it. I remember distinctly (spoilers to those who care) breaking Helios out of Prison, and expecting to see him again after I had done as he asked, but I never saw him again. He just ran off after giving me the requisite three things to blow up. The actual game portion of this game fairs slightly better, though it is also flawed in it's own respects. It is a two-dimensional brawler, with a focus on inventory and clever usage of the tools at your immediate disposal rather than special attacks. Your attack options include tossing various bombs, javelins, darts, or any weapon you happen to be holding at the time, (Hey you! Lets play catch the pike! You first!) blocking or bashing with a shield, over hand and underhand attacks, a faster but weaker stab, healing items for when you are terrible at dodging, at a roll command. Occasionally you can blow something up in the background, usually lanterns and sometimes specific urns, but for the most part that's it. This is improved somewhat with the generally very competent AI, which will attempt to use their superior numbers against you, flanking, dodging attacks, or constantly backing up so they can continue tossing infinite numbers of spears. And finally you have boss fights, when all have their own little quirks to keep them interesting; Apollo shuts off the lights, forcing you to sacrifice your shield for a torch, or else blindly fumble in the dark, Artemis takes turns hunting and being hunted by you, Poseidon attacks your ship at sea, knocking it around trying to knock you overboard, and various monster bosses have their own weaknesses and tactics. This is all well and good, but the combat fumbles a bit with the the combination of an absurd number of weapons at your disposal, and a cumbersome method of switching weapons on the fly, which leaves you vulnerable as you frantically scroll through your six different clubs to reach the hammer you want to use. The Dodge button is also rather finicky, with enemies often hitting you regardless of your efforts to dodge attacks. At the end of the day though, this is a beautiful game, with a wonderful world, with mostly entertaining combat and a mildly lackluster story. In short, I would give this game a 8/10, and a hearty recommendation.			"

Story is not complex but nevertheless the game turns quite interesting.I found myself becoming really enjoying the quests and looking forward to the interactions with the gods through the game.Difficulty is quite ok, neither too difficult or too easy. I recommend to play on the higher difficulty (champion).Game and battle mechanics are far from perfect but when you get hold of it and hit/defense timings it becomes quite entertaining.This is one of those games where you can see the developers put effort and good energy producing it. Recommended!.In a 0 to 10 scale I would give it 7.5/10.			"

												Although I have only played this game for 0.6 hours ( which is soon to change ), I reconmmend this game even though I have not experienced the key aspects and core gameplay yet. Looking at the interface and graphics they both are aesthetically pleasing also might I add dynamic. The story seems very historically accurate due to all of the Greek Gods that appear in Apotheon. This game has all pros and only one con ( for me )which is that this game requires a enhanced skill tree based system ( do not quote on this as I have only played it for a small amount of time ).Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 as the skill tree is fundamentally required for a RPG type game.OrA 9/10 if I am wrong about the skill tree.

												Best Greek Mythology game ever made.Visuals, art style, characters, level design, weapon variety, soundtrack... they are all great.Completion time is okay-ish for the price. I'm definitely up for more levels!Consumables and crafting system is just generic and feels boring. Apotheon needs some creativity there.And the combat system... Yes, I agree it's not optimal in all situations. But it shouldn't be a deal-breaker. Once you get used to it, it's completely acceptable.			"

												The voice acting is amazing in this game. I really, truly enjoyed it. I could really feel the emotion of the characters coming through which is surprising for a 2D game. The combat / boss fights were unique enough to be challenging but not so difficult to cause frustration and repeat deaths. 9/10 Would recommend.			"

												As a whole, the ""Greek Gods"" and ""God vs. Man"" genre of video games is overdone. But this game stands alone. In a new class of 2D combat, Apotheon is a masterpeice. With a unique art style based upon Ancient Greek pottery, this game appears to have a clunky combat system, unworthy of a multiplayer. In actuality, it has a smooth movement system and precise controls that only adds to the playability and competitive nature. All in all. I was impressed. 9.5/10			"

												Funnily enough, a few weeks before learning about Apotheon for the first time, I had a similar idea for a Metroidvania-style game stylized to look like ancient artwork, only Egyptian-style instead of Greek. Not terribly relevant, just noting what got me enthused to play Apotheon in the first place.The basic premise of Apotheon is that Zeus has grown tired of mankind's continuous degeneration, and has decided to call do-over and wipe the Earth clean of mortalkind, and decrees that the gods of Olympus will withdraw their favor. Crops won' grow, sun won't shine, the forests are empty of game, etc. After fending off some desperate raiders in the opening tutorial, Hera bids you to travel to Olympus and take back what the gods have deprived your people of by force. One thing leads to another and you find yourself going head to head with Zeus himself in the climactic battle.Apotheon's being drawing point is definitely its artstyle. The entire game is made to look like Greek pottery art come to life, and it gives the game an identity all is own that serves the tone of the game perfectly. Gameplay wise there isn't much to talk about, pretty typical Metroidvania fare, and in the end I only have three major complaints:1. Weapon degradation has never improved a game. I imagine it was mostly added to force players to try out the different weapons in the game (there's a lot of them), but all it did was make me focus on using the worst weapons in my arsenal just so they'd break and get off the list. Breakable shields is more understandable, but generally speaking iron is slightly more sturdy than carboard and tinfoil.2. The game tends to take more than it gives, which made me resort to farming on more than a few occasions. Farming is for survival games and MMOs. Otherwise it just indicates poor resource distribution.3. The Caduceus of Hermes, while a fun exploration tool, also reveals a number of clumsy level borders, as the developers never intended those areas to be accessed. Many of these are one-way trips and can lead to falling out of the map entirely. I get the feeling the Caduceus was added to the game partway through development and the rest of the game wasn't built with it in mind.All in all these are only mild niggles in what is otherwise a beautiful and engaging Metroidvania title. Definitely give it a go.			"

												I was charmed to try the game by its unique art style that resembles Ancient Greek vase decorations, and I was glad to have tried the game. It's not just an artsy indie game, and the more you play, the better it gets.The game takes place almost entirely on Mt Olympus, and has you visit different areas. There are 2 main hub locations (Agora and Acropolis), and each one contains doorways to a number of other areas. Some of these areas belong to a specific deity, whilst others are just bonus locations. Most of the game's story involves you simply undertaking tasks for each Olympian deity and eventually confronting them one way or another.This is not just a simple 2D platformer. The game has quite an open world and really knows how to reward exploration. There are tonnes of optional areas and hidden secrets, and a huge variety of weapons to collect, many of which are uniques. There's always some delicious surprise around a corner or behind a breakable wall. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the Metroid style games, so if you've ever enjoyed those, you should have a fun time with Apotheon as well.Despite the enormous amount of fun I've had, I've also come across a lot of frustration, which was somewhat disappointing. As some people already pointed out, the combat, although fun and enjoyable, can be a bit tricky and awkward at times, because you have to time your swings really well. Not much of a problem most of the time, but it can be a nightmare when fighting fast moving enemies that either jump at you or fly around.There were some parts of the game where frustration came mostly from controls, such as trying to quickly outclimb the fast-rising flames of river Phlegethon, but most times it was in the boss fights. Although some bosses were a fun challenge, a fair few were frustrating beyond belief and involved mechanics which did not make much sense, like Diomedes being completely invulnerable unless you've thrown a jar of blood at him to stun him, or Zeus somehow being weak to his own lightning bolts, but managing to shrug off blades, clubs, and fire like they were nothing.Still, despite the frustrating sections, I've had a very fun playthrough. The music is also really fantastic and fits the areas perfectly. The most noteworthy one being the eerie track that plays in Hades. So for the most part, this is a really memorable and unique game. I would highly recommend you check it out if you've ever at least remotely enjoyed 2D platformers and sidescrollers.			"

												Possibly the most uniquely stylish Metroidvania ever. And even once you get used to that (it's visually brilliant all the way through, just look at those images up at the top of the page there), it's a very solid game - some fairly complex combat with an impressive variety of weapons and potions, all while working your way through the diverse lairs of the gods, with plenty of secrets to uncover.The story makes excellent use of its mythological roots, and many areas even include markers with relevant excerpts. It's really an impressive game all around - the only things I can even think to point out that weren't excellent were that it can be slightly awkward to switch what you have equipped midcombat (switching from melee to ranged to potions is fine, but switching from one ranged to another requires actually opening your inventory, which is slightly inconvenient with a WASD/mouse control setup) and that I managed to glitch outside of a certain giant spinning level by saving in a weird spot (the autosave was kind enough to rescue me).In short, if you've ever read Greek mythology and thought ""those gods are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, someone needs to take them down a peg"", or if you just want a nice Metroidvania with some seriously snazzy aesthetics, get Apotheon and you'll have a godly time.

												Visuals in this game are stunning, if you did not notice. And overall commitment to ancient greek theme is very commendable. The music is plesant, although one would say lo-fi. And the gameplay is typical for the ""metroidvania"" genre, with the accent on exploration, with relative freedom given to you. The game has a nice set of optional and sometimes hidden quests, finishing such usually grants you some benefits in the main one. Some little things are worth pointing out too. When you run for a while in one direction on a level ground, you start to sprint. This spices the usual tedious walks of the games in this genre. The controls and combat in particular can be very wonky and even random at times. And game overall could really benefit from more polish. There are a lot of bugs and glitches. As if there was little time put in testing. If you want to try this game and did not like the introductory level, i say try one more to get a better feel. The first linear level with such a strange and clunky controls can misderect you from the joy of this game. It's not perfect, but it us surely very fun to play. Boners.			"

												first off, ragdoll physics 1000/10Pros-The campaign is long-Full of ancient greek mythology that makes the story somewhat interesting-Artwork is amazing, captures the game well-Music fits the time period and theme-Many side quests/objectives that can keep you busy even longer if you want-Fighting is pretty simple, but fun-Mechanics of weapons force you to diversify your fighting methods-Maps are big-Each god is somewhat different from each other, and has its own weakness and strength -Large array of weapons-Epic-Price is worth the gameCons-The fighting can get kind button mashy, especially when you have multiple enemies on you at once-Fighting can get repetitive-I feel like i advanced too fast for the gameplay, only 3 hours in I pretty much had the best armor in the game, and just tanked through the rest of the game-the rewards from defeating bosses felt too weak, and pretty much useless in the overall scheme of thingsConclusion-The pros of the game outweigh the cons by a landslide, and i definitely recommend you buying it			"

												What brought me to the game were it's unique visuals, what made me stay was the gameplay.I really missed good platformer games and it's one of the first ones I decided to buy on Steam and I definitely wasn't disapointed. It's a pretty standard platformer with polished gameplay and quite fun combat that's skill-dependent and not based on mashing buttons without coherence. The story is nothing special but it's not bad either. Overall a decent game that brought me quite a few hours of fun.			"

												Apotheon is an action platformer with rpg elements that you will find much more complex and demanding that it may first appear. However, as you pass the first stage of the game, which is learning the mechanics and geting used to the controls, the game becomes surprisingly interesting and rewarding. The story takes place in ancient Greece where the mortal world is abandoned by the gods of Olympus. The gods no longer have a use for humans and since they are also merciless and cruel, they are punishing them. You are a warrior named Nikandreos who seeks to prevend the destruction of your home and people. You meet various gods that help you or try to hurt you and other lessergods or heroes of the rich greek mythology. If you have studied greek mythology then many of the substories will be familiar to you.The presentation is a strong point of this game. A unique art style which is based on the ancient greek mythology and the result is very pleasant to the eye. The music and sound of the game is very good as well. No memorable tracks in general but it all comes together nicely, visuals and sound, it doesn't tire you at all.Gameplay wise Apotheon is an action scroller but it has some rpg elements like weapon and armor management, skill enhancement, a market etc.. but the fighting and the rpg stuff is very well balanced. Playing the game on higher difficulty is in my opinion demanded in order to appreciate the rpg side of the game, otherwise it feels just like an brainless action slasher. As for the negatives, the difference between normal level of difficulty and the higher ones can be frustrating and the controls can be very punishing. The battle sometimes gets glitchy and some key parts of the game can be abused and get passed taking advantage of the controls. Also in some parts of the game I spend a lot of time backtracking which is very annoying in these types of games since you are expecting to play a straightforward action game. All in all, despite being frustrating at some parts, Apotheon was a pleasant surprise. A cool theme- greek mythology, a slick presentation, nice sound, a balanced set of gameplay mechanics, moderate puzzle solving and a nice level design. I got to say that 2-3 levels as you get to the end of the game have very cool ideas and are really unique. The Athena one, the Poseidon, and a couple of others were great. Definitely looking forward to Apotheon 2.			"

												If you want a short review:Graphics: Georgeous, very successfuly represent the stories etched on ancient Greek vases, as far as the artistic side is concernedSoundtrack: Gets you in the mood right of the bat. Extremely well composed and suited to the atmosphere of the game. Just like in Hotline Miami, the music makes of a very important factor in this game.Story: The story itself isn't really jawdropping, but features very well designed gods, both in terms of their appearance and character.Combat: The controls might be a bit unintuitive at the beginning, but you will get used to them quite quickly. Although relatively simple, the combat really has a high skill cap, especially on higher difficulty levels.Difficulty: Very difficult, especially on Champion and Olympian levels. The difference between Warrior and Champion is pretty huge, but unfortunately enough for the fans of extreme challenge, the only difference between Champion and Olympian is the lack of health regeneration. Still, the bosses can be really painful and will often require preemptive strategy and tactics to beat them.Overall: 9/10.Although I wouldn't place this game in the pantheon (hue) of the greatest indie games of all time (ex. FTL, Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain, Shovel Knight), it is still a must buy for any person who likes platforming, the interesting graphics and difficult combat.PS.Use hatchets for maximum manliness.

												I don't know how to describe how amazing my Apotheon experience was without sounding like a total nutcase. This. Game. Is. ♥♥♥♥ing. Amazing! Absolutely the best action-adventure-platformer I've played this year! I give it a huge 10/10!The setting is so beautifully expressed through the fantastic graphics Apotheon has to offer. Everything blends together well while keeping the foreground action obvious. Never do you get confused or lose your character. The art direction is exceptional.The controls are soooooooo tight—they would have to be to make the crux of the gameplay so manageable and easygoing. Well, I say ""easygoing,"" but in reality, the game's hard as balls if you let it take you over. You're rewarded for going out of your way to explore little nooks, finding more and new weapons and armors to better define your playstyle. You may not like swords for their short range, so you decide to use spears, although you might not like spears for their stabbing attack animations, so you start using maces for their arch and shield-breaking capabilities.... You decide how you want to play Apotheon... It gives you the freedom to go wild. I believe that might be where people make the comparison with Dark Souls: How you can be plotted right into a battlefield with no hand-holding, having to learn on your own. It's quite a marvelous experience.The soundtrack, produced by Marios Aristopoulos, is phenominal. From the moment you begin your epic, to your final battle, Marios compliments the beautiful scenery with a range of ambient to intense music (all strings, by the way) to create the perfect atmosphere!Enemies are difficult as ajghksjbnfk.jasdbnlf. They're soooo difficult later on, they're sooo annoying, but they're sooooo satisfying to overcome, considering there is no one way to beat them. Learning patterns isn't about determining how the developers intended for the enemy to be killed, it's about figuring out when it would be optimal for you to get a hit off before he manages to stagger you. I say this, however I can't attest to how the Normal gamemode plays. Having done my first playthrough on Champion (the hardest of the two difficulties), I definitely felt as though that was the way the game was intended to be played. I haven't played the Normal mode, but the descriptions for the two are really quite accurate. Hell, there's a potion in the game that removes the enemies' ability to stagger you temporarily, while getting staggered is only possible in Champion difficulty. Aaaaaaaaall this to say: Play the game on Champion. You'll have an intense time.I don't know how to close this off. This game was so phenominal! Everything was done deliberately; You can feel the quality! There are absolutely no inconsistencies that I had an immediate reaction to or anything. No graphical issues, no audio issues, no gameplay issues.... nothing felt unfair. It was just a solid, absolutely QUALITY game... and I give it a big ol', delicious, whole-hearted 10 out of 10. "

												9/10Basically, you kill stuff to get their loot, then you upgrade and kill more stuff, but this time, with better weapons! :DThe physics of the game is pretty good, and I haven't encountered any bugs, so that's sorted. The whole game is steeped in Greek myth, as you would know if you watched the trailer, and I can see the amount of effort the devs put into this game. Art work is beautiful and I was never once bored with this game.As for replayability, I'd say it's okay. I would play it again in a bit because it's just that good, albeit in a harder mode. Multiplayer has been set up too so you can now spear your friends to death. My only regret is getting this game on sale. Yes, it's that worth it.(It's not a 10/10 yet because they need a Multiplayer campaign.)			"

												A visually captivating 2D platform game with great theming and simple mechanics in which a smart artistic concept creates a very aesthetic environment for a nice platform experience.The combat system is pretty straight forward, with a simple dodge ability to avoid attacks and a stamina bar limiting your moves. The angle and momentum of your attacks are important if you want to take down your enemies efficiently. The game also offers a plethora of melee and ranged weapons to use according to occation or to your liking.Story wise  its the same old scenario where a man goes against the gods of Olympus, nothing we haven't already seen in other games, namely God of War, or in movies. Level design is generally good and unique which helps to retain players' interest. On the other hand the total game length is rather short.In addition, as in every platform game, there is some puzzle solving, alas not complex enough (or at all) in many cases.As for the art style, a simple glimpse says it all. The use of ancient greek vase artwork for a 2D platform game is not only convinient for this genre but it bonds extremely well with both the theme, story and gameplay. Overall its a very good 2D platformer and certainly its worth its price value, though it needs a little bit more features and content.			"

												This game is really good but I dont wanna do a review. So heres how to make Enchiladas:1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2 In a large frying pan at medium-high heat add a tablespoon of oil. When the oil is shimmering and hot (not quite smoking), add a corn tortilla to the pan. Cook it for 2-3 seconds, use a metal spatula to turn it over, and cook it for 2 to 3 seconds more. Lift up the tortilla with a spatula, add another tortilla underneath. Cook the second tortilla for 2-3 seconds, lift both tortillas, and add another tortilla underneath. Repeat the process with all the tortillas, adding more oil as needed. This way you can brown and soften the tortillas without using a lot of fat. It's important to pre-cook the tortillas because not only does cooking them help soften them for rolling, cooking them in a little fat helps develop the flavor of the tortillas. As the tortillas brown a little, remove them to a plate.3 Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-6 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more. Add the crushed tomatoes. Add the green chiles. Add 1/2 cup of water. Add the oregano. Bring to a simmer and taste. If the sauce tastes too vinegary, add half a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce. Remove from heat.3 Put a little olive oil on the bottom of a 3-quart casserole pan. Take a tortilla, cover 2/3 of it lightly with the shredded cheese, then roll up the tortilla and place it in the casserole pan. Continue until all tortillas are filled and rolled.4 Add sauce to the top of the tortillas in the the casserole pan. Make sure the rolled up tortillas are covered with the sauce. If not, add a little water to thin the sauce to spread it more evenly over the tortillas. Cover the whole thing with the rest of the grated cheese. Put the casserole in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese melts.Serve with sliced iceberg lettuce that has been dressed only with vinegar and salt. Garnish enchiladas with cilantro and sour cream.Here is the full wiki for Enchiladas:Enchiladas originated in Mexico, where the practice of rolling tortillas around other food dates back at least to Maya times. The people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by Hernán Cortés in Coyoacán, which included foods served in corn tortillas. (Note that the native Nahuatl name for the flat corn bread used was tlaxcalli; the Spanish give it the name tortilla.) The Nahuatl word for enchilada is chīllapītzalli  which is formed of the Nahuatl word for ""chili"", and the Nahuatl word for ""flute"". In the 19th century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, El cocinero mexicano (""The Mexican Chef""), published in 1831, and in Mariano Galvan Rivera's Diccionario de Cocina, published in 1845. An early mention, in English, is a 1914 recipe found in California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook, by Bertha Haffner Ginger.Varieties - In their original form as Mexican street food, enchiladas were simply corn tortillas dipped in chili sauce and eaten without fillings. There are now many varieties, which are distinguished primarily by their sauces, fillings and, in one instance, by their form. Various adjectives may be used to describe the recipe content or origin, e.g. enchilada tapatia would be a recipe from Jalisco.Varieties include:Enchiladas con chile rojo (with red chile) is a traditional red enchilada sauce, composed of dried red chili peppers soaked and ground into a sauce with other seasonings, Chile Colorado sauce adds a tomato base.Enchiladas con mole, instead of chili sauce, are served with mole, and are also known as enmoladas.Enchiladas placera are Michoacán plaza-style, made with vegetables and poultry.Enchiladas poblanas are soft corn tortillas filled with chicken and poblano peppers, topped with oaxaca cheese.Enchiladas potosinas originate from San Luis Potosi, Mexico and are made with cheese-filled, chili-spiced masa.Enchiladas San Miguel are San Miguel de Allende-style enchiladas flavored with guajillo chilies by searing the flavor into the tortillas in a frying pan.A plate of enchiladas suizas.Enchiladas suizas (Swiss-style) are topped with a white, milk or cream-based sauce, such as béchamel. This appellation is derived from Swiss immigrants to Mexico who established dairies to produce cream and cheese.Enfrijoladas are topped with refried beans rather than chili sauce; their name come from frijol, meaning ""bean"".Entomatadas are made with tomato sauce instead of chile sauce.Enchiladas montadas, stacked enchiladas, are a New Mexico variation in which corn tortillas are fried flat until softened but not tough, then stacked with red or green sauce, chopped onion and shredded cheese between the layers and on top of the stack. Ground beef or chicken can be added to the filling, but meat is not traditional. The stack is often topped (montada) with a fried egg. Shredded lettuce and sliced black olives may be added as a garnish.ur welcum now bye			"

												Great game! Recommended for fans of Metroidvania, close quarters combat and/or Greek Mithology. The Graphic style is pretty original, and the music and sound effects are spot-on for the art style. Level design is pretty good and it doesn't make itself repetitive. Higly recomended.			"

												Apotheon is a fun, 2-D action game, with a few bugbears in the works, but nothing that stops it from being a wonderful experience.The game is (if you couldn't tell) based on greek myth. The short version of the plot is that zeus is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at mortals and wants to wipe the planet of them, hera (his wife and sister, yes, greek myth is ♥♥♥♥ed up like that) doesn't like the♥♥♥♥♥♥he is pulling and decides to make you her champion. From there you go around God of War style and murder most of the greek gods, some of them help you, but most want your head on a pike.The gameplay is rather simple, yet effective and varied enough to keep it from getting boring. You have two sections of weapons, melee and ranged, during the course of the game you'll pick up many different weapons and can scroll through them all with a flick of the mouse wheel mid combat to get just the right tool for the job. Anything from knives to hammers that cause the ground to explode are on offer, hell, even some arrows that turn enemies into allies later on to. You also get a shield with which to stop the enemies from turning you into crumbled red feta cheese. Everything has durability and will eventually break, meaning you constantly need to swap out weapons and your shield (which you can only carry one of) in order to survive in combat, this forces you to change your play style on the fly, which can be a bit difficult, but once you get it down your fine. Normally you can pick up weapons from more or less everywhere, same with shields, but they are just sparse enough to make you keep swapping them out.Actual fighting is a little messy, since its all on a 2-D plane and normally its you VS three or four dudes at a time, all of which can attack as quickly as you. When you use the shield you create a barrier in the direction your arrow is facing, and anything that hits it is blocked, but this costs durability. Some shields offer bigger barriers than others, meaning it is possible to crack someone over the head with a hammer even if they are defending. The AI in this game is pretty good, as they will block if they have the time and will dodge attacks unless your quick and aim well. Its not so hard that its impossible, just that it requires good amount of concentration.Visually, the game is very unique, its designed to look like the side of those greek vases, and it is pulled off really nicely. The soundtrack is also a rather lovely bit of work, you don't notice it much, but when you do its nicely themed and well composed.The game also drops alot of greek mythology lore on you from start to finish, both in the form of actual levels and tablets that are scattered about. Its interesting to see how they use some of the tales, oh, and before you ask, yes, you do fight a chimera.Its not the kind of game you'd use to teach people about greek mythology, but it is a game that you can play if your looking for a 2-D, budget God of War, or if your looking for a truly unique and overall satisfying experience in the form of a greek Metroidvania game.

SummaryApotheon is a side-scrolling action platformer with a unique and interesting art style. It's a solid ~10 hour game that gets a bit repetitive towards the end.In detailThe art style is what got me curious about the game and eventually to try it out. The story is pretty much what you'd expect from a tale involving an ancient Greek mythology setting: Nothing special, but keeps you working towards a clear goal and has a satisfying conclusion. The progression is fairly linear, though in some sections you can choose the order you want to complete the objectives and there are some optional ones as well.The gameplay consists mainly of you fighting your way towards the current objective using a variety of different melee and ranged weapons. Combat takes a while to get used to as you're generally better off dodging or blocking first and delay attacking until there's an opportunity to do so. Some twists are thrown into the combat formula mix later, like the possibility of placing or using environmental traps or flinging large boulders at enemies. Movement and combat controls feel fluent for a controller, but I can't say how it would play out using a mouse and keyboard.Some sections contain minor puzzle elements and require something a bit different than just travelling from point A to B. I wouldn't exactly call this a ""metroidvania"" -game though despite being tagged as such. To me that term implies that there is and exploration element and backtracking involved i.e. that there are (optional) power ups that allow you to access parts of the game that you can't when you first encounter them. Now there are some secret areas and things to discover here and there, but they're not gated behind the powers you unlock while progressing through the main story.I had to give up on my completionist habit quickly as there's just an overabundance of breakable things and chests to loot and they rarely contain anything useful. That leads to the biggest issue I had with the game: The loot, crafting and the light RPG elements felt a bit tacked on. You can purchase better armor and attack training for various weapon types, but I didn't notice the effects of the upgrades in my ability to survive in combat. The crafting options are quite limited and I was mostly crafting health potions and bombs to blow up cracked walls.All the weapons and shields, even the special ones, also have a duration and they wear down when used in combat. That made the special weapons feel more like consumable resources rather than actual difference making equipment upgrades and I think that also took away some of the strategy in combats. There are some weapon specific combat mechanics, such as you can destroy enemy shields with hammer weapons, have longer range with spears etc. but I just didn't bother since everything just breaks eventually. I frequently found myself just using whatever I had in my hand at the time until it broke down and a new weapon popped up from the inventory. As final, shorter side notes: Music and sound effects did their job, but nothing apart from the (occasionally over-)dramatic voice acting stood out for me. The game also crashed on me once and unfortunately it happened when I tried to save, so the save file got corrupted. Luckily the game auto saves so I could pick up from the latest of those without losing too much progress.RecommendationI was expecting an exploration-focused, Zelda II-esque game where you wander around, talk to people in towns, accept side quests, buy stuff etc. but unfortunately it didn't turn out to be exactly like that. Although I was slightly disappointed with some aspects of the game and the gameplay not having much variety, it might be worth checking out even if just for the neat visual style.			"

												Side scrolling metroidvania type game. Wonderful graphics and music. Fun physics based combat. LOTS of weapons to use. Potion and item crafting. Kind of an RPG but there's no character leveling. Honestly, this game has a lot more content and variety of weapons than I was originally expecting. This game has exceeded my expectations and for the price, it's a winner.			"

												This game gets an A+ on Presentation!  It's beautiful and stylish in a remarkable way.  That's what kept me going for a while...  but I just couldn't learn to love the combat controls.  There are lots of different weapons, each with their own unique timing and effective range.  But mastering combat with moving targets and multiple enemies is ridiculous, and in spite of my best efforts, I always had to resort to button mashing.  It's not fun.  Button mashing works because there are lots of health potions, and your health regenerates after fights anyway, so you can just tank damage.  I never felt like I actually succeeded because of my skill.			"

												I typically don't review games, but despite the cool deign, look, and mood of the game the controls make extremely diffcult. Not in the challenging way either. More in the, ""If the controls didn't suck I may be having fun"" kind of way. If you like trying to jump somehwere over and over again or randomly button masshing trying to hit your target, then this game is for you. Seriously, I was excited for this and kept on playing, but it just made me miserable everytime I tried to jump somewhere or hit something.			"

												If you enjoyed NES ""Battle of Olympus"", ""Legend of Zelda: The adventures of Link"" or ""Metroid"", you will enjoy the hell out of Apotheon. This gives you that old school platform feel with a fresh style and fun mechanics.It will be worth your dollars to give it a try and Apotheon will repay you with hours of enjoyment.A few things i recommend you do.-Turn on the subtitles, I feel it adds to the games design and flows well with the voice acting.-The control combat is not your typical “Stick-Jock” style, there is a depth of strategy to the to the attacks that may take some getting used to. I personally had no issues with the controls on a game pad and it lead to some interest attack and shield defense moves.As far as the game goes. -Great Greek filled mythological story. -Great soundtrack (DLC, well worth adding on).-Full Voice acting is superb.-Beautiful level areas along with secret locations held within.-Fun and interesting combat system with both mythological weapons.-The ability to improve your hero’s Armor and Weapon proficiencies.-Simple and nice inventory/crafting system. -Adjustable Level Difficulty settings.-Complete gamepad mapping.-Multi-player Local (Have not attempted this yet).-Co-Op (coming soon).It will nice to see if there will be any add-ons in the future to continue the story of Apotheon.Having been playing games in all genera’s since my first commodore 16, there have been moments over the past few years that I was looking for something enjoyable and not bloated with all that “Look at all the things our game offers” and then to find out most of those things are broken or just weigh the overall experience down. Apotheon is a beautiful game that offers just the right amount of everything to make entertaining and continues bringing back for longer play sessions. It has been a long time since I played a game with such enjoyment or even looked forward to playing as much as I do with Apotheon.The only thing I would like to see in the future is an equipable inventory system for a DLC continuation of Apotheon story.Thank you Apotheon Team.

 A short, gorgeous and wonderfully enjoyable action-adventure romp Apotheon is a damn fun action game and a damn fun exploration game all mixed up with an extremely accurate depiction of Greek Mythology and one of the most damn gorgeous art styles you'll likely ever see in a video game, though it is not without it's short-comings in a few areas. Gameplay The gameplay of Apotheon is primarily split between two elements: Combat and Exploration. The areas of Mount Olympus are fairly large and have a lot to see and do in them, as well as a lot to murder in them. First off, the combat. The player wields a variety of ancient weaponry that you can stab, slash and throw; as well as wielding a few other fun toys such as ancient Greek molotovs and grenades for some reason (it's not as out of place as it might sound). Combat is a simple matter of rolling, attacking and blocking, but it's simplicity is it's strength. I will never forget the moment I set a man on fire and then harpooned him into orbit with one of my spears as he fell of a ledge. The combat is very much a sandbox and can be approached in whatever way the player chooses and as such is extremely enjoyable at times, though not without it's frustrations. The smaller more common enemies tend to dodge a lot making landing melee hits quite frustrating at times though it's not a huge problem. The other half of the gameplay is exploration, running around the various hubs collecting things, looting, questing, etcetera. This is great fun for the most part and everywhere has somethign to find, though it has more frustrations than the combat portion of the game. The games ""quests"" aren't tracked and you aren't given any indication of where you need to be for anything other than the main story, which means finding things can be a pain and is heavily reliant on your memory of the levels, though clearing out the various hubs is an extremely rewarding experience. Boss fights are the biggest Strength and weakness of Apotheon. Certain fights, such as the fights against Zeus and Poseidon are incredibly enjoyable and present something new to the player, though other fights, namely Ares, can play out just like any other combat encounter in the game and let the player down after the huge build up to them; though I must say the variety in the level designs for each God's domain is amazing, and the objectives required to reach them never leave the player bored, e.g. Kill a variety of Greek mythological figures, storm a castle with a group of undead minions, traverse the seas to defeat Poseidon. All in all, Apotheon is just a brilliantly enjoyable game. Story Apotheon's story is nothing special, but the way it's presented is sure to please those with an interest in Greek mythology. You play as Nikandreos, champion to Hera, ascending the slopes of Mount Olympus to challenge the gods that have abandoned your people, taking their power via either their allegiance or their death. Ultimately, it's a fairly generic story, though the presentation of the various mythological figures is spot-on throughout making it fairly compelling if you are interested in that sort of thing. There's nothing inherently bad about the story, and it's certainly accurate, but it wasn't anything special. Sound Design The sound design is good overall. Nothing great, nothing bad. Weapons sound as you'd expect and are fairly enjoyable to use as such. Every single sound the player makes is fine, although environmental sounds are lacking. Enemies and NPCs seem to make almost no sound whatsoever outside of speech and combat, which whilst not entirely bad is a little strange. The voice-acting is passable. Whilst it's not awful, it's also not that great. The dialogue did not engage me at any point (not due to the writing, that's fine, it's due to the voiceover) but it also never bored me to sleep. Rising above the complete averageness of the sounds and voices though is the music, which whilst not always noticeable is fantastic and definitely adds to the mood of the game, especially during some of the more climactic moments such as the climb to fight Zeus. Conclusion In Conclusion, whilst being flawed in many ways and having it's fair share of frustrations, Apotheon offers what I consider to be an extremely compelling and entertaining semi-metroidvania experience that constantly presents the player with something new and interesting to do. If you can ignore the relatively minor flaws that this game has there is an absolutely superb experience to be had.			"

												Nice artwork but don't trust the promises of the developers. Is this a good game? Yes. Until you hit a critical bug and you cannot continue.Happened to me and several other people.The game is nice, but the the people behind this are not trustworthy, so i will never buy a game from them again. Not only because of a critical and acknowledged bug that they plainly ignore for YEARS. (see herehttp://steamcommunity.com/app/208750/discussions/1/523890681419953528/  ). NO response from the developers. which is a common pattern with the Alientrap studio:this studio lies to their customers. they were in development but already accepted your money. they promised a SINGLE PLAYER PC game. they had a published release date. then that date went past and NO response, NO sign, NO post. then after a FEW MONTHS they publish that apotheon will be coming to consoles and that they are working on that. all the guys that had already supported them and had waited for their finished PC game? well, too bad for them! they also announced that they are working on multiplayer at some point. was that what the people who initially supported them had wanted? no. they actually wanted a single player pc game. well too bad for them. finally the game got released. i play it, i guess like many others too.then suddenly i cannot continue because i run into a bug, apparently like many others too.(see => http://steamcommunity.com/app/208750/discussions/1/523890681419953528/ )well, too bad for us!i am through with you Alientrap. The game is great. As long as it works. Never again. I can apologize bugs. I even could apologize if I get a ""WontFix"" answer. But getting nothing at all for such a long time is not an acceptable nor a professional way to deal with your customers.therefore, consider well before buying "

												Solid 2D platformer with a Greek theme.  The art style is top notch, but at times the combat hit detection can get wonky because of the various weapon lengths.  The game is also meant to be played with a gamepad, and if you're using an Xbox 360 controller its heavy reliance on the D-Pad can get frustrating due to its inaccuracy.  Those few issues aside, I'd still recommend it.			"

												There's not much that is more pleasing than to throw a huge javelin from 40ft cutting clean through the throat of your enemy (gandalfvoice), justiceboner, am I right?But for reals, Apotheon is an immensely atmospheric greek mythology platformer, impressively developed by Alientrap.Not only does the gameplay feel pleasing and rewarding throughout the whole runthrough, but there's A LOT (I tell you, A LOT) of research done on greek mythology, it's a good arena for learning and easy for nerds to appreciate.Two criterias of which you need to scratch of one to make this an obligatory purchase:1 - Greek Mythology Enthusiast - I mean come on, you can't resist this.2 - Action role-playing platformer fan - very well executed, how you want them all to feel.Also: credz to the composer Marios Aristopolous for tremendously fitting theme-music in extraordinary detail - he really hit the target on this one.

												I'll list out the positives and negatives:+ Spectacular presentation, both in video and audio department. This is one damn pretty game.+ It's highly literate in Greek mythology. This isn't some cheap cash-in with a skin deep mythology paint on it.+ The length is just right. I finished it at around 10 hours.+  There are tons of weapons you can choose from and master, each with a different use, speed and reach.+ The controversial battle system is actually pretty awesome once you stick with it and master it. I'd recommend using a controller and having both thumbs on the analog sticks for most of the game.- The controls are too convoluted.

I had to quit the game and restart from my saves.All in all, this is a high quality game and a very intricately designed piece of art and experience in itself. You can definitely come out of this game with loads of more general information on Greek mythology. That ending definitely made me think and that's something I can't say about most games. Despite the VERY minor glitches, If you can stick with the fighting mechanics and like action/adventure/RPG style gameplay with amazing presentation and art direction, you definitely can't go wrong with Apotheon.Thumbs way up!

												There's not much that is more pleasing than to throw a huge javelin from 40ft cutting clean through the throat of your enemy (gandalfvoice), justiceboner, am I right?But for reals, Apotheon is an immensely atmospheric greek mythology platformer, impressively developed by Alientrap.Not only does the gameplay feel pleasing and rewarding throughout the whole runthrough, but there's A LOT (I tell you, A LOT) of research done on greek mythology, it's a good arena for learning and easy for nerds to appreciate.Two criterias of which you need to scratch of one to make this an obligatory purchase:1 - Greek Mythology Enthusiast - I mean come on, you can't resist this.2 - Action role-playing platformer fan - very well executed, how you want them all to feel.Also: credz to the composer Marios Aristopolous for tremendously fitting theme-music in extraordinary detail - he really hit the target on this one. (Not that many video game themes I can listen to when not actually playing them). 5/7			"

												Nice artwork but don't trust the promises of the developers. Is this a good game? Yes. Until you hit a critical bug and you cannot continue.Happened to me and several other people.The game is nice, but the the people behind this are not trustworthy, so i will never buy a game from them again. Not only because of a critical and acknowledged bug that they plainly ignore for YEARS. (see herehttp://steamcommunity.com/app/208750/discussions/1/523890681419953528/  ). NO response from the developers. which is a common pattern with the Alientrap studio:this studio lies to their customers. they were in development but already accepted your money. they promised a SINGLE PLAYER PC game. they had a published release date. then that date went past and NO response, NO sign, NO post. then after a FEW MONTHS they publish that apotheon will be coming to consoles and that they are working on that. all the guys that had already supported them and had waited for their finished PC game? well, too bad for them! they also announced that they are working on multiplayer at some point. was that what the people who initially supported them had wanted? no. they actually wanted a single player pc game. well too bad for them. finally the game got released. i play it, i guess like many others too.then suddenly i cannot continue because i run into a bug, apparently like many others too.(see => http://steamcommunity.com/app/208750/discussions/1/523890681419953528/ )well, too bad for us!i am through with you Alientrap. The game is great. As long as it works. Never again. I can apologize bugs. I even could apologize if I get a ""WontFix"" answer. But getting nothing at all for such a long time is not an acceptable nor a professional way to deal with your customers.therefore, consider well before buying "

												Solid 2D platformer with a Greek theme.  The art style is top notch, but at times the combat hit detection can get wonky because of the various weapon lengths.  The game is also meant to be played with a gamepad, and if you're using an Xbox 360 controller its heavy reliance on the D-Pad can get frustrating due to its inaccuracy.  Those few issues aside, I'd still recommend it.			"

 A short, gorgeous and wonderfully enjoyable action-adventure romp Apotheon is a damn fun action game and a damn fun exploration game all mixed up with an extremely accurate depiction of Greek Mythology and one of the most damn gorgeous art styles you'll likely ever see in a video game, though it is not without it's short-comings in a few areas. Gameplay The gameplay of Apotheon is primarily split between two elements: Combat and Exploration. The areas of Mount Olympus are fairly large and have a lot to see and do in them, as well as a lot to murder in them. First off, the combat. The player wields a variety of ancient weaponry that you can stab, slash and throw; as well as wielding a few other fun toys such as ancient Greek molotovs and grenades for some reason (it's not as out of place as it might sound). Combat is a simple matter of rolling, attacking and blocking, but it's simplicity is it's strength. I will never forget the moment I set a man on fire and then harpooned him into orbit with one of my spears as he fell of a ledge. The combat is very much a sandbox and can be approached in whatever way the player chooses and as such is extremely enjoyable at times, though not without it's frustrations. The smaller more common enemies tend to dodge a lot making landing melee hits quite frustrating at times though it's not a huge problem. The other half of the gameplay is exploration, running around the various hubs collecting things, looting, questing, etcetera. This is great fun for the most part and everywhere has somethign to find, though it has more frustrations than the combat portion of the game. The games ""quests"" aren't tracked and you aren't given any indication of where you need to be for anything other than the main story, which means finding things can be a pain and is heavily reliant on your memory of the levels, though clearing out the various hubs is an extremely rewarding experience. Boss fights are the biggest Strength and weakness of Apotheon. Certain fights, such as the fights against Zeus and Poseidon are incredibly enjoyable and present something new to the player, though other fights, namely Ares, can play out just like any other combat encounter in the game and let the player down after the huge build up to them; though I must say the variety in the level designs for each God's domain is amazing, and the objectives required to reach them never leave the player bored, e.g. Kill a variety of Greek mythological figures, storm a castle with a group of undead minions, traverse the seas to defeat Poseidon. All in all, Apotheon is just a brilliantly enjoyable game. Story Apotheon's story is nothing special, but the way it's presented is sure to please those with an interest in Greek mythology. You play as Nikandreos, champion to Hera, ascending the slopes of Mount Olympus to challenge the gods that have abandoned your people, taking their power via either their allegiance or their death. Ultimately, it's a fairly generic story, though the presentation of the various mythological figures is spot-on throughout making it fairly compelling if you are interested in that sort of thing. There's nothing inherently bad about the story, and it's certainly accurate, but it wasn't anything special. Sound Design The sound design is good overall. Nothing great, nothing bad. Weapons sound as you'd expect and are fairly enjoyable to use as such. Every single sound the player makes is fine, although environmental sounds are lacking. Enemies and NPCs seem to make almost no sound whatsoever outside of speech and combat, which whilst not entirely bad is a little strange. The voice-acting is passable. Whilst it's not awful, it's also not that great. The dialogue did not engage me at any point (not due to the writing, that's fine, it's due to the voiceover) but it also never bored me to sleep. Rising above the complete averageness of the sounds and voices though is the music, which whilst not always noticeable is fantastic and definitely adds to the mood of the game, especially during some of the more climactic moments such as the climb to fight Zeus. Conclusion In Conclusion, whilst being flawed in many ways and having it's fair share of frustrations, Apotheon offers what I consider to be an extremely compelling and entertaining semi-metroidvania experience that constantly presents the player with something new and interesting to do. If you can ignore the relatively minor flaws that this game has there is an absolutely superb experience to be had.			"

rating: worth buying at sale price (<8€)score: 6/10 - solidsimilar games: Disney´s Hercules Action Game, Rogue Legacy, Dark Soulstarget audience: fans of greek mythology, metroidvania (this is not a metroidvania though), explorationApotheon is a beautiful game. There were parts I really liked this game, but there were also parts where the game was ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. It has some really cool ideas, but the devs also made some bad design decisions. Still, its worth a play, especially because of its satisfying ending and even for its full price you cant do much wrong, but I recommend waiting for a sale. GameplayMy biggest problem with Apotheon was that it wasnt a challenging game. The problem is not that the combat is too easy, but there are some features which breaks the challenge. First the fact that you can have healing items in your inventory is a bad design decision in my opinion (for this game) and even worse is that you can craft healing items. Even if you play bad, you can just keep healing and go. Crafting healing items isnt even that hard and also you will find tons of healing items on the way. Until half of the game I always had the maximum amount of healing items in my inventory and later I only had less because I started wasting them since I didnt need to fight efficient anyway. There are some ways you could solve this, I think for this kind of a game a health system like Dark Souls would be best. You get a set amount of potions and can only refill them at checkpoints. This way the devs always know how much potions the player has and can balance that part of the level accordingly.Another thing which breaks the challenge is that dieing in this game is meaningless, you just respawn and can continue. I didnt really understand how it works, cause sometimes everything was the way it was before after respawn, sometimes everything reset, maybe it depends if its a boss fight or not, I dont know.The AI sometimes does really random things or makes an extremely fast move or jump which makes them annoying to fight sometimes. The most annoying enemies were the sentrys, because they attack so fast that you cant block an arrow and make a counter attack after that, you HAVE to take a hit (on higher difficulty at least). There are even more annoying when they are at the ceiling and use blast arrows or hydra fangs.Some enemys have really powerful attacks which is fine, but sometimes those attacks launch you 100km away to weird places, also annoying. The inventory system is a mess. Extremely clonky and hard to manage, annoying. At at last there are some O P consumable potions, especially the potion which makes you invulnerable which COMPLETELY breaks the game, they are not even hard to craft its ridiculous. They should take out EVERY consumable item.So whats good about this game? Combat, even if sometimes annoying, is still fun, especially because of the many many different enemy types which I really appreciate. Later in the game when you have many more tools to fight with, combat gets even more fun and sometimes you can pull of crazy moves which will kill many enemys at once which is very satisfying to do.There are many different weapons, which behave different more or less, there are also some rare weapons with special effects. Same goes for shields and bows. You can summon minions, set traps, use bombs, there is alot you can do and whats more important is that you NEED to use different tactics against different kinds of enemys.The devs had some neat ideas for every level, the game has enough variety so you never get bored, unless the game gets too annoying. The boss fights were really fun and some of them really well made, especially the final boss. However the invulnerability potions breaks every fight (fortunately I figured them out really late so I used them only in 2 fights).Overall the gameplay is fun, motivating, satisfying and rewarding because of a nice progression system. All parts of the game are full of annoyances though, for some people more, for others less, so for you this could be a blast to play, or a very frustrating experience. For me the good parts made up the annoying things so I can recommend this game.NarrativeThe narrative of the game is basicly God of War. You are a human, Zeus is bored so he makes orders to destroy humanity or something like that, you want revenge and save your people so you kill every greek god until Zeus. The nice thing is that you probably know about greek mythology, so when you see your next objective which is for example ""kill Ares"", then you already are excited about it before you even meet him. This works because they gave them interesting personalitys, well at the end most of them are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but still they are fun to listen to. They have good voice actors are their writing is fine. There is no real big narrative though, its just something to give the gameplay some context, but thats fine to me, and at least it keeps you motivated throughout the game.Aesthetics/ GraphicsThe game looks beautiful, there is not much to say about its visuals. It can get a bit dull though, some areas of the game have different color palettes which bring some variety. The problem I have with the aesthetics is that sometimes there was too much on the screen and it was hard to tell where my character was standing or were I was aiming, or I didnt identify something as a trap which explodes when you attack it so I accidently made things explode many times.Oh also there are many naked people, including♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥SoundtrackMusic is good. Has enough variety and fits the game and its mood. Not much to say about it really.			"

												I have to say that there are definitely some pro's to the game, the majority of which are in its overall style. However, the game turned out to be a pretty big letdown overall due to the gameplay, as many other people seem to also complain about - and further, the developer seems like they haven't been that helpful with some big issues.I'll lay it out simply. The artistic style was the entire reason I got hooked into playing the game, right when I saw it. And I happen to love Greek mythology as well - or pretty much anything set in or focused around the mythology. I was super excited to play the game, but right off the bat I had a very big problem.The game simply did not load up for me at all. It showed a black screen, then the application closed. Thankfully, some people in the forum had a fix for installing some framework MSI that came with the game, and it worked for me. However, a good amount of people seemed to claim that didn't work for them and that they were just unable to play the game entirely. I've not really seen the developer respond about this problem, which is extremely important considering it's playing the freaking game! That's a big strike right away.There's a thread about the above problem in the Bug Reports sub-forum right now still.However, I followed along as I was still hooked in, and the above fix worked for me in about 5 minutes. Right away in the game, I noticed how bad the controls were. The setting changes don't matter, and mouse/keyboard vs. controller also doesn't really matter. The game has a weird lag in a lot of the motions, and your character doesn't function properly.You move relatively slowly for a bit, until your character can suddenly start sprinting if you're still moving in the same direction - however, the moment you hit any sort of incline at all, even if it's like a 10 degree ramp, your character comes to a complete stop and then starts moving slowly up the incline again. This happens all over the place, so your motion is really bad much of the time. Bringing that into combat, you have tough enemies moving around you while you keep getting stuck or bouncing around in certain corners or places.Also, while it is realistic that a person can't be sprinting and then immediately turn 180 degrees and keep sprinting, they can definitely keep a lot faster speed than your character. The same thing happens as with the little inclines. If you turn around, your character becomes a snail again for a short bit. Such a thing is really bad in battles when the enemies get around you easily.And speaking of battles - some of the characteristics are fine, along with a general collection of weapons. But again, the gameplay is poor in the sense that very often when you swing melee weapons all over the place, you can be too close to the enemies and the weapons just pass through or over them, which does not make much sense in a 2D game. Even spears did this at times - if I am jutting a spear straight ahead, it shouldn't pass through an enemy. Thus, the stamina mechanic was made more of a pain when half the time you lose stamina without being able to hit anything.Another issue is the UI in certain places - particularly in item descriptions and in the shops. The descriptions for some items, if long, will run off the screen even if you are in the max resolution for your PC. But more importantly, once you unlock enough items, you will be unable to buy some of them in the shops. The shops keep the items in a vertical list, and you'll eventually hit a limit where items will run off of the screen and you can't select them. There's even a thread about this right now (""Cloak and Dagger..."" in the General Discussions).In fact, there's a good amount of Bug Reports threads and the developer seems to not really be around much or care.There's more things I could go on about, including a good amount of lag in places too, but I don't want to sit here going on forever. The controls and gameplay overall are some of the biggest critical problems with Apotheon. I tried to give the game my best try and completed it simply because I wanted to witness all of the style, but it is really a pain in many places due to its problems.I can't willingly tell someone else to buy the game because I am sure there are many people who will hate it due to the above implementation issues.

												I really wanted to give this a positive review, the aesthetics look just great and the minimalistic approach does the job, but the combat feels sloppy and poorly programmed. Also the items scattered across the game don't feel well designed, the item fatigue system is tedious and finding different weapons aren't very rewarding because they'll break soon and you'll be back to using clumsy and low damage weapons again. The storyline isn't consistent and you'll miss the main objectives because of this, wandering around pointlessly.			"

												*Unplayable because of controls*I feel like this would've been a truly awesome game if the controls wouldn't be this terrible.In a combat, common behavior of following your target with mouse will make your attack type unpredictable, which also affects timing of the attack.If you don't want player to be able to change stab direction by more than N degrees while charging - that's fine, just perform the stab with the biggest angle change you allow. But *do not change the !@#$ing timing*			"

												This game is AWESOME, if u like platform games, and greek mythology, simply buy this, the combat is quite nice and there is alot of weapons to choose from (Axes, Swords, Javelins, spears, diffrent arrows / bows, and even ""magic weapons""), the controls are quite nice aswell, and simple, like switching between your melee wapons and ranged weapons with a click and a scroll with mouse wheel. There is alot to explore in the game which is quite nice.-You have a nice map of your surroundings aswell as an overall map, with quick travel.-You have diffrent ""swings"" with your equipped weapon (using the left mouse button) which furthermore is diffrent on the weapon u have equipped-You have shield equipped, which u can block with your right mouse button, and quickly switch to alternate offhand gear, like a torch.-And ofc. middle mouse button (if u have that on your mouse) is used to throw weapons, (javelins, spears), and so on.-Being able to pick up your thrown weapons or arrows.But beware, things break, so make sure u loot all u can..Design of the game is really nice, the levels / maps are well done, aswell as the lightning where the torch comes in handy :)Overall i'll give Apotheon a 10/10, its a brilliant game with awesome combat :)			"

Great example of how you can learn through gaming, and while I already knew a lot it prompted me to check out a few things I didn't know about greek mythology.The only bugs I've encountered is that throwing thunderbolts in water makes them float in air (which is hilarious), and a crash bug sometimes on transition, but I never lost any progress because of it.

												Gorgeous. I'm a sucker for pretty games, and Apotheon is an exquisitely pretty game. Pros: It's beautiful. The art style pulls you in and keeps you interested for a long time. There are lots of interesting mini-games, secret areas, unique challenges, and a mostly open map for exploring. Cons: Levels are a smidge too large, and the gameplay is quite long. This means the game risks over-staying its welcome as some of the levels can turn into a grind. Also the controls are clunky and can be intensely frustrating at first. You have to retrain your expectations for scroller controls and you have to use a mouse in order to enjoy the game. Unfortunately, despite being a scroller, this also makes the game almost impossible to play on a steam controller, which was a disappointment. That being said, it is a game that is absolutely worth purchasing and enjoying the presentation of, even if you end up not finishing it. Come for the artwork, stay for the artwork.			"

												I really loved this game; an interest for Greek mythology is certainly a big plus when buying it. If you're a little familiar with the subject you'll see lots of of small details and other nice things to enjoy in this already beautiful game. The environments are all very well designed and everything has its own feel while still staying true to the original art style, that of ancient Greek vases and pots. The combat is something to get used to, but it works. The music is also very athmospheric and really adds to the overall gameplay experience. The story is quite simple but well executed. At times I truly felt like a god amongst men. Just buy it.10/10 would become a god again			"

												I don't normally like side-scrollers, but I really enjoyed this game.I was initially enticed by the look of an ancient Greek amphora come to life, and I was pleased to see the mythological research evident in the story, accompanied by an excellent soundtrack.  The levels have just enough variety to keep them interesting, so that it's not just smacking more Greek dudes with a variety of weapons every time.I'm not sure why some people were unhappy with the combat.  I use keyboard + mouse, and the only problem I had was an occasional inability to hit an enemy because he was standing right on top of me, so that neither facing left or facing right could reach him.  Other than that, I enjoyed the block & attack mechanism that so often resulted in a dramatic *clang* *clang* as I exchanged blows with my foe, each of us using his shield to defend himself.  I also liked the way weapons broke, often forcing me to improvise when I lost the last weapon that was most effective against a particular enemy.The difficulty ramps up pretty evenly, so that you get more abilities at about the same rate as the enemies get stronger.  One thing I really enjoyed became evident in the boss fights.  In most games nowadays, you have about 5 seconds to figure out the strategy to defeat the boss before it kills you with one or two blows.  Every time in this game, when certain weapons were weak or useless against a boss, I had time to react to this and try something else, because I could still take a fair amount of punishment (even from a god).  Other games would do well to emulate this; it's far more exciting to devise a new strategy while in the middle of a fight than it is to do so while sitting on the Load screen.The Good:Oustanding art style capturing the essence of ancient Greek pottery illustrationMusicDepiction of gods and goddesses in accordance with literature of the timeInteresting combat systemHistorlcal weapons (love the sarissa) as well as fantastical onesVaried levels and objectives with some semi-open-world aspects (player choice and optional quests)Treasure hunting for completionistsReasonable autosave (in addition to manual saves)The Bad:Enemies can stand in the same place as you, making them unhittableSeveral crashes when attempting to load levelsCould use a good spell check "

												A brand new Greek epic.  Huge story, brilliant design, outstanding 2D open world to explore.Each level has a unique twist to it that makes it stand out (Hades has enemies that respawn, Zeus' Palace rains lightning down on you, Ares' lair has respawning enemies that fight each other, Poseidon's area is all aquatic with underwater enemies found nowhere else).  Though the game pretty much is made of branching destroy-this-kill-that quests, the ways you have to execute them are all different.  This makes every quest unique, and every area a surprise.Each boss fight is special as well, keenly balanced for just the right amount of challenge without ever becoming frustrating.  The final battle with Zeus is blissfully unfair, requires strategy and thought to win, and never made me ragequit.The story is simple, and in any other context would be cliched, but it's appropriate here.  Overthrowing the gods who decided humanity must be extinguished is grand, epic, and engrossing.  I had to know how it ended, and find out what happens to the people I met along the way.Combat takes some getting used to, and switching weapons or using health and potions during combat leaves you vulnerable.  There's no way to switch to a weapon or potion directly; you have to use the mouse wheel to scroll through your inventory, and that can make it frustrating to use something in the heat of battle.Platforming can be awkward with keyboard and mouse, and I didn't get used to it until the end of the game, but there's really no way around it.  Again, it is challenging, but never frustrating.Apotheon is superbly designed, well-balanced, and a joy to explore.			"

I find the game extremely hard and I have to find exploits to beat the bosses for about a quarter of the game, and the fact that it goes really slow, and to not much reward.			"

												With its unique art style, and simple (but extremely enjoyable) gameplay, Apotheon offers a very rich singleplayer experience, with a compelling story along with it. 10/10 would recommend for anyone who's remotely interested in Ancient Greel mythology, or action platformers in general!

												If you liked Greek myths as a kid or an adult, buy this game. I could go into detail about how the gameplay is simple but enjoyable, the music is great, and so on. But the highest praise I can offer is that this is THE game you need to buy if your interest was ever mythology. If that wasn't really your thing, then its pretty good otherwise. There's better out there, but this is a good and simple one to throw some time into.Note that it has some crashing issues. In one playthrough, four times it crashed to desktop. Luckily it saves at the beginning of every area, so at most I lost five minutes of gameplay.			"

												Apotheon was a little game that i'd never even known about up until its release. I believe I read a small review about it and shortly after checked out its Steam page. Immediately its art style hooked me as i've always been a fan of Roman and Greek mythology as well as their cultures. I also love the history and combat from the era and when I saw this game was done entirely in Greek mythology art style I decided I was going to go in blind on this game and just buy it there and then. It looked great and it met any expectations I had. It was a bit of a different game than I expected. Its a Metroidvania type game that is similar to a lot of the recent 2D platformers from the current era. Its challenging combat and beautiful art and animations immediately grabbed me and that was just the scratching the surface. As I got into the game I found it had more depth than I expected, varied weapons and items, fun secrets and side missions, great sound and voice acting and just a huge charm which made it feel so unique even though there are so many other Metroidvania games out there. Everything in the visuals department sets Apotheon apart from other games and its amazing animation quality plays into the combat and gives it a very, very deliberate and visceral feel. They really did an amazing job on it and it stood out to me through my entire experience. Its a combat system that is a bit finnicky at first, is so satisfying once accustomed to and difficult to master. The combat I really feel makes this game worth playing and truly was handled perfectly to match the style of this game. Apotheon also controls fantastically, again it took a bit of getting used to because the game is animation heavy but once you get used to it the feeling of momentum from running and jumping just feels wonderfully on keyboard or controller. The same can be said for the combat as each blow landed feels visceral and has impact. The combat is deliberate, every attack commits your character to the action so the combat takes on a bit of a Dark Souls feel where some thought and patience is required to really accell at it. The game features a fairly large number of bosses each with their own challenges. The game never felt like it was getting stale as it threw in new twists to the combat at every turn with new enemy types and new level types to fight in. In one level you can barely see, its pitch black and you only have a torch to light the way a few meters in front of you. In another level you're battling mermen under water which restricts your ability to use ranged weapons accept for one which was made for the mermen's use. The voice acting is top notch and every God character has personality and identities. The story was well done and well told with lots of cool lore and history on the Greek Gods and every weapon and piece of armor has its own model and there are a lot of them. Theres a crafting system for consumables but its nothing to write home about. And each level looks beautiful and feels unique for the most part. The levels can blend together a bit because of how consistent the art style is but the color pallete is great and there are awesome contrasts and colors to give the game a really great feeling of majesty and beauty.Pros --Great combat system. Satisfying and brutal, pretty easy to learn yet hard to master.-Tons of different weapons, shields, items and armor each with their own unique models.-Expansive levels with lots of secrets and items to be found as well as enemies to fight.-Varied enemies.-Great voice acting-Strong, well told story.-Beautiful art style and color scheme.-Authentic feeling environment.-Awesome final battle. Cons --Weak crafting system.-Boss fights can be unintuitive at first.-Combat encounters can get a little repetative at times though not often.-Normal difficulty isn't very challenging, I felt very overpowered by the end of the game.All in all this game is absolutely worth $15 for my money. It was bigger, badder and better than I expected it to be. It lasted about 15 hours for 1 play through though, its probably realistically closer to 10-12 hours. It has multiple difficulty settings for extra play time as well as a multiplayer mode. I've not tried the Multiplayer so I can't speak for it but if it uses the combat system and runs smoothly I imagine its a lot of fun. I just bought this game not expecting the amount of detail and care that I found once I played it and it really suprised me. It was one of my favorite suprises in gaming in recent memory and I'd recommend it to anyone. It really is a fantastic Indie and is so masterfully crafted that it deserves more attention than its gotten. I'm not big on giving a number score to games but if I had to give this game a scroe, i'd give it...8.5/10 "

												Gorgeous. I'm a sucker for pretty games, and Apotheon is an exquisitely pretty game. Pros: It's beautiful. The art style pulls you in and keeps you interested for a long time. There are lots of interesting mini-games, secret areas, unique challenges, and a mostly open map for exploring. Cons: Levels are a smidge too large, and the gameplay is quite long. This means the game risks over-staying its welcome as some of the levels can turn into a grind. Also the controls are clunky and can be intensely frustrating at first. You have to retrain your expectations for scroller controls and you have to use a mouse in order to enjoy the game. Unfortunately, despite being a scroller, this also makes the game almost impossible to play on a steam controller, which was a disappointment. That being said, it is a game that is absolutely worth purchasing and enjoying the presentation of, even if you end up not finishing it. Come for the artwork, stay for the artwork.			"

												Great art style, but I feel like the controls are just too clunky to be satisfying. Combat feels like 'wildly move around while spamming attack or wildly fling your ranged weapon at enemies' because the ranged reticle doesn't match where you shoot/throw. I only made it past the first 3 gods and got super bored with this game. The story doesn't really compel me to find out anything new about the world or care about anything in it (other than not dying). Character progression is also fairly lackluster; not skill or xp based, but how much gold and items you collect on your quests. Great overall idea, but the execution didn't follow through. Pick it up if you like art more than good games, I guess.			"

												This game looks interesting but...Has audio issues for someHas performance issues for someThree things bother me about this; firstly the developer tries to blame the issues on Microsoft XNA which is wrong based on the fact that no other game I have tried that uses Microsoft XNA has had these issues. Secondly with further research I have found that there are similar problems with this game on different platforms; Linux, Playstation 4, etc. Lastly, their previous game 'Capsized' also uses Microsoft XNA and works perfectly so what gives?The developer comes accross as if they don't have a clue about how the games internal audio/performance systems work; as if a third-party created the game engine for them. Therefore their only response so far is to superfluously put the blame away from the game. I have never had to disable hardware acceleration to get a game to work over the last fifteen years.Until they fix the issues I cannot recommend this game.			"

												I really wanted to love this game.There is only really one thing that killed it for me. The combat.Most enemies run around back and forth frantically, and I found myself mashing attack hoping the enemies would be in front of me when I swung. Doesn't help that most weapons take a while to swing.The point in which I turned it off, was fighting werewolves that did this grab and throw move by lunging at you. Annoying on its own, but when there are multiple in one room you're constantly thrown around with little way out.If they polished the combat, I would definitely recommend this game. Either way I wouldn't pay the full $15 they're asking when there are so many other great titles you can find for less.			"

												Apotheon is a game with an art style that's both unique and good looking. Everything feels right about the graphics and animations and it really does bring you into the mindset that this is a game about ancient greek mythology. The game has light RPG mechanics in where you can pick up multiple weapons and tools that are split into four categories; melee weapons, long ranged weapons, throwabale weapons/traps and potions/elixirs. The combat is pretty good, with fluid movement and some epic moments but it can get a little fiddly trying to change weapons in the middle of combat. It can also get quite annoying when some of your weapons overreach the enemies with weapons like the spear, the axe and the mace.What I would like to see is the ability to drop inferior weapons because scrolling to the right weapon can get frustrating when there's ten weapons between the one you want and with weapons breaking quickly you can't really set one as a primary. Spears should also stab and not get used as a club of some sort.			"

												Meh...This game seems like it could be interesting, but it's just lacking the polish necessary to make a good platformer.  One super important part to making a platformer enjoyable is mobility, I need to feel in complete control of my character.  You lose momentum whenever running over slight changes in terrain (e.g. from stairs to flat ground).  If you're running not in the direction of your mouse you move at cripplingly slow speeds.  The game just makes you feel clumsy.I'm personally not a huge fan of mouse-aim platformers, but if you are going to make such a game, the action has to be good enough to warrent the precise aiming mechanic.  I find it difficult to hit any given target, the mouse aiming seems more to get in the way than enhance the combat mechanics of the game.  I dunno, maybe it'd be more fun with a controller?			"

												This game has very clunky controls, VERY CLUNKY. I almost stopped playing because of that, but the art and soundtrack are so good, the story is interesting, so I continued to play because of those. But unfortunately I got to a part that after a few bosses, in order to progress, you need to find keys in game to open doors. Keys are dropped randomly and they have a very low drop ratio, so I gave up.I recommend buying on a sale because of the art and sountrack.			"

												I started this game excited about it. The originality caught my attention. The art style and soundtrack will be the only thing to save this game. The controls are clunky and unpredictable. The combat system doesn't make a lot of sense. I started this game and played through the entire thing in 1 day. The next day I figured I would go in and finish off the last achievement by completing an Olympian run. The game only lags more and more and gets more frustrating the longer you play(Not my PC, I can run any game without an issue). About 10 hours into my second playthrough my game crashed and when I went to reload, my save file wasn't there. I cannot suggest this game until most of these issues get resolved by the development team. I had high hopes and was disappointed.			"

The game seems to default to integrated graphics and cannot be forced to use a dedicated card - a problem other users have also raised in the Steam forums for this game.

												Sad to say, I am unable to enjoy this game. Bought it after my friend recommended it. Decided to play it while downloading XCOM 2. Game opened up just fine. Went to the settings, changed some very minor things, hit apply.Game crash.I tried it again. Again, game opens fine. I went to the settings and did the same thing, just to see if it would crash again. Guess what?It did.I try one final time, this time skipping the settings completely. I just decide to play the game. Fourteen minutes in, and I've started to enjoy myself. In fact, I've forgotten about the previous two crashes.  As long as I stay away from the settings, everything will be perfect. I'll meet a nice girl, go out with her, and eventually get married. We'll get a dog, and have a couple of kids. I'll finish college and go on to fulfill my dreams. I'll be happy... Fulfilled...  All is well and good... until Steam sends me a notification. Guess what happens.The game freaking crashes.Why? I don't know. I can't tell you. I couldn't read what the notification said, because the entire system froze up on me. And now, I still haven't met a girl, I don't have a dog, or any kids, I haven't completed college, I'm drowning in debt, I lost my left arm in a very dramatic shipping accident, my grandfather joined the American Nazi Party, and life is just awful!Screw you, Apotheon. You ruined my life.2/10 would crash again			"

												I *really* want to recommend this game on the fantastic visuals alone... but unfortunately the controls feel *so* loose and clumsy. This is basically a side-scrolling action game where your character feels floaty, weapon selection and switching is too difficult, and fights feel like rag dolls flailing at each other. The art style is *brilliant*, and *if* the tighten up the controls, it could be huge fun for anyone who likes a good side-scroller beat-em-up... but for now, you'll probably find it more frustrating than anything else.

												Initial impression:+Beautiful scenery+Interesting story-Strange unwieldy controls-Using weapons is incredibly frustrating. Sometimes I swing weapons at a normal decent speed, other times I wind up for two seconds before attacking, which allows enemies to hit me and interrupt my swing...over and over...it's horrid.Edit:Learned after a bit that you have a stamina bar which, if low, makes you swing your weapon like you actually want to die.  Anyway, doesn't make it any more of a fun mechanic.			"

												NOTE: Looks like the play timer is bugged Im sure i didnt play that long my ingame timer is much lower.Apotheon is an ancient greek action platformer. I dont like the art style, but i guess it fits the ancient greek theme. You can see it yourself in the trailer, if its a plus to you thats fine.Gameplay consists of going on various quests involving following arrows through the overworld to find mini dungeons scattered about that often have a boss in them and lots of purposeless corridors. Most of these quests never really had any explanation as to why I needed to do them, for example in the ""Hades"" area players must cross 4 rivers before fighting the areas boss. When you cross these rivers you come out back exactly where you started. It seem the only reason I had to do it was to add to the gameplay, not the story. However, many of these quests were very interesting and fun. This isn't nessicarily a fault. The problems come in with the platforming and combat.Platforming is quite obnoxious, it almost feels like im lagging but I dont think i am. Its very hard to move just a small amount or land on a small platform. Most areas are designed with ""Z"" shaped platforms, so youll often try to jump up onto one and lagging into the crook, because the jump didnt respond well. Also unresponsive is trying to down jump through a platform. This is very annoying when trying to run away. When you receive a big hit sometimes you go flying unpredictably. Also if your like me your used to roll jumping everywhere. Nope in this game you get to jump roll instead, thats a bit strange. There arent really that many parts in this game that require precise platforming anyways but its still annoying, especially on the final boss.Combat system is very simple but there are a ton of guards its much better to just run past most of them. When you do have to fight, despite the game insisting otherwise, you can just button mash with most weapons. Range weapons even have automatic aiming which is pretty OP. You can also make a ton of healing items using the crafting system. Even when you do die you aren't set back much by it.Theres this weird issue while trying to switch weapons while in combat where you cant do it while attacking. I would expect the game to finish the attack and then switch. When your weapon breaks this gets really annoying and makes it hard to use the more advanced potions at all.The UI also has weird overlapping issues very often.If your going to play it play it for an ancient greek story the gameplay is subpar. P.S. If your going to play it anyways you should note that the last difficulty is locked until you beat the game once but theres a bug you can do to skip to the final boss and get the acheivement for beating that difficulty without beating the whole game again.

												A game with amazing art and some original ideas, hampered by an unfortunately terrible and unwieldy combat system. Unless you want to strugle through every second of this game I can't reccomend it, the combat with, or without, a controller is just completely unbearable. If you were blessed with a third hand I can hardily reccomend this game for you though.			"

												I do really like this game, from what I played so far. The combat isn't as awkward as many people say, at least for me. I grasped the proper distance and how to get past shields by exploiting certain moves to get past an enemy's guard. However, what irritates me the most about this game is the lack of actual controller support. No matter what I do, my controller is not recognized by this game. It irks me that Outland another action 2D combat is the only game on Linux that has such amazing controller support! I would prefer to play this game with a controller, which is why I haven't really put a lot of hours into it. Keyboard and Mouse while usable, isn't what I prefer for these types of games thus I cannot recommend this game until the developer fixes this issue.			"

												A good game in gameplay sound and storywise. However, a fix from the developers is urgently needed for a gamebreaking glitch in the game. So, buyers beware that you may experience a gamebreaking glitch and thus cannot progress in the game any more.Wait for a fix and only then make your purchase.			"

The art style is wonderfully unique, everything from gameplay instructions on walls to Chronos god of time on loading symbols. But I just found the combination of mouse and keyboard controls very cumbersome, combat was just too clunky and unsatisfying.			"

												This is a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid game, and all the developers should ♥♥♥♥ing go to hell. I wish they get hit by trucks!I can't understand its stupid motion system, which makes every move flappy. You can't accurately know how far you may fly when you tap run, and you don't know when your hit would reach the enemy. It's just a mess.And what's more, the jumping motion is crazy and crappy. I can't make sure if I can jump and climb something. And the Hades part is a holy catastrophe. I don't understand what the developers were thinking about. The flames run up to chase you, good. But why is the fire COVERING EVERYTHING?????? Never let you see where your character is! This is ♥♥♥♥ing inhumane! You guys, fit these bugs, or just go die!			"

												This is a beautiful game. I feel like I'm playing a scrolling Greek vase or fresco.I get a strong Metroidvania vibe about this game. It's like an action-oriented Mark of the Ninja.The level design is that there's a hub from which you can reach several zones, and those zones themselves are hubs to a few more, small zones where you complete your tasks before moving on. It's a great flow.My only con is a little one. The weapon management is a little jankey. At some points you can be juggling 20 items in 4 colums, but I guess this is motivation to complete your weapon loadout before battle. But then sometimes there's no saving mid-zone, so you can get killed trying to select a weapon.Ultimately I say this is a must buy. I've spent all afternoon playing it and I look forward to my next session.			"

Combat and movement just feels way too clunky compared to say, Guacamelee and Outland.			"

												This game is so beautiful that the gods of Olympus cursed mankind in a jealous rage.Also, it's fun.  Apotheon is about the Gods withdrawing their support from he mortal realm, and one man's quest to...convince them otherwise.  I've been convincing a lot of gods with my xiphos sword. xD Fun, story-driven side-scrolling action reminescent of Castelvania or similar titles.  The art is perfect and on point, as is the voice acting, and the combat.  It's simple combat, mind you, nothing like the Arkham titles, of course.  But it's all polished, and it's all pretty fun!

												This is an outstanding game, i'm quite impressed and would like to thank developer team for their work.Pros: Fluent controls(i play with xbox controller)Beautiful art and graphicsGood plot(i was quite touched in the end)Satisfying combat system with lots of disposable weaponry, there are bows, spears, swords, etc, all authentic ancient greek like sarissa, kopis, leaf-shaped xiphos etc. Exploration is fun and is rewarded Huge game deph: you can craft traps, potions, magic items that will summon allies, and a lot more.Made with love to Greek mythology, there are a lot of quotes from ancient sourses, nothing in game feels off.Level design and boss battles are outstanding, unique and epic. Fighting Poseidon and labirynth of Athena are my favourites.Music is very atmospheric and melodic, i loved the harp main theme, the vocal parts in Agora and clay drums in Poseidon's level. Also you can play local arena versus friend!I found no cons, mb only that the game is poorly advertised. "

												I don't usually write reviews, but this game deserves one.It's graphics are gorgeous as it replicates greek arts and style. Combat is clever and kept fresh since it forces you to constantly use different weapons since they have limited duribility. You might think this will be annoying, but it isn't. Each type of weapon are good in their own way. I ended up using maybe around 15 different kind of melee weapons by the end of the game; this includes tridents, flaming swords, iron rods, and spears (my favorite). I can say the same for ranged weapons as well. You can use arrows, hatchets, and more.The map design is well done. In the grand scheme of things, the entire map is split into themes that match a personality of the associated gods. Ares, god of war, rules over a bloody, trap-filled, chaotic battler areana. Athena, goddess of wisdom, has a revolving maze. Each theme can and will change the way you battle your enemies.The story is brought to life thanks to the great voice acting. If you have played God of War, this story will seem very similar since you have to deal with different gods.Overall I would definitely recommend this game! If you have around 10-12 hours of spare time, use it on Apotheon.			"

Doing those optional bosses will unlock better gear to make progress easier. There is alot of combat in this game, which I enjoyed, however, at times the combat is frustrating. The animations are somewhat clunky, which makes striking your enemies difficult sometimes. Still, the game as a whole overcomes the somewhat bad combat.

												Apotheon----------A great platformer, its strong points are its beautiful design, music track and story. The game gives you a mood that you are exploring a mythic world and you are going to tear the gods from their rule.The music accompanied with this game fits that mood perfectly.You gather armor tiers and you can craft potions which may boost you or summon allies. The armor system is done pretty nice, once you gather higher tier armor, your total armor level expands. That means that once you can still wear your other armor purely for cosmetic reasons while retaining the armor level. There is no experience or statistics system, but the game does not really need that.You do get an array of weaponry with names that stem from ancient Greece. Spears are Doru, swords are Xiphos, etc.The controls are a little floaty, but the developers have taken away frustrations that other platformers have. When you reach the edge of a platform, you hang off of it and you can gradually slide down or climb up.Something I did not really like was the fact that you assault guards who clearly are not hostile to you unless you attack them first. It made me feel a bit like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to attack them first just so I can progress in the game. But this is just my opinion. Ingame, I missed the classic monsters like the Centaur, Pegasus, Minotaur, Manticore, Hydra and the Medusa Gorgon. I was hoping to fight those as well.Furthermore the Steam achievements for Apotheon are a little too easy to gather.----------Nevertheless, Apotheon is a godly game and I really recommend it to anyone into Metroidvania games.

												A great game; and as others have said, the art and music are amazing so make sure you snap up the soundtrack on your way to the checkout, especially if it's on sale.This game has controller support, which I would recommend you use (I used X360). The combat is a little strange and unintuitive for this genre so be prepared to get used to what controls like a twin-stick shooter X platformer (you pretty much have to manually tell your character to face either left or right and up or down using the right-stick).Boss battles are quite tricky; I rage-quitted the Artemis one a couple of times. At least there's god mode in the console commands.Good mythology too.8/10			"

												Qualifications: finished game on normal difficulty in 7 hoursApotheon is a 2D action-rpg game with great style. The plot was reminiscent of God of War. The voice acting is solid which surprised me for a budget game. The best thing in my opinion was the sence of exploration the game provides. Theres so many side quests and collectables. The combat is a bit to get used to but is definetly managable. The game has some great set pieces and boss battles with varying scale. Some I'd say are pretty clever and interesting in how they're approached.  There is a crafting system and upgrade system in the game. I did not really use the crafting system much in my first playthrough though. The only real flaw the game has is the fact that weapons degrade. All weapons can be bought at shops in the game but when going through an area, its very possible to be finished with your favorite weapon a third through. This was probably most apparent in the last level when I had to go through I'd say 6 weapons just to reach the boss.			"

												I haven't played a lot of the game, as you may tell, however, in the short time that I did, I can tell you that the game has a great art style and is quite easy to get the hang of. Personally, I reckon its best played with a gamepad (I used an Xbox 360 controller) But a mouse and keyboard works just fine. The mechanics of the game are interesting, although not exactly groundbreaking as far as 2D platformers go.All in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a Hellenic, bloodthirst platformer to play, without wanting to put 110% effort into it.

												To anyone who is a fan of Metroidvania style games, you should seriously consider this game. The art style is beautiful and the attention to detail really surprised me as it looks rather basic at first glance. It's also very true to the art style it was trying to replicate (Ancient Greek). Combat is very fun. It's not real in depth, but it's not simple either. Story doesn't have much to it, Zeus turns his back on the people and you, a mortal, travel to Olympus to fight the gods, but it doesn't feel lacking in any way, not to mention the voice acting is very well done.

												Lovely art direction, that's the first thing you notice about Apotheon. Then you notice the slightly janky combat system, although this improves with practice (and when you get more powerful weapons). The level design is imaginative, although the fundamentals of buildings and furniture don't change that much. Good boss fights (except for the running-deer one which highlights the difficulty of moving downwards). And good ending. Overall, good-to-very-good, and worth a shot.			"

												The concept of a greek mythology-inspired game may sound run-of-the-mill, but Apotheon is anything but. The game is a metroidvania type of action-platformer, but uses very little rpg elements, which simplifies the mechanics for players new to the genre.Your character does not level up, rather he gains extra health/protection and powers by upgrading his armor and weapons, and even honing his skill with select weapons such as the xiphos (sword) or spear.You move with the standard WASD, but use the mouse to aim, attack and block; this can be confusing for players who haven't experienced this type of controls, and this ends up muddling the combat. Often, the player will be stabbing blindly at the air, simply because the cursor isn't at the proper elevation. Likewise, this can affect the player's speed when moving if the cursor isn't in the direction the player is headed.The combat is not turn based, and most enemies can be dealt with only a few strikes of a sword or spear. However, enemies can pile up quickly and this is bothersome as running away is seldom a viable option considering the difficulties linked to platforming. The player is armed with only a modest jump and a stunted ledge grab to go through the levels.The visual style is deceptively modest, taking on the the style of ancient greek pottery of colour-on-black. The characters move mostly fluidly, bar some repeated motions during dialogues, and the background is almsot always filled with  ancient greek forests, cities and the like.Overall, Apotheon is a game that will frustrate the player in order to push them to do their best. The sometimes frustrating combat mechanics or platforming physics are easily overshadowed by the amazing visuals, immersive story and engaging gameplay.			"

												Holy mother of power fantasies, this game is amazing.The story is based on ancient Greek mythology, though it is not the game's strongest point. The combat is very satisfying and generally fantastic. It reminds me very much of the combat system in Dark Souls, but instead, it's in 2D.The player takes the role of Nikandreos, who wakes up in the middle of a siege on his home village by bandits. After killing these bandits, you learn that the gods have forsaken humanity and no longer wish for them to exist. Upon going into the temple, Hera appears in front of Nikandreos and tells him that they could form a partnership. She has had enough of Zeus cheating on her with other deities and even mortals, while Nikandreos has an interest in humanity not being wiped out. Hera teleports Nikandreos to the gates of Olympus, where he is tasked with gathering the strenght of all the major gods around and prepare to overthrow Zeus, the king of gods, himself.As you can see from the pictures and the trailers, the game has a unique artstyle in that it looks like ancient Greek pots. The soundtrack supports this artstyle and setting very well and the sound effects are very good.One thing to note with this game is that the bossfights are very cool and unique. This does not go for minibosses sadly, as they're mainly just something bigger than everything else and otherwise behave as all others.Overall, I had a blast.			"

The story on top of that is awsome and makes you genuinley feel like you're a character in a greek myth with an ending that left me speechless(not spoiling it).    Overall it's a great experience which is defintley worth the $15, Don't make the same mistake I made with taking the long wait for it to be on sale, IT IS A MUST BUY!5/5 A great experience that we're lucky is at this low of a price for this good of an experience.

												I had seen mixed thoughts on this game, but thought I would give it a try.I'm always very interested in ancient greek mythology, so that in itself is a major draw to this game. While the story is very reminiscent of another greek mythology game (*cough* God of War *cough*), the way it was presented set it on its own.The art style is awesome, it's bold colors and just oozes with greek influence. It felt like I was playing a story book that was made by the ancient greeks themselves.  There is a nice variety of locals as well as your move throughout the story. While the graphics looked great, there were some slowdown issues with the framerate despite having a fairly powerful PC. They would come at random times, independant of what was going on during that particular moment.The other part of the game that made it a very positive experience for me was the combat. Its difficult, it has a high learning curve (in my opinion), but its *satisfying*. Once you figure out how you have to space yourself for different weapon types, and how you have to actually aim your ranged weapons, it becomes very natural. I was FRUSTRATED at first, so expect that, but know the more you practice with it, the better the game becomes. You can't expect to just run in and kill everything without timing your attacks and blocks, or you'll die horribly (as I did at first).There were a couple annoyances with the game I should mention too. For one, unless I missed some control, the map can't be moved around to search the area. This makes looking through a large map impossible, which is necessary sometimes when trying to figure out where treasure chests are, where an objective is located at specifically, or if you've already gone a certain way. Second, the weapon breaking system. It adds a degree of realism, and it allows you to try different weapons when one breaks, but it still was annoying. I enjoyed playing with the sword the most, but it always broke way too easily. I understand what the devs were trying to do with it, but it just detracts from the fun a bit in my opinion.TL;DR Overall, the game is a lot of fun, with great unique graphics, and very fun gameplay. The story is not very unique, but enjoyable. The map could use some tweaks, and the weapon breakage system detracts from the fun a bit. Still a highly recommended game!9/10			"

												By now it's likely that you've heard of Apotheon's art style. If not, it is the single most remarkable thing about this game. The whole thing is designed to look like an ancient Greek vase, and it is most effective. The primary colors are orange and black, to resemble the clay and dark ink of the artifacts, with blue on the protagonist's armor and red on those of the enemies, along with occasional changes in background color as is appropriate for each setting (Green for the forest, blue for the sea, and so on.) The art style and animation generate a terrific atmosphere, as well, ancient and mystical and desolate and hopeless. Aesthetically, Apotheon is an absolute masterpiece and deserves every mote of the attention it's gotten.The story is also excellent. With the dawning of the Iron Age, the Gods of Olympus are none too pleased with the direction that humanity has taken, and like Zeus's Christian counterpart, have decided to punish mankind with extinction. Demeter makes it so that nothing will grow, Poseiden stirs up the seas, Apollo denies the Earth light, and Artemis keeps the forests wanting for game. Enter Nikandreos, the hero. He wakes as his home village, Dion, is under attack by raiders. After defending the Temple of Hera from the outsiders, the Queen of Olympus charges Nikandreos with overthrowing Olympus and saving mankind. I won't say any more. While this isn't a game with a great many twists and turns, the development of the story is something you should uncover for yourself. The key here is that the developers really know their stuff when it comes to the Hellenic gods. Each one you meet fits their classical characterization to a tee, and this creates a number of great scenarios, my personal favorite being the Artemis boss fight. None of the gods are simplified or lionized as they have been in a great many modern sources, (God of War or Disney's Hercules this is not) and many of them have aligned against Zeus' abandonment of humanity. In addition, there is a liberal scattering of passages from classical Greek sources throughout the game, each placed to give you a clear impression of the particular obstacle or characters you'll be facing shortly. All in all, while the story itself may not be groundbreaking, it's well researched, well written, and creative, and is a joy to watch unfold.The gameplay is where Apotheon falls a little flat. Most of the time it's fine, your classic action platformer with just enough backtracking and exploration that it could be called a Metroidvania (Though that doesn't quite fit). There are two hubs, the Agora and the Acropolis, with a shop, and each is connected to three major levels each based around a particular god, as well as both having two optional gods each: Aphrodite and Dionysus in the Agora and Hermes and Hephaestus in the Acropolis. These aren't required for the core plot but they are fun, help flesh out the world and each bestows you with a useful upgrade.The place where the game falls short is the combat, specifically. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but it was simply clunkier than it had to be. Essentially, you have three attacks, an uppercut, an overhead strike, and a thrust, in addition to a shield bash. With the exception of the shield bash, which is done by pressing the middle mouse button with the shield up, the rest are far too difficult to pull off consistently or accurately. For example, the overhead attack is done by moving the mouse up and attacking, the uppercut involves moving it down, and the thrust is done by keeping it still. The problem is, the mouse is also used for aiming the attack and controlling the direction Nikandreos is looking. Couple that with highly mobile enemies, a problem that only worsens late in the game with the introduction of flying enemies, and this means that you'll have a hard time predicting exactly how your strike will come out or where it will go. The best thing to do is ""trade blows"", attack, shield, attack, shield, and so on and so forth. However, this can be problematic in the frequent case that you're facing more than one enemy. At that point, I just used the bow and cheesed everything.This isn't fatal, and once you get the hang of it, can be pretty fun. It's just something that will catch you by surprise and can annoy you throughout the game. The other thing to know about the combat is the weapon system. This is not a negative point, but it will be a turn off for some players. Rather than having set weapons that you unlock and can use indefinitely, you have a wide selection of weapons that will break after some use. This has two effects on gameplay: First, you must be a generalist. You can't just stick with the Doru (Spear) or Xiphos (Sword), unless you want to put a great deal of effort into making sure you always have decent durability. Second, you have to learn to preserve the most powerful weapons for the situations where you need them, like you might save the BFG ammo in Doom rather than using it on an imp. As I said, it's not a mark against the game, it's just something not everyone will like.Is Apotheon a masterpiece? Certainly as a work of art. As a game, no, there's plenty of room for improvement. However, while it isn't perfect, it's still a very good time. Hell, the aesthetic alone is worth any gamer's time. I recommend it without reservation. Check it out, I think you'll like it.			"

												Such a surprisingly fun game! It's not exactly 2D God of War as people mention, as the combat is a little more tactical and weighty. I would say it's closer to the dark souls kind of combat, although still quite far from it.You play as Nikandreos, a simple dude who chooses to stand up against a rampaging Zeus. You basically have three attacks (overhead, stab, uppercut-ish swing), but there are many different types of weapons with different reaches, attack speeds and damages. You could also ignore melee weapons and go ranged. There's definitely a lot of variety to the combat. The art style stands out in the game, it looks really beautiful, especially in some places where you can see things like birds among the clouds, and sun rays and stuff. The voice acting is quite nice, and the music too. Overall it's a great game that I enjoyed playing, and I'm looking forward to Alientrap's next game!My only gripe was the final fight, without spoilers.. let me just say it forces you to use a sword and a shield, and that was not my fighting style the whole game. It took me around 30 minutes of repitition to finish it.To sum up: I loved the game, loved the story, visuals, combat, weapons, voice acting. I would definitely recommend it!			"

												First impressions after playing a couple hours.-Good 2-D graphics and art (but too many areas look very similar, just different colors)-Good combat, weapons long-short ranged, shields and abilities-Good area maps and direction indictors so not walking around trying to figure out where to go or what to do next.-Good music, history and atmosphere.-Can get a bit repetitive after a hour or so, best in smaller doses.It reminds me of the game Outland, as far as 2-D gameplay.  Its not the best game on the market, but if searching for something different, you have the time-its easy to pick up and play in quick short doses and for a reasonable price then its certainly worthwhile.8.5/10 based on price, style and for basic indie game standards.

Huge variety of weapons and modifiers (regular vs heroic) grade weapons.  Lot's of fighting style. Great bosses, and hidden places everywhere.  The game was challenging, but not overly so to the point where I couldn't advance. There is Champion difficulty if you are a masochist.  Very good game, very epic, a little short.

												If I had to describe Apotheon in one word, it'd be fun.  Plain and simple, good ol' fashioned fun.Don't come into this game looking for an immersive novel-like story---it's just not there.  But like a beautifully illustrated children's book, Apotheon shines in its simplicity, style, and sense of adventure.  It's fun to play, and fun to watch.  The controls are simple and fluid.  The scenes are beautifully rendered in the style of Greek art.  It's truly a joy to behold.The soundtrack doesn't disappointment either, with a host of tunes that totally immerse the player into the environment, and convey the excitement (and sometimes anxiety), as you pit your mortal self against the mighty gods of Olympus.It's a must for any fans of Greek mythology, or anyone who enjoyed the Iliad or Odyssey.  Fans of simple, but fun adventure games will also find a lot to like here, as well as anyone who can appreciate games as art.To be fair, the story narrative could have been better integrated into the entirety of the game.  At times, it comes off feeling slightly arbitrary, or disjointed.  The side-plots also feel a bit confusing, and it's not clear most of the time how they fit in.  But, on the whole, the story is cogent, and it works for what the game is.  Again, in keeping with my earlier metaphor, think Chris Van Allsburg, not Leo Tolstoy.  My final grade for this beautifully rendered Greek odyssey:  B+.			"

												TLDR; 10/10, it's worth owning. Fist off, this game is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The art style is incredible, with a greek pottery vibe that I adore. The effect of the screen cracking when you get injured is a genius addition, and the 2D simplicity with the perfect colour schemes... well, I could go on for hours, but you get the point.The mythological aspect of the game is amazingly well done, I adore greek mythos and this is one of the best representations I've seen in a long time. Playing as Hera's champion against Zeus- perfect. It balances accuracy with interest perfectly, with occasional optional text to view from the original sources, such as homeric hyms.The soundtrack is perfect for the game, fitting incredibly well with the different scenes, and I'm actually about to buy the soundtrack dlc since it's on sale at the moment. The voice acting is fairly good, and if it's not your thing you can skip the speaking by clicking/pressing space/some other control if not on keyboard.I would guess that the fighting in this game works best with a controller, it's not impossible with a mouse but it takes  a bit of getting used to. If there's one tip I can give you, it's not to button mash/click repeatedly. Your attacks will lose power, and you won't even hit them most of the time - make sure you time your attacks carefully and vary your weapon choices, and keep on your toes to face your attacker!Overall a solid 10/10 for this game- I bought it on sale, but I'd say it's worth the full price, or at least worth putting on your wishlist until it comes on sale again.

												Nice Game. If you play it straight through with only looking left and right a little bit, you're finished within 6 hours. But if you want to explore and complete all the side missions, it will take a lot more time. I loved the style and the different weapons and armor.Can be played very aggressive (i.e. killing everyone) or very calm and sneaky.8/10			"

												Wow, this game demonstrates how to do boss battles. Every boss battle is unique (With Hades being the one exception); being turned into a Stag and hunted by Artemis, fighting Apollo in pitch darkness guided by his attacks and your torch, fighting a giant Poseidon as he throws your ship like a ragdoll in the ocean, being chased by Ares through a series of death traps, commanding an army against Athena, every boss in this game takes the formula and makes it fresh. If the entire rest of the game sucked it would STILL get this recommendation for the masterfully crafted boss battles alone.Get this game, especially if it's on sale. A word of warning, though; you literally cannot progress through the second half of the game without Lockpicks, so use them judiciously. They do drop randomly if you run out, but still.			"

Furthermore it has a fun and intresting storyline and world that will keep you entertained and amazed. I'd love to see the multiplayer fully finished, but even in its current state its still very fun, (a little buggy, but hey its in beta still). Regardless, Apatheon is a must have for anyone who enjoys combat games, greek mythology and warfare, or heroic stories. 9.5/10			"

												Great art style and captivating music. However the controls are really tough to get used to almost to the point that you stop trying. It is also a game that snowballs... Make some continuous mistakes and you will end up having no proper equipment and searching for a shield that covers more than just your torso. This however works both ways, manage to go pretty well for some time and you'll end up with loads of money you don't know what to do with and a huge arsenal that simply won't end. 7,5/10...			"

												Firstly. my review mostly lists the problems I had, since you're probably already interested in the game for whatever reason and wondering what might be bad about it.  I definitely played the game all the way through and enjoyed it, especially the boss fights.  The art style is brilliant, and the story is interesting enough (although I don't expect anything epic from a platformer).  I played with an Xbox 360 controller and the movement and controls are mostly solid.The combat was a bit awkward.  It's just impractical to try to aim your weapon AND shield properly with the right thumbstick at the same time while moving around with the left.  I never got used to it.  The weapon switching with a controller is a joke too.  It's impossible to accurately choose one of dozens of weapons with the d-pad in the middle of combat.   You have to pause the game and switch in the inventory screen if you don't want to be carved up while finding the right weapon.  The being said, the combat does take a little bit of brains to know when to attack and with what against whom.My biggest problem was the weapon/shield breaking mechanic.  Some weapons are more useful against a lot of foes, and some are kind of niche.  You tend to want to save the useful ones for potentially harder fights because they break so fast.  This means sometimes you're using terrible weapons against certain weaker foes just to hold onto the good weapons.  Shields break way too fast for you to be blocking with any regularity as well.  You do get a fair bit of replacement weapons, but you never know when the next good weapon or good shield is coming up, so I tended to try to conserve, which threw any battle strategy in the trash (there are so many health potions you can just keep healing instead of fighting well).  I feel like it would be a lot more fun if at least shields (and preferably weapons) were indestructible, because then you could use the weapons/shields to fit the strategy per enemy instead of playing resource management.  It's not unplayable by any means, just a moderate annoyance.			"

												Such a surprisingly fun game! It's not exactly 2D God of War as people mention, as the combat is a little more tactical and weighty. I would say it's closer to the dark souls kind of combat, although still quite far from it.You play as Nikandreos, a simple dude who chooses to stand up against a rampaging Zeus. You basically have three attacks (overhead, stab, uppercut-ish swing), but there are many different types of weapons with different reaches, attack speeds and damages. You could also ignore melee weapons and go ranged. There's definitely a lot of variety to the combat. The art style stands out in the game, it looks really beautiful, especially in some places where you can see things like birds among the clouds, and sun rays and stuff. The voice acting is quite nice, and the music too. Overall it's a great game that I enjoyed playing, and I'm looking forward to Alientrap's next game!My only gripe was the final fight, without spoilers.. let me just say it forces you to use a sword and a shield, and that was not my fighting style the whole game. It took me around 30 minutes of repitition to finish it.To sum up: I loved the game, loved the story, visuals, combat, weapons, voice acting. I would definitely recommend it!			"

												First impressions after playing a couple hours.-Good 2-D graphics and art (but too many areas look very similar, just different colors)-Good combat, weapons long-short ranged, shields and abilities-Good area maps and direction indictors so not walking around trying to figure out where to go or what to do next.-Good music, history and atmosphere.-Can get a bit repetitive after a hour or so, best in smaller doses.It reminds me of the game Outland, as far as 2-D gameplay.  Its not the best game on the market, but if searching for something different, you have the time-its easy to pick up and play in quick short doses and for a reasonable price then its certainly worthwhile.8.5/10 based on price, style and for basic indie game standards.

A story line of you overthrowing the Gods of Olympus, very good story, very good lore.  Great graphics/sounds. Combat is great.  Huge variety of weapons and modifiers (regular vs heroic) grade weapons.  Lot's of fighting style. Great bosses, and hidden places everywhere.  The game was challenging, but not overly so to the point where I couldn't advance. There is Champion difficulty if you are a masochist.  Very good game, very epic, a little short.

												After a string of underwhelming and overpriced games I come across this one. Finally, a game worth its price. This game is very well polished and the controls are great. This game is recommended for all fans of half life, team fortress 2, wolfenstein, and even call of duty players..... now hold on a moment you might say, this is a platformer not a FPS, why would I recommend this to FPS players? Well the reason is simple. The game, and especially the controls, feel exactly like a FPS. you attack with left mouse button, use secondary with right mouse. use tertiary with middle mouse. item selection is 1,2,3, and 4. movement is WASD, save is F5, load is F9, jump is spacebar.... this is for all intents and purposes an FPS that has been flattened into 2D and I actually cannot recommend this to people who are not fans of FPS games regardless of whether you like platformers or not.

												I love this game unconditionally. I study history at my university, and I love Ancient Greece especially, and I could not stop geeking out over this game. It looks gorgeous, the story is great, and it is one of the most faithful approaches to the Greek myths I've ever seen. On top of that, it's damn fun. Athena's Labyrinth was probably my favorite zone, with all the cool skill challenges, but I was also a fan of the Underworld. The music and lighting down in Hades sometimes made me feel legitimately uneasy, and crossing the River Lethe was slow and tense without being frustrated. My only complaint is that the controls can be a bit sluggish when fighting, which is a bit of a problem in a platformer. Even then, combat made me feel like a badass. I should note, however, that I only played with an XBox controller, so a keyboard and mouse may be quicker and more precise. Other than that, no complaints. As a historian and lover of myth who loves to nitpick, I only noticed two historically inaccurate things: In the game, the sarissa can be held one-handed and thrown, and the pelta is carried on the arm. Besides the fact that these weapons were introduced in Macedonia several centuries after when this game seems to be set, the sarissa required two hands to use, and the pelta (which was invented to be used with the sarissa) was slung over the shoulder. But I digress. Long story short, play this game. Great story, great music, great history, and all-around fun.			"

Yes, the fighting combat is a little clunky but you get thousands (not actually) different types of weapons to harness your ability to fight your enemies...The shield mechanic is KEY and feels so nice to block incoming attacks with. The story is simple yet intriguing as you ascend higher into Mount Olympus, opening up more levels to go to, mostly in any order you want, making your way to Zeus.10/10 for not letting me down with the ending.

												Pretty solid game! A fun sort of platformer with interesting, albeit clunky, combat. Took me about 12 hours to finish and I didn't quite unlock everything. Plenty of exploration and finding of secrets and weapons. It's kind of an interesting game, in which commiting crime seems to be the favorable choice, as it gets you the most stuff. (I guess it makes sense, since your'e essentially killing off the gods anyways.)The big thing I'd change is the combat system. It doesn't make any sense. See, for the most part you've got an overhead, underhand, and (if you've got a weapon with a pointy bit at the end) a thrust. I don't entirely know how to trigger the over and under attacks, as the game doesn't say how. This can be a little troublesome, as you can hit walls, damaging the durability of your weapons. I recommend sticking to thrust attacks, as all you have to do is click to trigger that, it attacks further and doesn't collide with walls near as much. Also getting the item from Hermes and using it is... weird at times, erratically breaking and allowing you to break the game in some locations.Other than that, the voice acting is solid. The asthetic is great! It's like you're playing on an old Greek urn. The gameplay can still be fun, even if it's a little clunky. Give it a go if you like platformers with combat! Just don't be too aggresive on harder difficulties and work your dodge roll.			"

												Despite not usually enjoying platformers or the ""Metroidvania"" style of games, I found Apotheon a real treat. The visual presentation of the game is enough to recommend the game by itself -- the art style and animation are really something. The story is interesting, and blends elements of Greek mythology while creating its own narrative. Sound design and music are both quite good, as well. The combat is basic, but engaging enough -- the various classes of weapons each have their strengths, and fights are all about timing and range. With one or two enemies it can be a bit tactical, but when more start piling up it can start to become a bit of a tangle, where you're not certain what (if any) effect you're having.That's a minor quibble, however, and the game's length means you'll be finished with the epic (and for a nice change, that word is appropiate!) story before they start to detract from the experience. The absolutely beautiful art style combined with fun exploration, some interesting puzzles (I particularly enjoyed Athena's challenges), and decent combat gave me a enjoyable experience that I would recommend to others.

												Qualifications: finished game on normal difficulty in 7 hoursApotheon is a 2D action-rpg game with great style. The plot was reminiscent of God of War. The voice acting is solid which surprised me for a budget game. The best thing in my opinion was the sence of exploration the game provides. Theres so many side quests and collectables. The combat is a bit to get used to but is definetly managable. The game has some great set pieces and boss battles with varying scale. Some I'd say are pretty clever and interesting in how they're approached.  There is a crafting system and upgrade system in the game. I did not really use the crafting system much in my first playthrough though. The only real flaw the game has is the fact that weapons degrade. All weapons can be bought at shops in the game but when going through an area, its very possible to be finished with your favorite weapon a third through. This was probably most apparent in the last level when I had to go through I'd say 6 weapons just to reach the boss.			"

												This is one of my favourite games. Great art and story, plus the mechanics mesh really well with both. Great level design and GREAT MUSIC. The combat and collecting is fun. Very atmospheric. I used to read a lot of greek myths and nothing made me go: EH. So pretty awesome interpretations and the quotes are definitely a nice touch. (Although where the hell was Hestia?? she always gets forgotten haha).ONE WARNING: you cannot play this on the computer with mouse and keyboard. The sensitivity of the mouse is appallingly low and it cannot be changed. You need a controller. Which is really unfortunate because that means a lot of auto-aim and a lot less accuracy. It's doable though. I just don't understand how that happened, because the rest of the game is so polished.Just wish I could have taken Artemis and Athena and all the pretty friendly gods into my new pantheon and only kicked out Zeus, Apollo, (Hera), Poseidon and Ares. That would have been nice (though not the point of the game obviously). What would REALLY be an improvement is if the multiplayer mode also had nymphs, like it has satyrs.			"

												I tend to be rather verbose with my reviews so I will attempt to keep this one short.I complete the single player game this weekend on normal difficultly, I have not played the online multiplayer so this review will be standing on the merrits of the single player alone.Bare in mind that I was using an X Box pad, I would not recomend playing without some sort of controller.Pros- Good story even with silent protagonist, manages to create its own plot while been very loyal to source material.- Great artwork and level design, music is atmospheric but you won't remember it after leaving the game.- Moderate difficulty platforming, secrets can be spotted with careful eye or by paying attention to map.- Antifrustration features in final level, respawning you on platform if you are unlucky enough to be knocked off platforms.- Auto Save everytime you enter an area.- Good selection of weapons, shields and usuable items though some do seem a little pointless at times.- Fast load and save times, remarkably so compared to the usual 45 seconds to 2 minute wait I've had to put up with in more recent games.- No issues with controller input, worked from the start with no problemsCons- Frequent Crashes to menu when changing areas which then usually followed by a crash to desktop when attempting to continue game.- Combat whilst fun can quickly grow tiresome at times since foes can backpeddle as fast as you can move and the combat system doesn't favour big group combat with difficulties in aiming and swapping weapons.- Selecting weapon/item method is clunky if you don't wish to pause everytime due to the large amount of items to scroll through.- Summons are not avaliable in many areas when you want them most.- Two or three side quests are a little vague if your achievement hunting.- Story isn't entirely clear for people with a lack of knowledge in Greek mythology and may make the ending seem weak.- The Olympian achievement. Seriously I just spent 11-12 hours beating your game and you want me to replay the whole thing on a new unlocked difficulty? With nothing else new apart from dying really quickly? This is a crappy throw back to old gaming, either have the Olympian difficulty unlocked from the start or make it a new game +.			"

												Apotheon----------A great platformer, its strong points are its beautiful design, music track and story. The game gives you a mood that you are exploring a mythic world and you are going to tear the gods from their rule.The music accompanied with this game fits that mood perfectly.You gather armor tiers and you can craft potions which may boost you or summon allies. The armor system is done pretty nice, once you gather higher tier armor, your total armor level expands. That means that once you can still wear your other armor purely for cosmetic reasons while retaining the armor level. There is no experience or statistics system, but the game does not really need that.You do get an array of weaponry with names that stem from ancient Greece. Spears are Doru, swords are Xiphos, etc.The controls are a little floaty, but the developers have taken away frustrations that other platformers have. When you reach the edge of a platform, you hang off of it and you can gradually slide down or climb up.Something I did not really like was the fact that you assault guards who clearly are not hostile to you unless you attack them first. It made me feel a bit like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to attack them first just so I can progress in the game. But this is just my opinion. Ingame, I missed the classic monsters like the Centaur, Pegasus, Minotaur, Manticore, Hydra and the Medusa Gorgon. I was hoping to fight those as well.Furthermore the Steam achievements for Apotheon are a little too easy to gather.----------Nevertheless, Apotheon is a godly game and I really recommend it to anyone into Metroidvania games.

												This game is everything I never knew I wanted. Back when it was released, I dismissed it as ""just another metroidvania game"" banking on its unique aesthetic. I bought it on a whim much later, and fell in love. This game has a stunning art style, and unique(ish) combat. Strikes have to be planned deliberately, as there is some (intentional) input lag. Boss battles are memorable and well designed (with a couple exceptions). The story is bare bones but has some great moments. Not for everyone but then nothing is. If you like Greek mythology and metroidvania games pick this one up.			"

												8/10- Really awesome-Apotheon is an ancient Greek artstyled game and has such a unque feel to it. The the story is interesting but is pretty meh. The world you can explore is fantastic with exellently voiced NPCs, music and an awesome and extensive loot/weapon collecting system. The overall gameplay and combat is great but you may find the controls being a bit flimsily formatted.Please get this game, the artstyle alone is worth it!			"

												This is not a bad game, but it isn't good enough to warrant a definition recommendation.So far I'm a couple of hours in. - Combat is floaty and underwhelming and some attacks take a lot of time to 'wind up', which is especially frustrating against fast moving enemies. This is especially annoying in my current level filled with fast moving wolves.- Navigating between weapons in a fast paced combat is difficult and fiddly, but I'm on a controller. There isn't a function to map different weapons to D-pad, so you have to navigate to a menu item whilst being attacked in real time.- Boss fights are either not challenging, or a grind fest. For example, the boss I'm on has turned me into a deer and I have to dodge her arrows. Too bad she teleports - There's no real strategy involved for this boss match at least.- While the levels are visually distinct in colour themes and have good immersive music, they offer no variation in terms of gameplay. Most places have interchangeable map design.- Because each level is its own 'zone', there's little internal variation *within* levels, it's difficult to locate oneself and explore. The fast running and scrolling means you can move fast through the level, but actually counteracts exploring.I bought this on sale, I would not recommend this game for the full price of £10.99. It's a good attempt with some nice mechanics, but falls far short of what it tries to achieve. Overall the game seems to have developed from the art style, rather than the other way around. The game itself seems like a showcase of the pretty sprites and nuggets of the Iliad dotted around. Looking at the Steam achievements one can see that barely a third of all players made it to the end of the first level, so take that as an indication that this game loses its novelty quickly.			"

Worth a buy and test.Pros:-Unique and nice art style-Simple and somewhat good gameplay.-Fitting length, the game doesn't get boring.Cons:-The combat system can be a bit wonky.

The controls are a bit unweildy at first and every time you think about them, but you can really get into them if you let yourself. I ended up loving them by the end. Boss fights are fun and varied, exploration is generally rewarded, and combat is fun! Give it a shot.			"

												One of the better indie releases this year, for sure. It's an action platformer with unique controls and combat mechanics. The controls do take a bit of time to get used to, they could be a bit more precise and responsive, but once you get the hang of it the platforming shouldn't be any problem and the combat will become really fun. Especially during boss fights, which are really well thought out. The combat basically involves swiging your weapon and blocking with your shield at the right time and switching between your melee and ranged weapons when needed. Enemies are fairly competent too, so it keeps you on your toes and encourages you to try out all the special weapons the game gives you.  It's not quite metroidvania style as in you don't really gain additional mobility from killing bosses, but the game has two main hubs connected to several other areas you can complete in more or less any order you want. Areas will offer a lot of different challenges, the game never outlasts its welcome that way. The visual style is just plain amazing and the soundtrack is also very fitting, offering brilliant orchestral arrangements.All in all an extremely good game. The only gripe I have with it is the fact that the controls aren't as finely tuned as they could be and the game, at least on my machine, suffers from performance issues on higher settings, while it really shouldn't.

												Apotheon has some fun moments, for example some of the boss fights are pretty clever. Apotheon also has some increadibly frustrating moments, for example the remaining boss fights. The visuals are nice and interesting, but that interest soon vanishes. The combat is mostly rewarding, but needlessly deep. The varieties of weapons mostly do the same thing, and they break too quickly to establish a reliable fighting style. The story is interesting, even though it isn't exactly original. I finished the game and get most of the acheivements. I don't regret playing it, however I can imagine how it could have been better.If you like Greek mythology, stabbing things, and have the time to spare, play this game. If none of those things are true, move along with no regrets.			"

												i really love this game despite it's faults in movements... great dialogue that doesn't take up too much gameplay, lovely design overall, just a really great concept... however there seems to be an issue with the way the main character moves and i'm not sure that it's present for all systems... i watched a tutorial on Hades because of difficulty I had with my character's stance and jump... this was not present in the PS4 version of the game i watched. play station players are able to take small steps whereas my play is more like a large step and bad reaction time, it might be in part to computer lag, but i'm very skeptical about that being the only reason. unfortunately, it makes crossing the river of Phlegethon akin to winning the lottery. shame really, cause this is a great game. i'll definitely play it on something else. really that is prety much the game's only fault. everything else i really love.

												OK it's fair to say I'm a big fan of Ancient Greece and Greek Mythology but even so, this is a really fun platformer action game, reminiscent of the old platformer 'Gods' although this is only focused on Greece.So far it's been very entertaining, the story is simple but compelling and thematically the game is excellent. The music, art style, characters and such is very well done. I only noticed recently that the game levels are actually painted on a rock or plaster surface. Very nice touch. You can tell this has been a labour of love and they haven't bit off more than they can chew in the art direction and design. Initially you may think the simple palette limited compared to the vibrance of contemporary games but actually it is very subtle and it doesn't take too long see why they did it. Awesome work.Gameplay is simple yet varied enough to maintain your interest through the hack'n'slash. There have been a few surprises that have me wondering what else they have up their sleeve. I'm really enjoying the variety of equipment that's all tied back to actual Greek weapons and armour with a few added mythological notes as you'd expect.All in all, a well crafted game. Enough complexity and the difficulty so far has been challenging enough without bumping it up to 'champion' level.Great stuff by the developer to put this all together. And I got it for $5. Go buy this and take a break from the AAA titles!			"

												I think I've found a new favorite sidescroller; it isn't all that often that one of those comes around where I don't roll my eyes and leave it after the first half hour. Pros:- Story. The story strays into the cliche at times, but otherwise is wonderfully crafted and engaging- Voice acting. This is something plenty games, especially sidescrollers, lack. The voice acting is spot on- Depth. The game has plenty locations to explore and plenty treasures to find, keeping the player interested and roaming- Accuracy. This is something I didn't expect, but the game tosses out old terms and quotes from the Greek poets and        Homer with astonishing regularity. This really helps the world connect back to the ancient Greek roots, unlike plenty other that wore the ""Ancient Greek"" label.- Varied Gameplay. Instead of being same-old, shoot-this kill-that, the game actively switches it up between puzzles, races, platforming challenges, and kill-them-all brawls interspersed with the occassional boss fight or conversation with an NPC. This helps it stay fresh for longer and is a welcome addition- Music. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, the music is hauntingly beautiful if somewhat repetitive after a time- Balance. This sort of game always has trouble balancing between frustratingly dificult and too easy. Apotheon manages it. There were definitely moments of sheer panic where I felt like I was being crushed, but these never crossed the line into an annoyingly hard fight.- Replayability. The first run through, without seeking out side quests or the like, on the easiest settings, takes about 12 hours. Have fun. I persume it will take another 12 on the next difficulty, and a lot more than that on Olympian.Cons:- Controls. Yes, let's talk about the one major failing that this game has; the controls. They aren't all that bad, but suffer on two points: Firstly, platforming is a bit of a nuisance. The game makes you stick to any climbable surface you touch, theoretically making platform puzzles easier but also slowing you down at inopportune moments. Furthermore, archery and thrown weapons are the slightest bit inaccurate and hard to master early on.- Tutorial. The first mission is in essence a tutorial mission. It gives you all the basics, but no more, leaving you to puzzle out the rest on your own. Where do I get more crafting recipes? Wait, my weapons can break? Can I repair them? These questions and more are left to the player to decipher. On the one hand, this can be enjoyable if the player enjoys the challenge and the thrill of discovering something new. On the other, people who want to jump straight in may suffer a few mishaps - I myself ended up fighting a boss with only one spear as my other weapons had worn down.Despite the slightly sticky controls and the imperfect tutorial, this game is still excellent. If you enjoy sidescrollers, story-driven adventure games, or Greek mythology, this game is a perfect fit and I anticipate having a lot of fun with it.			"

												A 2D platformer, which underneath it's visually stunning exterior, hides a loot + crafting and weapons/armour system. If you go in expecting a classic platforming experience, you may find yourself in unfamiliar territory, as your character and enemies are slightly larger than most other platformers. Additionally, both WASD and mouse movements are required to navigate the world and attack enemies.Once you get used to it though, you will soon be running through Ancient Greece as fast as Achilles and sticking it up those nasty incestuous gods!

												Apotheon is the most aesthetically pleasing game I have ever played. Not only does it look amazing, everything ranging from combat, crafting, and quests to the music, dialoge, and voice acting is top notch. I got a little more than 10 hours from this game and I tried to do all quests but missed some. This game is also frequently on sale and the devs added a multiplayer mode for free too. Even if you hate ""2D looking platformer games"" with a passion, Apotheon is a game you would still love as it is on a completely different level in its category. Buy it, you won't regret it :)			"

												I haven't played a lot of the game, as you may tell, however, in the short time that I did, I can tell you that the game has a great art style and is quite easy to get the hang of. Personally, I reckon its best played with a gamepad (I used an Xbox 360 controller) But a mouse and keyboard works just fine. The mechanics of the game are interesting, although not exactly groundbreaking as far as 2D platformers go.All in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a Hellenic, bloodthirst platformer to play, without wanting to put 110% effort into it.

YouTube™ Video: Apotheon - Let's Play 

			Views: 14		

			Ever wanted to be on Mount Olympus? Well, now you can, thanks to this amazing platformer!		

If you like scrolling platformer games, you'll like this one. If you actively dislike scrolling platformer games, you'll LIKE this one. It's more of an action RPG that takes its cues from side-scrolling platformers but doesn't really fit the bill. You have to actually make an effort to hit people and attack. You can block, switch weapons, craft potions and other stuff.Did I mention the graphics? Well, time to do that now: they're awesome. Besides the clear indication that this has a lot of Greek wall-art graphics to it, it is completely shaded. There are natural shadows, great animations and particle effects.There's atmospheric music and competent voice-over work.It's also pretty cheap so what are you waiting for? GET IT!			"

""Atmospheric. Captivating Greek Theme. Great Attention to Detail. Slightly Flimsy Combat. Value for Money.""Apotheon is a fun 2D platformer with a beautiful ancient greek pottery aesthetic. The story follows Nikandreos - a champion of humanity - who rises up against the Greek Gods to steal their powers and salvage the fate of his people. As Nikandreos, you will scale Mount Olympus and challenge the Gods in their respective realms.+ Apotheon's gameplay is quite solid, with plenty of interesting melee and ranged weaponry (historically-accurate ones included) to choose from, making for healthy variation in playing style.+ Great attention to detail is also displayed in level and character design, with each in-game location having a different feel and plenty of variation in the appearances of both NPCs and enemies.+ The music accompanies the game well and gives it great atmosphere, particularly during epic god fights. The lyre pieces, in particular, gives the game an elegant touch.+ The storyline is average with a cliché god-usurper plot. Nevertheless, it is well-executed.+ Game length is pretty substantial, well worth its price tag.+ A healthy level of appearance customization is available for the hero, from leather caps to wolf pelts to the iconic corinthian helmet.However,- Combat is slightly flimsy as attacks are completely mouse-dependent and can be annoyingly difficult to control when Nikandreos is surrounded by enemies, which happens fairly often.- The variety of actions available during melee combat is lacking, being limited to the usual stab or an upwards/overhead swing.- On a personal note, the amount of armor sets available for Nikandreos pales in comparison to the wide variety possessed by the NPCs, leaving something to be desired for a game so heavily focused on attaining excellent visuals.Overall, Apotheon is a good game with a composition of 55% style 45% gameplay. Its form similar to the pottery art it emulates: carefully crafted and artistically flavorful. A definite must-try if you dig its aesthetic and love classical history; a worth-trying if you're looking to play a fresh platformer.B+			"

												Who doesn't love the weird (and most often times twisted) tales of Greek mythology. Now come to life! You play as Nik, the hopeful defender of mankind, as the gods go crazy and don't want humans around anymore. The game play is pretty straight forward and creating/sorting through items is (thankfully) easy. Boss battles are challenging. Loved taking the gods legendary items by force!! Rarge! Overall an amazing 2D game that combines all that we love about mythology.     9/10Ps,Hera can suck it! Same with Apollo.			"

												If I had to describe Apotheon in one word, it'd be fun.  Plain and simple, good ol' fashioned fun.Don't come into this game looking for an immersive novel-like story---it's just not there.  But like a beautifully illustrated children's book, Apotheon shines in its simplicity, style, and sense of adventure.  It's fun to play, and fun to watch.  The controls are simple and fluid.  The scenes are beautifully rendered in the style of Greek art.  It's truly a joy to behold.The soundtrack doesn't disappointment either, with a host of tunes that totally immerse the player into the environment, and convey the excitement (and sometimes anxiety), as you pit your mortal self against the mighty gods of Olympus.It's a must for any fans of Greek mythology, or anyone who enjoyed the Iliad or Odyssey.  Fans of simple, but fun adventure games will also find a lot to like here, as well as anyone who can appreciate games as art.To be fair, the story narrative could have been better integrated into the entirety of the game.  At times, it comes off feeling slightly arbitrary, or disjointed.  The side-plots also feel a bit confusing, and it's not clear most of the time how they fit in.  But, on the whole, the story is cogent, and it works for what the game is.  Again, in keeping with my earlier metaphor, think Chris Van Allsburg, not Leo Tolstoy.  My final grade for this beautifully rendered Greek odyssey:  B+.			"

Yes, the fighting combat is a little clunky but you get thousands (not actually) different types of weapons to harness your ability to fight your enemies...The shield mechanic is KEY and feels so nice to block incoming attacks with. The story is simple yet intriguing as you ascend higher into Mount Olympus, opening up more levels to go to, mostly in any order you want, making your way to Zeus.10/10 for not letting me down with the ending.

												On surface level this is one amazing looking game. Aestethics are insipired by ancient greek vases and that style is present throughout the game (suprisingly, even in end credits).The game can be challenging, button-mashing won't get you really far but once you get a set of weapons you are comfortable with and learn their rhytm you can easily slay even the most difficult enemies.What I especially liked is how varied the levels in this platformer are. Not only aesthetically but also in style of the enemies. And boss battles are really amazing, challenging and unique.I really had a blast with this game and you should deffinetly give it a shot.			"

												As a classicist I may be a little biased, but I really enjoyed this game. The black-figure art style is what initially attracted me and made Apotheon an instant buy. Both the art and the music are beautiful, and the inclusion of quotations from the Homeric hymns and other source materials was a nice touch, and much appreciated.About the only (relatively minor) negative thing I could say about the game is that I felt that despite the huge variety in weapons and items, it didn't really seem to matter much what I used. I just picked something and only really switched when it broke or if it just wasn't getting the job done. Usually this just meant a switch from melee to ranged on a few bosses that seemed to call for it, and the occasional enemy like peltasts or mechanical sentries that were difficult to get in melee range of, rather than any specific weapon choice within those classifications. Given the realtive speed with which equipment breaks though, I did get a chance to use pretty much everything the game had to offer, however. Despite my slight ambivalence toward the combat in general, the variety in boss fights and trials, from brawling with Ares  and hunting Artemis, to traversing Athena's shifting labyrinth, to the time trials such as Dionysus' drinking contest and crossing the river Phlegethon in Hades, kept things fresh and entertaining. The encounters and puzzles were well done and provided an adequate level of challenge, but nothing proved particularly difficult. So, I might have liked to have the option to play on Olympian difficulty from the beginning, rather than have to unlock it by beating the game. There is a decent amount of content in the way of optional/side-quests to satisfy the completionist as well.All in all, Apotheon was a very enjoyable experience and highly recommended! Well done to Alientrap for this gem.			"

												Apotheon is a game about defying the Greek gods. They have abandoned mankind, so you must seek their assistance or kill them and gain their powers to save man yourself. The combat in the game is straighforward, as to be expected in a 2D action game; click to attack with melee weapons, which is done with a thrust or swing, and movement is done with the WASD keys. Ranged weapons can be thrown or launched with a bow, sling, or other devices. You can even pick up and throw boulders or stone blocks for massive damage. The difficulty on the default difficulty setting is ridiculously easy, and the next setting really isn't much harder. I think I only died a couple of times. Beating the game unlocks the hardest difficulty, which I have yet to attempt. It's a lot more fun than this simple explanation can make it sound, so I reccomend looking up a youtube video of gameplay if you don't get the picture yet. Also, there is a lot of exploration. There are a lot of goodies to be found if you just look in the right places. There is also not much backtracking, so you don't need to worry if you don't like that sort of thing.As for the presentation of the game, the art style is done in a Greek pottery fashion. There's a filter that applies to the whole screen, the colors are those that would be used in ancient greek pottery, and the screen will crack if you take too much damage. It is very nice to look at. The music, however, is lackluster. Sometimes it is not even present, and when it is, it does not stand out at all.So, overall, is the game good? Yes, it's very good. The combat is fun and you will have to plan out strategies for dealing with enemies on the fly. Environments are big and there are many secrets to discover. Honestly, the only nitpick I have is the music. Other than that, though, the game is stellar. Originally I thought I would not like this game, but when I bought it, I was very impressed. A playthrough lasted me 12 hours, and it was fun the whole way through. If you like 2D action games with some exploration in them, it's hard not to reccomend this.			"

Weapons have durability which makes the game force you to scavange for weapons.

												The controls on the PC are very frustrating and clunky, while the game demands a great deal of agility and precision in places.  It could be better on a console I suppose, or if you have something better than a basic computer keyboard. Struggling with the controls results in a great deal of repiition which makes me put the game down quickly. I can't stand repeating things over and over because my guy refuses to climb a ladder at a crucial time or if a key press doesn't register.That said, as the game continues and the player gets more armor and health, things become a bit more forgiving and you can get by with button mashing. The artwork and music are beautiful and the story is fun. It's a good value.			"

This game both reminds me of it and absolutely blows it out of the water with concept, theme, music and visual elements to make any Elgin marble in the British museum drool.  I love history, and I also love Greek myths so this fits into my cache of personal time elegantly.  I think the look of this game is fantastic, the character adaptions are perfect, and the fact that all of the elements of the story are right off the side of an ancient amphora make me want to keep it kind of forever.  I see so many negative comments about game play, the only thing negative that I've found about it is that I am a terrible driver for my little hoplite.  This game is for the player like me who loves style, substance and intelligence in a game.  Also, using Homeric poems...a touch of absolute brilliance.			"

Apotheon is a good game; not great, just good.Aesthetically, it's a gem. Both art and music are excellent and provide a consistent experience.Mechanically, the game is so-so. Combat and platforming feel uncomfortable; they aren't game-breaking but it certainly can be annoying (one of my complains of Capsized, another game by the same developers). Combats can be a little unforgiving, but have occasional great moments (I felt like being in 300). I just hope the developers perfect the feeling of the controls for further games, they don't feel quite right.Level and boss design are just fantastic and work very well with each god's characteristics. No two boss fight feel like the same. They are innovative and fun.The game also provides a very simple crafting system that I rarely had to use (except for the two default recipes: a health and shield regenerators); in fact, I became aware other recipes existed at 80% of my playthrough.Also, Apotheon tries very little to remind the player of the different side missions.TL;DRSeveral design flaws push Apotheon away from being an astonishing game. Nevertheless, it's a worthy experience worth playing.7 / 10			"

												+Astonishing design+Atmosphere+Combat and weapon system (finally something different!)+Sound(-track)+Content to explore even after the story is over-Pretty short story (I'm now done after ~9h and I can tell you I didn't rush or hurry..)-Multiple crashes and glitches (getting stuck in a wall so you have to restart the game, not too bad but a bit annoying, on Mac at least)-Movement, especially jumping and rolling, was a bit too bulky for my taste. There are parts in the game [SPOILER WARNING] in Athenas temple where you have to jump and dodge etc. and with the current movement set these were more annoying than enjoyable.Overall a cool looking nice game, would totally buy again. I did very much enjoy the experience and the game is certainly as mentioned before not over just because the story is.You should totally get this one if you're into mythology and nice game design. 8/10			"

												The concept of a greek mythology-inspired game may sound run-of-the-mill, but Apotheon is anything but. The game is a metroidvania type of action-platformer, but uses very little rpg elements, which simplifies the mechanics for players new to the genre.Your character does not level up, rather he gains extra health/protection and powers by upgrading his armor and weapons, and even honing his skill with select weapons such as the xiphos (sword) or spear.You move with the standard WASD, but use the mouse to aim, attack and block; this can be confusing for players who haven't experienced this type of controls, and this ends up muddling the combat. Often, the player will be stabbing blindly at the air, simply because the cursor isn't at the proper elevation. Likewise, this can affect the player's speed when moving if the cursor isn't in the direction the player is headed.The combat is not turn based, and most enemies can be dealt with only a few strikes of a sword or spear. However, enemies can pile up quickly and this is bothersome as running away is seldom a viable option considering the difficulties linked to platforming. The player is armed with only a modest jump and a stunted ledge grab to go through the levels.The visual style is deceptively modest, taking on the the style of ancient greek pottery of colour-on-black. The characters move mostly fluidly, bar some repeated motions during dialogues, and the background is almsot always filled with  ancient greek forests, cities and the like.Overall, Apotheon is a game that will frustrate the player in order to push them to do their best. The sometimes frustrating combat mechanics or platforming physics are easily overshadowed by the amazing visuals, immersive story and engaging gameplay.			"

												Apotheon is a fun (at first) platformer game with beautiful, artful graphics, a good soundtrack, and historically accurate weapon names.  It can be challenging at times, and a very frustrating, but I thought it was worth the sale price.  However, it gets repetitive real quick.  I haven't beaten it yet, and I got bored. I will revisit it eventually, but be prepared to burn out.EDIT: I picked up where I left off and loved it again.			"

												To anyone who is a fan of Metroidvania style games, you should seriously consider this game. The art style is beautiful and the attention to detail really surprised me as it looks rather basic at first glance. It's also very true to the art style it was trying to replicate (Ancient Greek). Combat is very fun. It's not real in depth, but it's not simple either. Story doesn't have much to it, Zeus turns his back on the people and you, a mortal, travel to Olympus to fight the gods, but it doesn't feel lacking in any way, not to mention the voice acting is very well done.

												Lovely art direction, that's the first thing you notice about Apotheon. Then you notice the slightly janky combat system, although this improves with practice (and when you get more powerful weapons). The level design is imaginative, although the fundamentals of buildings and furniture don't change that much. Good boss fights (except for the running-deer one which highlights the difficulty of moving downwards). And good ending. Overall, good-to-very-good, and worth a shot.			"

												      An awsome experience with great combat, bosses and an breathtaking level design with plenty to explore in each level, making it great for completionists speedrunners and the average player alike. The story on top of that is awsome and makes you genuinley feel like you're a character in a greek myth with an ending that left me speechless(not spoiling it).    Overall it's a great experience which is defintley worth the $15, Don't make the same mistake I made with taking the long wait for it to be on sale, IT IS A MUST BUY!5/5 A great experience that we're lucky is at this low of a price for this good of an experience.

												The artistic value and effort that has been put into this game is insane. Even the tiniest details seem to have been inspired by the ancient greek mythology and pottery artwork.The characters and storylines seem to follow the original stories and boss fights are inspired by the actual stories and characters.I have no idea how they managed to get things so accurate.The music is also great with soothing and epic moments as well.Gameplay is half times awesome and half times awful but all in all acceptable due to the good parts leaving a good feel and the difficulty being in a balanced level. Aiming projectiles with a steam controller is a bit painful (it feels a lot like playing QWOP) but luckily that is never a big issue in game (you are never in a hurry while required to target something).

												TL;DR (lengthy full review here: http://dagondogs.com/2016/10/26/apotheon-initial-impressions-review/)I actually think Apotheon is not a bad game. It's well-made and has some distinct positives to the overall package. I just happen to disagree with a lot of the design choices the developers made in regards to the combat, platforming, level-design, and story. I really want to like Apotheon because there's a lot here, but my personal preferences prevent me from doing so. I'd still recommend it, overall. Just know, you're getting a grindy MetroidVania with some deliberately peculiar combat mechanics, a stiff economy and character progression system, amidst an overly epic story about Greek mythology. It looks damn good though.			"

												The outstanding art and theme really outshine most of the problems with this fun and immersive game about man and god duking it out in ancient Greece. This is a game in the style of Metroid where dungeons/levels can be tackled in any order.The game aims to resemble a rotating vase of Greek origin and succeeds magnificiently.  It looks like you are playing a game on a piece of ancient greek pottery.  The unique art style and story wasn't thrown together in a couple hours; the developers really did their research when it came to Greek mythology and captured all the flaws and craziness of Greek dieties.  There are flavor text signposts all around the world and great voice acting.  The final climb up to Zeus is awesome and has memorable voice acting.  Levels and boss battles are unique; my favorite was the fight against Artemis when you alternate between deer and hunter.Unforunately there are a couple flaws which may turn off some people.  The game is physics based so fighting and jumping is ""floaty"". Control is not precise like a Metroid game.  Also, the inventory management is a mess and there are way too many weapons and items.  I understand the developers wanted to give the players choices but there are too many weapons to cycle through during combat and selecting items is a similar pain.  There should have been fewer weapons and items or you should have been able to set certain items to quick keys/buttons.  I recommend a controller for maximum enjoyment but still expect to be frustrated by the inventory system.I understand the game will not be for everyone but give it a chance (at least until a boss fight) as I think the developers did a great job capturing the world of ancient Greek gods in video game form.

												Apotheon is a game about defying the Greek gods. They have abandoned mankind, so you must seek their assistance or kill them and gain their powers to save man yourself. The combat in the game is straighforward, as to be expected in a 2D action game; click to attack with melee weapons, which is done with a thrust or swing, and movement is done with the WASD keys. Ranged weapons can be thrown or launched with a bow, sling, or other devices. You can even pick up and throw boulders or stone blocks for massive damage. The difficulty on the default difficulty setting is ridiculously easy, and the next setting really isn't much harder. I think I only died a couple of times. Beating the game unlocks the hardest difficulty, which I have yet to attempt. It's a lot more fun than this simple explanation can make it sound, so I reccomend looking up a youtube video of gameplay if you don't get the picture yet. Also, there is a lot of exploration. There are a lot of goodies to be found if you just look in the right places. There is also not much backtracking, so you don't need to worry if you don't like that sort of thing.As for the presentation of the game, the art style is done in a Greek pottery fashion. There's a filter that applies to the whole screen, the colors are those that would be used in ancient greek pottery, and the screen will crack if you take too much damage. It is very nice to look at. The music, however, is lackluster. Sometimes it is not even present, and when it is, it does not stand out at all.So, overall, is the game good? Yes, it's very good. The combat is fun and you will have to plan out strategies for dealing with enemies on the fly. Environments are big and there are many secrets to discover. Honestly, the only nitpick I have is the music. Other than that, though, the game is stellar. Originally I thought I would not like this game, but when I bought it, I was very impressed. A playthrough lasted me 12 hours, and it was fun the whole way through. If you like 2D action games with some exploration in them, it's hard not to reccomend this.			"

												This is an excellent game.  I'd like to first point out the art style for this game.  I love it.  It reminds me of ancient Greek pottery, which really pulls you in and makes you feel like you're playing a Greek saga.  I'm a little biased since I really like ancient antiquity.The gameplay itself is tight but it may take some getting used to at first.  You'll use an array of weapons that ARE different in their uses.  There is a progession trainer in the market in the game that allows you to level up skill profficencies with certain weapons, and I have found great success in leveling them all as opposed to being a jack of all trades.  You owe it to yourself to play this game.  It's big, two game difficulities, and interesting boss battles and enemies types that'll provide challenges in multiple playthroughs.			"

												I started out playing the game ""Battle of Olympus"" on Nintendo.  This game both reminds me of it and absolutely blows it out of the water with concept, theme, music and visual elements to make any Elgin marble in the British museum drool.  I love history, and I also love Greek myths so this fits into my cache of personal time elegantly.  I think the look of this game is fantastic, the character adaptions are perfect, and the fact that all of the elements of the story are right off the side of an ancient amphora make me want to keep it kind of forever.  I see so many negative comments about game play, the only thing negative that I've found about it is that I am a terrible driver for my little hoplite.  This game is for the player like me who loves style, substance and intelligence in a game.  Also, using Homeric poems...a touch of absolute brilliance.			"

												After I'd originally purchased the game, I sat down for a few hours with it and didn't really enjoy it. I don't know if I was accustomed to smoother play mechanics or what, but I didn't touch it for nearly a year. Then, I saw it sitting there in my inventory of games, and thought, what the hell, why not? I'm glad I gave it another shot. If you take some time and patience, the game becomes quite fluid, and the graphics and art style are worth the price of admission. Bottom line: For ~17 hours of gameplay and captivating story (true to Greek mythos), yes, pick it up!			"

In this game, playing as an ancient Greek warrior, you are going to fight against Zeus who has turned his back on human. Here are some good points of this game:    1.Open world. You can explore nearly all the places in the game and kill nearly all the NPCs you meet;    2.Wonderful graphics. Just like ancient Greek wall paintings;    3.Various weapons.

TL;DR (Complete comment below)PROS+ Beautiful and neat art style (graphics, soundtrack, atmosphere...)+ Great gameplay, controls easy to take in hand+ Great variety in weapons+ Balanced and progressive difficulty+ The PRICE for such a quality gameCONS- Some rare physics glitches (items or arrows stuck in mid-air)- Bosses fight could have had more ""strategical"" aspects- Lacks customization / stats complexity? (Well, that's no RPG, but I would have appreciated some optimization options)- Disappointing ""hardest"" difficulty level, which is quite the same as the ""hard"" difficultyFINALLY...8/10, must have indie game for anyone liking 2D action platformer gameApotheon reminds me that videogames can be WORKS OF ART on their own, not only for the graphics, the soundtrack, the animations, but by combining all of these to make an amazing and pleasant experience.COMPLETE COMMENTThis game seduced me with its art style (it's not just beautiful, but also neat and refined) and convinced me with its gameplay, which requires well-timed attacks and dodges, using the right weapon / potion at the right time, diving in the melee like a true warrior, and even sometimes avoiding useless fights.After the first mission which could be considered as a tutorial, you'll be able to chose between two difficulty levels:- The Warrior (easy) one should be adapted for casual gamers and people who want to explore the levels without being threatened much by the enemies- The Champion (hard) difficulty provides a decent challenge and requires to understand well the fighting mechanics and the different enemies- The Olympian difficulty, unlocked when finishing the game once, quite disappointing: it's the same as the Champion one, but without life autoregen when it drops below 50. Don't see the point... Maybe limitting the number of possible saves or save frequency, or giving the enemies more damages / HP would have been great to make this difficulty level worth it.To beat the game, you will be given a variety of weapons with different attack power and range (and sometimes additional effects), but that will break easily, requiring to have a good set of weapons in your inventory before diving in fights. You'll also have armours giving you damage mitigation, and various potions that will become handy (not to say vital) in many situations.The quite rare physics glitches I encountered weren't quite a problem (it's just strange to see an arrow floating in mid-air, as the rest of the game seems just perfect).For ""serial achievers"", you'll need to explore every bit of every map to find the hidden keys, chests and rare weapons, which shouldn't take you too much time but still feels rewarding and pleasant.I'm definitely convinced that this game is simply better, funnier and more challenging than many 60+$ games.

												today i was really excited to play the battlefield hardline beta, so i installed it (wich took about 5 hours) and played it,it was awful it was like playing a game made by a kid walking in his dads shoes, clumsy, dumb, and copying somthing else (a mix of payday and gta 5) i was really disapointed because i want dice to be good so bad, but as long as they are under ea they will continue to push out trash.then after that massive disapointment i bought apotheon, installed it (which took about 1 minute) and then played it,this game acomplishd something that a huge game developer with hundreds of people working on it couldent it was fun,it was so fun that i was just enthralled with it, i mean this game is probably the best game ive played in years.apotheon is a side scrolling metroidvania game..... and its ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.

												I thought i would take a punt on this game a while back, so glad i did. I genuinely thought platform games like this were extinct. The last platform game i enjoyed this much was Castlevania - Symphony of the Night many moons ago on a ps1.Im not comparing the two games im just saying that the fun i got from Apotheon was right up there. The style is like greek pottery has come to life, the character moves fluidly, and theres plenty to explore and find. Apotheon has everything i want to see from this kind of game.  You will have to get good at toggling between weapons though, accidently pulling the wrong weapon can be frustrating and deadly.  If they were to make an Egyptian game like this i'd be on it in an instant.			"

												After I'd originally purchased the game, I sat down for a few hours with it and didn't really enjoy it. I don't know if I was accustomed to smoother play mechanics or what, but I didn't touch it for nearly a year. Then, I saw it sitting there in my inventory of games, and thought, what the hell, why not? I'm glad I gave it another shot. If you take some time and patience, the game becomes quite fluid, and the graphics and art style are worth the price of admission. Bottom line: For ~17 hours of gameplay and captivating story (true to Greek mythos), yes, pick it up!			"

												Apotheon is an excellent metroidvania-style game with an amazing art style and an interesting, classically reminiscent story. Its combat system brings a lot to the table. Although it initially comes off as rather clunky, there is actually quite a bit of depth and skill required to efficiently handle the combat scenarios. I fell in love with this game within the first half hour and kept coming back over the course of 2 days to complete the game and get all of the achievements. I cannot recommend this game enough.

												What a wonderful game.The story was magnificent, accurate enough to please most any mythology buff, and long enough to have resolution. The main story is excellent because you can work your way towards it quickly or thoroughly. There is plenty more to discover than what is necessary to reach the end of the game. The gameplay is interesting and takes some getting used to. It is quality sidescrolling and the level design is quite excellent. Fighting (which is the main mechanic) can be tricky and frankly a bit clumsy, but it works well enough.Now the best parts of the game are the music and art. All of the levels are done in this beautiful classical era art. It is like you are playing the whole thing on the side of a vase. The music is epic in the right places, beautiful in others.Definitely a great game, probably about an 8/10 at least.			"

												The artistic value and effort that has been put into this game is insane. Even the tiniest details seem to have been inspired by the ancient greek mythology and pottery artwork.The characters and storylines seem to follow the original stories and boss fights are inspired by the actual stories and characters.I have no idea how they managed to get things so accurate.The music is also great with soothing and epic moments as well.Gameplay is half times awesome and half times awful but all in all acceptable due to the good parts leaving a good feel and the difficulty being in a balanced level. Aiming projectiles with a steam controller is a bit painful (it feels a lot like playing QWOP) but luckily that is never a big issue in game (you are never in a hurry while required to target something).

												Everyone like the Romans, but not everyone likes the Greeks.  There are so many games out there devoted to the Roman legacy, but hardly anything commemorating the Ancient Greeks!  Which is a shame to be certain, for the Greeks are full of potential for video games of all sorts of genres.  Here we have a great telling of a hero's tale as you combat the Greek Parthenon of gods and even big daddy Zeus himself to save your town and existance.Pros: The art is amazing!  The whole game is like a Greek Attic vase, and everything is visually enchanting.  The story is interesting too as you champion your way to the top of Mount Olympus to beat the snot out of Zeus and his cronies.Cons:  Occasionally the combat could get a bit tricky control wise, but you have ample opportunites to fight your way through.  Also was not able to bang Aphrodite, so....Overall: 10/10 - When in Rome, do as the Romans do.  When in Greece, go kill the gods because reasons.			"

												TL;DR (lengthy full review here: http://dagondogs.com/2016/10/26/apotheon-initial-impressions-review/)I actually think Apotheon is not a bad game. It's well-made and has some distinct positives to the overall package. I just happen to disagree with a lot of the design choices the developers made in regards to the combat, platforming, level-design, and story. I really want to like Apotheon because there's a lot here, but my personal preferences prevent me from doing so. I'd still recommend it, overall. Just know, you're getting a grindy MetroidVania with some deliberately peculiar combat mechanics, a stiff economy and character progression system, amidst an overly epic story about Greek mythology. It looks damn good though.			"

												This game rocks my socks. There are many things you can do in this game:  you can challenge your inner Caligula as you attempt to slay Poseidon in an epic seas battle, defeat the legendary Jerma985 in a horse battle, and spelunking and deep sea diving for treasure, all in just one of nine playable areas! The art direction in this game is tremendous, and the combat, while clunky at first, is quite unique, and many of the boss battles are very unique; this game is more than a hack and slash affair almost all of the time (although the combat can get tedious at points). My personal favorite touch to the game were small shrines that had samplings of ancient Greek texts; these added a whole new level of detail and character to a game that was already quite full of both things. Buy this game, especially if you like 2D side-scrollers or the ancient world. As one famous Homer might say about this game, ""οὐδέ κεν ὧς ἔτι χεῖρας ἐμὰς λήξαιμι φόνοιο, πρὶν πᾶσαν μνηστῆρας ὑπερβασίην ἀποτεῖσαι!""			"

												The outstanding art and theme really outshine most of the problems with this fun and immersive game about man and god duking it out in ancient Greece. This is a game in the style of Metroid where dungeons/levels can be tackled in any order.The game aims to resemble a rotating vase of Greek origin and succeeds magnificiently.  It looks like you are playing a game on a piece of ancient greek pottery.  The unique art style and story wasn't thrown together in a couple hours; the developers really did their research when it came to Greek mythology and captured all the flaws and craziness of Greek dieties.  There are flavor text signposts all around the world and great voice acting.  The final climb up to Zeus is awesome and has memorable voice acting.  Levels and boss battles are unique; my favorite was the fight against Artemis when you alternate between deer and hunter.Unforunately there are a couple flaws which may turn off some people.  The game is physics based so fighting and jumping is ""floaty"". Control is not precise like a Metroid game.  Also, the inventory management is a mess and there are way too many weapons and items.  I understand the developers wanted to give the players choices but there are too many weapons to cycle through during combat and selecting items is a similar pain.  There should have been fewer weapons and items or you should have been able to set certain items to quick keys/buttons.  I recommend a controller for maximum enjoyment but still expect to be frustrated by the inventory system.I understand the game will not be for everyone but give it a chance (at least until a boss fight) as I think the developers did a great job capturing the world of ancient Greek gods in video game form.

												     I haven't finished the game yet,but I still have something to say.    This is an interesting horizontal version ""open-world"" action game. In this game, playing as an ancient Greek warrior, you are going to fight against Zeus who has turned his back on human. Here are some good points of this game:    1.Open world. You can explore nearly all the places in the game and kill nearly all the NPCs you meet;    2.Wonderful graphics. Just like ancient Greek wall paintings;    3.Various weapons. Spear, bow, Greek fire......remember: normal weapons will be broken if they are used for many times.			"

												If it was for the music alone, I would say play Apotheon. But it's not just the music, the gameplay, the lore or the voice acting. It's fun. It's nerdy. It's beautiful. The weapons are interesting and it's almost a good thing they degrade because you'd just stick with your favorite and never try somerthing new. The elixirs are less important, but perhaps i wasn't using them right. I play a pretty defensive style, so I'm not all juiced up, but rather had others do my fighting for me. The story has fun diversions from the main quest, which is great becuase the main quest isn't that long. You get to meet most of the gods, for better or worse and it's like watching the worst family dinner ever. These people are aweful. And the saddest part is that your village has a little temple to these jerks. The aiming control for the arrow/projectiles is a little....wonky. It definitely took some getting use to and there's a little dysjunct between physics and how this game thinks arrows fly. But it's not impossible and when you have awesome swords and spears, you don't need arrows but for puzzle. I am more of a slash and bash sort of player, so if you were expecting to finesse your way into Olyumpus then... this game might be frustrating.			"

												Apotheon, a game of art and challenging game levels.Apotheon is a game with basic flaws. It is a game about a man who is destined to become a God by killing the Gods that turned their back from humanity. The Gods have desecrated their promises to the humans and now they left humanity in utter chaos.The game has very basic controls that need to get used to if you're new to side scrolling games.Apotheon has one of the most beautiful graphics I have ever seen in a game. It is truly a work of art and a true masterpiece. The game's graphics has the type of art that ancient greek vases have. I like that ancient and mythical feel to the game.The game has a very nice soundtrack that sets the mood in each place that you visit.I warn players that become angry easily to hard games because this game is very challenging in some levels, but it adds to the realism and fun of it.The game is beautiful and aesthetic and because of this I give this game a 9/10. I wish it was longer and it had more awesome quests that involve more player freedom.Buy this game! It wont dissapoint! I promise!			"

												I think I've found a new favorite sidescroller; it isn't all that often that one of those comes around where I don't roll my eyes and leave it after the first half hour. Pros:- Story. The story strays into the cliche at times, but otherwise is wonderfully crafted and engaging- Voice acting. This is something plenty games, especially sidescrollers, lack. The voice acting is spot on- Depth. The game has plenty locations to explore and plenty treasures to find, keeping the player interested and roaming- Accuracy. This is something I didn't expect, but the game tosses out old terms and quotes from the Greek poets and        Homer with astonishing regularity. This really helps the world connect back to the ancient Greek roots, unlike plenty other that wore the ""Ancient Greek"" label.- Varied Gameplay. Instead of being same-old, shoot-this kill-that, the game actively switches it up between puzzles, races, platforming challenges, and kill-them-all brawls interspersed with the occassional boss fight or conversation with an NPC. This helps it stay fresh for longer and is a welcome addition- Music. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, the music is hauntingly beautiful if somewhat repetitive after a time- Balance. This sort of game always has trouble balancing between frustratingly dificult and too easy. Apotheon manages it. There were definitely moments of sheer panic where I felt like I was being crushed, but these never crossed the line into an annoyingly hard fight.- Replayability. The first run through, without seeking out side quests or the like, on the easiest settings, takes about 12 hours. Have fun. I persume it will take another 12 on the next difficulty, and a lot more than that on Olympian.Cons:- Controls. Yes, let's talk about the one major failing that this game has; the controls. They aren't all that bad, but suffer on two points: Firstly, platforming is a bit of a nuisance. The game makes you stick to any climbable surface you touch, theoretically making platform puzzles easier but also slowing you down at inopportune moments. Furthermore, archery and thrown weapons are the slightest bit inaccurate and hard to master early on.- Tutorial. The first mission is in essence a tutorial mission. It gives you all the basics, but no more, leaving you to puzzle out the rest on your own. Where do I get more crafting recipes? Wait, my weapons can break? Can I repair them? These questions and more are left to the player to decipher. On the one hand, this can be enjoyable if the player enjoys the challenge and the thrill of discovering something new. On the other, people who want to jump straight in may suffer a few mishaps - I myself ended up fighting a boss with only one spear as my other weapons had worn down.Despite the slightly sticky controls and the imperfect tutorial, this game is still excellent. If you enjoy sidescrollers, story-driven adventure games, or Greek mythology, this game is a perfect fit and I anticipate having a lot of fun with it.			"

The level design is imaginative, although the fundamentals of buildings and furniture don't change that much. Good boss fights (except for the running-deer one which highlights the difficulty of moving downwards). And good ending. Overall, good-to-very-good, and worth a shot.			"

Looks amazing, but marred with clunky combat and technical issuesMove over God of War there is another game based on Greek mythology and it is Apotheon. Sure some Greek Gods show up as personas in Persona 3 or playable gods in Smite, but there aren’t many games entirely set in Greek mythology. With all that said, it is very unfortunate that Apotheon doesn’t do anything much with its’ story. The story is similar to that of God of War without the constant talk of being angry and yearning to have revenge. Zeus being a jerk that he is abandons humanity causing chaos and grief. You play as Nikandreous, a Greek warrior that saves his town from an attack from bandits. He is then greeted by Hera and she explains that the origin of humanity’s suffering is caused by Zeus. The only way Nikandreous can save humanity is by killing gods gaining their power and eventually challenging Zeus. The visual design is Apotheon’s strongest suit and makes an immediate impact once the game is booted up for the game for the first time. The game looks as if you were playing on ancient Greek pottery. There is a loving attention to detail from how the characters move across the screen as if they were drawn on actual pottery. One striking example is how your character climbs ladders on its’ sides rather than directly in front of it. The colors match the ancient Greek pottery to a tee, with an emphasis on yellow and red hues. Unfortunately, the game rarely mixes up its’ art style. I found the yellow and red hues especially difficult to look at for gaming sessions longer than an hour. It felt like the equivalent of playing back to back Mario lava levels for one hour straight. There are some some levels that introduce blue and green hues, but they are the exception to the rule.The gameplay in Apotheon plays like a metroidvania game without the gating element. Once you have access to lockpicks and Greek fire which is gained a little past the tutorial, you’re free navigate to any area within a level. You do gain powers by defeating bosses in Apotheon, but they only serve to advance the story and improve Nikandreous’ combat effectiveness.Speaking of combat, Nikandreous can wield swords, axes, lances, bows, maces and more. Each weapon has a wind-up time as well as an attack range requiring the player to switch between weapons mid-combat depending on the situation. Attacking an enemy with a spear that’s too close and the spear won’t connect. You can throw your weapon directly at the enemy and pick it back up, offering a stylish alternative to finish off a ranged enemy without resorting to bows or javelins. There is also a stamina bar that prevents you from spamming attacks. Rounding out the list of combat options are shields, a combat roll and craftable utility items like Greek Fire, potions and armor kits.The combat sounds well designed but is easily abused. Ranged combat works as intended, but become extended affairs especially against shielded foes. There is no enemy collision so you can literally walk into the enemy and swing at him until he dies. In fact you can do this with almost any weapon even spears as long as you have Nikandreous aim directly above or below. Once I was out of stamina, I would roll out the way, let it recharge and redo this process. I was able to repeatedly do this even against late game foes.The other issue with the combat is its’ physics. There are some enemies that can throw Nikandreous. On one occasion, my character was thrown into a wall and clipped through the other side. On another occasion, my character clipped through a wall and was instakilled. There are also explosions and certain enemies that can knockback Nikandreous. The knockbacks have a tendency to bounce Nikandreous ludicrously high in the air allowing you to skip major portions of a level if timed correctly.Inventory management is unintuitive and clunky. The weapons and items are arranged vertically as small icons and becomes a mess to go through especially halfway into the game. There is no way to sell items so you’ll often find yourself rummaging through ten to twenty melee and ranged weapons. Adding insult to injury is that some weapons are completely buggy. The discus weapon for example is a boomerang-like weapon, that returns to Nikandreous after being thrown. Once the discus returns to the player, the weapon is automatically equipped. There were occasions when the discus was permanently affixed as my equipped weapon and I was unable to change weapons. In order to fix the issue, I had to throw the discus and have it get stuck in the environment. Also there is no quest log and I wasn’t even aware that there were optional quests until I checked the item section in my inventory.Technical issues also find its’ way in the audio department. The music was fine, but the sound effects and voice acting were completely silent. After some quick Google searches, I discovered that the game does not work for speakers in surround sound settings and must be set to stereo. I had my speakers set to surround sound for over a year and this is the first game where I’ve encountered such an issue.Ultimately Apotheon is a satisfactory but flawed metroidvania type game. The game is absolutely gorgeous and nails the ancient Greek pottery art look. But looks are the only thing the game does right, everything else about Apotheon is marred with clunky combat and technical issues. I can’t recommend Apotheon to anyone unless if you’re into Greek Art. If you want to play a metroidvania game that looks great and does its’ combat justice I would recommend playing Guacamelee instead.			"

												I rarely every write reviews for games, but atfer playing for only one hour I'm already totally enthralled in the story. The combat system is totally amazing, and despite everyone complaining about the controls you can rebind them.All the negative reviews were either about the combat system or controls for the most part, but I like both. The combat system is a little bit different, but in my oppinion it's really well designed. You can have an off-hand and main-hand (standard stuff, I know) but they have tons and tons of weapons that have various damages and attack speeds. You also get exhausted, so the more you attack the slower you'll attack until you take a break between attacking and re-gain attack speed (the bar goes up really fast, it's not like fight someone, wait 2 minutes, fight someone else). When blocking with a shield it shows an area that you can move around to block attacks. There's also armor that basically adds more health in the sense that all damafe done to you will be dealt to your armor. Sometimes when killing enemies they'll drop blue things that'll restore your armor a certain amount (even if armor level reaches 0, they don't break).Overall this is a great game and definitely worth 15$. Paying 4$ for this is practically cheating the developers.			"

												If you love mythology and history, then check this game out. It's a side-scroller with beautiful looking ancient Greek style art. You are a character named Nikandreos and you must travel to Olympus to defeat the gods who are fed up with humanity. Each gods arena you visit is designed differently to that specific god. Like Athena's arena of traps and puzzles or Ares's arena full of blood and crazy warriors. This game also has the right kind of attitudes the gods had. I'm a history nut so that was a major plus for me. The one thing that annoyed me was the combat system, but that made it more challenging and I was still able to beat the game.			"

												Apotheon is an imperfect delight. The major selling point to this 2D action game is its unique and gorgeous art style, at all times evoking an epic tale, painted in loving strokes on ancient masonry. It's like nothing I've seen before, and it elevates this game well above the clumsy inventory or irritating weapon degradation that could have dragged it down.The boss fights are many and varied, which means some are poorly designed♥♥♥♥♥♥ while the creative mechanics of others shine, making for tense memorable battles where one can prevail through skill and wit.While the deicidal plot is predictable (and awfully similar to God of War i'm told), all the little details add up to a very authentic feeling of whimsical brutality that characterizes greek mythology. Much like a video game's protagonist, Greek heroes would leave a path of carnage littered with slain foes and fools too weak, slow, or dull to follow the hero's path. Apotheon is full of moments that look and feel worthy of a hero's tale.			"

I got a little more than 10 hours from this game and I tried to do all quests but missed some. This game is also frequently on sale and the devs added a multiplayer mode for free too.

												Apotheon, a 2D scroller combat game features fantastic classical art, both in detailed backgrounds as well as functional objects. More impressive is its fluidity into the gameplay. Although at times the combat gets authentically chaotic, there is a fluidity in the weapons system that is something to speak off. A well excuted, roll, followed by a stab with your javelin and a fianle with a throwing the said javelin is never the question of the games mechanic but rather personal skill which is exactly how a game like this should handle.Combat and interaction with major gods is fresh for each boss fight. Good right to the very end.			"

												Very solid Metroidvania style game with an amazing art style. The combat feels good, and the different weapons all have a good feel to them. There are also tons of unique weapons and armor to be found scattered throughout the world to keep you exploring. Overall, this game is a very well done metroidvania, accompanied with some very unique graphics as well as a simple yet fun combat system.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Apotheon is the second game developed by Alien Trap Games, the same people who developed Capsized. Apotheon is a 2D side scrolling action RPG game based on Greek mythology where your home has been destroyed by the Gods of Olympus, you have to ascend Mount Olympus and defeat the GodsIt is a simple game, but has a lot of mehcanics that need to be learnt slowly. I love Apotheon's storyline as I love Greek mythology, and seeing all the Gods, such as Poseidon, Zeus, Hades and many more in Apotheon, made me really happy seeing them in a videogameThe game's mechanics teach you not to button mash when it comes to combat, you have to strategically plan your attacks, and if you don't or fail to plan them correctly, then you are liable of being killed. The combat is simple, plan your combat correctly, strike the enemy until his/her healthbar reaches to zero, but as mentioned before its not that easyOverall, the game is not easy. It has the same amount of difficulty that Capsized offered, however, there isn't a huge difficulty spike as Capsized hadThe music is wonderful and made me feel like I was on Mount Olypmus during the Greek times. The voice acting was really good, hearing every single character talk in the game was a nice additionApotheon also offers a free to play multiplayer portion which is seperate to the main game, however, for me personally, I cannot understand why Alien Trap Games made a multiplayer version so late and seperately, the multiplayer is bare bones, hardly no one plays it, whenever there is a match it always keeps on disconnecting and personally, Apotheon's multiplayer is a waste of time...Apotheon is a nice game to play in short bursts, it is not an easy game, but certainly not as unforgiving as Capsized. Apotheon Arena (which is the multiplayer portion of Apotheon) is a waste of time downloading and playing RECOMMENDED :)  "

												This game is everything I never knew I wanted. Back when it was released, I dismissed it as ""just another metroidvania game"" banking on its unique aesthetic. I bought it on a whim much later, and fell in love. This game has a stunning art style, and unique(ish) combat. Strikes have to be planned deliberately, as there is some (intentional) input lag. Boss battles are memorable and well designed (with a couple exceptions). The story is bare bones but has some great moments. Not for everyone but then nothing is. If you like Greek mythology and metroidvania games pick this one up.			"

												Just finished this game and having never written a review for a game here on Steam; I felt compelled to do so (call it, will of the gods). I thoroughly enjoyed it and hereby recommend it!  Rise, Nikandreos, protect your people and destroy the evil gods! Pros:- Matches ancient greek art perfectly (seriously, compare the game to actual black-figure pottery art)- Music - Voice acting (even if it sounds British)- Gameplay - changing and challenging, but not so difficult you pull your hair out- Extracts from written history/mythology (such as Homer's Illiad) adds great immersion into the gameCons:- A few dollars too much perhaps (I bought it on sale but would be happy to pay more than what I did, just not the normal price) - Campaign could include maybe two or three more levels to give it some more gametime, but just go for all the achievements and that'll extend (obviously)I did not experience any glitches, bugs, or problems while playing.

												An action/platformer with well thought out gameplay. Feels a bit like an action RPG in the sense that you have a degree of freedom which of your objectives to pursue and a lot of side areas to explore, there's a lot of items to find, weapons, shields, ammunition, crafting items, healing items, buff items... add to that item shops, crafting and there's a lot to do. On the other hand every item is pretty much somehow breakable or consumable meaning you always need more. The secrets themselves are fun to look for but rarely give anything you couldn't just get otherwise. There is a degree of power progression as you get more gear, buy better training and armor over time as well as get permanent buffs for completing quests although it doesn't go into metroidvania territory and upgrades aren't neccesary to open new areas.Combat itself is fun, varied and has plenty of nuance to it, several types of weapons to use with different ranges, attack types and blind spots when you attack, you can use ranged or melee weapons or even crafted explosives and occassionally items in the enviroment to your advantage.Enemies are varied although a surprising ammount of them are more annoying than dangerous, such as hit-and-run wolves, skirmishers and archers that do their damnest to keep away from you, skeletons that refuse to permanently die and so on. Even if they're not dangerous landing a hit against some of them can be a chore. Bosses themselves are pretty well done and usually just test your skills in combat, though some get tricky as well and will involve you chasing them around the arena or looking for that one item that can temporarily incapacitate them.The game features varied enviroments, level design and often has levels distinct by structure or some gimmick that makes it memorable. When you're in Athena's realm, you have to get around through a maze filled with traps, Ares throws you in a bloody pit filled with deathmatch style combat against whoever is present and Hades will see you walking around darkness and fending off the unrelenting dead and that's just a few. This is level design done right and fits in with the personalities of the deities you face against.The graphics style as you can see is very unique and I understand some people can be turned off by it, but it very much fits the story based on greek myths and makes the game way more stylish than if it just had generic 2D greek style enviroments. The only complaint I have here is the animations look not so well at times and in some cases could do with an overhaul.Overal, unless you suffer from an irrational hate to the style, definitely try it out. Great and memorable game that could show many other games how to make level design interesting and memorable.			"

Personally, I reckon its best played with a gamepad (I used an Xbox 360 controller) But a mouse and keyboard works just fine. The mechanics of the game are interesting, although not exactly groundbreaking as far as 2D platformers go.All in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a Hellenic, bloodthirst platformer to play, without wanting to put 110% effort into it.

												A 2D platformer, which underneath it's visually stunning exterior, hides a loot + crafting and weapons/armour system. If you go in expecting a classic platforming experience, you may find yourself in unfamiliar territory, as your character and enemies are slightly larger than most other platformers. Additionally, both WASD and mouse movements are required to navigate the world and attack enemies.Once you get used to it though, you will soon be running through Ancient Greece as fast as Achilles and sticking it up those nasty incestuous gods!

												The art in this game is gorgeous and the music is great. On that alone, if you're a fan of mythology, you should pick up this game. Each level and God poses a unique puzzle, for example a maze or scavenger hunt. There are also huge optional areas of each map to explore. As other reviews have stated, the controls take a bit to get use to, but I found that added to the challenge and fun of this game.			"

												Apotheon is fun. The artwork is beautiful, the gods and mythos interesting, the gameplay is fun, and there's both enough challenge and slack to appeal to higher and lower skill levels. The game is not long in terms of its main story (it took me 9 hours total), though it can be fun to explore a bit and try to get the acheivements, or just bash some enemies, so there's potential to pad the run time, or replay.The game does have its faults though. For me, the controls were spotty most of the time. Areas that required precise and agile platforming were absolutely horrible, and when combine with the pressure of combat made for an entirely unenjoyable experience. The controls also prevented me from enjoying all that Apotheon's combat had to offer, since I could never actually do anything more advanced than flail a spear at my enemies. Also, the game will hard crash at times. The crashes usually occur when loading in a new area or cutscene, and the auto-saver does a pretty good job of covering you so that it's a simple matter of rebooting and hitting continue, but it's not perfect, and you might have to completely redo a boss battle if it fails (I did).In summary, the controls are imprecise and problematic, there are issues with hard crashes, but Apotheon will deliver what it promises, namely unique and interesting mythological Greek gameplay.

												After only playing an hour of the game I can say with honesty that it is going to bring hours more of fun. Pros:-Atmosphere-Soundtrack-Animation-Unique design-Ancient Greece... who doesn't like ancient Greece?Cons:-Janky Controls every now and thenIf you're into ancient history, this game is surely worth a play, buying it in the steam sales at a £2.74 pricetag is basically nothing for a unique game.

												Apotheon, a game of art and challenging game levels.Apotheon is a game with basic flaws. It is a game about a man who is destined to become a God by killing the Gods that turned their back from humanity. The Gods have desecrated their promises to the humans and now they left humanity in utter chaos.The game has very basic controls that need to get used to if you're new to side scrolling games.Apotheon has one of the most beautiful graphics I have ever seen in a game. It is truly a work of art and a true masterpiece. The game's graphics has the type of art that ancient greek vases have. I like that ancient and mythical feel to the game.The game has a very nice soundtrack that sets the mood in each place that you visit.I warn players that become angry easily to hard games because this game is very challenging in some levels, but it adds to the realism and fun of it.The game is beautiful and aesthetic and because of this I give this game a 9/10. I wish it was longer and it had more awesome quests that involve more player freedom.Buy this game! It wont dissapoint! I promise!			"

I'm replaying it on here, still as good as it was the 1st time I played it.-Great art style-Cool story-Challenging gameplay-Great controls ( I mapped them to a gamepad to be near similar to the PS4 version)Definitley worth the moneyNote: They had local multiplayer that I was able to play with a friend online with, using the shareplay feature on ps4. We had a blast!!! Now they have online multiplayer that has more features. It's FREE (Apotheon Arena) here on steam.			"

												An excellent 2D platformer that I hope to play again on the unlocked harder difficulty.Pretty fun and solid combat system is complimented well by the ancient greek art and story styles, and while I was fairly happy with general combat with a decent variety in enemies, I think the uniqueness of different boss battles was my favourite part of the game.I'm hoping that the free multiplayer version of the game develops well as I would greatly enjoy thrashing my friends in this :)			"

												OK it's fair to say I'm a big fan of Ancient Greece and Greek Mythology but even so, this is a really fun platformer action game, reminiscent of the old platformer 'Gods' although this is only focused on Greece.So far it's been very entertaining, the story is simple but compelling and thematically the game is excellent. The music, art style, characters and such is very well done. I only noticed recently that the game levels are actually painted on a rock or plaster surface. Very nice touch. You can tell this has been a labour of love and they haven't bit off more than they can chew in the art direction and design. Initially you may think the simple palette limited compared to the vibrance of contemporary games but actually it is very subtle and it doesn't take too long see why they did it. Awesome work.Gameplay is simple yet varied enough to maintain your interest through the hack'n'slash. There have been a few surprises that have me wondering what else they have up their sleeve. I'm really enjoying the variety of equipment that's all tied back to actual Greek weapons and armour with a few added mythological notes as you'd expect.All in all, a well crafted game. Enough complexity and the difficulty so far has been challenging enough without bumping it up to 'champion' level.Great stuff by the developer to put this all together. And I got it for $5. Go buy this and take a break from the AAA titles!			"

												I think I've found a new favorite sidescroller; it isn't all that often that one of those comes around where I don't roll my eyes and leave it after the first half hour. Pros:- Story. The story strays into the cliche at times, but otherwise is wonderfully crafted and engaging- Voice acting. This is something plenty games, especially sidescrollers, lack. The voice acting is spot on- Depth. The game has plenty locations to explore and plenty treasures to find, keeping the player interested and roaming- Accuracy. This is something I didn't expect, but the game tosses out old terms and quotes from the Greek poets and        Homer with astonishing regularity. This really helps the world connect back to the ancient Greek roots, unlike plenty other that wore the ""Ancient Greek"" label.- Varied Gameplay. Instead of being same-old, shoot-this kill-that, the game actively switches it up between puzzles, races, platforming challenges, and kill-them-all brawls interspersed with the occassional boss fight or conversation with an NPC. This helps it stay fresh for longer and is a welcome addition- Music. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, the music is hauntingly beautiful if somewhat repetitive after a time- Balance. This sort of game always has trouble balancing between frustratingly dificult and too easy. Apotheon manages it. There were definitely moments of sheer panic where I felt like I was being crushed, but these never crossed the line into an annoyingly hard fight.- Replayability. The first run through, without seeking out side quests or the like, on the easiest settings, takes about 12 hours. Have fun. I persume it will take another 12 on the next difficulty, and a lot more than that on Olympian.Cons:- Controls. Yes, let's talk about the one major failing that this game has; the controls. They aren't all that bad, but suffer on two points: Firstly, platforming is a bit of a nuisance. The game makes you stick to any climbable surface you touch, theoretically making platform puzzles easier but also slowing you down at inopportune moments. Furthermore, archery and thrown weapons are the slightest bit inaccurate and hard to master early on.- Tutorial. The first mission is in essence a tutorial mission. It gives you all the basics, but no more, leaving you to puzzle out the rest on your own. Where do I get more crafting recipes? Wait, my weapons can break? Can I repair them? These questions and more are left to the player to decipher. On the one hand, this can be enjoyable if the player enjoys the challenge and the thrill of discovering something new. On the other, people who want to jump straight in may suffer a few mishaps - I myself ended up fighting a boss with only one spear as my other weapons had worn down.Despite the slightly sticky controls and the imperfect tutorial, this game is still excellent. If you enjoy sidescrollers, story-driven adventure games, or Greek mythology, this game is a perfect fit and I anticipate having a lot of fun with it.			"

												Absolutely excellent game of extremely high production values for a small studio, amazing voice acting, and truly solid and fun, diverse combat and platforming. Each boss battle had some really interesting or intuitive gimmick that added a ton of fun and really mixed up combat and gameplay as a whole, and the art style was wholly fantastic.Not even going to get into the mythology nerd crap real deep, but they really hit the nail on the head - their consultant was excellent and did amazing work. The artistically accurate depictions of satyrs with their weird boners and getting a rated T rating really amazed me, too; I don't even know how that happened, considering how awful esrb usually is to smaller studios and indie games.I bought this game on a whim looking for more sweet platformers like Environmental Station Alpha and Axiom Verge.I was enthralled when I started it and got into it and spent two days pounding through a 16 hour long epic.The combat seems rough around the edges at first - go slow, pay attention, and shield. Controller or mouse tilt will alter if your attacks are swipes or stabs, and it's a big deal. It becomes a HUGE deal in the end, so pay attention - the combat becomes second nature if you truly try to grasp it.I had some criticisms at first but they melted away after about an hour - this game was truly a masterpiece that improved the entire way through.

												I had decided to take a break from my usual gaming direction revolving around waifu bait and Japanime, and turned my attention towards my second favorite culture, Greek Mythology.  In addition to offering surprisingly fun platforming gameplay, Apotheon does a great job of capturing the essence of the Olympian gods and their attitudes.  Especially Hera.  Zeus must have slept with a really hot mortal girl to get Hera that riled up.  The only gripe I would have is the Nephilim tier main character, Nikandreos.  Who evidently is a mortal capable of running around Olympus and slaying everything, including the gods.  They were called immortals for a reason, you know.  But I guess staying 100% true to the lore and having Zeus send him straight to Hades in the first five minutes would have made for a lousy game, so I'll give them a pass on that.  All and all, it was a wildly enjoyable game that any fan of Greek myth should like.  It even has a Dionysus drinking game!10/10...I'll never forget you, Athena. Not ever.			"

												UPDATED. Just finished the game, and my opinion is unchanged from my initial impressions. I adore this game and enjoyed very nearly every minute of it. Combat is a little awkward; there are a few glitchy things, and I crashed a few times... but it's all forgivable, because this game feels like it was made just for me.This is the only game I can recall where the mythology was truly given a proper treatment. It's woven into the entire game and presented with care and affection. I've been fascinated with Greek mythology since I was a child, and am not used to seeing it presented with such fidelity in any entertainment medium. I enjoyed Disney's animated Hercules film, and the first two God of War games on Playstation, but in either one of those cases the mythology could have been swapped with entirely original characters and no one would have known the difference. Here, the mythology IS the story, and it's done very well. And I am in love with the visuals: the varied color palettes, the silhouetted Greek pottery art style complete with texture and lighting overlay and simulated imperfections. I could stare at it forever; it's gorgeous... and the music is wonderful, too.Yet it's so difficult to unconditionally recommend the game, and the combat and controls are the reason. Using mouse and keyboard, the game controls like Terraria: Move with WASD, jump with spacebar, and control your weapons with the mouse, pointing the cursor around the screen to determine the direction you will strike. You will either be okay with these controls, or you will hate them. Personally, I thought they worked pretty well most of the time. I didn't love the apparent inability to choose how I was going to swing my weapon, but I didn't find it much of an issue on the normal difficulty, which is a little on the easy side. Now if I spent a few hours on Olympian difficulty, I might feel much differently. I haven't decided whether I'm going to attempt that yet.Overall, though, I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Loved it, loved it.			"

												If you like Castlevania or Metroid then this will be right up you ally. The game map reminds me of Metroid II: Return of Samus; an overall linear progression from start to finish, but with several deviation areas that you'll need to enter in order to obtain the upgrades. Not all the upgrades are actually necessary to beat the game, but once you move up to either the 'Champion' or 'Olympian' Difficulty Settings, the extra bonuses are certainly worth going out of your way for. Finally, most sections contain at least one secret area which require hidden keys to reach.You collect 'ingrediants' by killing enemies and then use the pause menu to craft them into useable items like potions, traps, and even summon-able allies. Collect the gold they drop to spend on new crafting recipes, more weapons, better armor, and improved combat training. There are a lot of different weapons to be obtained (both primary and secondary), and selecting the right one for any given circumstance can sometimes be the difference between life and death.The best aspect of this game is in how well laid-out the 'boss fights' are. The scenarios are generally challenging, but not aggraviatingly so. Each fight is comeplely unique, using setting appropriate material; such as the fight against Pseidon from the deck of your ship; the seas roiling around you while he pummels your tiny vessel. Not to mention the musical scores that accompany each of the fights lends a desperation to the tone of the game not usually seen in side-scrollers.Do I recommend this game? Yes, it took me almost 18 hours to beat it just on the first Difficulty Setting and I will definately play it through again. Not to mention, once you feel that you're pretty good at the main game, there's Apotheon Arena; the standalone multiplayer portion (which is completely FREE) if you'd like to test you mettle against the best that virtual Greece has to offer!

The soundtrack is great, the art style is perfect for the subject.The puzzles were entertaining and not that difficult, there are various ways you can build your character.The controls, especially the combat, can be a little problematic, but nothing you can't get used to. I found ranged combat a bit difficult, but I always prefer melee anyway, so it may be just me.Overall, I'd recommend this game for people who are into Mythology and enjoys Platformer Adventures. "

												I found it hard to return to platform games but this one certainly ticks all the boxes for me when I gave it a chance.  Sometimes I did find that switching from melee to tools to range to melee can be cumbersome especially when you're continually being interrupted or in the heat of combat. Would be nice to be able to bind some buttons to certain items or the active item for each category (maybe there is and I haven't looked hard enough). But I've been thoroughly enjoying the smooth yet simple graphics, voice dialogue and story.			"

Some people have been complaining about controls but I found them fine on keyboard and mouse,better than quite a few big budget games I've played. Anyway,get this game if you like Greek stuff. If you don't, get it anywhere because it's really fun.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game. While I don't find that it will have very much replayablity, it is still a fantastic game. I recommend this to people who enjoy greek mythology, it's very lore rich game and handles very smoothly. I feels awesome  to gain more power and topple more powerful gods as you assend mount olympus.			"

												This is an amazing game, again, and again I've come back to it, and I've come up with a conclusion, which is that i want more. That is the only porblem I've really had with this game, it simply is not long enough, not to say that the time it gives you is not worth the money, because it is. Simply saying, a basic online multiplayer mode would not only be doable, but enjoyable as well, extending the play time and making this a greater game. If this isn't what the developers wanted, then so be it, it is still a great game and brings much amuzement and fun to any who play. 8/10: Love it, just need more!!			"

												One of the best Metroidvania games to date.  Incredible art direction. Incredibly tight controls on a gamepad or controller.All around fantastic game that could easily be priced at $40Recomendations:  Do not even touch this game without a gamepad or controller.  Keyboard and Mouse don't do this game justice.			"

												Apotheon is a very nice and enjoyable game.The greek pottery style graphics and atmosphere are brilliant.Gameplay mechanics together with a great variety of items add a more tactical feeling to the gamemaking you wanna try different strategies every time you pick something new from a jar or a chest.Finally music and sounds are great, making  the game much more atmospheric.I truly recommend Apotheon to all of you.

												Just finished this game and having never written a review for a game here on Steam; I felt compelled to do so (call it, will of the gods). I thoroughly enjoyed it and hereby recommend it!  Rise, Nikandreos, protect your people and destroy the evil gods! Pros:- Matches ancient greek art perfectly (seriously, compare the game to actual black-figure pottery art)- Music - Voice acting (even if it sounds British)- Gameplay - changing and challenging, but not so difficult you pull your hair out- Extracts from written history/mythology (such as Homer's Illiad) adds great immersion into the gameCons:- A few dollars too much perhaps (I bought it on sale but would be happy to pay more than what I did, just not the normal price) - Campaign could include maybe two or three more levels to give it some more gametime, but just go for all the achievements and that'll extend (obviously)I did not experience any glitches, bugs, or problems while playing. Ran perfectly at maximum settings.			"

												This is an outstanding game, i'm quite impressed and would like to thank developer team for their work.Pros: Fluent controls(i play with xbox controller)Beautiful art and graphicsGood plot(i was quite touched in the end)Satisfying combat system with lots of disposable weaponry, there are bows, spears, swords, etc, all authentic ancient greek like sarissa, kopis, leaf-shaped xiphos etc. Exploration is fun and is rewarded Huge game deph: you can craft traps, potions, magic items that will summon allies, and a lot more.Made with love to Greek mythology, there are a lot of quotes from ancient sourses, nothing in game feels off.Level design and boss battles are outstanding, unique and epic. Fighting Poseidon and labirynth of Athena are my favourites.Music is very atmospheric and melodic, i loved the harp main theme, the vocal parts in Agora and clay drums in Poseidon's level. Also you can play local arena versus friend!I found no cons, mb only that the game is poorly advertised. "

												I've always loved ancient mythology and history, and as soon as i saw apotheon i had to buy it. I love the pottery like art style, its such a clever way to really capture the ancient mood. The combat system is also another pro of this game, it runs so smoothly, and i love the concept of being able to throw every weapon you can equip. I actually really enjoyed reading about the different gods and godesses and how they contributed to the lifesytle of humans. I can only say positive things about this game so i have to recommend this game to anyone who likes good combat, a great plotline and a fabulous art style. 10/10			"

												Cool, unique little game. I would call this more of a Metroidvania-like then an RPG. There are different ""bosses"" to complete throughout the game, but some are optional. Doing those optional bosses will unlock better gear to make progress easier. There is alot of combat in this game, which I enjoyed, however, at times the combat is frustrating. The animations are somewhat clunky, which makes striking your enemies difficult sometimes. Still, the game as a whole overcomes the somewhat bad combat. The main game ran me about 8 hours, and I only did some of the optional ""bosses"". There are also a number of hidden chests and achievements to explore for. Overall, recommended.			"

												A 2D platformer, which underneath it's visually stunning exterior, hides a loot + crafting and weapons/armour system. If you go in expecting a classic platforming experience, you may find yourself in unfamiliar territory, as your character and enemies are slightly larger than most other platformers. Additionally, both WASD and mouse movements are required to navigate the world and attack enemies.Once you get used to it though, you will soon be running through Ancient Greece as fast as Achilles and sticking it up those nasty incestuous gods!

												Apotheon is fun. The artwork is beautiful, the gods and mythos interesting, the gameplay is fun, and there's both enough challenge and slack to appeal to higher and lower skill levels. The game is not long in terms of its main story (it took me 9 hours total), though it can be fun to explore a bit and try to get the acheivements, or just bash some enemies, so there's potential to pad the run time, or replay.The game does have its faults though. For me, the controls were spotty most of the time. Areas that required precise and agile platforming were absolutely horrible, and when combine with the pressure of combat made for an entirely unenjoyable experience. The controls also prevented me from enjoying all that Apotheon's combat had to offer, since I could never actually do anything more advanced than flail a spear at my enemies. Also, the game will hard crash at times. The crashes usually occur when loading in a new area or cutscene, and the auto-saver does a pretty good job of covering you so that it's a simple matter of rebooting and hitting continue, but it's not perfect, and you might have to completely redo a boss battle if it fails (I did).In summary, the controls are imprecise and problematic, there are issues with hard crashes, but Apotheon will deliver what it promises, namely unique and interesting mythological Greek gameplay.

												Stunning artwork and a beautiful score to accompany. I was thoroughly addicted after the first ten minutes of gameplay. I bought it on sale but I would buy it again at full price if only to encourage the creators in their further endeavors. Battling Apollo and running from Artemis were fantastic ""boss battles"". I have only just begun to descend into Hades, but it is already terrifying and challenging. I eagerly look forward to what they have in store for the Dark Lord himself. This is my first review so I don't have a track record for you to follow but I highly recommend this game and will be encouraging my friends to buy.			"

												An action/platformer with well thought out gameplay. Feels a bit like an action RPG in the sense that you have a degree of freedom which of your objectives to pursue and a lot of side areas to explore, there's a lot of items to find, weapons, shields, ammunition, crafting items, healing items, buff items... add to that item shops, crafting and there's a lot to do. On the other hand every item is pretty much somehow breakable or consumable meaning you always need more. The secrets themselves are fun to look for but rarely give anything you couldn't just get otherwise. There is a degree of power progression as you get more gear, buy better training and armor over time as well as get permanent buffs for completing quests although it doesn't go into metroidvania territory and upgrades aren't neccesary to open new areas.Combat itself is fun, varied and has plenty of nuance to it, several types of weapons to use with different ranges, attack types and blind spots when you attack, you can use ranged or melee weapons or even crafted explosives and occassionally items in the enviroment to your advantage.Enemies are varied although a surprising ammount of them are more annoying than dangerous, such as hit-and-run wolves, skirmishers and archers that do their damnest to keep away from you, skeletons that refuse to permanently die and so on. Even if they're not dangerous landing a hit against some of them can be a chore. Bosses themselves are pretty well done and usually just test your skills in combat, though some get tricky as well and will involve you chasing them around the arena or looking for that one item that can temporarily incapacitate them.The game features varied enviroments, level design and often has levels distinct by structure or some gimmick that makes it memorable. When you're in Athena's realm, you have to get around through a maze filled with traps, Ares throws you in a bloody pit filled with deathmatch style combat against whoever is present and Hades will see you walking around darkness and fending off the unrelenting dead and that's just a few. This is level design done right and fits in with the personalities of the deities you face against.The graphics style as you can see is very unique and I understand some people can be turned off by it, but it very much fits the story based on greek myths and makes the game way more stylish than if it just had generic 2D greek style enviroments. The only complaint I have here is the animations look not so well at times and in some cases could do with an overhaul.Overal, unless you suffer from an irrational hate to the style, definitely try it out. Great and memorable game that could show many other games how to make level design interesting and memorable.			"

												Everyone like the Romans, but not everyone likes the Greeks.  There are so many games out there devoted to the Roman legacy, but hardly anything commemorating the Ancient Greeks!  Which is a shame to be certain, for the Greeks are full of potential for video games of all sorts of genres.  Here we have a great telling of a hero's tale as you combat the Greek Parthenon of gods and even big daddy Zeus himself to save your town and existance.Pros: The art is amazing!  The whole game is like a Greek Attic vase, and everything is visually enchanting.  The story is interesting too as you champion your way to the top of Mount Olympus to beat the snot out of Zeus and his cronies.Cons:  Occasionally the combat could get a bit tricky control wise, but you have ample opportunites to fight your way through.  Also was not able to bang Aphrodite, so....Overall: 10/10 - When in Rome, do as the Romans do.  When in Greece, go kill the gods because reasons.			"

												A fantastic game for those who don't even normally like the 2D action-platforming genre.  The various weapons and items allow for individualized playing styles and enemies stay true to greek mythology while avoiding the ridiculous portrayals common to games based on similiar lore (I'm looking at you God of War series).  The art style (Greek ""Red Figure"" and ""Black Figure"" pottery)  and mythology also serve as a treat for history buffs and classical art lovers as well. Would strongly recommend even without a sale price.			"

There are parts in the game [SPOILER WARNING] in Athenas temple where you have to jump and dodge etc. and with the current movement set these were more annoying than enjoyable.Overall a cool looking nice game, would totally buy again. I did very much enjoy the experience and the game is certainly as mentioned before not over just because the story is.You should totally get this one if you're into mythology and nice game design. 8/10			"

												Apotheon is a fantastic adventure/side-scroller. The art is beautiful, the story is great, the fighting system is pretty solid. There's plenty to do but not so much that you'll be overwhelmed. I usually don't feel led to accomplish a ton of side quests that only amount to extra loot or require a lot of running around, but something about Apotheon genuinely made me want to. Maybe it was the rich world the story takes place in, I'm not quite sure, but it was something I've found lacking in a lot of other similar games that give you free reign to explore.Sure, the game has its setbacks. Sometimes you get absolutely bombarded by enemies and it gets repetitive or stressful, the default controls can be a bit awkward (especially if you're left-handed like me, even though I'm used to having to mess around with controls for Steam games), and the game has crashed on me a couple time, but it auto-saves frequently, so it's generally no big deal. I also adore how the developers took so much time to research and properly implement different aspects of ancient Greek mythology, art, and culture into the game, you can tell a lot of love went into it. This game has made it into my top 10 favorite video games in record time, and I'm definitely looking forward to whatever the developer, Alien Trap is planning next.			"

												Immerse yourselves in the world of Ancient Mythology! The storyline has so many allusions to myths it is hard to keep track of them all (and I've yet to have got into the meat of the game!) Awesome game, great artstyle; in the style of red-figure pottery! Amazing soundtrack too.Grab it whilst it is on sale!'War is the Father of all'Heraclitus			"

												I reccommend this game, but with a few notes. It's difficult to play with the computer controls. I'd reccomend having a controller to play. The other neutral things I'd have to say about this game is it does get a bit reptitive, and can be finished in about 12 hours or so. Otherwise, the music and graphics are absolutely stunning. I've never experienced a game that is as uniquely artistic as this one is. All in all, I did enjoy, I just wish there was more!			"

YouTube™ Video: Apotheon - Let's Play 

			Views: 14		

			Ever wanted to be on Mount Olympus? Well, now you can, thanks to this amazing platformer!		

If you like scrolling platformer games, you'll like this one. If you actively dislike scrolling platformer games, you'll LIKE this one. It's more of an action RPG that takes its cues from side-scrolling platformers but doesn't really fit the bill. You have to actually make an effort to hit people and attack. You can block, switch weapons, craft potions and other stuff.Did I mention the graphics? Well, time to do that now: they're awesome. Besides the clear indication that this has a lot of Greek wall-art graphics to it, it is completely shaded. There are natural shadows, great animations and particle effects.There's atmospheric music and competent voice-over work.It's also pretty cheap so what are you waiting for? GET IT!			"

												I like this game. It tells the relationships of the gods as well as abit about the family tree. It also adds flavours from other characters from Greek lore. The names of the weapons also matched to that of Greek times. The boss battles are also epic. The stamina bar is very irritating but its essential to spice up the combat in the game. Good solid indie game. Story is very predictable and linear. The main character does not have a voice but I think it works as you can say whatever you want to the screen and imagine yourself saying this to the Gods or the other characters.8.7/10 I recommend it if you are into Greek lore and epic boss battles			"

												I haven't enjoyed a videogame as much as this one in a while. Interesting and unique setting, great soundtrack, a lot of weapons and armour to choose from, interesting different themes and setting, also you'll prolly end up learning quite a bit about Greek mythology, it even has a local multiplayer in 2015! Also can't stress the art style enough, as it's one of the best ones I've seen.Not much to write on on the cons side, I noticed a few bugs where you can glitch through objects, fall out of the map and such but they're mostly in places where you're not really supposed to be anyway. Only really annoying thing was the framerate issue (might've been but don't think it's my rig, since every other stage ran on stable 60 fps) in the central Hades level when you first go down there. It's a bit sad that multiplayer is pretty dead but like I said, local multiplayer makes up for it. Oh and I wish the hardest difficulty would be available from the start, I found Champion a bit too easy.Would buy again/10.			"

												I feel like I have spent a credible amount of time on this game, and completed it twice, once on normal and once on warrior mode, to feel like my review means something. The overview is you are living in the Ancient Greek era, and your gods have abandoned you, and you town left to be pillaged and destroyed. The game revolves around this as you have to *SPOILER* fight the rouge gods for their power over your broken planet. The final showdown is with Zeus, in which you become a God and destroy all others of you beat him.Let's begin with the art style. Set in Ancient Greece, the devs must have thought it was a great idea to make the art style like Greek pottery. They where right! It is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played! Next, the gameplay. While you think, ""oh it's a side scroller action game"" I laugh. No, it isn't. Well, partly. The thing is, you can play it to your style. If you had to call it anything, it would be a ""side scroller action adventure RPG"". This is only a certain way of playing. What I'm saying is, I didn't even use the RPG or adventure elements until my second game. I looked around a bit more in my second game and realised I hadn't explored most of the map!And one last thing - don't expect it to be an easy game. At first it's a push over, but expect puzzles, races, and bosses *cough*Zeus*cough*. So yeah, really good game.10/10 would kill the King of the cosmos with a mirror again.			"

I'll admit I enjoyed the game far more because I love ancient/mythological Greece (the references in this are on point btw) but aside form that this game really is worth it. I got around 20 hours of gameplay out of it (taking my time finding all chests, searching every nook and cranny) just fyi and I enjoyed every minute of it.			"

												This is great game, for the most part. Throughout the game there were a number of instances where I found slight errors occuring with the controls. BUT, the one thing that I found nearly unforgivable was the extreme number of control errors that I came across when battling Zeus. Not only did I experience an excessive number of controling errors, but at random points throughout the fight my potions of invulnerability would cease to work. All around this is a decent game, but the pricing feels high for me at 15 dollars, I purchased the game on sale for 7.50, which feels much more reasonable.			"

												What a wonderful game.The story was magnificent, accurate enough to please most any mythology buff, and long enough to have resolution. The main story is excellent because you can work your way towards it quickly or thoroughly. There is plenty more to discover than what is necessary to reach the end of the game. The gameplay is interesting and takes some getting used to. It is quality sidescrolling and the level design is quite excellent. Fighting (which is the main mechanic) can be tricky and frankly a bit clumsy, but it works well enough.Now the best parts of the game are the music and art. All of the levels are done in this beautiful classical era art. It is like you are playing the whole thing on the side of a vase. The music is epic in the right places, beautiful in others.Definitely a great game, probably about an 8/10 at least.			"

												Oh man I had so much fun with this game.  On every level, it was lovely, the gameplay was fun, the art style was beautiful, and the presentation of Greek Mythology was absolutely spot on.Honestly, thinking back on it now, I'm just amazed at all the things you get to do in this game! Sail the sea Play a drinking game at a party Manneuver a labyrinth Escape from a prison Hunt down a gang of assassins Explore underwater ruins Fight in a trap-filled arena Fight a Cyclops Fight underwater Fight on horseback Get turned into a stag and survive being hunted by Artemis for long enough until she turns into a stag and you get a chance to hunt her, and take turns like this until one of you kills the other!I understand a lot of people have trouble with the combat, so they come away thinking it's floaty and imprecise.  I absolutely loved the combat, so here's some advice for anyone about to start the game:  it's all about controlling the distance between you and the enemy!A spear can only damage at its point, so if a baddie gets between you and the point of your spear, you won't be able to hit him until you put some distance between you.  Spears are good if you want to stay at a distance, but you have to make sure the enemy doesn't close in on you.  Swords are close range and deal damage along their entire edge, but are easily blocked by shields.  Axes and Maces are slow to attack, but do so at an arc - if you're really good you can time your attacks to swing over an enemy shield and hit them on the head.  Swords > Spears > Axes > Swords, it's really well-balanced, and you'll be switching weapons all the time to get an advantage!On top of that, you get to explore this beautifully-drawn world of Greek pottery and meet some of the biggest names in Greek mythology as you ascend Mount Olympus.  I whole-heartedly recommend it!			"

												The study of Ancient Greek history and mythology is one of my primary hobbies so it's hard for me to gauge how much not appreciating many of/all the wonderful touches, references and stories within this game would impact someone's enjoyment. The aesthetics are perfect and, once you get used to the combat system, the game is enjoyable in its own right also. There are plenty of side missions, achievements, secrets, etc. and a wide variety of game styles are incorporated within the whole so there's something for everyone while not alienating anyone. Absolutely recommended if you have any interest in Ancient Greece whatsoever.			"

												I don't really know what to say about this game, my experience with it was somewhat mixed.Let's start with the pros, the music is awesome which is always a plus, the mythology and the story with the way its told are nice, the art style is cool and unique, the game is not short, and the voice acting is top notch.The cons outweigh the pros in my opinion, why can't I sell something from my inventory? Why the weapons have such a tight durability that it breaks before I even get to enjoy it a little bit? Why there is no meaningful progression system to feel rewarded? Why the UI and the inventory are so freaking hard to access and to use (most of the times I couldn't pick the right weapon and the right potion in mid fight because it's so confusing and insufficient to use)? These problems could be easily fixed by the developers, I don't see a reason why it's the way it is.The fighting mechanics are overly simplified, the gameplay gets repetitive easily as the art style and assets keeps repeating themselves the whole game (except for few levels which were unique with superior quality than some other levels), there is no meaningful rewards for exploration, all you get is the same few weapons, few armor upgrades (I wouldn't really call them upgrades) and some items to craft potions, that's it, The same 4 or 5 enemies types are all of what this game have, they are not really unique from each other as well,  Again my experience was mixed, it took me 15 hours to beat this game on the hard difficulty, some of these hours felt fun while most of the times it felt like a chore to finish the game, I'm barely recommending this game just for the music, the story and the concept, but overall it's just an average game that gets a 5 out of 10 in my book.

												Apotheon is one hell of a pleasant surprise. Don't let yourselrf be scared by the simple graphic style, it is a competently made game.An interesting spin on the metroidvania type of games in which you will travel to multiple areas to explore. Altohugh due to the choice made regarding the style, environments tend to differentiate little one from another. Nonetheless different areas have different rules: hub areas are mostly populated by normal people (or gods?) require you not to mess too much or guards will attack you, other areas are instead populated by beasts and monsters all will provide environmental hazards and puzzles. Secrets and puzzles are rather simple, although they can require you to travel through multiple areas in order to get correct keys, unlocking some important abilities, although not really essential or game changing.The combat is also based on few simple mechanics which tend to repeat themselves, although playing at higher difficulties will require you to use at best all the mechanics at your disposal. For as much as it is simple, the combat mechanics are well executed and robust. The combat basics use a shield and a weapon, which can vary between swords, daggers, axes, pikes and many more, with the addition of buffering potions, summons and range weapons. Each of the melee weapons behave very differently regarding damage, strike direction and wind up time, which allows for strategy in combat even though there is almost no variety of move sets for all of these weapons. The story is simple but solid: greek gods are abandoning humanity and you have been chosen (randomly) to face them and bring back to the world the gift of the gods that allowed life to prosper. Dialoges have not great animations (due to the style choice of paper cut animations), but are always voice acted and actually well voice acted (quite rare for an indie game). The story will drive you through the world of ancient greek gods with some interesting and almost educational expositions (optional).In conclusion Apotheon is a very unique type of game regarding its style and story, combining well executed metroidvania gameplay with a solid but simply melee fighting system. An easy recommendation for lovers of the style and for those who are intrigued by the choice of style and subject.			"

												I saw this game randomly when I was going through queues during the Winter Sale. It just popped on my page and I stopped and looked at it and thought ""oh. this looks nice"". Since I loved greek mythology and I know almost everything about it, I was really excited to play it and it didn't disappoint me.It is really enjoyable and the story is really nice. What I like is that you can always come back to certain areas to do stuff you didn't do. In every game I play, I never go to merchants to buy stuff unless necessary. I didn't need to talk with the merchants in this game, I found everything in boxes or chests.The story really fit into the mythology like a glove. Like it was there from the beginning. So if you are a mythology junkie like me, you'd enjoy it. The Gods' characters fit into what they are described as in the real mythology. Maybe Apollo is a bit off, but that might be just me. You know nothing about the greek mythology? NO PROBLEM. Eeeeverything is explained to you.Even though your character says nothing the whole game, you still can see the evolution of him and I think that is beautiful. The mechanics or the game are really nice and I dig having all the weapons in my inventory and being able to switch between them whenever I want. And never be overwhelmed by the weight.I do recommend this game to anybody that feels even a little that they might enjoy it.			"

												As someone who enjoys Greek mythology and adventure platformers, I am loving the hell out of this game. Lots of nooks and crannies and all kinds of wonderful things - these people clearly read their Homerica, among other works.			"

												Postives:  Story is nice and truly does feel like a greek epic  and bosses are alot of fun. All visuals are styled to be greek art you would see on a vase and it does that well Negtives: game is short. there only about 3 difftent melee  attacks and thats not if your useing a axe or club then there will be two. shops were useless as the only reason  i would ever go to one was just to upgrade armor and weapon skills and even then the only thing i  maxed out on was armor.

												 Suberb art and sound married with clunky combat and a pretty decent story. Interesting mechanics show up in the second half of the adventure that help to give some variety to an otherwise repetitive game. An decent 8 hour playthough. Recommeded.			"

												Mechanically elementary and with a basic narrative, Apotheon is an experience made worthwhile by the atmosphere it cultivates and its satisfyingly simple gameplay.			"

												Wow. This game is a masterpiece. Slowly, after fighting some gods, you grow stronger, and eventually become strong enough to kil gods. The ending of this game hit me like a wall of bricks. This game has fun combat, tight controls, and WONDERFUL storytelling.			"

												One of the best games I've played in years. Great game design, pace and not ludicrously hard for the casual gamer - although there are options to increase difficulty. This is a platformer that pays tribute to the old days but is not stuck there. I really can't wait for a sequel or similar game from the developers.10/10 "

												I thought i would take a punt on this game a while back, so glad i did. I genuinely thought platform games like this were extinct. The last platform game i enjoyed this much was Castlevania - Symphony of the Night many moons ago on a ps1.Im not comparing the two games im just saying that the fun i got from Apotheon was right up there. The style is like greek pottery has come to life, the character moves fluidly, and theres plenty to explore and find. Apotheon has everything i want to see from this kind of game.  You will have to get good at toggling between weapons though, accidently pulling the wrong weapon can be frustrating and deadly.  If they were to make an Egyptian game like this i'd be on it in an instant.			"

												pretty good gameMany people have negative things to say about the controls. I played on keyboard and mouse, and after an hour or so of awkwardness I got used to it and had no further issues. I rebound a couple things and it was fine.Interesting combat system, dozens of weapons with special properties, every boss fight is unique, satyrs walking around with visible erections. I dont know what more you could want honestly			"

												This review is completely biased. I'm a Grecco-Roman historian, and seeing the classical artwork brought to life, coupled with a fantastic soundtrack, was a total win for me. This game looks FANTASTIC. The use of classical artwork from black-figure pottery just fits, and is very true to form (no removal of Priapian appendanges, ahem). The fact that the background is actual a marble wall with the game painted on, is such a cool touch. Also, the different evnironments are unique and varierd - the forests of Artemis felt very different from the levels in Hades, and the tone was just right. The voice acting is pretty top notch too, better than some AAA games even. As should be the case, all classical figures are Britsh. This is correct and proper. The mythology of ancient Greece is nicely incorporated into the story, and the plethora of classical Greek weaponry gives a lot of diversity for playthrough. The combat can get a little hectic and clumsy at times, but the overall polish of the game overroad that for me.I only had a few stability issues, with a couple of CTD, but the autosave function is well implemented and meant that I didn't loose a lot of time.Overall, very enjoyable sidescroller, with absolutely stunning imagery, well voiced and fleshed out story, and an awesome soundtrack, which I'm intending to buy. if you'e any interest at all in Greek mythology, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game. But even without that, it's different, well paced, and stylish.			"

												The study of Ancient Greek history and mythology is one of my primary hobbies so it's hard for me to gauge how much not appreciating many of/all the wonderful touches, references and stories within this game would impact someone's enjoyment. The aesthetics are perfect and, once you get used to the combat system, the game is enjoyable in its own right also. There are plenty of side missions, achievements, secrets, etc. and a wide variety of game styles are incorporated within the whole so there's something for everyone while not alienating anyone. Absolutely recommended if you have any interest in Ancient Greece whatsoever.			"

												I don't really know what to say about this game, my experience with it was somewhat mixed.Let's start with the pros, the music is awesome which is always a plus, the mythology and the story with the way its told are nice, the art style is cool and unique, the game is not short, and the voice acting is top notch.The cons outweigh the pros in my opinion, why can't I sell something from my inventory? Why the weapons have such a tight durability that it breaks before I even get to enjoy it a little bit? Why there is no meaningful progression system to feel rewarded? Why the UI and the inventory are so freaking hard to access and to use (most of the times I couldn't pick the right weapon and the right potion in mid fight because it's so confusing and insufficient to use)? These problems could be easily fixed by the developers, I don't see a reason why it's the way it is.The fighting mechanics are overly simplified, the gameplay gets repetitive easily as the art style and assets keeps repeating themselves the whole game (except for few levels which were unique with superior quality than some other levels), there is no meaningful rewards for exploration, all you get is the same few weapons, few armor upgrades (I wouldn't really call them upgrades) and some items to craft potions, that's it, The same 4 or 5 enemies types are all of what this game have, they are not really unique from each other as well,  Again my experience was mixed, it took me 15 hours to beat this game on the hard difficulty, some of these hours felt fun while most of the times it felt like a chore to finish the game, I'm barely recommending this game just for the music, the story and the concept, but overall it's just an average game that gets a 5 out of 10 in my book.

												It is an elaborate game. By exploring the maps and by fighting each level, you can feel that the developers really put lots of effort on this game. Some levels are hardcore fights, some need strategy and dexterity. The combat experience is smooth. Using the mouse to combat in a 2D platform is actually smooth and flexible.			"

												Apotheon is one hell of a pleasant surprise. Don't let yourselrf be scared by the simple graphic style, it is a competently made game.An interesting spin on the metroidvania type of games in which you will travel to multiple areas to explore. Altohugh due to the choice made regarding the style, environments tend to differentiate little one from another. Nonetheless different areas have different rules: hub areas are mostly populated by normal people (or gods?) require you not to mess too much or guards will attack you, other areas are instead populated by beasts and monsters all will provide environmental hazards and puzzles. Secrets and puzzles are rather simple, although they can require you to travel through multiple areas in order to get correct keys, unlocking some important abilities, although not really essential or game changing.The combat is also based on few simple mechanics which tend to repeat themselves, although playing at higher difficulties will require you to use at best all the mechanics at your disposal. For as much as it is simple, the combat mechanics are well executed and robust. The combat basics use a shield and a weapon, which can vary between swords, daggers, axes, pikes and many more, with the addition of buffering potions, summons and range weapons. Each of the melee weapons behave very differently regarding damage, strike direction and wind up time, which allows for strategy in combat even though there is almost no variety of move sets for all of these weapons. The story is simple but solid: greek gods are abandoning humanity and you have been chosen (randomly) to face them and bring back to the world the gift of the gods that allowed life to prosper. Dialoges have not great animations (due to the style choice of paper cut animations), but are always voice acted and actually well voice acted (quite rare for an indie game). The story will drive you through the world of ancient greek gods with some interesting and almost educational expositions (optional).In conclusion Apotheon is a very unique type of game regarding its style and story, combining well executed metroidvania gameplay with a solid but simply melee fighting system. An easy recommendation for lovers of the style and for those who are intrigued by the choice of style and subject.			"

												I found this a really good game. The artistic style is unique and very appealing. I did a small playthrough if you wanted to get an idea of how the game functions. But overall, i highly recommend picking this up. It's well worth it. Some battles make you feel so small. lol

												Amazing game, worth every cent I've spent...1) Great artwork. 2) Amazing soundtrack. 3) Simple yet fun. 4) Good puzzles and lot of exploring to do.5) Story is rather simple and Generic though. But still interesting. 6) Game runs well and smoother than many Triple A titles....and definitely not demanding to run. 7) If you like Greek Myth, then you shouldn't pass out on this game !One down side to the game, it's not that "" replayable "" and there isn't any "" New Game + Mode "" either. But this game is currently only 17$ about 4$ USD.....so it's actually super cheap....Most games here costs about least 130 - 250$ easily..This game actually give more content than what you paid for !

 Apotheon  draws from some of the stylings of games such as  Outland,  only this time with a novel Greek theme... and also  far  less engaging.Although the game holds a very nice aesthetic value and will seem intriguing for a few minutes, you'll quickly notice the cumbersome combat and movement mechanics, as well as the monotonous choice for a musical theme that propagates itself constantly throughout the level.I shouldn't already be getting tired of a game when I've only accrued 30 minutes of playtime. I'd say this is one to avoid.			"

												An utterly excellent game whose visual aesthetic is matched in stark beauty only by its combat.  Fighting is brutal, raw, delicate business.  You are often center-stage in a ballet of wits and blades in this Greek tale.  You will feel like a heroic warrior by its conclusion, not because you wield equipment of legend, but because you ARE a legend.Faithful to the spirit of ancient Greek mythology both in story and in visual direction, this game comes with my highest recommendation to the artists, the fighters, and the metroidvania-lovers.
