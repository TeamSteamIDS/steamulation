												Even after all these years, LIMBO is still one of the greatest indie-game. It's hard to classify it: it's a platformer, but it will rarely require good timing; it's a puzzle game, but you won't spend hours trying to figure out solutions; it's a horror game, but there's no blood, no jumpscare, not even fear, just a disturbing atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend this game if someone asked me to suggest a platformer, a puzzle game or a horror game. But for someone asking for something new and/or looking for a game with a peculiar atmosphere, I wouldn't hesitate one second. PLAY THIS GAME!			"

												This game kind of makes me feel like I'm playing an old NES game but with better graphics and less fun 8-bit music. Its very simple mechanics make it quite an interesting game. You start off with no idea of what's happening, no back story, no one popping up telling you ""USE TEH ARROW KEYZ TO MOVE."" It just throws you in the game, basically telling you, ""you figure it out. You're smart, right?"" Each time you fail a puzzle at first, you learn from your mistake how to go at it in a different approach. It's a fun little game that's a good game for reminiscing about simpler game times.			"

												It's your common platformer puzzle game... made by satan.Honestly, this game was a little bit of a disappointment when it comes to the ""puzzles"", I found them quite easy, I saw a lot of hype a few years ago about this game so I thought it was pretty hard.Also the story is short, it only took me 3 hours to beat it, and an extra hour to look for a couple of achievements..On the other hand, though, this game is rather unique, both in terms of art and story, which makes this game really worth playing, just not worth the 10€ it costs.I'd suggest you to buy this game when it's on sale (Like I did) because 3/4 hours of gameplay is not worth 10€. (I'm a cheapskate, I know.)			"

												LIMBO is one of those 2-D platformer games with puzzle elements. You know, those games where you keep having to solve puzzles here and there moving objects, like crates, rocks, even dead bodies and deadly traps. I got this a long time ago, and this is the first time I actually tried playing this after casually ""finding"" it again in my library. Pros:+ The controls are nice (I used a controller myself.), it feels intuitive and doesn't really ♥♥♥♥ you over with high gravity or slippery floors. It's kinda fast paced and doesn't force you to do ridiculous jumps all the time like SMB or Electronic Super Joy. + The soundtrack consists mostly of ambient noise and fragments of something that sounds like a song here and there. I enjoy it myself, being in this shadowy world that's completely in silence really helps to build up the atmosphere. Sometimes the music gets louder, sometimes it's in complete silence (Usually before something bad happens.)+ Perhaps the thing I love the most about this game. The visuals; The whole world is black and white, with some kind of mist in the background. The characters are nothing but mere shadows, even the protagonist is a kid shrouded in shadows with just his eyes glowing. The world is gorgeous in a depressing way, after all, you're in Limbo. Forests, industrial areas, caves, lakes, even something that looks like a city. Rain pours down on you at some point, and it's nice and soothing. I really like the art style of this game. It's kinda gory too, your character can die in a wide array of painful deaths. Some are quite gory. Still, it's all in black and white, you'll see the shadows of your intestines. + The world itself. This might count towards the visuals, though. This game is quite somber, and really atmospheric. You're adventuring into the unknown, and you'll find all kinds of weird stuff along the way. You'll find corpses all around, some of them suicide victims. Even the living beings in Limbo are hostile towards you. It truly is a cold and unforgiving world.Neutral:+/- This game gets quite challenging later on. This might be a con for some, a pro for others. Personally, I enjoy it myself. You simply CAN'T finish this game without dying quite a few times on the first run, because they game changes its rules at times, teases you, punishes you for taking the ""easy"" route. Sometimes, deaths are swift and gory, with less than a second to react. This game is a lot of trial and error, just like you'd expect from a game like this.-/+ Another pro for some, con for others. This game is quite short. Puzzles are time consuming, and I dare to say, frustrating often, specially near the end of the game. Unless you use a guide, you might get stuck in there for a while. But if you know what to do and you don't die that often, you can easily finish this game in a couple of hours. Cons:-  The trial and error IS unforgiving near the end. I personally enjoy this, again, but there are some parts where the game goes too far. I specially hate puzzles where your timing and positioning's gotta be spot on, or else you won't make it. This is INCREDIBLY frustrating if you're trying to get one of the game achievements, where you gotta die less than 5 times and finish the game in a single sitting. Sometimes, you know what to do, you know what to expect, but you were a few pixels away from the ideal position, and less than a second off. There, you're dead. I enjoy games that kick your♥♥♥♥♥with cheap deaths here and there, but I know lots of people would feel discouraged by this. - I won't tell you exactly what happens near the end, but you might not like it if you were expecting something amazing to happen. The journey was worth it for me. But the ending felt kinda weak.All in all, I would recommend picking this game up in a sale. If you are into puzzle/platformer games (I am not, sadly. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed), this is quite an interersting title. The visuals and ambience alone are worth it for me, and the game's short enough for me to avoid giving up in frustration before completing it.			"

												LIMBO is a puzzle platformer indie title released in mid 2010. It was originally released as an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive, before eventually moving to the PlayStation and PC in 2011, it latter got  another port to PlayStation Vita and iOS, and yet another one onto the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, this goes to show just how popular this game is and how well received of a title it was. This is a 2D side scroller platformer which uses the Box2D physics engine, which you may of heard of because it is also used in Angry Birds, and plenty of online Flash Games.  You play as a young boy, and travel through the world filled with dangers and traps as you search for your lost sister.  The puzzles in this game have a very trial and error theme to them. You probably will die a few times on the puzzles before you figure out the correct way of doing it. Each death comes with a horrific image of the poor boys rag dolled body plummet, get chopped up, speared, drowned, pretty much any sort of tragic death, this poor lad will go through it all. The graphics are very simple, but very elegantly produced. Its a 2D side scroller so don't expect to see mind blowing realistic graphics; what LIMBO offers is beautifully crafted black and white tones. it is amazing how much atmosphere is generated just from the colour tones alone. The use of light and grain effects really create a spooky atmoshphere which alot of games try to produce but fail to capture as well as LIMBO.  This game is often used as an example that videos games should be classed as a form of art. LIMBO has a very open ended story; the main plot is you are trying to find your lost little sister; and that's about as much information as you get. I don't want to spoil the ending too much, but I was a LITTLE bit disappointed with it and I really hope that there might be a sequel eventually to this game to find out more. There is next to no audio in the game, and no music. All of the sound effects are very minimalist, this fits in well with the spooky atmosphere which is being created, and probably makes it feel all that more eerie A couple of puzzles in LIMBO had me scratching my head quite a bit before I was finally able to figure out what to do. I would warn you - there is a lot of jumping style puzzles and platforming events to get through. In my opinion, jumping puzzles are the worst, but they obviously have to be in platforming games so I just had to battle on through. The game does offer a very good respawn/checkpoint system though. If you die, you won't end up miles and miles behind where you just were, you'll normally spawn right before you messed up to let you try again - this made the trial and error mechanic work so much better as you don't have to replay content you have just got past. This game's world is so well made, yet it doesn't have anything to interact with other than the puzzles, the minimalist theme keeps you on track the whole time, and you have little chance to explore off the track, simply because there is nothing to explore, it's a one track minded game, essentially you need to get from A to B, and you cannot come off the track. That's not necessarily a bad thing; games these days are often too ""open world"" style, and often overwhelm the player with too much to see. I liked how LIMBO kept me focused on the task at hand, which was the puzzles and progressing through the dark world I was in. To play LIMBO from start to finish, it took me just under eight hours. That felt like the perfect length for the game, I would of liked to see a little more of the plot unfold, but it does leave it open ended for a possible sequel in the future. I see little reason to play it through more than once. It's 100% linear, and you will always end up with the same outcome and even the puzzles don't have more than one way to complete them, so unless you want to go achievement hunting, there is no reason to replay LIMBO. LIMBO is certainly a highly popular game, and is so for good reason. The game does very little wrong in any of the criteria, and it showcases just how an indie game should be developed and published. The game has gone from strength to strength since being released on Xbox Live, and it still alive and kicking on the current gen consoles. For the price of £6,99, you are getting a simply amazing game.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Limbo is for me, truly original piece of art. Dark, harsh tone, black and white gore, and challenging puzzles are major pluses. Other thing i adore, is vizualization itself. This all together brings unforgettable gaming experience. Even though i said puzlles are big plus, they are also a minor minus. I felt that, sometimes are just too hard, especially when i was closer to the end. Some people find this type of challenge great, but at some point, i was discouraged to finish this game. In the end i really enjoy playing this game, it was different type of joy, depressive joy i could say.Grade: A "

												A game as intuitive and creative as it is cold, lonely, and bleak. The young boy's journey through the darkness and the many threats hidden throughout it is a breathtaking experience.

												It is hard to state something like this when you're talking about one of the most famous indie game ever released, but here we go: I hate LIMBO. What I cannot really stand is its illogical way to present the puzzles, as to the player is rarely given the opportunity to recognize a danger and work out for a solution. The whole game is just a repetitive exercise of attempt->death->retry->death->solution found->new death. The death in LIMBO is not a punishment for the player's mistake, but the only possibility to find the solution to a puzzle. Frustration above satisfaction, you'll never solve a puzzle because you're good, but because you died enough to understand the only way to pass a section of the level. Praises go to the art style and to the atmosphere, and to the decision to have merciful checkpoints. Not enough for me.			"

												Limbo is horrifically beautiful.  It’s horrible, but startlingly pretty. A 2D puzzle-platformer built in black, grey and white. The figure of a young child hangs limply from a noose. Death is everywhere. White butterflies that flutter gently by are the only sign of hope. The boy you control has a twee outline, all floppy hair and short trousers. The boy’s task? To find his sister. That’s all you need to know. There is no back story, no dialogue or cutscenes. Just the drive to push on through the shifting mists and silhouettes of the game’s environments and puzzles.Trial-and-error makes up a large park of Limbo, a game where death isn’t just likely but often a prerequisite to understand the mechanics of a puzzle. But these tasks usually delight more than they frustrate. Most are fiendishly clever without being obtuse and the satisfaction comes in pulling each apart piece by piece. They’re tremendously varied too; some play with perception, while others see fit to flip gravity. There’s plenty of puzzles that run through the game’s short but perfectly formed running time of around five hours. And underpinning them all is good old-fashioned twitch platforming, with you maneuvering the boy; jumping, moving crates, and swinging across bottomless ravines.Overall verdict: Highly recommended!

												LIMBO is a superlative illustration of a dystopian world. Nightmares turn into reality for a small boy who wakes up in this pitch-black cataclysm. With nothing to tell him where to go or what to do, he wanders forth into the unknown.From the short introduction into the boy's predicament, the shadows and darkness encroach him in a perfect noir setting. The graphics are simple, but compliment the setting impeccably. The game runs perfectly on any machine, and never leaves a steady frame rate, running at 60 frames per second on higher-performance machines.Sound effects in LIMBO are stunning. An eerie atmospheric stereo soundtrack sounds so realistic with headphones, it's almost like you are in the game. Water, footsteps and enemies sound mysterious and create a mood that both intrigues and repels, which is a rarity in video game soundtracks.LIMBO's story is one of mystery. The solemn-looking boy has no words, but at the same time he can convey a meaningful message of despair and sorrow. His agility is quite good, even if his jump is somewhat feeble. The platforming elements of LIMBO are simple, but work wonderfully. Ladders, boats and vines are utilised in obvious but unique ways, and makes gameplay different after every stage. Enemies are not the only threat in LIMBO. Yes, there is a giant spider, but you can die just as much by this than a gap in the floor or vicious spikes protruding out of the ground in hap-hazard directions. Death is everywhere in LIMBO, and the scene painted by Playdead is definitely bone-chilling.In my opinion, LIMBO is a wonderfully dark portrait of a universe that both frightens and invites. LIMBO is definitely melancholy, but its wonderful mechanics, story, sounds and controls combine to create a game that should be a must-have for anyone who enjoys an unknown adventure. LIMBO's world left me speechless, but at the same time I wouldn't hesitate to dive into its hellish depths again.			"

												We, as gamers have grown, but you know what, so have games! And they seem to be evolving on many fronts and in many different directions. Playdead the studio behind the Xbox 360 title LIMBO, has given us an example of how far games can go as an art form. No, this is not ""just another platformer"". Anyone who dives into LIMBO's arty, black-and-white world, will surely find a good reason to stay. The gameplay itself might be a tad reminiscent of other puzzle-flavored platform classics such as Another World, and even recent titles such as Super Meat Boy and Trine. Heart of Darkness also comes to mind. Even so, LIMBO has a feel of its own.The central character, a small pale-eyed kid, awakens alone in a murky forest, surrounded by massive trees and a few wondering animals (maggots, tiny butterflies and so on).This is what marks the player's first step into the sinister world of LIMBO. No fancy story, no complex sci-fi universe, no pompous character outlines, no feeble voice-overs... just the tranquil sounds of the deep, black forest. However, as soon as our tiny hero sets out, those tranquil sounds soon transform into a range of rather unsettling noises. Stepping into LIMBO is rather like entering a bleak world of shadows, with but a few flickering light sources that barely manage to outline the silhouettes of nearby objects and creatures.The creepy forest is no place for a little boy, so it's best to help him get out of danger as soon as possible. LIMBO's perilous dim environment will have you facing dangers around every corner and almost every step could lead our petite hero into a perfectly laid trap. If he isn't cut by exceedingly sharp bear traps or sliced to bits by spinning razor blades, he'll mostly likely run into a blood-thirsty creature. The game throws the player into a series of tough situations where the main character has to fight for his life against overwhelming odds. The game often requires you to get out of these situations by thinking and reacting swiftly, otherwise the cute little boy may get chopped to bits or eaten by something unpleasant.What's unique about this game is the way it progressively throws different problems your way, without warning and yet somehow always leaves enough time and space for you to solve things on your own. Each step forward tosses you into bigger dangers and tougher physics-based puzzles, in turn may lead to even greater challenges. That's right, physics play an important role as you attempt get out of a range of difficult situations. The puzzles rarely feel repetitive, which was a Godsend. There was an obvious effort by the developers to constantly present something new and unexpected for the player. As a result, the game becomes a joy to play.It's even more fun to watch and listen, because of its stylish graphics and equally effective audio backdrop. Again, this game doesn't feature fancy graphics, epic soundtracks or a massive cast of top-rated voice actors. Every time a melody starts swelling in the background, that usually means you're in trouble. The ambient music is a perfect match for the game's distinctive art style.This independently developed title deserves a spot among its many triple-A counterparts, largely because it succeeds in grabbing the attention of both hardcore gamers, as much as those who prefer casual gaming. This highly appealing indie game craves more content though. Well, just more levels, really. Nothing more. It ends to damn quickly. And that's about the only thing I could find wrong with it. LIMBO may seem like a small ripple in a giant ocean of games, but from where I'm standing, this tiny ripple could easily steer us towards new heights, as games continue to evolve as an art form. It immerses players almost effortlessly thanks to its sleek design and delightfully subtle lighting effects and creepy-looking shadows. LIMBO represents a skillful blend of puzzle-based gameplay mechanics and unique visuals. There isn't an aspect of this game that feels redundant or flimsy. Even though the game left me hungry for more challenges and an altogether lengthier experience, I still see this one as a classic that shouldn't be missed out on.			"

This is a rather long review, so if you want a summary of why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.Playdead games strikes gold with the hit title LIMBO. LIMBO is a game which keeps you guessing with interesting puzzles, complex scenarios, and an intriguing story. The games artistic styling’s does not seem cheap, but rather creates an ambience that makes LIMBO seem rather elegant. Summary:LIMBO is a side scroller where you play a young boy who is on an adventure to seek his missing sister. The game is a platform game with integrated puzzles to solve in order to progress through to the next part of the game. The grey-tone of the game creates a rather fearful and discerning environment where a gruesome fate looks poetic. The game gets progressively harder and the puzzles become more challenging as you progress, although once you get a hang of the game you'll figure out it’s not too difficult. You meet many challenges along the way from rising water levels, monsters that force you in a direction, rope swinging, traps, and more that keep you on your toes. LIMBO is a great game which offers fantastic yet horrific scenery, music, and ambience. The game keeps you on your toes and the clever grayscale art style allows a rather terrifying world to be poetic. Controls:My major gripe about this game was the control system. Although, I write a lot about this, it is actually a rather minuscule problem and doesn't at all ruin the games experience. You cannot edit the controls from inside the game, because the developers decided not to allow key-mapping within the games interface you must exit the game and edit the settings file within the LIMBO steamapps folder. The controls are worse because the jump command which is listed in the settings file is not an actual command in the game; there are only five commands: Left, Right, Up, Down, and Use. There are no resolution settings, so if you are using an odd resolution you may have problems playing this game. The one complaint I have towards this game is that character doesn't always respond well to the controls, which causes a lot of deaths that could easily be avoided if the character control system was better. Gameplay Hints:>When you get a brain slug running under the light allows you to turn the other direction.>The ""up"" key (mine was W) is not a jump key, it moves you up and coincidently this means you jump with it. When gravity field reverses you must use the ""down"" key (S) rather than ""up"" key (W) to jump as you are moving down. >Do not hold the ""up"" key while on a rope as if you do clicking the ""left"" or ""right"" key will jump you off the rope. If you are not holding the ""up"" key then you will just swing left and right gaining momentum.Results:Overall this game is a fun, the puzzles are challenging, difficulty curve is smooth, scenery is fabulous, ambience is frighteningly amazing, gameplay is elegant, and the symbolism makes the story phenomenal. I would completely recommend this game. I purchased it at a discount, but if I knew it was this fun I would have paid full price.Pros:+Amazing environment+Great level design+Challenging puzzles+Mysterious and freaky ambience+Fun achievements+Great checkpoint system+Beautiful story+Not too long, but not too short+Very fun secret achievementCons:-No key mapping within the actual game-No resolution settings-Poor character control (it is not too bad once you get used to it, but at first its hard to get used to)			"

Grim journey somewhere between the worlds.It's about: anxiety, tension, fear, darkness and macabre atmosphere; jumping and solving puzzles.Why you should play this: you like horror games (try it even if you don't like horror games); you like platformers and puzzles; thoughtful level-design with hidden areas; small details in level's enviroment, a lot of shades - game doesn't look simplistic due to using only 2 colors; great sound effects; tricky, but simple puzzles.Why you may not like it it's difficult to make yourself start to play - game looks too melancholy; black-white design sometimes does not allow to define where's active object and where's just a scenery; despite the fact that puzzles are mostly simple you can stick because it's not always clear what the puzzle is - it's like cracking unfinished riddle.Lack of colours, no dialogs, no intro or outro, no word at all and, yet, such unbeleivable level of expression.

												Limbo’s distinctive experience just as much as it's a 2D platformer with puzzle elements. The game in motion is a sight to behold and if you enjoy any kind of black and white art this game will most likely satisfy your chiaroscuro fancies a plenty.The puzzle platforming itself is nice and varied and entertaining throughout and though a game such as this doesn't lend itself to much replayability the initial 5 hours or so it takes to finish the game are well worth the modest price of the game if you enjoy the genre and the beautiful if macabre setting and art direction. Even if you don’t but appreciate a well crafted interactive entertainment it’s a must play.			"

												I'm not a big fan of platformer games. But this is one of a few I finished and I really enjoyed. Maybe because it's just not a typical platformer. There is more than just jumping and solving easy puzzles. Of course those elements are also included, except some puzzles are not so easy.This more is atmosphere. This is one of the most atmospheric game I've ever played. Lights, sound, opponents, all elements create gloomy and violent, but beautiful world. This is really one of rare examples, when gaming is combined with art.VERDICT:I recommend this game to absolutely everybody. Maybe not for small children, cause it may be too scary for them.Like this review?

												Gorgeous, unique silhouette art style with incredible subtle lighting effects; amazing sound design that actually helps you play the game; surprisingly rich atmosphere for such a minimalistic game; great gameplay (after a bit of getting used to your character's more realistic maneuverability compared to most video game heroes); puzzles so clever you'll think Valve went 2d.  And to top it all off, the hidden eggs and bonus level are that rare kind of super-fair, intuitive challenge, rather than over-the-top nonsense.  The biggest gripe would be that there are a handful of points in the game where you have to simply wait around for a bit too long, but it's nothing major.If you still haven't played this, give it a go.  It's a small game with a one-of-a-kind atmosphere and everything about it just fits right.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.One of the strangest game I've played in years this one! When you hear the title of this game, you think it could be a party game. Instead, it really is a dark, horrifying platformer, where you have to guide a cute little boy through the dark world called Limbo: A place between heaven and hell. At least that is what has been told. In fact, there is no storyline at all. All that you know is that the boy wakes up in a dark forest, and has to make it's way to the end.It will not be an easy walkover, though: The further you get, the harder it will become. The boy will easily fall victim to a cruel and painful death.Overall: Limbo offers a variety of incredible puzzles, outstanding visual/sound design, and an immersive world that you will not want to come out of.If you would like to play an original, challenging platformer, Limbo is surely recommendable.

												You are a boy searching for his missing sister. You wander through gloomy forests, explore forbidding caves and try to escape a industrial complex of whirring machines and smoke stacks – all painted in silhouette against the smoky greys of an old flickering film. It's amazing that such a simple approach can create such a nightmarish atmosphere.'Simple' is an excellent word to sum up this indie platform game. From its monochrome presentation to its single sentence storyline, it creates a spare, deadly, lonely world, devoid of colour and distraction. You brave yawning landscapes with nothing but the rustling of your feet to keep you company. Large sections of the game are silent but for the occasional drip of water, or a cavernous echo, sometimes punctuated by fractured, urgent music, or footsteps racing into the distance. The only humans you come up against are hostile, chasing you away with spears and darts.Everything in Limbo is out to harm you. From the moment the scenery come to life when that first giant spider-leg unfurls, a hundred times more menacing than it has any right to be, you're in world that doesn't want you there.It's a meat grinder, coldly snapping beartraps around your fragile little frame, crumbling the boy into a pile of body parts. It stresses you into making mistakes: you know exactly what horrible thing is about to happen to your little ward when presented with a pressure plate and a crushing device.Limbo's obstructions are grossly imaginative, requiring morbid solutions: one puzzle's resolution comes when you drag a corpse into a pool so you can use it as a bloated, floppy stepping stone to the other side. When not being chased by implacable spiders with a penchant for skewering bodies, you'll be feverishly searching for floating crates to ride as water rises above your ankles, or plucking the remaining leg off a maimed spider and rolling its body to block spikes and clamber to a ledge.Limbo's initial morbid world of beartraps, corpses and ravenous arachnids eventually leads you into industrial levels, full of more conventional puzzles, such as gravity switches, elevators and even machinegun turrets. It's around this mark that the puzzles become far more frustrating, requiring precision timing to progress. You'll occasionally be reduced to a weeping mess of tears and tantrums, defeated by a straightforward but deadly puzzle that can only be overcome by getting everything just so.I spent a lip-gnashing, keyboard smashing 20 minutes trying to run across a length of railway track before a descending minecart hit a switch to electrify the rails. Twenty damn minutes watching my boy judder as his tiny legs failed to make the last jump.Your most horrific foes are the brain slugs, which drop from above and burrow into your skull. Once nestled in your cranium, they force you to stagger in one direction – normally straight into a pit of spikes.Make no mistake: you're going to die. A lot. It's impossible to pass five minutes without succumbing to Limbo's sick snags. But finally realising the infuriatingly simple solutions and achieving that bloody jump will reward you with Portalsized feelings of smugness and relief.It's a little disappointing to have waited a year for this game to get ported to PC only to find keyboard control is locked to the cursor keys, but in spite of that – and Limbo's short playtime (around three to five hours) – you simply cannot miss out on this darkly evocative experience. It has its frustrations, but it's a beautiful argument for games as art.Limbo is a beautifully designed masterpiece of a platform game, that will chill, challenge and charm in equal measure. 8.5/10			"

												Good platform game. The gameplay is based on puzzles that are smart and sometimes challenging, and they do a competent use of physics. The game has a great gloomy look, summarizing his name, the artwork is well done as well as the sound effects. Overall the game is solid. The plot is not openly covered, is more a concept of a search for the understanding of what is happening. It's short and somewhat relaxing, good game to play in a calm day and without commitment. 7.5/10			"

												You'll have to learn the game mechanics ( You' learn those in the first chapters ).You'll think the game is easy.You'll see the game is not easy.You'll die over and over and over and over again.You'll have to try again.You'll be frustrated.You'll be disappointedYou'll be desperate.You'll learn from your mistakes.You'll be happy when you finished a chapter.You'll get rewarded.You'll have fun.So as you hopefully can see this game is fun because you get rewarded for finishing a chapter in wich you died so damn often and tried over and over again and finnaly be happy.Story:There is no real story.Graphics:It's a 2D black-white game it doesn't need good graphics, it's all about the atmosphere.Sound: The sound is very inportant in this game it's important for the atmosphere.So overall I'd recommend this game as it's compelling and fascinating how easy it can be to make a great game without a story and good 3D graphics.

												The contrasty monochromatic film look in combination with the whimsical animations of some of the highly silhouetted characters really make for an interestingly eerie horror feel.

												If you've ever played a creepy black-and-white platformer, it doubtless owes Limbo a debt for paving the way. Its release on Xbox Live Arcade nearly seven years ago practically opened up a new genre of platformers to explore, those that unsettle and perplex with their ominous atmosphere and threatening aesthetic. We're a long way out from those heady days, and it's worth considering how well Limbo holds up now especially in the wake of its spiritual successor, Inside. But I can tell you up front, even coming to it now for the first time you won't be disappointed.Limbo starts you off with no fanfare whatsoever, as a silhouetted child awakening in a forest. With no guidance you head rightward in search of something, probably not the deadly traps and machines and creatures that you find, though. Your journey will take you through the darkest parts of the forest, the forgotten corners of industry, and the decrepit heights of the city, with death awaiting you at every turn. There are no items and no real enemies, just you scrambling through a world that feels like it very much does not want you there.As far as gameplay goes, you run, jump, climb, and push things. Your jump is a sad little hop that skews pretty hard on the realistic side, but levels are designed with this in mind and being more ground-bound helps keep your options focused. You'll need to do plenty of mantling up ledges and swinging on ropes, along with no shortage of crate pushing, log pushing, rock pushing, and so on. These skills will help you traverse the dangerous territories of Limbo, usually by overcoming some basic trap or hazard but later by clearing a path through more complex puzzle rooms.It's important to note that the traps and puzzles never feel contrived, as they always have some discernible purpose in the bleak world you find yourself in. Spike pits and bear traps were clearly built by someone, machines have gears and hatches to negotiate, and the creatures you meet behave in strange and wild ways as suits their designs. Puzzles in Limbo tend to be the gratifying kind, the ones that make you feel clever for sorting them out even if they're simple to begin with. It's thanks to some straight-forward design that makes solutions seem obvious, along with some excellent environmental detailing that helps obscure the most obvious parts.There are aspects of the game that are left too vague, however. Limbo has no shortage of ways to kill your hapless child but isn't always clear on how it plans to do it. A lot of deaths can easily be described as cheap the first time you encounter them by springing an unseen trap or not reacting to some new mechanic quick enough. The prime example for me is a pair of crushers in a cave about 1/3 of the way in. The first one has a raised plate, and if you step on it, you're safe; stepping on any other part kills you. The second one is the exact opposite, with the plate calling down instant death. This kind of design guarantees that nearly every single player will die at least once here, with survival being a literal matter of luck.Death isn't a big deal in Limbo because the checkpoints are numerous and respawning happens swiftly. Still, the frequent unforeseen deaths have the potential to frustrate and are only really mitigated by how well they fit with the atmosphere. The lo-fi monochrome graphics give the game a terribly ominous and solitary feel that is built upon by the many unsettling and downright disturbing sights you'll come across. Atmosphere is Limbo's greatest asset, with few games even getting close to its horrific feel. Every time you see a new creature or device or even a shadow in the background you'll be wondering if you should fear it, even though you likely will already.The sharp design elements that made Limbo an instant classic so many years ago have not dulled in the slightest. The aesthetic is still at the top of the genre, the puzzles remain clever and rewarding despite a glut of similar platformers, and the simple gameplay does not get old through the 2 or so hours it will take to finish (though be prepared for an extremely abrupt and unclear ending). There are some secrets to find if you're diligent, but really the beautiful, haunting journey is what you want to focus on here. It's just as good as it was at release, and anyone who likes their platformers creepy should have already gotten on this by now.			"

Somewhere near the halfway point, almost all encounters with living creatures stop and the player is introduced to nothing but puzzle after puzzle all the way to the endMy complaint about the puzzles themselves is that they are based too heavily on trial and error. There are few puzzles that a player could look at, predict how it would respond, and plan a solution for.I finished Limbo in 2-3 hours.			"

												An independent platformer developed by a Danish company called Playdead. Limbo has a unique, eerie atmosphere that usually characterises the horror genre. The atmosphere is the result of the dark (black and white) presentation and the lack of music throughout the adventure.It is one of those trial-and-error games where in order to successfully solve a puzzle in many cases you either need to react quickly or you have only one chance for a perfect execution. If you fail you can start all over from the previous checkpoint and you should also watch how the boy dies (often in quite a gruesome way). To be honest, I can easily imagine that this unique presentation deters some gamers from even trying out the game. Its trailer, in fact, presents the game's one-of-a-kind aesthetics very well.There is a nice learning curve here and the game has some easter eggs for you to collect - mainly for the purpose of extra achievements, of course. If you love hardcore gaming you can complete Limbo in one sitting with fewer than 5 deaths to earn the hardest achievement of the game.Limbo has a unique atmosphere. While it is not a long platformer it certainly is a great game. Unfortunately, due to its length and genre I consider 10 EUR a bit too expensive - still, we all know there are regular discounts so until it happens it deserves a place in everybody's wishlist.			"

YouTube™ Video: Limbo Review 

			Views: 119		

			We take a look at the eerie, gorgeous, 2D puzzle platformer Limbo! http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Limbo shows that it doesn’t take a massive budget, or massive explosions, or gpu melting 3D visuals to make an amazing gaming experience. The game is actually about as bare bones as it gets when it comes to both game mechanics and visuals yet it’s the simplicity that makes the game a truly amazing gaming experience. Limbo is a 2D puzzle platformer game that puts you in control of a silent young boy who finds himself in a dark, mysterious, incredibly dangerous, forest where everyone and everything is out to get him.The game boasts a gorgeous black and white atmospheric art style that perfectly portrays the emotion filled nightmare of a world that you have been placed in. The eerie sounds pair perfectly with the creepy visuals to completely immerse in in the beautifully designed levels. The game makes sure not to distract you from the gorgeous simplicity, as there are no interrupting cut scenes, dialogue, HUD, or tutorial, from start to finish the game is one seamless experience.As you control the young boy you are limited to simply ‘jump’ and pushing or pulling of various objects, so to say you’re defenseless against the creepy crawlers that lurk in the dark would be an understatement. You must use your wits and react quickly to out maneuver and outsmart the faster, stronger enemies who wait around every corner. The controls are tight and precise and the physics are realistic, there won’t come a time when you die from missing a jump and feel like you were robbed. The puzzles get progressively harder and harder throughout the game, however there was only one time that I became too frustrated with the game and had to take a short break. The game isn’t difficult per se, however you will die a lot, the game will kill you with what are seemingly cheap deaths just for the sake of killing you, but each death is meant as a learning experience, and you won’t be too badly punished as the game re-spawns you within feet from where you died. This type of “trial by error” gameplay teaches you how the environment around you responds to your actions without having to include an obnoxious, intrusive tutorial to hold your hand through the game.Overall the game is relatively short and shouldn’t take any longer than 3-4 hours to complete from start to finish. But don’t let the short play time discourage you from picking up this absolute gem of a game or you could easily miss out on one of the finest platforming experiences available on PC. The beauty and simplicity of the game is what makes Limbo feel so refreshing, the beautiful art style and magnificently eerie environment will completely immerse you in this demented, mysterious, world. The controls are spot on and the puzzles are challenging enough that you will feel accomplished when you complete one. Limbo is a seamless masterpiece from start to finish with the only downside being that you’ll keep craving more.   "

Steps over some spilled oil and reaches the other side. He gets a call on his phone and doesn't notice a cyclist who knocks him back into the road. Bob gets his by a car.Welcome to Limbo. Population: Bob. But first, an English lesson.  Skill (noun) ~ the ability, coming from one's knowledge, practice, aptitude, etc., to do something well. Usage: ""The dancers performed with skill.""Recollection (noun) ~ the act or power of recollecting, or recalling to mind; remembrance. Usage: ""Bob had perfect recollection of everything he did wrong when crossing the street.""It's too bad that the developers of this game confused these two. There is apparently some underlying artistic expression happening in Limbo related to depression and suicide. So they sat down one day and figured the best way to express that was to just kill the player over and over again by making it impossible to progress without actually having fore-knowledge of what will happen next. Then they remembered that they were actually supposed to be making a game and threw in some puzzles, some of which were very clever but ultimately the result is that Limbo feels like it wants to be doing two very different things and can't make up its mind.Schizophrenic design and a focus on the theme of depression... somehow they didn't think it was a bad idea on paper. I'll say this though, they certainly captured the essense of suicide. Because they completely killed any hope of this game being entertaining.As a final note, the game is sickeningly violent. That may seem like an odd thing to say because the game is all greyscale but the fact is that the developers have intentionally gone to great lengths to make the main character's deaths as vivid as possible. The game repeatedly has the main character dismembered, bisected, beheaded, crushed and impaled all with gruesome detail both visually and aurally. You can hear the bones crunch and flesh tear as well as see and hear blood splatter. It isn't pleasent and it may be the singular reason for the high reviews as many see this kind of morbid stuff as highly entertaining. Furthermore if you are a parent looking to buy this for a child, thinking that it is harmless, you need to look elsewhere.			"

Limbo has an abundance of richness, from the detailed environments & character animations, to the eerie depth of view created from the monotone colour palette with the blurring/film grain effects applied on top. Artistic styling is unique giving a strong dreamy/nightmare? feel that really sucked me in. Subtle use of sound, initially feels lacking but actually enhances the atmosphere & is also used as a mechanic in some of the fantastic physics based puzzles found throughout. These puzzles above everything else were what kept me hooked till the end.The levels are extremely well designed, dark & foreboding, telling in part their own story without words. They are short but varied, often introducing new elements keeping things fresh & always offered a challenge. Levels seamlessly merge together. Some parts left me scratching my head for quite some time, not only requiring some complex problem solving but in true platformer fashion, also precise timing. I found this difficult at times as the character jump has a bit of a delay & movement in general is relatively slow but I did adjust to it to a degree. The spider sections in particular freaked me out (yeah I don’t like spiders!), the animations were so lifelike with it always looming close by. Fantastically done!


Friggin' Spiders .. it had to be spiders! 
A Screenshot of LIMBO
By: Aussiedroid




Everything in Limbo’s design seems to click; there is simplicity in the mechanics, lean, ensuring only things that are needed are introduced. From the two button controller config (Jump & Activate) to only having items to interact with that have a purpose, to level designs that don’t have redundant sections. Even saving progress is streamlined, with frequent automatic save points that gave me zero frustration. You can also easily reload a section to replay or hunt for the numerous hidden Easter Eggs as well. All in all, there is nothing I can really fault. Limbo is a thoroughly enjoyable, masterfully tailored ride!Limbo’s is on the shorter side. For me, it took around 5hrs on my first play, but it is possible to complete speed runs in around an hour if you know your way around so your mileage may vary. I personally found this to be a good length as it is a quality experience that doesn’t get stale or repetitive as you progress. That being said, I wouldn’t mind exploring a new dream in a Limbo 2 one day! :)If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												LIMBO is a side scroller puzzle game, developed and published by Playdead (creators of the spiritual successor, INSIDE). I cannot say much about this game's review so let's talk about gameplay, art style and theme of the game. I got this game for free when Playdead announced LIMBO would be free to celebrate their latest release, INSIDE (you should check it out, yo). You play as a lost boy who mysteriously arrived in the forest without explanation (You can interpret things what is going on). The theme of the game is monochromatic with minimalistic feel (no HUD or anything at all) and disturbing content. You come across with puzzles as you progress throughout the game and they are clever design that made stupidly easy and also required timing and reaction time. This game is very difficult than it would be. The soundtrack is well designed as well. The duration of this game is short (at least 3 and a half or less than that if you are speed runner player).+ Pros+ Level Design+ Mystery Story in your own interpretation+ Monochrome with minimalistic art style+ Immersive Sound Design+ Pacing- Cons- There's nothing negative about this game (unless you whinge about the difficulty of the game, so feel free to put that as a con for some)Overall, this game is such a great game. The best platform game I have ever played. The level design, mystery story, the minimalistic art style and clever puzzle design made me push forward to finish the game. You can go back and start a new game again to find the secret eggs or finish the game at minimum 5 deaths, in order to get achievements. I highly recommend this game, it's a 10 out of 10, a highly recommended game to play.			"

												Indie games, like everything else in gaming, is hit or miss. Some indie games attempt to bring something new to the table while others take a familiar formula and mix it up a bit. Limbo is the latter taking elements from games that veteran gamers will probably recognize, but put in a package that has not been seen before.In Limbo, you control a boy that’s looking for his sister in Limbo. Yes that’s all you get for storyline because there will be plenty of interpretations of the plot once the gaming public gets their hands on it. There are so many nuances and details throughout the game that you feel that there’s a deeper story hidden, and the only way to learn about that story is to replay certain areas again and again to see how it all fits. A common theme you’ll find in this review that the simplistic look and gameplay of Limbo is just the surface of this complex game.Reminiscent of an indie film, Limbo is only done in black and white. No colors or 3D, but instead a very animated 2D style. Your character has a very artistic look to him with only white eyes on a black silhouette, and the world has many instances where the objects and creatures on screen are simply mesmerizing. Again, what comes to mind when playing through this game are those movies that choose black and white rather than color to give their film a distinct yet considerably powerful look to it as Limbo has done. Keeping the game devoid of color, your mind wants to almost see the color that should be there making you pay even more attention to those object that should have some sort of color to it. Then there are scenes that are so detailed that you may overlook the lack of color because you see so much around you that color becomes not important. It’s simply an impressive sight to see a game that has no color yet provides such artistic imagery.As the graphics of Limbo remind me of various black and white movies, the game itself brings back memories of multiple games that I’ve played throughout my time as a gamer. Essentially the game combines platforming that most gamers are familiar with, and puts you in puzzle situations that require a lot of thought. As you make your way through the level, you’ll eventually come to an obstacle of some sort. Whether it be a ledge too high to reach, a body of water to traverse, or a creature in your way, it will be your task to figure out how to get by as your character does not have any abilities aside from jumping, running, and interacting with objects.Not only does your character not have any abilities, but the boy is frail. In the words of Until We Win host Lord Kat, you’re going to die... a lot. You can’t swim, survive long drops, defend yourself against creatures, or even take a hit to the head from a box falling from a certain height. Limbo might as well have been called ""Trial andError"" as you will be doing that for hours on end. Thankfully the developers Play Dead Studios (kind of fitting that they would have ""dead' in their name) made dying less of a hassle. The game is split into areas where the puzzle is located. This means you’ll always find yourself right when the puzzle starts, and you can’t get any further until you pass the puzzle. The deaths in the game are particularly brutal making for this to be the bloodiest black and white game. Dying is especially painful to watch in certain situations when you realize that this is a child that has just been offed in such a callous way. It fits with the nature of the game as the seemingly simple and innocence of a child searching for his sister takes such a harsh turn making for a more dramatic experience sans the audible narrative.Taking about 4.9 hours on average to complete, the only true reason to keep playing Limbo is for achievements. I must add the achievements are far from being conventional as well as being far from easy making for a true challenge for achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s.Limbo is a game for a certain type of gamer. A gamer that enjoys a good challenge in a game rather than having it be overtly difficult, someone that appreciates a game that feels familiar to other games of the past, while not being a complete knock-off, and wants a taste of something new with a flavor that is still recognizable. For that reason, I can’t recommend that everyone needs to play this game, but I do feel that people should play this game. If anything, this game is one of those refreshing breaths of air that a gamer needs to take here and there to remind you that there are games that offer something different. My Rating: 9.1/10 "

Click on the comment button of the review for full review if you are looking from my profile. Also yes I finished it in 3 hours with 75% of the game I did it myself and the other 25% is when I could not solve it and had to use a walkthrough.. Enjoy!  LIMBO By: Playdead StudiosReleased: 2010Genre: Puzzle/PlatformerOfficial Website: http://playdead.com/ What is LIMBO? A logic solving platformer game where the live of the in game protagonist is upon depended on how fast you can solve the current area puzzle otherwise he will be crushed, bludgeon, shot and electrified to death within LIMBO's uniquely realized black and white world where danger is out to get you at every step of the way.Basically its a very hard platformer with minimalist story and a unique artstyle.  Option Menu Verdict: Below Bare MinimalVery Very Bare. All you get is one option for sound, the other two is just control but you can't rebind it and credit which is rather pointless in the option menu. Controls Verdict: GoodFor Keyboard User its Directional Pad for movement and CTRL to use stuff. And its non rebindable.For Controller user its whatever is it that is on display on the option menu since my controller hasn't arrived yet so I can't vouch for it but otherwise:The KB control is alright with no input lag and other such manner of defects and pretty much any mistakes can't be attributed to the control since one of the good things about this game is that the controls are polished.  Graphics Verdict: GreatGraphics are presented in a surreal black and white world but you can still see the background of the world most of the time. Neons glow brightly amidst the all consuming darkness. The game give me the horror game vibe with its industrial design and monotone colour scheme. Even the blood are black. Also despite being minimalist the death scene are still rather grisly to go through.Also the character eyes glow. Sound Verdict: -I will have to pass the sound without a score this time since it is purely ambient music made to carry the atmosphere as oppose to situational thing. The SFX when the chains rattle and platform grinding on gears is good though. Gameplay Eh not much to say here, it is a platformer game with a puzzle based elements. If you like those kind of games then get it since it has the added bonus of watching your character die horribly if you screw up. But oh well lemme just expand a bit.You go to an area and are presented with a puzzle that usually follows the theme of the background e.g.: The first puzzle is a bear trap since the theme is a forest. Upon completion you move on to the next area/theme/puzzle/deathtrap and repeat till you reach the ambigious ending which I shall attempt to provide an explanation below.Game is a bit short though. Conclusion And here we are again towards the end of another review this time for LIMBO. Would I recommend this platformer game with a surrealistic bi-tone world? Sure,sure I would. But I'won't recommend it if you are looking for story closure and long gameplay but for what its worth the length is perfect enough to not feel stale. Overall get this game if you like the looks of it. Or just wait for sale if you dislike the price.Scoring Methology:-S-Rank: excellent-A-Rank: very good-B-Rank: solid-C-Rank: satisfactory-D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: A-Rank.Credit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help! Resources: Stuck? Use this handy walkthrough with index so you won't spoil yourself.http://portforward.com/games/walkthroughs/Limbo/Theory About LIMBO ending [spoiler ahead]:You are in Hell. That would explain as to why you face those nightmarish construct and the world is in that shape. During the ending where you smashed the glass its a symbolic thing signifying that you have once again return to the world of the living, oh and that girl is your sister mourning over you.

LIMBO					* 8/10The Combination of Minimalism and Difficult platform gave birth to LIMBO.That line would be enough to describe this platform. Minimalism is some kind of philosophy in every aspect of this game, even before you buy it, the synopsis briefly reports you're down in Limbo because you're worried for your sister. That's all. Fine. As soon as you load the game you have nothing to set, no graphics, no keys, you just start the game waking up in limbo.There's no tutorial nor any explanation so you have to guess that the arrow keys move your character and CTRL is used to grab objects to pull or interact with buttons. The game won't explain anything at all but it's quite self explanatory as the purpose of the game is just to go on avoiding obstacles, solving riddles, and getting past traps and ""enemy entities"" you might encounter from time to time. And you will die. A lot. Because there are lots of traps and ricks, but there's no need for a tutorial as all riddles and obstacles are presented with a very balanced growing difficulty starting with simple puzzles and arriving to very tough and complicated riddles mixed with arcade sections giving a great challenge. Also, there's no save system, but an automatic and very frequent checkpoint system.Visual art is minimalistic as well. Very minimalistic indeed as everything is in black and white, and the ambient is made of grey scales but everything is drawn with a great artistic taste as there will be interesting backgrounds and great light slices giving occasional inspired landscapes.According to the game's minimalistic philosophy, music is almost non existent replaced by ambience effects or single notes played softly mixed with loud noises coming from dangers or props to emphasize the sensation of danger.+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. This is the soul and the point of the game: going ahead, get past the dangers, solve riddles and survive. Riddles and traps will provide a really great and entertaining incrasing challenge. MINIMALISM. The game is designed to be minimalistic under every aspect and this turned out being a  winning point for the game because you have to solve hard and difficult riddles with simple controls not to mention the inspired art conceived in plain black and white.---CONs--- MINIMALISM. Minimalism itself can be a turndown because I can understand the gameplay, but at least the devs could have made me choose the key bindings. I know besides arrows the only key you need is CTRL but maybe I want to choose and, more importantly, know about that key. Also the lack of music after hours of gaming is really missed.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840M/Intel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 "

												Haunting and chilling to its core, Limbo is an experience that's hard to pull yourself out of and even more difficult to forget. Without an ounce of exposition, no more of a story than the simple premise of a boy in search of his sister, and a completely monochromatic art design, Limbo creates a twisted and disturbing world through its thick atmosphere and exceptional sound design, drawing you inward even as every fiber of your being compels you to leave. At the same time, it sacrifices gameplay in favor of linear, understandable progression that only asks as much of you as to ensure you feel wholly responsible for what befalls your character.In this way Limbo is intentionally manipulative. Every shadow that crosses your path, every tree that seems to move when you aren't watching, and the pieces of the decrepit environment crumbling around you all serve to heighten your senses; to engross you in the experience and pull you deeper down the morbid rabbit hole, all the while keeping danger far enough out of your mind that you inevitably slip up. It's in these moments that Limbo is most effective, as it shocks you to attention as your character is decapitated, mutilated, drowned, and otherwise made to cease his existence, all the while never panning away from the horrors on screen. The brutality of these acts are sold home by how young your character is, his innocence seemingly being ripped out of him little by little as you continue to plunge into the madness that surrounds you, all in the hope you might one day find what you are looking for and see the light of day again.Limbo's discrepancies then arise in the way it goes about achieving the feeling vulnerability as you venture into the unknown, relying almost entirely on trial and error in its puzzle designs, largely removing logic from the equation. It works in keeping a brisk pace and not letting the player be bogged down by mechanics, but it makes the portions where you are actually required to solve a basic puzzle seem out of place; juxtaposed in and placed like odd road blocks, never quite holding up the player but still feeling like they don't quite belong.Though an imperfect experience, whatever qualms I had with Limbo were quickly swallowed up by its austere, macabre world that so deftly engulfed me with its incredible atmospheric design, leaving me chilled and in awe. Though Limbo itself might eventually fade from the limelight, its impact on indie development cannot go understated, forever having carved out its place in history at a time when a game such as it was all but destined to fail. I don't consider Limbo the masterpiece some do, but its a journey that I feel is all but a necessity to take; if not for the exceptionally imaginative experience itself, than for its significance in gaming as a whole.

												Limbo is a platformer developed by Playdead and their first game, it released in 2010. I played it back when it released, but I decided to give it another chance due to the release of their new game Inside. You play as a young boy, who has gone quite literally through the depths of hell to find his sister. You do this through solving puzzles, killing a few insects, and having more guts than most grown men. Limbo is a spectacular game. The game is a very basic platformer, with only a jump, activate, and move button. The keyboard controls, like for most platformers, just don’t work well with the kind of movement you do in this game. So I would highly advise playing this game with a controller, unless you hate yourself. As far as enemies go, they are really few and far between. You will encounter a few insects that you later interact with in the game. And you will also see other kids that are malicious towards you. I really enjoy the gameplay for most of the time. Only issue I have with it is that some of the puzzles are a bit too complicated, and require you to backtrack and find objects. This may sound normal for a platformer of it’s type, but some of the parts are extremely spread out. I know it sounds nitpicky, and it really is. Throughout the game you are just looking for your sister, so there is not much of a story. But when you come across the many open and industrial places, you can definitely infer that something is seriously screwed up about Limbo. I would also say this game is easily one of the most depressing games I have ever played, nothing good ever happens to the boy. And as I stated earlier, he really does go through hell to accomplish his goal. But I can’t really go into further details about this game’s story without spoiling many of the game’s great moments. The game graphically, while very simple, is quite simply amazing. It has incredible shaders and so much dark but intriguing imagery. It really is one of the prettiest games from an aesthetic standpoint, even if a lot of it is just darkness. The sound in this game is also fantastic. From the ambient sounds in the open moments to the noisy bits in the factory. It really is all around solid stuff, and reminds me a bit of Aphex Twin’s early works. I tried hard to find stuff I had issues with in the game. But there was really so little wrong with the game, it’s a true work of art. I would definitely recommend this game.			"

												Limbo is 2D puzzle platformer hailed as an artistic masterpiece for its black and white style. Solid objects are always pure black and the eerie backgrounds are beautiful tones of grey. You'll start in a deadly forest and work your way through even deadlier factories and sewers. Everything in the game is deadly, falling too far, crushed into a pile of goo, impaled on spikes, bear traps, mutilated by saw blades, giant spiders, horrifying insects and even shallow water. You will feel every death, the game will show the boy's body being torn apart and the white eyes turn to black. Then you'll restart from the last checkpoint. The restarting from the checkpoint feels like it takes a second too long for a game with so many deaths.The controls are simple, left and right to move, a jump button and an interact button. Sadly the up doubles as a jump button, which can sometimes result in deaths when using an analog stick. The other button is a use button that is good for pushing and pulling objects, which plays a big part in traversal (puzzle solving). The game makes use of physics and momentum, objects can fall, wheels will roll, crush and in later levels there is reverse gravity. Objects have buoyancy and will float, except for your character, making for water puzzles (traversal). One of the most unique elements to the game are the brain slugs that will force you to move forward with no stopping until they hit a light where you then turn around. That shows some out of the box creativity.You'll make it through the quick game if you just keep playing. There's nothing really that requires skill since this is puzzle solving. Its more like stand here, jump there, pull this, jump on that. Everything has been done before, but this just makes it look really good. For the explorers out there, you can find 10 or so eggs in the game that unlock a challenging secret level.Overall, its a good game that hangs its hat on its art style. I'm not sure if its worth $10 anymore, you can find it on sale.			"

												If a game could be called art, this would be one of the best examples. Going through a dark, unknown, threatening world (limbo), you are bound to die in order to learn from your mistakes and carry on. The game is as close to perfect as it can be. It's relatively short, engaging and beautiful. Every fragment of the game is different and introduces best puzzles I've ever seen in a platformer, involving nice physics environment and many, many traps which just yell to the player ""don't get used to patterns you know from other video games, and also this one!"". Procedural animations make controlling very smooth and pleasant, and the animations themselves disturbingly realistic. And after you beat the game, you still ask yourself questions. Is this Limbo? Who is the boy and why is he there? Why this? Why that? It's all up to your interpretation. Just go there and die... until you make it.			"

												It's atmospheric. It's dark. It's horrifying. And it's utterly disappointing. LIMBO is full of unfair deathtraps, puzzles with a single convoluted solution (that take progressively longer to figure out and to solve), and so much trial and error and dying that the gratuitous checkpoints still feel like they're not numerous enough.Frustrating puzzles. Shaky jump controls. Platforming that often requires perfect timing. Dark lighting that is more often a hindrance than a mood-setter. And if you want to check it out as an artsy game? Don't bother. There's so little story, the title tells you more about what's going on than the events within the game.Maybe this was the cool thing to do when this game was released. But for my recent playthrough, all I got was a pretentious art game where you'll spend most of your time dying terribly, redoing sections because you made one tiny misstep, and most often of all, referencing walkthroughs to figure out what the hell you're supposed to do.

												the Music! the Artstyle! the Level design! the Atmosphere!One of the few games i've ever replayed. I'm usually not a replay person, i only watch and play games and movies once, often regardless of how good they were, but it's just something about this game that have made me replay it 4 times. (2 times on ipad, that's why my playtime is only 4 hrs) It's like playing a really good artistic movie. Yet there are no cutscenes whatsoever, it's just the animations and presentation that makes it feel that way.I'm mostly impressed by the sound design and how it ties into the gameplay, if you're an audiophile this game is a must-experience. Really masterful composition by martin stig andersen, check out his other work as well! ""Rabbit at the airport"" is a great album that does really intresting things with sound.			"

												I made a long rant about why this game simply isn't a good game, but I deleted it for the sake of not seeming too ""angry"". The only reason this game received the accolades it did is because of it's visuals. Visuals that are fairly uncommon in the games industry, I'll give them that. That's it, and it's embarassing. It's the worst kind of glorified flash game. I will say that this game isn't worth the money at all. It's mind-boggling that a game like this got as popular as it did. The difference between this, and another similarly popular game called ""Braid"" is that Braid offers interesting and unique gameplay while this does nothing unique in the gameplay/puzzle department. I feel like I've played this game dozens of time in numerous flash games on the internet. The puzzles are hilariously uninspired. The story is nonexistent, relying too heavily on interpetations of a couple of setpieces in the game, including the ending. Most of the game actually doesn't need to be played in order to appreciate the boy's journey, and the ending. They could have cut this game down from a first-time playthrough of 4 hours to a first-run playthrough of 1 hour, leaving only the best puzzles, setpieces, scenes, and it would have been 10 times better. It could have been a touted as an artistic showpiece, rather than a game, and I would have been immensely more satisfied.I don't recommend you buy this. Watch someone do a speedrun on it on youtube, it'll be the same thing.0/5			"

The dark and uncanny LIMBO LIMBO is one of the best indie games I've ever played. It was first released for iOS and android and I got a copy for the latter. The best part of the game is that it doesn't consume your time with tutorials. The journey starts as the boy, our protagonist, wakes up in LIMBO, the game doesn't even tell you that you've to press Ctrl for actions. The dark black and white environment creates a really deep atmosphere with no music. The developer did a really fantastic job with sound effects. If you play the game with headphones on, it'll really sink you deep into the game and will make you love it straight away.The gore in the game is unexpected. Usually when there are young protagonists in a game, their deaths or damages are not usually shown in a gory way. But don't expect something like that on LIMBO. The boy will drown to death, stabbed to death, chopped up into liitle pieces and may get impaled by a Spider if you are unlucky.The game contains easter eggs too so observation is a required.Overall its a fantastic game with many a difficult puzzles, and the best part is it doesn't give you the slightest hint in most cases.10/10			"

												LIMBO is a decent puzzle platformer, uses a wide variety of mechanics throughout to challenge the player.however the game employs puzzled which require timing and that just serves to highlight the main flaw of this game:the movement.controls aren't nearly as tight as they should be, it feels like you're running underwater which ruined the game for me.

												A work of art AND a game. In your face, Ebert. If you enjoy things that are a bit different, give it a try. It's eery, haunting, and somehow beautiful all at once. It gets under your skin in a way that so few games really do, and it manages to connect the player with the character in an elegant way that would be difficult if not impossible in a more complex first person or 3d experience. I don't think it has much in the way of replayability, but if you get it on sale it's definitely worth every penny for the time you'll get out of it. If you don't like dark atmospheres or side-scrolling puzzlers, give it a miss.			"

												Let's begin this review with a spoiler.... 'YOUR GOING TO DIE!!!'Also let me next begin to decalre to all those that have played this game and have an opinion as to it's meaning, you are all WRONG!Sorry it had to be said, i'm merely trumping the hundreds of opinions circulating around as to the games true meaning with each one of them contradicting the opionions of the one before. So I thought i might as well get in on the act. It's understandable really why there are so many idea's floating around, as the game was purposefully designed to be vague. Other than the word 'Hotel', no other written or spoken word is mentioned in the entire game. The game and it's contributing story is entirely acted out in visuals and it's many, many, many death scenes. This has even led many gamers to dismiss that there is any hidden meaning at all behind this game and that it is just a game, but for those that have done a bit of research on the matter and watched some interviews, will no doubt soon discover that the Lead Developer behind this game Jensen openly admits that there was a clear indistinct meaning behind all the inspirations discovered in the game and was kind of personally shocked how close the fans had got to that original concept. He has never admitted openly that anyone has it correct and now with all the millions of guess framework layed out, it is very unlikely that he will ever do so, as that is a further added attraction to the game.So let me personally dispell a few of the erroneous down right wrong idea's floating around and give you some more things to think about. Personally I don't think this information will ruin anything, but rather enhance the beauty of this game for you.The biggest clue to the game is it's title 'LIMBO'. Limbo is a doctrinal place made up by the Catholic Church. There is no mention of it in the Bible, yet there are many rules about it as set out by the Churches traditional theology. Basically in a nutshell it is a waiting place which some people go to before they are called into Heaven or Hell.The other things that you need to keep in mind is that there are several different Limbo's. There is the Limbo of the patriarchs (Abraham, Moses etc) and Limbo of Infants. This game's main character is a young un-named boy who for the purpose of this review we will call him 'Mr Bright Eyes' and his sister. There are several other children in this Limbo too. So evidently common sense dictates that we are in the Limbo for infants.Do all children go to Limbo? No... Only those that are not baptised. Evidently Mr Bright Eyes and his sister, neither of them are baptised. You also have to be dead to enter into Limbo, comatose states do not count as Limbo.The next big clue about this game is when it was released which was in 2010. For several years just prior to this there was quite a lot of hot debate as to the teaching of this doctrine and the need of some clarification on it. One of the biggest questions raised which caused a great ruckus was if it was possible to be 'tested' while in Limbo?Eventually after many arguements back and forth it was determined that it was possible to be tested within Limbo and from there your fate could be further decided. Let me give you a hypothetical situation where testing in Limbo might be required....There is a young boy who for one reason or another gets angry and pushes his sister out of a tree house the fall which basically nearly kills her/ or does in fact kill her. He then feels remorse for what he has done and goes off to find help. On his way he is bitten by a poisonous spider. As the kid continues in his frantic search for help, the poison rushes through his system and kills him before he is able to get any help. In this following hypothetical situation the boy would be tested in Limbo as to his sincerity.Sounds an awful lot like the game doesn't it...One more thing you need to keep in mind about Limbo is that two people can have a completely different experience in exactly the same place, at exactly the same time. For instance a Cruel boy in Limbo will not have the same experience as a sweet girl does have in Limbo. The Catholic church has never really defined how this is possible other than stating that there must be some type of 'barriers' in Limbo. So while Mr Bright Eyes gets to play with saw blades and brain bugs, his sister gets to play with butterflies and all things sweet. Therefore any crashing at the end of the game could be attributed to breaking through that barrier which seperates a good kid from a bad kid. Since both brother and sister are in Limbo they are both dead, but which one died first? It seems little sis did. He is aware of her and where she is and is looking for her evidently he already knows she is dead, while on the contrary little sis has no idea that her brother is in limbo too and is startled when she eventually finds this out. It is a bittersweet game from start to finish and though it only takes 55 minutes in a perfect run or thereabouts, with the constant deaths and respawn system you will be at it for days. As you journey through it, concentrated on the backgrounds and the places that you are and think about the hidden meaning. It is quite fun to do so. Did Mr Bright Eyes get out of limbo and enter heaven. Well it all depends on how much money his parents gave to the church though. Maybe we will find out in Limbo 2... "

												Review for Inside: Here.By now you've probably heard about the highly renowned platformer Limbo. The game has won a bucket full of awards since its release, and rightfully so. Artistically, it was one of the pioneers of the black and white, minimalistic silhouette design; it went on to inspire a plethora of copycats. Though often duplicated, the experience that comes from playing Limbo is one that's unique, and it could never be duplicated even if one tried hard. Originally launching in 2010 for most platforms, the title found its way on to steam in the middle of 2011. There's no real outward story to speak of, but rather a series of events that the developer, Playdead, have left gamers to interpret for themselves. A small boy wakes up in a new, unforgiving, and sometimes treacherous land, but it soon becomes apparent that he's chasing after someone. The landscape begins as a forest, laden in thick fog, but later turns into a crumbling city. You may think that at some point you'll come across even the tiniest spark of color, but alas all is gloom here. Be prepared to meet some characters that are like you, stuck in the void as they bombard you with obstacles, but most that you meet will be dead; ususally by apparent suicide.The world of Limbo is filled with platforming puzzles and hazardous traps that will undoubtedly keep you on your toes. While taking in the haunting scenery, you may find yourself victim to stepping on a well hidden bear trap, or not quite making a precision jump that ends with you landing on a bed of spikes. Maybe you think you need to push a box further into the water, only to find out that you cannot swim, and subsequently you drown. Death will come many times over for you, though favorably the checkpoints in this sinister land are forgiving. Much like its aesthetic design, the controls are also simple; you can jump, walk, climb, and move some items.Truly a haunting, gloomy, and at times depressive experience, Limbo is an amazing platformer. Even those like myself that may not be enthusiasts on the genre will find themselves enjoying this bleak adventure. There's no tutorial, given the simple design of the game. There's no text, the world and its events are left up to your perception and imagination. Despite the lack of narrated story, the game stands strong and immersive. It's one title that you won't forget for years to come. Highly recommended for platformer lovers, enjoyers of the bleak and depressive, and those seeking an unforgettable event.Rating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.𐌕𐋏𐌄 𐋏𐍈𐍂𐍂𐍈𐍂 𐌽𐌄𐌕𐤔𐍈𐍂𐌊 Curator | Group 𐌂𐌋𐌆𐌂𐌊 𐌅𐍈𐍂 𐌾𐍈𐍂𐌄			"

												Such a beautiful game, with sad and haunting imagery… It delights you and horrifies you in equal portions. The game is clever and challenging, and the puzzles are just the right level of complicated; not too easy so as to be boring, but not so hard that I give up! There is no soundtrack per se, but the music is very ambient, and at times it will fill you with almost a sense of dread (oh no, what now…) Also, it will often clue you in on how to time your actions, which may help... or not…  Because you WILL die… a lot… in the most gruesome ways imaginable… (There is actually an achievement to be earned for playing through the entire game and dying five or less times, I cannot see that happening for me, ever!)Buy it, for you cannot miss out playing through such an atmospheric game… ÜPS: For those of you lucky enough NOT to be playing on a Mac, I highly recommend INSIDE by the same developers after finishing LIMBO, it is apparently even more eerie and challenging... (and please please please Playdead, make it available to Mac users too, like you did with LIMBO?)			"

												When coming to review Limbo, I was surprised to see that my full completion time of the game was only 5.1 hours. I say this, because the game is so incredibly absorbing that it feels like I've spent a wonderful age in that little black and white world.The game has you play as a lost little guy, trying to save the day, while pretty much everything is trying to kill you.The style of the game is what sets it apart against other indie games, the wonderful noire-esque artisty which is so easily parodied. It's awesome. The puzzles are of an appropriate level too. I've heard complaints that some were too hard, which forced people to give up. I agree, some were a bit tricky, and I had to close the game for a few hours to work it out, but I don't see that as a problem. If a game can confuse you that much, and make you reflect on it, that is a success.Everything about the game is brilliant. Highly recommended.-Nilesy			"

												Disappointment. That's what I feel after playing this game. I wanted to like it so much and it has a lot of potential and appealing aspects, but looking beyond the amazing atmosphere of a black and white platformer and there's only disappointment.I expected a fun puzzle game that provided a good challenge, but instead it's a do-everything-at-the-perfect-time-or-you-fail-while-being-timed-already type of game where every task feels trivial and doesn't give you with a sense of achieving anything. The puzzles aren't even difficult, simply tedious, and after completing one and moving on to the next there's no feeling of excitement to overcome the challenge of the game but rather dread that the next puzzle is going to take even longer to get the timing right. And the one after that even longer. And the one after that even longer.I was hoping for some sense of a story, for some feeling that accompanied the atmosphere and haunting connection of being in LIMBO, but it's simply not there. And the lack of any sense of this makes everything you do in the game feel like you are mindlessly completing poorly designed puzzles. Not to mention the physics in the game can be a bit questionable and the controls have issues with response, and you're only getting more tedious things to deal with to make the challenge of the game.Unless you are passionate about this genre, I can't even suggest picking it up in a sale. It feels highly overhyped simply because of its atmosphere and potential.			"

												Limbo, the game, is special in that while it does not wholly depict that mysterious dimension as my mind did, it captures its essence. You are a boy who wakes up in a lonely world made up only of black, white, and shades of gray. Video game logic demands you walk from left to right, jumping over obstacles as they appear, a simple task that needs little attention in the initial moments. This is your chance to absorb your surroundings. The background provides an illusion of depth, but its branches and bridges are out of focus, as if you are dreaming them into existence. The pint-sized hero, his bright blinking eyes shining from his blackened silhouette, trots ahead with the charming gangliness of a six-year-old.You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.Then comes death. Limbo is a hostile place, home to giant spiders that would feast upon you, and traps apparently scattered by the world's other denizens. You step onto a claw trap, and it closes on your neck. Your head falls to the ground and wobbles just for a moment before lying still. No tears are shed, no music plays--the game provides no grand gesture to honor your demise. It simply happens, and you revive at the most recent checkpoint to try the puzzle again. Some of these deaths aren't outright fair; stepping on a pressure plate could mean certain death, but so could jumping over it. Such inconsistencies aren't common, but your first time in Limbo requires some trial-and-error experimentation. Loading times are short, and checkpoints are frequent, however, so death is rarely a frustration, though often a horror.What does it all mean? People pondered that question when Limbo was first released on the Xbox 360 in 2010, and the PC version adds nothing new that would illuminate the mystery of this world, so there's little reason to splurge on another version if you've already played. Nevertheless, the ending offers important clues to the greater plot, if not to the details of the game's events and objects--the imposing neon hotel sign that you must cross, for instance, or the murderous children, seemingly escaped from Lord of the Flies, that aim their blowguns at you. Limbo means for its atmosphere to consume you in the moment, and in that sense, it succeeds. You drag a dead child's corpse to solve a puzzle, and perhaps wonder if anyone grieves this lost soul given the apathy of the realm. You glimpse a figure and regard her with tenderness, but the brief glimmer of hope is snuffed out in an instant.After life, before death.It isn't until the final third of its two- to three-hour runtime that Limbo's puzzles become challenging. The first half of the game is more concerned with building dread and ambiguity. Even after being vanquished, a colossal spider's remaining leg thrusts at you from its thorax, one final act of defiance that could leave two corpses for the crows to pick. When you pull the leg from the spider, the audible cracks and visible white splatters emphasize just how recently its life force was crushed. Elsewhere, you push boxes and pull levers, rushing to finish the puzzle before the rising water fills the room. Failure means watching the dear boy go as limp as a ragdoll as liquid fills his lungs.The second half leaves behind the horrors in favor of puzzles involving gravity and complex machinery. As memorable as it is to navigate tilting rooms with only a few hanging lamps to light the way, it is that spider that most embodies Limbo's somber spirit. The later puzzles are complex and clever, but they don't haunt the heart. The finale feels abrupt because it returns to the first hour's imagery, having abandoned it for long enough to have altered your personal connection with the game from an emotional one to an intellectual one. And yet the end offers insight into a backstory left otherwise untouched--enough of it to inspire another playthrough, this time ever so much wiser than you were before.THE GOOD Striking atmosphere that chills the heart Excellent, poignant moments that stay with you Cold, gruesome deaths are presented with memorable and horrific apathy Introduces more involved puzzles at a satisfying paceTHE BAD The most haunting imagery is limited to the first half Ending doesn't emerge organically from the hour leading to it8/10GREAT			"

												Limbo started off as an experience. Similar to what you'd expect when seeing the trailer for it: an intriguing and relaxing theme of soft mystery through a peaceful environment. Distinctly stylistic, mostly lush and natural, industrial bits sometimes in moderation. Light puzzles are sprinkled in here and there. Nothing complex enough to ruin the experience or slow the progression.Then the puzzles get complex. Water puzzles. Gravity puzzles. Magnet puzzles. Speed puzzles. Timing puzzles. The only good thing I can say about them is it'll start you right back in front of the puzzle you failed instead of make you do an entire segment over like most games.LIMBO loses it's magic as the difficulty increases. It became just another puzzle game by the end. The lush relaxing environments largely became plain beam platforms and simple straight angle rooms. The magical relaxing nature disappeared because of the difficulty spike. The world's mystery theme vanishes entirely as though the story was only early bait made specifically for the trailer. I honestly feel a little let down. This game had a magical feel for half of it. Then the second half dropped that. I wouldn't be surprised if two different people designed separate halves of the game.			"

												Not much to say about this one.  It's a dark 2D platformer with physics puzzles often solved through trial and error, the error part usually being death.  The level designs are quite clever and indeed very atmospheric with the world being nothing but black and white silhouettes with fog, making it's design quite unique and memorable.  Though I didn't expect much from a $10 indie game, it only lasted about 3 hours, so it's hard to say whether or not I would reccomend it.  I certainly wouldn't say give it a pass either, it's really just up to you if you think $10 is worth a quick, atmospheric puzzle romp with giant saw blades.			"

												Really good atmosphere and general artstyle could make this game rise above the others. Unfortunately, I feel that when compared to other puzzle \ platformer games, visuals and sounds are really the only thing that Limbo does well.There are a few puzzles that are very smart and challenging, but most of the times you'll find the solution right away and you'll have to push some block or run very slowly to the solution. It's boring and irritating to have to spend so much time to solve a puzzle that you could have solved right away... and it's even more irritating to die while solving it, because you jumped a tenth of a second too early ( timing is really the essential skill in here) Other times I felt deaths were a little cheap, with objects that are virtually unavoidable on your first try, since you can't \ won't really see them hanging out in the darkness.Also, the story. This is very much a personal opinion (as the rest of the review, btw)  and I know plenty of people like open ended stories or having to fill in the spots. Still, this is way too much if you ask me. There are so many websites arguing about what this game means, and that's because nothing is explained at all. You wake up in a forest, run away from a spider, then other things, at some point from other humans, then machines, then you find a girl. And I know lots of hints can be gathered by visual imagery, yet these are the only elements that one can know for sure about the plot.Overall, this game is very short, unexplained and with a gameplay that can be both frustrating and boring. Yes, there are things to be loved here, but I'd suggest thinking twice before buying it (basically if you want something short, visually appealing and interesting, this might actually be for you)			"

												9.5/10 - Why such a high score for a game this simple? Because there is little to find wrong with it. Seriously. Sure, it might be on the short side, clocking in at just a couple 2 or 3 hours. But that is about it. For what it is, it is wonderful. In Limbo, you play the role of a boy, who is for the purpose of this game, nameless. You will pretty much go from left to right the entire game, with very little need to backtrack, and when you do, not very far. You will run through a macabre-like setting, that changes atmosphere as you progress the various settings. You will see a few people, but not many. You will see very few enemies period. The game just seems like you are in some hopeless kind of setting. and that is the whole point of Limbo. The gameplay is a mix of platforming, and environmental puzzles, seamlessly mixed together, without need for an inclined difficulty as you progress. Instead, it chooses to go for a more relaxed increase, and keep you focused instead on the atmosphere, rather than difficult situations. However, when die, is it ever satisfying! As grim as that sounds, it is indeed. Limbo has some wonderfully sadistic and amusing deaths for our young nameless protagonist. The animations for each are wonderfully extecuted, as the young boy is well...executed, so to speak. Visuals are entirely black and white, on purpose. But you do get wonderful shades of everything with the lack of color, and a nice film grain to really set the tone for the eerie environments you will find yourself pushing through. The audio is mostly ambient, with really no traditional music to speak of. Instead, it goes for acoustamatic music to set the tone. Everything basically has a purpose to pull you into the game. As for story, it is entirely left up to interpretation. But once you get to the ending, you will find yourself either scratching your head, or thinking up one of many possible explanations on what really happened. Either way, Limbo will leave you satisfied. Simply put: BUY THIS GAME!			"

Compelling, Poignant and Eerily Intuitive I don't know what's spookier, the B&W minimialistic ambiance, or the feeling that I've been to Limbo before. Probably in a childhood nightmare.This wondrous game is flawless and the aesthetic is primevally surreal.I'll only stop playing when I'm dead...or when I run out of achievements to work on.			"

												I think you will like this game if:1) You're a big fan of puzzle platformers2) You're a hardcore speedrunner3) You're an extreme sucker for noir and atmospheric stuffI dabble in all three of the above, but not enough to truly like this game, which I got for free and am glad that I did. Obviously I'm in the minority here, and I won't deny that Limbo does some things well. The environments are interesting, especially in the forest levels, and I quite liked the parts that have you fighting against giant spiders and strange children that seem right out of Lord of the Flies. The whole concept of a brave little boy stuck in some kind of shadowy world is a good one, and I like white noise, so the game's quite pleasant to listen to.But I just got bored. Once you're out of the forest the puzzles devolve into block pushing/physics manipulation sections, which have to be some of my least favorite game mechanics. Everything just drags and drags until it all abruptly ends, and the game relies on style to stick out in your mind way more than interesting gameplay. I can see why a lot of people like this, and I think it may have played better in 2010 when it first came out. But even back then you already had great puzzle platformers like Prince of Persia, Flashback, Another World and Heart of Darkness on the market, and I'd rather play any of those than Limbo again.

												LIMBO is a game that I first played upon its release in 2011, though I played it on my Xbox 360. Just a handful of years ago, I remember being very creeped out by the game's premise and dark world.However, after replaying the game just now, I find that it was not that exciting. It seems that I look at LIMBO and other games differently than some years ago. I thought that the minimalist story of the game back then was some magic answer, as if it was free of criticism - especially with the ending of the game. But that is not quite right. While the set-up of the game is definitely eerie, this time around I seemed to have wanted more. LIMBO definitely could have had more to it.The early part of the game gives you that weird feeling because there are other creatures and seemingly human beings in this place with you. But in the later part of the game, all of that vanishes, and it becomes nothing but boxes and water and saws and gravity. The disappearance of other life could have been done as a means to make you feel even worse about the place you are in, but it did not have such an effect. If anything, it just seems like the developers did not know what else to do with other life.Environment-wise, the game's appearance and sound fit the overall idea. In fact, music does not exist at all, and you only hear your footsteps and random objects clashing around here and there. Fitting for the ""dead"" world that you are helplessly navigating. Darkness. Fog. Minimal light. The visuals also fit that bad realm of LIMBO.While I am not necessarily saying that the game is bad, I was just not as impressed as I was when I first played it. I feel like the game is a one-time-go, and then it's not really good to return. I also think that it is easy for you to overrate it (as I did myself years ago), because of things like the black and white shadow artwork. People seem to just look at the game and because of the visuals, it is already pulling them in and ready to say that it is good.As LIMBO is a game, the gameplay itself is actually not that amazing. The game is literally die-and-repeat-until-you-win. Most of the puzzles have hidden obstacles or traps which are not easy to tell until you run through the first time. It may seem funny at first, but is actually not that amazing once you find out that a lot of the challenge is simply that. You have to repeat until you understand how to get around something.For instance (slight spoilers if you care about single-pass obstacles), one of the sillier examples is early in the game. You are running through an area and you see two sets of mini-platforms that look like buttons, each of which are sitting on top of panels and underneath giant weights. If you run onto the first panel, then the weight comes down and crushes you. So you must jump onto the mini-platform button, and then jump across to the regular floor again. Now, as you'll probably know where it's going from my context, the next panel and button are swapped. If you jump onto the second button, you get crushed again. So this time you must use the panel and jump over the button, avoiding it.The developers did the above example as a means to simply trick you easily and add a little artificial time to the game, as you'll have to repeat getting around it - but you only do so once. And that is very common in this game, with you having to die here and there until you are able to know what is ahead of you, and what you need to use to stop yourself from dying. That is not necessarily a good design, in my opinion. It would be alright to happen a little bit, but not as often as it really does.And you also have the amount of gameplay there is, which is very little. Despite having already played the game years ago, I did not really remember much of the puzzles and still died quite a bit. Even so, I was able to complete the game in about 2 hours or a bit less. There is not a tremendous amount of content in the game; and quite a few of the puzzles are meticulous in a bad way, meaning a good chunk of the 2 hours was repeating attempts to get past the same obstacles over and over.Sadly, I did not have that much enjoyment, excitement, or feeling of accomplishment playing through LIMBO. While I still intend to try out Playdead's INSIDE game, I do not see myself returning to this one.			"

												This game started of quite strong, but in the end fell short.It has a very beautiful style of using the contrast of black and white, and has some really interesting ideas.LIMBO was a game I really wanted a few years back as I saw a lot of great things said about the game. Well, then it became free for a while, and as I played it, well. I was disappointed.While I certanly didn't hate it and I would rather play this than many of the recent titles, I still did not manage to enjoy this to the fullest due to some simple things.The puzzles in this game are made to be simple, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as a matter of fact the puzzles were quite enjoyable. Instead of making the puzzles complex they made them simple, but still a little to think about. The puzzles are heavily reliant on timing for the most part and object placement, which I found to be great, but unfortunately there were a few flaws which made me really have an unenjoyable experience:Learning from your mistakes as you die was clearly the focus of this game, but only effectively used this at the start of the game and midway trough, as in for example at the beginning they had put a hardly visible trap on the ground, which of course killed you, but also clearly was meant to aid you, and the game delivered this message to the player quite fast making you use the trap in a creative way. But as I said, half the time this was not the case, and you would often find yourself dying in unfair circumstances, and all you will learn from them is to avoid them. This felt like a waste of time for me, and possibly many others.The biggest problem with this game though was with the controls and movement:First you get thrown into the game with no introduction, you just need to run and then drag a box under a platform. There is the first problem: I needed to spam my keyboards every single button until I found out the correct button to grab objects with. They did not bind this control to anything obvious like E or Shift, but instead to CTRL. A button rarely, possibly never used in any video game to do similar tasks. For many people it is very hard to move pinky to such location, and even for a person like me who uses this button to crouch in every game, it felt very slow compared to buttons they could have used, such as E.-Another problem with this is the fact that the only way to change the key binds is to go trough the game files to find the correct file in which you'll be able to tamper with controls. The game should have had some keyboard customization options at least.After this the game progresses nicely, but you'll encounter various places where you will have troubles with how the movement works. The first problem being the CTRL bind for grabbing, as you will need to use it a lot while trying to go trough challenging areas where slightest error would cause a death, but the placement of the key makes it frustrating at times. Secondly after climbing on top of a box you will not be able to jump for a brief amount, so you might end up spamming the jump key in a tight situation, and jump at a 0,2 second latency, making you unprepared for the late jump which leads to your death.If you think you can get past these, then by all means have a go with this game.

												For being such a simplistic little platformer as it is, it's a very good one with clever, dark and stunning atmosphere.I still remember the very day i tried a early version/demo of LIMBO way before its release where i spooked my pants in a tent outside of the Palads in Copenhagen.<( Spoilers )>As much as i liked it, i'm not to fond of the factory-industrial level design and feel near end and the all so sudden ending.

The game doesn't really have a story, it just throws you in.  You play a boy looking for his sister in a world that is odd and may be a dream (nightmare) but again the game doesn't tell you much.

												This game was just amazing. I want to give it 11/10, 6/5, A+/A, 110%/100% - just kidding, there is no such thing as 110% :-D Anyway, this game has everything a good arcade has to have: puzzles, tough places, no-end (for some people is pointless, for some is not, I personally think, that it had a very huge point) and also monsters ! I won't spoiler much for you, I just want to tell you this: if you want to try this game, buy it an play it, do NOT watch trailers. It will ruin the mood :-) Trust me, it will work better for you this way. So, if you're up for some challenge and some creepy dark acrade-style game, just go into Limbo. But beware - there is no escape from Limbo... or maybe it is ? You will have to find out on your own.			"

												A good friend of mine finished this with 100% achievements and wanted to see how I fared.  It had been sitting in my backlog for nearly 2 years, so why not.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  The style is something I've seen copied in a few other titles already. Shadowy and spooky, but not frightening or stressful. And the gameplay is extremely clever.  However, I have to say there is also a good deal of hidden bits that will end up killing you repeatedly.  Towards the end especially, I got quite stuck until I realized some parts I thought were scenery were really part of the game.  Puzzles vary from hard to solve, hard to platform, hard to time well, and hard to sequence.  It never coddled me or left me too far in the dark, though.  It was tough when it needed to be and a definte challenge to see through to the end. You will die a hundred deaths and swear, but once you solve a level it is a very satisfying feeling. I still need to unlock the secret level, though.			"

												It's difficult to sum this up in one sentence but I will try: it attempts, and does a good job at, drawing your primal fears.Darkness.Big creepy crawlies.Unknown.Tight spaces.Death.LIMBO is a minimalistic, 2D puzzle platformer, in which you control a nameless boy through environments which are, to put it lightly, hazardous. There is no exposition, no dialogue and very little information; the story is left up to you to piece it together. The title of the game, oppressive atmosphere and the little girl at the end should give an idea of what you're going through.The art style is minimal, with absolutely no colour whatsoever. For the most part you can distinguish items you can interact with. Key word is ""most"".Even the sound design is minimal, yet impeccable. Headphones ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED.Controls are the bare essentials: jump and climb on ropes or ladders, move left and right, drop or descend from ropes or ladders, and a general interaction button with which you can push or pull items, or trigger mechanisms. It's physics based, so momentum and angle are taken into account when traversing terrain, as well as how fast or heavy things must be to kill you, and you will die a lot. No wonder the devs called it ""trial and death"".My playthrough, which was completing the main levels, took around 2 hours, but several achievements reward exploration in certain areas, and there might be a hidden level I've missed, so that's probably going to bring the playtime up a bit.The regular price tag makes it a bit difficult to justify the purchase, as although it is an experience, it doesn't offer enough longevity I feel. Grab it on sale, or for free until the special offer ends.			"

												This is a short, atmospheric game that takes 3-4 hours to beat. However, its unique, evil/melancholy feel makes it an absolutely worthwhile game. The dark atmosphere is haunting and cool, and the gameplay is well paced. It is not an especially challenging game but you will die a fair amount. For those interested, this game is all basic puzzle solving; the only controls are movement, jump, and an action/interact button. There is no combat.Pros:+Unique and awesome scary atmosphere+Simple but entertaining puzzles+Not hard, but not so easy it's boring. Good difficulty imo.Cons:-Game only lasts 3-4 hoursFor the squeamish, you do see a child die in gruesome ways; but since he is just a cartoony silhouette, it's not all that violent.This game is a no-brainer on sale, and it's probably worth the full $10 too. It's a memorable experience.			"

												I downloaded the demo a few year's ago on the Xbox 360 and I remember loving the idea of being given no direction and having to figure everything out right from the beginning. So when I saw it on sale, I knew I had to buy it on Steam. What's neat about the game is that it progressively gets more elaborate and difficult. So while you start out by moving things to new places, without giving anything away, by the end of the game you have to be a master in timing.Be warned, this game is impossible to beat without dying 654894651684 times. Trust me I counted. But seriously, if you hate dying a million times trying to figure something out or are easily frustrated, you should probably stay away.In conclusion, if you like to figure things out without any hints or tips, then check this game out. I enjoyed it quite a bit and while I passed it in a relatively short period of time, I am looking forward to going back and getting some of the achievements and hopefully dying a lot less.-VR			"

												Limbo is an absolutely incredible game in what it does.  Although it can be completed in just a few hours of playing it is easily worth its price tag.  The puzzles are challenging, though not overly so and the game tells its story through its environment instead of dialogue.  I strongly recommend this game even though I generally get bored quickly with puzzle games.			"

												Short and sweet, but I like that about this game.  Limbo takes platforming into a dark, depressing and desperate world and does not lighten up one bit.The ""story"" was very emotional for me.  Enough questions are left unanswered to allow the player to come to his/her own conclusion, which can be tough to do but pays off well here.The controls are simple and balanced.  The game doesn't find its natch by sending volleys of flashy attacks and hordes of repetitive enemies at you like some plat-formers.  Instead, each encounter feels like a dream.  You do what you can to survive, but you are clearly not in control of your surroundings, and you feel as though your character truly doesn't belong in this place.The game also does not use an ""awesome sound track!"" to sell itself.  The game is quiet and eery -- dive into Limbo and see what feelings arise.Best bought on sale.


You!

Short version: 71%Limbo has a catchy art design and an interesting, depressing atmosphere. Sadly those are the only real selling points of this otherwise quite generic puzzle platformer.Long version:Limbo is all about style: a noir-like, minimalist, but nonetheless unique art style. If you wouldn’t mind staring at what you see in the preview screenshots for 2-4 hours, then Limbo will definitely be your game. And it knows how important first expressions are, because the initial atmosphere is superb, the eerie forest sets a very memorable tone.Still, it is mostly just a façade. A façade that hides a fairly generic puzzle platformer set in the most overused and tired settings for such games, a boring factory. A façade that tries to hide the fact that the game has no story: all you do is walk right and try to get past various obstacles that prevent you from walking right.As for puzzle mechanics, there are a few clever ones, like a parasite that makes you unable to stop moving in one direction (usually towards a pit), or some gravity manipulation. They are too rare though in the endless sea of uninspired box and switch puzzles. And they aren’t even difficult puzzles; the difficulty comes from trying to implement the easy solutions with incredibly tight timing and jumps. You’re gonna die. A lot. (©LordKat)If puzzle platformers are your thing, by all means, get it. Despite my musings, it is one of the better ones to come out in these years. Just don’t have too high expectations for it.			"

												A beautiful puzzle platformer. It is a truly breathtaking game, and has interesting puzzle elements which keeps the game entertaining all through until the end.Do not be fooled by a first look... Like they say, don't judge a book by it's cover. The game may look like your everyday ""atmospherical platformer"", but is in fact much more interesting and creative than it may originally seem. I was personally left speechless while I played it.The only letdown is the fact that the game is fairly short, and implementing a captivating storyline would have made it even better than it actually is, which is surprising bearing in mind that the game is already a nearly perfect work of atmospherical video game.Overall? Definitely worth it.			"

												This isn't a big game. 4-6 hours would be enough for you to beat it. However, I have to say the atmosphere of this game is awesome. Little music(sound effects maybe?) and black-and-white style make you feel fear from a cold and unknown world. Those elements describe the meaning of limbo  with silence and danger, which makes you into the game fast.Also, The controls are comfotable and easy. Puzzles aren't hard to solve. You will really love playing this game after you play for like 20 minutes.  I played and beat this game once because I couldn't stop playing it at all. It's well made and you would enjoy every progress you've made in the game.At last, It's fun to figure out the ending of the game. I highly suggest you first think about what you've done in this game from the beginning to the end and then google about others' opinions about the ending. Though, there would never be any correct answer:).			"

Well, I'm glad ytou asked.Without any instruction or mind numbing tutorials, the game explains to you how the world of Limbo works just by exploring (like in real life).If this game teaches us anything, it's that graphics don't always make a game as interesting to us humans as what a game does to our brains while we play it.With it's eerie Tim Burton-esque feel, and minimalistc look, this game comes off as spooOooOokily boooOooOotiful.You can bet I'll be playing this, alone and in the dark next Halloween.And for the time being, it's FREE on Steam!

Many times I know exactly what to do but I just can't make it. -puzzles, specially at the end are just way too hard, I don't enjoy failing 100 times doing the same puzzle. - The story is almost non existant: ""boy looking for his sis in limbo"" sums it up. -even if you are a perfect player, the game will kill you a lot.. there are just many surprises that will kill you unless you saw them in advance (in a youtube video or something).4/10			"

												LIMBO is a very atmospheric game that is both punishing and rewarding.LIMBO is not something you can just walk through without dying. You will die, and die, and die. You will die over and over again (unless you guide, then you cheater :P). However, you will learn from those death experiences and solve the different environmental puzzles and situations. LIMBO has a very nice saving system so that there is rarely ever a headbang rage moment. Some of the puzzles are actually quite difficult if you don't think outside the box and use all of the environment. The game is punishing if you are impatient and do not closely observe the environment. However, LIMBO truly has a good progression and none of the situations are hard beyond belief. The environment is also what makes the game so good, it is so well crafted and fits the atmosphere perfectly. The sounds and music also match the game very well.The only bad thing about LIMBO is that I hate the weak and short hops of this little boy. It's like he has never jumped before in his life and it is honestly the most insanely stupid short jump. Although this isn't really a big problem because that's the way the game is designed, it still annoyed me.Overall, very solid game that deserves to be played by all. There are very little if any cons to this game.Rating: 8.1/10Recommend Price: $6.49 or Lower			"

												A very mind-boggling puzzle game with amazingly setup puzzles, challenges, tricks, and more for you to explore. Each puzzle will leave you wondering how to solve it for a while, others will be simple and easy to solve halfway through, until you realize you've made a mistake somewhere along the line. Anything and everything could kill you, always leaving you hoping you solved the puzzle right. The save states are generous, but there are some very annoying timed puzzles near the end of the game. The visuals and art style are great, along with the level design, SFX, and music. I don't particularly like single player games, but this game is a must buy because of its cheap price, great design, and calming ambience.			"

												5/5A fantastic little, morbid adventure. Dark and gloomy. Vague and gorey. Clever and enraging. This is an artistic platform game that forces you to think outside the box--quite often, but every successful attempt is rewarding and leaves you feeling accomplished. This game touched me more than you might expect on an emotional level, too. I affectionately refer to the player as ""Billy"" because he doesn't really have a name. And he doesn't really talk. Or... anything, really. But that's part of the charm! It's a platform game with a delightful twist. It's kinda creepy and fun. Expect to die a lot but once you get that ""Aha!"" moment, it makes it all worth it. The checkpoints are also really handy and the game is merciless but not punishing, if that makes sense. A fun little adventure. 5/5 might seem like much but I'm rating it not based on what it is, but what it's trying to be. And it succeeds in its goal of being a clever, original platformer.			"

												Caveat:  Steam offered this program for free sometime during or around the last Steam Sale.  That's the only reason I have it.  It's a platformer, and, in general, I don't like platformers.  I don't like the time pressure the game puts on me at various locations.  I don't like the jump/miss/die/repeat activity to get through the puzzles.  I don't like the ""discovery by death"" methodology used in the puzzles.But, realizing that those are personal preferences, I've got to admit that from a technical perspective, it's a well done game.  The visuals, though basically a shadow-play, are all good, the controls (once you figure them out) are simple, and the checkpoints are close enough that the constant dying isn't too onerous.  At a technical level, my only real issue is that there's no explanation for why everything and everyone in the game is trying to kill the player.It took me 6.3 hours to play the game with all Achievements except for the final big one (play it through in one setting with 5 or fewer deaths).  Since I don't like platformers, I doubt I'll ever try to get that last Achievement.  So, at my dollar an hour metric, I'd say anything below $6 would be a great price (and since I got it for free, I can't complain).  So, I'm recommending it (with reservations).			"

-Quick Review-Limbo is what I would call a “Puzzle platform physics engine game”. The game has simple controls, but the puzzles do require some forethought. The game is priced normally at $9.99, I would personally recommend waiting until there was a sale on the game.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play the story as a silhouette character that is always seemingly running to the right in an attempt to get someplace. Game Play: Great puzzles, sometimes tricky timed jumps, sometimes morbid, the best word to describe this game is “fascinating”.Achievements: Many of the achievements are easy to get, most of them require stepping on little white orbs found throughout the game, but there are a few very tough achievements such as “No point in dying”. (…Which I am still working on, as of 02/12/14)Price: I’ve put 6 hours into the game, in my opinion that isn’t enough time to be worth $9.99 the game was on a humble bundle sale when I purchased it, so I’ve been very satisfied with the quality of the game.Conclusion: If you’re in the market for a short little platformer adventure and have a few hours to burn, this is a great game for you to play, however the price is too high to purchase normally			"

A Paladin's Review: Limbo. Dark and Moody Atmosphere in a Brutal World.Genre: 2D Puzzle Platformer.Developed & Published by: PlaydeadPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Consoles. Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Read the original review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsYou play as an unnamed, and apparently mute, boy searching through dark woods and city landscapes for something. According to the game description, you're looking for his sister. Oddly enough, there is no mention of this in the game though it's implied. There isn't much of a story in this game. You simply wake up in a forest, with no idea who you are or what's going on. In the background, you see trees and as you go along you start seeing buildings, plants and factories. It is almost as if your in a side world to the ""real world"" but the game never really explains this. The game has a distinct ending, but its a bit abrupt and isn't that satisfying to me. There isn't much to spoil about the ending of the game, but I won't spoil it so you'll have to play it to find out what happens.This story's character is no saint, to say the least. While one could make the claim that it was kill or be killed, he does some things that make me wonder. There are certain parts where the kid will kill the other kids via traps. There is also one point of the game where you have to pull a leg out of a spider that's been trying to kill you in order to progress further. Usually, you feel justified to an enemy, but ugh, doing that really made me queasy. PuzzlesSo what about the puzzles themselves? Well, they weren't too bad. They tended to range from jumping around, moving objects to the right place, using the physics engine and jumping at the right time, otherwise you were dead. It also includes some gravity puzzles as well as a part where an insect limits your movement. The overall difficulty curve is gentle and gradual for most of the time. None of the puzzles got to the point that required a ridiculous amount of precision in order to progress though. However, I did find some of the puzzles can be frustratingly opaque. I ran into a couple that required some help from guides. One other thing I should point out is that while the game auto-saves as you progress, there are a few puzzles that if you screw up, it sets you back a little bit more than I would like, which can lead to some frustration as you redo the steps over and over again until you get it right. PC Settings & Audio/VideoPC settings are fairly limited though you don't need many for 2D Games. You can change are controls and brightness levels. No V-Sync, AA, AF, resolution options or anything else. It's limited but to the game's credit, seems to scale well from my experience. I never had any lag or crashing or other issues crop up during gameplay. The game is very light on graphic settings, though your not going to really need to change them as long as you have a decent computer. It is controller compatible if you prefer controllers. The keybindings aren't changeable, but I found the default ones are smartly placed.The game's OST is very atmospheric. At first the music stays in the background, but as you progress along and get into the city-section, the music starts getting in your face, almost overwhelming you as you try and solve the puzzles all the way to the end of the game. The sounds itself sound very realistic, though sometimes muted. There is a flying insect in the game that slightly creeped me out thanks to the sound design. Final ThoughtsIn the end, I had more fun that I thought I would with this game. The unique visuals sets this game apart and makes it memorable, helped in no small part by how brutally dark this game is. It only clocks in at about three to fours hours for a run through it. But I was satisfied with the length of the game given how cheap it is and how well designed it is. There's a reason that a lot of games are based on the Limbo formula and why so many people played this title. It's worth giving a look for the moody atmosphere, the dark music and tight platforming.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												There is no reason to not recommend this game. This game is so great, so deep. There is so much told and so much more untold, even though you see no words or descriptions. Its meanings...I just can't elaborate in few words and to be honest I dare not to say I really fully understand all of it.I would however say the game has some part a bit too tricky and unpleasant in its relatively simple mechanisms. Some part of the tricks may present solved, you figured the idea. However you just won't beat it easily because the timing is so hard to control. Those part should be simplified and grant players more time to react. After all, solving the mechanisms rather than calculating the actions is the key of its purposes.			"

												This is a pretty short little game, maybe five hours at most, but I got it on sale and it was totally worth it.  Very fun, great atmosphere, and good physics puzzles.  My only complaint is that the scariest part is at the beginning.  I would've liked to have been afraid more after that, as the fear added a lot to the experience.  Without as much tension later on, it wasn't quite as compelling. Some of the later puzzles require precise timing as well, but most of them as solvable with thoughtful contemplation.			"

												LIMBO is a sidescrolling platformer with physics- and gravity-based puzzles and an unique visual art style.'Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters LIMBO' is the only thing that the store page says about the game. This single line is basically the whole story of the game and your one and only reason to go on.The puzzles are decent but not extraordinary brilliant or innovative. After all, it's the visual art style of the game that raised the interest among players.With roughly 2 hours of playtime, the game is extremely short for a game of this genre. On the other hand, it doesn't try to stretch the playtime by repeating the same puzzles over and over again.LIMBO certainly isn't a bad game, but if you are expecting a brilliant platformer with loads of playtime and replayability, then you might want to look somewhere else as this game most likely isn't for you.I'm not sure I would recommed it at its full price, but at 75% off during the major sales, it's certainly worth it.

												I have had Limbo in my gaming library for the longest of times, and I have always looked for the right time to bring it out of the darkness and into the light and start playing it through (analogy intended ;) . However I also wanted to wait and play Limbo the way I think this type of game was meant to be played, and that is with a controller on a big TV screen.I can't emphasise enough the importance of playing Limbo with a gaming controller. Now, not everyone has to agree with me on this, but if you are going to play this game, don't go at it on a ""small"" computer screen with a keyboard, its a little like playing FPS games with a ps/xbox controller, it just doesn't make the game proper justice. You have been warned.With that said, lets get on with the game L-I-M-B-O. And what a game it is. So well designed and directed, I am absolutley speechless. Limbo is not quite a platformer, and it's not quite a puzzle game, I could make it easy for myself and say it is a mix of both genres but... I would like to describe Limbo more as an immersive feeling, the game touches you without even a word being uttered throughout the whole game. Limbo takes you to places of lonelyness and war, a desolate place with trees and animals in a forest, there are gruesome deaths, machines and children, without any context and meaning, yet it all makes sense somehow.You, as a player, are totally commited to playing this through and through, and throughout the whole 4-5hours that I played, I never once got bored, only touched and amazed. The graphics and sounds mix seamleassly and completing one another in the most subtle ways and in what appears to be a minimalistic design, however such is not the case. Each section of the game has been carefully planned to the slightest detail, to mesh together seamlessly, hence the excellent minimalistic black and white design and the subtle sounds of the world of Limbo. Limbos art direction scales aways so much clutter and color and thus as a player your are solelyl left to focus only on the feeling- , exploring, and advancing the game.At this point you are probably wondering what the h**l is the game about, if you haven't heard or read about Limbo, I strongly suggest you youtube it and find some gameplay. Simply put, the game is the modern trendsetter for the puzzle/platformer games/genre, where its not about being able to jump over enemies and getting extra lives ala Super Mario Bros, but solving situations with the help your characters abilities, which is your brain, because the character, the little boy, himself, does not posses any abilities actually, outside of jumping and grabbing ledges. There is only one way to solve each problem, which is fine, and only once or twice did I have to youtube the solution to a problem. And for this review I would like to take the time to highlight one thing that probably most gamers never take into consideration, the game tester of Limbo that have done a tremendous job. This game is totally successfull because of game testers feedback has been right on point. Since in no part of the game do you really get stuck with a puzzle for too long, and this is 99% doing of the actual game testers. The testers have to understand what challenges each player faces and put their ""new player"" glasses on everytime they play the game. Don't get me wrong, the planning and direction and all that is the doing of the team, but where many puzzle games go wrong, is that you are at times lost of what to do next and how to do it, especially in this genre of games, but in Limbo, 99% of the time you know what to do intuitively or at least have a clue of what you are supposed to do, and what you can do to achieve the solution.  Final verdict: Get this game and start playing if you haven't dones so already, no questions asked, hands down (preferably on a controller ;) & Happy gaming!			"

												Good drinking game! Everytime you die, drink and hand controls over to someone else. (Also good sober.)Limbo is uncluttered with its greyscale 2D and basic mechanics, but it gets it right. Even the simple background sound is perfect for atmosphere and clues. Through good ol' trial and error you can think through the obstacles, and the solutions are logical, but challenging enough to get the mental gears spinning.If you have any amount of arachnophobia, brace yourself.

												Great indie puzzle platformer which moves at a very nice pace. You'll only spend roughly 2-4 hours playing this game, but it's definitely worth a go. The puzzles start very easy and become intuitive with slight increase in difficulty. The game requires a small amount of mechanical skill (jump timings, time coordinations, etc.) Progressing through the game rewards players with a nice sense of wit and accomplishment.The game can easily be played with a keyboard and includes a nice option to select different parts of your journey you can load in to. (This mechanic is nice for obtaining all the collectable achievments) There isn't much of a storyline. The game itself never mentions that the boy is searching for his sister (I only knew this due to the description). The game is dark, both figuratively and literally, giving a nice thematic to the title. Controls could be tighter, but really it's no big deal.8/10 :D			"

★★★★★A classic. Short, but perfect.It certainly got a lot of attention, including from other small-time developpers who try to bank on the same estetic style. In Limbo, it actually means something, as it conveys the horror that only comes across more effectively because of it.It also got the attention of my girlfriend, who normally dislikes games, but was blown away by Limbo and its predecessor INSIDE. The style, mystery and the gameplay just comes together in a perfect, harmonious, thought-out way.It might be somewhat expensive for some at a price of 10-15 bucks, but it's certainly worth 5 whole ones.

												If you like ambiance, artistic and atmospheric games, and can handle puzzle platforming challenges, you'll almost certainly like this. I almost never care about stuff like that - other games that people enjoy because of their ""atmosphere"" don't end up appealing to me if they don't have gameplay that I'm really interested in, but this game pulls it off so well that I have to say the atmosphere is one of the main reasons I like it. The puzzle platformer aspect is perfectly fine as well. It's nothing very complex, but it manages to avoid being repetitive and is constantly introducing new mechanics for you to work with. It has highs and lows of intensity, with more action-oriented segments and other more sit-and-think type segments, and it ends up having a nice flow of stimulation because of that. I've played plenty of puzzle platformers in my time and all I can say about the puzzles in this game is that they are decent and don't detract from the atmosphere.All of that said, unless it looks really appealing to you, it's not 10 dollars worth of entertainment. I got this for free during a sale, and that's probably the only way I would've played this game. You're paying 10 dollars for about 2-3 hours of entertainment, probably. I'm not saying that every game is only as valuable as its cost per hours ratio; this game certainly packs a lot of aesthetic and gameplay entertainment into that short time, but I just could never justify spending 10 dollars on it. If you're really into artistic games, though, you may find it to be worth it. Other than that, I would just recommend waiting for a really heavy discount. Definitely consider giving this a try at some point, though. I've played lots of games and this one is certainly unique.			"

												A limbo is a state of mind wherein a person is unable to escape his dream. The game presents a young boy in a limbo who embarks on a journey to reunite with his sister. The atmosphere has been perfected to a dark and grim theme and it stands true to the predicament that the boy finds himself in.A simple 2D platformer is combined with a simple control system. The real challenge is in figuring out ways of advancing the stage with a keen eye toward the environment. Besides, there exists death traps and monsters that wreck the poor boy to pieces and its absolutely gruesome when limbs tear apart (no pun intended).Ofcourse, frustration arises when you repeatedly die and fail to realize the way out. The game however feels relaxing when you need a break from other titles.Rated 9.5/10			"

												I've always heard of good things about Limbo, but it never piqued my interest enough to buy it until I got it from the HB Store. It's an atmospheric platformer with a minimalist approach to just about everything. When you start the game, you're just shown a little boy in the middle forest, and from there you take over. The main character can only move around, jump, and do certain actions if they're near certain objects such as pull a lever or press a button. There isn't much of a story and it's mostly left up to interpretation but I'm sure that was done on purpose. If there's one thing that I can truly appreciate about this game it's overall look of the game and the atmosphere it's able to give off. The devs did such a great job making you feel alone as you travel throughtout the game. They did a good job making me feel anxious and even scared as I went through some levels. HOWEVER this is game is far from a masterpiece, it isn't perfect. I was enjoying the game very much until the later half of the game when it changed its approach on level design. They start introducing new gimmicks such as gravity which really put a damper on the game for me personally. It wasn't difficult, but it didn't mesh well with what the game did so well in the first half.I got my enjoyment out of one playthrough which lasted me about 3.5 hours. I don't feel the need to go back for another playthrough unless I want to get the achievements or eventually forget how the scripted events go. I would recommend getting this on sale unless you are 100% positive that you will do multiple playthroughs for this game since the game is a bit on the short side for 10 dollars.			"

												Limbo ReviewFrom Wikipedia: ""In the theology of the Catholic Church, Limbo (Latin limbus, edge or boundary, referring to the ""edge"" of Hell) is a speculative idea about the afterlife condition of those who die in Original Sin without being assigned to the Hell of the Damned.""Are video games an art form? Limbo is one of those games that can answer such questions. It combines gloomy black and white visuals, low volume ambient soundtrack and chilling sound effects to produce an unforgettable experience that stays with you, much longer than it lasts. You are a young boy who wakes up in a forest, without knowing anything about your identity, where you are, where you come from or where you are going. You walk alone in the shadows, facing creatures and meeting other children along the way. The road ahead is tough and you must solve many puzzles, with the use of your brain and reflexes to keep going. There are no dialogs or cut scenes in this game, yet the storytelling is much greater than many other games. But there is death.  So much death. You will die many times in order to figure how to solve some puzzles or just to see the animation in every case. The puzzles start simple and they get more complex as you approach the ending. Oh, the ending! What an unusual way to end a game and spur so much debate over the meaning! Let’s just say, abrupt beginnings lead to abrupt endings… "

												The game is enjoyable plataformer with a particular art style and some puzzles. The only weak point is that it is too short (around 3 hours). I do not recommend pay full price for this game (since you can get similar and longer games for the same price).			"

												very awesome game! its puzzles are not very hard but quite interesting and most of the time you have to think for a while, to solve the puzzle not only requires your intellegence but also your action skills.What mostly impresses me is the black&white art style, that's really fresh and before this game i never found any other game had this style of image appearance. Besides, the physical effect is another thing i think it great that  no doubt has reached the level in most of 3D games. The design of every stage is fastinating, actually every stage is quite different from the other cuz  you'll never repeat the same thing you have done in last stage. Although the entire story of LIMBO is quite hard to understand but as long as you seize every detail of the process while you're playing this game,you'll find out its heart-touching meaning: a weak but brave and tough little boy, he set out his journey throughout the inferno world for the purpose of seeking his sister. the boy struggling in LIMBO maybe represents he's struggling under death line, but he finally meets his sister which means he comes back to life.The story is somehow meaningful and worth studying.

												I'll be honest, i was really hesitent going into this game. However, the deaper i delved into the mysterious and dark world of Limbo, i couldn't take my hands of this game. Its brilliant, yet simplistic art style is simply one of a kind, and fits perfectly with the secluded and lonely narrative. As far as indi-platformer type games go - Limbo's desirgners made sure to tick all the boxes. Charming at the start, they ram up the difficulty to a mind-numbing and teath-churning game, which has you stuck in wonder about what to do next. Difficult, but not impossible - this game heavily utilises sound and light to create spectacular black-and-white effects which add to the increadible feal of the game. 9/10 - Definately one of those games i look forward to replaying in the near future.

												Limbo - a unique game has received numerous awards when released in 2010 . Creepy dark atmosphere , the danger always lurking death , a boy on a journey to find his sister , all placed in the silent world only 2 black and white - in Limbo have something both haunting and charismatic players . In game, the little boy could easily be attacked at any time , can tell in the dark world where he is not known as a safety . You have to control a stylized technology refresh exceed those problems . As being parasitic worms on his body , you must do so crowd control worms he died . 2nd is dangerous mechanical traps, it can cut your boy easier,the trap is hidden away everywhere and just wrong for this little boy go an wrong step and everything will end there. If you get killed you'll have to return to a previous save location to start the journey. Along with that, the image of the boy's death is described vividly, as anti-stakes impaled, melted determine trap, where intelligent environment where everything ... The game's sound is sometimes very unusual chill, it will makes you startled sometime. Generally like all phatfom traditional game, the game spread storyline and difficulty challenge players as well as blue key to attract players. If you are a fan of horror game and platform game, you must play it.			"

												Summary: Cool game, the design is masterful and the lonely feeling of being stuck in limbo is really captured by the art style/sound effects. Highly recommend a play-through, I wish I got more time for indie games these days!Graphics: Stylistic, dark and beautiful. Nothing impressive in terms of super-power hollywood effects.Sounds: Great, reminds you that you are in stuck in limbo.Gameplay: May be difficult for newbs, not everything is so obvious and a guide may prove helpful in some places.

												I wanted to play this when it came out, but couldn't due to the fact that I don't have an Xbox360. Needless to say, I was thrilled when it finally came out on PC. For those that don't know, Limbo is a dark (literally and figuratively), eerie puzzle game masquerading as a platformer. You play as a boy who navigates through a series of creepy environments, trying to stay alive while solving lots of clever puzzles along the way. To say more would ruin the experience, so I'll just leave it at that. This is, simply put, one of those unbelievably unique games that MUST be played by anyone who believes that gaming can be an art form in addition to just being good old fashioned entertainment. The experience may last only a few hours, but it will stay with you a lifetime...			"

 Limbo  Child Death Simulator 2011-2016 What is it?  A dark and brutal 2D puzzle platforming game. Gameplay:  Puzzles are smart and rewarding but can be frustrating, they are very trial and error based. Often using physics very well. Story:  The story is not told via cutscenes or dialog, a lot of it is for you to figure out from the occurances and backgrounds of the game. Controls:  The controls can be rather annoying at times on the keyboard, but would probably play better with a controller. Aesthetic:  The style of this game is beautiful, the black and white colour palette is pleasing to look at and also adds to the dark, unknowing atmosphere of the game. Graphics:  The 2D art of this game still hold up today (in my eyes) and the background looks great too, making you feel even more alone. Running/Bugs:  The game is easy to run and i did not come across any glitches, framerate drops or really any broken parts of the game. Verdict:  If 2D trial and error puzzle platforming and child death is your thing, then you sould definitley pick up this indie release. The death scenes will definitley scare younger audiences. 7/10 For me it was too brutal but I still enjoyed the intellegent puzzles and aesthetic.			"

												Ok, this is a hard one. I believe it has a fantastic setting and atmosphere and that that is what makes LIMBO the game it is but the platformer gameplay was kind of satisfactory, with puzzle elements that are difficult enough to be enjoyable but not to the point of destroying your keyboard of rage. The soundtrack is nothing special too.Overhyped for me, but I can't really complain, since it was free.➡️️Final Rating: 6/10			"

												I dunno, maybe this just isn't my type of game, but I'd heard it was a good game, so I gave it a shot.If I had to give it a genre, it would be puzzle platformer, but it isn't good at either.  I felt the controls were laggy, and unresponsive, and the puzzles were lacking.  There were three types of puzzles: 1.The type of puzzle where you need to die in order to figure out what you need to do  2.the type where you know where you need to get to, but you can't figure out how  3. the type where you know exactly how to solve the puzzle, but you just can't do it fast enoughNone of these three were interesting to me, and left me frustruated with the game.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was disappointed at the complete lack of story.  it gave me no incentive to keep playing, and I felt like quitting multiple times during the short 2 hour length.In my eyes, the only redeeming quality of the game is the art style if it's a type you like.  I'm personally not a fan, but I can see how some would like it.  The music was completely unmemorable.If you can get Limbo for really cheap or free, it might be worth a playthrough, but definitely not at full price.			"

												This side scrolling puzzler has you wonder though limbo attempting to survive the terrors that exist there from giant spiders, to enemies with blow dart and deadly circular saws and terrifyingly immense gears. This game is a wonderful challenge.  My only gripe would be the repetitive sounds when you are stuck in one part of the game. The chain on the rolling ladder will haunt me in my sleep tonight I know it. Some might think that the Black and white only graphics might take away from a game however the lack of colour seemed to add to the game even more. A masterpiece, I'd recommend it to anyone with a free afternoon. Some of the puzzles are a little tricky a not obvious at first but I found myself exploring the world more as a result. "

 Very atmospheric 2D platformer with smart but difficult puzzles  Limbo is a traditional popular dance contest that originated on the island of Trinidad. A horizontal bar, known as the limbo bar, is placed atop two vertical bars. All contestants must attempt to go under the bar with their backs facing the floor. Whoever knocks the bar off or falls is eliminated from the contest. After everyone has completed their turns, the bar is lowered slightly and the contest continues. The contest ends when only one person can successfully ""limbo"" under the bar. (SOURCE WIKIPDEDIA.ORG) And this is exactly how I felt during the game. Every new stage, every new puzzle is raising the difficutly, but motivates you equally to finally finish this classic of the artsy gaming genre. What I liked   Very deep atmosphere with great colour scheme in black, grey and white  Smart puzzles that feel so rewarding after completion  Fair set back points  Native 3D Vision support  Length of the game is perfect for one session the weekend or in the evening after work  Audio fits perfect the graphic style and listening to sounds is important to solve puzzles What I didn't like  Sometimes to difficult to solve without a walkthrough guide / do not feel embarrassed to use one  SPOILER:  the end is definitely not rewarding for all the trouble you have gone through A  2D platformer that was rated overwhelming postive throughout the industry and deserves the designation of ""classic"" . Every gamer should have taken a look at it. Highly recommended. Not for full price. But pick it up on sale (5 EUR would be fair)  "

There's something about those hanging bodies and the prospect of a giant spider ready and waiting to make a meal of Limbo Lad at any moment really makes this a timeless classic already.And the developers, gods that they are, made it free. If anyone hasn't gotten this game and played it yet, now you haven't a single excuse.TL;DR - Get it.			"

												Limbo, an amazing game with stunning design and atmosphere. With a mixture of adventure and puzzle, the game will catch you within a minute. There are no different difficulty settings, but the difficulty rises with higher levels. You will be dragged directly into the story without any information and no more informations are given while playing the game aswell, like a short-novel, but you will instantly try to figure out how to escape the mysterious and even more dangerous environment. You will be happy, if you solve a puzzle within the level and survive, but you can be afraid easily too while playing it. I was a bit surprised of the brutality in the game. Even in black and white you can easily feel the pain when you fail miserably and die one of several deaths. Be aware of the secrets and dangers, that are hidden in the dark. All in all one of the best Indie-games I played so far, but like the most titles kind of short.			"

												A simple platformer with an eerily beautiful art style: monochromatic like a slient black and white film, flickering and dark. I loved this game. The puzzles are nigh impossible to solve without dying first but watching the boy get splatter and then figuring out how not to die again is half the fun. There are no voice overs or any backstory - you just wake up in a field and try  to navigate a small lost boy out of the dark and macabre world he finds himself in. It has a great sense of loneliness and isolation. The lack of music adds to this feeling. I liked that you are thrown to the wolves in the begining of the game and left to figure what to do on your own. Too many games hold your hand and don't trust you to figure things out without some boring 15 minute tutorial. Like most platformers, I'd recommend playing this  with a controller as a keyboard doesn't do it justice.			"

Not only does it run on almost any machine and hardware setup, but it also delievers an unforgettable platforming experience. It's oozing with atmosphere, it features a film noir style, there is only indirect storytelling without any dialogues and the gameplay is very challenging. LIMBO is one of the best Indie games out there. A must have!			"

												A simple platformer with an eerily beautiful art style: monochromatic like a slient black and white film, flickering and dark. I loved this game. The puzzles are nigh impossible to solve without dying first but watching the boy get splatter and then figuring out how not to die again is half the fun. There are no voice overs or any backstory - you just wake up in a field and try  to navigate a small lost boy out of the dark and macabre world he finds himself in. It has a great sense of loneliness and isolation. The lack of music adds to this feeling. I liked that you are thrown to the wolves in the begining of the game and left to figure what to do on your own. Too many games hold your hand and don't trust you to figure things out without some boring 15 minute tutorial. Like most platformers, I'd recommend playing this  with a controller as a keyboard doesn't do it justice.			"

												This game is the reason I heard about steam and the rise of the indies for the first time ever. I saw a friend play part of it and I waited a few years to play it myself so that the experience would be new. The first half in the woods is absolutely brilliant, the mood, pacing and storytelling creates one of the best platforming puzzle solving experiences ever. It certainly makes the player fall instantly in love but the second half in mines and mechanical traps is more contrived and overall less fun. Still, get this beautiful mini-game when it's on sale! You can finish it in one sitting but there are a few secrets to find here and there for some extra replay value...PS: Controller is still not compatible on mac but you'll do fine without one.			"

												LIMBO is quite the game, the story being expositioned solely through gameplay. And oh boy, does the gameplay hold up. It's a 2D style platformer with abundant physics puzzles, which hit really close to home because I used to always play physics flash games. Anyways, another of the major selling points is the engrossing atmosphere, it being really well executed through soft sounds and a monochrome palette which goes easy on the eyes. Overall, I had a great time with the game and recommend it to anyone willing to pay a few bucks. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer, but I suppose dragging it out would reduce the level of quality.9.5/10			"

												One of the first games I think of when it comes to talking about indie gaming, it nails the stark and depressing feeling better than its many other stylistic imitators. Dark as can be, sometimes gruesome, it's a haunting journey that'll stick with you. While it's over pretty quickly, it is plenty challenging and has such a gloomy atmosphere that you might actually feel glad it's over when it is. A great example of how to tell a story without words, and how to use sound or lack thereof.			"

The atmosphere, the minimal music, the puzzles that actually get your mind working.  It was all done very well.  The visuals are mostly sillouhettes, but that's what makes it so appealing.  In a way, it reminds me of Nihilumbra and a few other gems I've played over the years and it's a great game.The controls and jumping take a little getting used to, but once you get it, you can timing your jumps properly for those gaps that need them.  Highly recommended!			"

I just wanted to or had to know what came next.It tells you a perfect but broken and silent story combined with amazing  visuals.If you want the full experience i suggest playing it in a ""Dark Room"" with Good speakers.

												The art style is very effective, the game drips with atmosphere and a rich world full of secrets and deeper meaning awaits those who want to explore it. The puzzles increase in difficulty as the game progresses but never become frustrating or stop being fun and the platforming is seemless. I don't like how the game can be trial and error at times, some traps require clairvoyance to be predicted the first time through and it makes some of your deaths seem really cheap, also the game could use more puzzle variety. Finally the game is only 2-3 hours long.9/10			"

												In terms of an eerie, unsettling atmosphere, LIMBO is fantastic. The puzzles too are nicely challenging and satisfying when you solve them. The achievements, too, reward the adventurous and patient player.The let down here is the game's unforgiving set-up. In terms of deaths, the game punishes you for being ignorant of things (traps etc) that you could not possibly have known until it's too late. The developers termed this ""trial and death"", but the extremely gruesome death sequences lose their impact after the nth unavoidable death on your first run through. This is especially prevalent in the second half, where the game loses a lot of the atmosphere and feel so beautifully constructed in the fist.I'd recommned LIMBO to anyone who enjoys the line between puzzle and platformer being toed, enjoys eerier, less ""obvious"" games, and above all, is extremely patient.

												LIMBO is not something to play for the gameplay. I find that it is more about the storyline. It has no words, no colors, no voices, just what you see and some pretty kickass music.

												Spiders, Nightmares and ConfusionA Review of LimboLimbo is a rare gem of a 2D puzzle game. One of those games you can pick up on a lazy, boring Sunday afternoon and get lost in. It has a lightweight story to go with the puzzles, but don't let that put you off if you're not looking to commit to a story in the next game you play. Not paying attention to it won't take anything away from the game, mostly because you'll be wondering how the ♥♥♥♥ to kill that spider.£6.99 may seem a little pricey for a game which can be completed in a short amount of time if you put your mind to it, but then again it's also a timeless classic of game that you can return to many times and still be surprised by. I don't know if it's the dark, misty landscape of the world, or the inevitable and somewhat distracting gory deaths (don't take the term gory death lightly), but every time I've revisited this game, I always find I've forgotten how to solve the more complex of the puzzles, a valuable characteristic for a game, as it lures you add yet more chunks of your day to the total game play time.The game's controls are very simple, arrow keys to move around; with the up key allowing you to jump and grab on to chains, or climb up the sides of crates. Crates play quite a vital part in solving puzzles and can be dragged around by holding control when next to them, but be warned, they are just as susceptible to large, spinning blades as your characters limbs are.Overall a brilliant game. I'm sure if you dug around for long enough you could find a problem with it, or an aspect which you don't like, but they most certainly aren't obvious which is enough reason for me not to go looking for things which would ruin an otherwise fantastic game. If £6.99 sounds like too much for you, give the steam demo a shot and see if you change your mind, and, well, if that doesn't help, maybe pick it up in the steam sales. "

												If you're looking for a very unique platformer, than this is the game to buy!The art style of the game is really what makes it unique, as the whole thing is eerie and dark, yet maintains an almost comical sense to it.  Although it may sound messed up, you'll find yourself laughing at your mistakes, which always seem to end in decapitation, obliteration or mutilation of some type.The game is short, it's very easily completed under 5 hours.  For this reason, I suggest waiting for it to be on sale or finding a coupon for it.  I understand that Limbo isn't meant to be some time consuming RPG, but it could have used a little more length.  Regardless, the gameplay that you will experience is nonetheless enjoyable, you'll just be left wanting more.8.5/10			"

												This game won the VGX Award for Best Independent Game in 2010 and the reason is obvious as soon as you start playing. This may be the most enjoyable immersion I have ever experienced in gaming. The use of silence is perfect, and whilst it's innovative for its year, it covers the traditional, subtle video-game learning curve in a very interesting way.Whether you're focused at it or not, eventually you get involved with the story (because there's a story being told) with the right amount of vagueness and beauty to make you think of theories of what really happened to the poor boy.In summary, a masterpiece. The only downside (and it's very minor) is the awkwardness in controls at certain points, which don't respond exactly like I was expecting them to and lead me to some frustration, specially when tackling the less-than-five-deaths achievement. Having said that, I had never felt so satisfied to get a 100% in achievements in my entire life. THAT S*** WAS BANANAS. Super hard.Anyway, try Limbo! Beautiful. 5/5			"

												This is an unusual game with elements of survival - horror.The game is in black and white, with lighting effects, film grain and a minimal amount of ambient sounds to create a tense atmosphere, which is often associated with the horror genre.The chapters are designed as abandoned misty place full of traps or simply abandoned neighborhoods of dangerous mechanisms, structures. With the death of the boy's body breaks into pieces! Sometimes found corpses and swarms of flies, hear sudden sounds that enhance the atmosphere of this wonderful game.10/10!			"

												I love good indie games. And this one is good. Indie games basicly live from an idea, from originality. Limbo is a game that proves it. Black & white graphics, horror themed forest, little guy in the middle of nowhere and going through lots of puzzles. That's original, I bet you can't name a game like that that's already on the market.Graphics are again black & white, that's cool, along with the ""vintage horror movie grain"" it really adds an awesome atmosphere. Details are presented also really well, grass, sparks, dust, everything like that. You can't really find something bad about it.Gameplay is simple, 5 keys only. No skill needed there. But it's a puzzle game, it makes you think. So in lots of cases, you need to worry about the timing and figuring out how are you gonna get past each section.In my opinion, a big factor in any kind of game is replay-ability. This game doesn't really offer you that. Although there's an achievement where you have to complete the game without dying more than 5 times. But it's fun to not play it for a couple of weeks, forget about all the solutions and playing it again.Overall, it's one of the best indie games I've ever seen, it's beautiful to look at even after figuring out all the puzzles. I'll give it 8,5/10.			"

												I love the look of the game.  The atmosphere is eerie and disquieting, nicely done.  Since I have a couple of fingers that are mangled after breaking them a few years ago, I found some of the timed actions in the game a bit difficult only because it killed my fumbling fingers.  Overall, a satisfying game though the ending is a bit abrupt.  Still, it has replay value to me because I loved the graphics in the game so much and found the levels challenging as the game progressed.			"

												This game won the VGX Award for Best Independent Game in 2010 and the reason is obvious as soon as you start playing. This may be the most enjoyable immersion I have ever experienced in gaming. The use of silence is perfect, and whilst it's innovative for its year, it covers the traditional, subtle video-game learning curve in a very interesting way.Whether you're focused at it or not, eventually you get involved with the story (because there's a story being told) with the right amount of vagueness and beauty to make you think of theories of what really happened to the poor boy.In summary, a masterpiece. The only downside (and it's very minor) is the awkwardness in controls at certain points, which don't respond exactly like I was expecting them to and lead me to some frustration, specially when tackling the less-than-five-deaths achievement. Having said that, I had never felt so satisfied to get a 100% in achievements in my entire life. THAT S*** WAS BANANAS. Super hard.Anyway, try Limbo! Beautiful. 5/5			"

												In terms of an eerie, unsettling atmosphere, LIMBO is fantastic. The puzzles too are nicely challenging and satisfying when you solve them. The achievements, too, reward the adventurous and patient player.The let down here is the game's unforgiving set-up. In terms of deaths, the game punishes you for being ignorant of things (traps etc) that you could not possibly have known until it's too late. The developers termed this ""trial and death"", but the extremely gruesome death sequences lose their impact after the nth unavoidable death on your first run through. This is especially prevalent in the second half, where the game loses a lot of the atmosphere and feel so beautifully constructed in the fist.I'd recommned LIMBO to anyone who enjoys the line between puzzle and platformer being toed, enjoys eerier, less ""obvious"" games, and above all, is extremely patient.

												LIMBO is not something to play for the gameplay. I find that it is more about the storyline. It has no words, no colors, no voices, just what you see and some pretty kickass music. The puzzles were challenging and the timing is nearly impossible to get right, but it gives you a good sense of satisfaction at the end.			"

												This game was infuriating in the sense that every single puzzle, while not being difficult to figure out, is entirely time-based. Even if you do find you are on the right track but are unable to execute the flawless manuevering, you fail it and have to start over. Best be ready with those action-button trigger-happy fingers. Also, I have yet to figure out what the story of this game is despite having played it through.			"

												It's a rare occasion for a game to present itself in such a unique way and accomplish so much by just letting the player figure it out.Minimalistic albeit very pleasent art style accompanied with satisfying gameplay mechanics that don't do anything revolutionary but manage to keep you fairly interested have left a really memorable experience. I'm not a huge fan of puzzles games mainly because I get frustrated if a puzzle is overly complicated and ridiculous. During my LIMBO playthrough, I never felt the need to check guidance for tutorials or instructions on how to 'beat' a certain puzzle. Puzzles despite not being very hard, still require a decent amount of perception regarding the stuff and objects around you. The game is relatively short, and it kinda ends abruptly, but it definitely is a terrific experience that I'd recommend to anyone. Rating: 7.5/10 TL;DR: Combining interesting mechanics, various puzzles and minimalistic but charming art style, LIMBO will entertain you for a solid few hours. "

												You know, I have a lot of indie platforming side scrolling games that I either buy on sale or in a bundle somewhere and I just never really get around to. However, I am very glad that I finally got to LIMBO.It's a surprisingly dark, depressing experience that is light on content and story, but there's just enough there to form your own opinions of what the game is about in your mind. The game is 100% puzzles and platforming but the difficulty is nearly perfect in my opinion. Not too obtuse, or too simple, I had to exercise my brain cells quite a bit. People may be disappointed by the small narrative component, but I actually feel like this helped add to the game's mystery, which is further enhanced by the noir, film-grainy, black and white aesthetic that just allows your own imagination to run wild.If Call of Duty is a big bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos with a two liter bottle of Mountain Dew, and the Witcher 3 is  a Five Course hearty meal paired with Hennessy on the rocks, I would say Limbo is one of those delectable, indulgent, dark chocolate truffle desserts. Bitter, dark, and small, but ultimately a satisfying and enjoyable experience that has deeper layers of flavor to consider.			"

												This game is an original masterpiece.  I was surprised, disgusted, drawn in, and found myself loving all of it.   The entire game is in black and white.  There is no music, only environmental sounds.  This silence coupled with the eerie atmosphere creates such a creepy, cautious feeling.  The puzzles are simple, clever, and dangerous.  Failure in some puzzles can create some twisted and sickening results.  The irony of an innocent-looking child lost within a dark and twisted and dangerous environment has never been crafted so beautifully as it has in LIMBO.  This one deserves two thumbs up.  I highly recommend it, but not to everyone.			"

IF your brain is compatible with 2D games and able to solve some logical puzzles using laws of physics, THEN go for it. If you want to see something new and meet new game climate, then go for it.I LOVE the ATMOSPHERE and the MINIMALISM. The game has many original ideas and contains both: easy and hard challenges. Creators did all things the right way in my opinion.How to enjoy this game? In my opinion you should simply install it, turn on your sound and play it without reading anything. The dark room without other people is best for it. If you fail passing the chapter, then close the game and re-try it next day.I do NOT recommend using any tutorials. I do NOT recommend watching Let's Plays BEFORE beating the game for the first time! It may destroy the whole experience!I did ~85% of the game and I really enjoyed the WHOLE time. I had NO problems with controls, graphics, etc. It was so much fun after all those repetitive 3D multi-player games with (quite often, unfortunately) toxic communities. IF you play ONLY the newest 3D AAAAA+ SLI/Crossfire games with colorful explosions covering the whole screen, then well... you may not find this game so much fun.If you cannot or do not want to use your brain, then well... find another game.If you want to T.K./troll other players during multiplayer, then... I hope it is the only game in your library...Is that game 5 years old? Well, is anything wrong with that if the game is OK? At least you get no new dumb reason to buy a new PC...I would like to thank creators for doing the giveaway. I enjoyed using their product.			"

Verdict: Heartily recommendedLIMBO: sidescrolling monochromatic atmospheric mind-stimulating multisyllable-evoking treasure of a game.Buy it. Play it. Chuckle at its simplicity. Continue playing. Watch horrified as your little illuminated eyes close at unexpected dismemberment. Curse it for its merciless deviousness. Play some more. Die some more. Marvel in disbelief at the previously missed subtle hints that made the seemingly impossible obstacle suddenly inexplicably logical and simple to surpass. How did I miss that?! Hear the eerie echo of your glee maniacal laughter die off against the walls as you watch yourself being squished like a bug after skipping ahead from the last obstacle. Scream. Play some more. Wait, why is it getting light already? Spend your work day mulling over the last fateful steps in your journey. Surprise your boss by finishing that project early just to get back to try your theory on how to beat that last obstacle. Die some more. Overcome some more. Oh my.... I.. I think I.. really... I won?!PositivesPrice point: worth the current €10. If you pay this money for a full-feature movie where you complain about how the main character is disposed of, you should get at least the same playtime out of this, probably more, with no one to blame but yourself for the multitude of ways your character bites the bullet.Interface: proof positive that a great game does not need a complicated interface, or really, much of an interface at all. All works exactly as expected or as discovered after a bit of trying. Nothing superfluous. Checkpoints are saved automatically after each main obstacle, which is all that's needed. The Thomas Edison Path-to-Success exemplified: succeed by finding 1001 ways to fail. Every gruesome death will teach you something (if only that you just repeated the same stupid mistake).

Even after all the achievements are done, you may find yourself wishing there was a next catacomb to explore, another monster to outrun, another trap to outwit.

												Limbo is a game in which the ""story"" is severely lacking. In the wake of Braid I remember quite of a bit of derision for how little there is plot-wise to this game. Regardless, as a game that coasts entirely on unique (for its time) art style and mood building, this is basically the perfect version of that game. It is a game that justifies style over substance by making that style brutal and dark. The puzzles are simple - you will have to die to complete some of them (this is partly the point), and if you want explanation that are explicit you won't get any. If you want an incredibly dark moody romp through a horror-scape forest, you'll get exactly what you're looking for. So - easy recommend at full price if you are looking for that , grab it on sale if you're just curious.			"

												Limbo, n, pl > Supposed region between heaven and hell.in Limbo > not knowing an outcome of something you are powerless  to influence. Limbo, n, pl > West Indies dance in which the dancers lean backwards to pass under a bar.Ok so this game has nothing to do with the latter meaning of this word, but this game would have to have been THE most enjoyable indie side scroller game ever for me... the dark, sinister & spooky environment is just perfect and the sound, which is of high quality, is perfect for full immersion... The game begins with you waking up and that's it... no tutorial, no story, no talking, no clue... the only thing you know ito do, is to go that way ----->But don't fret with the lack of instruction or story... it's absolutely PERFECT and with very simple controls that even my dead great granny can master...As you play, you constantly ask yourself...'What the #@!*% am I doing here???', 'how the #@!*% did I get here?', 'am I looking for something in particular?' and of course the most frequently asked question of all... 'WTF???'Don't be fooled by my recorded hours as an inexperience to review... i owned this game on xbox live from day one, I also bought a hard copy for PC 2 years ago and I just tried entering the code into steam two days ago and it worked... I have finished this game several times and including now as I write this review... It is a very short game, it only took me like 2 hours and 50 minutes, BUT... that's because I knew every puzzle, when you first play it, it should last for about 5-6 hours, anything less and you need to turn that difficulty up...The puzzles are magnificent, and you often find yourself over thinking and dying more...and when you finally solve it, you could totally b1tch slap yourself for not solving it sooner... This whole game was very well thought out, this game is definitely worth between $10-$15USD, just because the artwork, style, sound and gameplay are brilliant, for those that want value/replayability for your money, you should probably turn elsewhere or wait till this game is $5... This game is only for those REAL gamers that appreciate true art over the whole bang bang pow pow...I give this game a 9.5 out of 10, it loses half a point because I want MOOOOORRRREEEEEEALSO... I highly recommend playing this game completely stoned, coz you'll just trip out hard and you'll concentrate so much that you'll be unaware of the puddle of drool at your feet (I lean forward when i concentrate), it's even a good drinking game by yourself OR with your friends (The way I played it is when ever someone dies they hand over the controller....and everyone smashes down a SHOT of rum!!)

												The controls in this ONLY controls game make your character feel like he's running through water and has the agility of Godzilla (TOHO)  and almost all deaths are from trial and error traps (which is a meh thing ) or failing to do simple movements do to the sticky and sluggish controls (which is shameful)Game is a few hours long.

												Limbo means - (in some Christian beliefs) the supposed abode of the souls of unbaptized infants, and of the just who died before Christ's coming. So its about basically a kid who wants to save or find his sister. Guessing they died before birth? Idk. The music is interesting. Puzzles are very hard. Like literally. Cute game. 8/10 But the last achievement is a bit hard. Good luck.			"

Brought to you by the minds at Playdead, LIMBO is a bleak puzzle-platforming title that follows the bizarre trials of an unnamed adolescent as he journeys through perilous territories. Though the boy is simplistically presented, portraying no characteristics of audio cues, and the puzzles require much experimentation to achieve completion, the story it has to tell is engaging, as the protagonist perils through increasingly difficult struggles that occur subsequent to each other in a search for his lost sister.Here are a few items that I enjoyed about LIMBO:Gameplay - LIMBO holds a striking comparison to other Indie titles when it comes to the control layout: it is entirely straightforward. As you may or may not have experienced in prior games, this title utilizes the directional keys for basic movement-with down allowing your character to drop down and grab onto a ledge-, the Space Bar to jump, and the Control key to interact with objects and the environment itself; others have stated that this is much more fluid while playing with a plug-in controller. This painless layout aides the player in not forcing them to have to remember too many needless actions; if the controls could be remapped, a player could even be able to play it with one hand. In summary, the controls are of simple design for a simple game. As described previously-without revealing too much in terms of story progression-the player directs the young boy through treacherous territories, which prompts the solving of intricate puzzles. These stages-numbering twenty-four in total-generally require the player to test the mechanics in a ‘truth and error’ approach, unless applied thought is given to the situation for a considerable amount of time prior to action. A decent reaction time is necessary for certain portions since platforming is included into the general mechanics, which can be somewhat frustrating and rewarding due to the intense precision specific stages necessitate.Atmosphere - LIMBO is very black and white in terms of its color palette in that it is literally variants of black and white (if you have read my previous reviews, you know that I am not permitted to make jokes due to the overall lack of comedy involved, hence this current display.) This helps to depict the grim depth of this title’s occurrences, as well as developing tone that is not distracting from the gameplay. Even the game’s playstyle is murky since the protagonist’s death is intended to remind the player what they had done wrong in a specific segment and as an indication of how the level’s mechanics are set. The game shifts seamlessly between transition periods with minimal loading and intractable events. Hence the end of the game, which directly transfers into the beginning and causes the player to feel as though the protagonist’s ordeals are hopeless. Throughout, however, you may just become attached to said protagonist as though his struggles become your very own. The protagonist portrays no vocal characteristics, though the background effects add enough ambience to compensate for this.TL:DR - For those with keen senses in regards to game mechanics, you will find LIMBO to be trivial yet enjoyable. This title is a deep, brooding tale with no words and only atmosphere to speak its demented thoughts. It is a relatively short title that can be frustrating at times but is worth its cost as an experience. Though the protagonist does not and cannot outwardly portray his ideals, you will surely fight for him to learn of his sister’s fate. You will learn much as a player and an adventurer, but do not lose hope in LIMBO. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	.			"

												I'll start off by saying that this is one of my favourite games ever. Behind a rather linear 1,5 hour-long 2D puzzle platformer lies a masterpiece with a story of highly emotional background and astonishing aesthetics. I won't go into detail regarding the story, but the things that make this piece of art a game are solid. Gameplay mechanics are intuitive and sometimes provide a challenge (at least the first few playthroughs), the controls are fluid and responsive (I'd recommend a controller but keyboard will do just fine as well), visually the game looks very atmospheric and grim and the sound design lacks music, which is a good thing, since you're immersed by the cold-sounding ambience of the world of LIMBO. The game had many discounts already and you're likely to get this game for a single dollar. Get it. It's perfect. 10/10			"

												Maybe it's just me because this game gets so much praise for being so good but for 10 dollars I would not buy this game if  I had a second chance. There is the genre of fun puzzle games and then there is this game, it annoyed the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me in many parts with the dragging controls and the fact that you HAVE to use the arrow keys and are not even allowed to switch it to WASD really irritated me. You're thrown into the game with no heads up of what you're coming into (if you're like me and didn't do research on the game beforehand). this game probably the most unsatisfying game endings I've seen in a game that is not just out right free. I highly recommend buying this game while it is on sale for MUCH less then it normally is. The art style is great and the game looks really damn good overall but I just can't get into this game it was so annoying I got to a point where I just stopped trying to jump on the bandwagon and love this game and realized I am never going to enjoy this game. It just is not my style but for others I'm sure it's great.			"

												Limbo is a beautifully stylistic and well-made puzzle platformer. The silent and bleak atmosphere is expressed very well and the movement feels natural. It’s a very relaxing and ambient game, and However, I did have my problems with the game.GameplayLimbo is a puzzle platformer, but neither part was exceptional. The platforming is mostly bland, and, even with the introduction of new and interesting features, still seemed lacking for the most part. The main character is slow and cannot sprint, making getting from point to point tedious and boring, especially with the music-less bleak scenery and atmosphere. The puzzles themselves aren't that difficult, but they are tedious and require a lot of waiting usually. Waiting for the bolder to roll, waiting for the light to swing back, waiting for the platform to move, etc. Everything just moves so slow in this game. In addition, you die a lot. This isn't bad considering the theme and mood of the game, but its irritating in relation to the puzzles.  Although the respawn points are very generous with their frequency, the puzzles are slow and repeating the same puzzle multiple times can be frustrating. There’s a lot of auto scroll or waiting on things out of your control, and often can be failed in a simple mistake, making repeating the puzzle multiple times feel boring and unnecessary when you already know what to do. StoryThere’s not much of a story to this game, which is okay since the game is about Limbo, but for most of the game there isn't much drive to continue moving forward outside of finishing the game. The highlight of the game is the first third, where a giant spider is pursuing the character. This spider is threatening, brutal, and scary. It gives a lot of tension to the game, and really pushes the player forward to escape from it, but it is only present in the first third, and the rest of the game you are just wandering forward any real overarching threat or goal, and it just makes it less interesting. By no means is this a bad game. It’s a cheap, short, interesting game that does its unique aspects well, and I don’t regret taking the time to play through it, but at the same time I didn’t find anything really special about it that makes it stand out as a game other than its cool atmosphere and style. Is it worth the price, yeah? Did I find it that enjoyable, not really.			"

												All game developers stuck in a rut on how to make games should be locked away in a room and forced to play this game start to finish. Shouldn't take them more than a few hours and at the end of their session, the realization that it is possible to make a good, enjoyable game without always relying on ridiculous explosions, cliche chase sequences, dumb 'bro' side characters and more explosions. Sometimes, less really is more.So, should you buy this game? Well it is certainly not the most mind bending puzzle-platformer ever created, but if you like simple, enjoyable-yet-slightly-frustrating ambient games, then you really can't go wrong with Limbo. It's a decent buy for that loose $5 or so in your pocket. Now 'Add-to-Cart' and enjoy!			"

												A very atmospheric little platformer-puzzle game for those who enjoy games that focus on the storytelling and sinister atmosphere. Limbo is very short though, albeit I felt like it's a good thing, because it would become repetitive if it was longer. The only serious drawback is a lack of any challenge in the game, it's pretty easy even if you are inept in both platformers and puzzle games as I am. Nonetheless, I recommend it for a cheap price on a sale.			"

												Limbo is something different, not your usual platformer. It adds a unique approach and a distinctive style to the platformer genre and it uses a dark atmosphere to create an unsettling environment. The gameplay is simple and the progression is continuous not level oriented, one puzzle leading to the other. The checkpoint system is great and the game is very forgiving when you fail something and die, be it a jump, a timed event or something else. You are respawned very close to the spot you failed at. Did I like it? Yes. Do I recommend it? Yes. Should you try it? Probably. It's something different and the overall experience is nice. One thing I found interesting is that it has no story nor any spoken, written or interactive description of any sort. Basically you are thrown into the game and you must figure out what your next step is, what is your objective and what are your available options. The game doesn't hold your hand at all and everything you do, you do on your own. The puzzles are not difficult although their difficulty level slightly increases towards the end. You can beat the game in under 4 hours first time around without knowing anything about it.			"

												I'd say this is one of those games you either love or hate. Personally, I loved it. I can't, however, see any reason whatsoever to spend $10 on this game. It's dark and tricky but the length of gameplay kills the price tag. Steam has me registered with 111 minutes on Limbo. I'd say a good 30 minutes of that, if not more, was registered while I was paused, doing things around the house. When I got to the end, I figured I had just completed the first chapter. Nope, no more story. If you've played the demo and like it then wait for it to go on sale. I'd say $3 is reasonable but I can't in good conscience recommend you spend any more than that on it.			"

												What can I say about Limbo that has not already been said.  It Dark, disturbing at points, atmospheric, beautiful and enchanting.  It is easy to play but engaging at all times, presents puzzles to you but not obviously as a puzzle.  The main character is childlike but the world is harsh.  The story is subtle but evolves perfectly as the play and leaves you with questions.This game should not be remade, changed or even have a sequel. It stands on its own in many respects and just is.If it was £30 it should still be bought and played, just so that you can say you were there when it happened. I have been playing games since pong and there are many games that I am proud to be able to say I was part of at the time of their breakthrough.  Limbo is one such game.  So much so that I have ordered the special edition on Amazon, just because I want to be able to hand it to my children when the time is right. "

												Limbo is a puzzle platformer that will keep you on your toes until the very end as you regularly encounter unfamiliar obstacles.  The controls are minimal and the puzzles aren't terribly difficult to solve, making the game inviting for people of all ages.  The game is masterfully designed and animated.  From the very beginning you will feel immersed in the strange dark world of Limbo.  The story is not very long, and there is not much replayability unless you want to go for all of the achievements.  Keeping this in mind, Limbo remains one of the best indie games on the market.  I highly recommend adding it to your collection.			"

												LIMBO is an indie/adventure puzzle-platform video game, the first released title brought to us by the Danish developers Playdead. While the game itself was first released in July 2010 as an exclusive title on the Xbox Live Arcade, Playdead decided to re-release the game on other platforms after the Xbox exclusivity had ended. This meant that PS3 and PC players could get their hands on this amazing title after all. The developers never stopped there as they continued to release the game on other platforms such as OS X and Linux in 2012 and eventually even for the PS Vita and iOS in 2013. By continuously expanding the platforms this game can run on, the developers show us that they are proud of their first title and rightfully so.SettingsYou wake up as a nameless boy, who I named George, in the middle of a dark and eerily forest. There is no explanation to how this boy got here, nor what his tasks are, so the start of the journey leaves you with an infinite amount of questions. If you don’t feel sorry for this young boy at first, you will certainly feel more pity towards this adolescent adventurer as the story advances when he comes across human characters who would rather have him dead then be helpful or died of unexplainable reasons. Other creatures are also lurking in the forest, such as giant spiders who enjoy spiking this poor boy with their legs. The end has us bringing the boy to a girl, presumably his missing sister when the game abruptly ends leaving us with yet more questions.GameplaySince LIMBO is a 2D platform video game, you can only steer the boy left or right, jump up, climb on ledges and up or down ladders and ropes. There is also an action-button where you can push or pull objects which are mostly part of a puzzle. Those who find more joy by playing with controllers are in luck since the Xbox Controller works perfectly. The graphics are dark and grayscale to provide more depth in the scenery. The sounds are kept at minimal, which leaves you with a setting that is both stunning and alarming. If your spider-senses aren’t tingling with this game, you sure are one hell of a cold-blooded player. At some point you may find yourself laughing hysterically, if you are evil-kindred that is, when you hear the splash-sounds the game creates when you’ve killed a creature or unkind humans. Since you will not always understand what you need to do to solve a puzzle, numerous amounts of deaths is inevitable. These horrifying deaths are accompanied with gruesome sounds and images of the boy being dismembered or beheaded. As if the creepiness of the settings wasn’t enough to cause panic in my mind.Final conclusionOverall this game has left me amazed with the fact that such a simple design and story can leave me with such an eerie feeling. It may be an older game but I would certainly recommend it for any player who enjoys puzzles and platform games.This review can also be found on nearlyenoughdice.com "

												Over all I like this game, but I still have some mixed feelings about it. I'm not sure whether to recommend it or not because it completely depends on who the person. This game requires a LOT of patience as the puzzles become extremely challenging. There is much trial and error involved. I would sometimes spend a half hour trying to find a solution to a puzzle just to stumble into another one ten minutes later that stumped me. As you can imagine, I grew very frustrated. It did feel highly rewarding to over come each section and to finally figure it out, but there came a point where I just wanted to beat the game. There were a small handful of puzzles that I couldn't seem to figure out on my own no matter how hard I tried, and I was at the point where I was so eager to get it over with that I eventually looked up the solutions for a few of them. I hated to cheat, because there's no better feeling than figuring something out on your own, but I had just ran out of patience. And the demo, I felt, was very misleading. I was given the impression that it was all about platforming. There weren't any puzzles in it or at least, if there were, they were very benign and not noticeable. I get that games raise in difficulty, but the difficulty in puzzles had escalated to a shocking height to me. I will give it a lot of credit though. The puzzles are extraordinarily clever and well thought out. I haven't seen a game where the puzzles were designed so great, except for Portal. And maybe the problem lies in me. I have never enjoyed puzzles that much. I have a lot of patience in life, but not much in puzzles. You're also thrown right into the game, with no dialogue or spoken plot or cutscenes or instructions. For the most part, it's executed well, but I was upset to know that I had to actually look in the options menu at the controls to see that ctrl was the action button, mostly to pull and push things which is a large part in this game. I will still recommend this game, if only you are prepared for the difficulty. It looks to be a simple game, and the demo makes it out to be a simple game, but be prepared to invest more time into it than expected, to die a load more than expected, and possibly even to look up a guide when stuck.

												This game is possibly the most unique game I have ever played. The search for a fun, mind-working, and HD side scroller has been going on for me for a while now. Well the search has come to an end. This game makes you think but it has more than just that. While it is simply black and white, its really really HD and is super smooth. The fact that there is no music is absolutly the right way to go. It makes it seem that much more unique and really adds to the mystery aspect of the game. They tell you nothing at the beginning, not even the controls. You dont know who you are, where you are, OR what you are doing. And let me tell you...I've never been more entertained with such a lack of information in my life. BUY. THIS. GAME.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed Limbo. It starts out eerie, moves into creepy, then becomes downright disturbing before returning to simply eerie through a series of increasingly challenging platforming puzzles. Death is frequent and humorously macabre, but checkpoints are also frequent so it is not frustrating. Towards the end the puzzles require some precision timing and fast reflexes. The whole game takes about five hours to complete and you'll be tempted to do it in one sitting (appropriately, there's a Steam achievement for doing just that ... and for dying less than five times, which is decidely harder). Bottom line, this is an indie game that lives up to all its hype.			"

												First off, I highly recommend this game. It's unique.This review is about my thoughts about the story behind the game and it may inculde some spoilers so you might do not want to read my review if you haven't played and finished the game. Note that the creators of the game, did not give a clear answer to what really happened to that boy and his sister and they wanted us to make our own theories about it. There are a lot of theories and we cannot take one of them as the correct one. Here's what I believe.Let's begin from the title. Limbo. That's a place where, based on some religions, after people die in real life, their souls go there for an unspecific period of time until God judge them and decide if they deserve to go into heaven or hell. So, by the time that the boy is in the limbo, we clearly understand that he has died.As the game begins, he wakes up in the middle of a forest looking for her sister. The reason why he is doing that, is because he doesn't understand that he's dead and he believes that he has lost her sister, so she's searching for her. We don't know how he died, but it's possible that he fell from their treehouse because his sister is kneeling in the last scene and there's a rope ladder besides her. Each area of the game represents his life. Starts off in a mysterious forest with spiders being his fear that he tries to overcome. Next ""level"" is the school life with other kids who were bullying the homeless guy. He then had a traveling job, traveling and living in motels and hotels and getting to new places and he eventually end up working in a factory. I also believe that the light worms that stick to his head represent the community who wants to control his brain and make him unable to reach his final destination. You continue the game passing through many obstacles just like you do in real life before you reach your purpose.In the end, he eventually finds his ""missing"" sister and sees her kneeling. The scene is not clear enough, but I believe that she was crying about his death and praying for him. Her sister doesn't turn around to greet him but she feels the presence of his soul and that's why she somehow gets upset. In that moment, the boy finds out that he's dead as he approaches his sister and the game ends abruptly. As I already said, there are a lot of theories that we can imagine and seem to ""fit"", but we don't really know what happened. That's all I believe, even if my theory has some flaws (didn't mention the Glass part).			"

												This is a really cool game.  Black & white, no dialogue, but very atmospheric and reliant on sound effects and mood.  Its very very hard, getting all the achievements 90% memorization and 10% timing the skill.  Its just a simple 2d platformer with some cool concepts.  There is *no* replay value once you beat it though (except for doing a run with <5 deaths).  Try the demo & get it very cheap.			"

												LIMBO is one of those games you don't play when you're overly happy. However, it's an overall amazing game whose strength is in it's somber and brooding atmosphere and simplicity. While not very long, LIMBO makes for an amazing journey. An especially impressive feat given there is no dialogue of any sort.			"

 Pros  Gritty and dark atmosphere setting. A true platformer game where you will need a lot of trial, error and patience to complete it. The developer did a hella job to express their idea in grayscale, heavy filtered game. Cons The only thing I found disturbing is lack of texts and story to explain what you should do and why are you stranded here in the first place. With a good story it might be on par with Undertale's Cult. Conclusion Good game for puzzles lover, but I can't reccomend you to let your kids play it. The theme potrayed in this game are too dark. Other than that this game is a good game.			"

												A good puzzle-platformer with a even better atmosphere. For the first half its puzzles are more about observation and figuring out what to do.

Graphics/audio are also great, very atmospheric, really draws you in - the game made me jump a couple of times, probably because I'm a big scaredy cat lolLooking forward to a sequel or whatever else the developer is working on.

												This is a beautiful game. The art style and music set a mysterious and sinister ambience. The puzzles are nicely varied so the game never feels like a grind. It is divided into zones which morph so naturally that you won't notice until you're right in the next one. The transition to the underground and watching all the cogs and mahinery feel as if you're delving to the inner workings of Limbo. While the puzzles are a little too easy and you will only be stuck scratching your head a few times, they are fun and satisfying to complete. The mute boy you play as is surprisingly endearing. Despite receiving no hints as to who he is, you feel compelled to protect him in this dangerous world and help him to his final goal. You will feel the blow of every brutal death as if they were your own. This game is a wonderful journey and well worth checking out.			"

LIMBO is a fun little puzzle platformer that'll test your brains and your timing.The artstyle is incredible, an entirely greyscale noir feel that adds to occasional spooky and horrific elements. Controls are crisp and animation is fluid.There isn't a ""story"" in the traditional sense, but you can probably interpret it as an allegory for childhood, growing up, and how our fears change as we mature, if you're into that sort of thing.

												LIMBO is a 2D platformer taking place in the very dark environments of Limbo ; the ""speculative idea about the afterlife condition of those who die in original sin without being assigned to the Hell of the Damned"" Wikipedia says. The gameplay is pretty darn classic if you ask me. You can interact with some items like boxes, ropes, etc. in order to solve puzzles. What makes LIMBO such a great game is its graphical style and most importantly its atmosphere. Even though it is a 'die-and-retry', LIMBO will definitely make your heart go insane at times. First you have the musics, which aren't much diferent from one another, but they do so much on your immersion. Secondly, the game not giving you any kind of defense or way out sometimes, your conscience keeps the idea that you are very vulnerable. Another topic I want to aboard would be the story, which by any means is NOT inexistent. You can Google that and get some speculations and hypotheses on that. The players actually make their own interpretation of this game's story, and that's what makes this game so mysterious and questionable. LIMBO is one good enigma you HAVE to get your hands on.			"

												A short dark puzzle platformer that is left up to interpretation. A piece of modern gaming interpretive art. Pros--Simple mechanics easy to pick up-Dark tones catch me off guard at times -Extra levels and challenges for more hardcore puzzle players-Story left up to your imagination-Relaxing yet keeps you on guardCons--Very short at around 3 hours-Nothing groundbreaking in terms of gameplayThough some people will read too much into this game making up their own version of events and symbolism that was not unintentional as there is no definitive knowledge aside from a boy trying to find his sister as he is in limbo. A quiet and relaxing game with little to criticize as there isn't anything new or anything to tell from the story. It seems like an experimental way to use gaming as an art. Whether you think it is a masterpiece or a simple little experimental game is left entirely up to you to decide. Worth a play just to find how you interpret it.  "

												Over all I like this game, but I still have some mixed feelings about it. I'm not sure whether to recommend it or not because it completely depends on who the person. This game requires a LOT of patience as the puzzles become extremely challenging. There is much trial and error involved. I would sometimes spend a half hour trying to find a solution to a puzzle just to stumble into another one ten minutes later that stumped me. As you can imagine, I grew very frustrated. It did feel highly rewarding to over come each section and to finally figure it out, but there came a point where I just wanted to beat the game. There were a small handful of puzzles that I couldn't seem to figure out on my own no matter how hard I tried, and I was at the point where I was so eager to get it over with that I eventually looked up the solutions for a few of them. I hated to cheat, because there's no better feeling than figuring something out on your own, but I had just ran out of patience. And the demo, I felt, was very misleading. I was given the impression that it was all about platforming. There weren't any puzzles in it or at least, if there were, they were very benign and not noticeable. I get that games raise in difficulty, but the difficulty in puzzles had escalated to a shocking height to me. I will give it a lot of credit though. The puzzles are extraordinarily clever and well thought out. I haven't seen a game where the puzzles were designed so great, except for Portal. And maybe the problem lies in me. I have never enjoyed puzzles that much. I have a lot of patience in life, but not much in puzzles. You're also thrown right into the game, with no dialogue or spoken plot or cutscenes or instructions. For the most part, it's executed well, but I was upset to know that I had to actually look in the options menu at the controls to see that ctrl was the action button, mostly to pull and push things which is a large part in this game. I will still recommend this game, if only you are prepared for the difficulty. It looks to be a simple game, and the demo makes it out to be a simple game, but be prepared to invest more time into it than expected, to die a load more than expected, and possibly even to look up a guide when stuck.

												I'd say this is one of those games you either love or hate. Personally, I loved it. I can't, however, see any reason whatsoever to spend $10 on this game. It's dark and tricky but the length of gameplay kills the price tag. Steam has me registered with 111 minutes on Limbo. I'd say a good 30 minutes of that, if not more, was registered while I was paused, doing things around the house. When I got to the end, I figured I had just completed the first chapter. Nope, no more story. If you've played the demo and like it then wait for it to go on sale. I'd say $3 is reasonable but I can't in good conscience recommend you spend any more than that on it.			"

The sound design is mega intense, the puzzles are clever and the game gets more difficult than one would think, yet it remains very fair at every point!This game is best played alone at night with a headset on in one session.I think the best part is the discrepancy between the childlike papercut grafics, the innocent look of the boy and the brutal world around him. The shocking death traps, many of which can hardly be avoided on first try, gave me a chill!Pure awesomeness and a MUST PLAY!			"

REVIEW: LIMBOLimbo is one of those games I had heard of, but never really put on the to-do list. It was only thanks to the generosity of a friend on Steam that I gained a copy to try and complete. But I haven’t been a fan of platformer games for some time, so would I enjoy Limbo?In a mysterious, monochrome world, a boy awakens in a dark forest. He sets out in search of his sister. But in his way are the various denizens of this world, from giant spiders to parasitic worms, and even other kids…There are four words that sum up Limbo: dark, artistic, minimalistic, and frustrating. Easily, the best part of the game is the presentation. It’s dark and moody, the graphics are just right for the macabre style, and the whole atmosphere is enhanced by a dark and appropriate soundtrack. Music and sound effects contribute to an eerie and intimidating atmosphere. It’s like Silent Hill, but, if anything, even darker. While at first glance it appears to be a kid’s game, it is anything but. I dunno what the rating is, but parents, THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS. This is a violent and dark game. Bleakly beautiful and beautifully bleak, but definitely not for kids.The gameplay is another matter entirely. It is hard, even by the gold standard of Nintendo platformers. The gameplay consists of avoiding death and figuring out how to progress by trial and error, or as the publishers once called it, ‘trial and death’. And you will die. A lot. In manifold gruesome fashions. But figuring out how to get by the latest obstacles or adversaries will give you a feeling of accomplishment. Unfortunately, I tended to get more frustrated than feeling like I accomplished anything meaningful.The game comes across as the illegitimate offspring of Silent Hill and Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysey (which, incidentally, was recently re-released on Steam). While the difficulty feels right for such a game, I just wish it wasn’t quite so hard. And the payoff in the minimalist story doesn’t quite work.That being said, Limbo is pretty good. I like it mainly for the presentation more than the gameplay, but the gameplay itself has its own charms. It’s just a touch too hard for my liking…RATING: ***½  "

												One of the earlier games to mark the rise of the indie platformer trend, Limbo is a compelling oddity with one of the most striking and engrossing atmospheres in gaming.  Quite bleak and strangely disturbing, but underneath the layer of gloom lies clever puzzles and simple but highly addicting gameplay.  Highly recommended.			"

												LIMBO is a fantastic atmospheric puzzle game. It lives from its simple use of ambient light sources and its sound. It's not that hard to beat like other platform games for example Braid.LIMBO has an awesome and anti frustration auto save game mechanism, where you will never rage quit and still enjoy the game as if you haven't died.You will not get all achievements in your first run, but you have the option to load each chapter again to get 12 / 14 achievements very fast and easy. The achievement 'DING!' is much fun and challenging. The hardest achievement is 'No Point in Dying', but not impossible.If you like Indie games especially puzzle games without have a big story in the background, then this is a game for your library.Recommend!; when it's on sale!, because the main gameplay time is around 3 hours.

												Dark, atmospheric, and delightfully morbid at times. LIMBO is a fun little puzzle platformer that'll test your brains and your timing.The artstyle is incredible, an entirely greyscale noir feel that adds to occasional spooky and horrific elements. Controls are crisp and animation is fluid.There isn't a ""story"" in the traditional sense, but you can probably interpret it as an allegory for childhood, growing up, and how our fears change as we mature, if you're into that sort of thing.

												Limbo is an Inde Puzzle Platformer that is mostly standard in the sense of its mechanics (aside from a couple of shiny moments in the ""late game""), but that has a strong point in its artistic choice and the way that the whole aesthetic of it is. It is a very interesting idea that I haven't seen in a lot of other games of this class (if at all really, I can't remember any other game that has done that before).The mechanics of it, as I said, are very standard in comparison to any other puzzle platformer: you jump, you move stuff around, you try to find a way to keep moving forward and not to fall to your dead. The interesting thing about the game comes to play when you are confronted with some of the ""enemies"" of the game, but then again it is more of a time pressure in the puzzling than an actual fight against the AI of the game. Other special things that might happen in the game that changes the mechanics a little bit are some of the puzzles (I cannot explain them without spoiling a bit of the game though).The game can be completed very fast. I finished it in about 3 and a half hours. I did not finish it to a 100% because that includes looking for little ""light bubbles"" around the world that are meant to be collectables or achievements, but these do not affect the game in any way. And again, I cannot imagine that finding all of them might extend the game all that much. The game itself in a mechanic point of view is okay. Maybe a little bit about average, but not much more than that. Challenging at moments and has some interesting ideas. You can be sure that you won't get trough a whole are without dying a couple of times, but it has nothing to do with skills, it has to with the game being a♥♥♥♥♥♥and setting you up to some traps you CANNOT see coming at all. I guess dying is just a part of the game, which actually makes sense considering the artistic view of it.The artistic view and aesthetic of the game are the most attractive elements of this game. The way I would describe it is a black and white world (light and shadow kind of thing) that looks beautiful, but has a creepy and impressionistic element to it. It made me feel a little bit uncomfortable at some points because of the impressionistic nature of the art style. It is not ""gore"" in any way, but it is something that get's close to it in a 2D shadow-like graphics. Nothing to worry about, though; just a dark game. The world is very well made and it pays attention to little details, which is weird considering that you are basically seeing shadows of the world in a 2D view. A very good thing that I have to point out is that the game makes a very good work of letting you know what is actually a platform you can jump on and what is just a part of the background/fordground.There is a story element to the game that, as far as I am concerned, is left to free interpretation throughout the whole game and up to the very end as well, not giving you any answers to any of your questions. Where are you? What/who are you looking for? Why is there other people here? The game has no dialogue at all, but it manages to get across just as much story as it wants to, leaving you with just enough questions for you to keep pushing forward and looking up theories in some forums after you have finished the game.Warts and all, this game is good. It is an experience that I enjoyed. Short and simple, but worth some of your time. Get it if you care more about story than about mechanics.7.5/10			"

Quick Breakdown: Limbo is a beautiful looking puzzle platformer, whos biggest appeal is its art style and ambience.Length: 3-4 hoursScore: 7/10Full Review: Limbo is a fairly simple and straight forward puzzle platformer. You play as a young boy, traversing through limbo to rescue your sister. You’re simply thrown into the game with no real indication of what is going on, and the story doesn’t really develop past that.But let’s talk about the gameplay itself, as a platformer it’s pretty simplistic, there aren’t a whole lot of tricks to master, nor do you really even need to master any. It’s not a game about pixel perfect platforming. Nay, it places greater focus on its puzzles. While there are a few tough puzzles throughout the game, most are able to be solved in a fairly reasonable time frame. Long enough to make you think and feel satisfied once you do solve it, but not so long as to become frustrated with the game. More importantly the puzzles are fun to solve, and the platforming is enjoyable.Now for the main attraction of Limbo, the wonderful looking art style and it’s excellent atmosphere. Limbo has a simple black and white art style that frankly looks fantastic. It’s nothing fancy, but it’s a pleasure to look at.	The art style plays a large part in helping create the wonderful, bleak, atmosphere of the game. There’s a general sense of loneliness, despair, and death hovering in the world of Limbo and pervading throughout the game. Music is used sparingly, occasionally flaring up to indicate danger and heighten the tension, and it helps contribute to the ambience of the game.My main criticism of the game is the lack of anything useful in the options menu. Limbo is a fairly simple game, so it’s not like it needs a bundle of configurable settings, but it lacks options to adjust anything but the brightness. The main thing I would have liked is to have been able to remap the controls, as I much prefer using WASD to move than the arrow keys. Thankfully the controls and gameplay are simple enough that this ends up being a fairly minor complaint, but it would still be a nice addition. (One can also use a controller to play, but as I don’t own one at this time I obviously haven’t used one).Nonetheless, Limbo is a rather fun puzzle platformer with a wonderfully bleak and depressing atmosphere to it.

Or you may not be a fan of this genre of this game*Unstable jump controls 9.8*Puzzle's just way.... to hard*I'd still get it even knowing most of this, I did leave out big part's in this, but give me a little credit this being my first review*To much hype, nothing to back it, look and #3 Yea, like it's depends on the type of games your intoOh, & Just wait till you get to the end!!

												Limbo? More like Hell. Trap Hell. Anyway, it's an atmospheric indie platformer (what a surprise), but the focus is more on creative puzzles than preset mechanics, and the art style is consistent and effective. Tough, but not too tough - very solid.			"

												I was gifted this game by a friend.An absolutley brilliant experience and a brilliant game. It's an arty platformer which avoids the cardinal sin quite a few arty games commit by actually having gameplay.At its core LIMBO is a rather simple puzzle platformer with challening (but not obtuse) puzzles and an atmosphere which will really suck you in and absorb you into a strange colourless world where you can feel all sorts of emotions from fear to sadness to tranquility.This game is a must buy if you are into platformers, arty games or just want a really good experience.

												Very nice plataformer with simple keyboard controls (5 keys). Amazing atmosphere. Sounds are rare but on the right measure. Puzzles are not too hard, but hard enough to keep you playing to the ends (if you are looking for a better challenge, check the secret room). And when replaying it (after learning all mechanics and puzzles), you feel you are watching an animation movie. Recommended. "

												Is it possible to enjoy a game purely on an aesthetic level? ""Limbo's"" puzzles are perfectly fine. If you liked ""Another World"" or ""Flashback"" back in the day you'll probably enjoy Limbo's approach to puzzles (others who hate trial and error in gaming might pull their hair out though). But the puzzles, adequate as they are, are really just a pretext to look at the game, which I think, is one of the better looking I've ever played. With its stark black/white artwork, layers of film grain, and analog hiss the effect is a bit like the video game equivalent of a Guy Maddin movie (Don't know him? Take 5 minutes and see:

. Of course it is a bit strange that a game would take the silent era of film as its ""retro"" model rather than, say, the 8 bit era of video gaming (there's something odd about using digital technology to so lovingly recreate the analog imperfections of another medium), but it's just so gosh darn pretty you don't have much time to think about how it doesn't make much aesthetic sense.

												A perfect example of how video games can be art and how a story can be told without dialogue.

												Dark, atmospheric, and delightfully morbid at times. LIMBO is a fun little puzzle platformer that'll test your brains and your timing.The artstyle is incredible, an entirely greyscale noir feel that adds to occasional spooky and horrific elements. Controls are crisp and animation is fluid.There isn't a ""story"" in the traditional sense, but you can probably interpret it as an allegory for childhood, growing up, and how our fears change as we mature, if you're into that sort of thing.

												LIMBO is a fantastic atmospheric puzzle game. It lives from its simple use of ambient light sources and its sound. It's not that hard to beat like other platform games for example Braid.LIMBO has an awesome and anti frustration auto save game mechanism, where you will never rage quit and still enjoy the game as if you haven't died.You will not get all achievements in your first run, but you have the option to load each chapter again to get 12 / 14 achievements very fast and easy. The achievement 'DING!' is much fun and challenging. The hardest achievement is 'No Point in Dying', but not impossible.If you like Indie games especially puzzle games without have a big story in the background, then this is a game for your library.Recommend!; when it's on sale!, because the main gameplay time is around 3 hours.

												Considering the fact that we constantly have to upgrade our computers or buy new game consoles to just to play new games because of the intense graphics or sound or storylines, it's truly refreshing to not only see a minimalist game, but to see one that does it so astonishingly well. The minimal sounds and visuals create the perfect eerie mood, and the minimal story allows everyone to take something unique away from it. The physics are spot-on and the puzzles are simple while still very challenging. I don't think we'll ever see a game quite like Limbo again, because I can't imagine a future game accomplishing these things at this level of quality without actually ripping it off.			"

You play as a child, or something, that traverses across vast forests, building, factories and other puzzles to reach an ending that feels oddly familiar to the beginning. And you'll just play the game again anyway.Sounds vague, but there's no real plot in the game, or is there? Find out for yourself while taking in the great black and white art style.9.0/10			"

												This is an amazing game. Creative and decently challenging puzzles, and a backstory that has you still wondering.***Spoiler***How about this theory? He would always play at the tree house with his sister. One day climbing down the ladder, it broke and he fell along with it, or he may have slipped. The beginning starts off with his uncertainty and fears. Hence the giant spiders, and the other kids you encounter could either also be in limbo or represent his peers as bullies which explains why they try to harm him. The Hotel, and machinery could be because him and his sister lived near a growing city heavy with construction. At the end, he is trying to find his sister because she is the one he holds dearest and always felt comfort playing in the the tree house with his sister and she straightens up because what she was looking at was your unconscious body and felt your presence behind her as if you are watching over her. Other theories end with the same thing, but he could have been in a car crash. He may have fallen through a window of a hotel, or even a hotel under construction because at the end you see the hotel signs again and more saws. Just some things to consider.			"

												Limbo is an Inde Puzzle Platformer that is mostly standard in the sense of its mechanics (aside from a couple of shiny moments in the ""late game""), but that has a strong point in its artistic choice and the way that the whole aesthetic of it is. It is a very interesting idea that I haven't seen in a lot of other games of this class (if at all really, I can't remember any other game that has done that before).The mechanics of it, as I said, are very standard in comparison to any other puzzle platformer: you jump, you move stuff around, you try to find a way to keep moving forward and not to fall to your dead. The interesting thing about the game comes to play when you are confronted with some of the ""enemies"" of the game, but then again it is more of a time pressure in the puzzling than an actual fight against the AI of the game. Other special things that might happen in the game that changes the mechanics a little bit are some of the puzzles (I cannot explain them without spoiling a bit of the game though).The game can be completed very fast. I finished it in about 3 and a half hours. I did not finish it to a 100% because that includes looking for little ""light bubbles"" around the world that are meant to be collectables or achievements, but these do not affect the game in any way. And again, I cannot imagine that finding all of them might extend the game all that much. The game itself in a mechanic point of view is okay. Maybe a little bit about average, but not much more than that. Challenging at moments and has some interesting ideas. You can be sure that you won't get trough a whole are without dying a couple of times, but it has nothing to do with skills, it has to with the game being a♥♥♥♥♥♥and setting you up to some traps you CANNOT see coming at all. I guess dying is just a part of the game, which actually makes sense considering the artistic view of it.The artistic view and aesthetic of the game are the most attractive elements of this game. The way I would describe it is a black and white world (light and shadow kind of thing) that looks beautiful, but has a creepy and impressionistic element to it. It made me feel a little bit uncomfortable at some points because of the impressionistic nature of the art style. It is not ""gore"" in any way, but it is something that get's close to it in a 2D shadow-like graphics. Nothing to worry about, though; just a dark game. The world is very well made and it pays attention to little details, which is weird considering that you are basically seeing shadows of the world in a 2D view. A very good thing that I have to point out is that the game makes a very good work of letting you know what is actually a platform you can jump on and what is just a part of the background/fordground.There is a story element to the game that, as far as I am concerned, is left to free interpretation throughout the whole game and up to the very end as well, not giving you any answers to any of your questions. Where are you? What/who are you looking for? Why is there other people here? The game has no dialogue at all, but it manages to get across just as much story as it wants to, leaving you with just enough questions for you to keep pushing forward and looking up theories in some forums after you have finished the game.Warts and all, this game is good. It is an experience that I enjoyed. Short and simple, but worth some of your time. Get it if you care more about story than about mechanics.7.5/10			"

Would buy a second one, if they make it 10/10Reason's not to buy.*What story line..?!*A bit short, Still worth it + when it's on sale in my opinon*Maybe not what your looking for, some say there was not a good atmospheric part to the game, and or said there was only 2 colors to the game....*Boring, it's an indie game remember that people. Or you may not be a fan of this genre of this game*Unstable jump controls 9.8*Puzzle's just way.... to hard*I'd still get it even knowing most of this, I did leave out big part's in this, but give me a little credit this being my first review*To much hype, nothing to back it, look and #3 Yea, like it's depends on the type of games your intoOh, & Just wait till you get to the end!!

												Limbo is a puzzle game set in a black-white coloured world which tends to get harder and darker the more you progress. The controls are basic, so you can get started right away without a big learning curve.As I said, the puzzles you encounter get harder the further you are into the game, which is a good way to introduce the player into the type gameplay that Limbo offers and how the players can interact with the world and the environment.More about the puzzles; They are quite unique and the sometimes disturbing or gruesome solutions for them are not what you'd expect. This in combination with the perfect matching atmospheric audio (Which are even a must to complete some puzzles. Dont turn them off!) can/will give you some moments of scare. But that only makes the game feel more alive.The only thing that bothered me was the fact that you can not set the audio volume lower. The loud audio at some chapters of the game became pretty annoying a few times.Overall, this is a great game where you have to set your mind to. It is worth the price if you are into these kind of games. But even if you aren't. It is still an amazing game.9/10			"

REVIEW: LIMBOLimbo is one of those games I had heard of, but never really put on the to-do list. It was only thanks to the generosity of a friend on Steam that I gained a copy to try and complete. But I haven’t been a fan of platformer games for some time, so would I enjoy Limbo?In a mysterious, monochrome world, a boy awakens in a dark forest. He sets out in search of his sister. But in his way are the various denizens of this world, from giant spiders to parasitic worms, and even other kids…There are four words that sum up Limbo: dark, artistic, minimalistic, and frustrating. Easily, the best part of the game is the presentation. It’s dark and moody, the graphics are just right for the macabre style, and the whole atmosphere is enhanced by a dark and appropriate soundtrack. Music and sound effects contribute to an eerie and intimidating atmosphere. It’s like Silent Hill, but, if anything, even darker. While at first glance it appears to be a kid’s game, it is anything but. I dunno what the rating is, but parents, THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS. This is a violent and dark game. Bleakly beautiful and beautifully bleak, but definitely not for kids.The gameplay is another matter entirely. It is hard, even by the gold standard of Nintendo platformers. The gameplay consists of avoiding death and figuring out how to progress by trial and error, or as the publishers once called it, ‘trial and death’. And you will die. A lot. In manifold gruesome fashions. But figuring out how to get by the latest obstacles or adversaries will give you a feeling of accomplishment. Unfortunately, I tended to get more frustrated than feeling like I accomplished anything meaningful.The game comes across as the illegitimate offspring of Silent Hill and Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysey (which, incidentally, was recently re-released on Steam). While the difficulty feels right for such a game, I just wish it wasn’t quite so hard. And the payoff in the minimalist story doesn’t quite work.That being said, Limbo is pretty good. I like it mainly for the presentation more than the gameplay, but the gameplay itself has its own charms. It’s just a touch too hard for my liking…RATING: ***½  "

												One of the earlier games to mark the rise of the indie platformer trend, Limbo is a compelling oddity with one of the most striking and engrossing atmospheres in gaming.  Quite bleak and strangely disturbing, but underneath the layer of gloom lies clever puzzles and simple but highly addicting gameplay.  Highly recommended.			"

												Limbo is an Indie platform  melancholic game that extends beyond the casual indie games, when you first start it you dont see much talk arround the plot, in fact I had to see the reviews so I could find out what the game was about. Apparently, its about a boy who goes for a quest after his sister who fell  in the Limbo. All of the game is played on a grey, white and black environment so that we could get that a sad, creepy, melancholic visual experience. The fact is that when we reach a certain level we get bored with all thoose environments.The game offers us some great puzzle/platform challenges, but also gives us a slow and boring gameplay  which ruins all the emotion.I would recommend this game for those who truly love indie games, and for those who are looking for a different type of game.It wasn't execlly money well spent, actually, but since it was made by an independent developer, it's acceptable.Limbo had excelent scores on Metacritic and IGN, I think you should check some other reviews and watch some gameplays (without spoiler) before you buy the game.

												This is a beautiful game. The art style and music set a mysterious and sinister ambience. The puzzles are nicely varied so the game never feels like a grind. It is divided into zones which morph so naturally that you won't notice until you're right in the next one. The transition to the underground and watching all the cogs and mahinery feel as if you're delving to the inner workings of Limbo. While the puzzles are a little too easy and you will only be stuck scratching your head a few times, they are fun and satisfying to complete. The mute boy you play as is surprisingly endearing. Despite receiving no hints as to who he is, you feel compelled to protect him in this dangerous world and help him to his final goal. You will feel the blow of every brutal death as if they were your own. This game is a wonderful journey and well worth checking out.			"

												um... wow.  just wow.  A person playing this game for the first time is plopped right into the game with no explaination, the protaganist still asleep in a strange 2d silouette world.  it took me a while to figure out what to do, i would suggest to press ""esc"" and check options for the controls (i don't know why its in options, you cant change them...)  this game consists of many simplistic puzzles that require skill and exceptional timing, which are challenging and satisfying to solve.  in all honesty, the gameplay itself is nothing to be amazed over.  it's simple, and a little repetetive.  That is not, however, why i personally love this game, it has a wonderful ambience, and does a good job of making the player feel truely alone and hopeless.  the anamation style used is incredable for this purpose, and just to increase the intensity, no music plays during gameplay. very little sound at all realy.  the whole experience is truely one of a kind, and nigh unmatched.

It's very physics driven, with some of the traps being sprung by levers and see-saws, gravity switches, rope swings, and the like all come into play when you're rushing through Limbo to save your sister. The game is challenging, and can make you chuckle with a few easter eggs, but it lacks some replayability and doesn't have a story other than you're a boy looking for his sister. At about three hours (if you nab all of the achievements) the price to play ratio is a little steep if you grab it full price.7/10			"

												This game is a 2D game, a simple game, but it's a masterpiece. This game makes your brain work, it makes you be concentrated, sometimes panicked, sometimes calm. I recommend this because: > improves your concentrations> improves the speed of thinking> it makes you think abstract> improves your agility> calms you down> not very colourful so you eyes are resting> it worths 10 euros even if it seems a simple gameplay If you got this in your library then play it and if not buy it!

												I'll start things off by saying that I did have a hard time getting this game to work at first, which was a disappointment considering how much I was looking forward to playing it. The issue being that after installation, the application would get hung up on the ""preparing to launch"" dialogue box without actually launching the game.That being said, after quite a bit of research I discovered that many others were having the same problem as I was and came to the unfortunate realization that there were no actual solutions to be found. I immediately headed over to Playdead to contact their support team and to my surprise, they responded very quickly. Just to give you an idea because frankly, I think it deserves mentioning; I sent out my initial e-mail at 3:41am, to which I received a response at 6:17am, less than three hours later. Needless to say, I was quite impressed.The individual that contacted me seemed genuinely nice - as far as these things can be judged without speaking to the person directly - and found them to be friendly, concise and very helpful. I was provided a number of possible solutions and steps to take, along with clear instructions on how best to solve the problem.I'm not sure if the issue is the same for everyone, but if I were to make an educated guess based on the system requirements and my own experience, it seems Limbo throws an error if the Shader Model hardware utilized by your GPU is outdated. In order for this to work properly, the easiest thing to do would simply be to download the latest drivers for your particular video card. I also updated DirectX and made sure there were no pending updates for my system whatsoever, just to be on the safe side. With that out of the way, the problem I had was a thing of the past and wasted no time in booting up the game to see what I had been missing out on.My opinion may be a little biased given that I'm a sucker for these types of games but with that in mind, on to the actual gameplay...You start off in the middle of a somber forest filled with various dangers, obstacles, and good old-fashioned film grain effects, which I have to say were an interesting design choice; one that was quite beneficial as it added to the overall feel of the game. Within the first couple of minutes, you quickly discover that the concept and control scheme are simple enough, which is what you want for a puzzle-platformer.All you need are five buttons (four arrow keys and ""Ctrl"") on your keyboard: walk left, walk right, push/pull objects and climb ropes and ladders. That's all you get. Can't get much simpler than that, right? Well, I suppose you can, but that's beside the point. Don't let this fool you though because the game is quite challenging in certain areas as you brave the perils of various twisted environments as a young boy in search of his sister.The story elements present in LIMBO are subtle and left up to the interpretation of the player, inciting a great deal of speculation among fans as to what the boy's treacherous journey actually means. If your curiosity was strong enough to warrant a search of the game's plot you would have found out right away that there aren't any definitive answers, yet there are some clues and a general understanding regarding certain aspects of the story.There was no BGM to speak of like you would traditionally be expecting but rather just the subdued, ambient background noise that seems to fit the developer's intentions very well. The black and white tones and sparse lighting came together nicely and added a great deal to the experience. The effects seemed appropriate to the situation in which the player finds themselves and added to the atmosphere and immersion of the game to give it an eerie, haunting feel.One thing of note that I don't see or rather hear in a lot of games are that certain areas actually employ the use of auditory cues in order to progress. This is most prominent in the secret level, where the player must traverse an entire stage - that is somewhat longer than prior chapters -  in complete darkness. Do yourself a favor and crank up the volume before attempting this. Having a good headset or even a pair of speakers here will make your life a lot easier.The puzzles had an interesting curve and there was a definite, noticeable progression to the difficulty, which flowed exceptionally well and I felt kept things from getting tedious. At the same time, the puzzles weren't so easy as to induce a coma from mind-numbing boredom or hard enough that they would make you rage-quit or suffer for hours on end trying to solve them. LIMBO found the perfect balance between the two by providing enough challenge and stimulation that makes you want to play it again and again.All in all the game was quite fun. I've played through 3 times already collecting all the achievements and it still hasn't gotten dull. It has 39 chapters, not including the secret area, which may seem like it's a bit longer but is honestly on the shorter side of that spectrum. Start to finish I'd say it's possible to complete the game in roughly forty-five to an hour, give or take a few minutes; after you get your bearings on the first play-through that is. Keep in mind, however, this doesn't account for speed-runners, who I can only assume are capable of finishing in much less time.Bottom line is, Limbo is a simplistic, streamlined puzzle-platforming game that has a certain charm to it and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre or anyone else for that matter. It was well worth the effort it took to get the game working and after I had a chance to play it for myself, I have to say that all the hype surrounding it has not been exaggerated. LIMBO is a phenomenal piece of creativity, a credit to the indie community and the industry as a whole.			"

												Limbo is a relatively short but very worthwhile voyage. The game took me a little over 3 hours on first play-through but for more casual gamers should last a little longer. From the beginning you are thrown into a very dark depressing place with no real understanding of why you are there. The graphical style is beautifully creepy and the sound is second to none. Play with headphones turned up loud to get every rain sodden footstep and every sickening thud of the bear trap severing you in two. The puzzles are quite challenging requiring both skill and thought, with a great sense of achievement upon completion.			"

												Impossible to describe in excrutiating detail, because LIMBO has none, and that's a good thing. Simple and heavily atmospheric sidescrolling beauty with plenty of brain-wracking puzzles that require prediction, careful timing and execution and even those simple booby traps that need no more than a watchful gaze. Very simple controls going nowhere further than five buttons perfectly complement it's play-style and ""live-and-learn"" approach to side-scrollers.Not recommended for those with terminal arachnophobia.

												Another Indie game that deserves all the praise it can get. LIMBO is original, dark (literally), and disturbing. What I especially love about this game is that the story is so vague that it allows you to draw your own conclusions about any questions you have about the game. Like ""Why is the boy stuck in LIMBO?"", ""How did he in his sister die?"",  ""Does everything in the enviornment tie in together somehow?"" Like I said it's all up to your interpretation. (You should see some of the theories on TVtropes.com). If you love puzzle platformers, or dark and disturbing piece of entertainment, I'd say give it a buy. Though if a vague story can take the fun out of a game for you stay away from this game, like I said the story is all about interpretation.			"

												This game is possibly the most unique game I have ever played. The search for a fun, mind-working, and HD side scroller has been going on for me for a while now. Well the search has come to an end. This game makes you think but it has more than just that. While it is simply black and white, its really really HD and is super smooth. The fact that there is no music is absolutly the right way to go. It makes it seem that much more unique and really adds to the mystery aspect of the game. They tell you nothing at the beginning, not even the controls. You dont know who you are, where you are, OR what you are doing. And let me tell you...I've never been more entertained with such a lack of information in my life. BUY. THIS. GAME.			"

												Now, my lovely people who are spending their valuable time reading this rather mediocre review of a first-rate game, hello and welcome. LIMBO deserves a far-greater write up than what I have to offer, but the thought counts, amiright? Hopefully I'm right. For the benefit of the existence of this fangirl review, we'll say I am.Where to begin? If I had a way to shrink this game down to fit into a locket, I would. It would lie near my excitable heart alongside SSX 3. SSX 3! Need this review say any more? After this one last thought, no. I'm smitten for SSX 3. I have a particularly strong leaning towards LIMBO.I adore them both. They're my yin and yang of games: alone they're great, but with both in my life, they balance out my love.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED "

												I would rate this a solid 8/10. I loved the rich tone that is set from the very beginning. This game is fantastically creepy and horrifying yet extremely intriguing. Who are you? Where are you? Why are you there? LIMBO is minimal in design and story, but it does not disappoint. The game itself is gorgeous. The puzzles are just challenging enough that you get frustrated but feel accomplished when you figure it out. I killed myself in ways I didn't even know were possible. My only gripe is the ending, but I think everyone interpretates it differently. Regardless, well worth your time if you enjoy unique puzzle platformers and games that have a strong ambiance.			"

												Want something to exercise your brains? Try Limbo.The game is very atmospheric puzzle/plat-former game. I found it to be very enjoyable for the most part but some parts were frustrating. It's not that the puzzles were hard, most of it made sense and you will find solutions easily. Performing it was the difficult part, like jumping on a very specific spot and a few millimeters off and you will fail. Reminds of the old Famicom/NES games. It doesn't have any deep story. You woke up in a forest and while exploring you found out that everyone and everything was out there to kill you so your main goal was to escape. The ending was one of those that left it for the players to decide it's meaning. You will play Limbo mainly for its puzzles.			"

												Long story short: a great puzzle platformer!Details:The graphics style with its only two colors (black and white, and its mixing gray) is causing a very nice oppressive atmosphere. All animations are very detailed and smooth, in fact you can only see silhouettes. Depth is created with blur.Level transitions are fluent, no loading screens, which creates a nostalgic feeling. You think you can always go back from where you came from. In Fact you can't, as some geographical obstacles block the way back.Even though the main purpose of this game is to solve puzzles, which are using physics and differ in grade of difficulty, LIMBO also has a profound background story or at least events.First you have to defend yourself against a spider, and cut of three of its legs. Then it's fleeing, but catches you later on a webbed floor. As you escape the spider is following you again, and you head it to a small village. The people are not delighted of course, as the spider is killing them. So they also try to kill you, in return you have to kill them. Afterwards you also manage to escape from the spider, which is so hurt, that only one leg is left. To get further, you have to tear out also the last leg, and use the spider's body.Later you see that the people of the village are sometimes controlled by a worm, which causes them to walk into water and to drown. Again you have to use a dead body to complete your journey.Several times you try to reach a girl, but you are led away by a worm or cannot reach her.All these incidents are disturbing in some kind and thought-provoking.It's a lot of fun to get all hidden eggs, and find the hidden level.I completed the game on Linux, it was running perfect, even the XBox 360 controller rumbled.

												What can I say about Limbo that has not already been said.  It Dark, disturbing at points, atmospheric, beautiful and enchanting.  It is easy to play but engaging at all times, presents puzzles to you but not obviously as a puzzle.  The main character is childlike but the world is harsh.  The story is subtle but evolves perfectly as the play and leaves you with questions.This game should not be remade, changed or even have a sequel. It stands on its own in many respects and just is.If it was £30 it should still be bought and played, just so that you can say you were there when it happened. I have been playing games since pong and there are many games that I am proud to be able to say I was part of at the time of their breakthrough.  Limbo is one such game.  So much so that I have ordered the special edition on Amazon, just because I want to be able to hand it to my children when the time is right. "

												Limbo is a puzzle platformer that will keep you on your toes until the very end as you regularly encounter unfamiliar obstacles.  The controls are minimal and the puzzles aren't terribly difficult to solve, making the game inviting for people of all ages.  The game is masterfully designed and animated.  From the very beginning you will feel immersed in the strange dark world of Limbo.  The story is not very long, and there is not much replayability unless you want to go for all of the achievements.  Keeping this in mind, Limbo remains one of the best indie games on the market.  I highly recommend adding it to your collection.			"

												This is a beautiful game. The art style and music set a mysterious and sinister ambience. The puzzles are nicely varied so the game never feels like a grind. It is divided into zones which morph so naturally that you won't notice until you're right in the next one. The transition to the underground and watching all the cogs and mahinery feel as if you're delving to the inner workings of Limbo. While the puzzles are a little too easy and you will only be stuck scratching your head a few times, they are fun and satisfying to complete. The mute boy you play as is surprisingly endearing. Despite receiving no hints as to who he is, you feel compelled to protect him in this dangerous world and help him to his final goal. You will feel the blow of every brutal death as if they were your own. This game is a wonderful journey and well worth checking out.			"

												Limbo is an Indie platform  melancholic game that extends beyond the casual indie games, when you first start it you dont see much talk arround the plot, in fact I had to see the reviews so I could find out what the game was about. Apparently, its about a boy who goes for a quest after his sister who fell  in the Limbo. All of the game is played on a grey, white and black environment so that we could get that a sad, creepy, melancholic visual experience. The fact is that when we reach a certain level we get bored with all thoose environments.The game offers us some great puzzle/platform challenges, but also gives us a slow and boring gameplay  which ruins all the emotion.I would recommend this game for those who truly love indie games, and for those who are looking for a different type of game.It wasn't execlly money well spent, actually, but since it was made by an independent developer, it's acceptable.Limbo had excelent scores on Metacritic and IGN, I think you should check some other reviews and watch some gameplays (without spoiler) before you buy the game.

												I would rate this a solid 8/10. I loved the rich tone that is set from the very beginning. This game is fantastically creepy and horrifying yet extremely intriguing. Who are you? Where are you? Why are you there? LIMBO is minimal in design and story, but it does not disappoint. The game itself is gorgeous. The puzzles are just challenging enough that you get frustrated but feel accomplished when you figure it out. I killed myself in ways I didn't even know were possible. My only gripe is the ending, but I think everyone interpretates it differently. Regardless, well worth your time if you enjoy unique puzzle platformers and games that have a strong ambiance.			"

The first couple deaths were kind of visually shocking for me. It just felt visceral and sudden. Impactful. I wanted so badly to not die even through there's not really consequences for it. I was slightly disappointed the strange people you can't catch up with weren't incorporated more later in the game.I would recommend playing this if you're into puzzle platformers.			"

												A beautiful, short platformer. Although it only uses a simple dark style, this creates a very special and unique atmosphere that is hardly ever seen in video games. Simply put, the artwork of the game is just awesome and I’m surprised at how much can be achieved just by using silhouettes. Playing through Limbo felt like discovering a work of art. Its puzzles are sometimes challenging, specially towards the end, but they don’t really become annoying at any point. The music is fitting, but what I liked the most is how well silence is used throughout the game. It really makes you feel lonely and lost. The biggest highlight of the game is, however, the appearance of the spider. Just seeing the way it moves sends shivers down my spine. It’s the kind of stuff that would have given me nightmares back in the day. Definitely one of the scariest and creepiest enemies in video games ever. Seriously, kill that thing with fire and bury it as deep as you can.   And last we've got the ""story"". Yeah… well, I’m not sure I really understand what the game is about, but that doesn’t mean I did not enjoy playing it any less. it's true that I felt kind of puzzled at the end of the game when I realized I didn’t know what was going on though. As it happens to be fairly short, I’ll gladly return to it at some point in the future and maybe then I’ll be able to propose a theory or two about the true meaning of the game... until then… well, just stay away from that six legged terrifying creature and enjoy the game.

												Limbo is a phenomenal game. I was reading through both positive and negative reviews, and noticed that the negative review section complained that this wasn't a skill game, it was a trial and error game, and that there was no story. The story is obvious and is included in the title. A boy is thrown into limbo to save his sister. The rest of the story is for the user to piece together. It gives hints and clues throughout the entire game, and shows you what may be important, and what may not be important. It's amazing how much we can speculate. Onto skill, this game isn't as much of a trial and error game as people say. Once you understand how the puzzles in limbo work, you can begin to understand while looking at the puzzles and solve. Limbo is a captivating active visual and emotional experience, and I love it.			"

In recent years though games went from being difficult and chellenging to rewarding you for taking a step out of your house and in this age of coddling and babying it's nice to see a game that isn't afraid to punch you in the face. Limbo is short but it's dark atmosphere and difficult platforming more than make up for it. This game takes me back to when I had to buckle down and sit through a game for hours. Like I said, the only drawback to this game is that it's so short.If anyone out there still enjoys good platforming I'd highly recommend it. A solid 7/10.			"

												At long last, one humble bundle gave me the oportunity to finally play this game, which i knew for years thanks to publicity in gaming and technology blogs.Sure as hell, this is a really good looking game. It plays like platforming games from 20 years ago (think first Prince of Persia), but the difficulty is not about reflexes and good timing, but about how you approach every part of the level, shall i say 'rooms'.The game consists in a series of puzzles, where one time you have to use a box to keep moving, and another time you have to deal with switches or monsters.Really rewarding, almost soozing, and amazingly beautiful.The bad side: you can complete the game in about 2 hours or so. Once you have done it, you are left with the achievements (which are finding hidden objects throughout the game), and a secret level, which is amazingly hard to finish, the best part of the game in my opinion.All and all, really good game, short, and without any replay value other than completing it without diying, or showing it to your friends, but without a doubt a really nice experience, suitable for a one sitting run down.8/10 "

												Limbo is a beautiful, atmospheric puzzle platformer with a hard edge. What story it has is largely implicit—the game contains no dialogue. You simply wake in a dark wood, apparently a child, and set off to explore the dingy place in which you find yourself. But the genre of the game is certainly horror, though without most of the usual tropes. You are fragile—easily hurt, unable to swim, essentially defenseless—in a hostile and trap-ridden place. You will die many times. And the game does not divert your gaze from your death but rather renders each different mode of your demise in somewhat disturbing detail. The artistic style of the game simultaneously keeps this from being too macabre and contributes greatly to the eerie atmosphere. The game's graphics are entirely silhouettes in shades of grey. Yet the landscapes and objects feel very detailed. Beautifully done lighting effects give the impression of a layered world mostly in shadow. All this makes for a beautiful noir environment well worth admiration in its own right. This game is more immersive with black and white outlines than much I’ve played that had expensive 3D-graphics.A subtler strength of the game is the way its physics feel naturalistic—you are acutely aware of the weight of objects and the force of gravity.  I doubt that the game’s engine is particularly remarkable in this regard, it’s an aesthetic effect. Great attention has been paid to the visual details of motion. But I think it also comes from player movement: in many games you play as a character with outsized physical capabilities. Even in shooters and platformers where such isn’t part of the story your movements are subtly superhuman (think of the lateral jumping featured in most platformers). Not here. Here you have a painfully tiny lateral jump and a rather slow top speed. Here objects don’t just slide easily into place but are dragged only with great effort.The largest complaint I had with LIMBO was that it was too short. Though the puzzles were good, and admirably varied, not too many were very difficult. If one is adept at this sort of thing one could easily complete the game in just a few hours. They are an excellent few hours though. The puzzles are crisp, things to be grasped, not just fiddled with. For a little while LIMBO takes you to an unsettling, engrossing otherworld. And I’d very much like to visit again.			"

												Very few games have the ability to make you feel smart when you play them - the Portal series comes to mind - and Limbo is very, very good at it. Add to that an amazingly consistent art style and atmosphere, and it's easily one of the better indie games of 2011.			"

												Limbo manages to prove what many have started to question over the last few years. Are video games art? If you want my opinion, I honestly think they are, but not all of them. That said, Limbo is definitely one of those games that manages to push the boundaries of standard puzzle platformers and great looking little games to the maximum. Not only the sound design is stellar and immersive, probably just as immersive as Amnesia The Dark Descent but the white and black graphical style gives it an unique touch and feel to the game. The storyline is quite tricky because there's no dialogue and you only few a few remnants of civilization on the early to mid game so it's up to the player to make a story of their own.Some of the puzzles might become abit frustrating after a few tries because they require some timing but other than that I have no complains whatsoever. Limbo is a masterpiece and one of a kind that everyone who likes to play videogames or appreciates art should experience atleast once on a lifetime.			"

												All in all, a dark fun puzzle game.The art is done very well. It is obvious after only a few minutes of gameplay that the game was 50% atmosphere. This dark art mixed with the dark deaths and situations really makes the game interesting to play in of itself. You want to know what kind of craziness is after the next situation. The gameplay is solid as well. They know how to use their engine to make some really neat and sometimes frustrating puzzles. The story was simple... or I thought. In the beginning I would say that escaping this dark world would be the goal of the character. But it slowly drifted towards killing everything that moves. And the end seems a little out of character for what I was just put through. But conquering this dark world felt fun and dodging death is always a good time so it kept my attention pretty well. "

												limbo is a ""relaxing"" platformer horror which is extreamly adicting and extreamly tense. the feeling that the game gives you is anxiety as you worry what is a head  of you. the game play is fun a smooth nothing more to be said. but the best part of the game is the story, people who have played the game may be thinking ""What story there is no character interaction or dialog"". but when i played through the game i found that the game is a story of a boy with mental health issues such as depression this is shown by the endless darkness and constant fealing of hopelessness and failure. the best way to describe this game is not calling its a ""game"" but calling it an ""experience"" this game is up for interpretation and that is where it thrives, how the game can mean so many diffrent things for diffrent people. it will make you feel horrible but in a good way some how, the world is immersive and interesting.  highly recomended!

												Limbo is really great. It looks great, feels great, has great controls and especially the level design and all the puzzles in them are very smart. Some call it a platformer, because at first glance there is jumping around and climbing (ladders), but given that the world is primarily filled with puzzles, you could just as well call it an adventure. The game has an almost unique feel to it and it is definitely a true original. Even games that were most likely ""inspired"" by this, were still rather good. I'm thinking of The Swapper and The Cave. Now I obviously bought the game (:P), but if you are among the people who got it for free in June 2016, please at least play it, instead of just dumping it on your digital shelf.The game is also rather short (you can finish it in 4+ hours), which is another reason why there is no excuse to not play it. Because of that the game gets never boring and it should keep your interest until the end.			"

												So dark, so creepy, and still so beautiful. This game has no storyline, no tutorial, no names, no voices, no music. And that's why, they made a game so captivating that the only thing you want to know is whether or not there will be a next level to solve.Indie developers make art, and here you have the proof.			"

												First thoughts: ""Oh this is a simple, relaxing, light game, I like it!"" but no, it appeared to be quite creepy compared to the first impression I got and I still like it. Lots of deaths is a must. It's like, if you don't die, you won't go any further since trial and error play a big part in this. The whole black theme is kinda depressing though, at least this is what I felt.			"

												All in all, a dark fun puzzle game.The art is done very well. It is obvious after only a few minutes of gameplay that the game was 50% atmosphere. This dark art mixed with the dark deaths and situations really makes the game interesting to play in of itself. You want to know what kind of craziness is after the next situation. The gameplay is solid as well. They know how to use their engine to make some really neat and sometimes frustrating puzzles. The story was simple... or I thought. In the beginning I would say that escaping this dark world would be the goal of the character. But it slowly drifted towards killing everything that moves. And the end seems a little out of character for what I was just put through. But conquering this dark world felt fun and dodging death is always a good time so it kept my attention pretty well. "

												For a game which took roughly 2~3 hours to beat, not including an hour and a half being out of my house, I can safely say that LIMBO definetly was worth to get while it was free on June 21~22nd of 2016's summer.While the story is nothing too big or tries to go for any twist, it's pretty much a somewhat non-story type of game where you just try to accomplish the goal of going right, and eventually reaching the end.The game itself gives off an atmosphere of uncanny, but instead of just throwing around blood and gore, the mere darkness speaks for itself. Sure enough, there will be some gruesome deaths to your protagonist should you make a mistake, but sure enuogh the game is not on the level of horror as in ""oh noes I gots jumpscared"", but rather the horror levels of not knowing really what's happening.Gameplay wise though it's a mix of puzzles and platformers. Being that there should be one or few parts where you'd need an almost precise timing, but for the puzzles at most it's either simply using whatever's grabbable by your character, a slight thinking outside the box or trial and error, by which I mean trial and deaths, because it's quite unlikely anyone would get through the first time without dying to something that you didn't expect, which is...kind of annoying, honestly.Besides that though, I really enjoyed whatever little time I had playing this, and I can safely say that this game is a 7~9. Reason is that while the game was definetly fun and the puzzles felt fair enough to not need a walkthrough to figure them out, there was still alot of cases where you'd need either some almost crazy timing that normally wouldn't be deemed as the solution to the puzzle, thus leading to alot of death in the way. And I can't give it a perfect score either because the story in general, while not too terrible, is still kind of basic and almost forgettable.But I'll give you that, the infamous creature of this game sure was the most interesting story I had throughout it.

												Limbo is just as great now as it was years ago when I first played through it on the Xbox 360. This is the gold standard for puzzle platformers, and proof that indie games can put new life into an old genre, provided that a little creativity is involved.The biggest surprise for me on this second playthrough was the existence of a secret level - it wasn't included in the console version I played. It was fun to experience new content when I wasn't expecting any, and it was the perfect amount of ridiculous combined with challenging - just what's needed for a secret level. I'd encourage anyone who hasn't done that part yet to give it a try.			"

												“Indie Puzzle-Platformer” isn’t the most enticing of terms for a PC gamer. It seems like such an accessible kind of game that every bedroom dev and their mother has made one, but that’s only because of games like Limbo. Probably preaching to the choir here but on the assumption that you’ve never heard of this game, I’ll tell you why it’s great.The mechanics are the standard 2-D side scrolling fare, except your movement speed and jump height feel a little less than other games of the genre. But that really plays into the main selling point of the game, which is the atmosphere. The entire game is in a bleak, high-contrast, black and white and beside some beautiful ambient sounds one might almost call music, the main sounds you’ll here are the ones made by interacting with the environment: Creaking wood or trudging footsteps – sounds normally minimised – are amplified to contribute an atmosphere of I guess “loneliness”. I’m unashamedly in love with this game’s sound design.Limbo’s release rightly sparked up the “games as art” debate when it was released, and if you experience it for a moment you’ll see why. All the above and more contribute to make you feel things: more than a usual sense of accomplishment or kick of adrenalin (although it has those too). It draws you in and makes you feel lost and powerless, but with a sense of hope spurred on by every small victory over the environment. Limbo is after all a game about a journey. Where from or to is not readily explained and it doesn’t really matter because the getting there is the experience. Every obstacle you overcome is simple but satisfying because it brings you closer to your goal, even though you have no idea when or where that is. And the journey never gets boring. The moment you get bored of the trudging moving of boxes on foot, the game shakes things up by rotating the screen or giving you a brain slug (no, really).If you have no patience for trial-and-error gameplay then maybe the puzzles might irritate you a bit. The game will unfairly kill you sometimes, but pick you up right before your death with the knowledge of the oncoming buzzsaw. Also, if you’re expecting an especially long game you’ll be pretty disappointed (unless you SUCK at puzzles). Oh and if you don’t have a wired 360 controller you might fall afoul of imprecise digital keyboard controls.Negatives done? OK, roundup: Limbo is beautiful, atmospheric and (for me) the right level of challenging. I’d hesitate to call it perfect except that I can’t think of anything I’d change, but then I’m not a developer. "

												This game is six years old and I finally took the time to play it. Really unique style but has puzzles that are similar to Portal (pushing crates onto buttons and whatnot). Other than that there were some pretty tricky challenges, but just as the difficulty curve began to steep the game suddenly ends in a very anti climatic way - maybe that was the point but it kind of made me wish there was something else for me to go back to, like Portal. So I just uninstalled it, done, finished, five dollars for 3 hours of good fun. If you haven't played it after all this time I suggest you do, but only when it's on sale again or you recieve a discount for it, because once you've finished it (which only takes 2 hours max) there's nothing else.

Quick Breakdown: Limbo is a beautiful looking puzzle platformer, whos biggest appeal is its art style and ambience.Length: 3-4 hoursScore: 7/10Full Review: Limbo is a fairly simple and straight forward puzzle platformer. You play as a young boy, traversing through limbo to rescue your sister. You’re simply thrown into the game with no real indication of what is going on, and the story doesn’t really develop past that.But let’s talk about the gameplay itself, as a platformer it’s pretty simplistic, there aren’t a whole lot of tricks to master, nor do you really even need to master any. It’s not a game about pixel perfect platforming. Nay, it places greater focus on its puzzles. While there are a few tough puzzles throughout the game, most are able to be solved in a fairly reasonable time frame. Long enough to make you think and feel satisfied once you do solve it, but not so long as to become frustrated with the game. More importantly the puzzles are fun to solve, and the platforming is enjoyable.Now for the main attraction of Limbo, the wonderful looking art style and it’s excellent atmosphere. Limbo has a simple black and white art style that frankly looks fantastic. It’s nothing fancy, but it’s a pleasure to look at.	The art style plays a large part in helping create the wonderful, bleak, atmosphere of the game. There’s a general sense of loneliness, despair, and death hovering in the world of Limbo and pervading throughout the game. Music is used sparingly, occasionally flaring up to indicate danger and heighten the tension, and it helps contribute to the ambience of the game.My main criticism of the game is the lack of anything useful in the options menu. Limbo is a fairly simple game, so it’s not like it needs a bundle of configurable settings, but it lacks options to adjust anything but the brightness. The main thing I would have liked is to have been able to remap the controls, as I much prefer using WASD to move than the arrow keys. Thankfully the controls and gameplay are simple enough that this ends up being a fairly minor complaint, but it would still be a nice addition. (One can also use a controller to play, but as I don’t own one at this time I obviously haven’t used one).Nonetheless, Limbo is a rather fun puzzle platformer with a wonderfully bleak and depressing atmosphere to it.

												One of the earlier games to mark the rise of the indie platformer trend, Limbo is a compelling oddity with one of the most striking and engrossing atmospheres in gaming.  Quite bleak and strangely disturbing, but underneath the layer of gloom lies clever puzzles and simple but highly addicting gameplay.  Highly recommended.			"

												A giant spider tries to kill him, it's not possible to float or swim in the water as you immediately sink, only humans he meets are extremly hostile and later in front of him crushed on the most brutal way possible, hanging illuminative things that jump on his head leave him with little or no kinesthetic control, only remnant of some old civilization is a ""HOTEL"" sign in destroyed city which is btw. broken and electrified... - frankly there are death threats all over the place.If this kid ever receives proper psychological therapy, he's a serious Navy SEAL candidate.

Un mundo terrorifico con criaturas, bichos y puzzles dentro del ambiente lo hacen un juego de pensar, incluso las cosas que menos esperarías serán la solución. Es un juego sencillo pero difícil...

												Creepy and funny at the same time!Best indie-game that i have played so far. The atmosphere from the first 10 (maybe 15) charapters is creepy and tense, with a lot of original and unexpected traps (from which you will certainly die at least once!). The last 2/3 from the game tend to have similar levels, but it wasn't boring for me to finish the game. The hardest part is to find the eggs (for achievments and a super difficult secret level), and of course they are hidden in such spots that it is hard to imagine how first gamers of Limbo found them, without looking in a guide. The puzzle aspect of the game is simply amazing, many different tasks that require imagination, creative solutions, and some skills of controlling the main character.9/10			"

												So... how to start...They made this game very good and i really enjoyed it, but there are some things i dont like. 1st: (warning - spoiler of beggining part) I dont know how to describe it, so i will use one part of the game.There is a huge spider, if u wont kill him, you cant go through the game. You need to kill the spider with trap, which is on ther tree and you cant pick it. I think, you just cant know, that you need the spider to ,,knock"" the ground, when he tries to kill you, and this will make little earthquake or how to call it, and the trap will fall. Things like this, when you cant know what to do, because it doesnt make a sense are in this game, but i didnt notice so much that it can make the game boring.2nd: The game is in the middle part stereotype and it isnt about logic, its like that you know what to do, but you need more tries to make it, and this repeates. So this part of game is quite about luck. So... I recommend this game, how i said, i really enjoyed it - especially the ending part, which is i think really hard and you need nice timing. And, i got this game for free, so i am happy :D But i think it is worth the 10 e you need to spend, and hunting achievements is nice too.			"

There's no unique gameplay mechanic, but I was sucked into the game world, and that's, I think, what the real unique selling point of this game is. It's very immersive, and it's atmosphere is incredible.I don't think the gameplay is perfect, but Limbo makes up for it with (somtimes disturbing) immersion.			"

												The game is very atmospheric and the puzzles are good and challeging. However, some of the puzzles don't lend themselves to the game very well in that sometimes you need to piece together things through assumptions rather than JUST analyzing things in the map/world. I guess Darksiders has spoiled me a little bit in that regard.Otherwise, i'd give this game an 8.5/10. It deserves a little more than just a solid 8 you know.			"

												Limbo is a physics based puzzle platformer, but a first glance at it casts a message as a game full of grim and creepy images. This isn’t a horror game at all as this game is focused on platforming and solving physics puzzles, but Limbo has a distinctly dark atmosphere that suits the style and theme when playing through.There isn’t too much in terms of story. A boy wakes up in a forest, and as the game description states, tries to find his sister. There is no dialogue at all in the game, as the only things that expand on this story are the various interactions with other people and creatures as you keep moving forward in each level. The story does get resolved later on, though that is something that will be revealed along the way as the game continues.As a platformer game, the boy that you control doesn’t have much in terms of abilities. All the boy can do is walk, jump, and perform actions on other objects. As the game progresses, new level objects come in to play with different game mechanics to utilize. In the beginning, most puzzles tend to be simple platforming challenges. Later on, more difficult physics puzzles start to appear, requiring some puzzle solving compared to the easy solutions in the beginning. Toward the end, the puzzles are much harder and more involved, also requiring some good timing as well. Throughout the game, trial and error is a core aspect of solving the puzzles. You can definitely get away by being observant and thinking about each puzzle logically, but the harder puzzles require jumping into hazards to see what things do or to get a clue on how to solve the puzzle. The difficulty starts out quite easy, and becomes quite tough near the end of the game that the puzzles require some thought and coordination. Limbo’s simple platforming gameplay gives way for the interesting and well crafted physics puzzles, which require some deaths to successfully complete each puzzle.The art style for Limbo is one of the biggest motivators for the general tone of the game. The entire game is done like a black and white movie, complete with some film grain and blur to enhance the effect. The 2D design of the world though is quite beautiful in a way, with black silhouettes against gray shaded backgrounds. There is plenty of detail with the background scenery having softer blurred designs while the game objects sport hard, yet rounded shapes. This black and white style does heighten the creepy nature of the game a bit, evoking a feeling like watching old horror movies.The grim, grisly nature of Limbo is evident throughout the game, with many things hiding until they pop out to kill the boy. Early deaths are quite gory and violent, with the boy being dismembered or mauled in several ways. These things work well with the black and white style by simplifying details while still capturing the harshness of the world. These bloody deaths actually happen less later in the game, as more focus shifts on to the puzzles set in a more isolated man made environment. Overall, the dark style of the game works well with the art style for a creepy and bleak world.Keeping in tune with the dark themes of the game, there are no distinct songs in Limbo. Instead, the game uses an ambient soundtrack that heightens the mood and conveys game information. The sounds of each environment sets the backdrop and the tone, while subtle changes in the music sends a message of what is happening in the game. In addition to the ambient soundtrack adding so much in terms of tone and gameplay, the sound design is very well done. The sounds for the hazards sound distinct from the music which helps players recognize obstacles, while the sounds for deaths sound quite gruesome. With the ambient music and well designed sounds, the eerie atmosphere of the game is heighted more as each action unfolds.With heavy dark and grim tones, Limbo delivers some fun and somewhat challenging puzzle platforming wrapped up with a unique style. Each of the various aspects of the game work together to deliver this kind of foreboding atmosphere. As the game’s style is draws you in, the gameplay smoothly runs through the world with difficulty arising later on. Limbo works as a great experience of a game, both in the style it achieves, and the puzzle platforming gameplay that offers some good challenge with its crafty levels.			"

TL;DR Limbo is a Puzzle / Platformer that is quite trickyRating: 7/10Pros:+Short: Doesn't overstay it's welcom+Interesting Mechanics: Each puzzle starts fairly simply, then eventually ramps up into something quite challenging+Aesthetics: The black and White aesthetics is consistant and quite thought provoking+Achievements mean something: The achievements can be quite tricky to get to, even if you know where they are, especially the hidden achievementCons:-Short: The game for me  quite abruptly ends after You crash through the wall at the end and find your sister under the tree which sort of made me feel underwhelmed at how the ending played out and disappointed in  how the game loops back around to the forest quickly after the factory area-Non-intuitive Puzzles: Some puzzles require knowledge you can only gain AFTER you have died a few times in an area, which makes it extremely tricky to get the under 5 deaths achievement on the first playthrough without resorting to a walkthroughNOTE: I got this game for free as part of the give-away on the Steam Store page			"

												Minimal graphics and a subtle sound track make for tremendous atmosphere. It is MUCH more fun and interesting than I had expected. The physics made every death hilarious, so even dying is amusing and forgivable. The puzzles got pretty tricky in spots. Very clever game. The ending might make some people crazy, but I thought it was impactful. It brought home the meaning of the title. That being said, I was pretty disappointed that it was sooo short. I guess that is to be expected, but I felt it was pretty short even for a $10 indie. I'm a lover of long games though, so maybe that's just me. I would still most definitely recommend it. Maybe wait for a sale if don't want to spend $10 for one day of gameplay. Awesome overall!			"

												A very good game. You're put into a world that is known as Limbo. There is very little development to the characters but in this game, its not needed. In the short time that I did play this game, I'm not sure Ive be came so invested in a video game. Would wait for a sale or something, as I got it when it was free, it was def worth my time.			"

												Limbo is basically a cinematic platform filled with great atmosphere, charming black and white art style, brutal death's animations and clever puzzles based on unexpected enviromental interactivity. The story is loose and understanding its meaning is left to the player's interpretation. A few collectibles and the crazy ""finish the game with 5 or less deaths"" achievement allow for some replay value. I have to say that this game isn't for everyone since it lacks of intense action and the genre is quite niche per se but it's surely worth a try			"

												I originally bought this game on Xbox Live Arcade the day it released and finished it that night with a friend. When I saw Limbo free on Steam a few weeks ago, I had to download it and play it again. Limbo is, in my opinion, a milestone in the puzzle-platformer genre that has yet to be surpassed. While it is only a few hours long, Limbo has made a bigger impact on me than most 60 dollar, AAA games.+ Great gameplay with fluid animations and interesting puzzles that grow gradually in difficulty.+ Minimalist story told through engaging imagery rather than words.+ Sound design on par with big budget titles, possibly better.+ Art direction that is disturbingly beautiful.I look forward to playing ""Inside"",  Playdead's follow-up to this game.

												What if Stephen King had made Super Mario Bros. while on a paranoid acid trip right after watching the movie: Arachniphobia? Well that would be LIMBO.

Bring spare underwear. You WILL die in this game... a lot, but it never punishes you with lengthy respawn times and it is always slightly amusing to watch him die in new and vicerally creative ways.

												Initially I thought a game that was made in black and white would be too dreary and monotone to hold my attention for very long.  However the dark, atmospheric environments combined with the grainy light effects creates a really engrossing 2d world.  The subtle use of sound, with little to no music, adds to the eeriness of the game.  There were times where the music would kick in towards the end of a chapter/zone and make me wish that it played for most of the game.  Some of the levels, especially those that took a while to solve, got a little bare for me and I think music would've added quite a bit. The game is very minimilast in general.  There are direction keys and an interact button.  Its strictly linear, and there is really nothing to explore.  The game consists of chapters, each of which take place in the same environment with similar puzzle physics.  The first half of the game containst mostly creatures and other enemies, while the second half seemed to only have puzzles.  The real challening puzzles probably didn't kick in until the last hour or two.  And I almost wish there were zone bosses or something bigger that you were progressing to, other than different puzzles.So shortly after playing the game I had one major complaint, and that was rooted in the games minimilast style.  I've never been a fan of games or movies where the player or viewer is supposed to create their own story through imagination.  I have no problem when open-endeness adds to the story or create conversation.  For example, the spinning top at the end of Inception adds to the movie, the film doesn't depend on it.  But when your game or movie has a wide open gap that is supposedly intended for you to supplement with your own version, I think its just lazy or an excuse for poor writing.But, after thinking about it, the game is certainly catered to be more episodic.  It's not intended to be completed in 1-2 sittings like I did (4 hours total).  There is no plot or characters for you to worry about. There is a minimal story to hang the framework of the game on, and the rest is just fun, atmospheric puzzles to explore zone to zone.  And in this way it succeeds.I would almost recommend you purchase it on iOS than PC, or at least plan to play it in short sittings. I believe I got it on sale but even for $10 you get your mon			"

												Think of all the games that LIMBO inspired both visually and when it comes to gameplay. There is a reason behind that: LIMBO is amazing. Its puzzles are simple but clever and never cross the line of sensibility. The world is quite spooky, almost nightmarish and makes a great contrast to the feeling of the childhood innocence that the main character's appearance and movement implies. A total indie gem and a leader of its generation. 10/10			"

												LIMBO is a very unique game. It's unsettling, but in a good way. It feels like there's something just WAITING to jumpscare you, however, there isn't. which I find creepier than jumpscares, another example of a Horror, but not really game is ""Gone Home"" (which isn't as good as this one) Even though i haven't finished, this game just DESERVED a good review. the death scenes are very creative, Also, You're not given a story, you make your own story. Some of the puzzles can be...a little...very...EXTREMLY...Rage-inducing. But in a good way! Because when you DO complete a puzzle, the feeling is better than an easy puzzle game.  Personally, i recommend ""Limbo Video WalkthroughBy Singularity"" If you get stuck, and it's usually the first guide. here's the link:

												This is a great game. Basically, its exactly as the game description states: 'Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters LIMBO'. You start in LIMBO, and straight from the off, there are puzzles galore. The little character that you're controlling is good fun, and sound's play a big part. Also, you'll probably become hesitant at certain things, after you die so many times.But its still good in that respect.At some points, I was losing my mind, trying desperatly to get to the next part, but carry on, and you'll be so pleased when you get past it.Overall, a great game. Created a Let's Play, which only just started to release, but I loved it a lot. Recommended to anyone!!Here a short 5min review as well:

												LIMBO is a puzzle-platformer that raises many questions. But it is not gameplay related, it is rather yourself starting to wonder these thoughts: Who is this nameless boy?Where is he?Why is he here?What is going on here?!The story is awfully vague, only saying ""Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters LIMBO"". There's not much telling where he has gone to to come to said place..or -what- he has done...or worse, what -might- have happened to him.Or his sister.The controls are very responsive and smooth, and smooth fits the animation work of everything in the game. The game has a touch of realism, where you'll die if you jump off from too great heights for example. He is a resilent individual, not making a single human noise from himself, but you'll hear plenty of other sounds like those of sawblades decapitating him.The game has a very depressing color scheme being in black and white with all these horrific things that can happen to the boy. He can die some awfully brutal deaths such as impalement, crushed under and even get decapitated from giant beartraps. The puzzles are very clever thought and brings much variety, such as using the dead for your own good or even playing traffic light with a giant bug. At some points you're even challenged to survive a situation in where the majority of your freedom is taken away from you.The game itself can be called a trial and error game. For a first timer, it takes a few attempts before you realize what you are meant to do. For someone like me who knows what's coming, it teaches you that the game is very short (A speedrun with minimal casualties takes around an hour to complete from start to finish). For this reason, I recommend buying the game ONLY during sales and not otherwise.			"

												It doesnt matter if you are into jump n run or not, this game is a fricking masterpiece. Normally I wouldnt even mind writing a review because you should already know it anyway, but a friend of mine told me a few days ago, he didnt know it yet. If you havent played this game, do so now. You are welcome.The only reason I can think of for disliking it is the rather dark atmosphere. The game is cartooney, but while there is no gore or blood, you will still see your little hero die. A lot. Buzz saws, spikes, traps, giant spiders, you name it. The game is not difficult in terms of controls etc, you only use the arrow keys and Ctrl to grab stuff, pull levers, etc.But. it. will. screw. with. your. mind. (in a hilarious way)There is a checkpoint on every corner, so dont worry about getting frustrated. If you die, it is because you didnt know yet, or because you messed up and jumped off the cliff. The puzzles are clever and original and solving them is - while not too hard - very rewarding.If you still have doubts, there is a free demo somewhere, but seriously, there is no need for that. I completed the game and I had a lot of fun watching my friends complete it about 4 or 5 times in total, last time yesterday, after owning it for over a year already. The only downside is that it is a one-time-only-experience, as you remember how the puzzles work after you completed them. Thats why I have so much fun watching others who do not know yet, try, fail, try again and laugh their♥♥♥♥♥off. :PGo play it. For your own sake. "

												Limbo is a great indie game. You are thrown into the game completely clueless about the plot and you are not briefed about the character's background, environment or any other aspect of the game. Throughout gameplay of Limbo, you follow along the experiences of a little boy in which you play as. You are presented with some challenging obstacles in which you learn many things from along with the character through your mistakes and the use of the method of trial and error. The game and levels are cleverly designed and though the obstacles are challenging to an extent, I have never found them to be overwhelmingly frustrating but in fact, I have found them to be rather enjoyable.The mood through the use of simple music and an unique artistic style involving dark monotonal colours is great at immersing the player into the scene. You begin to develop an attachment with character throughout the game.The physics/movement is applaudable, the character control is smooth and the controls are simple and easy to use.This game is an amazing piece of work. It is definitely worth the price. I have no regrets buying this game and I highly recommend this game to those considering to purchase and all of those who have not purchased this game. What are you waiting for?! :)			"

												This game is a stand out hit for me.It's haunting ambience and the tension it can seemingly provide within this deceitfully calm realm is incomparable with other games in it's genre.It's more than a curious platformer, it's a puzzler as well.All about a boy who is searching for his sister in the woods in the middle of the night, this game truly delivers.Yes the game has it's scares but I would mark this game as more of a suspenseful thriller than a horror game.Unless you're scared of spiders, then this game may scare the crap out of you.

												However much my playtime is is how long it took me to beat it on the first play through.  Maybe 2.5 or so?  It's a fun 2d puzzle solving game.  I got it for $2.50 or so on sale, for that price I'd recommend picking it up. Very simple.  Arrows keys to move, control is your action button.  Some people on the forums like to post how fast they made it through, but it's kind of a one and done for me.			"

												My feelings on Limbo are conflicted. On the one hand, I feel that the game overall is quite good. The puzzles are well done and the game is fairly entertaining throughout, but I also feel there are a few issues that hold the game back.	My first major gripe with the game is its minimalist story. The game is supposed to be about a boy trying to find his sister, but the game just begins with you waking up in a field and then progressing along a 2D plane. There is no introduction as to who you are or why you are here. One could argue that this leaves the player to create his or her own story, and normally that would be ok, but the game gives you absolutely nothing to base your thoughts on. The only reason I knew the game was supposed to be about finding the boy’s sister is because the description on Steam says so. If you want to leave interpretation up to the player, that is fine, but at least give them something to go off of. I have no context as to why I’m going through these trials or why there are people/creatures trying to kill me. It feels frustrating to me as a player because I want some context. The setting for this game is fantastic and I would love to know more about it, but the game offers no explanation.	On a somewhat related note, the game offers nothing in the way of instruction, either. Not even at the very beginning of the game. To find out the controls, you have to open the pause menu and check them out yourself. There is a growing complaint that video games hold the player’s hand too much, but this game does the exact opposite. You basically have to find out everything yourself as you go. For me, this lead to some frustrating moments where the solution to a puzzle was pretty simple, but I missed it for so long because I didn’t know I could move that object etc. The protagonist does move his arm a bit when he is in range of something he can touch, but that does not show up when running. As a result, you may run past the solution to a puzzle a few times before finally getting it. 	My final gripe with the game is its use of trial and error. On your first playthrough of this game, you will find yourself dying… a lot. The game uses trial and error as the primary means of solving puzzles. You’ll often find yourself dying to things that you didn’t know could kill you. The player is forced to run through things and die several times before he can fully understand how things work. This can get pretty frustrating after a short amount of time. These deaths feel cheap and unfair. Deaths should serve to punish the player when he makes a mistake. Instead, there is a sense that there is no way to get through the game without dying unless you know exactly what is going to happen and where it will happen.	All that being said, the game is still deserving of praise. First and foremost, the art style in this game is fantastic. The usage of black and white is incredibly well done and creates an interesting world that is fairly grim. It fits the game world which is hostile and brimming with evil. Using a limited color palette, the developers create a world that is surprisingly engrossing. It is easy to get lost in the game as you walk around and wonder what these places are and who (or what) lives there. 	Additionally, the puzzles are pretty solid as well. I’m not exactly a puzzle game buff by any means, but I found the difficulty to be reasonable (barring one or two exceptions). They are complex enough to require some thought, but not too complex for the average player. I was able to solve most of them after some critical thinking. This area does suffer a bit from the game’s minimalistic approach though. The exceptions I refer to are frustrating because it usually involved doing something that I had no idea I could. The lack of any indication left me scratching my head until I got so frustrated I had to consult a guide. 	Finally, the art style is awesome. The world is portrayed as fairly negative and hostile, and a simple black and white color scheme really helps convey that. It’s another factor that helps immerse the player in the world of the game. The contrast between light and dark has some interesting elements, and are even used in puzzle solving a bit. 	Overall, I’d say that, despite the problems I found in the game, it was a quite enjoyable experience. I dwell so much on those negative aspects, but I feel that they hold the game back from truly being a masterpiece. It has so much potential, and I just wish the developers would have done things just a bit differently. That would have taken the game from “great” to “fantastic.” 4/5			"

												An existencial crisis in the form a puzzle platformer. You have basic control over your character, who feels heavy and hard to control in order to make your movements more precise, and you must solve different situations that block your progress towards the right of the screen. The story is vague, but it's definitely realted to some sibling quarel in the afterlife.

Review Limbo (German/Broken English)Ein kleiner Junge in einer einfachen und ausreichenden schwarz-weiß Grafiklandschaft, der seine Wege mit wirklich sehr angenehmer und leichter Steuerung geht. Durch die verschiedenen Ebenen der Grafiken erhält es eine schöne Umgebungsdynamik, die mich sofort verschlungen hat. Er spaziert durch die verschiedensten und teilweise sehr kniffligen Rätsel. Ein oder Zwei Abschnitte können sehr den Durchhaltewillen fordern, jedoch wie ich die Lösung herausgefunden hatte, war ich super happy. Obwohl ich das Spiel wirklich zu 100% empfehlen möchte, gibt es einen Punkt der mich gestört hat. Es gibt keine Musik, die das Spiel noch mehr untermalt und noch spannender gemacht hätte. (Ich habe die Gamemusik von HackNet nebenbei laufen gehabt – war auch passend). Die Töne und Sounds die im Spiel hörbar sind, sind sehr leise und dann gibt es Momente wo es um sehr viel lauter ist. Abgesehen von Sound und Musik ist es ein TOP Game und bin froh es in meiner Bibliothek zu haben und kann es wirklich sehr empfehlen, wenn dir knifflige Rätseln gefallen.Pro/Kontra Liste+ Einfache Steuerung+ Spannende und knifflige Rätseln+ Grafik im schwarz-weiß Stil wundervoll umgesetzt+ Spielspaß bleibt (fast) durchgehend- Keine Ingame MusikA little boy in a simple and sufficient black and white graphic scenery. He goes his ways with really very pleasant and easier control. The different levels of graphics make a nice environment dynamic that has swallowed me up immediately. He walks through the most diverse and sometimes very tricky puzzles. One or two sections can be very demanding to perseverance, however, as I had found the solution, I was super happy. Although I would really recommend the game to 100%, there is a point of bothered me. There is no music in the game. That's a shame. With music, the game would have made even more exciting. (I have heard the game music of HackNet - was also suitable). The tones and sounds that can be heard in the game, are very quiet. At other times the sound effects are too loud. Apart from sound and music, it is a good game and I am glad to have it in my library and can really recommend it if you like tricky puzzles.Pro / Contra List+ Easy control+ Exciting and challenging puzzles+ Wonderfully graphics in black and white style + Game enjoyment remains continuously (almost)- No Game music "

												Limbo, the game, is special in that while it does not wholly depict that mysterious dimension as my mind did, it captures its essence. You are a boy who wakes up in a lonely world made up only of black, white, and shades of gray. Video game logic demands you walk from left to right, jumping over obstacles as they appear, a simple task that needs little attention in the initial moments. This is your chance to absorb your surroundings. The background provides an illusion of depth, but its branches and bridges are out of focus, as if you are dreaming them into existence. The pint-sized hero, his bright blinking eyes shining from his blackened silhouette, trots ahead with the charming gangliness of a six-year-old.Pros :- Striking atmosphere that chills the heart- Excellent, poignant moments that stay with you- Cold, gruesome deaths are presented with memorable and horrific apathy- Introduces more involved puzzles at a satisfying paceCons :- The most haunting imagery is limited to the first half- Ending doesn't emerge organically from the hour leading to itSummary :Limbo is an incredible achievement. Very few games are as original, atmospheric, and consistently brilliant. It belongs in everybody's collection. The journey may be over too quickly, but you will be entertained every minute. This is one of my favorite games. I give it a 8/10.			"

												The game is very atmospheric and the puzzles are good and challeging. However, some of the puzzles don't lend themselves to the game very well in that sometimes you need to piece together things through assumptions rather than JUST analyzing things in the map/world. I guess Darksiders has spoiled me a little bit in that regard.Otherwise, i'd give this game an 8.5/10. It deserves a little more than just a solid 8 you know.			"

												I got this game while it was free, so I can't exactly comment on if it's worth full price.It's an amazing game though, with a vague but interesting... story? It doesn't tell you much, but that's the beauty, personally. The difficulty curve is comfortable, with the beginning puzzles very easy, and the last few taking some real thought and effort. There's no unique gameplay mechanic, but I was sucked into the game world, and that's, I think, what the real unique selling point of this game is. It's very immersive, and it's atmosphere is incredible.I don't think the gameplay is perfect, but Limbo makes up for it with (somtimes disturbing) immersion.			"

												So... how to start...They made this game very good and i really enjoyed it, but there are some things i dont like. 1st: (warning - spoiler of beggining part) I dont know how to describe it, so i will use one part of the game.There is a huge spider, if u wont kill him, you cant go through the game. You need to kill the spider with trap, which is on ther tree and you cant pick it. I think, you just cant know, that you need the spider to ,,knock"" the ground, when he tries to kill you, and this will make little earthquake or how to call it, and the trap will fall. Things like this, when you cant know what to do, because it doesnt make a sense are in this game, but i didnt notice so much that it can make the game boring.2nd: The game is in the middle part stereotype and it isnt about logic, its like that you know what to do, but you need more tries to make it, and this repeates. So this part of game is quite about luck. So... I recommend this game, how i said, i really enjoyed it - especially the ending part, which is i think really hard and you need nice timing. And, i got this game for free, so i am happy :D But i think it is worth the 10 e you need to spend, and hunting achievements is nice too.			"

												Minimal graphics and a subtle sound track make for tremendous atmosphere. It is MUCH more fun and interesting than I had expected. The physics made every death hilarious, so even dying is amusing and forgivable. The puzzles got pretty tricky in spots. Very clever game. The ending might make some people crazy, but I thought it was impactful. It brought home the meaning of the title. That being said, I was pretty disappointed that it was sooo short. I guess that is to be expected, but I felt it was pretty short even for a $10 indie. I'm a lover of long games though, so maybe that's just me. I would still most definitely recommend it. Maybe wait for a sale if don't want to spend $10 for one day of gameplay. Awesome overall!			"

												Creative and fun 2D puzzle platformer that is hard to stop playing.  The dark but cartoonish style to the game makes it appealing for a wide variety of game preferences.

												Limbo is a decent puzzle game that starts simple but gets slightly harder towards the end. It has a nice/creepy atmosphere and the art feels unique (even though it is black and white only).Most of the times the puzzles rely on timing rather than thought so be prepared for some trial and error before progressing further.There is no actual story and the game can be finished within 3 hours on average, which doesn't justify the 10€ price tag.Personally, I got this game during sales with a -80% discount (for 1.99€) so that was a good deal.Overall, it is a well-made and pleasant experience for a cold or rainy afternoon while you enjoy your tea/coffee.I would recommend to put this game on your wishlist and buy it only when it goes on discount again because the short duration and lack of replayability does not justify the 10€ price tag.

												Initially I thought a game that was made in black and white would be too dreary and monotone to hold my attention for very long.  However the dark, atmospheric environments combined with the grainy light effects creates a really engrossing 2d world.  The subtle use of sound, with little to no music, adds to the eeriness of the game.  There were times where the music would kick in towards the end of a chapter/zone and make me wish that it played for most of the game.  Some of the levels, especially those that took a while to solve, got a little bare for me and I think music would've added quite a bit. The game is very minimilast in general.  There are direction keys and an interact button.  Its strictly linear, and there is really nothing to explore.  The game consists of chapters, each of which take place in the same environment with similar puzzle physics.  The first half of the game containst mostly creatures and other enemies, while the second half seemed to only have puzzles.  The real challening puzzles probably didn't kick in until the last hour or two.  And I almost wish there were zone bosses or something bigger that you were progressing to, other than different puzzles.So shortly after playing the game I had one major complaint, and that was rooted in the games minimilast style.  I've never been a fan of games or movies where the player or viewer is supposed to create their own story through imagination.  I have no problem when open-endeness adds to the story or create conversation.  For example, the spinning top at the end of Inception adds to the movie, the film doesn't depend on it.  But when your game or movie has a wide open gap that is supposedly intended for you to supplement with your own version, I think its just lazy or an excuse for poor writing.But, after thinking about it, the game is certainly catered to be more episodic.  It's not intended to be completed in 1-2 sittings like I did (4 hours total).  There is no plot or characters for you to worry about. There is a minimal story to hang the framework of the game on, and the rest is just fun, atmospheric puzzles to explore zone to zone.  And in this way it succeeds.I would almost recommend you purchase it on iOS than PC, or at least plan to play it in short sittings. I believe I got it on sale but even for $10 you get your mon			"

												LIMBO is an idie puzzle platformer that is very reminiscent of ""Heart of Darkness"" with its learn-from-your-deaths game mechanic. The game is designed completely in grayscale, and completely devoid of any music; with only the sound effects of the world around you, this all lends itself to a very creepy atmosphere. The puzzles and collectibles themselves are relatively challenging, and gaining all of the achievements makes it even more so.However, for as much as I enjoyed the game, I feel like $9.99 is a little steep.

Things like this, when you cant know what to do, because it doesnt make a sense are in this game, but i didnt notice so much that it can make the game boring.2nd: The game is in the middle part stereotype and it isnt about logic, its like that you know what to do, but you need more tries to make it, and this repeates. So this part of game is quite about luck. So... I recommend this game, how i said, i really enjoyed it - especially the ending part, which is i think really hard and you need nice timing. And, i got this game for free, so i am happy :D But i think it is worth the 10 e you need to spend, and hunting achievements is nice too.			"

												LIMBO is a very unique game. It's unsettling, but in a good way. It feels like there's something just WAITING to jumpscare you, however, there isn't. which I find creepier than jumpscares, another example of a Horror, but not really game is ""Gone Home"" (which isn't as good as this one) Even though i haven't finished, this game just DESERVED a good review. the death scenes are very creative, Also, You're not given a story, you make your own story. Some of the puzzles can be...a little...very...EXTREMLY...Rage-inducing. But in a good way! Because when you DO complete a puzzle, the feeling is better than an easy puzzle game.  Personally, i recommend ""Limbo Video WalkthroughBy Singularity"" If you get stuck, and it's usually the first guide. here's the link:

												Dark, Atmospheric, and grim.There are also puzzles involved that are fairly good and can get that moment of epiphany that people that likes puzzle games enjoy. Although the puzzles aren't really the strongest point of the game.Its about a little boy in a dark world where almost everything wants to kill him. But don't worry, he probably deserves it seeing as he is also a cold-blooded killer.Basically, its very enjoyable with great mood, tone, decent puzzles, very nice physics and the whole setting has elements of being interesting. Short and sweet (sorta) and worth the money.			"

												Simple and brilliant. The result of game + art. Game mechanics is great and it's mood quite unique. Puzzles are quite easy but since mistakes often means death and restart, that's a good thing, to avoid them into become annoying. Checkpoints are well and often placed. It somehow reminded me of ""Out Of This World"" wich is a game I loved. Game sound is also amazing, focused on details and ambience with no music, making it's dark mood even more creepy. The weakest point is the game lenght... quite short... they could've made the game a little bigger, with harder puzzles near the end, but for 10 bucks it's more than worth it.			"

Summary:A classic example of a short indie project being shot into the limelight, this dark and compelling tale puts you in control of a vulnerable young boy in a mysterious and dangerous world, searching for your sister. Chilling ambience and clever visual storytelling make this 2D sidescrolling puzzle-platformer a must-have. You will die a lot.Rating:1 - A masterpiece. An essential purchase for everyone.2 - Great game. Highly recommended to most people.3 - Fairly good game. Recommended mainly for fans of the genre or when on sale.4 - Poor game. Not recommended but has a few merits.5 - Awful game. Would not recommend to anyone in their right minds.			"

												It doesnt matter if you are into jump n run or not, this game is a fricking masterpiece. Normally I wouldnt even mind writing a review because you should already know it anyway, but a friend of mine told me a few days ago, he didnt know it yet. If you havent played this game, do so now. You are welcome.The only reason I can think of for disliking it is the rather dark atmosphere. The game is cartooney, but while there is no gore or blood, you will still see your little hero die. A lot. Buzz saws, spikes, traps, giant spiders, you name it. The game is not difficult in terms of controls etc, you only use the arrow keys and Ctrl to grab stuff, pull levers, etc.But. it. will. screw. with. your. mind. (in a hilarious way)There is a checkpoint on every corner, so dont worry about getting frustrated. If you die, it is because you didnt know yet, or because you messed up and jumped off the cliff. The puzzles are clever and original and solving them is - while not too hard - very rewarding.If you still have doubts, there is a free demo somewhere, but seriously, there is no need for that. I completed the game and I had a lot of fun watching my friends complete it about 4 or 5 times in total, last time yesterday, after owning it for over a year already. The only downside is that it is a one-time-only-experience, as you remember how the puzzles work after you completed them. Thats why I have so much fun watching others who do not know yet, try, fail, try again and laugh their♥♥♥♥♥off. :PGo play it. For your own sake. "

												However much my playtime is is how long it took me to beat it on the first play through.  Maybe 2.5 or so?  It's a fun 2d puzzle solving game.  I got it for $2.50 or so on sale, for that price I'd recommend picking it up. Very simple.  Arrows keys to move, control is your action button.  Some people on the forums like to post how fast they made it through, but it's kind of a one and done for me.			"

												Limbo is a beautiful, atmospheric puzzle platformer with a hard edge. What story it has is largely implicit—the game contains no dialogue. You simply wake in a dark wood, apparently a child, and set off to explore the dingy place in which you find yourself. But the genre of the game is certainly horror, though without most of the usual tropes. You are fragile—easily hurt, unable to swim, essentially defenseless—in a hostile and trap-ridden place. You will die many times. And the game does not divert your gaze from your death but rather renders each different mode of your demise in somewhat disturbing detail. The artistic style of the game simultaneously keeps this from being too macabre and contributes greatly to the eerie atmosphere. The game's graphics are entirely silhouettes in shades of grey. Yet the landscapes and objects feel very detailed. Beautifully done lighting effects give the impression of a layered world mostly in shadow. All this makes for a beautiful noir environment well worth admiration in its own right. This game is more immersive with black and white outlines than much I’ve played that had expensive 3D-graphics.A subtler strength of the game is the way its physics feel naturalistic—you are acutely aware of the weight of objects and the force of gravity.  I doubt that the game’s engine is particularly remarkable in this regard, it’s an aesthetic effect. Great attention has been paid to the visual details of motion. But I think it also comes from player movement: in many games you play as a character with outsized physical capabilities. Even in shooters and platformers where such isn’t part of the story your movements are subtly superhuman (think of the lateral jumping featured in most platformers). Not here. Here you have a painfully tiny lateral jump and a rather slow top speed. Here objects don’t just slide easily into place but are dragged only with great effort.The largest complaint I had with LIMBO was that it was too short. Though the puzzles were good, and admirably varied, not too many were very difficult. If one is adept at this sort of thing one could easily complete the game in just a few hours. They are an excellent few hours though. The puzzles are crisp, things to be grasped, not just fiddled with. For a little while LIMBO takes you to an unsettling, engrossing otherworld. And I’d very much like to visit again.			"

												I originally bought this game on Xbox Live Arcade the day it released and finished it that night with a friend. When I saw Limbo free on Steam a few weeks ago, I had to download it and play it again. Limbo is, in my opinion, a milestone in the puzzle-platformer genre that has yet to be surpassed. While it is only a few hours long, Limbo has made a bigger impact on me than most 60 dollar, AAA games.+ Great gameplay with fluid animations and interesting puzzles that grow gradually in difficulty.+ Minimalist story told through engaging imagery rather than words.+ Sound design on par with big budget titles, possibly better.+ Art direction that is disturbingly beautiful.I look forward to playing ""Inside"",  Playdead's follow-up to this game.

												This game is for everyone, not just platformer fans. I am not particularly fond of platformers. I found games like Ori quite frustrating, albeit visually pleasing. But Limbo is very intuitive, simple and yet challenging. It also achieves the mysterious atmosphere it is aiming for. The lenght of the game is just right, and welcomes replayability. A great way to spend an evening.			"

												When I first saw this game, my friend gave me controller and said ""there you go"".At first, you usually get some instructions, but no, not this time. So I've just mashed buttons and there it was! A boy in darkness! Since I first saw something like this, game was really tough for me, it was interesting and scary at the same time.That was my first encounter with game and than I waited for it to be available for PC and there you go!My rate 10/10Great graphics, minimal, but greatGreat gameplay, great story, lots of thinking, lots of fun and of course, tots of scary stuff			"

												I got this game while it was free, so I can't exactly comment on if it's worth full price.It's an amazing game though, with a vague but interesting... story? It doesn't tell you much, but that's the beauty, personally. The difficulty curve is comfortable, with the beginning puzzles very easy, and the last few taking some real thought and effort. There's no unique gameplay mechanic, but I was sucked into the game world, and that's, I think, what the real unique selling point of this game is. It's very immersive, and it's atmosphere is incredible.I don't think the gameplay is perfect, but Limbo makes up for it with (somtimes disturbing) immersion.			"

												The game is very atmospheric and the puzzles are good and challeging. However, some of the puzzles don't lend themselves to the game very well in that sometimes you need to piece together things through assumptions rather than JUST analyzing things in the map/world. I guess Darksiders has spoiled me a little bit in that regard.Otherwise, i'd give this game an 8.5/10. It deserves a little more than just a solid 8 you know.			"

												Limbo is a physics based puzzle platformer, but a first glance at it casts a message as a game full of grim and creepy images. This isn’t a horror game at all as this game is focused on platforming and solving physics puzzles, but Limbo has a distinctly dark atmosphere that suits the style and theme when playing through.There isn’t too much in terms of story. A boy wakes up in a forest, and as the game description states, tries to find his sister. There is no dialogue at all in the game, as the only things that expand on this story are the various interactions with other people and creatures as you keep moving forward in each level. The story does get resolved later on, though that is something that will be revealed along the way as the game continues.As a platformer game, the boy that you control doesn’t have much in terms of abilities. All the boy can do is walk, jump, and perform actions on other objects. As the game progresses, new level objects come in to play with different game mechanics to utilize. In the beginning, most puzzles tend to be simple platforming challenges. Later on, more difficult physics puzzles start to appear, requiring some puzzle solving compared to the easy solutions in the beginning. Toward the end, the puzzles are much harder and more involved, also requiring some good timing as well. Throughout the game, trial and error is a core aspect of solving the puzzles. You can definitely get away by being observant and thinking about each puzzle logically, but the harder puzzles require jumping into hazards to see what things do or to get a clue on how to solve the puzzle. The difficulty starts out quite easy, and becomes quite tough near the end of the game that the puzzles require some thought and coordination. Limbo’s simple platforming gameplay gives way for the interesting and well crafted physics puzzles, which require some deaths to successfully complete each puzzle.The art style for Limbo is one of the biggest motivators for the general tone of the game. The entire game is done like a black and white movie, complete with some film grain and blur to enhance the effect. The 2D design of the world though is quite beautiful in a way, with black silhouettes against gray shaded backgrounds. There is plenty of detail with the background scenery having softer blurred designs while the game objects sport hard, yet rounded shapes. This black and white style does heighten the creepy nature of the game a bit, evoking a feeling like watching old horror movies.The grim, grisly nature of Limbo is evident throughout the game, with many things hiding until they pop out to kill the boy. Early deaths are quite gory and violent, with the boy being dismembered or mauled in several ways. These things work well with the black and white style by simplifying details while still capturing the harshness of the world. These bloody deaths actually happen less later in the game, as more focus shifts on to the puzzles set in a more isolated man made environment. Overall, the dark style of the game works well with the art style for a creepy and bleak world.Keeping in tune with the dark themes of the game, there are no distinct songs in Limbo. Instead, the game uses an ambient soundtrack that heightens the mood and conveys game information. The sounds of each environment sets the backdrop and the tone, while subtle changes in the music sends a message of what is happening in the game. In addition to the ambient soundtrack adding so much in terms of tone and gameplay, the sound design is very well done. The sounds for the hazards sound distinct from the music which helps players recognize obstacles, while the sounds for deaths sound quite gruesome. With the ambient music and well designed sounds, the eerie atmosphere of the game is heighted more as each action unfolds.With heavy dark and grim tones, Limbo delivers some fun and somewhat challenging puzzle platforming wrapped up with a unique style. Each of the various aspects of the game work together to deliver this kind of foreboding atmosphere. As the game’s style is draws you in, the gameplay smoothly runs through the world with difficulty arising later on. Limbo works as a great experience of a game, both in the style it achieves, and the puzzle platforming gameplay that offers some good challenge with its crafty levels.			"

												Unnerving and yet so beautiful. This game gave me chills, made me rage, and yet, in the end, brought me to tears. With no instruction, you are to survive grim puzzles with accuracy and, for me, luck. Most puzzles start out with a few gruesome deaths before you find a solution. This game is fantastic as an experience, but has no replay value. Aside from that, the puzzles are creative and the gameplay is interesting. 7 spider legs out of 8.			"

												I bought Limbo when it was on sale like maybe a year ago and didnt play it too much because, as its always, there were many other games to play, but the first thing i can say, is that the game is worth every cent, even if you buy it for 10 Dollar or whatever. Limbo has on of the best and most scary atmospheres in indie games i've ever seen. Although it's only 2D and you don't get to know the boy really well, you learn to feel his feelings and fear his fears, like huge and gross monster-spiders and stuff like this. Furthermore, it's has some nice puzzle elements, which makes it one of the best indie games i've played so far.So as a conclusion, i strongly recommend the game to everyone who likes games with great atmospheres and puzzle elements.

If you like this game even a little bit I highly reccomend the second game from the developers INSIDE. Even more beautiful and loads of fun puzzles - bit shorter than this one though. Remember to look for the achievement eggs but let me tell you they are NOT easy to find or even get to once youve found them.  I've never enjoyed watching a little boy being murdered in horrendous circumstances so much. 10/10			"

												LIMBO is a puzzle-platformer that raises many questions. But it is not gameplay related, it is rather yourself starting to wonder these thoughts: Who is this nameless boy?Where is he?Why is he here?What is going on here?!The story is awfully vague, only saying ""Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters LIMBO"". There's not much telling where he has gone to to come to said place..or -what- he has done...or worse, what -might- have happened to him.Or his sister.The controls are very responsive and smooth, and smooth fits the animation work of everything in the game. The game has a touch of realism, where you'll die if you jump off from too great heights for example. He is a resilent individual, not making a single human noise from himself, but you'll hear plenty of other sounds like those of sawblades decapitating him.The game has a very depressing color scheme being in black and white with all these horrific things that can happen to the boy. He can die some awfully brutal deaths such as impalement, crushed under and even get decapitated from giant beartraps. The puzzles are very clever thought and brings much variety, such as using the dead for your own good or even playing traffic light with a giant bug. At some points you're even challenged to survive a situation in where the majority of your freedom is taken away from you.The game itself can be called a trial and error game. For a first timer, it takes a few attempts before you realize what you are meant to do. For someone like me who knows what's coming, it teaches you that the game is very short (A speedrun with minimal casualties takes around an hour to complete from start to finish). For this reason, I recommend buying the game ONLY during sales and not otherwise.			"

												Played for 7.2 hours.  I aged 7.2 years.  This game stressed me out but I kept playing.  I died 1000 deaths.  But it kept me coming back for more.  I was exhausted at the end and perhaps a bit unsettled and even angry at what I'd been through.  10/10  one of the best games I've ever played.			"

												A fairly fun puzzle-solving game with a creepy atmosphere.

												You know, I've been playing video games since I was a kid. In recent years though games went from being difficult and chellenging to rewarding you for taking a step out of your house and in this age of coddling and babying it's nice to see a game that isn't afraid to punch you in the face. Limbo is short but it's dark atmosphere and difficult platforming more than make up for it. This game takes me back to when I had to buckle down and sit through a game for hours. Like I said, the only drawback to this game is that it's so short.If anyone out there still enjoys good platforming I'd highly recommend it. A solid 7/10.			"

LIMBO is a masterpiece of platform games.  Title LIMBO   Developer Playdead   Publisher Playdead  Release 21 July 2010 for Xbox 360 (Xbox Live Marketplace), available on Steam in 2 August 2011  Graphics 2D   Genre Platform  Price €9,99  Rating 8/10 The game.LIMBO is a puzzle platformer indie game released in 2010. It was first released on the Xbox 360 in 2010, before moving to the PlayStation and PC in 2011, it latter got another port to PlayStation Vita and iOS, and yet another one onto the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.A memorable game. LIMBO demonstrates that a game is not all about crazy graphics or well produced story line. It's hard to classify it: it's a platformer, but it will rarely require good timing; it's a puzzle game, but you won't spend hours trying to figure out solutions; it's a horror game, but there's no blood, no jumpscare, not even fear, just a disturbing atmosphere.Gameplay.You’re a boy who wakes up in a lonely world made up only of black, white, and shades of gray. Video game logic demands you walk from left to right, jumping over obstacles as they appear, a simple task that needs little attention in the initial moments. This is your chance to absorb your surroundings. The background provides an illusion of depth, but its branches and bridges are out of focus, as if you are dreaming them into existence. The pint-sized hero, his bright blinking eyes shining from his blackened silhouette, trots ahead with the charming gangliness of a six-year-old.Then comes death. Limbo is a hostile place, home to giant spiders that would feast upon you, and traps apparently scattered by the world's other denizens. You step onto a claw trap, and it closes on your neck. Your head falls to the ground and wobbles just for a moment before lying still. No tears are shed, no music plays. The game provides no grand gesture to honor your demise. It simply happens, and you revive at the most recent checkpoint to try the puzzle again. Some of these deaths aren't outright fair; stepping on a pressure plate could mean certain death, but so could jumping over it. Such inconsistencies aren't common, but your first time in Limbo requires some trial-and-error experimentation. Loading times are short, and checkpoints are frequent, however, so death is rarely a frustration, though often a horror.I had heard a lot about this game and it don’t disappoint me. I bought it in winter sale 2016 for €1,99. I don't hesitate. This black-and-white 2D puzzle platformer is one of the best games you'll play on any platform. It’s, for sure, one of the best physics puzzle games out there. A clever game. And a good Christmas present.Pros. (+)(+) PresentationThis game establishes a strong connection with the player despite the lack of story, dialogue, text, or explanation.(+) GraphicsYou've never seen anything quite like this. The black and white visuals make everything creepier and the animation is very smooth.(+) SoundNot only do the eerie sound effects set the mood, you often have to listen carefully for clues to solve puzzles.(+) GameplayThe trial-and-death gameplay avoids being frustrating. LIMBO always has a surprise waiting for you around the next corner.(+) Lasting appealIs a fairly short game that might take around 4-6 hours to finish, but you’ll enjoy every minute of it. Finding every hiddden achievement will take a while.Cons. (-)None.Review Edition:When I did this review I still hadn't completed the ""DING achievement"" and it's extremely insane, very, very difficult - I died 20/25 times to do it. The achievement of ""dying 5x or less throughout the game"", to me, is unthinkable.Definitely recommended. LIMBO is a masterpiece.			"

												What a haunting, melancholy experience...To me, this is the type of game that helps define video games as art.In the simplest of terms, Limbo is a platforming puzzle game. Moving ever forward, the player is confronted with puzzle after puzzle, some requiring pure reflex and careful jumping, others requiring a more thoughtful approach. Regardless of whether the player is manipulating objects in the environment or simply dodging lethal terrain, the difficulty in Limbo feels organic and fair. There are moments that are more challenging than others, but having just finished it, I can say that all of the puzzles have a simple solution.But it's so much more than just the puzzles that Limbo has to offer. It's in its very name: Limbo. A space between reality and dream. A stasis between life and death. In its hazy monochromatic fog, Limbo leads the player through surreal and nightmarish landscapes. Why? Piecing together and creating the story for ones self is what makes Limbo so enthralling, at least to me. Very little is given, and for a generation of games that spoon-feed their players and hold them by the hand, the stark ambiguity of Limbo is absolutely refreshing.I won't share my interpretations of the story/ending. In some ways, I feel that it's all very obvious, as long as you're observant. In the end, do I recommend Limbo? Yes. If your taste is bombastic colors and sound, however, you'll find yourself disappointed. For anyone else interested in a title that encourages you to think: this is your game.			"

												Haunting and difficult but not always fulfilling. Limbo is a a challenging platformer in a drab grayscale world, A boy ventures his way through various puzzles and jumps to his final destination. The player progresses through different areas, meeting few inhabitants, in a story that is without words. The visuals and complimentary music create an atmosphere of dread, adventure, and uncertainty. Despite the lack of color, deaths are fairly graphic.The game, though charitable with auto-saving, is not without its frustrations. The controls feel slightly delayed and in game physics in regards to manipulating objects can be difficult to predict. Most irksome is the inevitable failures resulting in drawn-out deaths. I found one jump particularly vexing, and when I missed it, instead of being able to reset\ to the previous check point, I had to wait for my inevitable death, then wait for the death animation before finally restarting (i counted 20 seconds of waiting). 15 attempts later an you realized a single jump just took 8 minutes to complete. I appreciate the aesthetic and some of the challenges but felt kinda meh about the whole thing when I was done. I would give it a lukewarm recommendation			"

												I have seen this game for many years now and finaly got the chance to play it, and man did it scare the f*** outta me at some parts, if your looking for a puzzle game, you've come to the right place! If your NOT looking for a horror game, then man up! As 2spooky5me as this game is, its has great original gameplay, designs, and mechanics that will leave you speechless when your soul gets stabbed by a spider leg! Spiders? Yup! Here comes that arachniphobia... Not so much of a soundtrack besides the ambient sounds in the back, but still leaves an impact on the game! Fair warning, if your not into dark, horror, suicide, or rotting flesh, you may want to have a garbage can nearby, your garbage can might need its own miniture garbage can too!For years now this game has still been on awards and recomended platformers, its truely one of the classics! So take a dare and go into LIMBO (pun intended but for real get this game)9/10 from me!			"

												Despite recommending it (because it's free and somewhat fun), I didn't really like it that much, mostly because the main cause of death in the game is the terrible controls.  You can't change them, and they are incredibly awkward.  95% of my deaths are from my character doing stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥I didn't intend because the controls are too ""loose.""  Space should be jump, and WASD for movement, like every other game, or at least give people the option to change the controls.  I wish I could get to the end but the part with the filling up the room with water to raise the crate is ♥♥♥♥ing impossible thanks to the awkward controls.  You can't get the crate to be close enough to the platform when it rises up to grab it and drag it left, or even if you do you lose your grip or the crate slides a bit too far or your character jumps unexpectedly.  Ugh.			"

												I finally gave Limbo a shot and I was not the least bit disappointed. The game throws you right into a unique atmosphere and doesn't let go until you see the credits roll. No joke, I caught myself talking to the game, laughing out loud and scratching my head more times than I can count. Short and sweet. 2 Thumbs Up.			"

												A very artistic game. The whole game is in black and white. The game doesn't take long to beat, maybe 1-2 hours. The achievements to this game can be hard at times to get but are fun to get at the same time. The game in ""Limbo"" and the goal of the game is to get out of it and figure out were you are? There are a lot of theories to this game and why things are the way they are Its a interesting story as you go along but keeps you wondering what is going on. The music in the game is great and kept you in the mood the whole time. The sounds in game are awesome and captivating as you traverse between each chapter instantaneously. The game is a indie game and is very well done and beautifully put together. I recommend this game to any Indie lover, and someone wanting to have an adventure that can open up your mind to what could have happened. It keeps you wondering even after you have beat it.			"

												The name Limbo is an honest introduction to this game as a whole.Like limbo, for its duration the game is enigmatic, undefinable, and otherworldly with black and white graphics and a film grain, everything in the game animated as black silhouettes against a dreary, lonely backdrop made of shifting shades of gray. It has minimalist but effective sound design, think drippy water and receding footsteps, or a few flies buzzing at you. It's not full on horror, but it's a beautiful and perfect feeling of dread, wandering and isolation, all quite poetic, which is why critics just sweet talked the pants off of it and made sweet love to it in their reviews.You'll like it mostly for these one-of-a-kind aesthetics more than for its pretty standard puzzle platforming - you might be disappointed if you are a 'gameplay first' type of hardcore indie gamer. The puzzles all come in the form of risky or deadly traps or mysterious enemies that you have to somehow negotiate or kill. This is as close as the game ever comes to horrific, with some panic of imminent death punctuating the usual thick melancholy.If you want a short, sweet game that, if played in a dark room with headphones will really suck you in, it's definitely worth it for half or 75% off (I grabbed it for $2.50). Expect to seriously use your imagination every few levels, because though there aren't many parts to the puzzles, their solutions are not always apparent, and this adds to the game's enigmatic feeling. Plenty of puzzles you just have to die through several times to understand, but there are a ton of checkpoints, and this trial and error is intended, so don't let it get to you.Now that I think of it, it makes sense that the development team is Danish. Its sensibility of *bleh* is very cold, very pretty, and very Scandinavian.			"

												I have seen this game for many years now and finaly got the chance to play it, and man did it scare the f*** outta me at some parts, if your looking for a puzzle game, you've come to the right place! If your NOT looking for a horror game, then man up! As 2spooky5me as this game is, its has great original gameplay, designs, and mechanics that will leave you speechless when your soul gets stabbed by a spider leg! Spiders? Yup! Here comes that arachniphobia... Not so much of a soundtrack besides the ambient sounds in the back, but still leaves an impact on the game! Fair warning, if your not into dark, horror, suicide, or rotting flesh, you may want to have a garbage can nearby, your garbage can might need its own miniture garbage can too!For years now this game has still been on awards and recomended platformers, its truely one of the classics! So take a dare and go into LIMBO (pun intended but for real get this game)9/10 from me!			"

												LIMBO is a creepy indie side scrolling puzzle platformer, where a little boy is looking for his sister.It doesn't require great jumping reflexes, or great puzzle skills, everything is fairly intuitive and fun to discover what comes next. The graphics are a quite creepy silhouette art style, the little boy's deaths are unsettling, he'll die often until you figure out the puzzle and get past the hazard. The ambient audio is atmospheric and suits the tone of the game.The game's bad points would be that it has low resolution and you can't redefine the control keys.LIMBO, watch my first impression video here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFQJljXjPog "

												Although it may not be important for some, I originally got this game after playing the PS3 demo hoping to add it to the list of low spec games playable on my netbook. Linux users please note that Limbo will not run on the GMA3150 included with most netbooks, and likely laptops or computers using the same on board graphics, even with OpenGL 2.1 support enabled.Nonetheless the game runs beautifully on my main computer. The puzzles in game are interesting, but not too complicated, making it a nice casual platformer. Checkpoints (or ""chapters"" in game) save after most puzzles, so if you die you never have to backtrack too far.Overall if you're looking for a casual platformer with a dark atmosphere, I'd highly recommend this game, albeit with the caveat that Linux users should be aware that it may not run at all on older hardware. For those who've played the demo and are wondering if the full version is much better, I can say that the game only gets more interesting once you've passed the demo section.			"

												Limbo is an interesting puzzle game, i'd say it found a good balance in its puzzle difficulty. Its approachable and easy enough but every once in a while hit me with something that kept me guessing. The gameplay progresses with varying hazards and abilities such as gravity and lasers. Its art style and lack of sound (music not effects) really gave it an atmosphere that i enjoyed.  The length of the game was a pleasant suprise too, something quality that is less than 10hours can be a struggle to find sometimes. A nice story told even with a lack of dialog and a really creepy spider interaction makes this a little gem of a game.			"

												Limbo is a simple 2D side-scrolling platforming game with a few puzzles near the end. There is no color, but only black and white which creates the tense and spooky atmosphere. The platforming and puzzles are creative and very fun. The game is short (~3 hours) but the adventure is worth it.			"

 ""Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters LIMBO..."" That's just it. No other information given. The story is vague, even after you finished it. And still,... got huge of recommendations with overwhelming positive reviews. How could that be possible?And here's what I though: Detailed Score: AspectScoreExplanationGameplay9.0Like other platformer games, in this game you have to finish the puzzles in order to advance to the next chapter. Actually, there is no clear distinction between each chapter in-game. You can see it, though at Load Chapter on main menu. The puzzle is quite easy at the beginning, but is getting more difficult in the mean of time. You'll have to die a lot just to discover the hint of the puzzle.For first walkthrough, it needs so much time (and a lot of headache) to finish this game. (I remember my first walkthrough and it needed days for me to complete it.)One little flaw (probably) of this game is the length of game. Especially for second walkthrough and more, the game can be finished for a couple of hours. It is more likely because much of chapter is quite short and the key to finish the puzzle is easily remembered once you have finished it before.World Design9.5""Hey, why would we have to discuss the world design here?""""Well, as a platformer game, it does a matter, right?""Okay, no matter how good the gameplay is, it's going to a waste when the world is poorly designed. Gladly, LIMBO is smart enough to avoid that problem. The world is mainly divided into three regions: forests, sub-urban cities, and mechanical factory. Each place has their own unique design, given the player to do the different approach to finish the puzzle in each regions.Not much more to say? Okay, to the next criteria.Story9This is where one of most unique aspects of LIMBO lies. You have no clue about what's really happened from the start (to the ending). All we know is our character, a boy, anonymous, wake up in the middle of forest, go through puzzles and puzzles, and finally meet your little sister.For some people, the story is very annoying given the lack of information about it. But, I love it. It give us the feel that the game ""don't guide us"". You are the player, you define the story, you define what's really happened. It's pretty unique way about how developer put their story.Graphic and Sound10The most remarkable aspect of LIMBO. Instead give us he player a full-detailed graphic, the developer gives us a grey-ish, silhouette world. You have to imagine about the world itself, what our character looks like, what those giant spiders look like, what those big chainsaw looks like, etc etc etc.Those big aspect of graphic become more immersive with the sound effect. I love how developer use minimalistic sound effect in their game. Sometimes they makes use calm. Sometimes, they gives us some kind of nightmare, take example of sound effect when you died because of chainsaw. (ugh...)Those two aspect are combined pretty well, and we have an immersive, dark, terrifying, and yet beautiful world. TL;DR LIMBO is a great example of what a game should be. Every aspect of this game is amazing, if you don’t want to call it perfect. A must-have for every platformer fans and common gamers alike.Some people say the price is a little bit high for a 3-5 hours of gameplay. For me, it’s worth every cent of your money. Score: 9.5/10  NB: I only spend less than 10 hours for this game when I reviewed this game. I’ll tell you, I have finished this game long time ago.  Well, at piracy. Forgive me!!!  But then, I still buy this game on Steam because I love this game so much. I want to give my support for the developer and I can’t wait for their upcoming projects in the future.  "

												I have no words how to describe that I have my feelings for LIMBO. This is so DEPRESSING to me just because the game is dark where boy search for his sister in Limbo but sadly in the end you'll get to know that they both are dead already! Sounds like I'm a spoiler but it's not. In game he enters in Limbo because his main purpose is to find her anyway. It's really dark-ish, outstanding atmospheric with sound which makes a game that engross. I do have a few questions with this game, the story is really not clear like; Why they are dead? What happened to them? What Spiders, Waters, Mosquito, Glasses, Gears and stuffs represents? And some of the puzzles are quite difficult giving you many deaths. This is an amazing game which becomes challenging everytime but not frustrating, this became my one of the favourite game in collection. I recommend you to buy this title on any platform and should play till the end.			"

												Exellent little game. It won't take too much you're time but it will give you moments of joy, excitement, anger, frustration and scare the hell out of you. Graphics style is really minimalistic and there is barely no music but instead there are many noises from the surroundings. It can feel impossible from time to time (yes, I had to cheat...) but most of the times solutions are clear if you listen or look carefully.			"

												If you like clever game design, intelligent horror, or well-realised artistry, you really have to  play through Limbo. It's an clean production, as close to perfect as it gets, and it will stay with you for a very long time. But please take my advice. Turn the lights off, get rid of all distractions and play it alone. Because Limbo deserves your full attention, and will reward it immensely from start to finish.8.5/10			"

												You play as a boy who is on a quest to find his sister for whatever unknown reason. You will face the trials of gaint spiders, ancient tribe warriors, gigantic saws and much more. All this takes place in a fluid black and white atmosphere with a soothing set of ambience in the background. However it is not without its flaws. I have two major complaints against this game, the first being that there is zero help whatsover on how to play this game. To learn the controls, I had to find which key opened the  main menu to open to the control manager. (For future players, this menu can be opened with the ""escape"" key and the controls on a standard keyboard are the arrow keys and the control key for interacting with an article. Also, when you are upside down, the jump key is the ""down"" button.) The second major issue with this game was the story. Except for the game's description, there is no way for the player to understand the story. Also, the end of the game was... open ended to say the least. I feel the developers could have done a better job explaing to the player what had happened to cause this ""limbo."" All in all, the game is great, but for ten dollars, I expect at the very least, a help section in the game's menu. GENRE TYPE: Puzzle/Action-AdeventureMUSIC: 2/5 - There wasn't much music involved with the game. A bit too quiet for my tastes. SOUND: 4/5 - Excellent job with the background noise. You hear everything from birds to the boy's breathing.STORY: 1/5 - This is the main issue here. The developers neglected to inform the players of the objective and the end result.PUZZLES: 4/5 - You should be able to figure them out yourself, but an optional hint system would have been appreciated. GRAPHICS: 5/5 - While monochrome, the game's fluid-like phsyics and detail makes the world pleasing to the eye.DIFFICULTY: 4/5 - Simple enough at first, but it gradually increases to a fairly moderate challenge in the end.OVERALL SCORE: 3.8/5 - Great job on physics and puzzles, but poor execution of main storyline.

												There has been much written about heaven and hell. The absolute paradise of the former and the absolute pain of the latter are some of only a small handful of human ideas that are immune to hyperbole; our mortal descriptions of such places will never be too much and of that we can be sure.But what about what lies between? The concept of purgatory is a much harder one to pin down. Thoughts on the concept, both lay and philosophical, have defined it as anything from a second mortal existence to an afterlife of absolute nothingness. If the title is to be believed, LIMBO ostensibly takes place in this in-between afterlife. It may not be hell, but it is a far cry from heaven.""Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters LIMBO."" This lone sentence is the closest thing to a synopsis that the creators have given us. How the boy got to limbo is unclear. Why you must press forward is unclear. But to stand still is to both promise and condemn yourself to nothing.But after all, LIMBO is a puzzle platformer and the instinct to move forward is natural. The puzzles are elegantly designed and make the most of your limited capability for interaction: running, jumping, and moving objects. Everything feels right and the game plays as a good platformer should.LIMBO is not content to only be another decent indie platformer, though, as the puzzles very quickly become trials of dread and fear. Death has always been part of platformers, but LIMBO is almost eager to remind you of the pain. In your desire to move forward, you only introduce to your character more ways to die. If you miss that jump, you will fall down a pit and be impaled on the spikes below. You will have your body torn to pieces by the crushing force of a giant bear trap. You will fall into a ragdoll's seizure as electricity fries you. Even the more quiet deaths feel horrible; drowning in water is a whole process of struggling and sinking before becoming still. The screen will linger and you will sit with it until you are ready to press a button to respawn. Do you want to try again?The hazards of LIMBO seem too much to all be manmade, but they all seem purposeful. It is hard to ignore the sense of malice that pervades this world. The colorless settings and the silhouetted character designs do some amount in making the deaths less gruesome, but only so much. You might find yourself standing still when you get that second chance. To stand still is to do nothing, but to move forward is to create your own hell.But maybe you do keep pushing forward and maybe you do succeed more often than you fail. The purpose of this boy's search for his sister is unclear: it could be a journey of redemption, or love, or curiosity. Either way, that there is even a chance at success and a chance at relief at the other end of each dangerous trial is, in a way, a promise of heaven. There will be hard times ahead, but the pain is not infinite. To be given the chance to find an answer and reach an end is a small but merciful thing. But before that, the hard times will only get harder.There will always be ideas about what lies between heaven and hell, life and death. LIMBO has earned its spot among the best artistic representations of such a place – not only through its undeniable dark beauty, but also the fear that a similar world might await us.			"

												A brilliant, intriguing and yet so ever minimalistic. This has to be one of the best titles I have ever played on steam to date. This 2D puzzle based platform combined with a chilling black and white aesthetic invites players to navigate their way through a mysterious world where many dangers await. With no narration nor instructions this game made me question my very instict and reasoning and arouse such questions such as ""Why do we automatically assume to travel to the right hand side? or even why do we continue to progress through the world if we have been given no such instruction to do so""I would seriously reccomend this game to anyone with an exploriative or questionative personality, or even if you just enjoy a good minimalistic platform based game; A great game for the record books.

												This is what I'd call an atmospheric trial and error simulator.The strong point is the atmosphere: the lighting, the ambient sound and the minimalist contextual storytelling which slowly, horror by horror, unveils one of the grimmest video game worlds the medium has ever seen. Bravo on that point.Then we have the mechanics, inevitably the core of any game. The verb set is fairly rudimentary; you can run, jump, climb, push and pull things, and that about summarises it. The mileage you can get out of these basic actions, coupled with some rudimentary physics, is fairly limiting. But from what I saw of Limbo, the designers compensated somewhat for the repetitive nature of the puzzles by dressing them up in some inventive and creepy set pieces, each one revealing more about the world you find yourself in. So I was ok with the mechanics, at first.Where the game fell apart for me is the checkpoint trial and error nature of the gameplay. The world of Limbo is so perilous that you're only ever a few footsteps away from the next new death animation, and the problem is that for the most part these are not telegraphed to the player. By telegraphed I mean to have just a second where the player senses imminent danger and can react accordingly if they are thinking on their feet. There are too many cases where this doesn't happen in Limbo, such is the sudden and unpredictable nature of many of the traps and hazards. The result of this is that the player is soon conditioned to move forward expectant of death. And the designers know this, that's why there is a checkpoint before and after every little puzzle, trap and monster. So the combined effect of both expecting death and knowing that it's of no consequence results in the player pushing onward carelessly, allowing themselves to be killed and then hoping to learn from their death how to overcome the section on the next attempt. Or the third, fourth or fifth attempt.Unfortunately this no-consequence, checkpoint kind of gameplay adds an extra layer of repetition onto mechanics already inherently repetitive (as mentioned). But worse, much worse, is that it saps any kind of fear or tension from this wonderfully atmospheric world that has been crafted. With no reason to worry about death, no reason to feel triumphant at a near-miss, and no reason for the palms to sweat because of the high stakes and terror, the power of that atmosphere is stripped away. And without that atmosphere what is left behind amounts to an assault course of trial and error physics puzzles that you will attempt dispassionately, again and again, until eventually they just come to bore and irritate you.

												I got this game when steam had the big giveaway a few months back.Short and sweet, this game just isn't my cup of tea. I can appreciate aesthetics that some people might like, but it goes against most of what I look for in a video game. To be specific, everything is black, white, and gray. There is no narration whatsoever. The character you play as is a boy that can do 3 things: run, jump, and activate stuff (either push/pull an object or press a button generally). You face mostly automated obstacles, with a handful of biological and plenty of static obstacles as well as you try to puzzle platform your way through a 2D world. It's a pretty dystopian world, where the people, giant spiders, and Plankton from spongebob are all out to get you.If you like those kinds of things, go for it. It's a 2-3 hour adventure, and the puzzles are pretty good honestly, but the entire aesthetic isn't for me.			"

												Very artistic and stylized, but not very cohesive. The ""challenge,"" of this game comes from it's trial and error attitude. Why does the game feel the need to punish me by showing three seconds of my character's brutal death after ""failing?"" It's not a challenge if I didn't see it coming. Trial and error gameplay works with games like ""I Wanna be the Guy,"" or ""Super Meat Boy,"" where respawn time is instant... but for a puzzle game that requires you to wait and be patient? It just seems like poor game design. I found myself getting annoyed more than getting immersed, and that's never good.Pick it up during a sale.

												Honestly, I think this game gets more hype than it deserves. I mostly finished this to prove that I could rather than because I wanted to. The environment is eerie, beautiful, and quite unique as well, certainly offering an enticing atmosphere like the title would suggest. Most notably for me was the soundtrack. Though consisting of only a few pieces, the music is haunting and enjoyable to listen to, helping to build onto the world. I only wish it was more present in the game since my main dose of it came from listening to the soundtrack that I acquired with my bundle purchase. The controls are also simple, intuitive, and tight so most things are down to player timing and ability rather than mushy controls. Other than that... a lot of the puzzles were kind of tedious. Many deaths felt kind of cheap, because so many things just felt unavoidable the first time you're playing through something, so multiple attempts at puzzles were a must. Additionally, while I did mention this as a plus, the controls make it so your timing needs to be SPOT ON. A fraction of a second could mean yet another infuriating death. While a lot of people praise the story in this game, I felt like it wasn't there at all. It's so open ended that it doesn't even feel like a plot exists. You're dropped into gameplay and after a few hours it ends. Nothing explaining who you are, why you're there, or what your goal is aside from not dying a ridiculous number of times. So overall, I don't think I'd really recommend this game unless all you're looking for is a puzzle/platformer and you don't mind the lack of a story.			"

												BEYOND FRUSTRATING & BORINGYou can't employ any kind of strategy in this game when there's hidden traps there to kill you constantly. Then you get to e-do the section over and over until you memorize where every trap is. I was forcing myself to play this game but I just couldn't anymore. I wish I never bought it			"

												A cute puzzle game, but the description on the store page is more story than the entire game will give you. Some of the puzzles make very clever use of character momentum, but I just didn't feel like I was having much fun solving the puzzles and I kept thinking things like, ""Why are we in a factory now?""  and things like that. There's some undertones that the forest is causing all sorts of hallucinations and that most of this is just in the kid's head, but as I mentioned before, the game never decides to give you a single line of text as an explanation. The game might be worth it if it's on a big sale, but I beat the thing in three hours and it really doesn't have any replay value.			"

												For what it is, I can't find a true fault with LIMBO. The game doesn't claim to be anything it isn't, it's a simple puzzle/sidescrolling game that will at times leave you frustrated and put out, only to experience that giddiness of figuring it out shortly thereafter. It never traipses about claiming to be anything more than it is. For lack of the ingenuity to phrase it better, they whole♥♥♥♥♥♥♥what they envisioned, and left the rest by the wayside.The plot is vague, so secondary it might as well not exist... and I'm quite alright with that in this case. You are tossed into a bleak, unforgiving, and cruelly beautiful world to... move to the right (and die quite a few times on your way). Might not seem like much, but it's stunning and worth every minute.Obligatory mention that Martin Stig Andersen's work on this only reinforces my mild to manic obsession with well done soundtracks. Phenomenally moody, reminiscent of quite a bit of John Luther Adams' work. I can't imagine anything more fitting.A small part that I particularly enjoyed are that the achievements... are actually achievements. It doesn't throw you one every time you remember to blink or jump for the first time.Wonderful game.			"

												beat it in/wasted my 2-3 hours. I'm completely lost at how it was any bit entertaining and got a 90 metacritic.Traps usually require you to get killed to see how they work, puzzle design is completely inflexible and doesn't allow for any creative thinking and the story is ambiguous to the extent that they clearly didn't bother writing one in the first place. Trials and Error is frustrating as ♥♥♥♥, no hints, just step a wrong foot and you have to restart, then you have to watch that slow♥♥♥♥♥kid slowly walk and jump somewhere.Meh art (black & white, so?), shoddy game design, zero replay value, and zero interest in anything else the developer makes.

												When all's said and done, it's the art style and atmosphere that made this game a success. The puzzles are generally above average for games of this type, although they mostly use rather vanilla mechanics that have been seen before in countless other games (push blocks around, swing on ropes, pull levers to change states of machinery etc. etc.) It's an amazing game at first: artistic, eerie atmosphere; an intriguing story; and a variety of clever mini-puzzles.  Sadly, at about the halfway point it stops being about puzzles and starts being about running as fast as you can and perfect-timing every jump. The puzzle design becomes far too reliant on precision timing, and frustration tends to dominate. What I found was that you fairly quickly work out *what* you are supposed to do, but the act of *actually* executing the sequence is bogged down with endless trial-and-error as you have to constantly micro-adjust the positions of things, and re-adjust your timing until you hit that split-second and pixel-perfect ""sweet spot"" that allows progression to actually occur. When it takes 30secs to figure out the solution, but 10 minutes of repeating the same sequence over and over until you hit that jump just right (for example), then there is something obviously wrong with the design. Best way of summing it up - it's a bit like how Braid would have played if you were allowed to rewind time. Ouch.Just as it was introducing some interesting mechanics, the game ended. Add to that the ending is a huge disappointment story wise (no real spoilers, but suffice to say: it ends like an Arthouse movie, not at all like a fantastic mystery). Thoroughly disappointing beyond the first half.			"

												Play this game only if you hate fun.This game has a handful of mechanics that really detract from the fun. First, your character dies when he touches water. What is this, 1998? This would not be so annoying, except for the fact that it piggy-backs off of another problem with this game: not solving puzzles correctly results in you dying, and therefore reloading a checkpoint. Tons of these puzzles involve water or some stupid insta-kill mechanic. However, neither of these two mechanics would annoy me nearly as much if it weren't for a third mechanic: it is almost impossible to solve a puzzle without failing it first. So, there are annoying insta-kill mechanics to puzzles that you are set up to fail. This makes the game artificially hard. None of the puzzles are difficult, except for the fact that you get stuck dying at one part over and over just to realize to had to backtrack (yes, another annoying mechanic) a few screens and pick up some object you thought was part of the background to solve a puzzle.What this game does have going for it are a unique art style and mood. However, after a few minutes of the ""soundtrack"" (read: ambient synthesizer nonsense), you feel like you OD'd on benzo's and are unsure if the blurriness of the game is the art style or your brain dissolving in your skull. This game is apparently a great example of minimalist narrative, but I can't get past the gimmicks and archaic game mechanics to care.			"

												Ok, it was nice to play, I can't say it wasn't. Maybe it's just I heard to many good opinions about this game. I probably expected too much, therefore I've been disappointed...The puzzles are clever and not so easy, the ambience is interesting, but... Ok, it's not that I don't like to move a character from left to right but... at least, give me a small reason to do so ? A story for example ? Anything ? And that end, I'm sorry but this is not an open ending like I've heard sometimes. To make an open ending, you need to have a story in the first place. This, was, eventually, the begining of a story. Which happens after 4 hours of ""wtf am I doing here ?"".(SPOILER) When I saw the first human in the game, a kid who was activating a trap in order to kill me, I thought ""oh, nice ! it finally begins, so mysterious !"" And no, nothing, no explanation, just all the living things you meet are trying to kill you. Like in any poor game with a poor storyline. Sigh...So, no, I don't understand why this game has so many good comments. It was ""ok"", but not that good... And it had a very good potential. Frustrating.			"

												I haven't finished the game yet, but so far it's pretty good. I got it when it was free for a couple days and I'm glad I did. But it's definetely worth $10 if you're looking for a good puzzle/platformer game.The story so far has got me interested. I plan on updating this review once I reach the end so I can share my thoughts, but so far it's great. As far as I know it's about a boy who enters Limbo after his sister goes missing, as the description states, and that's all I know.The art stlyle is amazing too. Even though it's mostly black and grey, it still looks pretty somehow.Get this game, even if you can't get it for free anymore, it's still worth the money.UPDATE:I've finished the game now, and I have to say that I loved it. It leaves you without any explanation and a lot to think about. It only took me around 3 and a half hours to beat this game, but it was one of the best 3.4 hours I've ever had playing a video game.I highly recommend this game. The puzzles are good but not too hard, the art style is great, and the story kept me interested all the way until it's end. I plan on playing it again and finding all the secrets very soon.10/10			"

												Ultimately, not what I expected. I normally hate 2D platformers/sidescrollers because of the oversaturated market, but this was actually a good game despite its flaws (which was the inherited overhype). I think what made me respect this game was the excuse for having such a simple artstyle. That gets so abused today, but I liked this. Maybe the simplicity is what makes it what it is? At least the story anyway. The dystopian world could do with more details, but you don't always need details to send a message. Many take a really obvious explanation to the ending, but I like thinking of it much more philosophically; something everyone can relate to sometime in their life. This makes the game so much more powerful, and particularly interesting, and I believe it to be the very best way to enjoy it. Play it by yourself on a lonely evening and ponder about life as a whole. ""I swear, when did I experience something like this?"" was the thought I got after every chapter. Truly wonderful.The game as a whole I don't think is commendable other than that. The format is classic, which doesn't make it worse, but I don't understand the sacredness of it. This is just how a game should be felt like playing I think, a real game for once!			"

												Wonderful presentation - lackluster game design.That's how I would sum up Limbo in one sentence, and it is a shame. I love difficult games and I have a high tolerance for frustration, but this is the wrong kind of 'difficult'. Solving puzzles feels brainless and uninspiring in this title, especially towards the end. My main complatint is that you cannot use logic to do so, but rather have to apply trial and error in pretty much every situation. Usually, you will have a general idea of how to approach a puzzle, but in order to execute it correctly you have to repeat the same sequence over and over with just tiny variations.. In my opinion, a good puzzle game should give the player different elements to play around with and find out how they interact. Unfortunately, this is not Limbo's focus, as most puzzles feel very one-dimensional. Just compare that to Portal: In Portal, there is a general sense of achievement after solving a puzzle, even though the game is by no means hard. That's because the solutions are not apparent right away, and you have to mentally rearange the elements, thus making the player actively involved. In Limbo, on the other hand, you can see right away that you have to stop a cogwheel at the right moment in order to advance, but figuring out the right timing may take you about 20 attempts. What you feel after finally succeeding is not wonder at the imaginativeness of the devs, but disbelieve that you had to repeat the same boring task 20 times.On the positive side of things, the atmosphere in this game is deep and brooding. If for nothing else, it might be worth checking it out just for the experience of the early game stages. If you enjoy it enough and do not mind the highly repetetive game play, this might just be the right title for you. Unfortunately, I just can't give it a thumbs up, as I felt more annoyed at the lacking puzzle design than enchanted by the artistic quality. This is one of those games that might really appeal to some people but not to others, so best try it out for yourself. The majority of folks here on Steam appear to have a different opinion from mine, which I am perfectly fine with. I am glad that others got more enjoyment out of this game than myself.(BTW, the amount of hours played in my profile is misleading, as I played most of this game off-line)			"

												Played this game years back when it was launched on windows., so glad to see it on Mac finally. This game is absolute brilliance. No game has quite given me the thrill and experience and calm and heart-attacks all at same time, this game is so peaceful yet so horrific, so calm yet so bone-chilling...i can go on and on. If you havent played it yet you are missing a gaming experience like no other. Must-play Must-have experience.			"

												A wonderful puzzle adventure that lacks a proper story to back it up. The grainy, monochromatic video presents an eerie ambience in that quiet, but deadly place they call Limbo--somewhere between life and the afterlife. The puzzles are well thought out and not overly difficult, but the price of failure is death and that price will be paid often. Short and sweet, Limbo is certainly worth a look.			"

												Limbo was gorgeous. I loved the environments. The whole game was creepy in a beautiful way. Gameplay was very simple. You can only move, jump, and grab. Most of the puzzles were fair and not too easy. A few did trip me up. Get prepared to die gruesomely. During several parts you only learn what you have to do after dying the first time. There are no words spoken, and not much a storyline other than there is a girl you are trying to get to. I guess this is a negative, but really a game like this doesn't need dialogue or a storyline.I wish the game were longer, but 3 hours isn't bad considering other similar games.I never like big spiders in games, but there are no jump scares in this game.

But it's fun to try. It's such great game. Esp if it's the first time your playing it and don't know what to expect as you progress in the game.

												Sort of like if Mario had a really bad trip. In terms of it's basic mechanics, LIMBO's basic premise is that the protagonist (who seems to be a young boy) wakes up in a forest, and it's your job to guide him through the many dangerous in this terrifying world. The game pairs traditional platforming with light puzzle-solving elements through a fairly linear exploration/progression; basically, keep going right, and solve the puzzles so you can keep going in that direction. Though this a short game, in the process of completing it you'll pass through forests, caverns, sewers, and derelict factories and cities.The atmosphere is utterly enthralling; the entire game is in grainy black-and-white; there is almost no soundtrack, only very dark and minimalistic ambient effects; there is no dialogue at any point in this game, and the only other NPCs you meet all try to kill you in a variety of ways. And this game really is dark; giant spiders impale you on their legs, boulders crush you, worms take control of you and often force you to run off cliffs, and bear-traps crush you in their vice-like grip.  his is an utterly hostile and terrifying world. One section has the player cross a lake by jumping across the floating corpses of people forced to wade into the lakes to their deaths by mind-altering worms. Having crossed the lake, the solution to the next puzzle is to then drag one of the bodies out and to push it over a ledge onto a button, which causes a huge block to fall crushing the body, which would have been you had you activated the button yourself. This is a very, very dark game.And the puzzle-solving elements do become quite challenging as the game goes on, through it never reaches the difficulty of games such as Braid. The game steadily introduces new mechanics to keep things fresh, with switches that can reverse gravity or active giant magnets, while the feedback for failure is always immediate and brutal. Thankfully the game has no loading screens even upon death so you can be back to have another go in a matter of seconds.The plot itself is thread-bare. There is no dialogue and no non-hostile characters besides one recurring one, whose finding seems to be the only real objective in this game. That does not mean the plot is not there though, and to me it seems like the team behind this deliberately left the game open to interpretation; the game is called LIMBO, how does that relate to the environments you find yourself in and the things that happen to you on your journey? Who are these other people you encounter from time to time? What happened to these factories and sewers and cities? These questions are never answered straight-forwardly, but it's for you to decide for yourself what this game is about and to me that makes it more powerful.			"

Anyone, who doesn't mind, seeing their animated character, die horrifying and unnatural deaths, should give this game a whirl.  Is quite the little entropic puzzler.  If you enjoyed the Saw movies, you'd probably enjoy this game, it centers around trap device deaths! 4/5 Stars			"

												While it only took me 3.4 hours to beat, those 3.4 hours were some of the best I have had in my gaming history. Lately, indie titles like Braid, Trine, Limbo and others have been some of my favorite games overall. Not only does Limbo have amazing puzzle solving gameplay but it also has a... I feel weird saying this... a very touching storyline. Also, for a game with no writen or spoken words, Limbo has possibly the greatest atmosphere of any game (only competition would be S.T.A.L.K.E.R.) and it never gets old. I hope to God there is a sequel to this game, either way, I cannot wait to play the next game from developer Playdead, and please do yourself a favor and experience this game.5/5			"

												I Really love this game. It's dark, twisted, artistic and it really tickled my sadistic nature when it came to dying in the game.Pro's:> The artistic design is well put together for a black n white scheme.> Inventive puzzles that are eager to entertain.> Death does not throw you completely backwards in the game.> Simple controls.> Death scenario's that can entertain even the mildest sadist.Con's:>The game is quite short ( took me 2 hours to complete ). Thats a big one for me.> The game really lacks a storyline. A Player really should be able to start a game, and have a basic understanding. The gist of the storyline is only really obtained out of game.> Doesnt offer much to encourage player to replay the game.Overall, the game may have been rather short which dissapointed me in the end. But i do not regret purchasing it as it did provide me with a pleasant experiance.I Do hope to see a second installment one day, but hopefully they expand on the idea and provide an even better play experiance.

												Wonderful, moody game. It's so good I want to make love with it. Love the silhouette graphics, the atmosphere, the controls, it's all very polished. A lot of developers should take note. This game kept me interested the whole time, there was not one single dull moment. Yes, it's 3,5 hours long. Or short, it depends on the way you look at it of course. Games don't have to be necessarily long to be good and this is one of the best examples. A must own and a must play. You owe it to yourself as a gamer.[Rating: 90/100]			"

They very few humans encountered with try their hardest to kill you, but you're just a little too badass for 'em.

												LIMBO is an atmospheric masterpiece. Disturbing, terrifying and exciting. This game really cuts deep if you delve into it. I recommend playing in a dark room, lights out, headphones out (and possibly being stoned, the magnified senses help!). I do have a few gripes with some of the cheap/annoying platformer segments. Most puzzles are easy, but sometimes too annoying/bothersome (as mentioned already) to pull off, but that is negligible. The thing you play this game for isn't the platformer action, it's the thrills from the atmosphere.I also got the game for free, which was neat.Overall - Wonderful experience 9/10			"

												I Really love this game. It's dark, twisted, artistic and it really tickled my sadistic nature when it came to dying in the game.Pro's:> The artistic design is well put together for a black n white scheme.> Inventive puzzles that are eager to entertain.> Death does not throw you completely backwards in the game.> Simple controls.> Death scenario's that can entertain even the mildest sadist.Con's:>The game is quite short ( took me 2 hours to complete ). Thats a big one for me.> The game really lacks a storyline. A Player really should be able to start a game, and have a basic understanding. The gist of the storyline is only really obtained out of game.> Doesnt offer much to encourage player to replay the game.Overall, the game may have been rather short which dissapointed me in the end. But i do not regret purchasing it as it did provide me with a pleasant experiance.I Do hope to see a second installment one day, but hopefully they expand on the idea and provide an even better play experiance.

												Limbo was gorgeous. I loved the environments. The whole game was creepy in a beautiful way. Gameplay was very simple. You can only move, jump, and grab. Most of the puzzles were fair and not too easy. A few did trip me up. Get prepared to die gruesomely. During several parts you only learn what you have to do after dying the first time. There are no words spoken, and not much a storyline other than there is a girl you are trying to get to. I guess this is a negative, but really a game like this doesn't need dialogue or a storyline.I wish the game were longer, but 3 hours isn't bad considering other similar games.I never like big spiders in games, but there are no jump scares in this game.

												The hype around this game, while having finally died down, was entirely undeserved. The script for this game seems to have been taken straight from the ""I'm so deep"" musings of your average high school teen, with an ending that is as groan-inducing as it is anticlimactic. While the game features a few neat gimmicks here and there, the inconsistent design and half-baked controls ensure an experience that fails to overcome its nuisances. This would perhaps capture the heart of young teens who just finished reading (the sparknotes for) 1984, but otherwise Limbo absolutely fails to live up to the love it has been given.			"

												I am a ferret wearing a bowtie.My eyes work best at night. This is probably why i like Limbo. It takes place at night. If not night then maybe in purgatory. I've always imagined walking form left to right in purgatory to be very much like walking left to right in Limbo. Did you know that some people claim ferrets have very poor depth perception? Some even say they have none at all! maybe that is why i walk off the tables edge all the time. Maybe this is why i love Limbo so much. You know being a ferret and how we play video games on a 2D screen. I am certainly NOT looking forward to this virtual reality nonsense. And what the hell was up with 3D TV? They'll never capture the ferret market with silly extra dimensional crap like that.			"

Around the second half of the game, however, the game shifts into a somewhat generic platform puzzle, but don't let that stop you from playing this. It will take you between 2 and 4 hours to complete it, depending on how well you handle some of the more difficult puzzles. Definitely pick this up if you can get it for $5 or less.			"

												Limbo is an extremely dark puzzle-adventure game. The game is hilariously sick, creating an atmosphere easily meant for older crowds, despite the childish appearance of the game. The graphics and rendering are amazing and beautifully crafted. The puzzles start easy and increase in difficulty at an even pace, building up in darkness as well as becoming more challenging. The game forces the player to pay close attention and really think of what they have to do. The only downside to the game is how relatively short the gameplay is. After only a few extremely short hours, one reaches the end of the game. While the game itself is interesting and fun, the shortness creates an overall sense of one being unfufilled. Unless, the player is someone who enjoys a quick and challenging game. Any sequals or exstensions for the game would be greatly anticipated.Fun 4/5, Originality 4/5, Mature 4/5, Graphics 5/5, Addictive 2/5, Repetative 2/5, Worth the Price 3/5			"

												Probably one of the better supporting arguments in the ""video games as art"" debate. This atmospheric platformer must be experienced. At 3-4 hours, it's very short. But, if it were longer, you might go crazy, so that's probably okay.			"

												Mixed feelings, and not in a good way...Yes, this game is beautiful in terms of art. At first, it really sets this gloomy mood that I enjoy.The first few levels are finely balanced, just tricky enough to be challenging, but still easy enough to pass if you try.But somewhere along the way, the atmosphere fades and all that's left is frustration. The majority of puzzles require precise timing and trial and error, with some fake difficulty thrown in for good measures. Even the slightest mistake means death, and while the checkpoints were (luckily) generous, you were still forced to repeat some very annoying sections. In short, I would say the utterly disappointing ending just wasn't worth the hassle.And then came the terrible hunt for the DING! achievement.While completely optional, this part was just one huge step in the wrong direction. Walking in pitch-black darkness for long minutes only to be killed by a randomly positioned sawblade that you cannot see really isn't my idea of fun...			"

But it's fun to try. It's such great game. Esp if it's the first time your playing it and don't know what to expect as you progress in the game. It's great to watch others play if it's there first time playing as well. Must buy. :]			"

												Sort of like if Mario had a really bad trip. In terms of it's basic mechanics, LIMBO's basic premise is that the protagonist (who seems to be a young boy) wakes up in a forest, and it's your job to guide him through the many dangerous in this terrifying world. The game pairs traditional platforming with light puzzle-solving elements through a fairly linear exploration/progression; basically, keep going right, and solve the puzzles so you can keep going in that direction. Though this a short game, in the process of completing it you'll pass through forests, caverns, sewers, and derelict factories and cities.The atmosphere is utterly enthralling; the entire game is in grainy black-and-white; there is almost no soundtrack, only very dark and minimalistic ambient effects; there is no dialogue at any point in this game, and the only other NPCs you meet all try to kill you in a variety of ways. And this game really is dark; giant spiders impale you on their legs, boulders crush you, worms take control of you and often force you to run off cliffs, and bear-traps crush you in their vice-like grip.  his is an utterly hostile and terrifying world. One section has the player cross a lake by jumping across the floating corpses of people forced to wade into the lakes to their deaths by mind-altering worms. Having crossed the lake, the solution to the next puzzle is to then drag one of the bodies out and to push it over a ledge onto a button, which causes a huge block to fall crushing the body, which would have been you had you activated the button yourself. This is a very, very dark game.And the puzzle-solving elements do become quite challenging as the game goes on, through it never reaches the difficulty of games such as Braid. The game steadily introduces new mechanics to keep things fresh, with switches that can reverse gravity or active giant magnets, while the feedback for failure is always immediate and brutal. Thankfully the game has no loading screens even upon death so you can be back to have another go in a matter of seconds.The plot itself is thread-bare. There is no dialogue and no non-hostile characters besides one recurring one, whose finding seems to be the only real objective in this game. That does not mean the plot is not there though, and to me it seems like the team behind this deliberately left the game open to interpretation; the game is called LIMBO, how does that relate to the environments you find yourself in and the things that happen to you on your journey? Who are these other people you encounter from time to time? What happened to these factories and sewers and cities? These questions are never answered straight-forwardly, but it's for you to decide for yourself what this game is about and to me that makes it more powerful.			"

												Wow. I first came across this game when Yahtzee did a ZP on the original XBox Live Arcade release, and eagerly awaited the release of a PC version. Thankfully we didn't have to wait too long, and it was well worth it.This game is *bleak*. You are insignificant, you will die a lot, and nothing and nobody cares about you. The atmosphere is wonderfully downbeat, especially when you think things can't get any worse and then the rain starts coming down...The less said about the plot the better. Not so much because I don't want to spoil things, but because it doesn't really have one, besides ""You're looking for your sister"". But that's not the point. Just walk right, get killed, try again. Walk right, die, try again.It won't take more than a couple of hours to finish this game, but it's very pretty and enjoyable to play. Plus the red/blue 3D mode is kind of interesting if you have a pair of glasses lying around.			"

												One of the classic indie games, Limbo is a puzzle(ish) platformer that absolutely nailed aesthetic and inspired imitators for years to come. Sometimes the controls don't feel precise and the deaths feel contrived due to lack of prior knowledge of the traps, but that's well mitigated by a competent checkpointing system that helps relieve any potential frustration. It's the kind of game where you can give it an initial run just to enjoy the experience (and get to see all the horrific death animations), then replay it and challenge yourself to do better, even avoid dying altogether. Not a perfect game, but still a great one. It's pretty easy to find cheap and worth picking up.			"

												I decided to play this after having heard so many great things about this game. Other games that I have enjoyed are sometimes compared to this game. Conclusion: this game is massively overrated.Yes, the game is atmospheric (although there is pretty much only one uniform atmosphere). The greyscale is good and the sound effects are a nice touch in some spots. Use of lighting (or lack thereof) is interesting in some areas. It's a straight up puzzle platformer though. It's mysterious, but not particularly ""dark"". Story and soundtrack are non-existent. There is a lot of trial and error where the way to pass a puzzle is to get killed through no fault of your own, and then figure out how to avoid the death, which makes it feel like the game is playing against you, not with you. The character you play is not particularly agile and doesn't always feel responsive to the controls. The game was short, but that's probably a good thing.			"

Anyone, who doesn't mind, seeing their animated character, die horrifying and unnatural deaths, should give this game a whirl.  Is quite the little entropic puzzler.  If you enjoyed the Saw movies, you'd probably enjoy this game, it centers around trap device deaths! 4/5 Stars			"

												Limbo is a some sort of trial-and-error game where you will often, in first attempts, fail and die.  Once you see what happened and why,  there is not much left to figure out the how part.   If you know everything in the game, it will take about 60 minutes to complete.   Without the knowledge on how to bypass all the obstacles,  it can take up to 3 or 4 hours to complete a playthrough.   If you enjoy a trial-and-error game like Limbo and Super Meat Boy, you should like this one.   I recommend this game in that sense.   The only bad thing I find about this game is that there is no replayability at all once you figured out everything about this game. (Same case for all trial-and-error games out there)My personal rating of this game is 6.5/10.			"

												LIMBO is not a good game. It is not a great game. It's an alright game that molds quickly when left out too long.The graphics are pretty interesting, and are the game's main gimmick in terms of bringing new ideas to the world of Platformers.The setting starts out beautifully, the dark and morbid forest full of disturbing atmosphere straight out of Dark Souls, but then quickly falls apart about halfway through. Once you leave the forest, the entirety of the rest of the game is in a disgustingly boring industrial factory-esque area that leaves pretty much anything the game had going for it behind in the dust, changing the mood of the game pretty dramatically in a way that I can't say I enjoyed whatsoever. It's pretty much just straight puzzles, a box-moving gravity-flipping gauntlet of nonstop boring puzzles, without any of the flavor the early levels had.There is no story. Any. At all. If you expect anything more than ""go to the right"" you'll be disappointed. This is a great game for illiterate gamers, since there is no reading proficiency needed to enjoy the non-existant plot.                The puzzles are usually pretty simple, but I'll admit got me stumped once or twice, so there's still some challenge in it. My major complaint about the level design is that the primary source of difficulty comes from the slow and clunky movement of the child, given there are many many challenges that revolve around you moving very quickly and even at your fastest may only make it by a thin margin.All in all, If this game's second half hadn't been such a terrible turn of scenery, atmosphere, and gameplay, this game could have gotten a reccomendation from me. The opening sections were so much fun. But seriously though everything past the forest is just hot garbage, and I don't want anyone to have to play through that again unless they're stuck in a twelve hour flight layover and forgot any other source of entertainment to bring with them besides a laptop and this game on it. It's that bad.			"

												Cuando te encontras con un juego como Limbo te das cuenta que ya no es solo que los videojuegos forman parte del Arte, sino que estos pueden formar parte de esas obras únicas, a las que llamamos, obra maestra. Sí, Limbo es una obra maestra, un juego de puzzles en plataformas, con una estética y apartado gráfico únicos, el juego pone a prueba tu habilidad y a la vez te regala un paseo visual digno de un cuadro de exposición de alto coste.Una obra de arte maestra suele pagarse millones, pero es que hasta los devs pusieron este grandioso juego de forma gratuita para añadirlo a nuestra biblioteca, de forma abierta y desinteresada, para que más gente lo pueda jugar.El sonido esta muy bien logrado, los efectos en pantalla, particulas, desenfoques, animaciones en general, todo esta perfectamente cuidado a lujo de detalle.Sí, te lo recomiendo, si no lo conseguiste gratis, pagalo... pensa que hay gente que pagó por el overwatch 60 euros, porque no gastar un poquito, en algo tan grande como este juego?Si tengo que poner un puntaje, le doy un 10.

												If you like little to no story with lots of frustrating and unforgiving puzzles, this game is for you. LIMBO has a cool ambiance and art style... that's about it. There's no naration, the character doesn't speak at all, you traverse random landscape after random landscape of some dystopian black and white h*ll hole with no explanation as to what's happening or why you're here. And also, screw whoever thought brain burrowing parasites was a cool idea. There's no way to avoid them, they're annoying as f**k, and they're disgusting. You get some white p.o.s. that lands on your head and burrows into it; which makes you go whichever direction it pleases until you find some sort of light sorce to burn it to make you turn around. THEN you have to find another nasty insect thing to rip it out of your head and eat it... as if it wasn't hard enough to figure out what the h*ll was going on or what you're suppose to be doing. I'm glad I got this game for free from some one day random Steam deal cause if I spent money on it, I'd be asking for a refund. The ending was also the epitome of the term anti-climactic that made the reason for you being there more or less confusing depending on how you interpret it as well as the whole game.			"

												Honestly, looking at the other reviews I wonder if people were playing the same game I did. Maybe this style of game is not for me, but I could not stand this game for these reasons:- Extremely simple puzzles. Most can be solved by accident without any thought at all.- Frustrating ""do it again, stupid"" method of introducing threats. What do I mean by this? I mean that most of your deaths are going to be because the game fails to introduce threats. So most solutions around death areas are simply trial and error. - Super boring. Aside from a few well done segments, you just hold right. I made it most of the way through the game, but simply couldn't finish because the game had long since lost my interest. Honestly, if you haven't gotten this game yet, save your money and watch a Let's Play on YouTube, it's the same experience for free.			"

												I had this game on my wishlist for awhile as it seemed to have been unanimously praised. When it was offered for free on Steam 6/21 and 6/22, I was eager to try it out. I was ultimately very disappointed with the game. Several times during my playthrough, I commented to friends that had I purchased Limbo, I likely would have refunded the game without hesitation.Positives: + The graphic style is unique and the developers succeeded in creating an atmosphere that makes the player feel isolated and uncertain. It reminded me a bit of how Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions used the noir graphics. From an aesthetic standpoint, Limbo is a treat. The game runs at a constant 60FPS (locked) at 1080p.+ The game length (about 3-4 hours on a first playthrough) is just about right. I didn't really want to play it any more than this (more on this below).+ The checkpoint system is generous. Given the instant-death, trial-and-error nature of the puzzles, it is necessary.Negatives: - The trial-and-error nature of the puzzles is more frustrating than it is motivating. Successfully overcoming the objectives doesn't feel rewarding and oftentimes the solutions can only be discovered by dying repeatedly. Cheap deaths occur regularly, often from unavoidable hazards intentionally obscured by the shadows. Limbo seems to go for the ""gotcha"" and it ranges from irritating to frustrating. There is one particular puzzle (about 2/3rds through) where the game provides a paradigm to follow and then a second later rips the carpet out from under the player by shifting it so that the same action results in instant death. It isn't clever. I enjoy games that challenge me to think, and failing in games like Portal or The Talos Principle felt fair and motivated me to try again. Limbo left me wanting to press on simply so I could get through the game. After 3-4 hours, I had enough.- Movement feels floaty. The best comparison I could make would be Little Big Planet as that also features wonky platorming, but Limbo is worse. For a game that oftentimes requires precise timing/jumping, character movement is oftentimes sluggish.- The game lacks any graphics options and in general the settings are extremely bare-bones. Before playing through Limbo I thought this was at worst an oversight, at best an attempt by the developer to emphasize the experience rather than having the user worry about tweaking framerates and texture levels. After playing, I am inclined to think this was a conscious decision done not in the spirit of emphasizing a certain aesthetic but rather to scold the player for daring to want to adjust or customize the experience to their liking. Maybe that's unfair, but given the ""gotcha"" moments experienced in the puzzles, it combined with the lack of options to give me that sort of feeling.Conclusion:Had I paid for this game, I would have refunded it. Given that it was offered free for a limited time, all I lost was my time. Limbo is a game that has a unique aesthetic that is tarnished by the worst sort of trial-and-error puzzles, I would not recommend this game.			"

												Limbo is one of the bigger disappointment I've encountered in my roughy two decades as a video game connoisseur, which is mostly due to realizing that this game could have been so much better. Don't get me wrong, though. There is a lot to like here: the art style is great, the animations are very good, the ambient music is well-done. However, the main gameplay loop is unsatisfying. The problem is that, juding from what I have seen of the game (a little over half, just based on the amount of chapters), the puzzles all have only one solution, which is not something I appreciate in a puzzle game. A much bigger problem, though, is that the pace of the game is so incredibly slugglish. Your avatar walks as if he is geriatric. To add insult to injury, some sections do demand a bit of dexterity, leaving not much room for error. If the controls were tight and responsibe, the occasional trial and error gameplay wouldn't be so bad.The game being as it is, though, there is plenty of frustration to be had. Due to shortcomings with regards to the controls as well as the design (some puzzles are too much based on trial and error; most gameplay mechanics are introducted in a situation that quickly kills you instead of giving you some room to experiment without any danger), you easily end up dying. For instance, you figure out the solution to a puzzle but misjudge a jump. Thus, you slowly fall to your death. So, you watch the character move in slow-mo, he dies, the game draws out this moment much too long. A cinematic (?) pause has to pass afterwards before you can try again. Just to avoid any misunderstanding: it is not the case that I had been fumbling through half the game and then quit. No, instead I realized that this game is artificially drawn out due to questionable design decisions. With better controls and a faster feedback loop this game would take only about half as long. I couldn't see myself suffering through the rest of the game, so I quit.(I got Limbo for free during a special promotion on Steam.)			"

												I guess I'm in the minority.I can't say I enjoyed this game. It's hard to write that. The game is clearly special, from a sound design and visual esthetic perspective. However, from a gameplay perspective, it's terrible. And I don't say that just because I'm bad at the game - I am. But that's not why I didn't like it. I didn't like it, because so much of the game expects you to play by trial and error. There's visual and sound cues, sure. But that doesn't make it better when you're still trying in vain to figure out what you're doing wrong and you've died 27 times in the same spot. Almost worse is when you know what you are supposed to do, and you still can't quite manage to get that one jump timed correctly. To add to that, there's moments (many of them) where you're not dying (no, really) and you simply have no clue what the game expects of you. Maybe I'm thick-witted and slow-fingered. Maybe I'm just tired after work. Limbo punishes me for everything that I do wrong and some of the things I do right. But that's not why I play games - I play them to have fun. Limbo isn't fun; it's annoying, obtuse, and requires regular backtracking and exploration of areas that you don't even know exist.Visuals: 9/10Sound: 9/10Fun: 3/10 (all the various deaths are entertaining, briefly)Overall: 4.5/10Would not die in Limbo again.I got Limbo for free, and it still cost me too much.

												I got this free for the summer steam sale, but I really have not enjoyed it. I had heard that it was a ""good game"", or was one of those masterpiece indie games that we come across. But after playing for about 2 hours, the effort of playing is not worth it. I genuinely enjoyed parts of this game, the minimal audio, the art, the suspense and atmosphere are all great, but it's not enough to make me finish the game. This game may have a deeper meaning, or have a moral to the story, or could really be a work of art, but the gameplay itself is not fun or enjoyable in any meaningful way. Art can be meaningful, but if it's not at least somewhat pleasant or enjoyable then it's really not worth it in my opinion. My experience with the game has been a grinding of the nerves.			"

												While I did pick this game up for free on the Steam Sale I can say I actually paid for it via Humble Bundle a while back. This is just my summary of what the game's about. You can decide if it's your thing for yourself.-A puzzle platformer that, interestingly, does NOT rely on a single gimmick to sell the game. It's just your character, no special powers, you can run, jump, and push things. The game frequently switches from puzzle to platformer and back and forth, some ""Puzzles"" just being rather difficult platforming challenges and some things that seem like platforming challenges actually being puzzles, or a mix of both.-REQUIRES trial and error to get ahead. There are times where the game will just kill you through no fault of your own. It does often use this to clever effect, but this can feel frustrating and unfair. However as the checkpoints are very lenient I don't mind this much and just see it as a different game design approach. LIMBO treats death not as failure but a learning opportunity, though what you learn is sometimes sadly just ""Don't do that next time"".-First half of the game focuses on atmosphere, second half starts focusing on some significantly harder puzzles. There is a point in the last part of the game where it pretty much just becomes purely puzzles. Thankfully IMO these lategame puzzles are actually pretty good.-Several well-hidden secrets to find that sometimes require you to ""Break"" puzzles outright doing something you might initially think was an exploit. I love it when games make you think you broke them and then reveal they actually planned for you doing that.-Platforming and general character interaction is what I'd define as, interestingly ""Hyperrealistic"". What I mean by that is your character moves and interacts with the environment, dies, and platforms is done in a way that feels realistic to the extreme. For some they won't like this platforming approach, and it also makes the game veeeery child-unfriendly as the kid's deaths are often pretty gruesome. It's not Mortal Kombat where the game takes joy in the fatalities, however, but in fact what happens is pretty much exactly what you would in real life, which only makes it more disturbing. This also makes the controls feel ""Unresponsive"" for some people but if you ask me from actually playing it just means you can't turn your character instantaneously or bunny hop like it's CS:GO.-Very atmospheric art style. This is not a game you want to play if you want to feel bouncy and happy.-Story is at best minimalistic and at worst nonexistent.Overall LIMBO is NOT for everyone. That's gotta be stressed. Even if you like puzzle platformers it's not guarenteed you'll like this. However, if you've got 4 or so hours to kill you can sit down for an atmospheric jaunt that you'll probably enjoy somewhat.

												got it in a bundle...It's an OK puzzle game but definitly not worth the 10 dollars it asks at full price.Most puzzle are trivial, but at least they didn't artificially up the difficulty by being purposely obscure like some other developer.completed in 1 or 2 hour, absolutely no replay value (steam hours didn't record because offline).Story is weird and trying (failing at least for me) to be poetic. made no sense.Still recommend if you can get it cheaper and if you like the esthetic, as I couldn't find anything wrong with it mechanicaly .

												Christians sure put the 'un' in 'fun' - even croaking at a young age won't spare you from infinite damp darkness filled with impalement, mutilation, electrocution, drowning and giant♥♥♥♥♥spiders.It's amazing what can be accomplished atmospherically with 2 colors and a bit of fog though. The aesthetic of this game is a sweeping victory for minimalism. It also somehow reminds me of the classic Russian cartoon 'Ёжик в тумане' - http://ria.ru/infografika/20151211/1340103447.htmlAlthough seemingly a very simple game, I can imagine lots of work was put into its mechanics. It tickles the brain in a good way seeing objects keep their momentum like in the real world and some of the puzzles are quite delightful physics wise.Sadly though, Puzzle and Platformer are among my most disliked genres and I'm going to have to go with a negative here, since there's no in-between. I don't think I've even played Super Mario for longer than 30 minutes at a time, so it's not that Limbo is a bad game, I just generally don't like it's ilk and find that there's tons of better stuff to spend my precious few gaming hours on.

												This is the ""Shadow of the Colossus"" of Indie games. I mean it. No, you don't ride a horse around and stab through giants. But this comparison to Limbo is justified in another way. This is a staple for Indie games. This is video game art. Like Shadow of the Colossus on the Playstation 2, Limbo tells gamers that a game can be beautiful, mysterious, and a subtle, yet deep tale about what one would do to bring back the one they hold dear.It took me about three hours to beat this game. The average gamer could probably beat it in 3-4 hours. But that's really not a big deal, because the ""puzzles"" are so intuitive and the overall game is so beautiful in its simplicity that it demands another playthrough. Not verbally, but I simply doubt that one's heart could bear abandoning this game after the first playthrough.9.3/10. A must have.			"

												Go right, find puzzle, die, repeat until you find the arbitrary, non-intuitive solution; whole game can be summed by that. Controls are simple in a bad way (oversimplified I think it's the term), and you often find yourself just hitting action everywhere in the hopes that you will find the place devs want you to hit. There is zero learning curve, as in, unlike games such as Portal where mechanics are explained in a non-hamfisted way, every puzzle expects you to already know and master the mechanics of it, and timing slightly short than perfect means doing everything over again. There is little sense of achievement, and you feel like you just finished a tedious chore, rather than you solved an intrincate puzzle. Probably didn't get to the part where you could get any sense of story, narrative, or anything at all that makes you feel SOMETHING for your character, other than ""you can drown in 3' of water? Whoa you're useless kid"".Also unlike Portal (ik, but it's the gold standard for puzzle platforming) there are no multiple approaches for a problem either, just find the one, cookie cutter solution, keep going right and that's that. Really no incentive whatsoever to keep playing, will probably watch someone doing some highlights on YouTube. One of those games where watching someone else play doesn't make you say ""damn I want to get my hands on that!"", but instead feels like ""eh, think I got the whole experience from watching that"". Goes to show me that I must play whatever I buy right away, before refund window closes.			"

												I realize the game is a little dated, being from 2011 and all. It has been rotting in my library since then, but today I finally had time to play it.This game is alright. It's a short story about a boy wandering through a forest and being victim of all kinds of bad stuff.He also solves puzzles along the way, which never become much more interesting than pushing a block onto a switch. So it's basically the first test chamber of Portal 1, drawn out over multiple hours of gameplay. The game looks pretty nice, with the dynamic lighting and all. It stands out in its own way. The enemies and surroundings are subtly animated, but that's about it. It's mostly a black and white flickering experience.The puzzle gameplay is okay-ish. There are a lot of non-intuitive puzzles, which means that you will die on your first try. This trial-and-error gameplay is just game length padding. Were these puzzles designed in a better way, then the game would be twice as short and twice as exciting.The rest of the game is platforming. This is also okay, not great. The character feels sluggish, but none of the platforming segments require good timing or mechanics anyway. It's hard to say whether this is on purpose to hide the poor controls, but it occasionally looks that way.What bothers me greatly is how incompetent the character is. You can literally pull a minecart towards you on a flat road and die that way. You can't fall very far, which is a very strange mechanic for a platformer. If they were going for realism, then...they just didn't do a good job.In terms of art and uniqueness and whatever, yeah, there are some elements of that in here as well. It feels too forced to me, but I'm sure some people like this sort of approach. In conclusion, I wish there was a meh option instead of a Yes/No recommendation. Sure, I'll recommend this for when it's 75% off during a sale, but please don't buy it at full price. For the less than 3 hours of puzzle platformer gameplay, you can spend your 10 bucks in infinitely better ways.			"

												This is one of those games that has sat in my Steam library for years in the 'Another Artsy Indie Game I'll Try Someday' category.And now I wish I had tried it sooner.The first time your character gets decapitated by a bear trap, you will feel a tingle up your spine. When the spider catches you and spins you into its web, you will shudder with revulsion. When you finally (and brutally) tear the final leg from the spider's  body, you will marvel at how satisfying such a gruesome act could be.And all this is after just 48 minutes of playing the game! Any game that can tap my emotions so deftly will earn a resounding recommendation from me, regarless of how good/bad/ugly those emotions happen to be. Bonus points for acheiving this feat in such a minimalist environment with no vocals/text or any other in-game guidance (other than said environment itself).Final thought: I don't enjoy horror games. While this game has caused me to feel terror, I don't clasify it as 'horror'. This game is not violent or scary for the sake of being violent/scary, but uses the induced emotional state as a mechanic within the game (although you may not realize this at first).Duly recommended.

												When this game came out, there probably weren't a whole lot of quality original indie games to choose from, or so it seems, as critics basically creamed their pants and showered endless praise over this one. However, the game is severely overrated. The visuals are quite good and the atmosphere is by far the game's strongest suit. It's actually very immersive and unsettling, especially when wearing a decent pair of headphones, but that's where my praise ends.The gameplay, the most important part of any indie game, falls flat on its face here. Instead of ingenious level design that constantly thrills you and keeps you glued to your controller like true indie masterpieces such as Shovel Knight and Freedom Planet, the game shoves moronic trial-and-error gameplay in your face at every moment. It tries too hard to be the Demon's Souls of platformers and just ends up being a complete bore full of cheap, unavoidable deaths, and a lackluster sense of progression. After a strong opening, everything starts to feel the same relatively fast and you're then left with a very unfulfilling experience. That is, if you're able to force yourself all the way to the abrupt ending like I did, and saying I had to force myself to complete it is really an understatement, but since the game was recently given away for free and I always finish everything I start, I figured why not. If you like gorgeous looking indie games with cheap, artificial difficulty, lack of story, and mundane puzzles, this is the game for you. For everyone else, check out an overlooked indie gem like Shadow Blade: Reload instead that actually respects your time as a gamer. I guarantee you'll have a lot more fun.			"

												Like this game provides no text explanations or cutscenes for the plot, I have no right words to discribe what it is like. Limbo - a place on the edge of Hell, full of symbolism and allusions. The path, fear of darkness, insects, of coming water, sharp edges, fear of changes and inevitable death. Fear of meeting with someone beloved. Something that you've almost reached but slips away as soon as you approach. Limbo has it all and even more, it is possible to search for second, third and so on meaning of each aspect of the game.Open ending is a proof of how more important the path you've traveled comparing to the outcome.You don't even have to understand the events in the game, you have to feel it. It leaves both charming and sad feeling in my soul and that is something I appreciate the most.LIMBO presents both outstanding visuals and brilliant game mechanics. This game is one solid proof that ""Games are an Art"". Excellent art in this case.I'M STRONGLY RECOMMENDING IT TO EVERYONE.			"

The artstyle is black & white, but the sound is rather realistic than what you could consider 'old-styled'.Sometimes, certain actions can happen out of nowhere and jump-scare you, it has happened to me quite some times, but unlike other games like Five Nights at Freddy's where the jumpscares are cheap and badly-formatted (except for the second game), in Limbo you have to take notice not to repeat that again, in order to continue.Only problem I have found on my mac is the resolution, but maybe that's because I have a 27"" screen.Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10, and I definetly recommend that you should check it out. Definetly worth the 10 euros.			"

												This is one of those games that has simple gameplay and controls, but it's very well done.  The graphics are fantastic with the gloomy, moody, and sometimes disturbing atmosphere.  The background music and sounds add to everything.  I've played through this twice now.  It's not a long game, but it's a good length for the ""story"".  The puzzles are challenging, but not frustrating.  Highly recommended!			"

												Limbo is a great game and I recommend it to everyone willing to challenge their mind.Limbo delievers it's dark moody art style and mind boggling puzzels. Some puzzels may leave you confused for awhile as they did for me, but eventually you will figure it out, and the feeling of completing a hard puzzel is quite satisfying.The game also manages to be unpredictable. Occasionally dropping in a new feature in, to either make gameplay harder or rarely easier. I would consider my self a fps player more than anything else but I still enjoyed this game. Sometimes you have to leave the game and come back to it later and I recommend that so the game feels longer.I had a lot of fun with Limbo and I recommend it to everyone, especially people who like puzzels!

												Who needs colors when you have atmosphere?There is no dialogue, you go in clueless.NO LOADING TIMES. It loads fully on startup. It's a continuous game; it doesn't seperate the levels.The puzzles themselves are genius. Some require you to do something ahead of time before you can do the initial thing.As all puzzle games do, this one really makes you think.There are a variety of challenges: Some physics based, some timed, and some you just get lucky on.The replay value in this game is to collect all the 'eggs' to get a secret achievement ""DING"" and just the achievements in general.8/10 Great looking monochrome game, and plays well too.

												Limbo is a very relaxing puzzle adventure that should take you less than 4 hours to complete. It's a fine example of what I would call a worthy Indie title to play.Despite the art work being nothing more than a silhouette, there is a lot of body language in the animations. There's also a lot of camera zooming in/out/panning smoothly and some nice background shadows all of which when combined create a peaceful yet creepy atmosphere. The creepy mood is also reflected within the music ambience and sound effects.There is a bit of some ragdoll-like physics, but thankfully this doesn't take complete control over the gameplay (or I would go nuts). I think what I like the most is that throughout the game, there are some pretty crafty puzzles. Maybe throughout the game you'll encounter about four puzzles that might make you scratch your head for about 20 mins each, but not long enough to get you frustrated. The rest of the puzzles are easy but not made to make you feel like a fool. My rule of thumb is, if you seem to get stuck, always head backwards to find something to bypass the obstacle ahead.Limbo is the perfect title for this game as well. Story-wise it's like you're living in a nightmare. There are some things going on. 1/3 of the game is like a spider chasing you. 1/3 feels like you walked into land owned by a nasty tribe. 1/3 is like a saw mill filled with so many death traps. Death seems to be a common occurrence and theme within this game.As a kid, I never liked games where you are chased by an invincible enemy or unstoppable force. And the only direction you can travel is forward. I dunno, maybe I got traumatized as a kid when the planet Zebes blew up in Super Metroid and you had to run away from the lava. In Limbo, the unstoppable force happens to be the big♥♥♥♥♥spider! But it's not so hard and doesn't happen frequently. So that's still alright. Unfortunately just like Hotline Miami, for some reason my Steam Achievements aren't being saved. I've had the ""The End - Where Credit Is Due"" achievement pop up for example, but it hasn't been recorded/saved to my profile. This is more of a Steam problem I would say.All in all, I would recommend this game if you can get it on discount.			"

												The best way I can describe this game is ""captivatingly haunting"".  The stark minimalist presentation works very well given the setting.  The puzzle aspect is difficult, but not frustratingly so.  You will die a lot, and cringe every time, but you won't be tearing your hair out either.  The payoff for making it through the whole mess is pretty satisfying too, though much like the rest of the game its somewhat cryptic. Still, the entire sequence at the conclusion of the last puzzle is something I will remember forever.			"

You find yourself wondering what in the hell will come next!.No music, black, white and greys. Seems sterile but, It's a bag of fun, and leaves you with mixed feelings (black and white), you hate it and love it at same time, is uggly and beautiful at same time, paceful and disturbing...

												An artistic independant game seeped in melancholy and a general aire of despair and struggle. It is displayed in a minimalistic, monochrome format, with no dialogue, music, or text; and yet it still conveys strong emotional tone that permeates the short play-length of this title. The weakness of the main character and violent depictions of his death in this uncomfortable world really lend to the atmosphereThe actual gameplay revolves around physics-based puzzles in a 2D portrayal with no introduction and a ""figure it out yourself"" motivation that most companies are afraid to try. No tutorial and no introduction make this a game for the clever.With no replay value to speak of, this game is one that, while definitely worth the play-through, is neatly concluded as a hypothetical story to talk about, and reflect on withouth having to experience a second or third time through.For the discounted price, at 3 hours, I've paid more for movies from which I get less.

												It is hard to find a flaw on LIMBO. It throws you in a game without any kind of tutorial or even hints at controls, but it actually makes the grim atmosphere even better, as you have to learn by trial and error. You will die, a lot.Atmosphere is perfect, dark and spooky. Story begins, and ends, without any explanation, but you are able to piece a lot together from subtle hints along the road. The ending is open for interpretation and intentionally so.LIMBO is probably my second favourite indie game and one of the few videogames I would dare call Art.Equip yourself with a bit of imagination and a bit more patience and try it out. Try it. Now.Why aren't you playing yet?(note: to dispel possible doubts, I have almost no playtime recorded, but I have beaten it twice)			"

												LIMBO is everything an indie game should be. Today, games are often made simply because they will sell. Games with huge budgets, top-notch graphics, and the most advanced AI can make millions of dollars and yet only provide the player with a lifeless experience. LIMBO puts you in a world that is devoid of color, music, and narrative and yet proves to be entertaining, challenging, and able to invoke emotion in the player. LIMBO is a puzzle-platformer with very simple controls. It doesn't give you a tutorial or hold your hand. It drops you in a lonely and hostile environment and let's you figure out for yourself how to advance and how to survive. The controls are tight and the puzzles are creative and challenging without being too frustrating. You'll never be scratcing your head for too long and finding the solution to a puzzle is always satisfying. Some may complain about the trial and error process of dying and retrying. I felt that this helped to enrich the dark atmosphere with a genuine sense of peril which is very important to the game. From beginning to end, the player feels a sense of helplessness. Even though our protagnist is silent, we can sense that he is lost and confused by his hostile surroundings. This makes the need to solve puzzles all the more necessary to the player as these small victories are what drive the player to move forward and discover the secrets of this strange and beautiful black-and-white world. 10/10 "

												An amazing game that will keep you in fear and misery throughout the whole experience. The artstyle is black & white, but the sound is rather realistic than what you could consider 'old-styled'.Sometimes, certain actions can happen out of nowhere and jump-scare you, it has happened to me quite some times, but unlike other games like Five Nights at Freddy's where the jumpscares are cheap and badly-formatted (except for the second game), in Limbo you have to take notice not to repeat that again, in order to continue.Only problem I have found on my mac is the resolution, but maybe that's because I have a 27"" screen.Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10, and I definetly recommend that you should check it out. Definetly worth the 10 euros.			"

												LIMBO is a prime example of Indie games gone right. Fluid gameplay, dark undertones, and a varied mix of difficult puzzles will keep players at their peak interest long after the game is over. However it’s also the game’s major downfall. The game is too damn short, especially for it’s 10 dollar price range. Collectibles hidden in dark paths aren’t enough to keep players playing. However, this shouldn’t sway you from picking it up, as LIMBO will be stuck in your head for years.			"

												A great puzzle based platformer. Its black and white visuals and no ost creates a spooky atmosphere that is very hard to find in a platform game.Recommended for every fan of this genre.			"

												Limbo is the kind of small gem you may find in gaming. Very simple to play yet addictive, the overall feeling is great, very atmospheric and compeling. This game mix puzzle and platform, with a bit of horror in the background. The whole ""greyshading"" visual aspect fits very well the purpose of the game. I really enjoyed it and I strongly advise you to play it. 10/10			"

												Wow!  This is a great 2-D puzzle game!  The game does not take very long to complete and the puzzles are just hard enough to keep you interested but not frustrated.  I was able to beat this game in a couple of sittings and was pleased with the ability to In-Home Stream Limbo to my Ubuntu 12.04 Linux Steam system.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys 2-D puzzles games.			"

												An amazing game that will keep you in fear and misery throughout the whole experience. The artstyle is black & white, but the sound is rather realistic than what you could consider 'old-styled'.Sometimes, certain actions can happen out of nowhere and jump-scare you, it has happened to me quite some times, but unlike other games like Five Nights at Freddy's where the jumpscares are cheap and badly-formatted (except for the second game), in Limbo you have to take notice not to repeat that again, in order to continue.Only problem I have found on my mac is the resolution, but maybe that's because I have a 27"" screen.Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10, and I definetly recommend that you should check it out. Definetly worth the 10 euros.			"

												This is one of those games that has simple gameplay and controls, but it's very well done.  The graphics are fantastic with the gloomy, moody, and sometimes disturbing atmosphere.  The background music and sounds add to everything.  I've played through this twice now.  It's not a long game, but it's a good length for the ""story"".  The puzzles are challenging, but not frustrating.  Highly recommended!			"

												It's one of those games that can go on your bloody nerves from time to time, but it's got soul and atmosphere (which many games lack nowadays) and manages to tell a great story without any character ever saying a word. Would recommend for every puzzle platform fan or any casual gamer.9/10			"

												Who needs colors when you have atmosphere?There is no dialogue, you go in clueless.NO LOADING TIMES. It loads fully on startup. It's a continuous game; it doesn't seperate the levels.The puzzles themselves are genius. Some require you to do something ahead of time before you can do the initial thing.As all puzzle games do, this one really makes you think.There are a variety of challenges: Some physics based, some timed, and some you just get lucky on.The replay value in this game is to collect all the 'eggs' to get a secret achievement ""DING"" and just the achievements in general.8/10 Great looking monochrome game, and plays well too.
