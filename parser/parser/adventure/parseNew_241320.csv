												This is one of the best puzzle games I've played. Thanks to some ingenius design, the puzzle's difficulty scales with you, but in a very natural way. You can choose to get all the items before completing the game, which will give you more options to solve each situation. But the game is designed that you can beat the game without all the items if you want an extra challenge. And if you, like me, want the extra extra challenge, there's optional puzzles and dungeons that will make you feel dumb for hours while you try everything, before you finally get your EUREKA moment, then you feel like the smartest person in the world. On top of the great game design, the charming art and writing is perfect bonus that ties the game all together.Highly recommended!!			"

												Although pitched as a Zelda parody, dismissing Ittle Dew as such would be doing it a disservice. While the delightful art style and fantastic soundtrack both pay homage to the classic series, the similarities in actual gameplay are rather cursory and it turns out that's a good thing.The emphasis here is entirely on the puzzles, more specifically, block puzzles. You'll spend nearly your entire stay on the island pushing, freezing, and teleporting blocks and enemies around, flipping switches and ultimately opening a ton of chests and doors on your quest for treasure. As the sole focus of the adventure the quality of the puzzles is paramount, and fortunately they happen to be supremely well designed and satisfying to solve, rarely crossing the line into overly hard nor easy. They provide an entertaining challenge as well as a bit of replayability with several different paths available for completing the game, something that's rarely seen in this genre.All of this combined with the clever boss fights, tongue in cheek humor, and outstanding presentation add up to a very short but (technical hiccups aside) immensely enjoyable game from start to finish. Don't make the mistake of taking Ittle Dew at face value, for it has more than enough heart to breakaway from it's inspiration, and should not be missed!			"

												A wonderful homage to the Zelda franchise. Ittle Dew features an amazing amount of well thought and tricky puzzles. A huge amount of time and love went into crafting and polishing this game.Side note: Ittle Dew was actually submitted as an idea to Nintendo as a Zelda spinoff, but they turned it down. Which is really too bad for them as this would have fit in with any of the Wind Waker style of Zelda games.Probably for the best really, a lot of the charm of Ittle Dew comes from the aesthetic as a Zelda parody, from poking fun at the goofy statues to the over the top silly monsters.Really, the only thing I'd want out of Ittle Dew is a little more content, your first playthrough will top out at 90 to 150 minutes of play. However, there are multiple ways to finish the game, which can lead to a lot of replay value.But that said, Ittle Dew is very much worth your time and money if you are a fan of puzzle games.Thanks.

												Love this game.  Once you've played it through once it may seem like the replay value isn't there, but beating the game with different combinations of tools and crunching your brain to figure out shortcuts makes it something I'll continue to come back to.  The master's cave makes the normal game seem like child's play as well.  The characters are quirky and fun, and if you've played any of the old Zelda series you'll get a kick out of the homages paid.			"

												There's this time in everyone life where after a very long time you find something precious. That precious thing captivates your soul and mind.  For me, it was this game. First time in my gaming history I managed to complete a game in 1 playthrough without getting bored for a single second.  It was like a time warp.  Anyways, lets quit the drama and let me present you with a Short, sweet review just like the game.  Pros:+ Amazing gameplay. It's downright fun.+ Cleverly designed puzzles....+ The puzzles are not super hard niether are they super easy....+ It's a perfect mixture of hard yet non-frustating puzzle. Exactly what I look for in a VIDEO GAME.+ Short and nice story. It's not bland like other puzzle games.+ It's not serious either, the mood is quite humours and vibrant.+ The game does not overstay it's welcome....+ Fun fact: You can finish the game in under 15 minutes.+ It offers pretty good replaybility....+ It's highly likely that you won't solve all the puzzles in your first playthrough....+ There are 3 different ways to play this game. (Each of which grants a different achievement too)Cons:- There was only exactly ONE situation where I thought the game/floor/level design could have been better. - And that's an extremely low number for a puzzle game. (or any game tbh)I got this game as a gift from a friend who bought it from humble bundle for $1.00 along with a couple of other games. But I'd say this game is worth it's full price if you're a completionist. If not, it's still worth picking up on -50% or less.			"

												On the surface Ittle Dew looks like a Zelda clone. Playing as a blonde in a green tunic with a sword (or stick), stuck on an island with a flying friend and top down gameplay doesn't help make it not look like a Zelda clone. That's the flavor of the game. Is it Zelda? No, but it'll do (Ittle Do). This game is slightly different than a Zelda clone because it is a push block puzzle game with a few enemies and deviations from push block puzzles. There are a few items and you start with a stick that you can use to light on fire, then melt ice blocks, set off bombs and so on. Eventually you'll move to a flaming sword to do what a flaming stick can, a magical teleportation wand that allows you to set a block, use the wand and have the enemy or object appear where you set the block. Finally, you'll get an ice wand to freeze enemies, blocks, put out fire and even make walls reflect projectiles like your teleportation staff. You can tell a lot of work went into making the items as not just items to solve puzzles, but combat items as well. You can use the teleporation block to set a block under you, step off and if an enemy is on it, the enemy will fly off screen. You can set a block, push it onto spikes, then use the teleportation wand to teleport the enemy into the block on the spikes, killing them that way. Even though it is disguised as Zelda, I feel like the game could have been made in RPG Maker.All of the items and weapons are bound to buttons on the X-Box controller which is nice, you can use everything at once without having to visit a menu. There are no deaths in this game, so much as there are room restarts. When you die, you just reset whatever room you were in with full health. Rooms including sections of the overworld map. There is no consequence, making it a very easy for kids game. Each room has a hint sign or two and if you need even more help, you can hit the left button to have your fluttering fox friend give you a hint. There is even a nice little map too showing you where treasures and doors are (unlocked and locked).This is an enjoyable game even if its quick and simple when compared to Zelda. There is a good diverse array of enemies with different ways to take them out. The art style is charming, there is plenty of exploration and a slightly open world go where you want feel. The art style, happy nature, hints and ease of puzzles makes me feel this game is better for kids. Give it a go, its fun for a few brief hours until you complete it in one or two sittings. The game is so brief, there are achievements for beating it under 3 hours and completing it under 15 minutes.Ittle Dew is a good stepping stone for this developer to make a grander Zelda like game.

												Ittle Dew isn't a superbly brilliant game or a mind-blowing experience, but the way the items interact to let you solve the same puzzles in different ways is pretty smart.Ittle Dew is a fun but short adventure. It has a good sense of humour, good puzzles, and lots of opportunities to replay: There are alternate paths (""Professional shortcuts"") and you can try to beat it without all the items. It took me 3h but apparently you can finish in 15 minutes. Most of that doesn't matter to me since I'm not interested in speed running. I still enjoyed my time with Ittle Dew and might come back to it.			"

												The generally accepted reason for why there aren’t more games like The Legend Of Zelda is that they’re just too hard to make. Ocarina Of Time is still widely accepted as the best game ever made, but that in itself implies that its creation was not a trivial task. There have been attempts to copy the formula, from early titles like Golden Axe Warrior through to Alundra, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Ōkami, but not only are these efforts rare but they’ve generally been commercial failures.That is likely to be the real reason for the lack of similar games, but such market realities are not something that indie developers generally worry about. Which is good because, despite a few caveats, Ittle Dew is one of the most enjoyable Zelda-a-likes we’ve played in years.Despite what it may look like Ittle Dew is not a straight clone, but it does have perhaps the most legitimate excuse for copying another game: comedy. Ittle Dew isn’t just a love letter to the Zelda games it’s also a parody of them, and its spunky heroine Ittle and her Navi stand-in Tippsie (a wonderfully cynical magic fox) gently poke fun at the series’ specific peculiarities and those of gaming in general.Tippsie in particular is hilarious, as she reacts with varying degrees of disgust to ordinary Zelda tropes, such as Ittle eating a heart to get more health to her quaffing potions when she’s not looking. Joking about smashing pots and what enemies do all day as they stand around in lonely dungeons may seem like obvious targets, but as we’ve often lamented games are strangely reticent to ever poke fun at their sillier traditions.The jovial mood is enhanced further by the wonderful visuals, but despite the art style being very different from any official Zelda game overall Ittle Dew still ends up looking lawyer-worryingly similar. The game is scheduled for release on Wii U later in the year though so we assume that Nintendo gets the joke as well.Ittle has a much more mercenary approach to her explorations than Link, happily stuffing her pockets with treasure as she goes about adventuring. Even the artefact she’s trying to obtain from a nearby castle is only to bribe a shopkeeper to build her a ship to get home. Although he does at least offer to sell her three items vital to her mission: a fire sword, an ice wand, and a portal-creating magic wand.Unusually for a Zelda game these are the only three items in the whole game, which is certainly a bold choice. But despite all the puzzles being solved using only one or more of the items it’s disappointing that the meat of most of them still revolves around pushing blocks and hitting switches. In the traditional manner there are torches and bombs to be lit, pressure pads to stand on, and doors to unlock. The puzzles might not be very imaginative but they are well designed and often have multiple solutions. You can even beat the entire game using any random combination of just two of the items. Some of the puzzles are very hard but the game isn’t interested in punishing you, only challenging you, and there’s a wide range of helpful hints given out by Tippsie.The dungeon-like areas are very much the focus of the game and although there are overworld areas they’re smaller and less interactive than real Zelda games. The combat is also significantly less interesting, being barely any more nuanced than the original NES game and offering zero reward beyond extra health. The bosses are a mostly decent bunch though and also get some of the best lines.Ittle Dew is rather short, at around three to four hours, although you’ll need much longer to collect everything and beat the optional Master Cave (the only truly difficult challenge in the whole thing). But for only a tenner you get a download that is not only fun but funny – a game that is amusingly self-aware but uses this as a means to enhance the experience and not just make excuses for it.Recommended "

												Fun Zelda-esque Puzzle Adventure GameThis is NOT an RPG. It's a cute adventure game focused strictly on solving puzzles. You solve one, open the door, move to the next room and so on. The only few rpg elements include things like health upgrades and cash to buy items (3 items that open up more puzzle mechanics).PROS- Lovely art style and animation, very fitting.- The writing is really fun. Expect lots of snarky comments and quirky dialogues.- The base game is challenging enough for casual playthroughs. There's an optional ""dungeon"" full of super hard puzzles for the aditional challenge- 60fps goodness, runs so smoothCONS- All the puzzles in game revolve around box pushing mechanics. Provides a good challenge but could get boring after a while.- Lack of exploration- I wish the characters had more story or progression, loved all of them.- Not much replayability unless you want the achievements, most of which are rerunning the game with some sort of handicap.- The game is short (my first blind playthrough was 2:30 hours, got all collectables and completed the extra hard dungeon too)SUMIf you like puzzlers and don't mind lots of box pushing, you'll love it. The humour is great and the game is very pretty to look at. The puzzles can get extremely difficult (even convoluted) and provide a great challenge. If you're into speedrunning the game's got that too.			"

 Playtime and Time/money 10-20 hours of play which is about $1/hour or 50 cents an hour. it's not that great but it is only 10$ for an excellent game. Exactly what is this game?  The Good: This is my favorite hidden gem game ever, it has an amazing artstyle, a cast of cute characters, a difficult puzzle style for people to enjoy and a fun atmosphere to the game in general. It has many different ways to play the game, you could skip over getting x item if you just are using your resources right etc. it's honestly just a whole load of fun. The Bad: It's a somewhat short game, but theres a lot you can do in the game so it should still be considered fine. Ittle dew 2 improves on this by adding several more dungeons. (and I assume, ways to play the game)So now the standard game rating:Story: 9/10 (it's silly, it's fun, it's the kind of story that doesnt take it'self too seriously and in general just a lighthearted approach, that said it doesnt have some deep engaging story to it so I can't give it some sort of perfect score comparing it to something like transistor.)Gameplay: 10/10 + 🎮 + 📱 (Very smooth, very fun to master and I'd suggest using a controller, as it is an option and to me just feels right for this game.) (just so you know they also have this game as an app for smartphones, so if you feel like it you could check it out on that platform - it plays fine everywhere)Presentation: 10/10 (I'm absolutely in love with the art style that this game has, and I enjoy how all the main enemies are creative and fun and very jenny. you'll grow to love certain characters in ludosity's universe of games and you'll want to play some of their other games.)Soundtrack: 10/10 (It's honestly just good fitting music thats also memorable, and didn't get old. I loved it.)Replayability: 9/10 (Theres a certain point where you cannot do the game a different way, but thats an achievement on it's own to play the game out. I've seen people speed running this game, and I've seen people try taking really odd routes that seemed like fun overall, if you want to play it more you can, for a very long time.) "

												I give this game a very cautious recommendation.I picked it up because I'm a huge Zelda fan, and it was on sale at the time. The gameplay is similar to a 2D Zelda in many regards in that you explore, fight, and solve puzzles using your trusty stick/sword and items that you gain throughout your adventure. So yes, there are a lot of familiar elements here if you like these kinds of games.That said, it doesn't PLAY like a Zelda game. That's not necessarily a bad thing depending on why you enjoy these games in the first place. Whereas Zelda has very tight, simple combat and excellent monster design, it becomes apparent soon after starting this game that combat is not the main focus. Ittle's stick has a short range and some enemies do not suffer knockback when hit. There are also not many enemies with unique weaknesses. Most of them are a simple hack n' slash affair.Where this game truly shines is in the puzzle department. I would even say that this game is more of a puzzle game than a 2D adventure game, because the world is compact and filled to the brim with puzzles. Many of them are actually challenging! I literally spent hours in the Master Cave, an optional dungeon filled with the toughest puzzles that this game has to offer, because the puzzles were so difficult and I was determined to solve them without a guide. Though I felt like ripping my hair out at the time, solving these complex puzzles was a rewarding experience in and of itself, unlike in Zelda dungeons where it sometimes feels like puzzles are just there to pad the game out.This is a short game, and there are only three items (besides the default stick) that you can obtain. The twist is that these items work together to help you solve puzzles and traverse the main dungeon. For instance, you can combine the portal wand and the ice rod to create an ice block that warps you to the other side of the room. This part of the game was handled ingeniously. There are so many things you can do with these three items and the objects in your environment. There are also multiple ways that you can beat the game, and you don't even need all of the items to do it. Pretty cool!As mentioned, this game is short. If you skipped the Master Cave, it would likely take you about 3-5 hours on your first attempt. The replay value comes from finding out different ways to beat the game using different combinations of items. The game is also uniformly hilarious and aware of its genre. Even the credit sequence is funny.TL;DR - This is more of a puzzle game than a 2D adventure game. If you like puzzles, you will probably like it.			"

												I've had this game sitting on my wishlist for quite awhile, but I got overspendy with steam-sale-madness and this was part of my purchase tornado. I am SO GLAD I ended up finally buying Itlle Dew! Totally has a Wind Waker vibe visually, and plays like the original legend of zelda with a top down view, grottos with treasure, dungeons with bosses and a handful of key weapons that you need to progress. The puzzles are a perfect ratio of frustrating:gratifying and, the game has no lives/game over system which, for me, was very motivating. All you have to sit through when you run out of health is a seconds long die animation and then it's back to entrance of whatever room you are in- it really helps keep me in a puzzle solving mindframe instead of getting a wave of frustration that tempts my ""alt-f4"" impulse (or command-q for the angsty apple user). If you've considered buying this game, please buy it- especially if you derive any joy at all from the legend of zelda series. Buy now! Its da bes.			"

												I don't think I've ever seen a game that lived up to its name so perfectly. It's not amazing, the gameplay is incredibly shallow*, and if you've ever played a top-down Zelda title you'll probably get the ""finish in under 3 hours"" achievement easily. But on the other hand, the animation's stellar, the music... I've forgotten the music, actually, and some of the jokes had me cracking a smile. It is absolutely a middle-of-the-road game. It'll do.* Yes, there are the 'challenges' you can take on, like the cave full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-hard puzzles, or beating the game with only two items instead of 3, or speedrunning it. But they don't change that every room you'll encounter comes down to ""how do I get these blocks/bombs onto those buttons/cracks"" or ""how do I kill everyone in this room"".			"

												Ittle Dew is not only a clever name, but a very clever game. It takes Zelda's block pushing, torch lighting, and enemy managing puzzles to a point where they actually take some thought. The main game can take as long or little as you want; it took me about six hours to explore the entire castle and collect most of the cards, but the game can be completed in under 15 minutes (thank you, achievements, for pointing that out). Furthermore, you technically only need two of the game's three items to complete the game, a feat accomplished by clever level design, multiple routes, and puzzles with multiple solutions. Each item is functionally very different from the others, so puzzles that are easy when you have the teleport wand may be really challenging without it.There are also two levels in the world that only exist to offer more challenging puzzles to those that want them. I found them to be really enjoyable, but I'm happy that they are optional.The game's art is simple yet clear, and it gives the game's characters plenty of personality. The dialogue is witty and occasionally pokes fun at game tropes, though I wish there was an option to disable the dialogue for future playthroughs.			"

												Ittle Dew is a puzzle game in the same way of Zelda or Goof Trop (SNES). Pull blocks, explode, reflect, teleport, freeze, fire... Use your mind to pass every single puzzle in every dungeon.The only cons is that the story is too short, 4 hours for a full 100% walkthrough.And a puzzle editor would make this game perfect.Recommended for the people that don't have much time to spend.

												Ittle Dew is a little game that stands somewhere between Zelda and Sokoban, with a very humorous tone, and featuring friendly game design, with aspects that can be appreciated by pretty much everyone.From casual playthroughs, so rock-hard puzzles and 15 minutes speedruns... it's got it all! It's weird, but it's very nice to see how almost every aspect of this game seems to just fit it and provide a great experience, despite its apparent simplicity!PresentationUndoubtedly, one of its strongest aspects, especially at first. The cartoon-y artstyle is very well done, with a pleasant color scheme, very clean, with added lighting effects modernising its look, somewhat. The highlight here for me, though, is the character design. Everyone looks unique, is a clumsy and silly way, and with their own backstory to support them. It's pretty good! Another detail I liked is how every line moves slightly, making everything seem more alive.The music and sound-effects didn't standout out too much for me, but fit nicely with the rest of the presentation, and it wasn't bad by any means! Just didn't seem to carry the experience, for me.I also found the writting to be funny at times, and it just gave the game a very light-hearted and self-aware tone the whole way through. Ranging from the dialogues with your health-potion drunk companion, to the enemies' entrances and the mocking signposts spread around, everything had something to make fun of.How's the game structured?Very much like a Zelda game, actually. You have an island to explore, and go through several dungeons to beat it. There is also some exploration done outside the main and tutorial dungeons.Near the beginning of the game, you'll find a shop. The shopkeeper tells you he can give you a raft to escape the island, if you get him the artifact in the castle. And off you go. He also has 3 items to sell. You'll find the gold for it in the castle. The game's puzzles revolve around these 3 items: you'll have to combine their abilities in very varied ways to solve the puzzles.The castle has many shortcuts, that you can take by solving much harder puzzles. If you're stuck, you may as well try another way, or go buy another item. There are many different ways of making progress, too!The castle puzzles are pretty straighforward, though, so anyone can safely play it without fearing getting frustrated.Outside the castle, though, there are other smaller dungeon, with harder puzzles. These usually contain Cards with the game's characters. These are merely collectibles, but they're pretty charming too. The puzzles there can also hint at some mechanics you may have not learned throw the tutorial puzzles. As a segue, when you have enough gold, you can take one of several portals spread around the castle to fast travel. When you buy an item, you'll be catapulted into another part of the island. These are the tutorial areas. Your items are all stored near the shop, and you'll have to beat the dungeon only with your newfound item. With this, you'll learn how the item works well enough, and do that through play! I think it's a nice way of doing it.These dungeons also contain several paths and shortcuts. One important thing is that you'll never be able to leave the cave while missing important items. When you leave the dungeon, it will be sealed, but you can rest assured that you haven't missed anything important. This is also told to you after your first dungeon, in a sign post. The placing of that was very elegant: since there are multiple paths, it's very likely that you'll miss part of the map, and become worried after leaving the dungeon. Right when you're worrying about it, the signpost clarifies it for you.There are many places like this in the game, making tutorialisation nicely paced. Information is often delivered at the right moment!I think that about covers it.General MechanicsThis game has both combat and puzzles, although the focus is mainly on the puzzles. There are also some Boss Fights, most of which are more puzzle-driven than combat, although both blend rather nicely, items being multi-purposed.The combat is very straightforward. Your basic attack attacks the tile in front of you. There are also projectiles attacks. There are several different enemies, some that attack only in front of them, some have projectiles, etc. Different enemies require different approaches. Also, they'll respawn each time you enter the room, but it's never a problem as they're easy to avoid. Some puzzles also reset, but only when the initial conditions are necessary for you to solve another puzzle in the room (or perhaps to use a shortcut).The only problem I've had with the combat, is how the movement is a bit floaty, and there's a lack of knock-back with some enemies. The enemies often drop hearts to replenish your health, and the game is overall not punishing in the least, so it's not too big of an issue. Lack of PunishmentThat's mostly a good thing, but it sometimes holds the player's hand too much. For example, Boss fights have 3-5 phases, and there's usually a checkpoint between each. I've found that mostly unnecessary, taking the little challenge that they provided. I think boss fights should still be a threat!On the other hand, each time you die, you'll simply reset the room, but never lose progress, or collectibles at all. That's a very welcome thing! It's always annoying to do 4-5 rooms again when you die, or lose progress over a simple miss-step.The puzzles are basically Sokoban, with a few twists. You have 3 items: a Flaming Sword, a Freezing Wand, and a Teleporting Wand.The sword can set bombs on fire, to explode after a few seconds. The Freezing Wand can freeze enemies and blocks (making them very slippery when you push them, and also breakable), and can also freeze a wall, making it reflective.The Teleporting Wand can create a Green block anywhere. If you hit bombs or enemies with the projectile, they'll teleport over to that block. This is basically all you need to know.You combine these techniques with some more subtle quirks to the tiles and timing, and you can be faced with some evil difficult puzzles.Difficulty.Ittle Dew sets its casual from its hardcore puzzlesUsually, to beat the game, you have some fairly easy puzzles. To collect the cards, it's a different matter (although mostly doable). There's a final dungeon with 12 puzzles however, that is really hard! At least for someone inexperienced in Sokoban. I often had to peek into a walkthrough, and was constantly surprised with a new way of combining my items.Precision and Perfection rather than simply solving a puzzleThe problem is that some of these puzzles required extremely precise timing, with the game's controls don't provide very well, in my opinion. Also, these puzzles constantly made you restart at every wrong move. A time rewinding mechanic would be welcome, even if just on this cave. I had to restart these puzzles many times, making it a bit too frustrating. It wasn't just a puzzle to solve, it was something that heavily relied on execution, which I'm not a fan of.Then again, these were completely optional! And the game warned you that they were hard. If you complete it, you'll get some more cards, and also Development info, which is very cool!H.Mention: The castle can be solved with ANY combination of 2 items. I'm very impressed with this! The castle is so nicely designed that you can beat it with any combination of the two items, and the game aknowledges that with achievements. Also for cards, speed, etc.There are many ways of playing Ittle Dew, which is why I think it's a neatly designed game. Many ways that tie together brilliantly!Full Recommendation. Also, check Card City Nights!			"

												Great game where all the puzzles are logical.You can play through the game normaly by getting all of the items, this is the easiest way but the puzzles are still fun.Then you can play through the game with only 2 of the 3 items which is really difficult and really fun for you hardcore players out there! Also there is the mastercave if you like the challenge.Great graphics and music if you like this kind of style.Edit: fixed some grammar.			"

												Ittle Dew feels like a Zelda game but actually has heavy emphasis on solving puzzles by pushing blocks around and using different weapons with abilities to solve the puzzles. The puzzles are very tricky and very well thought out! The graphics and sound for a game like this are excellent. If you're looking for a charming puzzle game that is challenging and is not too long (doing everything can take ~5-6 hours) make sure to give this one a try.			"

												Wow this game was awesome. Hilarious and challenging. It was pretty short (20+ hrs because I left it running in windowed mode accidentally), which I liked. Too much longer would have dragged it on. Master Cave was insanely hard. Couldn't do it without help because none of the situations in the main story made me even think of some of the solutions. I'm be getting the sequel for sure.			"

												Preface: Be advised that this is not a ""Zelda clone"", but it does fall into the ""puzzle dungeon"" genre. It leans heavily into complex single-room puzzles with minimal combat. Contrast this with: Zelda's simpler, but multi-room puzzles, with casual-but-competent combat; and Darksiders' more refined combat and more focus on platforming.Novel and fresh take on an abused and neglected genre.Some highlights of particularly strong game design:* Each puzzle feels fresh. Particularly impressive given the amount of them* Comedic elements are light and witty, without trying to steal focus from the experience* Difficulty curve is smooth, with a good pacing of optional mini-puzzles along a parallel difficulty curve* At end of game, meaningful replay value in the form of multiple ""low %"" completion routes are made clear to the player* Optional end-dungeon ""Master Cave"" adds a new level of complexity to the fundamentals* Game intentionally avoids putting rewards in places that can be missed* No meaningful padding or filler, all content is quickly reachable from the center of the world* Death (though an extremely rare occurence as hazards are not the focus of the game) is not punishing, and just throws the player back at the start of the current room with minimal delay* I'll say it: better puzzle and dungeon design than any Zelda game. Puzzle elements are clearly identifiable, and multi-room puzzles are EXTREMELY rare (and when present, are simply that a room transition is one-way, which is always reasonably obvious)Some nitpicks to improve on:* Zelda Link to the Past has a superior melee attack, in that it hits in a wide arc. Ittle Dew's feels clunky in comparison. Thankfully, combat is not a focus for the vast majority of the game. But...* Final boss has a very ""twitch action-game"" phase when compared to the rest of the game, and thus unfairly gates players to completion by requiring a skillset they didn't sign up for, and the game didn't ramp them up to* ""Master Cave"" boss is devoid of puzzle elements entirely, and REALLY feels out of place in the game as a resultI would consider this game to be mandatory reference material for all developers in the ""puzzle dungeon"" genre.

I whole-heartedly recommend Ittle Dew. I have played it several times and I intend to come back to it more. It is well worth what you pay for it.Ittle Dew is a single-player game which at first glance is very similar to the old NES and SNES Zelda games. That is accurate, but there is a lot more to it.If you play for even a small amount of time, you will notice that Ittle Dew has a great irreverent style of humor which is enhanced by the lovable characters, and the mix of puzzle and combat gameplay suits it perfectly. There is very little fluff - by which I mean you will use the same puzzle elements over again, but in increasingly clever and novel ways. It is clear that the developers (Ludosity) took great care in crafting their game and distilling it down to a small, but densely packed experience that conveys constant quality.There are five boss fights in the game, of which three, including the final boss, are required to beat the main story. A fourth is required to gain all of the items. Each of the three dungeon bosses have specific mechanics which require you to use your new dungeon item as you have learned in the preceding area, creating a diverse experience that never gets tedious. There is also a fifth (tough) boss that is completely optional.Aside from the main story, there is an optional 'Master Cave' with twelve puzzles. They begin slightly more difficult than what you have done to beat the main story, but the difficulty ramps up quickly and some will leave you thinking for a long time before you can beat them. I was amazed at how clever some of the solutions were.If you haven't already, I recommend watching the trailer on the Steam Page - it will show you a good sample of the humor and puzzles you can expect.

												Ittle Dew is a short but humorous Zelda clone that might be worth it on sale for a few bucks. The puzzles are challenging and can be solved in varying ways allowing you to finish the game with or without certain primary items. I happend to finish the game in under 3 hours on my blind playthrough without collecting the last item, so it's really not a lengthy game. It's a fun distraction and only recommended at a deep discount.			"

												Playing through this game was quite relaxing. It's a short game that you can finish in a 'less than 3 hours session'. You mainly progress via completing puzzles and opening doors. The game is really user-friendly: it is filled with tips everywhere. There are enemies to fight but the gameplay is mostly centered around puzzles. The bosses are all cool to fight though. There is a bit of a story too but it's nothing really crazy, it is funny sometimes.Even if the game is short, it has replayability value. Like every dungeons you go has secret paths. You have to complete puzzles to get through those too. They can be pretty hard sometimes. The point of those paths is to speedup your playthrough. I think it's cool that a big part of the game was built around speedrunning it. There is a steam achievement for completing it under 15 minutes. If you want more challenge the game offers it too: 2 optional zones with hard stuff in it.You liked the Zelda games? Like puzzles? Like cute games? Want to laugh a bit? Well get you your wallet and start to play as this pretty female protagonist named Ittle Dew :)7/10			"

												This was an enjoyable dungeon puzzle type game. You go through dungeons mostly solving puzzles, but there is a combat element to the game also. The combat is pretty basic, but you can freeze and teleport enemies in addition to slashing them with your sword. The puzzles are nicely balanced. Nothing was too hard to feel like giving up on and nothing was too easy to get bored on. The only thing I didn't like was the optional Master Cave dungeon. You basically needed a walkthrough to get through most of these. The solution to a lot of the puzzles require doing things that you never did during the main game, but are expected to know about somehow in this dungeon. A few of the puzzles also require fast reflexes instead of just puzzle solving like the rest of the game. It just all felt out of place to me. Overall though, the game was very enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone that likes the puzzle solving in something like The Legend of Zelda games. You can do mostly everything (minus the achievements) in about 7 hours, depending on how quickly you can figure out the puzzles.			"

												It's a trimed down ""Zelda: A Link to the Past"" It only has a handful of items but used them in very complicated ways. That being said it's almost entirly block puzzels, and while there are plenty of puzzles but the fact that they're all block puzzles sometimes made things feel tedious. The combat is pretty bland. It's a glaring weak point for the game. I never felt like I ever accomplished anything through combat. It was just an annoyence to string together more block puzzles.  It's just missing something. I'm not exactly sure what. It's more difficult than a Zelda game but it just doesn't grab my attention like a Zelda would. For what it is it's very well done. It's just lacks something at it's core to really make it a great game. Maybe the combat could be better, maybe the world could be more interesting, But whatever it's missing is integral for what this game wants to be.It'll get you about 4hrs if you really want to find every little treasure. But it got stale for me.			"

												Ittle Dew is a 2D puzzle adventure game. Basically, it's like a 2D Legend of Zelda game with a heavy focus on the puzzles. You're washed up on a mysterious island and, as any good adventurer does, you start to adventure. It's pretty straightforward in terms of adventuring. You go from dungeon to dungeon as they become available to you, work on puzzles with the dungeons in order to complete them, and then receive items to help you progress further. Upon getting an item, you generally are sent to a new area without the other items, forcing you to get acquainted with the new item and its uses before being able to combine the uses of all your items. There are a few optional shortcuts and slightly hidden puzzles you can go after, which is nice for even more puzzle solving. It is also entire possible to complete the game without getting all of the items. You can beat it with a few combinations of a few items. These are reflected in the achivements, but... I'll be honest, I had enough trouble with the main game using everything. There's also some funny little dialogues going on in parts of the game which give it some life and keep things from getting too harsh on your brain. Almost like little rewards for continuing. And there are boss fights which will give some action to your problem solving skills. A nice blend for the game.There are a few downsides though, as all games have. One is that the game is rather short. Most of the playtime here will be from getting stuck on tricky puzzles. There's not much adventuring, as most of the places you go to are rather straightforward and without missable secrets. Even the optional puzzles are pretty easy to find. So I guess there could've been more adventure for my taste. Also, the combat is a little rough. It just feels a bit stiff and non responsive. There's less focus on it, but still, a little more fluidity might have been nice. Not a big deal, though. You can adjust. There were some pretty interesting puzzles, some involving good timing, but the game doesn't do a great job of teaching you the timing based techniques used later in the game. Also, there's an awful lot of block puzzles, so... if you don't like those... stay away.Overall, it's a pretty cool game. Is it worth the ten dollar price tag? Well, if you're a Zelda fan or a puzzle fan, yes. It's definitely worth checking out. For others? Possibly wait for a sale, or just give it a shot. It's a decent price for what you get. It has some neat sound and a fun art style. The music went well the the mood. It's definitely something anyone could enjoy, but recommended for only the Zelda fans or puzzle crowd, I'd say. If you're looking for more adventure, it may not be your cup of tea. And I must say that, even though it is a bit on the short side, it doesn't FEEL short. It feels like a full game, and that's where it counts. I'd give Ittle Dew 7/10. Good, solid game, but geared more towards the puzzle minded for sure.			"

												[Spoiler-Free Review]Sometimes a game's influences are all the review you need.To put it succinctly, Ittle Dew is Indie Zelda and exactly the type of game development you want to be supporting: clever, charismatic, entertaining, and absolutely stunning. The developers clearly demonstrate competence here; If this was the latest iteration in Nintendo's franchise, you'd never guess it was made by anyone else - it's that good.The only contentious aspect for me is the game's length. It's true I finished it in a single sitting, but I was also engaged with the characters and world in a way that made it difficult to put down. I hope the devs continue with the series and create a full-scale experience with their next game - their talents demand it!Ittle Dew is excellent. Don't sit on the fence with this one.			"

												Drawn to it by its art style, the game won me by its quirky sense of humour, skillful breaking of the fourth wall and its soundtrack, seriously, the castle, where you'll probably spend the majority of the time, has a catchy tune, which, you know, is a good thing since spending an hour listening to the same thing can get a tad bit tiring. The makers said the game is designed in a way to allow speed running and it shows, with best times going as low as 10 minutes. This allows many modes of play, adding variety to playthroughs. The items you recieve can be gotten in any order, and you don't even need all of them to complete the story, although catching them all surely helps solving some puzzles. The bosses aren't really given much backstory, as any other character really, but this may have been necessary, seeing as having loads of story in a game this short would detract from the gameplay. However, tidbits of information are scattered throughout the game and reading them adds some depth to the world of Ittle Dew. Some of the harder puzzles can be a little tricky to solve since the game doesn't tell you a couple of abilities one of your items has, nothing that a little thinking wouldn't solve, but seeing each new skill having a small tutorial, one could get a slightly confused. Ittle Dew is an adorable little game that really shows the developers put a lot of care in making it as fun and endearing as possible, while maintaing its unique humour.			"

												A review for this game uhm... uhm... i would say this game is ""3 out of 5 stars at best"". :)Jokes aside, i really enjoyed playing this game, obviously is heavily inspired on Zelda games and that is actually a good thing, it's not a popular genre so it's awesome that we get to play something like that.The humor is simple but effective and will make you smile through the game especially on those parts where it parodies itself and with the situations that you were not expecting (cue to the moment where Tippsie realises what the protagonist is, as well as the gamer).The gameplay is adequate, not really that hard and if you die you will respawn in the same area with full health, the puzzles are somewhere in between, some are easy but others are really hard, either way you will get that moment of victory when you finally complete the puzzle.The game is a little bit short (somewhere between the 4~5 hours depending of how quick you solve the puzzles or if you're trying to find all collectables) but considering the price i would say that is worth it.I will have to say that i'm really glad that i played this, it was a nice surprise and i hope that i see a Ittle Dew 2 (or should i say... Ittle Two? *ba-dum-tss*) in the future, good job developers.			"

												With the sequel confirmed and on the way, getting into Ittle Dew now is the perfect time. I had always meant to play this game but only now did I ever give it the chance. Maybe it was the Adventure Time style and humor that put me off, leading me to believe this game would be a nonsensical game without any logic. It is nosensical, in a good way, but the puzzles and gameplay are finely crafted with various solutions in an otherwise illogical adventure. Wake up, Adventurer. The story for Ittle Dew is simple: Beat things up and solve puzzles. And then you have weirdo, meta characters and conversations that take slight jabs at the game itself. The interactions with Tippsie (the flying fox) and Ittle are my favorite bits in the game, mostly because of how cynical and arrogant Tippsie comes off. If you do like the wierdness humor of Adventure Time or Regular Show, then you'll probably find the other characters entertaining. I had one or two laughs as I liked the small world of the game, but I didn't find anything too interesting or memorable.What Can You Dew?Where the story and the characters were lacking, the puzzle/adventuring aspects of the game were what sold me on the game itself. And not on my first playthrough but my third one as well.You are given a stick to start with that can temporarily be set on fire. You later can get a Flame Scimitar (like the stick but stronger and always on fire), the Portal Wand that can create blocks and teleport things, and a Freeze Wand. Some items have some synnergy between them that becomes useful when solving a room when you only have two items.In order to beat the game, you only require two out of three items; however, on your first playthrough, you will want to collect all three items to 100% the game. Not only would you want to do this for achievements, but after each item-boss, there are extra dungeons that teach you more in-game mechanics through smaller, harder puzzles.The only reward  worth caring about is the heart-notes for extra lives; the cards are added in for flavor, but it's the practice of familiarizing yourself with the mechanics and experimenting with your tools are the real rewards for the challenge. They're all centered on the item you bought and they're all completely optional, so the puzzles are a great method of teaching the player how to play the game better.Once you have all three items, and you think you're smart enough, you can then tackle the Master Cave. You might think these challenges begin fairly simple (for the first four or five rooms), but the later challenges will test your reflexes as much as your puzzle-solving skills, sometimes in really convuluted ways. I'll admit I had to use a guide because some solutions were so specific to the millisecond I wouldn't be able to figure it out on my own. Although the payoff for completing the twelve hardest puzzles of the game is anticlimatic (as well as the boss-fight), this part of the game will teach you skills you were not even aware of you had all the time with a given tool (or combination of the two).A complete playthrough, on a (mostly) blind run, will take you about four to seven in-game hours depending on how stubborn you are to avoid a guide. The real fun of the game comes on your next three playthroughs.A Task Against FamiliarityAs mentioned before, the game is designed for you to complete the game with two out of three items. Backtracking for the items is less tedious as you'll most likely be able to solve the professional shortcuts after the Master Cave. Navigating through the Castle with a limited amount of items is the real challenge.The game forces you to tackle certain rooms for enough loot for what you need while also figuring out how to reach the final boss-room. The final boss fight is tailored to whatever items you have, although the fight is much shorter as a result. Unfortunately, as a result of not having enough items to do everything, your playthrough from 4 to six hours goes down to less than fifteen minutes to three hours at most as a result of handicaping yourself. These shorter runs are still worthwhile because the game takes previous challenges and does a new spin on them, and some rooms are probably impossible (but you wont' know until you try), so these playthroughs are not worthless. I just wish there was some way to still 100% ALL rooms with these limitations. No run will match the first one in length or for completion, and they freel tailored for speedrunners alone. (I'm not a fan of speedrunning my games; I prefer to take my time and relax). ""Eh, 3 out of 5 at best.""This isn't my score of the game, but I think that line quite sums up my thoughts. The game has great potential to expand upon, but the shortcomings on the more interesting playthroughs make me hopeful for more polish from a game that is already nicely polished.			"

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/241320		

ittle dew is a zelda-esk game focusing more on the puzzles.there is 1 main castle, 3 sub areas also a master cave with really hard puzzles and each comes with it's own boss.you start with a stick that you can bash foes with or light it on fire for puzzles, later you can upgrade it to a fire sword.you will mainly be collecting cards, paper heart scraps and looking for the big chests with gold.the gold is taken to the whittlers shop where you can buy 3 items, the fire sword, the block/teleport wand, & the ice wand.it's short sweet and not horrific to play.

												If you like zelda, puzzles, or fun this is the game for you. It's charming, FUN, and really interesting. The beauty of the puzzles is in their simplicity, yet their challenge. It's obvious what you have to do, but actually doing it and thinking out the puzzle itself is awesome.			"

												Ittle dew will do good for its price!It gives you the feeling that you are playing a game that is taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥at the series of The Legend of Zelda.Even though the game is quite shortish, (Main story is at least.) You have quite a bit of puzzles lying around waiting for you to figure them out. Game plays fluently, boss mechanics might have been made a little more difficult, but in the end the game was worth it!I rate this game around 7.5/10 Pros: -Retro feel with cartoon graphics.-Fun puzzles.-Music is great.-World layout.Cons:-Short story.-Boss fights should have been more challenging.

												If you like 2D Zelda games, speedrunning and funny dialogue then get Ittle Dew. Its on here and the Wii U eshop for$9.99. Its hella nice. Yeah go get it. Unless you don't like any of those, then keep moving and ignore this review.Alright, I'll actually talk about the game. So you're an adventurer named Ittle Dew and her sidekick Tippsie are on a raft when they bump into a rock and crash on the shore of an island. After going through a short tutorial cave, there's a big castle you come across filled with weird inhabitants who wear suits and tend to be wacky. Outside the castle is Itan, who runs a shop. You can find treasure chests in the castle with coins and you use those to go towards getting items from the shop. Well, you pay Itan and he launches you to a dungeon that the item is at (a fire sword in a fire cave/volcano, an ice wand in an ice cave/dungeon, and a portal wand in the woods). Each dungeon contains a shortcut that can help you get to the boss faster (most likely than not you're gonna use these if you're speedrunning but they do help you finish the dungeons faster supposing you can figure out the puzzle for each shortcut). Depending on the combination of the items you collect (you need at least 2 to get through the castle to the final boss), you can take different routes through the castle to get to the end.Aside from the items I previously mentioned, there are also collectible cards you can find in chests throughout the game that have a picture of a character or enemy in the game along with info on them (they go towards an achievement) and you can find scraps of paper in chests as well that go towards increasing your heart count (4 pieces make a new heart a la Legend of Zelda heart containers, this is also for an achievement if you find them all).This game will test you and your thinking skills. Sometimes puzzles are simple like press all the switches or kill all the enemies or hit switches. Other times, you might take a while to solve a puzzle only to be stumped by the next one. Two optional bonus dungeons (The Master Cave and, as of October 31, 2013, the Compost Crypt) contain even tougher brain scratchers and while not necessary or important to the plot (I did say optional, after all), you do get an achievement, one per dungeon upon completing them and there's cards in the Master Dungeon so you'd have to complete it if you were gunning for all the cards. Think of them as advanced puzzles, more or less.Lastly, the dialouge is quite humorous. All the characters have a self-aware feel to them when they speak, like they know they're in a video game. There's even call backs/shout outs to older 2D Zelda games like A Link to the Past or Zelda 1. It knows what its doing and you just go with it cause why not. Even the art style is appealing to the eyes.I've probably harped on long enough but maybe this will convince you to at least check out Ittle Dew. Look, if you like the old school 2D Zelda games or know someone that does, then this game might be for you/them. Hopefully I've said more than enough to peak your interest B^)			"

It's a bit short given the price tag, but it looks nice, and the animation is superb. The puzzles are designed very, very well. The items you can get interact in various ways, some of which are not explained or obvious. This creates some puzzles that can be solved much sooner than you think by using advanced tactics.In fact, you can finish the game with any combination of two items, and the items can be gotten in any order once you figure out how to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥			"

												While Ittle Dew does not match the scope of the 2-D Legend of Zelda games in scope and variety, it packs quite the punch for such a small and short game. The game takes many pages out of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening's page book, and adds its own twist to it. The game largely does not focus on combat as much as its inspiration, The Legend of Zelda, but puts most of its focus on puzzle solving. And the puzzles are no push over either. In fact, I would wager that many of them are much more difficult than anything we generally see in a Zelda game. Ittle Dew also has a unique quirky sense of humor sprinkled throughout the game, and because of that and its satisfying gameplay is quite the charm. Many reviewers have complained that the game is too short. And it is short, coming in at about four hours just to beat the game. There is some content you can get before or after the game that may add to that gametime though if you wish. But I found little reason to do that. By the time you get towards the end of the game, Ittle Dew begins to reach its limit. Any continuation or extension of the game in any meaningful way would only drag out a good thing way too long. The only drawback that this game has is it's price, which is currently around $15. For a four hour game, $15 is a bit much and for some may not be worth it. Hopefully, we will see another game featuring Ittle Dew sometime in the near future. If it does though, hopefully it will either be longer, but with quality that this game would have lacked if it ran any longer. Or the game will be cheaper to match the low amount of game time.Ittle Dew in many ways does precisely what its title suggests in that: It'll do. But because of that, it focuses intently on a few aspects of gameplay, namely the puzzles and humor, that go above and beyond its title's suggestions and which ultimately makes it a great gem.			"

												A very endearing, traditional but fresh action adventure.The gameplay is very Zelda with puzzle-heavy top-down rooms and palace-like dungeons for each tool you acquire. The tools are very different from what you'll find in Zelda games, though, and there's a lot of focus on having them interact with each other - one puzzle may have you freeze a block to let it slide across that spike wall and then freeze and teleport a bomb so its detonation syncs with you lighting a brazier.Be aware that it doesn't take long to finish the game, but its replay value is high because the path through the castle is nonlinear, there's a lot of optional treasure/puzzles, and extra-hard shortcuts encourage challenge and speedruns. The limited game length also means that a lot of effort could go into each individual room - nothing feels rushed, and the puzzles use available game mechanics to their fullest potential.Ittle Dew's strongest point of the game is the irreverent yet cute, self-aware humour. Quirky enemy design, expressive hand-drawn graphics and the music support the atmosphere very well.Combat is rather basic and more about approaching strategically or outsmarting enemies than about the actual process of beating them up, but still a nice diversion between puzzles.If you care about silly dialogue, clever puzzles and exploring different routes through the same dungeon, this is for you. If you like long, linear games with a focus on combat and are a dialogue-skipper or prefer serious storylines, you're looking in the wrong place though.			"

												TL;DR: So, I got this game off humble bundle and wasn't particularly excited to play it. I started it up expecting to hate it after a few minutes and then just let it idle for the cards, but boy was I wrong. This game is really good. Probably among the most fun puzzle game I've played. Easy 8/10. So in this game you play as an adventurer. Not much is known about your character aside from the fact that she's totally a girl. I mean, I didn't pay too much attention to the story, but that's basically all I know about it having completed the game.You're off to get 3 magical items to help you solve progressively more complicated puzzles, a fire sword, a portal wand, and a ice wand thing. Different objects on the screen interact differently (or not at all) with each magical item. Conveniently, a local shopkeeper sells them and you're able to purchase them from him. Only, when you do, you're put into a puzzle series cave where you have to show somewhat of a mastery of the item to get out. Some of the puzzles are really solid, making you somewhat frustrated after not getting them within the first 10 tries. Of course, there's also the others that are super obvious and take maybe 1 attempt, 2 if you pressed the wrong button. Good variety and the later stages of the puzzles make you think with portals. Combat is pretty dull in the game. Though, admittedly, I totally died to a pancake out of recklessness more than a few times. Valv pls fix. You press x to do the damage, or you can be fancy and try to teleport mobs into spikes or something. The controls either weren't given out in the game (I had to press every key on my keyboard to figure out how to use the stick to attack for a while), or I totally didn't pay attention to the tutorial. There is a 2 level tutorial. Oh, I forgot to mention, the puzzles vary between push blocks into pressure plates, clear all enemies on the map, light all the things that need lighting, or burn out all the things that shouldn't be on fire. You might think that's pretty lame and hardly fun, but the quickness of the game definitely makes thing way less awful than they would be. Trust me.Aside from combat, which really isn't even a big deal because the game isn't driven to encourage you to fight everything on the map except in a few area where you need to to open a door, the only real upset with the game is how fast you can complete it. Keep in mind, I had intended to just get all the cards in the game and then back out. I was sucked in and before I knew it, I finished the game. I mean, sure, I didn't 100% it, but I cleared the final boss. I didn't expect to because a certain key item given out at the end led me to believe that there would be some other areas to access, but that wasn't the case. In my first blind run, I finished the game in three and a half hours. I mean, sure, that's actually a pretty reasonable time for a game to take in a campaign mode anyway, but I really really wanted more. I guess that's a good thing, though.So after getting here this far, you probably know that I'm going to rate this game pretty highly. I would put Antichamber and Portal above this game in terms of similar games that are more fun, but this game isn't too far behind! Easy eight out of ten. I would only dock points for not doing anything groundbreakingly new (which would push it over the top and is basically a requirement to get a 10. ♥♥♥♥ people who give every game 10s), and being exceptionally short. Though, the latter is likely not an issue because this game can be played on your phone.Oh yesyou heard meyou can play it on your phone. I would encourage anyone with even a mild interest in puzzle games to give this one a shot.			"

I mean, sure, I didn't 100% it, but I cleared the final boss. I didn't expect to because a certain key item given out at the end led me to believe that there would be some other areas to access, but that wasn't the case. In my first blind run, I finished the game in three and a half hours. I mean, sure, that's actually a pretty reasonable time for a game to take in a campaign mode anyway, but I really really wanted more. I guess that's a good thing, though.So after getting here this far, you probably know that I'm going to rate this game pretty highly. I would put Antichamber and Portal above this game in terms of similar games that are more fun, but this game isn't too far behind! Easy eight out of ten. I would only dock points for not doing anything groundbreakingly new (which would push it over the top and is basically a requirement to get a 10. ♥♥♥♥ people who give every game 10s), and being exceptionally short. Though, the latter is likely not an issue because this game can be played on your phone.Oh yesyou heard meyou can play it on your phone. I would encourage anyone with even a mild interest in puzzle games to give this one a shot.			"

												You could buy three games for the price of this one, it's true; but they wont give you this much fun.  This game is worth the price.  While it is ""a short game"" compared to games like ""Zelda"" and such, this game has a fun index that isn't quite matched, by not even Nintendo.  While the humor in this game is crude at times, it is still suitable for kids (even as young as 5, the rating says 10 but I can assure you this game is fine for a 5 year old)... while the difficulty level may make even the best gamers, frustrated at times.  This game is heavy on puzzles... there were a couple that left me scratching my head for a while.			"

												Since I wrote a negative review for Ittle Dew 2, I feel inclined to add a positive review for this game.This game is clever, funny, challenging, endearing, and ... the list could go on and on. It's well worth the cost.It is a puzzle game, so the puzzles and tools to solve them are incredibly important to the games success. The puzzles difficulty progresses pretty well through the game. When I hit a puzzle that took me hours to figure out, when I finally did finish, I usually felt pretty satisfied, as opposed to some puzzle games where you feel cheated (Or that the solution was unfair/obtuse for some reason). It's pretty clear when you can't do a puzzle, so you know to come back to it later. The shortcuts from if you already have other items felt very fair and that they were just a bonus for having already done other dungeons first.The dialog is great. It very often made me laugh, some of those times quite loudly.So yes, I would definitely recommend this game full heartedly.			"

												You can tell that this is a game heavily inspired by the original Legend of Zelda and Link to the Past, but this game definitely has its own charm. Whereas the mandatory dungeons are of ranging difficulty levels and generally are neither too easy nor too difficult, the random caves you can collect cards from offer a higher degree of difficulty which is refreshing. I love that instead of being a silent character, Ittle has humorous insights and conversations with her equivalent to Link's Navi: Tippsie. It's also quite nice to see that the main character is female without it being an important feature or something that is overly emphasized to please a feminist audience, it's just a character that happens to be female who slays monsters and goes on adventures. Cool. Also, Tippsie offers advice when you want it rather than nagging you, which is a small but important detail. The music is great and suits the different environments in the game, and the graphics have a fun cartoon feel to them without making the game feel immature. Love it!			"

												The game took about 3 hours to complete my first run through, but it will get faster with experience, and there are even achievements for completing the game within 15 minutes as well as doing it with 3 combinations of only 2 of the 3 items.The game can be a bit frustrating at times, especially the final boss which was very little puzzle and a boatload of enemies that went on for far too long. The rest of the game on the other hand, was almost made up entirely of puzzles revolving around 3 items. A flaming sword, an ice wand, and a teleportation wand. The items can actually be aquired in any order if you know what you are doing, but it does a decent job of explaining each individually. By the end of the game, you have to use all of these items in conjuction with eachother. You can drop a teleportation block, freeze it, kick it across a spike pit, and then freeze the wall to shoot a teleportation beam that bounces back and hits yourself, sending you to where the frozen block landed. Now that probably sounds really complicated, but the way you are gradually led into single items and then combinations of two or all 3, you really get the hang of it by the end.All of the rooms reset every time you go in except doors that have unlocked, so this cancels any possibility of brining things between the rooms, which makes it easier to work out the puzzles. The levels are very well designed. I felt that it was always introducing new mechanics, concepts, and ways to use the items together. I actually never had a single instance where I got stuck to where I couldn't get out of a certain spot. Although if that were to happen, there is a reset room in the pause menu. There are no consumable items of any kind, not even potions. I feel as if carryable items aside from the sword and two wands would complicate the puzzles and the game, so it is great that they aren't there. The checkpoint system is great in my opinion. If you die, you come back in just as you entered the room, with no penalties of any kind. It's really not an RPG, its more of a sliding block and combat puzzle adventure, it is only really styled after Zelda visually and thematically.I encountered only a single glitch, and it was in the final boss stage. An enemy froze in its dying animation and stayed in place for a minute or so.Overall I think this is a quirky, enjoyable, and decently challenging puzzle game, with tons of references to zelda, and a cute/unique art style. The game felt a little unfinished in a few areas. There didn't seem to be any music at all while the conversation with the final boss was going on, and it just wasn't as fleshed out as it could have been. It's not a must-play title by any means, but it will challenge you and give you a few good laughs. The puzzles can seem daunting or even impossible at times, but I urge you to keep at it. A bit of trial and error, and you'll figure them out. If you aren't willing to take a minute and think about things, you might not have such a great time...			"

												A well designed puzzle game that appeals to a guy that enjoys a challenge but not spending hours in circles without a clue and thus gets annoyed very fast with puzzle games.; you will want to see what you miss when you pick a path and not other. WARNING: getting the true ending will require gimicky solutions that contrast with the fairness of the other puzzles.Do not buy for it's combat system, it is almost a token, and the game is very obviously not designed for it. Making it super easy ( i don't think i ever died of enemy damage) doesn't make it less clunky.Some colorful and very enjoyable graphics and a not too brave but a ok-adjusted story will ease the transitions between puzzles without looking like a fill of time.

												If you grew up in the 80s or early 90s you probably remember the classic exploring adventure games, such as Zelda.    In these games you always played an hero off to find adventure, find treasure and save the world (usually in that order but reverse priority).   To do so, you usually had to solve puzzles and fight plent of bad guys.Enter Ittle Dew, keen on adventure and treasure, but not so much the saving the world stuff, she is finds herself stranded on an Island, with the only chance of leaving involving getting (i.e. stealing) an artifact from a castle for the shopkeeper.Along the way you must get (i.e. once again steal) at least two of three magic weapons with the help of the same shopkeeper (who gladly takes your cash for the favor) to solve the puzzles of the castle and surrounding area.This is a great game that doesn't take itself seriously, but is great for serious players.   You can speed run or play for completion.  There are shortcuts for those willing to do more challanging puzzles, and even alternative ways to solve the puzzles, all while Ittle's sarcastic attitude, her potion-holic assistant ""tippsy"" and a cast of quite insane villians keep you amused. If you expect your games to be serious and realistic, maybe you should look elsewhere, but if you like difficult puzzles and timeless classic-style gameplay, all wrapped up into a tribute to the adventure games of old, then this is definately the game for you.

												A fun little puzzle game with nice artwork.  Don't let the screenshots or heavily inspired Link to the Past aesthetic fool you though, Ittle Dew is about 98% block puzzles and 2% other stuff.  Do not go into this expecting an action-rpg or some kind of dungeon romp with the occasional puzzle.  It's all puzzles and your enjoyment of them will make or break the game for you.There are three items used in puzzles: fire sword, ice wand and portal blocks/teleportation.  This isn't anywhere as limiting as it may seem and the game's puzzle design is very tight and well-done.  Ittle Dew gets a lot of mileage with the different ways it incorporates using the tools together to solve puzzles.  I didn't realize until after I finished it that you can beat the game by only collecting two of the three items and with any combination of the two.   It adds a ton of replay value for future playthroughs.  The game also has ""shortcut paths"", basically hard puzzles that you can use to skip chunks of the game and beat it in less than twenty minutes if you know what to do.  Stuff like beating the game with different combos of items and the shortcut puzzles are cool mechanics/design decisions and I like to seeing them even if I don't necessary plan on ever using them myself.The cartoony art is very nice and vivid.  The UI is simple and efficient.  You don't have to walk out of a room to reset a failed puzzle, you can just hit start and hit reset room to save yourself the needless back and forth you'd find in similar games.  The game lets you know how many items are in each area and most collectible item rooms will let you know if you have the correct item to solve the puzzle so you don't spend time beating your head against the wall trying to solve a puzzle you don't have the right item for.  There's just a lot of little things the game does to make playing it a non-aggravating experience.In short, if you're down with games that heavily involve pushing blocks and solving puzzles, you'll probably have a solid time with Ittle Dew.  Just don't head into it expecting a Zelda-ish game.			"

												Personal Rating: 8 of 10If you liked puzzle game, Ittle Dew is for you. Don't be fooled by the simplistic graphics, the adventure tag or the RPG liked screen shots. Ittle Dew is a game with minimalist and nonsensicle plot with a little exploring with tonnes of puzzle.In this game, you need to explore dungeon and progress by solving puzzles and unlocking doors. Each area may consists of 1 to several puzzles that you need to solve with the aid of certain weapons. They can be more than 1 approach to solving the puzzle. Each room is reset when you leave the area and coming back. Solving the puzzle will then unlock the doors permanently.The puzzles can be challenging especially the optional ones. The mechanics can be simply but the logic can be tricky. If you longed for greater challenge, you can always visit the master dungeon (which is optional), but be warned as you might need to juice the brain a little.The boss fights can be tough as there are no hint on how you should approach or tackle them. My guess is there were meant to be that way so it seems like another puzzle for you to solve along the way. My only beef with the game is the achievement. Personally I think there is no reason to replay them as the puzzles and maps are the same even though there are several ways to tackle them. You might already solve them during your first gameplay but having all three weapons automatically cancels the achievement.			"

												Ittle Dew is a side-splitting little top-down aventure game. This is everything that there is to love about independent game design wrapped in a convenent package, featuring familiar but creative gameplay and a big, non-linear environment to play in. The whole thing feels a little like a parody of Beyond Oasis or Link's Awakening, but even beyond that there's a charming little story going on.If you aren't the kind of person who likes to play a game more than once, this might put you out a little; to get the full experience, the game needs to be completed four different times. Many of the puzzles have several different solutions, and the game is carefully designed to keep the player from ever getting permanently stuck. The sole design flaw is the handling - Ittle can run at angles but can only swing weapons along straight lines, thus fighting is hectic and clunky in some areas.Many of my favorite moments involve Ittle and Tipsie's reactions to their environment; encountering enemies for the first time triggers a short dialogue, nearly all of which are extremely funny. Ittle Dew is worth playing through for it's wholesome comedic over tone alone, and once the appealing gameplay is mixed in, the result is an incredibly fun little romp.			"

												First of all, I really enjoyed playing this game! Think of it as parody on A Link to the Past, but way more focused on puzzles. So if you like puzzles, exploration and RPG-like games, this is for you.Let me get it over with now: I loved the graphics and I also think the music and SFX fit really in the game. Yes, it's simple, but it helps constructing the game's atmosphere.On to pros and cons!Pros:* Game plays nice and puzzles are great and well thought-out* Funny dialogs* Likeable characters* Considerable replayability -- you have basically 3 weapons/tools available. You need two of them, it doesn't matter which. Each pair takes you through a different route. You can also get all 3 if you like. So that's at least four major ways to play the game and I've really enjoyed taking each path.Cons:* A bit short (but you can replay it and it'll still be fun--see above)* Some issues with save files being deleted temporarily (or definitively, as I've read, but it didn't happen to me)* If you're using a controller, it may be weirdly configured and there's no way to reconfigure them. Big picture settings were overriden by the game for me. But I got used to it, no big issue.* If you're using a keyboard, I've read they just forgot to explain which key does which. I've found the clues on the forums, though. But kind of lame.* The weapons are too short and the hit area is very weird. Sometimes you're sure something is gonna hit something (either you, the enemy, projectiles, the first hitting the other one or vice versa), but it doesn't, and the opposite also happens a lot.* The game froze twice while I was playing and I know it happened to a lot of people. It auto-saves on (almost) every room, so you should be fine.* There's an optional boss that's ridicilously out of place. It's annoying to have such an action boss in a game that's so much about puzzles. I can't stress how frustrating it was.Anyway, the game is great! If you're into RPGs focused on puzzles, don't think twice--get it!			"

												An Awesome as ♥♥♥♥ game. Imagine, if you will, a 2d zelda game. Is that was this game is? Yes and no. Zelda games are long quests, this is a short one for speedrunning. Zelda has deep and serious narrative, this is light hearted and funny. Ittle Dew is a fun title, and I would be upset if you said otherwise.			"

												Do you remember old Zelda games with the puzzle rooms, 3 squares, 4 switches, a mirror, etc? Welcome to Ittle Dew game. The puzzles are fun and can be chalenging, the artwork is simply amazing and hilarious, the soundtrack is awesome. The game is relativly short but in a good way. Lots of replayability since you can get to the end with diferent aproaches.You will be pleasantly suprised.			"

												This is Zelda in everything but name. There is slightly more emphasis on puzzle solving to combat, but it's all there.Cute graphics and funny dialogue as well. The levels deserve special mention, they are flawlessly designed, especially when you consider that the layout was specifically crafted to be completable while missing any one of the three key items, which is beyond impressive from a design perspective. It does this without sacrificing difficulty either. Sure, some of the bits are hand-holdy easy, but jesus, I gave up on the master cave ONE PUZZLE IN, and the main castle is also nice and challenging.It's not a brief game. Sure, you could probably blitz through it in 2 hours or so, but its hard to ignore all of the optional chests taunting you on your minimap. For such a colourful game, it also gets surprisingly dark... I'm sure this was planned, but oh man, those ghosts...Huge, positive reccomendation from me, especially if you're a Zelda fan.			"

												Devlopers seem to be unable to fix their own game.In my case I don't even have a gamepad and can't even start the game since it's stuck moving right which right away means I can only change the game lanauge.... On another computer that did have a wired X360 pad their recomended pad it was stuck going left so I could get into the game but it was unplayable. Overall I'd say only buy on a super sale since there is a GOOD chance it just is not going to work on your system and if you read the fourms the devlopers say they don't even have the tools to patch the game anymore, so there's a very low chance this will ever be fixed.

												This game has an endearing hand-drawn art style, and the few characters are ""quirky"", but the three items can't improve the monotony of block-pushing puzzles.Although the items can be used and combined in some interesting ways, the game does not have much depth as far as the variety of puzzles is concerned. Each room will have you either killing all enemies in the room, or pushing blocks to press switches in order to open the next room. This wears thin, and even though each item dungeon has a gimmick revolving around the new item, the premise is the same.Side-content is limited to heart pieces and collectable cards, so there is not too much incentive to pursue these, as taking damage is rare.

Posted: October 14, 2014
												This is an unreasonably good game.  I do list a few nitpicks below, but they don't wreck the game.ProsFirst, the positive: This game is cleverly designed, adorable, and a lot of fun.  I enjoyed playing it, and I hope to see a sequel someday.  The puzzles were very well-presented, giving you opportunities to learn the tools before being thrown into a terrifying challenge.  You're always ready, but the puzzles always stretch you and I, for one, walked away feeling satisfied with my accomplishments.There are only 3 tools, and yet... the ways they're used are magnificent.  You don't have a bag of gimmicky gadgets to fumble through; instead each puzzle uses one, two or three tools in really clever ways, and I often felt brilliant when I completed them.The main game can be defeated when you have all three tools... but you don't need all three.  You can also beat the game with any combination of only two tools, which just warps my mind.  The puzzles felt so tight and so tough, and I was amazed to discover I could complete them with even less.  There's also various side dungeons where you can pick up more health, or collect optional cards.  The real reward is the feeling of victory and the wild ego boost that comes with completing them all by yourself, simply for fun.For a really steep challenge, there's also an optional master dungeon that requires all three tools and some really clever thinking.  I strongly recommend it.The characters and story are adorable and funny.  I liked them.  The animations are excellent, and I loved the look and feel of Ittle's world.  I also liked Ittle herself... she's charming, if devious.  Her little flying helper is also fun.  They do a good job of making fun of their genre, while adding a lot of their own character as well (which is more important than the parody, and done well).Cons:A few minor niggles include:-A bit of unclarity in hitboxes and figuring out whether an attack will hit.  It's not a huge deal, since combat is secondary to the puzzles and even this issue doesn't make the combat unfun at all.-On a couple occasions, the master dungeon pulled some unwarranted tricks, like requiring incredibly fast movement (down to the millisecond) to be in position in time to act or stop a block, which felt like a deviation from the formula that makes the game good (clever puzzle solving, not brutal platforming skill)But the major issue?I was intensely offended by the optional side-boss fight.  Instead of having you employ all the great tricks you've learned just to reach him, he throws ALL of that away... he is instead just a standard run & stab boss battle, and a brutally unfair one at that (I eventually gave up).  Only your sword matters; you will not use the other tools at all (trying will get you killed repeatedly).  The best strategies I've read for beating him were simply to have lots of health and be fast.  It requires incredibly tight controls, which this game doesn't have, so a lot of it is luck and cheesing bugs and quirks in the AI and movement.  This was not a good climax to the otherwise brilliantly designed master dungeon; instead it was a malicious slap in the face, and god it hurt.It still leaves me a bit grumpy, even after all these months.  >:(But does this ruin the game?  NO!  It felt anti-climactic and I did feel betrayed and put upon by the developers, but the rest of the game is so good, that this just fades into background noise in comparison.Summary9/10.  This is a fantastic game.  Yes, I'm still intensely bitter about the optional boss (RAAAAGE!!!!), but that doesn't destroy the pure, unfiltered joy that is the rest of this game.  Everything in the main game and optional dungeons, save for that side boss, is excellent.  I still look back with extreme fondness!  I'm looking forward to playing the free Halloween update soon, which was a really cool thing for them to add.			"

Plus it finally explains how the hearts work in the grizzliest way possible, and we can always use more games with female protagonists. Go buy it.			"

												Take the original Legend of Zelda's level design and add a lot of clever puzzles and a sprinkling of humor and you have ""iTTLE DEW."" No, this is not a Zelda-like RPG. And, no, it does not try to be a Zelda-like RPG. Putting the graphics aside, this is it's own unique game. The puzzles are worth the price of admission alone. They consist of pushing blocks, planting bombs, and and using your unique items to help you progress. Some of these puzzles can be quite challenging. One of the really clever things about this game is that some puzzles can be completed in different ways by using a different combination of your items. It makes for a lot of ""ah ha"" moments. There is also a real satisfaction in walking into a room that may seem utterly impossible only to discover the solution after reasoning things out. There are enemies to fight, akin to Zelda, but they serve more to enhance the puzzle mechanic rather than offer an action spin. With that said, it does mix things up in the puzzle department and there are collectables that can be picked up for your efforts. The only gripe i have with the game is that it is painfully short. It can be completed in a matter of minutes for more intelligent gamers out there; there is even an achievement for it. The average gamer will be able to experience most of what the game has to offer in two to three hours. The game does offer extras in terms of collectables that can be sought for completionists and a end game dungeon to really challenge your puzzle solving acumen. This can extend the game time some but over all it does leave you wanting more.			"

												It's a good game, but from what I saw I thought I was getting a zelda clone or arpg and it's nothing like that, this is entirely a puzzle game. As a puzzle game it's surprisingly challenging and the different mechanics work well together and lend to some interesting stages. The design of the puzzles actually reminds me a lot of Portal in how they're constructed and the lateral thinking that you have to apply sometimes (and not just because there's a portal wand in the game). However the game is pretty short, I was able to get the achievement for beating it in 3 hours on my first playthrough and I thought I was taking it slow. There's replay value in that puzzles that are easy with say the portal wand are much much harder when you try to brute force it using just the ice wand, and doing the Wanderer achievement was very difficult and at times I had to use a walkthrough which is something I never do. The collectables are entirely pointless (they even say so in the game), the bosses and combat in general is frustrating and not fun at all, and the entire game can feel shallow but there's fun to be had. I got it for nearly nothing on the humble bundle and I wouldn't recommend paying much more than $5 for it based on its length but if you like puzzle games you'll probably have a lot of fun with it. I just wish they focused more on the puzzles and took out the combat parts of it entirely, since they serve no purpose and will end up♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off more than anything.EDIT: I forgot one of the most important aspects for me which is linux support (if you're running on Windows you can just skip over this). This game does support linux and plays great on it compared to other ports on steam, with fully working achievements unlike say Postal 2 (which still bothers me to this day). HOWEVER the controller support is wonky. The first time I ever started the game I calibrated my controller, and everything worked perfectly. I close the game, restart it, and the controls for the analog stick are completely broken, the character will walk when I dont press anything, will go in the opposite direction of what I tell it to, and generally it's unplayable with the stick now even though it worked perfectly the first time, and recalibration did nothing to fix it. Thankfully I was able to map movement to the dpad instead which was fine, but since I'm using a ps3 controller and the dualshock 3's dpad is garbage it was pretty annoying to control like that, though everything else worked perfectly.

												Good little 2d zelda clone. The attacking range and lack of enemy stun/bounceback when you hit them can be a litte annoying at a time. But clearly a lot of love went into this. Good little 3 hour zelda-lite game. I would imagine it goes up to around 5 hours if you complete everything 100%. There were a couple of bonus dungeons I didn't do. A nice idea for the dev would be to release tools to make your own  Zelda (ittle dew) as dlc using all the enemies and sprites and mapping tools you used for this. The game has a great art style and people would love to build there own dungeons and make there own adventures. I think people would really go for that.			"

												Just can't recommand this game, level design is too amateurish for example in the master cave you have to do a game mechanics that it was NEVER used before so you dont even know its possible to do, also the last boss of that cave is very poorly made the only way to defeat him is by having all heart piece and just tank him, someone even said have used a cheat engine to slow the game and even pixel perfect it was not possible to defeat him without getting hurt because the sword animation is too slow =/also most of the puzzle is alway the same thing is just push the block on a switch and teleport/freeze it not much variety like in a Zelda gamebut i gotta give credits to the artist who made the visual of that game it is fantastic and the animation is well made! but like we say good graphics don't make a good game Gameplay > all6/10 "

												Ittle dew is a legend of Zelda based game with funny jokes and lovley art style, though the game is really short and takes about 1 hour to finish, unless you're doing the achivements in which case you could spend around 10 hours. For 7 euro I don't reccomend anyone to pick this up unless they like repeating theese kind of games for avchivements. The puzzles are quite simple and there's nothing spectacular about this game.My opinon---I overall liked this game..but I got so dissapointed of it being so short that I whould only give this game 4/10			"

												Frankly what sealed the neg on this game for me was the final boss. The puzzles throughout were time consuming and frustrating to the average gamer, but at least tolerable. The lacking responsiveness of the controls was frustrating at times. (360 Gamepad, Win10, updated drivers for all (I work in IT)). The hero was at times sluggish and underpowered. The surprise ""bullet hell"" rooms were especially irritating. If I wanted to play a bullet hell game, I would have bought one. I was willing to give a neutral rating for all of the above reasons until the final boss. The final boss reminded me step-by-step of why exactly I HATED this game.* RNG-Based Combat* Inability to see boss half the time on bomb phases.* Spam of annoying enemies and too many blocks* Bullet Hell AGAIN on top of everything else.* No boss health indicatorPeople swear by this game, and I can only imagine that they are masochists because I had nothing but an aggravating disgrace of an experience playing this.

The game's not called Zelda though. Anyway, Zelda lands on an island. I think its Germany because the enemies turn into confetti and candy when you kill them. Anyway, his fairy has become a flying dog that drinks all his red potions. Zelda also has boobs now (they're very small. Shh!) and I think he came to the island to find his hat because its missing.This is the weirdest Zelda yet because Zelda never finds any rupees and all the enemies are From Where the Wild Things Are and they all have the same name.I am now going to spoil the entire game for you...The enemies are all named Jenny Rich because its a play on the word generic.good Zelda game would buy again.

Ittle Dew is a game which made me realize that the Zelda-like genre of games is inherently awful and that people who like them probably only like them out of nostalgia. It claims to ""boil down the classic adventure formula until there is only fun left"" but I've realized no amount of boiling will get rid of the BS that goes straight to the very bones of this game and games in similar veins. I understand that there is a level of subjectivity involved, that maybe this genre is just not ""for me,"" but this is my review based on my experience of the game, most of which is negative. Mechanically, nearly everything about this game is bad. It does not modernize or simplify (""boil down"" to use the devs' words) any of the frustrations of old school Zelda, it literally rips the most infuriating aspects of those games out and reskins them. It manages to even add some of its own terrible ideas to the pile of garbage. I don't usually do this but I listed them down.1) Your weapon attack has no arc at all. You literally cannot damage something that is right next to you but diagonal despite  the sword having a visual arc and enemies being able to knock into you and kill you like every game. This isn't Final Fantasy Tactics, I don't understand what the problem is.2) The hearts mechanic. It's so pointless to make your HP into collectibles, I don't understand why you would even bother when there's nothing to gain from killing enemies that aren't linked to puzzles. You're more likely to lose hearts than gain them given how your attacks are bound to the four cardinal directions whilst enemies fill the rooms and spam them with projectiles and fast moving bodies. Then when you die, you just gain back all your hearts anyway. And this is a game that encourages speed running. It literally does this just to emulate Zelda, there's absolutely no mechanical reason for the game to have this archaic system.3) Respawning enemies. Again, just run past everything because even if you kill anything it only serves as a removal of a distraction anyway.4) Respawning enemies in puzzle rooms.  5) Undefeatable instant kill enemies. Yup, they stole Wallmasters. The most garbage enemy in all of the Zelda franchise and you decided to emulate that.6) UNDEFEATABLE INSTANT KILL ENEMIES IN PUZZLE ROOMS. Just go to hell and stay there, please.7) Puzzle bosses that have to be hit more than once. It's a puzzle right? The same puzzle three times over doesn't make it more difficult, it just makes it tedious.8) Dexterity tests. This is where I finally drew the line. I was having trouble with a puzzle in the Master Cave and finally gave in and looked up the solution and as it turned out the solution involved pushing a dozen buttons in the correct order in a very small window of time, which the game asks you for nowhere else. Someone asked about the same puzzle on the front page of the forums at the time of this review, and the devs literally reply ""Sorry not sorry."" Are you kidding me.I'll give them props on two fronts: they don't make any of the collectibles missable despite having branching dungeon designs, and the worst parts of the game are optional. In fact, a lot of the game seems to be optional. Kind of makes me think they were aware that people would want to skip playing most of it.I'm being mean. This is probably a really good game for the genre, definitely compared to most of Steam. I also genuinely love the art style. But as I said at the start, I realized that this genre as a whole is just bad, the aspects of it that are considered its trademarks add nothing but artificial difficulties to a game which doesn't have a strong core of anything. If it's about the puzzles, why have all the enemies distracting you from them? If it's about beating things up or performing pro gamer moves, why are the mechanics all so wanky? It can't be about story, there's no story barring some snarky jabs at its predecessors.Games of this breed of ""action-adventure"", a kind of mix and match of everything, belong to another time period. Having a modern version just highlights how badly the ideas have aged with time and how the genre doesn't hold up without quality of living adjustments that other games have evolved over time. So the thing that I gained the most out of playing this game is an acute awareness that I don't actually like games like this.			"

												To anyone who would wear a “Pop Culture Reference” t-shirt, this is fine. To anyone else, this is a rather shallow copycat/parody; an amateur twaddle that is trying so hard to be “like the old-time mastepiece” but does not stand up to the challenge; it is trying to make self-referential remarks on the sillyness of the atmosphere, but it just says “look I can be meta haha”. No replay value, not a breakthrough in any area — just an overhyped arcade to kill a couple of hours. It is pretty, but nothing more.—I really hate to be this harsh, but look, I am lampshading it too, haha, just like the game, so do not downvote me, right?			"

												Ittle Dew is a cute little jaunt through a 2D-Zelda-inspired tropical island. An initial playthrough will probably run somewhere betwen 2-5 hours (it was a hair over 3 for me but I didn't go for 100%), but the game encourages replays with achievements and a whole heap of charm. There are only three items to get in the game, but there's always the possibility of going back and trying to beat it with only two items and once you've gotten that figured out, it's time to go for the low-time achievement. The game seems simple on the surface, and maybe it is, but fans of classic Zelda games and/or good puzzle design will enjoy it. Short, but fun enough to be worth $10 even if you only play it once. If you ever see it on sale, though, don't hesitate to grab this.			"

												Ittle Dew took the retro zelda/alundra puzzle adventure formula and added in a mix of witty parody alchemy and makes it its own. One of its main strengths would be the simple yet captivating artwork, the challenging and entertaining puzzles, the interesting array of items as well as its jokes that seemingly becomes better and better as the game progresses.  It is not the best in the genre, but certainly worth mentioning and worth the $ value for any gamers. For a retro puzzle adventure gamer, this little gem is a must have. 7.5/10			"

												A fun little game with pleasant cartoony graphics. It has a strong focus on puzzles which you solve by pushing blocks onto switches and killing enemies. The game in general is somewhat reminiscent of Zelda. The puzzles are challenging but not enough to be frustrating. The game is pretty short and took me about 3 hours to finish, including a tiny bit of sidetracking. It took around an extra 2 to actually complete every puzzle/area. I do have some problems with the game however, the boss fights felt out of place and I didn't enjoy them. I was also frustrated with the controls, the game uses the arrow keys as well as A,S,Z,X which in my opinion was an extremely awkward choice of keys, I frequently confused each of the keys despite playing the game for hours. FInally, while I enjoyed the solving the puzzles required to beat the main game, I found some of the outside puzzles very annoying to solve, there are a lot of things that the game doesn't explain to you, like the fact that you can bounce portals and ice off of frozen walls, things like this end up being part of how you are meant to solve the puzzles so if you don't know about these things these kind of puzzles can be very difficult to complete. Overall, I enjoyed the game and the main story has just the right difficulty level for people who people who are decent at puzzle games. The puzzles outside the main story like those in the Master Cave or Compost Crypt seem to be more for seasoned puzzle solvers.  It's a nice game but I feel that for its short length, it'd be more accurately priced at $5.			"

The only knock I would give it is that the amount of content is limited; as of this review, I beat the game in a little over 2 hours, and I imagine there are a few more hours worth of content in order to get a 100% completion.

												Trust me, Ittle Definitely DewAs you may be able to tell from the pictures, or from others, it is a adventure puzzle game. Most compare it to The Legend of Zelda (its even in the tags). But don't let that dissuade you from playing; it is anything but a cheap ripoff. This game puts you in place of a female adventurer named Ittle Dew, with her potion-aholic companion appropriately named Tippsie, as you crash land on an island. Your main goal is, of course, to find what secrets the island may hold. The game is humorous and cute in its old fashion, often giving you little quips of dialogue here and there. One unique thing about the game is the way it handles it puzzles; there are several ways to solve them with your different tools. As you progress through the game, you unlock more tools to help you solve previous puzzles. But you don't need all the tools to solve all the puzzles. If you're up for the challenge, that is.The game is quircky and fun. A fair length given its price. If you enjoy puzzle games, you'll enjoy this one. Fans of the Zelda series will fall right in.			"

												//bottom line:a decent little zelda-like with a strong emphasis on the puzzles; and a nice goofy humor to it.nothing spectacular, but worth the money.//details:game is a send off of zelda, with a goofy, kid-appropriate humor, and a strong emphasis on puzzle sovling. it is somewhat non-linear, and often gives you several possible paths to choose from, so if you get stuck on one puzzle/room you can generally try another instead, which greatly helps with the frustration level.main problem I have is with the controls, I have owned this game for a while but never played it due to a bug where the left direction was jammed (avatar kept wanting to go left...). once I tried again with a patched version, I found the keys were not rebindable, and there was no tutorial on how to use them. The controls are pretty simple but, but still, give some basic explantion or better yet, let me customize them to what I prefer.regarding length: I am ~3 hour in as of this review; and am in the process of earning the last of 3 powerups in the game.based on that and how much of the map I have covered, I am guessing I am around 50+ % of the way thru the main gamethis may be a bit short for some folks, but I personally find it comparble to other puzzle/action games such as VVVVVV, portal      1/2, and escape goat 1/2. it is not the best value, but definatly reasonable for this type of game.it also has a lot of optional/bonus content; including in-game cards for all the NPCs, and a 'master's cave' with more challenging puzzles. so probably extend my estimate by at least another 3 hours or so.

												Ittle Dew is an action-adventure game heavily inspired by the Zelda games with heavy emphasis on replayability and speed-running. Mechanically, Ittle Dew works just about as well as you'd expect. You can walk around, hit enemies, but the real fun comes from the various puzzles. Like a Zelda game, Ittle Dew has an assortment of items that you'll utilize to solve puzzles. However, unlike a Zelda game, where you'll usually find yourself with 7-8 unique items, Ittle Dew only has. This isn't a major issue, for two reasons. Ittle Dew is a shorter game than Zelda games, and two the way that item's works together creates a large amount of replayabilty, due the game's design allowing for puzzles to be solved in multiple different ways. Ittle Dew's three items are a fire sword, which should be fairly self-explanatory, you hit things and light them on fire, a Portal Wand, which allows you to create blocks and teleport objects around and a Ice Wand which allows you to freeze objects. A large portion of the games puzzles are solvable in multiple different ways using any number of the game's items. Even beating the game only requires 2/3 of the items, this encourages exploration in the game world and experimentation with the game's mechanics as you figure out how to get to the end with a limited toolset, and I found doing so to be very compelling. There is also a fair amount of optional content, from hidden collectibles that require optional puzzles to be found, to a couple of optional dungeons. Competetive players will also enjoy trying to figure out optimal routes through the game in order to beat the game quickly.While I can prise Ittle Dew puzzle solving mechanics and overall design, it's not a perfect game. There's some combat throughout Ittle Dew, and frankly it's not very fun. More often than not, I found that having to kill the enemies in a room detracted from the fun puzzles that I should be solving in the room. There's also bosses, but they're mostly one-trick ponies. You'll figure out how to defeat them quite quickly, and they rarely pose a threat. The combat is a minor part of the game, but I can't help but think it could of been more deeply intergrated into the best parts of the game, the puzzle solving.			"

												To address the elephant in the room: yes, this is very much like the classic Legend of Zelda games.  However, I would have to disagree with some other reviewers that this game is a rip-off of the Zelda series.Surprisingly, I found quite a few of the puzzles to be more challenging than I've found in Zelda games (and yes, I remember the water temple in OoT.)  The developers did an excellent job of creating some difficult puzzles which take all of the available tools to solve (especially in the optional Master Cave.)  The interaction between the freezing rod and the portal rod was especially ingenious.  Plus, the game itself is quite tongue-in-cheek, which keeps it pretty lighthearted.  I was pleased to see the random commentary when walking up to some random objects throughout the game.I thoroughly enjoy games that make me think, and this game definitely accomplished that.  Additionally, I found Ittle Dew to have decent replay value due to the added challenge of trying to complete the game with varying combinations of the tools (rather than all of them.)In the end, if you enjoy puzzle-heavy games in the same vein as classic Legend of Zelda (and have a sense of humor), then Ittle Dew is worth the purchase.

												If you like The Legend of Zelda then you will like this, as it's basically one big homage to the 2D Zelda games. It might be shorter than your usual Zelda game, but in return it gives a lot of brilliantly designed puzzles that genuinely makes you use your brain without relying on crazy-point-and-click logic. The combat isn't as good as in Zelda though, but it's decent enough to not be annoying, and the puzzles is the main meat of this game anyways. The artstyle and characters are also very enjoyable, mixing the best elements of Wind Waker with A Link To The Past vizually and having a colorful gallery of amusing enemies to fight, with a lot of fun references to the Zelda series scattered around for good measure. The music is also good, but not as memorable or brilliant as in the game it's based on, but it's cool still.All in all, if you don't mind the game being a bit on the short side it's a great buy for any Zelda and/or puzzle fan.

												Ittle Dew is a cute little jaunt through a 2D-Zelda-inspired tropical island. An initial playthrough will probably run somewhere betwen 2-5 hours (it was a hair over 3 for me but I didn't go for 100%), but the game encourages replays with achievements and a whole heap of charm. There are only three items to get in the game, but there's always the possibility of going back and trying to beat it with only two items and once you've gotten that figured out, it's time to go for the low-time achievement. The game seems simple on the surface, and maybe it is, but fans of classic Zelda games and/or good puzzle design will enjoy it. Short, but fun enough to be worth $10 even if you only play it once. If you ever see it on sale, though, don't hesitate to grab this.			"

												I got this game because the trailers reminded me quite a bit of Zelda 3.  That impression proved to be largely inaccurate.  They share some superficial similarity... a tope-down perspective, a sandy haired protatgonist clad in green, some hack and slash gameplay, bombs, wands, and puzzle solving...  But Ittle Dew is much more oriented toward the puzzle solving.  The controls are quite firm-feeling, and are not well-suited to extensive swordplay, but the level design doesn't push a lot of hack'n'slash action.  Most rooms have puzzles to be solved, and the game is mostly non-linear.  In fact, it offers built in challenge modes by purchasingonly 2 of the 3 items offered for the completion of the game's puzzles, with semi-secret alternate routes to accommodate those that choose the handicap.  It also has some extra challenge rooms at the end of the game, after all the items are unlocked.  Some of these border on unfair by featuring puzzles that exploit mechanics that were never seen in the main game in ways that aren't intuitively very clear.  The main quest, by comparison, is almost too straight forward and kid-friendly in its puzzle design.  Approach it with tempered expectations and it's fun game on its own, worth spending a few hours on.			"

												Ittle Dew is a game of adventure and independent puzzle.You control Ittle Dew, a young girl without shoes, who end up on an island full of monsters. Tippsie, her loyal sidekick, will give her some hints during the adventure. The only human being of the island, who is also to the manager of the local store, proposes her an exchange: a raft to leave the island, in exchange for an artefact hidden in the castle of the island.A real adventure for the young Ittle Dew starts: resolution of riddles to move forward in the rooms of the castle; harvest of weapons and objects which will help her in the task; fight against monsters and boss until reach her goal.The whole is made in a funny style, both in drawing and in dialogues. Monsters are completely stupid, and there is a lot of jokes about RPG: the hero who eats literally hearts to regenerate HP, the HP bar made of hearts drawn on papers and maintained between them with adhesive tape, jokes about useless items or achievements... We also collect cards of the bestiary of the game, which describe every character and their tastes in a parodic way. So we learn that some monsters like french fries, that other one is dizzy while it is a flying monster, etc...The graphic style is original, with a real identity, childish and very colored style. Sounds and music are also very nice. On the other hand, it is a short game, between 3 and 4 hours to fully finish it, that is to say by ending the game, the secondary donjons and by collecting all the objects. Everything depends on your speed to understand and to solve the riddles. However, speedrunners and achievement hunters will be satisfied. Indeed, to get all the achievements, you will need to finish the game several times, and one in particular in less than 15 minutes!			"

												This game is amazing. Cute little sokoban-esque puzzles, the most adorable artwork in any of my games, and that kind of ""slightly adult humor"" that I love. The humor makes me think of Shrek 2, full of naughty jokes that only the adults understood, and the kids missed completely. What's with the flying dog thing? Is he really drunk all the time? I don't even know, it's great! Buy this game.			"

												This was a great puzzle game.Really forced you to think through on what attacks you want to use for combat and solving puzzles.The Text is worth reading through out the game, the dialogue is worth reading through out the adventure, but so are the trading cards.Worth while puzzle game for any one interested in Puzzles.*Be warned this game does use special key mapping that you can customize before you start playing the game.

												A really good, cute and well designed puzzle adventure game. Cute graphics, nice humour, smartly crafted puzzles. Main game can be completed in several ways: of the 3 tools you can get in the game, it's enough you obtain 2, but depending which ones you have, they will allow you taking different paths through the castle and a different way to reach your goal. You can also collect all 3 and take a shot at the Master Cave that will put your puzzling skills to a real test.			"

												great game!! very legend of zelda, and they make fun of legend of zelda a lot. the puzzles are harder than zelda, imo. my only sort of complaint would be that the final boss is just really annoying?? i'm really disenchanted with games that are more annoying and time-consuming than hard. but everything else is great! hope the developers release something else soon!

												While yes i enjoyed playing this game i found that the lack of a simple save button was annoying, and sometimes my save file was deleted for some reason, i didn't really know why, which is less then helpful. It was fun at some points and very zelda esque which is a really nice touch with the pieces of heart and the treasure after a boss, though i still found that my save file being deleted was way too big of a set-back so i can't really recommend it, though if you happen to pick it up you will atleast enjoy it.

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I have somehow not written a review for Ittle Dew yet.To call Ittle Dew a Zeldalike is to do it a disservice. While the inspiration is clear, Ittle Dew focuses almost completely on the puzzle aspects, and completely outdoes Zelda in this regard. In the game, there are only three items. One item burns things, one item freezes things, and one item moves things. All of these items interact with each other, and create interesting puzzles as a result. The game is beatable with all three items, or with any two. The items can be acquired in any order. This actually dramatically changes the way you'll progress through the game, as well as the puzzles you will encounter. There is also a sort of modular difficulty, in that many puzzles are solvable with only one or two of the items, but are difficult. If you come back more fully equipped, it usually makes the puzzles much easier.That's all I have to say mechanically, which I think is the primary draw of the game. However, it also oozes charm. It uses a Home Movies-esque Squigglevision style animation which lets you immediately understand what is interactable on the screen. It has a lot of cute dialogue. The characters are one-note, but they do what they need to, and have some pretty funny jokes involved with them.I think this is easily in my top 10 games. Everyone who has an appreciation for tight design should play it.			"

												A part of me really doesn't want to recommend it, but that's just the rage talking.A short, sweet, puzzle adventure game with great art direction and humor. The main storyline puzzles are fairly simple to figure out, while the side-mission 'trading card' puzzles will probably require you actually sit there and think a bit. Then there's the Master Cave that will likely require most people to devote a rather hefty amount of time to get through those 12 puzzles, as they tend to push the limitations of your items as far as possible. But where the puzzles shine, the combat falls completely flat. Your attacks lack any sort of knock back so unless you are backpedaling they will simply walk over you, which is exacerbated by the fact that your sword lacks any reach or arc to its swing, meaning that you will likely be trading hearts with your foes until you perfect the distance. But this isn't a huge flaw as enemies aren't a huge threat and even boss fights are usually more based around item gimmicks than fighting. Usually...The one, ONE, huge glaring flaw in the game is that the Master Cave I mentioned before, the optional end game with the 12 most difficult, mindbreaking, walkthrough inducing, puzzles in the game... ends in a boss that is nothing more than a button mashing lesson in rage and futility. Your items do nothing. The skills and techniques you've worked on through 4+ hours of gameplay are useless. You are stuck using only the shoddy sword combat mechanics, and praying to every deity under the sun that it will bug out and stop attacking so you can kill it sometime this millenia. A massive black spot on an otherwise great puzzle game. I solved every puzzle, collected every card, but due to stupidly dodgy combat mechanics, a lack of luck, and a lack of perfect precision manual dexterity on my part, I couldn't beat it after a full hour of trying. I've no desire to ever try again, and likely will never play this game again because of that stupid boss. Why devs why... why would you do that...Combat boss in a puzzle game = not a happy Vekai			"

												I was very torn about whether or not to recommend Ittle Dew; on one hand, it’s a delightful game with beautiful graphics and a gameplay reminiscent of old-style Zelda. But on the other hand, it doesn’t feel like complete, cohesive game. I really did enjoy playing the game, which is why I ultimately decided to recommend it. But while the premise for the game is solid and built on nostalgia, I never felt like I was playing anything more than a very long demo. I hope Ludosity recognizes they have a great concept on their hands and create a full-length sequel in the future. Create a larger overworld with a deeper story and a better variety of enemies/weapons, and Ittle Dew will be a name worth remembering.			"

												I am glad that they have a female protagonist. Also glad the person is considered a red head although on screen it looks more blonde. Some of the quests/challenges seem a little impossible and some are outrageous to complete. Kinda confusing if you try to play it with a keyboard but an xbox controller may be a little better? The items are set in the same format although is different when compared to the keyboard. All in all a great game to enjoy.			"

												I really liked this game. The puzzels start off really easy but they are nearly impossible at the end (for me). You start off with just a stick and get more weapons/magick as for progres. A few times you lose all your stuff just to get you to use the new weapon/magick. This might seem annoying but you get it back soon enough. I like the fact that the world is pretty much open. Once you encounter a puzzle you can't figur out, you just continue somewhere else. Then you get a new item and suddenly the puzzle makes sense. The little jokes in between are funny, and the storyline is ok. The only negative about this game are the little graphical and audio problems. In the little rooms where the crazy old man was tied up, the foor was just black. I think the texture tiles were missing. And some tiles didn't fit perfectly, leaving a small green line at the side. And I didn't have any sound. I played this on Linux, so I might miss some dependencies. Overall is this a great game to relax, puzzle, smash and admire the art assets.			"

It may look and feel like The Legend of Zelda, but this is not your average Hyrulean adventure. What sets Ittle Dew apart from Nintendo's classic franchise are a willingness to make fun of itself and extremely streamlined gameplay. It's so streamlined, in fact, that you can easily beat the game in only a handful of hours. There is a deck of character cards scattered throughout the world that could potentially extend your play time, but they aren't very rewarding to collect. Plus if you wait until you are fully equipped, many of these optional puzzles are easier than they were intended to be. Speaking of equipment, Ittle Dew's arsenal would leave Link green with envy. The portal wand especially introduces some very unique puzzles that elevate the game above standard-fare LoZ block pushing and flip switching. There's still plenty of that, but the game is always aware of its source material and freely pokes fun of it. The first time I picked a heart up off the ground, I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. From the irreverent sense of humor to the squiggly hand drawn graphics, Ittle Dew is a charming game that holds its own against its apparent competitor.			"

												This odd little indie game is both deceptively short and deceptively long. While the game itself can be beaten very quickly (there's an achievement for managing it in under 15 minutes), there are several routes you can take, of varying length. In short, this is a top-down game (similar to the oldschool Zelda games in terms of control), with a heavy emphasis on humor and parody, and there are different ways around puzzles depending on which items you buy. There are three items, and you can beat the game with any two of them. This is a game meant to be replayed several times, and each time should put a new twist on the same puzzles. Recommended for puzzle fans, or someone looking for a good change of pace for a little while.			"

												What can be said about Ittle Dew? It apes games like the Legend of Zelda, all the while parodying them. Everything from dungeon puzzles to old men in caves are used in the comic arsenal. The majority of the time the humour is spot on but occasionally a joke fails to land.The gameplay is pretty solid for the most part, while in combat it can feel a little slow to respond, but thankfully combat is generally used as a way to solve a puzzle. Most of the puzzles are pretty simple, with exception of the ""expert route's"" you find scattered (these are shortcuts but with puzzles that are much much more difficult.My main issue with the game is it's length, in that it's completely feasible to complete the game in just under half a day.I would recommend this game if it's on sale for £4 or less, it's just too short to pay more.

												At a glance you see the delightful look and loving reference to The Legend of Zelda, but dig a little deeper and you find it's something quite special on it's own. Just completing the game is fairly short, but how you go about it is a puzzle that can be solved many times with abstract solutions. The expert side puzzles are extremely satisfying if you play a lot of LoZ but find them painfully easy. I reccomend this game for fans of Puzzles, Legend of Zelda, and cute girls.			"

												Traditional Zelda is a style of gameplay that is near and dear to many people. The top down adventure makes for some creative puzzle situations and hugely detailed maps. After many years of tinkering with the formula, Nintendo is finally returning to their heritage with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds.What are gamers to do in the meantime, though? If one is not a fan of the 3D games or the DS titles, what kind of game will fill the void? Enter Ittle Dew, a top down adventure game from indie dev Ludosity. What the game lacks in innovative puzzle and world design, it more than makes up for with charm and game feel.The plotline for Ittle Dew is incredibly simple. Your character washes up on the shore of an island and wants to get off. The caretaker of a shop will build you a raft as long as you go through some dungeons he has set up. You also need to pay him for the items he sells, so there is a main hub dungeon that will let you accrue some cash.This is probably the weakest element of the game. While the original Zelda game did not really possess a story of any kind, forgoing a narrative in today’s age is a curious decision. One can personally believe that gameplay speaks above all else, but without a strong desire to continue, some gamers may not even be bother to check Ittle Dew out.Thankfully, the puzzle designs in Ittle Dew are fairly strong. Stripping down the Zelda formula to its basics, Ittle Dew gives players very limited commands to deal with. Controls are essentially walking with the joystick, the four face buttons used for specific items and two shoulders buttons for a map and hint screen.The hint screen is very nicely done, too. Instead of spelling out solutions or talking in cryptic riddles, the game uses the humorous character of Tippsie to lightly insult the player while giving some key hints. Things like, “You’ll only need your fire sword for this room,” are better tests of skill than detailing exactly where to swing your item.The specific items collected are a teleport rod, a fire sword and an ice rod. In an interesting twist, there is no proper order of progression in the game. The best aspect of is how non-linear the design is. Upon completing the journey, I was under the belief that any player would have to acquire all three of the weapons to finish their quest. That actually isn’t the case. Some of the dungeons even have shortcuts direct to the boss rooms.Along with shortcuts and paths for skipping items, the game also has hidden dungeons for collecting extra health and cards. The cards don’t really offer any purpose to the game, but their rooms have some insidiously obtuse puzzle designs. I was stumped in one room for a solid 20 minutes before stumbling upon the answer.When you are transported to any dungeon for a specific item, you only need your wits to get through. No puzzles require another objects or skills you do not possess. This alleviates a lot of frustration from the proceedings.There really isn’t much in the way of challenge, however. If you die, the game simply restarts you in the exact same room with full health. Other than how the sword’s arc doesn’t fully surround your character, the only time one will get annoyed is when they cannot solve a puzzle quickly.A good mention must go to the writing behind Ittle Dew. Everything is very self-referential and parody laden. Genre tropes like collecting hearts and destroying pots all make some kind of appearance. Even the nonsensical nature of enemy placement gets mentioned for being so pointless.Your main character revels in eating hearts and even wishes to just smack things around. The bosses utter some ridiculously incomprehensible catch phrases and then admit to not even knowing what they were talking about. One cannot help but crack a smile while playing.Even the ending is funny. While a rather obvious plot twist occurs, when the final battle comes to a close, the game pokes fun at how most final bosses just kind of give up or don’t take a more obvious approach.Sadly, while Ittle Dew might be great at questioning why adventure games follow specific mechanics, the game really does nothing to spice them up. One shouldn’t be displeased with a fairly high quality Zelda-like game, but a lack of innovation really does hurt the final product.There are some texture designs on the world map that are misleading, as well. For the most part, you cannot walk behind any of the trees in the game. Some of the hidden dungeons are behind them, though. Enemies also disappear behind the trees and are completely invisible to the player.For that matter, the world map doesn’t really serve any purpose other than to move you from point A to point B. Hiding extraneous items behind puzzles is a great incentive for replay value, but giving players some other reason to explore would go a long way to creating a believable world.There is a bonus dungeon hidden in the fields. This acts as the penultimate test of your skills, requiring every item in the game to fully complete. There are 12 rooms and each one gets progressively more challenging in skill. This serves as a nice little bonus to an otherwise very short game.To sum everything up, while Ittle Dew might not be the second coming of adventure gaming or a masterpiece of epic proportions, the game provides plenty of wit and humor along with some decently mind bending puzzles. The game also controls nicely.For $14, one could do much worse. Ludosity certainly does not get points for creativity, but their craftsmanship is noble. This game may not be Zelda, but Ittle Dew. (7/10)			"

												Ittle Dew is a puzzle adventure game that tries to be fit for everyone. While it may draw some reference from Zelda, this game is heavily focused on the puzzle-part instead of the adventure part. Gameplay is rather mediocre, just the usual puzzle-solving by using the assigned tools. Yet it shows good design by giving you many type of play. You can complete the game with incomplete set of tools. Speedrunning achievement is also fun. The main dungeons are fairly easy, but there are hard-as-eff dungeons if you want more challenge. The story is completely ignorable, but you might get mild entertainment from its quirky and 4th-wall-breaking dialogues.In conclusion it is an OK game for a puzzle genre. Buy it on sale if you're hungry for puzzle game, otherwise play your other puzzle game while waiting for sale.			"

This game has a good sense of humor, a catchy soundtrack, and while it can be frustrating at times due to some puzzles (mostly optional ones in the bonus areas) you usually feel a great sense of accomplishment with each room cleared and each secret found.In short: I HIGHLY reccomend this game.

												Game itself is very well put together for how basic it is. This game is ideal to those who enjoy solving puzzles that allow you to obtain items that unlock hidden areas that you may have not been able to in some of the previous ventured zones.cons: controls aren't placed in the most ideal spot, you have to use a,z,s,x in cordinated segments a lot at the end and I feel it would have been nice to at least have the option to rebind for example - w,a,s,d as any other game would normally allow.

												I was very torn about whether or not to recommend Ittle Dew; on one hand, it’s a delightful game with beautiful graphics and a gameplay reminiscent of old-style Zelda. But on the other hand, it doesn’t feel like complete, cohesive game. I really did enjoy playing the game, which is why I ultimately decided to recommend it. But while the premise for the game is solid and built on nostalgia, I never felt like I was playing anything more than a very long demo. I hope Ludosity recognizes they have a great concept on their hands and create a full-length sequel in the future. Create a larger overworld with a deeper story and a better variety of enemies/weapons, and Ittle Dew will be a name worth remembering.			"

												As someone who plays little to no puzzle games; this game did a good enough job twisting the genre to excuse that bias anyway. I did not expect to like this game all that much; I had picked it up in a bundle this was one of the lesser reasons for me to want to pick up the bundle; at the time. After having played it to completion at least once; I can safely say that it feels like a more puzzily version of an old Legend of Zelda game, which is nice. ProsThe Art Style - I really enjoyed the art style. It's very comically utitilized throughout the game, and suited the mood perfectly throughout.The Difficulty - I felt the difficulty was really well realized. I rarely ran into puzzles or situations that gave me any significant trouble; there were a few times I felt challenged but overall the balance was well realized.The Music - I liked the music. It was ominous where necessary, as well as jaunty where needed. Could get rather old if stuck on a puzzle, but otherwise it was utilized effectively.ConsThe Gameplay - This is more a subjective gripe than anything else; I felt that the gameplay could be rather clunky at times. I think my major issue was more often related to the hit box of the character; there were times, especially when dealing with projectiles, where I would get hit and not feel like it was well represented. It was not common, but happened enough to be annoying. I think the perspective is what complicated it further at times.The Puzzles - Once again, subjective gripe. I don't like puzzles. This game has them in spades. They're all right, but some were complicated enough to frustrate me and pull me out of the experience.The Price Point - I hate bringing it up, but the ""cost-per-hour"" price point is rather lackluster here. True, you can always replay through the game and try to do so differently than before; but I personally don't have much motivation to do so. That said, if you don't mind the price point, you will be in for a good short experience; unless you're even worse at puzzles than I am, in which case you'll likely get your money's worth.At the end of the day I do enjoy this game. It's surprising too given my lack of mirth for puzzle games as a whole, but at the right price point it's a nice experience. I wouldn't recommend this game over many others; but if you find it for cheap enough during a sale I wouldn't recommend against it. Cautiously recommended.			"

												By far my favorite game in my labrary right now.  I thought it was some cute zelda clone at first but it's really a lot more than that.  Where as zelda games focuses on completing temples go gain items and destroy the big bad, this game is more about puzzle solving.  There are only a handful of items in the game to begin with but the most valuable resource you have is your own wit.....and tipsy if you get stuck.  The game is really replayable by challenging yourself with faster times and the last acheivement 'just dew it' will take a while even for the most experienced gamers.  Plus you have the master dungeon which will throw you for a loop with a boss at the end that is quite unexpected.  I cannot say enough good things about this game, pick it up, solve some puzzles and have a glorious time.  I want ittle dew 2			"

												This isn't just a little gem. It's a fresh experience with great puzzles, unique humor, no hand-holding and even multiple solutions. If you like the 2D Legend of Zelda games, this game is for you. It's defnitely a short game, but probably with the most content ever in comparison to the length.			"

												I really liked this game. The puzzels start off really easy but they are nearly impossible at the end (for me). You start off with just a stick and get more weapons/magick as for progres. A few times you lose all your stuff just to get you to use the new weapon/magick. This might seem annoying but you get it back soon enough. I like the fact that the world is pretty much open. Once you encounter a puzzle you can't figur out, you just continue somewhere else. Then you get a new item and suddenly the puzzle makes sense. The little jokes in between are funny, and the storyline is ok. The only negative about this game are the little graphical and audio problems. In the little rooms where the crazy old man was tied up, the foor was just black. I think the texture tiles were missing. And some tiles didn't fit perfectly, leaving a small green line at the side. And I didn't have any sound. I played this on Linux, so I might miss some dependencies. Overall is this a great game to relax, puzzle, smash and admire the art assets.			"

												Ittle Dew is an action-adventure game heavily inspired by the Zelda games with heavy emphasis on replayability and speed-running. Mechanically, Ittle Dew works just about as well as you'd expect. You can walk around, hit enemies, but the real fun comes from the various puzzles. Like a Zelda game, Ittle Dew has an assortment of items that you'll utilize to solve puzzles. However, unlike a Zelda game, where you'll usually find yourself with 7-8 unique items, Ittle Dew only has. This isn't a major issue, for two reasons. Ittle Dew is a shorter game than Zelda games, and two the way that item's works together creates a large amount of replayabilty, due the game's design allowing for puzzles to be solved in multiple different ways. Ittle Dew's three items are a fire sword, which should be fairly self-explanatory, you hit things and light them on fire, a Portal Wand, which allows you to create blocks and teleport objects around and a Ice Wand which allows you to freeze objects. A large portion of the games puzzles are solvable in multiple different ways using any number of the game's items. Even beating the game only requires 2/3 of the items, this encourages exploration in the game world and experimentation with the game's mechanics as you figure out how to get to the end with a limited toolset, and I found doing so to be very compelling. There is also a fair amount of optional content, from hidden collectibles that require optional puzzles to be found, to a couple of optional dungeons. Competetive players will also enjoy trying to figure out optimal routes through the game in order to beat the game quickly.While I can prise Ittle Dew puzzle solving mechanics and overall design, it's not a perfect game. There's some combat throughout Ittle Dew, and frankly it's not very fun. More often than not, I found that having to kill the enemies in a room detracted from the fun puzzles that I should be solving in the room. There's also bosses, but they're mostly one-trick ponies. You'll figure out how to defeat them quite quickly, and they rarely pose a threat. The combat is a minor part of the game, but I can't help but think it could of been more deeply intergrated into the best parts of the game, the puzzle solving.			"

												Ittle Dew puts a unique spin on the formula that started with Legend of Zelda.The puzzles are more varied and interesting than the series this game draws inspiration from.The fact that there are multiple unique paths to victory lends replay value.The only complaint I have is that the controls are SLIGHTLY ""slippery"".Aside from that, if you want to scratch the classic Zelda itch with a more puzzle-heavy game, this will do the trick.Well worth the price.

												Ittle Dew is an action-adventure game that is trying very hard to be a 2D Zelda game, and actually, it succeeds for the most part. Your goal is to explore the castle and use the riches you find to enter other dungeons and find tools that help you progress farther in the castle.This game has two key strengths. The first is that the items are very interesting, and they each combine in interesting ways. The second is that this game has amazing replay value. You get three items, and you can use all three to win, but you only need two. For a challenge, try beating the game with each combination of two weapons. This game is also built for speed-running, and it will take a lot of planning to figure out how to get the speed run achievements.I'd say this game's main weakness is the bosses. It's a big difficulty spike, and the method for defeating them is never straightforward. The hints help a lot, but the battles can still be tough even when you know what to do. That leads to the other weakness: the controls. They're not terrible, and you'll get used to them as you play, but there were too many times when I died in combat because I wasn't moving the way I wanted to, and many enemies aren't knocked back when hit.A few other things to mention: the puzzles can get pretty tough, the death penalty is that you have to restart the room at full health (which isn't even a penalty most of the time), and the game has little story, but the humor was a lot better than I had expected from the previews. Also, the first playthrough will last around 3-5 hours.So, despite this game's rather stupid name, I enjoyed it, and I'd say it's worth picking up if you enjoy Zelda-style games (try out the 2D Zeldas first if you're not familiar with them). I'd wait to pick it up at half price, though.			"

The main game is quite easy, though there is a master cave that is extremely challenging, and there are achievements for beating the game without getting one of the three main items, so there is replayability for this short game.

												It's like a little slice of old school top-down Zelda. The level design is really good. There are a ton of tough puzzles to work through including an optional master dungeon with some truly mind-overloading challenges. The game doesn't rely much on reflexes as the enemies are easy enough to defeat, even in numbers. Where Ittle Dew really shines is in the level design. You will need to think about things, sometimes for a long while, in order to finish. The regular quest takes around 5 hours to finish. I definitely recommend Ittle Dew, especially to Zelda fans.			"

												A smooth little zelda-esque game. Simple enough to be aprochable to anyone but with a good number of extra puzzles one can do to really chalange themselves if desired. There is also a lot of adult-level humor to the game with some amusing bits here and there. Its very short however; the game is only 6-8 hours long unless you want to go back and do a second (or third) playthrough to figure out the challanging puzzles. My other peeve with the game is health and death are trivial; if you die you restart at your current room so other than boss fights, death is little more than a mild inconveniance. Other than that it was a fun game, worth $10 or less. 3/5			"

												As far as Legend of Zelda clones go, this is a pretty good one. The puzzles are fun without being overly difficult (with a few minor exceptions here and there), and the items you get are central to the core experience, unlike some Zelda items which are used for one or two dungeons and forgotten about.Really, my only complaint about the game is that it's too short. However, this can be helped somewhat by trying to replay the game using only two of the three obtainable items, which can quadruple the length of the game if you change the items on each playthrough.Here's hoping for a sequel.

The game is fairly short. It took me 3 hours to beat it but that doesnt include completing the bonus dungeon or getting all of the collectible cards.The game has some good humor and really brings me back to the old zelda days.

It's a fairly short game; I completed it in 2 hours on the first playthrough. There's a castle with a few dozen rooms, 3 item dungeons, various puzzle rooms on the world map, and 2 challenge dungeons which add a couple more hours of playtime. There's also some added replay value in the fact that the game can be completed with any combination of 2 items, taking different routes and using alternative approaches to solve some of the rooms along the way.

												If you like 2D Zelda games then you need this game. It has great humour, a lovely art style, the gameplay is great and the puzzles are satisfying. I can't recommend this enough. At the time or writing I've only played it for 40 minutes and I'm loving it.This is one of the games that has sold me on Steam Big Picture Mode. It's as good a quality, if not a little higher than the 2D Zelda games Nintendo offers. We've already got a decent number of good shooters and action games that work well in Big Picture Mode, it's nice to see something that you'd normally only get from Nintendo.If you don't want to pay full price, it occasionally appears in bundles and goes on sale but it is definitely worth the full £6.99. Ittle Dew is funny, full of charm and Nintendo should be cursing themselves for not locking it down as an exclusive. I recommend this game 100%.Update: I wrote this before reviews could be made public, I tidied it up and fixed a few things. I put just over 9 hours into this game after writing the review and I completed 100% of the rooms and puzzles. I stand by my review, if you like fun then buy this game.			"

												This game reminds you of Legend of Zelda but it's more puzzle heavy than the typical Zelda game.  You shouldn't judge a game by how many dungeons it has but by how much fun you have with that game.  So far it appears to me that there is one large dungeon (the castle) along with four smaller dungeons.  I'm not sure if that is the correct amount but for that price, I'd say that is a good deal and worthwhile (here I go..judging the game by the number of dungeons).			"

Your annoying fairy guide is now a snarky little fox with wings that is constantly drinking -something-.Instead of heart pieces, you collect scraps of paper that, when taped together, you can draw a heart in. Oh, hearts are deliciously edible, and not magically absorbed.I HIGHLY recommend this to all Zelda fans. The gameplay is nearly identical, and there are little nods to Zelda within the game (which makes me believe that the devs are big fans, too).

												Overall incredibly light-hearted, cute and charming adventure game with replay value!If the cross between Metroid and Castlevania is called Metroidvania, this game could be called a ""Zeltroid"" as it looks and feels like a Zelda game but borrows the exploration and use of upgrades from the original Metroid. Although you can complete the game with all upgrades, it is possible with only two of them. Each upgrade-combination requires different paths and I found finding these quite fun.There are many references to other games I do not know or care about but the adorable graphics and sound make it all work well anyway. I wish the controls could be configured in-game rather than with the Unity window, as it does not start well with SteamOS. Once ingame it work fine though.			"

												Meh, it'll do.Kidding, this game is the shiz! Thoughtful puzzles, lovable (and sarcastic) characters, cheerful art style, and playful music make for a great combo. One of the most satisfying games I've ever played and the only one where I've wanted to get all the achievements. Hit up the Master Cave after you beat the castle for some serious fun ;)			"

												Zelda, but funny. Genuinely funny. Ittle Dew plays like the 2D Zelda games, but in its own completely unique world, so it doesn't feel like a cheap copy. The hand-drawn graphics are very charming, alongside the characters as well. The game itself if very short, I clocked in at less than 3 hours on my first run, but provides multiples way to beat the game and earn achievements. My only real compliant about the gameplay would have to be the puzzles, some were fun and enjoyable, while other times they were just repetitive and either way too easy or too hard to actually think through. The game is definitely worth buying if you're looking to fill that dungeon crawling/puzzle hankering.The Rundown +Fun and Familiar Gameplay+HD hand drawn graphics+Funny Plot-Short-Puzzles vary in enjoyment			"

												Man, this one was certainly a pleasant surpise. I expected something at least decent but what I got was a great and clever puzzle game with high replayability and amusing dialogue/parody. The core puzzle gameplay is based around sliding block puzzles, yes, but with interesting mechanics I've not seen done before, especially not all together in the way this game does. Every puzzle feels unique and fresh, and they range from the simple to the mind-numbingly difficult (though I admit that I looked up solutions to a few in the master cave... the harder ones there are also kind of the weakest, lots of secret mechanic stuff you need to know :s )On top of that, there are four different ways to complete the game. You can get all three items or any combination of the two, and the paths you can take through the castle are quite different for each 2-combination. I quite enjoyed working out the different ways to make it through to the end, it kept replays fresh and interesting. The achievement set is also pretty great; a few bonus dungeons, 100% collection, and an added challenge to one of the routes for beating the game without harming a few specific enemy types (only possible via one of the four routes, sadly, and there's a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥move possible right after the final boss if you don't set up the castle properly... but ehh!)The writing is also amusing, toying with lots of RPG tropes (especially Zelda tropes, which is this game's closest comparison to begin with) but not going overboard. It's very self-aware but clearly the devs loved the kinds of games they're mocking.The one weakness of the game is the combat, which is very bare-bones and kind of picky; weapon seems to be a bit shorter than it appears on your character, most notably. It's not a big enough flaw to really detract from the overall experience, though.The main game will probably only run you 3-4 hours by itself, including all the extras, but replaying is worth it even if you're not achievement hunting since it does change the game quite a good bit. I think the price is fair, although I did admittedly get this game via Humble. But in the end I'm quite pleased with this silly little game, it's quite a good time.			"

												This game is truely great. I would certainly recommend it to people who like puzzle games.ProsNice graphics.A nice mix of some really easy puzzles and some really hard puzzles.It's quite short, but getting 100% will take quite a bit of time. I feel the length is ok. Any longer and it would have overstayed it's welcome.You can't really die. When your hearts are empty you simply restart the room.There is a quick room restart/reset option, or you can simply walk out of a room to reset it.Completed/solved rooms will mostly stay solved so you can easily travel through them. This even holds for partially solved rooms.ConsYou can't always complete a puzzle. Sometimes you need other/more tools. I wasted a lot of time and experienced a bunch of frustration before an Internet search told me I couldn't do some of them. But, because you don't know which you can't do, it takes the fun away trying to figure them out.I wish there was a (better) hint system so you could pass puzzles you really can't solve without help.The constant backtracking to find puzzles to solve is a useless time waster. There is a teleporting system, but you'll still walk back and forth the same paths countless times.I personally didn't like the boss fights. I'm not all that dexterous with a controller so failed often. I'm not a big fan of trial-and-error action scenes.You can't really die, so the enemies are mostly a nuisance that gets in your way. I wouldn't have minded it if the game had only the puzzles. "

												With a cute art style and sense of humour, Ittle Dew is good if you don't want to get into anything too heavy. Definitely can be played through in not that much time, though the puzzles in the master dungeon do make you think. Swinging the sword does take a little bit of getting used to (sometimes its hard to gauge whether or not you'll actually hit an enemy or run into it), but I didn't find it overly frustrating.Overall, Ittle Dew is a light zelda-esque puzzle adventure that I would recommend if you're in a semi-casual gaming kinda mood.

The puzzles in my opinion are also much more difficult then some of the top down LoZ games.This game is definitely worth it's full price of $10.			"

												so like there's like a game series called ""The Legend of Zelda"" that you might have heard of and this game is basically a parody of that, and it's also actually really goodAfter crashing their makeshift raft into an island (like a certain other game), hotblooded adventuress Ittle Dew and her potion-chugging sidekick Tippsie set out to rob the island's castle of an artifact, which they need to give to the local shopkeeper so that he'll carve them another raft to leave the island with. It's an entirely lighthearted affair filled with charming characters, whimsical creatures, and colorful sights to behold, and the writing, while a bit too self-aware at times, does a good job at poking fun at the conventions of a typical top-down adventure.Gameplay, as should be clear by now, is like a condensed 2D Zelda. There's a small overworld to explore with caves to spelunk, three main dungeons, two bonus dungeons, and the island's castle, a sprawling, two-story locale which Ittle can only conquer in multiple trips, somewhat like the Tower of Spirits in Spirit Tracks. A variety of enemies roam the island, though it's usually not necessary to kill them because they can only drop hearts, and there are boss battles at the end of each dungeon, including one of the best bonus bosses ever conceived. Treasure comes in the form of Paper Scraps (Heart Pieces), Collectible Cards, and Lunch Money, which Ittle can use at the shop to buy the game's three weapons.What is particularly interesting about the game is how it offers a lot of choices. The main dungeons can be completed in any order, and they as well as the castle have multiple paths to take through them, the shorter ones — ""Professional Shortcuts"" — being tougher to traverse. Astoundingly, the adventure can be finished with either all weapons or any combination of two of them, meaning there are four different ways to beat the game; the game even records players' best times for each combination! Of course, a Zelda parody wouldn't be complete without puzzles. There are TONS of puzzles in this game, involving familiar concepts like block pushing, switches, mirrors and the like. The mandatory ones generally don't require too much thought, but the aforementioned Professional Shortcuts as well as the overworld caves contain puzzles that tended to take me a good five minutes to solve. One of the bonus dungeons, the Master Cave, is made of twelve incredibly difficult puzzles that really stretched the limits on how Ittle's weapons could interact with each other and the environment; some of them were so devious that I resorted to a guide and I was truly flabbergasted by their solutions. Suffice to say, the puzzles were the highlight of the game for me.The only iffy part about the gameplay is the combat, specifically Ittle's basic attack. In most 2D Zelda titles, Link swings his sword in a wide arc, but Ittle only swings in a short line directly in front of her. There were several occasions where I would attack only to miss due to the small hitbox, which usually resulted in me taking damage. Thankfully, enemies aren't that tough to take down regardless, and dying only sends Ittle back to the start of the room.If you haven't watched the trailer for the game on its store page yet, you should do so now because the graphical style of the game is delightful. In addition to being bright and vibrant, the game uses squiggly outlines for characters and moving objects; it reminds me a lot of Ed, Edd n Eddy, which is basically my favorite cartoon to this day. The music, while not as notable, is still pretty good and relaxing.Overall, Ittle Dew provides a surprising amount of pure fun for its scale and price. I clocked in around six hours my first playthrough and I'm already considering going through the game again with one of the two-weapon routes. Highly recommended.			"

												The game is full of cleverly designed puzzles and a great hint system, with very few puzzles feeling like they were unnecessary. The game is a little short, but at this pricepoint it does achieve a respectable 3-4 hours on average the first time, but obviously in less time if you don't do the treasure puzzles. It also has a good amount of replay value. Loads of puzzles can be solved in several ways and there are plenty of shortcuts that require some serious thinking to get through. You can buy the 3 main items in whatever order you want (buying the Ice Wand - the most expensive item - first makes the game significantly harder), you can even reach and beat the last boss without all the items and there are even achievements for doing so; there are 4 separate last boss fights depending on which items you have.Then there's also speed-running functionality built into the game. You can apparently finish the game in 15minutes somehow... I could barely do it under an hour when I tried (without memorizing all the puzzles tho).And let's not forget the lovely graphics and funny dialogue. The ""wobble"" graphics are very unique, quite unlike anything I've ever seen. Kind of like a comic-book game in movement? That's probably the best way I can describe it.The game does have one pretty poor part though: the combat. It's just clunky and kind of serves more as a way to add variation between puzzles. I can't say I've enjoyed the combat in any isometric 4-directional movement game though, so it might not be something everyone is bothered by. The boss fights are better than the other fights as they kind of involve puzzles in the fight.It's a great puzzle game well worth playing. If you're even remotely interested in puzzle games I would recommend giving this one a try.			"

												Ittle Dew is a cute top-down puzzler that seems to draw inspiration from the Zelda series, but in truth, it's mostly the aestheitc that it draws from. This is a puzzle game first, and action-adventure second.Some of the puzzles are quite tricky, even frustrating at times, and I admit, I had to look some of them up. Still, it was fun, and has a good sense of humour about it.A good buy if you like that sort of thing, and a solid choice if on sale.			"

												This may look like a Zelda clone (and it is), but it is so much more than that. Sure, you have the usual mechanics of hacking and slashing monsters of increasing difficulty, you have powerups that let you solve harder puzzles, you have dungeons with bosses that are defeated by your most recent powerup, you have even the same kind of 2-D world, even down to the platforms and bridges. You've even got the same sliding of boxes to unlock doors and using bombs to unlock hidden passageways. But does Link get to MAKE his own boxes? Does he get to warp around within a single room of a dungeon? No, but Ittle Dew does (I think that's her name. Otherwise the title makes absolutely no sense and is completely arbitrary).The main difference between this and Zelda is that there is much more block moving, as this is the main mechanic. You have four main powerups (fiery sword to light things on fire and break ice, portal blocks that act as weights, portal wand that targets things and sends them through where your portals are, and an ice wand that freezes blocks for easy pushing and douses flames.) The puzzles are based on combining all of these weapons to traverse a very Zelda-like dungeon. The difficulty increases as they put you in rooms that are supposed to be solvable but without explaining additional things that you can do with the powerups. (e.g. if you shoot ice on a wall, it makes it reflective, which means you can zap yourself with the portal gun. Took me a loooooong time to figure that out, and it was by accident.)Ittle Dew also has some good meta-humor. It knows it's a Zelda clone, and has fun with it by poking at the various tropes along the way. For example, enemies drop hearts, which replenish your health, but they're actually fleshy hearts that flop to the ground with a sickening squelch, and the character actually eats them like an apple. There's a sidekick animal that is called Tippsie that always looks drunk on whine (though, you can see it's actually health potions).It's not very long, so don't expect Zelda length playtime. Mine was a few hours, mostly because I spent a long time experimenting in just a few dungeons that were giving me trouble for dozens of minutes, whereas the average dungeon took about 2 minutes. The final boss is also a doozy, but mostly because there are 7 stages and it's not clear what you have to do. Fortunately, there are checkpoints after every stage for the boss, and in normal levels, you just go back to the nearest door (not the entrance to the dungeon, as in Zelda, a plus for Ittle Dew!)Overall, I enjoyed it. Probably won't play it again, although there are ""Professional shortcuts"" scattered all around for repeat players who already know some of the advanced move combinations and want to speedrun through. I think for under $5 it's worth it. I got it in a Humble Bundle with, like, six other games, so I definitely got my money's worth in that case. Buy it on sale, especially if you like puzzle games or Zelda.			"

												After discovering this game from a passing mention in forum discussion, I knew that it looked like just the sort of game that I'd enjoy, being very much inspired by the puzzle elements of 2D Zelda (my favourite game series). While the puzzle mechanics that the game uses are more limited than those of Zelda, this allows each of them to be explored more deeply and there are a fair few really taxing puzzles here (I'll admit to resorting to a guide on a few occasions, especially for the 'Master Cave') - making for a very satisfying experience, with that ""aha!"" moment upon solving someof the more intricate rooms.

												It's like a little slice of old school top-down Zelda. The level design is really good. There are a ton of tough puzzles to work through including an optional master dungeon with some truly mind-overloading challenges. The game doesn't rely much on reflexes as the enemies are easy enough to defeat, even in numbers. Where Ittle Dew really shines is in the level design. You will need to think about things, sometimes for a long while, in order to finish. The regular quest takes around 5 hours to finish. I definitely recommend Ittle Dew, especially to Zelda fans.			"

												A smooth little zelda-esque game. Simple enough to be aprochable to anyone but with a good number of extra puzzles one can do to really chalange themselves if desired. There is also a lot of adult-level humor to the game with some amusing bits here and there. Its very short however; the game is only 6-8 hours long unless you want to go back and do a second (or third) playthrough to figure out the challanging puzzles. My other peeve with the game is health and death are trivial; if you die you restart at your current room so other than boss fights, death is little more than a mild inconveniance. Other than that it was a fun game, worth $10 or less. 3/5			"

												There are certain qualities that make a game good.  Good controls, or combat system.  Maybe a fun unlock/leveling system, or a great storyline that sucks you in.  While I can't say Ittle Dew is exemplary by any means (specifically, the ones previously listed) it excels well in understanding its unique charm.  The flaws, in this sense, actually improve the game (subjectively, of course) since the whole game is just filled with character.The Zelda-esque gameplay has been done a hundred times, so you should know the exact gameplay you're getting into--As a side note, it is pretty unique in that its short, but certain items (which all help solve the game's puzzles) can be collected in different orders on your playthroughs, though I admit I've only played through the main game once.My favorite part of this game though was the dialogues--Its very rare in a game do I get excited to drop the controller and see some back  and forths, complete with animated character portraits, that, once again, are filled to the brim with developer charm.The world is colorful and the characters in it are what I'd consider the game's top aspect. With that said, the $10 price might be high, but at $5 or less you shouldn't pass up on playing this game at least once.			"

												Lovely little action/maze/puzzle game a la the 2D Zelda games (Y'know, the only good ones).A little on the short side, but then you realise the game can be solved with any combination of two of the three magic items as well as all three, so there's plenty more puzzling left.			"

												For under 15 ridiculous dollars you get a ridiculously amusing game full of whimsical humor :D Yeah it makes fun of zelda a little (ittle?) but it isn't a ""rip off"" as some have said, it's a nice challenging game on its own merit.For reference, the challenges are trickier than the type of challenges you used to find on the Snes but not as hard as you'd find on the NES. Definitely harder than Lufia (Estpolis)'s puzzles, definitely not harder than say, Ultima IIII very much recommend it for grownups and skilled kids.Parents: If you wanna challenge your kids to start solving puzzles and getting smarter, Ittle Dew is a yea (yay?)

												Fun little Zelda like.  Funny dialogue.  General puzzles are easy, however there is a hard mode area which is extremely difficult.  Game is designed to be speed run so replayability is quite high.  Worth it to pick up in a bundle though, since the game is ~3 hours long with a full (single) playthrough			"

												Ittle Dew is a fun puzzle adventure about every little girl's dream: exploring a mysterious island with her drunken, flying weasel companion. The easy path through the main quest is fairly short, but there's plenty of additional brain-twisting fun to be had in the devilish master cave, as well as the additional challenges of completing the game with different subsets of items.

												After discovering this game from a passing mention in forum discussion, I knew that it looked like just the sort of game that I'd enjoy, being very much inspired by the puzzle elements of 2D Zelda (my favourite game series). While the puzzle mechanics that the game uses are more limited than those of Zelda, this allows each of them to be explored more deeply and there are a fair few really taxing puzzles here (I'll admit to resorting to a guide on a few occasions, especially for the 'Master Cave') - making for a very satisfying experience, with that ""aha!"" moment upon solving someof the more intricate rooms.

												This may look like a Zelda clone (and it is), but it is so much more than that. Sure, you have the usual mechanics of hacking and slashing monsters of increasing difficulty, you have powerups that let you solve harder puzzles, you have dungeons with bosses that are defeated by your most recent powerup, you have even the same kind of 2-D world, even down to the platforms and bridges. You've even got the same sliding of boxes to unlock doors and using bombs to unlock hidden passageways. But does Link get to MAKE his own boxes? Does he get to warp around within a single room of a dungeon? No, but Ittle Dew does (I think that's her name. Otherwise the title makes absolutely no sense and is completely arbitrary).The main difference between this and Zelda is that there is much more block moving, as this is the main mechanic. You have four main powerups (fiery sword to light things on fire and break ice, portal blocks that act as weights, portal wand that targets things and sends them through where your portals are, and an ice wand that freezes blocks for easy pushing and douses flames.) The puzzles are based on combining all of these weapons to traverse a very Zelda-like dungeon. The difficulty increases as they put you in rooms that are supposed to be solvable but without explaining additional things that you can do with the powerups. (e.g. if you shoot ice on a wall, it makes it reflective, which means you can zap yourself with the portal gun. Took me a loooooong time to figure that out, and it was by accident.)Ittle Dew also has some good meta-humor. It knows it's a Zelda clone, and has fun with it by poking at the various tropes along the way. For example, enemies drop hearts, which replenish your health, but they're actually fleshy hearts that flop to the ground with a sickening squelch, and the character actually eats them like an apple. There's a sidekick animal that is called Tippsie that always looks drunk on whine (though, you can see it's actually health potions).It's not very long, so don't expect Zelda length playtime. Mine was a few hours, mostly because I spent a long time experimenting in just a few dungeons that were giving me trouble for dozens of minutes, whereas the average dungeon took about 2 minutes. The final boss is also a doozy, but mostly because there are 7 stages and it's not clear what you have to do. Fortunately, there are checkpoints after every stage for the boss, and in normal levels, you just go back to the nearest door (not the entrance to the dungeon, as in Zelda, a plus for Ittle Dew!)Overall, I enjoyed it. Probably won't play it again, although there are ""Professional shortcuts"" scattered all around for repeat players who already know some of the advanced move combinations and want to speedrun through. I think for under $5 it's worth it. I got it in a Humble Bundle with, like, six other games, so I definitely got my money's worth in that case. Buy it on sale, especially if you like puzzle games or Zelda.			"

												Really fun and challenging puzzle-adventure game in the style of 2D Zelda with a quirky sense of sarcastic humor and non-sequitur plot twists.If you've ever played Link's Awakening and cursed at the Eagle's Tower puzzle where you had to demolish the pillars using the metal ball, this game is full of problems exactly like that and is very satisfying to overcome.  If you don't know what that is, why aren't you off playing that right now?It also has some replay value in the alternative paths you can take to reach the final boss.  At first glance you will think every item is necessary and only obtainable in a fixed order, but with a little creativity taught over the course of playing you will realize any two are sufficient to finish and can be obtained out of order.  Taking these routes also requires solving optional puzzles which are more difficult than the default route.If you're a true sadomasochist (or chive completionist) you can try your hand at the Master Dungeon which is full of all the puzzles the devs had the sense not to put in the main quest.  Sadly the boss of this dungeon is the low point of the game as it requires brute force button mashing and luck instead of skill and ingenuity.			"

												I have very little expectation from bundle games, which is where i got this. But this little game had me paying non stop alot. Was really digging the Zeldaish gameplay and the cartoon style was well done. The story's pretty thin but the characters were pretty engaging. It feels a bit short though (Im pretty sure im almost done after 2 hours) so 10 bucks might be a bit steep for some. I you can catch it at 66%-75% off though i would pick it up cant beat it for that price.			"

												Ittle Dew is a cute top-down puzzler that seems to draw inspiration from the Zelda series, but in truth, it's mostly the aestheitc that it draws from. This is a puzzle game first, and action-adventure second.Some of the puzzles are quite tricky, even frustrating at times, and I admit, I had to look some of them up. Still, it was fun, and has a good sense of humour about it.A good buy if you like that sort of thing, and a solid choice if on sale.			"

												A fantastic little game that plays very much like 2D entries in the Legend of Zelda series.  It's short (there's an achievement for beating the game in 15 minutes or less!) but that allows for multiple playthroughs encouraging the player to skip dungeons.  But why would you want to skip a dungeon in a Zelda style game?  That's actually where Ittle Dew shines!  The puzzles are crafted to let players figure out multiple paths throough depending on the items in their inventory.  Well worth the time if you enjoy this kind of game.			"

												Ittle Dew's a charming puzzle game with fun gameplay and a simple story made unique through humorous writing. When I first got the game, I expected it to play very much like a Legend of Zelda game would. To an extent, this is true, but Ittle Dew is mostly about puzzle solving.The difficulty of the game is around the sweet spot where the obstacles might prove challenging, but never to a point of frustration. This keeps the experience fun throughout.The only problem was the length of the game. The adventure was over before I even realized.Disclaimer:I may have forgotten several details about this game as I'm writing this review 2+ years since I played the entirety of the game,			"

												A masterful parody of the 2D Legend of Zelda games, ittle Dew (lowercase i) takes the well-known item-based puzzle solving of the series and polishes it to a mirror shine, wrapped up in a cheerful and smoothly-animated art style, while layering on enjoyable helpings of wry wit as it pokes fun at traditional video game conventions.  Who keeps putting hearts into rocks, anyways?ittle Dew never wastes time and is built as tight as a drum.  There’s no sprawling overworld, no overly dramatic plot, and no tedious filler; it gets in, delivers the puzzles, and gets out before wearing out its welcome.  The game is comprised of three short item dungeons (which can be completed in any order), a dozen or so optional puzzle rooms, and a central non-linear castle that is revisited multiple times as the player gains more items.  A first run through the game is a casual five hours (more if going for all the secrets), and optional second-run challenges are also available for the minimalist and speedrunning players.The puzzles are a masterwork in this game, relying only on simple tasks (i.e. push a block onto a button) with simple rules (i.e. ice blocks slide until they hit something) that are easy to understand but take careful planning to execute.  Puzzles squeeze every bit of use out of all the items and mechanics presented; rarely will a player encounter the same type of puzzle twice, keeping the game fresh and interesting.  However, a warning:  while the game does give vague hints, some of the more complex item mechanics are never explicitly explained, occasionally leading to seemingly impossible tasks until trial and error leads to a eureka moment.  Fortunately, the worst of these are confined to the Master Dungeon, an optional end-game challenge for people who LIKE impossible tasks.If any nitpick could be made of the game, it would be that the enemies just feel sort of “there”; a necessary construct of the game’s Legend of Zelda roots, but ultimately little more than an annoyance that detract from the puzzle-solving focus of the game.  Common baddies move slowly, deal low damage, and are easily dispatched, while the three item dungeon bosses are largely uninspired, requiring simple puzzles to be solved while dodging their predictable attacks.  The final boss fortunately bucks this trend and is a frantic and satisfying exclamation point to the game.			"

												An absolute blast, I loved every second. That said, everyone here has already sung its praises. I like to talk about game scripts and writing. So if you're looking for a full review, everyone else here has got a pretty good handle on what's good and bad about the game. I wanna talk about its writing.Played it just coming off of Yooka Laylee, which had one of the worst scripts I've ever encountered in a game, but Ittle Dew is comparably comedic, childish and meta-oriented, with 4th-wall breaking jokes coming out of sardonic, goofy characters. The degree to which Ittle Dew trounces Yooka Laylee in its execution, however, is startling.Ittle Dew's writing has three things going for it that make the script not just lovable and silly, but exceptional:-A clever Double Act-Unobtrusiveness-A well-thought out balance of cynicism and heart.A good Double Act is always based on the chemistry between two disparate characters. Abbott and Costello: A no-nonsense straight-man and a clowny, intentionally-frustrating goof. The reason they bounce off each other is because they can create increasing comedic energy from the simple act of interaction.Straight man says a baseline for Goof to comment upon, which straight-man replies to with frustration, which goof replies to with knowing snark and back and forth, a consistent volley of energy that takes a decent amount of time to grow old because neither of characters ever venture into 'unlikeable'.This disparate natures of Ittle and Tippsie are naive, curious energy and sarcastic, exhausted wit. Ittle can respond with curiosity, to which Tippsie responds with cynical resentment, to which Ittle responds with frustrated surprise, to which Tippsie responds with sarcastic acknowledgement, which is a funny volley over and over again, and because they're both characters who are, if not fleshed out, then at least well-established and full of interesting, fun characteristics.As for unobtrusiveness: Ittle Dew's dialogue has a habit of appearing when a new enemy or concept is introduced and right before boss battles. Exceptions are rare. This means that dialogue only appears distinctly at moments when more information would be desirable and, very importantly, only while the game is continuing to be interesting. In the middle of a slow area, where frustration is high and concentration/patience is important, there is a 0% chance of dialogue interrupting anything or presenting itself as a time-waster.Lastly: the game is very meta, but never at its own expense. It's a game who's storyline is ""We've arrived on Video Game Island, I wonder what's in store for us"", and while it makes a few cracks at typical genre conventions, it never accuses itself of not being fun (something that Yooka Laylee did fairly and unfortunately often), it takes as gospel the fact that the player has shown up to have fun and has a love for the genre, and thus mirrors the player's enthusiasm by taking loving jabs and a genuine enthusiasm for the premise and world and gameplay.The ending is character-oriented, which may seem like a weird choice in a plot that's essentially non-existent, until you realize that without the formality of plot, the things we've grown to love over the game's runtime are the gameplay itself and the characters who were enjoying it.It's a delightful game with a delightful story and it doesn't need to be any more than that. Hearty recommend.			"

												Very fun puzzle game that never takes itself too seriously, and the Zelda inspired gameplay is boiled down to simple puzzles and adventuring and a few bits of cute flavor here and there. A lot of the main game puzzles aren't too difficult especially since they're usually designed around 2 of the 3 items you can obtain within the game, and using all 3 items makes most of the puzzles trivial. Where the main game really shines is that you can choose to completely ignore the 3rd item and try to finish the game with 2 items, resulting in different puzzle scenarios and pathways you can take.The only problem that annoys me about this game though, is that some of the hardest puzzles require you to have quick reflexes and some luck in order for you to finish them. Fortunately, most of those puzzles are extra challenges and do not stand between you and the final boss.			"

												Four out of Five Stars.Very enjoyable ittle game. It is well written, self aware and inventive. The puzzles are well designed and the tools that they give you feel genuinely unique. The game does an excellent job of showing you puzzles that you can't solve yet. Then, sending you to a tutorial area, teaching you the skills to solve the puzzle, and then putting you back in the world to use those skills to tackle the problems. Only major problem is performance. The game frequently drops frames and slows down, which is not acceptable, considering the graphics and AI are modest. Otherwise, fantastic.			"
