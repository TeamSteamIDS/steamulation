												This game genuinely makes me happy. The devs succeeded in creating a really atmospheric puzzle game. The music really mellows you out, and the artwork is fitting extremely well done; simple but elegant. The puzzles come in all shapes and sizes with a few minigames for variety's sake. They arent easy enough to make the game boring, nor are they impossible because of the game's voluntary hint system (which I think is clever). Even the one or two hard puzzles that you can't use hints on (I'm looking at you world map) are beatable if you rack your brain a bit and give you a pleasant sense of accomplishment. Its a game that one would enjoy playing between games, something to relax and fall in to after a disasterous game of league, doto, or cs. My only complaint is that this game is too short and that I'm going to miss it when I finish it :c			"

												The Tiny Bang Story is something between a traditional point'n'click and a 'hidden object' type of game. It's biggest flaw is its length. It can be completed in 2 hours and although every puzzle enthusiast will find this time enjoyable, you have to decide whether such a short adventure is worth your buck. The Tiny Bang Story has a ton of puzzles and a great atmosphere. You can't deny that a lot of love has been put into this game. One of my few major gripes however is that you will notice there's a lack of variety, as you progress through this pretty short game. However if you can look past this matter, you will find a rather charming game.The Tiny Bang Story is a perfect lunch break companion, but it doesn't offer enough for a long lasting appeal.			"

												If you liked Botanicula or Machinarium, you'll probably like this game.  It's a mini-version of them-- it took me about 7 hours to finish and I tend to take my time...but it's only $5 and sometimes goes on sale.  But the game is charming, with a nice art style, pretty accessible to a variety of ages, not maddenly difficult but not simplistic either (at least to me).  Could probably be ported to the iPad if it hasn't been already.  It could also be played co-operatively with a son or daughter.The ending is a little disappointing, though...in fact, it's hard to tell that it ended except that there's nothing left to do.			"

Short Version: Recommended, but only if on sale, and mainly for the great art. Seasoned P&C/HOG players will not be impressed by gameplay. If you're colorblind, skip this altogether - the minigames rely too much on color-matching.PROS:+ Beautiful art+ Nice soundtrack+ Smooth mechanics+ Some unique puzzlesCONS:- No real story- Repetitive tasks- No instructions for puzzles/minigames- No choice to skip puzzles/minigames- Includes 2 short but stressful 8-bit 'obstacle-avoidance' action minigames (not what P&Cers are looking to play)- Hint system not very good- Anticlimactic and unsatisfying ""ending"" (if it can be called one)- No replay value.__________________________________Long Version:My feelings towards this game are mixed. I bought it based on all the positive reviews, and while I did enjoy it (mostly), and I do recommend the game (on sale), I still have a bunch of curmudgeonly gripes.STORYIt didn't feel like there was much of a story. The wordless intro clip only show a basic scenario: meteor hits planet, planet breaks into puzzle pieces, you need to find them all and fix the planet. Not much of a plotline, just an excuse for the player to do stuff. The store description says that the world ""fell apart"" and ""its future depends on you"", but I honestly expected a bit more for the main objective than literally putting a picture puzzle back together. And aside from the puzzle pieces, the actual game feels disconnected from the initial ""story"" idea; it doesn't seem like there's any dire trouble to tackle in the world - just finding misplaced parts and accessing new areas. There's not much that connects the minigames, puzzles, and hidden object bits to an actual story, anyway. Yes, the puzzle pieces fix the planet. But how does anything else in the game itself factor into the ""story""? I know that's being nitpicky, but if ""Story"" is in your title, there should at least be more plot-like connections between the tasks a player must complete.GAMEPLAYYou get a couple of initial tutorial arrows showing what to click on, but then you're on your own. The puzzle piece hunt is obvious, but you still have to click around to find out what parts of the scene need ""fixing"". Those bits give you an secondary objective to find a certain number of objects (gears, pipes, dice, etc) to fix the broken part. Sort of a semi-hidden-object hunt. After fixing your ladder/panel/door/whatever, you either unlock another area, or are presented with a minigame/puzzle to complete in order to get the last piece for another secondary objective. Basically, ""Find all the _____, or else you'll never get that last _____."" At least clicks are precise, and the movement between scenes/areas is very fluid.MINIGAMES/PUZZLESMany of the puzzles were very familiar/common in other games. But there are a handful I haven't seen in P&Cs/HoGs before, and the difficulty varied, which was nice. Either way, you get NO instructions once you start. Some are intuitive - like the ""Simon Says"" levers, or a version of that tube puzzle where you rotate pipes to complete a network. But many have you scratching your head before you realize what you're supposed to be doing in the first place. (I spent far too long on the Compass ""puzzle"" until I looked up the solution out of frustration.) At least you can click the red X to exit and reset everything if you mess up.I really didn't like the action 'video game' minigames you're forced to play to continue, and was very glad there were only two. They're 8-bit obstacle games: one guiding a boat up and down to avoid walls, and one moving a plane left and right to avoid trees and planes. If you crash even once, you start over. They're not all that difficult, but they introduce an unwelcome level of stress that I generally play P&Cs/HoGs to avoid. Oh, and forget about finishing the game if you get stuck. You can't skip a single thing. Not cool.HINT SYSTEMThe hint system is cute, but iffy. Click on the blue flies to fill the ""?"" meter. Once it's full and clicked, a red bug will fly out and circle around whatever you're supposed to click or focus on next. The problem is that if you're in the wrong scene within a level, the bug will simply fly to the edge of the screen to the signpost arrow. I understand that means the next 'piece' or whatever is not in the current scene, but when you move to the next scene the bug disappears. So all you really got as a hint was ""Nope, it's not here"". Then the hint bar won't release a bug again for quite a while, even when full. I don't know what the timer is on it, but it's annoying to unknowingly ""waste"" hints like that. It's not difficult to refill the meter, but that really doesn't do much good if you can't use it.VARIETYThe description calls each chapter ""vastly different"". I disagree with most of that. Different, somewhat. Vastly, no. Any major differences between levels are purely cosmetic. It's just different scenes, music, and what type of objects you need to find. The minigames/puzzles themselves are obviously going to be different, but that's expected for any game like this, so I wouldn't consider that a ""vast"" difference. The tasks in each level are pretty much the same: 1) Find all the hidden puzzle pieces.2) Find multiple objects to ""fix"" things so you can progress. Objects are hidden in similar ways in each level (behind panels, overlaying a similar shape, blending into the background, etc).3) Help some random person (usually just a version of ""find this many ____"").4) Solve a handful of minigames or puzzles.5) Put the puzzle pieces together at the end of each level.That said, it didn't take long for it to feel a little repetitive. ENDINGWhat ending? When you complete the world puzzle, you're put in a room with the people you helped out. Initially you think it's a bonus level, but then you realize all you can do is change the radio to play music from each level, and in the next room you can replay each minigame/puzzle individually. Beyond that...what exactly was accomplished? It's very anticlimactic and unfulfilling.REPLAY VALUENone whatsoever. You can't complete a level if you don't find/solve everything, so once you play through, you're done. Maybe it has replay value if you want to revisit a minigame. But I don't see myself loading this up again just to play a puzzle with a 1-minute-or-less solution.CONCLUSIONDespite my nitpicking, I do recommend the game to PoC/HoG fans (wait for a sale though - save the $5 for a latte or something). The lovely art and music are worth a look, at the very least. If the game was any more expensive, I'd probably just go look at some nice galleries on deviantART instead. But honestly I can't comment/complain about value, since I got it on sale for $0.49.Developers: Beautiful game, nice puzzles, but if you advertise it as a story, it needs more plot depth to be ""immersive"" or feel that I'm saving or helping anyone.

How charming could any game really be?This is a question you will be asking yourself several times during the course of reading this review. I maintain throughout that you shall doubtlessly be wonderstruck by this land unless the happy-go-lucky temperament of animation features like Up is fiercely disliked.Note: Played OFFLINE for 3 hrsSteam Client displays the added playtime duration offline, only while offline. It is unfortunate that this resets after reconnecting. So my 8 minutes was purposeful idling to add this review of my three hour offline playthrough.Trusting only the reviews, I bought this game on a whim without much knowledge of what the game was. It is one of those games so darling in its inventions that you'll have to check it yourself to understand the fuss. The art style reminds me of original Pixar sketches and are aesthetically flushed in simple pastels and coloured in complementary contrast tints of green, blue, orange, brown and grey.Unlike the storyline offered in the description, it didn't seem as if I was saving a planet as everything seemed hunky-dory despite the meteor hit. Instead, as I was still fixing odd broken gadgets here and there, it felt as if I were the new mechanic on Tiny Planet and through my work, the tales of its inhabitants were shown to me in a fabular form. These are tales of life and happy souls which will lighten your spirits from all megrims and entertain with a puzzle variety ranging easy to medium which are all jolly good fun. It has been the most enjoyable hidden object game I've played on Steam as through the course of most of this game you will be searching for a variety of items to fix things and open up new paths and stories. Other than hidden object puzzles and jigsaws, the puzzles consist of sequential move puzzles using 2D sliding puzzles as well as tiling puzzles, construction puzzles, 8-bit games, memory games and code breaking puzzles. Keeping in mind that is entertaining and soothing for adults, it hasn't any word games and lacks any true challenge that would be too different to progress through for children. It has the medium difficulty crucial for enjoyment from wider audiences so you'll definitely spend time figuring things out but none will take more than a few minutes for mature or experienced puzzlers.Please sell me this soundtrack ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっThe Steam Library has a Music menu which seemed pointless to a person who'd never really come across any fantastic gaming soundtracks which felt like proper music and not just good game ""BGM"". Despite many titles with fun, and at times brilliant soundtracks, it is rare to find one which you hope will essentially own its own album. Even heavenlier than the Hotline Miami series soundtracks, which made me rave a little too, The Tiny Bang Story is the first game to give me goose bumps over listening to the harmonic music in the background of a GAME. It would often be nudged towards the front of the line to relay an enthralling experience which at times lead me away to a distant dreamland, simply stargazing through the splendiferous scores (no pun). No loot?!!Spellbinding as I found this game, it was a disappointment to know The Tiny Bang Story omitted  achievements, badges and all that good ol' stuff on Steam. When the art is such a joy, I tend to want ""merch"" and medallions as souvenirs of my brave(?) journey. In retrospect, I had bucket loads more fun than any odd puzzle game with delirious achievements and roughly sewn badges. So I am  content without any (still a shame it lacks them). As a side effect to ease the transition into focusing solely on the game without ""side quests"", I had my own achievement creations dinging in my noggin each time I noted something worthy of one happen in-game. A title you'd automatically want to spread to others is a positive sign of its quality as a game. This is another first for me following the scrumptious soundtrack; The Tiny Bang Story is a game to treat yourself, gift to others and share with those close whenever an opportunity arises.　			"

												This Game throws the player straight into the deep end without any instructions or anything its all based on discovery instructions and any dialog are few and far between.  You can gain hints to wear objects are by clicking on the occasional dragon flies that fly around the screen.  It is easy once you get over the lack of instructions on how to play the game to get sucked into its charm, the artwork is beautiful its like interacting with a watercolour painting that has been bought to life, the soundtrack is also relaxing but can get repetative at times.  If you feel like a break like I did from fast pasted action games this is the game for you			"

												This is a casual adventure-lite game leaning towards the hidden object genre but without formal ""finding scenes"". It gets a lot of things right. It has lovely art-work and whimsical world design in the vein of Amanita Designs. It has decent relaxing music. It seems solidly put together and doesn't suffer some of the technical issues of other casual market games of similar vintage with things like alt-tab.Where it goes a bit wrong is in the mini-game designs. It contains ""arcade"" mini-games, which many players of these sorts of games are not looking to play. It also has some of the worst examples of colour-blind ignorant puzzle design I've ever seen. It literally has a puzzle where the only ""can you work it out?"" element is whether you can see colours correctly or not. What makes these choices unforgivable is that the mini-games are unskippable. If you can't complete one then that's it, no more game for you. These are really terrible design choices that will kill the game for many people and that's why I can't recommend it.			"

You can have something like 4-5 hours of casual fun.You can replay all puzzles after finish the game without having to play the whole thing again. Personally, i was not interested to replay any when i finished the game, but after a few months without touching it, i'm tempted to replay the whole game some time, so i think it worth even the full tiny price.

												A gorgeous and somewhat challenging hidden-object game, with several nice puzzles and a few simple mini-games.Well, I recommend it, but keep your expectations low. There is no story and no point-and-click adventuring: your only task is to find all the objects, and they are quite hard to find indeed! Supposedly you need to collect all the puzzle pieces, but I did not and still completed the game.If you've enjoyed the audio-visual style here, I strongly recommend Amanita Design's games--Machinarium, Botanicula--which offer wonderful stories and much more gameplay.If you've enjoyed the gameplay here, well, ""hidden-object games"" is a huge genre. There are many excellent ""HOGs"" on Steam. Welcome aboard!Finally, I'd like to thank the developer for supporting Linux.			"

No worries if you can't find a hidden object, the flies will help you. There is also an interesting little story to the game if you're paying attention. Nothing deep, just a little history of the townsfolk. Definitrly recommended for those looking for something casual and relaxing.			"

												The game has a nice art style and the music is great, with each area in the game (of which there are about 5) having it's own style. The puzzles are kind of basic and will have you looking for certain objects around the area to unlock them and giving you further items to progress the game. You'll get at least a few hours of fun for your money and completing the game gives you access to a menu that allows you to replay any puzzle you want, so you can see if you can beat your previous efforts (although there is no built in timer).I'd definitely recommend it if you are a puzzle fan but want a more casual game rather than true mind benders, but without the monotony of something like sudoku.

												Tiny story indeed. A soccer ball hits the world and turns it into a jigsaw puzzle. There's your story. The ending is even worse. Of course it has somewhat of an excuse: it's a very casual hidden object game; lots of tiny things to click on, pretty art set at a relatively tiny (but acceptable) box resolution and a tiny amount of options/configuration.You're thrown into a scene of half a dozen screens or so and left to click on things for goals to pop up, usually to find X amount of other things to progress or solve a puzzle. There are several areas and maybe 25-30 explorable screens total, not counting puzzle screens. You also find jigsaw pieces throughout and piece some of your world back together on the title screen after each major area.There are sliding, jigsaw and pipe puzzles and other minor brainteasers. The best thing I can say about the game is it looks very nice and is charming, the worst that it leaves you feeling you accomplished very little, if anything at all.			"

												I genuinely really love this game. It's pretty, has a lovely soundtrack, and isn't really so challenging that it puts you off playing. There are only two moments that really feel like a drag (the boat and the plane), but they barely tarnish my enjoyment. The characters are all entertaining to look at, and their connection with the man who seems to essentially have built this world is quite sweet. I would strongly recommend buying this at full price, but it sells for 99p durig sales if you're unsure.			"

												Puzzle, adventure and HOGs are my go to games between my hardcore stuff or when I have nothing to play. They are typically very short and while they can be head scratcher as far as the puzzle solving, they are just about always relaxing to play.Tiny Bang succeed on all levels in my book. Actually this is the type of game I would like to spend 100 in and not 10-20. The art style is reminisent of animation done in the 70s and 80s. Actually the game reminds me of the cult movie classic Fantasitc Planet. Just a very fun game to play. "

												I was not blown away by this game.  It had zero storyline; which was surprising given the description of the game.  The puzzles were mostly boring & not challenging.  Then there were a couple that were not logical at all which made it difficult to figure out what they were asking you to do, leaving you wanting to look for walkthroughs.  Overall I just didn't find this to be a good entry in the point & click genre.  Reminded me more of those P&C where you're just clicking on items to move through the chapters.			"

												Charming game. Cute art, nice relaxing music.Your mission is to put the world back together by finding all the puzzle pieces from each level to puzzle together the next one until you've finished building the world. A casual playthrough takes a bit more than 2 hours.Some hidden objects can be quite hard to find/see. Imo the hint button recharges too slowly. You need to click 20ish flies on the screen for them to fill up to give you a hint charge. I don't mind games being hard, but this is just inconsistent with the relaxing, casual feel I get from the rest of the game.The minigames are mostly fairly easy. The computer game simulating games are really frustrating though. Extremely slow, I ended up killing myself more than once by crashing into walls because the little ship/plane was so slow.The jigsaw puzzle at the end of each level a have too many pieces. I quite like jigsaw puzzles, but it just takes too long and I lose interest and get bored of it. You have to discover the puzzles to be able to pick up the items needed for them, like Morphopolis, which isn't too much of a problem as they're mostly obvious and easy to find. Overall worth buying if you're into point&click/hidden object games, but be aware of a few frustrating elements.			"

												Normally I don't like the hidden object style of puzzle game, but this one was better. Instead of hunting through the same bad art and static images stretched beyond recognition, The Tiny Bang Story has beautifully drawn art. The objects are not necessarily all identical, e.g. You need to find many balls, but they could be three different colors. That said, each objec is recognizable.Mixed in are several jigsaw, sliding tile, simple sidescrolling video, and matching minigames. These help break up what could become a slightly monotonous find-the-thing game.It's simple, relaxing, and well-made, if a bit short.			"

												A 2D indie puzzle game, Tiny Bang Story is very... Tiny. It's seriously short. No more than 3 hours, and that's being generous, slow and appreciative of the art. Unfortunately, as beautiful the art, music, and puzzles are, it's just nowhere near worth the $10 price. That's about as much as a movie ticket and it lasts about just as long, but one you're done that's it, no big ending of satisfaction, not much of a ""story"", contrary to the title. That being said, if you think $10 for 2 - 3 hours is worth it, go for it. I'd reccommend waiting for a $5 or less price tag.

The graphics are cute and the music is very minimalist and while widescreen is not supported, the Steam Overlay works correctly.  I found myself compelled to keep playing and unlocking the next stage, and if you are a fan of the genre, you will certainly enjoy this title.

												A nice, if unspectacular point and click, hidden object game. Throughout five chapters, each made up of about four screens filled with things to interact with, you'll click on various people or mechanisms to initiate quests to find some hidden items they require. Once found and brought back, it will typically trigger a mini puzzle of some kind and give you another item upon completion that'll help you progress further. That's basically the long and short of it.There is some kind of story about a meteor hitting ""Tiny Planet"" and scattering the world apart in the form of jigsaw pieces which are hidden all over the place, but it's largely inconsequential and serves only to back up a puzzle mechanic and explain how you access each chapter in turn (even though the jigsaw pieces aren't actually necessary to move on). There also seems to be a recurring character that appears in paintings and photographs showing him at different stages as he grows up, but the significance of this is never explained. Presumably we're retracing his steps in places that either he had an impact on, or which had an impact on him. It's hard to tell, and to be perfectly honest, even harder to care, since this is never expanded upon in any meaningful way or as any clear goal for the player.Most of the puzzles and hidden objects are pretty fun and fair deals, but occasionally there's the odd obscure one that will have you either losing all faith in humanity, or else looking up a guide. I'm also really not a fan of them messing with the scale of the hidden objects, like having large jigsaw pieces in one place, then other, much small ones in other places yet still at the same distance away from the camera perspective. More consistancy of scale with the objects would be appreciated.You'll have a fun, if not somewhat forgettable, two or so hours with the game, and have the option to replay any puzzle when you reach the end... which is possibly the most anti-climactic end I've ever experienced in a game. But I'd still recommend it for anyone looking for a quick break through a visually pretty world with some fun and engaging puzzles.			"

												This is not a game to get tense. This is not a game to be stressed. This is not a game to rush This is a game to relax, calm, and breath.Go back to those days of playing I Spy or Where's Waldo from those books mixxed with hide and seek with items and a bit of camouflage as well. Then put in a few puzzles into the mix to spice it up.That's what this game is. There is a demo you can try out on the game's store page.The music is soothing, the world is surreal in a good way, and you just want to escape from this bleak world into something new and refreshing.The full price is worth it.Only issue I had was that I couldn't get the intro to play again... only once when I tried the demo few months back. There is one puzzle that is more trivial than the others that it feels a bit annoying to solve.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

Often I already saw many objects that are supposed to be collected, but I haven't reached the neccessary ""quest"" to do so. That was a bit annoying, but after a couple of minutes I got used to that.Some minigames were annoying, maybe because I hadn't developed the correct strategy or maybe I was unlucky and missed the solution. But overall it was a pleasent experience. Everything in this game is family friendly.If you like puzzles and HOGs, don't hesitate, go and play this game			"

												This game is absolutely adorable, but sadly very short.  Finished the whole thing in 4 hours, and it just... ended.  No rewarding end cutscene of awesomeness or anything.  As short as it is, I was suprised that it had a couple of bugs.  On level 2, I found extra puzzle pieces, then on level 3, it let me through with still 4 to collect.  A few things that were a little disappointing here and there, but overall, just a heartwarming experience.  Buy it when it goes on sale for under a dollar, it's worth it for a relaxing afternoon.

												Do you like pixel hunts?  That's all this is.  If you enjoy that sort of thing, it's a cute and quirky little game.  If you don't, there's enough backtracking and minute pointless nonsense to turn you off before you get far.  It's an indy game, it's not big, it's unfair to levy high expectations.  Still, the measure of a game is whether you're having fun or not.  I'm in the category of folks who is annoyed by pixel hunts and doesn't care for nonsensical puzzles (good-bye, most adventure games).  So ask yourself what you enjoy, and it'll let you know whether this is your sort of game.			"

Of course there are a few tricky puzzles and difficult to find items, but overall it's pretty casual and laid back.  My only critique is that you don't have to find all of the puzzle pieces to beat the game. A word of caution though, this is best played  in a few sittings.  It's short enough to complete all at once, but you'll find the game tedious and repetitive if you do.  Give yourself some time to enjoy this.8/10			"

												This game really made me feel good. SPOILER ALERTI love this game because its a puzzle, you have to 'restore' the planet that was hit by a meteorite. There are 5 chapthers. IN each chapter you have to colect a number of puzzles which is so adorable because you if you feel stuck there are little bugs  that could be used at hints, you click a number of bugs ( i think 20 ) and you have a yellow bug that gives you a hint. Those puzzles are used at the end of the chapter when you have to restore parts of the planet. At the end of the game you have all the puzzles available at your own pace. PROSYou have unlimited time to complete the puzzles/game.You have hints.Its easy and enjoyable.Its not too long and not too short, the exact lenght for this kind of game.Nice ambiental music.Amusing puzzles in game.Really nice graphic.CONSYou cant skip the puzzles.The hints dont give you the 'hints' you want for what task you want, but for a random task.No replay.ENDINGThere isnt actually an ending to the game, I mean its very unsatisfying, butfrom mpv the ending is perfect for this type of game, I mean there are chapters and the same ending to all of them ( a puzzle ). I recommend this game :3  "

												Tiny Bang Story is a tiny point-and-click adventure -- less than 3 hours for me -- that is partly a puzzle game and partly a hidden objects game. There are no words, very little instruction, and almost no replayability. But the artwork is enchanting and, despite the (very minimal) backstory of repairing a shattered planet, the ambience is cheerful and soothing. It felt endearing and unexpectedly satisfying to jigsaw puzzle a broken planet back together again, section by section. If you can get it on sale and enjoy finding hidden objects and solving puzzles, this little game will take you on a charming, bite-sized adventure.			"

												This game is a hidden object game. It's actually a very good one, I played it with my 5 year old daughter who enjoyed the various mini games and hunting for the pieces. I don't like hidden object games I find them repetitive and boring but this one along with the artwork, jigsaw sections and mini games came together very well. It's a relaxing game. A game to play when you have a 30 minute break and don't want to get into a long haul or story rich game. I would buy the sequel . If you enjoy Hidden object games you will enjoy this, if you have a young child who likes to play games this is a good one you can play together and if you just want a casual and relaxing game this is one of the better hidden object games.

This game contains several types of puzzles that you need to figure out in order to go through each level:  finding hidden object, matching patterns, discovering hidden areas,...  So if you like puzzle games, ""The Tiny Bang Story"" will be a lot of fun.But there is more!  Each panel of hand-drawn art offers a beautiful background for all your puzzling fun.  The music is pleasant and happy (instead of annoying, cheesy, or elevator-like); the characters help you out; the big jigsaw puzzle fun to put together.  This game even has a built-in hint system.  Catch enough fireflies and the hint button in the upper right corner will fill up with blue, available to you in most areas of the game when you just need a small nudge to finish a challenge.Overall, I love ""The Tiny Bang Story"" and I recommend it for all puzzle lovers.

												I paid $0.49 for this game.  At that deal, I definitely recommend it.  Not sure if I would recommend for the $4.99 full price.  It is a short game; over in about 5 hours.  I think the developers did a good job with the artwork and puzzles.  It is a mixture of hidden object and puzzle game.			"

Well worth it.      10/10 for this game. The only negative, IF you can call it a negative, is that it's just not long enough.   :P Hope they make (with the same lovely graphics) a sequel for it.			"

												The best puzzle/hidden object game you can get for 1,24€ - I bought it on sale, just to make things clear - and this is coming from a person who utterly despises the hidden object concept.Everything about this game oozes charm and uniqueness. The world is beautifully drawn, the music will help you relax after a long and difficult day, while the puzzles are not very difficult to solve. There are a few puzzles that might get you stuck, but there's no shame in checking the Internet for walkthroughs when it comes to this game. As for finding the hidden objects/puzzle pieces - as with every other game in the genre, some are instantly detectable, while others blend with the game background, so you will have to do the occasional click-all-over-the-screen thing. Even though I hate this element in games, The Tiny Bang Story is an exception - its atmosphere, music and style kept me going.The hint system in this game is interesting - Other than showing you what you're supposed to do with the puzzles through illustrations, you can use it ONCE after you get enough mosquitoes and it will reveal the location of a puzzle piece you're supposed to collect. Then, it's getting mosquitoes all over again. Unfortunately, once you finish The Tiny Bang Story, there's no replay value whatsoever. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the 4.7 hours I spent playing it and recommend it to every gamer out there.			"

												An incredible. I bought it for just $10 pesos (like $0.99 dollars or even less).I expected it to be very simple and boring, basically a broken game coded in one day or so. I could not be more wrong.Here, the flaws of the game:- It doesn't support high resolutions. At least in my machine, it can run only on 1024x768, even on fullscreen.Here, the good things about the game:- Very good music. Is very relaxing. I loved the main title music, is just... good, soft, I can't describe it.- Well made puzzles. Some of the puzzles presented are easy, even trivial, but others (like the Worl Map or the Tetris Like pieces)... oh boy, they are complex, even when you know what you need to do. A couple of puzzles, I think, need more explanation to really know what you are supposed to do, but they are still very good.- Pieces very well hidden. You need to find puzzle pieces. To do it, you need to solve some problems. To solve the problems, you need to find other pieces. To find other pieces, you need to solve other problems. A very interesting way to play, I think.- Makes you think about your actions. Mostly at the two last levels, I learned, the hard way, that you need to first search for all the puzzle pieces that you can fin *before* completing a problem, because the problem for which you already have the needed pieces might be the las problem to solve and you will be transported to the next level, even when you have not found the remaining puzzle pieces yet.I truly recommend this game. If you can afford the game, have time to spend, like to think about problems and have a big screen (to compensate the more or less low resolution), then, you need to buy it.			"

												The bulk of Tiny Bang Story is a hidden objects game. You start out searching for jigsaw puzzle pieces, and as you interact with things you are informed of other things you need to find in order to access puzzles. When you complete enough puzzles on the few screens for each level, you are taken to the world screen to place the jigsaw pieces. There are five levels, and 25 puzzles.The art direction for this game is fantastic, and the music, while repetitive, is rather soothing. This is definitely a game to play for relaxation and puzzle solving; there is no hardcore setting in Tiny Bang Story. There's also no story once you start playing. I streamed the game expecting something engaging, and did not get that.GameplayThe hidden objects portion of the game is tedious, but there are little blue flies you can click on to fill up your hint ball. Once the hint ball is full, you can click on it to send a red hint fly around the screen to orbit an item you haven't yet clicked on. If there are no such items on that screen, nothing happens, and you know you haven't missed anything on that screen.Most of the actual puzzles are fairly rudimentary, and are things you've seen before. There are a couple that are very good though, most notably the water pipe puzzle in the last level. It is absolutely possible to solve it from scratch, and it is easily the most challenging puzzle in the game.The worst puzzle is the astrolabe puzzle in level 3, which isn't a puzzle at all: you just rotate the thing until the lines all line up. Level 2 has what's basically a Simon machine, which is also not really a puzzle, and there are a handful of minigames scattered throughout as well.One thing worth noting is that it doesn't actually matter whether you collect all the jigsaw puzzle pieces, as you will always have the correct amount upon completing a level. Also, three spoilers that will make your game a lot easier: the wheel for the train is in the example diagram, both clear flasks in level 2 are downstairs, and you must rotate the astrolabe counter-clockwise in order to finish it quickly.I finished it in 4 hours, and a fair portion of that was on level 1 while I was still getting used to the game mechanics. There's also no replay value, especially considering what the ending is. I give it a 6.5/10, and I'd say it's worth playing if you can get it on sale.			"

												This game is a mix of puzzle solving and looking for items. Most items are cleverly hidden within the artwork and the background, often so well that you don't realize they are what you are looking for although they are right in front of you. The music is very nice and relaxing and the fact that you have to find puzzle pieces and put them together between each scene is a nice touch. All in all it is a neat little game that feels a little too short at time but definitely serves its purpose. There is no real ending to it and might leave you wanting more.			"

												I got this game on sale and didn't quite know what to expect, as point-and-click and hidden object games not usually a genre I play, but this game has totally converted me. I expected it to be dull but was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It is, as the title suggests, a tiny little game; but it has lots of character. It didn't take too long to complete, but I had lots of fun doing it.The scenery is very unique, and the graphics totally draw you into the tiny world, where you move from level to level trying to find hidden pieces, which in turn unlocks the next step or puzzle, which in turn unlocks the lext level. But don't let the simplicty fool you into believing it's easy. Although the puzzles and hidden obects are not impossible, some are rather tricky. It will definitely get your brain working. Good fun 7/10			"

												In theory, ""The Tiny Bang Story"" is a Hidden Object Game (HOG).  In reality, it's not.  Yes.  There are teeny tiny little objects to be found throughout the game.  But, that's not what a HOG is.  It's not really that important since other things swamp my rating.  But, it's something to be aware of.  The big thing that hurts the game is that nothing (absolutely nothing) is explained.  We're dumped into a setting with no idea what we're supposed to do, how to do it, or why.  The next biggest issues is somewhat related:  once we figure out what we're doing, we get into mini-puzzles.  But, once again, we're given no idea what to do with them.  Most of them can be figured out with the hint they give us.  But, some of them remain entirely opaque (I finished several by blindly flailing around with the mouse and never understood what I'd done to ""succeed"").  Next, as we move around the screen looking for those hidden objects or the secret areas they might be in, the cursor doesn't change to indicate any ""hot"" zones.  Basically, the game turns into a click-fest because we have to click on every single thing we see in case it's important.  And finally, the puzzles and objects aren't necessarily ""necessary"" to the game.  In the second area, I skipped a puzzle so I could come back to it later.  I ended up brute-forcing another puzzle which, I think, the puzzle I skipped was supposed to open.  The game happily let me do this and leave the area without ever finishing that puzzle.  In the third area, I finished the last puzzle before gathering the last hidden puzzle piece.  When I placed the object from that last puzzle where it belonged, the game happily moved me from the area and gave me all the puzzle pieces I needed for the world-puzzle.I got 4.0 hours of game-play out of this.  So, the list price is a bit high purely from a dollar-per-hour aspect.  But, even if the game were much cheaper (heck, I paid 50 cents for it), the issues I noted above just put the game into the Not-Recommended area.			"

Short version: 81%An enchantingly beautiful hidden object type game which is also a perfect tool for teaching children. The short length may not keep you occupied for more then a few hours, but that will be one of the most wonderful few hours you spend in front of your monitor.Long version:The Tiny Bang Story is a short and sweet hidden object puzzle game. Since these kind of games are a dime a dozen, it’s hard to stand out among them, and luckily Tiny Bang Story knew exactly how to do it: with its style. All scenes feature gorgeous hand-drawn graphics which also help hiding the various collectible objects, since they blend in even more than in some other hidden object games.Apart from the visual style the game is aiming for an interesting artistic goal: not a single word is spoken, nor there is any kind of writing, anywhere, apart from the mandatory main menu. Everything is told by visuals, which is always a great challenge for any artist, and the game achieves this flawlessly.This also makes the game perfectly suitable for little children, which is also supplemented by the modern (somewhat steampunk-like) fairy tale theme and the soothing music. It’s not a child’s game per se as it’s more than enjoyable for adults too, but it may also serve as a really good tool to help the cognitive development of the little ones.The negatives? The game’s puzzles are set, so replay value is fairly low. Also, the game is quite short, shorter than some Big Fish Games hidden puzzles, clocking around 2-4 hours. And the downside of the hand-drawn graphics is that the game has only one resolution (naturally it supports full screen and windowed modes).			"

												For me, hidden object games are taking one of the worst elements of traditional point-and-click adventure games, pixel hunting, and making that a genre. I don't understand the appeal and find it frustrating and stupid in general.I enjoyed some of the other puzzles in this game, but the couple that are roadblocks to your progress are at odds with how easy the game is in general.The jigsaw section that you play between levels is garbage, as the pieces change colour after being placed, so you can't even match some of them properly.The graphics are quite nice and remind of Samorost a bit, but could use some more click interactions with background objects; like clicking a bell would make it swing and ding.If you enjoy pixel hunting games for some reason you may have a better time with this than I did, but I wouldn't recommend it.Try Machinarium, Botanicula, or Safecracker: The Ultimate Puzzle Adventure instead, which I actually enjoyed.

												It's very pretty, and it starts out strong, but tedium and repetiition set in when each chapter repeats the theme of finding an array of hidden objects to first reassemble and then work your way through proper puzzles, with a few reflex tests thrown in on a few occasions. Each chapter ends with you literally putting the tiny world back together with twenty-five (!) puzzle pieces painstakingly found in the last world. Unfortunately a good third of the jigsaw is lightly cloudy or starry space, which makes many of the sky pieces nearly identical to a glance.There's a built-in puzzle-spotter, which is obnoxious. To charge it for a single activation, you have to click thirty (30!) small, flying insects, which is simply punitive. There are also 'solutions' available for each puzzle, but be aware that many are reversed, incomplete, or actually wrong.The game has maybe two hours worth of play. A tiny amount of time for a tiny bang, I suppose.			"

												This is a cute game.  Nice artwork, not-too-annoying music, decent puzzles/hidden object finding.  HOWEVER, if you're not running this under Windows, be aware that your mileage may vary.  I'm running Linux and a little over halfway through my playthrough, it has decided to crash.  Repeatedly.  I cannot complete the game, in fact.  In the community discussions, I see that I'm not the only one to have this problem in the same exact spot.  I presume this is a problem with the Linux/Mac port, or there wouldn't be so many people happy with the game.  So...short and sweet if you're on Windows, possibly even shorter and not so sweet if you're on a different platform.			"

												Colibri Games created a really fantastic, graphically highly appealing game with ""The Tiny Bang Story"". Not unlike Botanicula, this game is like balm for the eyes, with a great graphic style drawing you into the game, and with very, very relaxing and fitting music for every level.Tiny Bang Story is a relatively short game, again much like Botanicula. But that is also the appeal of it. It really invites to play again. But the really strong point, in my opinion, is the game's puzzles. And believe me when I say that they are absolutely not easy.Overall, I would say that I'd absolutely play this game again. But first, I have to make sure that my backlog doesn't consist of about 200 games. Still, I'll return to this adorable game for sure!			"

												The Tiny Bang Story is a really relaxing mixture of a point'n'click adventure (in the sorts of machinarium) and a hidden object game with a few minigames thrown in.It features wonderfull music, a nice artstyle and everything from far to easy to challening mind puzzles.There is nothing bad I can say about this game except one thing: It's way to short.Do yourself a favour and don't use a solution on this one, you will regret it, because it will be over before you notice. You have been warned ...I bought this game as a boxed version before I got the version here on Steam. The boxed version even features some nice printed artworks and a soundtrack. Sadly the soundtrack is missing here on steam. I think for the normal retail price of 4,99 € the soundtrack should really be within the package.So I recommend you to get this game on discount. I'd say 1,99 € would be fair only because it really is that short.			"

												This games has a bug that stranded me halfway through and I was too bored with it to start over, even though it's not that long of a game.  The puzzles are mostly searching for stuff hidden in plain sight, and other puzzles are really difficult, since half the trouble is figuring out what to do.  I can see it would appeal to some people, but I was disappointed.    Music is good and the pictures are awesome, the puzzles are hit and miss, so I tried to give the game a second chance.  I started over a spent hours progressing past where I was, so like 3/4 way through I accidentally progressed through the stage without having all the puzzle pieces.  I was able to place the pieces but when I was 2 pieces short, I was again stranded and had to manually stop the game.  Reloading, I was at the very beginning of the level, and it miscounted the number of bags I found, so I was again unable to continue.  That's 3 game-breaking bugs, and I won't complete it.  WTF			"

This is just as good as the old PC disc I-Spy games, but this game gives you objectives to do to require to power each level. If you're struggling on an objective, collect some flies and send out a Hint Fly. These little friends give you hints, and they are not limited. I'd say that this game is actually the best Point & Click game as of now.			"

												I got this for 99p during a sale and glad I didn't pay more than that. Point-and-click, hidden object, casual. Visuals are pretty, music is soothing, but there is little reward in finishing this game. Each one had a very vague hint and some didn't make any sense - leaving me a bit frustrated. If you don't get all the puzzle pieces per stage, they give them to you anyway. I did like that you put the pieces to the jigsaw after each bit. Would have liked it to be longer, have more story, achievements, punishment/reward for getting all the things, and a way to get more hints per puzzle.Edit: Played the game a second time through only because of cards. The frustration and anger is the same in 2016, but turning the sound off helps (mosquitos bzzt pitch really got to me). Clicking the mosquitos only trickle the hint meter and each have a small click box as they move around. And even though the puzzle pieces collected in each zone mean nothing, the mosquito hints will tend go to puzzle piece instead of an actual hint to find other objects. Another thing is that the foreground and background still like to merge which isn't helpful. I mean even if you're into hidden object games, it'll save you the stress to pick something else.			"

												Wile the game is pretty, that is about all it has going for it sadly. With almost no story to speak of, a very poor hint system, and a couple of rather ill fitting mini games, and no real ending this game is really not great.			"

												Oh, it is so charming.But this doesn't redeem one of the most aggravating HOG experience I ever had - and I am fond of the genre.It's got all the mistakes from a game done by people who got carried away in their own design: confusing artwork, an obnoxious hint mechanic, poorly designed extra puzzles.Most terrible of all for a title of this genre, the game encourages you to swipe the screen for items you can't be bothered to find anymore.If I wanted to waste both my time and my mouse, I'd play a Diablo clone, thank you.Back to Artifex Mundi!

												I'm not quite sure what I was expecting... Looking for a different type of game, it's different - for sure. While I'm not a huge fan of point-and-click games, this did seem interesting and different from the preview and pictures. Not helpful, images mesh in and I don't understand why or how the puzzle pieces fell away. Maybe it explains further in the story, maybe it never does, but how does a fireball hitting a soccer ball blow away half the world (via puzzle pieces) but still leave enough for me to explore? Why am I doing this?			"

												Weeeell, this game happened. It's pretty exclusively a hidden-object type game with a few minigames/puzzles for a bit of variety, but really they're minor. Nothing here's really too difficult nor too easy but it probably makes for a decent kid's game I'd expect, what with the vibrant colors and art style, as well as some soothing music. There's a few of the minigames that are stupid/boring/tedious (two of them, to be precise) and a few others that I guess are decent puzzles but boil down to trial and error for most of us. There's also no story to speak of, it's pretty much pure gameplay. I suppose there's not a lot to dislike here necessarily but there's realy not a lot here to begin with, either. Decent entertainment for a short while but nothing to write home about.			"

Thus will be more or less challenging depending on who you are.The game has no guide, no tutorial, nothing, you are just tossed into this beautiful world and only told to find puzzle pieces.

												Playtime: 4h20m (Online + Offline)The Tiny Bang Story features a combination of various game styles. Mind challenging puzzles, objects for you to collect (point&click style) and puzzle assembling. The background story dictates that the world is hit by an asteroid and your mission is to assemble it back to the paradise it was before. The soundtrack is really enjoyable and the hint system is actually clever (minus the annoying buzzing sounds). Overall, I recommend The Tiny Bang Story as it is a clever little game that will entertain you for some time.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442117878 "

												What I imagine the devs talked about before this game:- Hey, let's make the most boring game ever. Like gnaw off your leg boring- How 'bout a HOG, but instead of a story and puzzles, the player will just collect a bunch of items from the world. Like 8 gears for one machine and stuff.- Will we include the hint button? Yes, but we'll make it useless. If it's supposed to point into a puzzle location, it will not work. Also, it will not recharge with time, we'll make the player hunt little bugs floating around the screen.- Oh, and we'll make the world a jigsaw puzzle, but only a tiny part of it will be open. So in every level, the player has to find a bunch of jigsaw pieces and then assemble them to open the next part. And at least half of the pieces will be the sky, with no ♥♥♥♥ing difference between them.- Why don't we add a click counter that sends clicking stats back to us, so we can have a laugh at how the poor players click around?I couldn't verify the last part, but nonetheless: there's nothing here that's remotely fun or interesting or engaging. The only word that comes to mind in connection with this game is AVOID.			"

												A nice little point and click puzzle game. I ceratinly would have finished it if not for the colour reliant puzzles. I would like to leave a thumbs up but I can't. If you have any issues with colour vision don't bother. Otherwise enjoy.			"

It's so casual it's horizontal, and you can finish it in a couple of hours, but it's very pretty and you'll have had fun doing it.I would hesistate to recommend it at full price though as it's a little expensive for what it is, but if you see it in a sale, grab it.

												To summarise my major emotion about TTBS: it's frustrating.The game has a sharp, yet storybook-like art style, catchy (though quickly monotonous) music, and a hidden object/puzzle/adventure gameplay. I love all of these features, then what went wrong?The game basically doesn't contain any written or spoken text, and any hints it gives about objectives or solutions are extremely sparse and unhelpful. Thus a significant portion of my playtime was spent wandering around the same handful of screens, trying to figure out what the game wants me to do.Once you do figure it out, the rest of the time is spent either hunting minute objects that you've passed many times before, but only become collectable when the game decides to do so, or doing one of the quite difficult puzzles (without a skip function and barely a single hint! annoying!) or one of the timed minigames (which really don't fit to the otherwise quite laidback gameplay).To acquire any kind of help from the game, you have to collect 30 little floating bugs for each use of the hint button, and even then it only showed a hint to me on puzzle screens, not when I spent ages looking for the last few tiny objects in the general game screens.Despite the art style being pleasant, the game seems to have quite a confusion on what visual theme it wants to pursue - the end result is a haphazard mix of fairytale, steampunk-ish and retro-futuristic elements.Another noticeable thing for me was the lack of ""player character"". There's no body through which a player acts, feeling like I was some invisible disembodied force which still needed lifts and ladders to get to various places, resulting in the weird, empty feeling of both being there and not being there. It was probably one of the reasons why I didn't connect emotionally with the game at all - it felt like a soulless exercise of cookie-cutter charm.Through my playtime the game felt more and more like a chore that I just wanted to be over and done with - then I remembered that games are supposed to be fun, and just dropped it altogether. A disappointment!PS: I recommend to either use a walkthrough, or go play a game with actual charm, character and way less frustrating gameplay, like Botanicula or Samorost.			"

												Never did I think that I am going to repeatedly rage-quit a game like this. It first charmed me with its pretty graphics, enjoyable music, summing up to a cute atosphere alltogether. The first level was in fact fun to play, however as I progressed into the game, I grew more and more frustrated and found myself thinking, ""Is the game challenging, or am I just challenged?"".The game is based on three elements: 1. Finding hidden items that help you get to proper puzzles.  You do have to be very observant to find the clues. What I found annoying was that you cannot collect all of the items beforehand, only upon discovering a puzzle that requires certain things to work.  2. Proper puzzles/minigames.  Some are genuinely interesting and fun to play, although the code to cracking them could be discovered in another way than just clicking the help button. But beware the flickin' arcade games with horrible controls (after all, it's a point and click game!) 3. Putting puzzle pieces together.  Boring and frustrating, with all the pieces having the same shape.The game gets rather dull when you are forced to repeat exactly the same actions all over again with little varation between them. It is also easy to get frustrated while searching for objects, and the clue system can get annoying too.I imagine it could be better to play the game on the tablet than a computer. I'm definately glad I bought it on sale, because the PC gameplay is rather nightmare-ish.			"

												This is a hidden-item game where you can move between various screens and find simple puzzles that require you to collect clickable items from around the place. Your ultimate goal appears to be finding puzzle pieces and a way to exit the area so that you can put the title screen back together.I'd maybe buy this for my mom on mobile, but I myself don't really want to play it anymore.

												I paid $1USD for this game, and even at that price I still cannot recommed buying it. There are three basic aspects to this game; a jigsaw puzzel, hidden objects, and a number of puzzle games.Basically, you find hidden objects to unlock various puzzle games which unlock more areas for you to finish collecting the hidden objects you need to pass the level. The various puzzle games aren't bad, and in fact some of them are pretty good; however I still had a number of issues with the game play.There are two types of hidden objects. Pieces to the jigsaw puzzle that you work on between levels and objects required to unlock the puzzle games or additional areas within a level. Finding the puzzle pieces can present a nice challenge, but the objects related to the mini games are beyond easy to find. The problem with this is that the puzzle peices are completely unnecessary. Whether you find one or all 25, you are given every piece from that level when working on the jigsaw puzzle between rounds. The game doesn't even keep track of how many pieces you have missed nor does missing pieces create gaps in the jigsaw puzzle, which would not only add to the challenge but also give the player some motivation to find all of the puzzle pieces. I also had issues with the jigsaw itself. Basically, every piece of the puzzle was identical in shape and all you had to do was assemble the pieces on top of a to-scale photo of the puzzle. Even the sky/background pieces offered no challenge what-so-ever.I also found the lack of direction in this game to be a bit of a problem. The description states that there is no text, but there isn't even the tiniest bit of instruction when beginning a mini-game without clicking on the 'hint'. Playing through a second time, I've noticed that some of the hints are simply instructions for the game, while others are actual hints (Which I wanted to avoid using). This was a problem because at the beginning of each game, I found myself clicking around the puzzle a few times in order to see how the controls worked, and on at least two occasions my random clicking actually solved the puzzle before I even had a chance to actually begin. This lack of instruction also meant that the greatest challenge for some puzzles was actually figuring out what you needed to do as opposed to trying to solve the puzzle. Again, there were at least three or four puzzles that were both challenging and fullfilling.The ending is beyond unfulfilling. After reaching the final screen, there is no ""the end"", ""you won"", ""congradulations"", nothing. You have an oppertunity to replay any of the mini puzzzles that you faced throughout the game, and after collecting enough bugs for a 'hint', the game indicated that I needed to play them. I only did so thinking that this was one final challenge before beating the game. I was wrong.After beating the mini-puzzles a second time, I started a second game since I had missed a few of the puzzle pieces the first time around. I would have kept looking for them, but if you click on the last object of the level you are forced to move on even if you haven't found all of the puzzle pieces. I was hoping that finding all of the puzzle pieces would earn me some sort of ending. I was wrong. One play through lasts 90-120 minutes which actually makes this the most expensive game playtime/$ of any that I have ever bought on Steam; even after counting the second playthrough etc. I only got 4hours from the game, the rest was just runtime while I was away from the computer.What really prevents me from recommending this game is the description. The store page talks about putting the tiny planet back together and helping the inhabitants etc., but there is no story in this game. Putting the planet back together involves the jigsaw puzzle which was unfulfilling at best, and helping the inhabitants means that there is a person somewhere on each level. Clicking on the person reveals their desire (that you solve a certain minigame) before they'll give you a key or one of the hidden objects you seek, but never once did I feel like I was helping them or even that they had any sort of personality whatsoever.Ultimately this game was unfinished. What starts out as a cute puzzle game quickly turns boring and repetitive in less than an hour. Also, considering the amount of content, this game is grossly overpriced even at $1USD.2/10			"

												Pixel Hunting: The GameThe title is downright lying, the game has no story at all. Basically it's just about 20 hidden object scenes with an occasional minigame. However the objects are often tiny and sometimes almost invisible, so the search gets really frustrating sometimes. Also the hint button doesn't recharge by itself, you have to collect flies which is a bit annoying. The ending is anything but satisfying - there is virtually no ending at all, it's just a screen with buttons to replay the minigames.The graphics are nice though.P.S.: Especially not recommended to color blind people. You won't be able to solve at least two minigames.			"

												The art style is really nice and the music is relaxing, but in the end I've found the actual gameplay frustrating. The two main aspects to the game are puzzles, some of which are fairly clever, others of which are annoying and feel like busywork, and item gathering. The latter is, somewhat vexing and the hint system often points things out that you weren't looking for. The hint system itself is designed to be annoying to discourage casual use, but often you'll need to use it several times in a row to get what you want. To me, the game wore out its welcome while also feeling too short. At the end you get a chance to replay any puzzle you want for fun, but I honestly didn't feel like repeating maybe one or two. It might be worthwhile if it's your thing and if you can snag it at a bargain, but ultimately I can't really recommend buying this game.			"

												Have you ever read an ""I Spy"" book before? This whole game is basically that. You have to spot out puzzle pieces and various objects in the background in order to restore parts of the world and solve puzzles. Some puzzles range from simple to unnecessarily difficult and so do the objects you need to locate, however if you collect enough mosquitoes, the game will tell you where a pick-up-able item is on the screen, so there's that. I'd reccomend this game if you catch it for 99 cents, (which it seems to give out a lot of coupons so that should be easy) and you need something to challenge your brain for an hour or so.

The Tiny Bang Story is a neat but ultimately incomplete and disappointing game. Pros:-Great music and atmosphereCons:-Gameplay has its moments but is generally mediocre and feels unrewarding-No level select screen or way to return to previous levels-No ending-The game does not respect its own premise(see below)The Tiny Bang Story starts off strong, with the music and art coming together to create a delightful fairy-tale atmoshere. Quickly though, the shiny aesthetic wears off to reveal a disappointing core game. The first level feels like it had by far the most effort put into it-perhaps to entice people with a nice demo?The gameplay is roughly a 50/50 split between Where's Waldo-esque collection quests and simple logic puzzles. The logic puzzles range from decent to mediocre, with the mediocre ones lacking any way of achieving a solution other than brute force guessing or using a guide. One problem is that it is sometimes unclear what the player has achieved in the world by completing a puzzle. Several times I found myself looking around, trying to figure what had changed in the world as a result of finishing a puzzle. This greatly diminished the satisfaction of completing the puzzle.The game's biggest flaw, though, lies in its lack of respect for its own premise. The game is divided into five levels, each containing 25 puzzle pieces that, ostensibly, you are supposed to collect in order to repiar the fractured world. On the third level, I neglected to collect several of the puzzle pieces before activating the end-of-level sequence. I was dismayed to discover that not only was there no way to return to the level to collect the rest of the pieces, but the game had progressed as if I had collected them all anyway. This was quite disappointing considering that collecting these pieces has been presented in the opening as the main goal of the game.Due to this severe problem, combined with the lack of an ending and rampant use of the filler collection quests in a pretty short game, I cannot recommend The Tiny Bang Story. I think you can do a lot better in the adventure genre.			"

												This is a cute little hidden object game, although a bit short. It has nice art style and good music, but lacks instructions on what to do next. The puzzles aren't too challenging but some of the items can be hard to spot. Or maybe that's just me... I think this game could have been better with a story to it, but other than that, I think this game was quite fun to play. If you're looking for a relaxing, slow-paced game to play, I definitely recommend that you buy this one during a sale.			"

So then I tried to paly again and this time when it hung I found my entire profile deleted. An exercise in frustration. It seems like a good game, just not stable.			"

The puzzles are challenging, and the visuals are engaging, but it boils down to a simple point and click game, with no story line to speak of and not enough challenge.

												This is a short relaxing point and click game. I found myself getting deeply involved in hunting for puzzle pieces and tiny clues. This is a good way to pass a few hours. In total It took about 4.5 hours to play from start to finish. Some of the puzzles were easily completed, but others were a bit challenging. There isn't any text throughout the game. The art is well done and I found the music to be a great fit for the mood of this game. The story line isn't necessarily deep or involved, there is no mention of the meteor that destroyed the Tiny Planet anywhere in game. Overall, it's a good way to pass the time and it contains interesting puzzles.			"

												This game is perfect to turn of your mind for a while. It takes the genre of ""puzzle game"" way too literally. Gameplay is very simple, involving clicking around several screens per level collecting parts of the next puzzle to solve. Solving these will grant you - you guessed it - pieces to the next puzzle. It can get rather monotonous after a while, and it is clear that this game is in the style of a child's ""I Spy"" type of game, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be appreciated for what it is.The art style is something I've rarely seen and the music is beautiful. After a while of playing, it leaves you in a sort of trance and you just want to habitually keep clicking things, seeing what the next screen will look like. The artsy nature of this game is definitely a bold choice, and I think it was a wise one.			"

I also like that they didn't squeeze some kind of stupid story into this game and you just sort of walk around in this beautiful world. So why the negative review? MINIGAMES! Jesus f%&§?&% Christ, who the hell thought this was a good idea? You have to play these awful arcade minigames to move along in this world and most of them are only annoying and frustrating. Believe it or not, if I want to play a HOG I actually want to play a HOG and I certainly don't want to play a Gameboy-Minigame simulator. It really rips you out of the relaxing atmosphere and destroys all the fun (for me).			"

Enough time was left in between playthroughs that I was still left hunting for everything, and I really, really enjoyed it. This game is not overly challenging and the entire playthrough took me about 3 hours, but for the price of the game it is wonderful. The art is stunning, the point-and-click and puzzle aspect is on point (no pun intended) and it has one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard in a video game.

												First Impressions: Decent puzzle/hidden object game (really more hidden object than puzzle). Charming art style evocative of the masterful Amanita games like Machinarium and Samorost. Where this game differs from Amanita titles is its level of tedium. It's not quite all the way to boring, but it's not particularly exciting either, even within the context of a puzzle/HO game.Good for when you have an hour or two to kill. Even with the $5 price tag, may be worth waiting for a sale before grabbing it.7/10			"

												A pleasant little game with various different puzzles, I loved how each puzzle was somehow linked to the other puzzles in the level, but was a tad disappointed with how short the game was. The game flowed wonderfully together, with soothing music and loved design of it. Would defintitely recommend it to others.			"

												I would like to say that I got this game on sale. It was a good game for the sale price ($0.49) It is very short, the longest part of it is a few of the minigames. However, it only took me a little over 3 hours to beat. The graphics were enjoyable. It reminded me of like a childrens story book. It is mostly a hidden object game, however the minigames vary. It also has an aspect where you fit pieces together, like a puzzle. I liked the music, it was up beat and positive. I say, ""Get it while on sale unless you do not like hidden object games."" (The only reason it is not worth 5 dollars is because of how short it is.) It is also a good game for children to play.			"

												This is a hidden object, point and click game with some puzzles. It is a short game, but the graphics and sound are wonderful. For the sale price that I bought it at (which was $0.49), it was well worth the price. Even so, the regular price, it's still worth a try if you're a fan of hidden object/point and click games. Note; (at the time of this review) you cannot window this game, though there is an option to do so. Also, the puzzle pieces are a nice bonus puzzle, however, upon completing the game, I managed to complete the world puzzle. Even though I had missed three puzzle pieces during my gameplay. So, it seems a little pointless to even search for them (though I did enjoy looking for them ;P ). I would like to see some option of replaying levels and some actual penalty for missing puzzle pieces. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game!			"

												After 2.4hrs of this game, I've not quite gotten bored of it yet. Though not sure why as it's simply a cross between a point n click and a hidden object game. I think it's the unfurling of the various mechanics of the backgrounds that holds a nice small sense of wonder. It's not inoffensive, though it reminds me of mobile games (and it is indeed available on touch screen devices I believe), which I normally don't like appearing on PC.I'm glad I didnt pay the full asking price, but if you can get it on sale, it's worth a look.

												This game is more infuriating then an I Spy book.  The items are hidden in places that will make you question the sanity of the developer for placing them there.

												Positives :1- Its very cute and charming2- The music is relaxing3- Puzzles can be interesting in a passtime wayNegatives1- Too many hidden object goals, with some being utterly camouflaged and/or incredibly tiny. These are required.2- Jigsaw puzzles are long, annoying and frustating. On top of it, the music decided to stop so I quit.3- The hint system is dumb - you have to click flies over and over and over and over... why? just... why?4- Complete lack of story. 5- Perfect for an iPad ; for the kids to have a clickfest and look for the things together while in the car. On PC though, it just doesn't work - besides theres much more fun things to play.Play Machinarium instead. This isn't even worth the dollar, even less your precious time, UNLESS you have kids that love silly puzzles.			"

												I'm not entirely sure what the actual ""story"" is here. Mind you, I'm only partway through this game but so far it has been uninteresting and slightly weird. Don't get me wrong. I like weird and quirky games but this seems to lack focus and charm. The mini arcade games are insanely frustrating. For one thing they are very long and if you make one error you have to start over. If I wanted to play this kind of game I'd hook up my Atari 2600. And, maybe it is just me, but the hint system using flies (or gnats, mosquitos?) kinda icks me out. The only good thing I can say right now is that the soundtrack is pleasant and I didn't pay full price for this game. It was on sale for about $2.50.			"

												I haven't been so simultaneously frustrated and entertained while playing a game in a long time. I really enjoyed this game and the immense satisfaction from completing each increasingly difficult puzzle was addictive. I'm not sure how much replay value the game has, I only just recently completed it and don't want to remember the puzzles too easily when playing again, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good brain teaser.The graphics were beautiful and somehow nostalgic and despite wanting to rip my hair out on a few occasions the music was pleasant and relaxing. Really a very enjoyable experience overall.			"

												The Tiny Bang Story is a cute little puzzle game. The planet broke into hundred pieces after it bumped into a meteorite. You have to find those jigsaw pieces and a whole lot more such as light bulbs, marbles, dice, handles and keys.Basically it's an hidden object game which I'm not a big fan of, but this game really shines in it's own unique way. The graphics are and animations are beautiful and the music brings you in a relaxing mood.A lot of objects are easy to find, and there are a few which are a real pain to find. But finally, when you do find them it gives you a great feeling of satisfaction. The difficulty of the puzzles per se are going from easy to annoying such as the radar or the map with the two planets. But if your stuck you can always collect blue flies by clicking on it. When you've cought enough, they'll give you a hint. Cool game to kill a few hours.7/10			"

												I liked this game and I'm giving it a thumbs up, but i do so with a few big caveats...-There is a puzzle (possibly more than one) you'll be unable to complete if you're colourblind and you'll be unable to progress.-There are two 2-D sidescrolling minigames which you must complete in order to progress. Honestly they have no business being in a point and click/hidden item game like this. I was able to do them but it sucks having a mini-zero-margin-of-error-game in the middle of an otherwise slowpaced and calm game.-it's very short.okay if none of that scared you off the art is really cute and the music is good. It really creates a cohesive game in that respect. The puzzles are simple, but not overly easy. It wont suck up a whole lot of time...i enjoyed playing it over the course of a few days.

The core gameplay is, unsurprisingly, searching the environment for bits to solve puzzles with, then solving little puzzle minigames. There is no story, and while the style is decent enough, there's really very little reason to care about this game - it is pure gameplay, and the gameplay just isn't very gripping, as all it is is basically ""find the objects hidden in plain sight"".

												Checked this out because of the positive rating only to find this game to be unnecessarily frustrating and simply not fun. Many other games in this genre do it way better. It's not a ""bad"" game per se, but it's not worth the time spent playing it.			"

												I got this game because I got a coupon for it, and it was a great decision to buy it. It is a very cute, simple adventure game that will keep you occupied for a few hours. Adorable art-style, intriguing gameplay, a definite must-have in your steam library. And so cheap too! Just get it already.And plus it has Steam trading cards.I like badges.			"

												(9/10)Cute little 'find and click' puzzler.  The art style is somewhat reminiscent of machinarium but the overall puzzles are little simpler with more of a 'find all of thing x' vibe.  Overall very cute and enjoyable.  There is a built in hint system as well if you should get too stuck but you don't need to use it if you do not want to.			"

												Very cute and beatiful game. If you like quests and hidden object games - you should like this one (:In this game you'll find different puzzles, they aren't too hard, but some of them are really hard. At least for me (:Recommended. ---Очень милая и красивая игра. Если вам нравятся квесты и поиск предметов - она должна вам понравиться (:В игре много разных головоломок, в основном они не очень сложные, но некоторые весьма.

												It's charming, quaint, and relaxing, but overall I can't recommend it. For me, the worst aspect was the hint system. If you get stuck and need a hint (and you probably will), you have to stop what you're doing and click on these flies that buzz in from offscreen. It takes a good minute or two to fill up the hint meter, and when you need another hint you have to repeat the process. It would have been better if the meter gradually filled on its own, or if items collected gave you some meter. But if you try to use the hint and the object you need isn't visible on the screen (hidden behind a door), the hint won't activate. It's useful for not wasting hints on screens where there are no items, but I got stuck when the item I needed was behind a window that had to be opened by clicking on a tiny lever half the screen away. No hints for that, just frustrated spam-clicking.After that, there's the puzzles. Most of them are super easy: some even tell you the answer in the hint. But lots of them rely on color recognition, a big no-no in game design. There are no options for color-blindness.Finally, scattered throughout each chapter are puzzle pieces which are used to rebuild the world. But you don't actually need to collect all of the pieces to finish a level, or even the game. I was missing two pieces on the final level, and it just ended. Then I suddenly had all of them to finish the big puzzle. Then the game just ended. Just like that. There was no fanfare, no ""You did it!"" The game just ended and you get to replay puzzles.The game has its good points, but overall I was disappointed. A good timekiller, but not a well-made one.			"

												Positives :1- Its very cute and charming2- The music is relaxing3- Puzzles can be interesting in a passtime wayNegatives1- Too many hidden object goals, with some being utterly camouflaged and/or incredibly tiny. These are required.2- Jigsaw puzzles are long, annoying and frustating. On top of it, the music decided to stop so I quit.3- The hint system is dumb - you have to click flies over and over and over and over... why? just... why?4- Complete lack of story. 5- Perfect for an iPad ; for the kids to have a clickfest and look for the things together while in the car. On PC though, it just doesn't work - besides theres much more fun things to play.Play Machinarium instead. This isn't even worth the dollar, even less your precious time, UNLESS you have kids that love silly puzzles.			"

												I finished this game in one sitting, so it wuld be facetious of me to say I don't recommend it. It has two large flaws, however: One, the minigames where you play some retro arcade-style avoid the obstacles/walls things  are horrible, each took me several frustracting attempts and are not fun and very irritating. They are entirely unlike the other puzzles in the game which are more cerebral and less... stupid. I wish they could be skipped. That being said there are only two of them, but they almost made me give up on the game.Two, the transition between stages is really really bad. You have to collect all these puzzle pieces, and I was going to commend the game for designing it so that I had actually already found all the puzzle pieces before I completed the level and didn't need to spend time scouring for them (there's enough of that in the game anyway) but it turns out you don't actually need to find them all; for the 3rd stage I progressed without having all the puzzle pieces. Either way, you have to do this jigsaw of the world between stages, and it's frankly, awful filler. Jigsaw games exist, and I wnjoy them, but what sets this one apart and brings it to a transendant level of awfulness is that maybe 20% of the pieces are sky, and while that's fine, sky has some texture to it... nope, the puzzle pieces are rendered with bloom on them that makes it impossible to read any subtle indicators. To make the complaints of the transitions sucking a triqueta, I should also point out that the game locks up for a few seconds between stages, making me worried it will crash before I can put the puzzle pieces together.I quite literally got a headache playing this, but for this kind of game that's quite ordinary, and like all games of this kind you need a walk through open in the background, but I found I only refered to it a few times for the more obnoxious puzzles and teeny tiny collectables. Y'know, to get the game finished in one sitting without my head exploding. I neededn't have worried so much, because it actually saves mid-level, but this isn't advertised anywhere, so I assumed that, like a lot of games of this genre, it didn't, and I was always too caught up in it all to test.The ending is deeply unsatisfying, OR it glitched and I missed it. No explanation was given about who the sinister chubby blonde kid is, apart from ""probably a toff"".			"

												I played this game a long time ago and absolutely adored it. A few years later, I have just played it through again and was not disappointed. Enough time was left in between playthroughs that I was still left hunting for everything, and I really, really enjoyed it. This game is not overly challenging and the entire playthrough took me about 3 hours, but for the price of the game it is wonderful. The art is stunning, the point-and-click and puzzle aspect is on point (no pun intended) and it has one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard in a video game. Overall this is a very pleasant game to play.For the enjoyment I got out of this game on both full playthroughs, I give it a solid 10/10.			"

												I've been missing on some good quest/adventure games recently so I decided to boot up a recently won The Tiny Bang Story to see what it has to offer. The game is set on the tiny planet, shattered into many puzzle pieces which you'll have to collect. Basically, the gameplay process looks like that: you reach a new stage and you have to solve a chain of puzzles to proceed further into the game. Each stage contains a certain number of hiden puzzle pieces to collect and a couple of mechanisms to get working again. To repair them, you'll have to search the area for the specified tools or components. Sometimes you have to assemble a jigsaw puzzle, a broken picture and so forth.+: Nice cartoonish graphics, a bunch of enjoyable puzzles, immersing soundtrack, doesn't seem overlong-: Pixel hunting, lack of tutorial, repetitive puzzles			"

If there is a story, I didn't see it; however, the art and sound were great, the puzzles were all fairly easy and enjoyable (aside from 3), and I think they did a great job with the hint system (you technically have unlimited hints but it takes awhile to build them up so you're not tempted to use them at every minor roadblock).I'd say definitely pick it up on sale; you'll get your money's worth and you won't have to invest a ton of time beating the game.

I'd rate it above average for anyone who's nostalgic for that windows 95 search and click puzzle experience.  That art is superb, the music is soothing, and the the puzzles are enough to entertain you for a bit.  However, you will get stuck and a few of the puzzles just don't have good explanations or hints on what to do.  Also the character you're searching is a disappointing lardo you'd want to avoid in real life if you're biased against fat people.  If you're not, he's just a disappointing hardworking entrepreneur that doesn't really give you a satisfying ending.			"

												This is a very short game, but entertaining enough for the price.  The art is very pretty and the puzzles had a lot of variety; my only quibble is that there is not a skip option for puzzles.  For someone like me, who likes certain types of puzzles and completely abhors others, it's grating to have to struggle through the irritating ones.The bulk of the game, aside from the minigame puzzles, is ""hidden-object"" style with a set number of puzzle pieces in each level, along with a variety of other objects to find to complete objectives (i.e. finding all the mail packages to load on a plane before you can take off).  The hidden items are legitimately challenging; the puzzle pieces especially blend in very well to the backdrop and that's a refreshing change from the typical ""here's a pile of junk, find stuff in it"" style of HO games.With the length of the game, I'm not sure if it's worth the full price, but I did find it enjoyable.  If you like HO games and puzzlers, you'll probably like this one; you'll have to decide whether or not to wait for a sale!			"

												I purchased this game for the artwork; the screenshots sold me immediately. I was pleasantly surprised when this point and click game actually provided an immersive story as well. The puzzles and mini-games are challenging enough to provide entertainment for however you play (some people might enjoy rushing through while others might take their time). The only downfall is there isn't a lot of replayability with this game (akin to other point and click games), and it was over all too soon. However, I could tell this game was well designed and the developer/publisher wanted to create something special for their audience. Add in the minimal cost of the game and there really are no negatives worth mentioning. I wouldn't mind another game of this type with the same artwork, but perhaps a different adventure.			"

												Got this on sale for fifty cents.  Best entertainment pennies I have spent recently.  This game is a low key, play at your own pace time waster.  I played at work and had no problem walking away while helping customers and picking back up where I left off.  If you played and liked Machinarium, you will like this.  It's very similiar in playstyle.  6/10			"

												Fun games...and its starts right away after the intro.Of course when you click the Start Game first....you'll first could be clueless of what to do but there is still guides as icons shows up of what you should do and keep doing.You'll need to find hidden stuff to go trough next level.And to do this,you also have puzzles or challenges to fulfill to open up a new area from that level.If you drawn to no point of what you are doing or stuck somewhere somehow,you'll have the flies to help you.Just click on them one by one untill the question mark options up to the right or hint menu filled up.The red fly(the flies you clicks are blue) will show you one hint for what you should be found.Its an exciting games and mind thinking also.Truely are recommended.But,it is unrepeatable...you need to create a new profile to start over.

												There's only one con - I wish it was a little bit longer. It's a perfect casual puzzle mixed with 'find the item' gameplay. Calm music, awesome art & setting. It's simple (other than few puzzles, like a tetris one), relaxing and very enjoyable.			"

												It took me awhile to figure out how the puzzles work, since this game works a little bit different than the puzzle games I've played before. Basicly, you're staring at the screen and click everything you think could help you getting further.. there is no main character who 'guides' you.But after I figured it out, it was indeed a pleasure, although a little bit short for my taste but worth every penny.Non than less, great artwork, nice background music and neat puzzles.

												I finished this game in one sitting, so it wuld be facetious of me to say I don't recommend it. It has two large flaws, however: One, the minigames where you play some retro arcade-style avoid the obstacles/walls things  are horrible, each took me several frustracting attempts and are not fun and very irritating. They are entirely unlike the other puzzles in the game which are more cerebral and less... stupid. I wish they could be skipped. That being said there are only two of them, but they almost made me give up on the game.Two, the transition between stages is really really bad. You have to collect all these puzzle pieces, and I was going to commend the game for designing it so that I had actually already found all the puzzle pieces before I completed the level and didn't need to spend time scouring for them (there's enough of that in the game anyway) but it turns out you don't actually need to find them all; for the 3rd stage I progressed without having all the puzzle pieces. Either way, you have to do this jigsaw of the world between stages, and it's frankly, awful filler. Jigsaw games exist, and I wnjoy them, but what sets this one apart and brings it to a transendant level of awfulness is that maybe 20% of the pieces are sky, and while that's fine, sky has some texture to it... nope, the puzzle pieces are rendered with bloom on them that makes it impossible to read any subtle indicators. To make the complaints of the transitions sucking a triqueta, I should also point out that the game locks up for a few seconds between stages, making me worried it will crash before I can put the puzzle pieces together.I quite literally got a headache playing this, but for this kind of game that's quite ordinary, and like all games of this kind you need a walk through open in the background, but I found I only refered to it a few times for the more obnoxious puzzles and teeny tiny collectables. Y'know, to get the game finished in one sitting without my head exploding. I neededn't have worried so much, because it actually saves mid-level, but this isn't advertised anywhere, so I assumed that, like a lot of games of this genre, it didn't, and I was always too caught up in it all to test.The ending is deeply unsatisfying, OR it glitched and I missed it. No explanation was given about who the sinister chubby blonde kid is, apart from ""probably a toff"".			"

You look around for hidden objects and encounter puzzles a long the way that you need to solve to find some of your objects.For what I paid for it it is well worth the price. Ive read that it is a very short game so be wary of the price you pay. If you enjoy hidden object games this is a pretty decent game.			"

												This is a hidden object, point and click game with some puzzles. It is a short game, but the graphics and sound are wonderful. For the sale price that I bought it at (which was $0.49), it was well worth the price. Even so, the regular price, it's still worth a try if you're a fan of hidden object/point and click games. Note; (at the time of this review) you cannot window this game, though there is an option to do so. Also, the puzzle pieces are a nice bonus puzzle, however, upon completing the game, I managed to complete the world puzzle. Even though I had missed three puzzle pieces during my gameplay. So, it seems a little pointless to even search for them (though I did enjoy looking for them ;P ). I would like to see some option of replaying levels and some actual penalty for missing puzzle pieces. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game!			"

												I've finished the game, so I'll oblige with a short review: PROS:  Graphics were smooth, with good use of lighting and added dusts of light for atmosphere. Art is also well blended, and the items to look for are easy to spot, even if they seem to to be a tad harder to spot as you progress towards the end. Even without dialogue, when you can notice throughout the game is a basic storyline. I don't want to spoil it, so keep your eyes peeled or cheat and check a walkthrough of this game to figure out the hidden storyline within the game! The music was soothing and relaxing, which is best suited for a laid-back casual game like this.CONS/BUGS: The window containing the list of things you should look for should have been toggleable. A number of times I had to wait for it to close so I could pick up the items on that list.  Useless Hint Orb: From what I'm assuming, the little bug creature syou collect fill an orb on the top right of the player's screen. Filling it up, I supposed, would then reward the player with a helpful tip or hint in getting through the stage with everything found. Well....thing is, when I tried to use it, the thing never worked. I may have sacrificed plenty of bugs to that hint bubble and nothing happened. There is a bug in the end of the final chapter where I found the second to last piece of my puzzle collection behind the hummingbird clock. I would have gone to try and locate the last one, but before I could, the game automatically took me back to the title screen to put the pieces in place. Not sure if a bug, or it was just my computer. I feel doing the tasks handed to us in the game should be accompanied with a litle hint or a normal short notification to the player on what they should be doing in the game at the moment.OVERALLThe game is as its tag says; casual, indie, and its a puzzle. A dang awesome puzzle game with complimenting music and art. I would give this game a 80/100 stars! Definitely a play for fun and relaxation! "

												This was a fun but short point and click adventure game that gave me a kick. Its unique puzzles make it worth while, and, as with most puzzle games, I was stumped a few times. For the genre, it actually is pretty long, so if you have the money to buy this games, I'd suggest that you do.			"

VERDICT Buy (8.0/10)Completion Time: 3-4 HoursQuote: ""If you're looking for a super casual game that's accessible and pretty to look at, this is definitely your cup of tea.""PROS+Beautiful levels+Entertaining puzzle piece searching+Super casual gamingCONS-Frustrating moments-Formula grows repetitive-Replay value is non-existantThis game is the definition of casual. What drew me in initially was the visual style. Every level has an uncanny level of detail, making the experience very pleasing to the eye. Gameplay involves travelling from room to room, solving simple puzzles and searching for puzzle pieces along the way to complete a virtual puzzle that advances you to the next world. It's a simple formula, and probably would start to get boring if the game were any longer, but it works and is engaging while it lasts.There were definitely a couple of downfalls. There were a couple puzzle pieces in levels that were simply impossible for me to find. After long periods of searching every inch of the level, there were instances where I was forced to look up tutorials on YouTube, which really took me out of the experience. Most likely you will experience this once or twice, and maybe you will be more perceverent than I was and succeed, but it will still be frustrating nonetheless. Also, there is no reason to play this game a second time, for you will know the location of the puzzle pieces. There are a couple of minigames that become available upon completion of the main story, but those are only a minor distration.If you're looking for a super casual game that's accessible and pretty to look at, this is definitely your cup of tea.

												My favourite point-and-click, and I've played a lot of them! Beautiful visuals, nice sound design and music (although the music could be a little more varied), fun puzzles and nothing that you won't be able to figure out with a little persistence. The game doesn't really get any more difficult as you go along, which is a shame, but still very enjoyable.			"

												I really can't recommend this game. I can't put my finger on why without sounding petty, but I was just overall disappointed while playing this. Nothing seemed to go as expected, I didn't feel like I was actually accomplishing anything most of the time, and the ending was a letdown to me.I liked some of the puzzles. Some were quite creative! The music and art was nice, too. The hint system was good, most of the time at least. Despite all of this, though, I was unhappy with the game, I'm sad to say. I cannot personally recommend it, but perhaps somebody else will enjoy it despite my pooh-poohing.			"

												Kids 12 and under would really enjoy this game. Being in my upper 20's however, I found the game to be a click click click and click again type of game. It has great artwork, but I found myself getting tired of just looking for things. Some objects blend into the background so well that it is almost impossible to find without the clue help. I would reccommend this game for the younger crowd, but I got it for $1.50 so I can't be to mad about it!			"

												I purchased this game for the artwork; the screenshots sold me immediately. I was pleasantly surprised when this point and click game actually provided an immersive story as well. The puzzles and mini-games are challenging enough to provide entertainment for however you play (some people might enjoy rushing through while others might take their time). The only downfall is there isn't a lot of replayability with this game (akin to other point and click games), and it was over all too soon. However, I could tell this game was well designed and the developer/publisher wanted to create something special for their audience. Add in the minimal cost of the game and there really are no negatives worth mentioning. I wouldn't mind another game of this type with the same artwork, but perhaps a different adventure.			"

												I remember watching a ""WTF is"" of this ages ago and for only $1.25 it was worth trying.  I'd rate it above average for anyone who's nostalgic for that windows 95 search and click puzzle experience.  That art is superb, the music is soothing, and the the puzzles are enough to entertain you for a bit.  However, you will get stuck and a few of the puzzles just don't have good explanations or hints on what to do.  Also the character you're searching is a disappointing lardo you'd want to avoid in real life if you're biased against fat people.  If you're not, he's just a disappointing hardworking entrepreneur that doesn't really give you a satisfying ending.			"

												It's charming, quaint, and relaxing, but overall I can't recommend it. For me, the worst aspect was the hint system. If you get stuck and need a hint (and you probably will), you have to stop what you're doing and click on these flies that buzz in from offscreen. It takes a good minute or two to fill up the hint meter, and when you need another hint you have to repeat the process. It would have been better if the meter gradually filled on its own, or if items collected gave you some meter. But if you try to use the hint and the object you need isn't visible on the screen (hidden behind a door), the hint won't activate. It's useful for not wasting hints on screens where there are no items, but I got stuck when the item I needed was behind a window that had to be opened by clicking on a tiny lever half the screen away. No hints for that, just frustrated spam-clicking.After that, there's the puzzles. Most of them are super easy: some even tell you the answer in the hint. But lots of them rely on color recognition, a big no-no in game design. There are no options for color-blindness.Finally, scattered throughout each chapter are puzzle pieces which are used to rebuild the world. But you don't actually need to collect all of the pieces to finish a level, or even the game. I was missing two pieces on the final level, and it just ended. Then I suddenly had all of them to finish the big puzzle. Then the game just ended. Just like that. There was no fanfare, no ""You did it!"" The game just ended and you get to replay puzzles.The game has its good points, but overall I was disappointed. A good timekiller, but not a well-made one.			"

												Clever puzzle game.  A more polished version of the ""free"" cash cow hidden object and puzzle games on the Apple and Google App Stores.   Just a relaxing game to play including the music and themes.  So far, the puzzles have been acceptable in difficulty.  Not so challenging that the game becomes a chore, and not so easy that I'm bored after ten minutes.    Even my wife loves this game.  It's probably the first game I've ever been able to get her to watch and play on Steam.  Next time it's on sale for $1-$2 you can't go wrong buying this game.  A nice diversion from the heavy-handed shooters, strategy and RPG games that most of us look for first.			"

It's a simple point-and-click puzzle game that has puzzles of varying difficulties but none of them were unsolvable (although some took a little extra time and thought).

												The Tiny Bang Story is cute. It is short and sweet. It does not over extend its welcome but you enjoy the time you had with it. The only downside is that if you want to replay this game you will have to wait a while to forget where everything is to play it again. The game flows nicely together and you there really isn't any dialog which isn't understood by the action. The game is pretty universal and accessible. I recommend this game to Hidden Object fans and children. It made me feel like a kid again reading those old I SPY books.			"

												I've finished the game, so I'll oblige with a short review: PROS:  Graphics were smooth, with good use of lighting and added dusts of light for atmosphere. Art is also well blended, and the items to look for are easy to spot, even if they seem to to be a tad harder to spot as you progress towards the end. Even without dialogue, when you can notice throughout the game is a basic storyline. I don't want to spoil it, so keep your eyes peeled or cheat and check a walkthrough of this game to figure out the hidden storyline within the game! The music was soothing and relaxing, which is best suited for a laid-back casual game like this.CONS/BUGS: The window containing the list of things you should look for should have been toggleable. A number of times I had to wait for it to close so I could pick up the items on that list.  Useless Hint Orb: From what I'm assuming, the little bug creature syou collect fill an orb on the top right of the player's screen. Filling it up, I supposed, would then reward the player with a helpful tip or hint in getting through the stage with everything found. Well....thing is, when I tried to use it, the thing never worked. I may have sacrificed plenty of bugs to that hint bubble and nothing happened. There is a bug in the end of the final chapter where I found the second to last piece of my puzzle collection behind the hummingbird clock. I would have gone to try and locate the last one, but before I could, the game automatically took me back to the title screen to put the pieces in place. Not sure if a bug, or it was just my computer. I feel doing the tasks handed to us in the game should be accompanied with a litle hint or a normal short notification to the player on what they should be doing in the game at the moment.OVERALLThe game is as its tag says; casual, indie, and its a puzzle. A dang awesome puzzle game with complimenting music and art. I would give this game a 80/100 stars! Definitely a play for fun and relaxation! "

												Great game if you're looking for something to unwind with after a long, stressful day.The graphics are cute and easy on the eyes, and the artwork is something you would expect in a decent children's story book, which isn't a bad thing at all in my opinion.The puzzles are not too easy, but they aren't so challenging that you will end up throwing your mouse at the computer screen out frustration.The soundtrack can get a little bit repetitive after awhile, but it's still nice to listen to and fits the overall theme of the game well.If you're looking for a nice relaxing puzzle game with a just a bit of a challenge, I would definitely recommend this one!

												I highly recommend this game for anyone, who just wants to sit back, relax and solve some puzzles.The Game design is absolutely beautiful (what I didnt expect at all, but the style of the drawings is simply awesome) and combined with the background music, it creates a sweet and peaceful atmosphere.I was (and still am) totally stunned, because this game was just what i was looking for - something that gives you a break from very skill heavy and competitive games.Controls are very easy (you only need to left-click things), the game focuses on the puzzle solving, finding items, etc., which gets a little more demanding the further you get.I think it took me about 3hrs to get through - most of the puzzles are rather easy, yet not boring. Some do require some more thinking to solve them; i even got stuck on one of them. Generally, finding the objects/puzzle pieces takes a lot longer though.I bought this for 50 cents or so, which is why I didnt expect much, but as soon as I started, I couldnt stop and completed the game in almost one sitting. (which is sad, i really wanted to solve more stuff haha)When you've read up until here, this shouldn't be a surprise: I loved it!!			"

												This is a very short game, but entertaining enough for the price.  The art is very pretty and the puzzles had a lot of variety; my only quibble is that there is not a skip option for puzzles.  For someone like me, who likes certain types of puzzles and completely abhors others, it's grating to have to struggle through the irritating ones.The bulk of the game, aside from the minigame puzzles, is ""hidden-object"" style with a set number of puzzle pieces in each level, along with a variety of other objects to find to complete objectives (i.e. finding all the mail packages to load on a plane before you can take off).  The hidden items are legitimately challenging; the puzzle pieces especially blend in very well to the backdrop and that's a refreshing change from the typical ""here's a pile of junk, find stuff in it"" style of HO games.With the length of the game, I'm not sure if it's worth the full price, but I did find it enjoyable.  If you like HO games and puzzlers, you'll probably like this one; you'll have to decide whether or not to wait for a sale!			"

												There's a twist.  Although it is advertized as a point-and-click game, there are old fashioned (centipedes-style) minigames embedded. Beware if you hate these. You must pass them to progress. You must use the mouse.  You cannot use the arrow or WASD keys to navigate them. This is my only gripe.  Other than this it is charming and a wonderful break from hack-and-slash.			"

												It's charming, quaint, and relaxing, but overall I can't recommend it. For me, the worst aspect was the hint system. If you get stuck and need a hint (and you probably will), you have to stop what you're doing and click on these flies that buzz in from offscreen. It takes a good minute or two to fill up the hint meter, and when you need another hint you have to repeat the process. It would have been better if the meter gradually filled on its own, or if items collected gave you some meter. But if you try to use the hint and the object you need isn't visible on the screen (hidden behind a door), the hint won't activate. It's useful for not wasting hints on screens where there are no items, but I got stuck when the item I needed was behind a window that had to be opened by clicking on a tiny lever half the screen away. No hints for that, just frustrated spam-clicking.After that, there's the puzzles. Most of them are super easy: some even tell you the answer in the hint. But lots of them rely on color recognition, a big no-no in game design. There are no options for color-blindness.Finally, scattered throughout each chapter are puzzle pieces which are used to rebuild the world. But you don't actually need to collect all of the pieces to finish a level, or even the game. I was missing two pieces on the final level, and it just ended. Then I suddenly had all of them to finish the big puzzle. Then the game just ended. Just like that. There was no fanfare, no ""You did it!"" The game just ended and you get to replay puzzles.The game has its good points, but overall I was disappointed. A good timekiller, but not a well-made one.			"

The music and artwork is gorgeous, but the game itself is a wonderful mix of classic tropes; it mainly focuses on object-finding, puzzles and mini-games, but it combines them in such a way as to ensure that you're always challenged and finding something to do. I've never seen a game get the balance this right before. Added to that how relaxing it feels to play, and you have one of my favourite games. I was sad when I finished it; I wanted more!			"

												I found this game surprisingly relaxing to play, it's not hard or difficult but the comforting music and beautiful artstyle made me go back more than twice. There's no story per se, even if the store page tells about how the Tiny Planet has been smashed into pieces and you have to fix it. I don't see how that's incorporated into the game in any other way than the pieces of puzzle you find throughout the different chapters (and then put them together when finishing a chapter). Some of the puzzles are not easy to solve - not because they're difficult in understanding, but because you either don't understand completely what you're supposed to do or the puzzle itself is extremely sensitive to your mouse's movement (only applies to one puzzle). +Very beautiful artNeat music, it's hypnotizing and relaxingEasy and fun, well worth spending an afternoon withYou really have to scout the screen in order to find every piece you're looking for, and yes, I say that on the plus side. This game deserves not being rushed through, but investigated thoroughly.-Some might find the 8-bits mini games inside the game itself stressful, however they aren't hard but rahter reminds me of the whole ""You only have 1 life to play through the entire game"" mentality that was applied to early NES gamesNo story other than what you imagine yourself, and that might be a downside for some. I like it though. It's rather short, but I still think it's worth the moneyWould I recommend this game? Yeah, if you like point-and-click games with harmless music and don't mind a bit of trial-and-error in order to solve some of the puzzles. I find myself returning to the game when in need of some relaxation or when in a need of cheering up. It's neat and only makes you feel happy when playing it, and that's not a bad thing.			"

												I haven't been so simultaneously frustrated and entertained while playing a game in a long time. I really enjoyed this game and the immense satisfaction from completing each increasingly difficult puzzle was addictive. I'm not sure how much replay value the game has, I only just recently completed it and don't want to remember the puzzles too easily when playing again, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good brain teaser.The graphics were beautiful and somehow nostalgic and despite wanting to rip my hair out on a few occasions the music was pleasant and relaxing. Really a very enjoyable experience overall.			"

												The Tiny Bang Story is a cute little puzzle game. The planet broke into hundred pieces after it bumped into a meteorite. You have to find those jigsaw pieces and a whole lot more such as light bulbs, marbles, dice, handles and keys.Basically it's an hidden object game which I'm not a big fan of, but this game really shines in it's own unique way. The graphics are and animations are beautiful and the music brings you in a relaxing mood.A lot of objects are easy to find, and there are a few which are a real pain to find. But finally, when you do find them it gives you a great feeling of satisfaction. The difficulty of the puzzles per se are going from easy to annoying such as the radar or the map with the two planets. But if your stuck you can always collect blue flies by clicking on it. When you've cought enough, they'll give you a hint. Cool game to kill a few hours.7/10			"

												Positives :1- Its very cute and charming2- The music is relaxing3- Puzzles can be interesting in a passtime wayNegatives1- Too many hidden object goals, with some being utterly camouflaged and/or incredibly tiny. These are required.2- Jigsaw puzzles are long, annoying and frustating. On top of it, the music decided to stop so I quit.3- The hint system is dumb - you have to click flies over and over and over and over... why? just... why?4- Complete lack of story. 5- Perfect for an iPad ; for the kids to have a clickfest and look for the things together while in the car. On PC though, it just doesn't work - besides theres much more fun things to play.Play Machinarium instead. This isn't even worth the dollar, even less your precious time, UNLESS you have kids that love silly puzzles.			"

												This game is awesome EXCEPT for the stupid arcade type games that you have to get through to pass a level.  Puzzles and things that take thought would be much more enjoyable.  The ""space invade"" type games totally ruin the whole game for me.  I guess if you spent a lot of time as a youth playing those types of games you may have acquired some skill, but for me as an older player I find them tedious and unenjoyable.			"

												I've been missing on some good quest/adventure games recently so I decided to boot up a recently won The Tiny Bang Story to see what it has to offer. The game is set on the tiny planet, shattered into many puzzle pieces which you'll have to collect. Basically, the gameplay process looks like that: you reach a new stage and you have to solve a chain of puzzles to proceed further into the game. Each stage contains a certain number of hiden puzzle pieces to collect and a couple of mechanisms to get working again. To repair them, you'll have to search the area for the specified tools or components. Sometimes you have to assemble a jigsaw puzzle, a broken picture and so forth.+: Nice cartoonish graphics, a bunch of enjoyable puzzles, immersing soundtrack, doesn't seem overlong-: Pixel hunting, lack of tutorial, repetitive puzzles			"

												This game is perfect to turn of your mind for a while. It takes the genre of ""puzzle game"" way too literally. Gameplay is very simple, involving clicking around several screens per level collecting parts of the next puzzle to solve. Solving these will grant you - you guessed it - pieces to the next puzzle. It can get rather monotonous after a while, and it is clear that this game is in the style of a child's ""I Spy"" type of game, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be appreciated for what it is.The art style is something I've rarely seen and the music is beautiful. After a while of playing, it leaves you in a sort of trance and you just want to habitually keep clicking things, seeing what the next screen will look like. The artsy nature of this game is definitely a bold choice, and I think it was a wise one.			"

												I finished this game in one sitting, so it wuld be facetious of me to say I don't recommend it. It has two large flaws, however: One, the minigames where you play some retro arcade-style avoid the obstacles/walls things  are horrible, each took me several frustracting attempts and are not fun and very irritating. They are entirely unlike the other puzzles in the game which are more cerebral and less... stupid. I wish they could be skipped. That being said there are only two of them, but they almost made me give up on the game.Two, the transition between stages is really really bad. You have to collect all these puzzle pieces, and I was going to commend the game for designing it so that I had actually already found all the puzzle pieces before I completed the level and didn't need to spend time scouring for them (there's enough of that in the game anyway) but it turns out you don't actually need to find them all; for the 3rd stage I progressed without having all the puzzle pieces. Either way, you have to do this jigsaw of the world between stages, and it's frankly, awful filler. Jigsaw games exist, and I wnjoy them, but what sets this one apart and brings it to a transendant level of awfulness is that maybe 20% of the pieces are sky, and while that's fine, sky has some texture to it... nope, the puzzle pieces are rendered with bloom on them that makes it impossible to read any subtle indicators. To make the complaints of the transitions sucking a triqueta, I should also point out that the game locks up for a few seconds between stages, making me worried it will crash before I can put the puzzle pieces together.I quite literally got a headache playing this, but for this kind of game that's quite ordinary, and like all games of this kind you need a walk through open in the background, but I found I only refered to it a few times for the more obnoxious puzzles and teeny tiny collectables. Y'know, to get the game finished in one sitting without my head exploding. I neededn't have worried so much, because it actually saves mid-level, but this isn't advertised anywhere, so I assumed that, like a lot of games of this genre, it didn't, and I was always too caught up in it all to test.The ending is deeply unsatisfying, OR it glitched and I missed it. No explanation was given about who the sinister chubby blonde kid is, apart from ""probably a toff"".			"

VERDICT Buy (8.0/10)Completion Time: 3-4 HoursQuote: ""If you're looking for a super casual game that's accessible and pretty to look at, this is definitely your cup of tea.""PROS+Beautiful levels+Entertaining puzzle piece searching+Super casual gamingCONS-Frustrating moments-Formula grows repetitive-Replay value is non-existantThis game is the definition of casual. What drew me in initially was the visual style. Every level has an uncanny level of detail, making the experience very pleasing to the eye. Gameplay involves travelling from room to room, solving simple puzzles and searching for puzzle pieces along the way to complete a virtual puzzle that advances you to the next world. It's a simple formula, and probably would start to get boring if the game were any longer, but it works and is engaging while it lasts.There were definitely a couple of downfalls. There were a couple puzzle pieces in levels that were simply impossible for me to find. After long periods of searching every inch of the level, there were instances where I was forced to look up tutorials on YouTube, which really took me out of the experience. Most likely you will experience this once or twice, and maybe you will be more perceverent than I was and succeed, but it will still be frustrating nonetheless. Also, there is no reason to play this game a second time, for you will know the location of the puzzle pieces. There are a couple of minigames that become available upon completion of the main story, but those are only a minor distration.If you're looking for a super casual game that's accessible and pretty to look at, this is definitely your cup of tea.

												I'm generally not the biggest fan of hidden object games, but if the hidden objects serve a sensible purpose, such as being part of an overall puzzle and leading to a variety of in-game puzzles, as they do in The Tiny Bang Story, I am wiling to spend a few hours playing through it.The Tiny Bang Story has a pleasant and charming hand-drawn art style, hidden objects, and a range of mostly very casual puzzles, a few of which I found enjoyably tricky too. A puzzle game with no real challenges can easily get a bit too casual and thus boring.Speaking of art style, I also enjoyed how some objects on the screen react to the mouse pointer, such as cables and lines shifting when you move over them. Quite nice. Though subtle, it makes the scene feel so much more alive.There are in-game hints, with a clever and original time-delay between hints that seem to require a certain number of flies to be clicked on before a new one becomes available. Depending on what section you're in, a hint will either show you something you should be clicking on the screen, or it gives a solution hint to one of the puzzle games. It's simply nicely done.The music is nice, downbeat and in the background, well suited for a game that requires focus such as this one, though it did start feeling a bit repetitive after a while - as music does in most games.There is only one thing missing from this game, and that is decent video options to make it other than its original pixel dimensions. As I sometimes have to do this with older games anyway, it wasn't much bother for me just changing my screen's resolution through the control panel to suit the game.In the end, I think it took me a bit less than 3.5 hour playing through the whole game, though with a few distractions along the way that probably kept me from doing it at optimum efficiency. At its current RRP, I think it is very decent value for money. On sale, or in a bundle, it should be mandatory shopping for anyone who loves puzzle games or even for those who just enjoy the art style. "

												This is a fun little game that is quite enjoyable.THe thing that first drew me to this game was the artwork. I absolutely love the style of the art and every scene is vibrant and as weird as the last. Its very colourful and there is a lot going on but not so much as to make it an eye-sore.The puzzles themselves are lovely and well thought out to make sure that you have to think a bit to get them done. They are neither to easy nor to difficult. This makes the game fun without being frustrating and there is even a nice help feature should you find yourself stuck at any particular part. I would recomend this game to: those enjoy puzzle games; people that are looking for a game that is a break from the fast pased shooters or long RPG's (another reason I bought the game); or those that just enjoy looking at the artwork as they play throught the game.A lovely little game that gave me just over 3 hours of gameplay and for the price I bought it (~ $1) it was  a really good game.

												Off the bat, this is not as good as Machinarium (developed by the same team).That being said, it's a great adventure game with awesome visuals, excelent soundtrack and that zen-feeling that you got used to in Machinarium.Bare in mind that this isn't your usual adventure title. There is no avatar, it's just you, the mouse pointer (that is sort of the main character; it's complicated). Also, you don't exactly solve an adventure as much as you carefully look for items across various rooms. Imagine a MMOAdventureGame. Instead of finding X item once, you have to find it 10 times but it's an absolute requirement to find them.That isn't to say that the actual gameplay is boring, for the less-enthusiastic solver extraordinaire. Most of them are immensely fun, but also fairly standard. Tetris puzzle, pieces in painting puzzle, jigsaw puzzle, pipe puzzle etc.With the help of the hints system, I finished the whole thing it in about 5 hours which, let's be honest here, is a little weak for a game (unless you're milking Call of Duty). Given it's price, however, you can't hold the length too much against it, as the ambiance, the style, the music and everything about it will suck you into a world that says a story only through visuals, yet still does a damn fine job.Think of it more like an excellent flash puzzle game than a classic adventure game and you'll love it. I sure did.			"

												Nice little gem of a game! It is strong combination of searching for hidden objects and using those to unlock challenging, unique puzzles. The Tiny Bang Story has a nice atmosphere with its unique artwork and matching music.After finishing it once I almost immediately started over again. It is addictive and absolutely fun to play!			"

												Much better than average hidden object game - way more depth. Beautifully illustrated as well. A short game, and not very difficult either, although I had to Google the solution to one tricky puzzle (as usual, the answer was right before my eyes). It ends rather abruptly, wish it had slightly more climactic conclusion. Definitely worth a play if you like hidden object games – very relaxing.TIP: be sure to collect all the puzzle pieces of each chapter first. The progression from one chapter to the next can happen quite unexpectedly, leaving you with uncollected puzzle pieces. "

												I really can't recommend this game. I can't put my finger on why without sounding petty, but I was just overall disappointed while playing this. Nothing seemed to go as expected, I didn't feel like I was actually accomplishing anything most of the time, and the ending was a letdown to me.I liked some of the puzzles. Some were quite creative! The music and art was nice, too. The hint system was good, most of the time at least. Despite all of this, though, I was unhappy with the game, I'm sad to say. I cannot personally recommend it, but perhaps somebody else will enjoy it despite my pooh-poohing.			"

I played it twice, the atmosphere is very relaxing.Difficulty : 3/5.There are hidden objects, which fade very well into the blackground, and the puzzles are diversified.Some puzzles need reflection, and I was stuck only once, with the pipe puzzle.However, there is no story, so I think one cannot compare this game to machinarium for example.

												Kids 12 and under would really enjoy this game. Being in my upper 20's however, I found the game to be a click click click and click again type of game. It has great artwork, but I found myself getting tired of just looking for things. Some objects blend into the background so well that it is almost impossible to find without the clue help. I would reccommend this game for the younger crowd, but I got it for $1.50 so I can't be to mad about it!			"

 The Tiny Bang story is a relaxing find-and-puzzle game, the graphical style, the music and the overal gameplay are very peaceful and cozy, although the game succeeds in frustrating the player in many of the unskippable minigames. Gameplay:The main gameplay element is finding items hidden within the scenary, items like lightbulbs, vents, puzzelpieces... Because these items are in most cases really well blended with the environment there is a help system, click enough mosquitoes  and they will show you where 1 hidden items is within the scene. This is a nice little help system because they force the player to look at the scene while trying to catch them, often finding the hidden item before actually using the clue. They also hold the player back from using hints all the time, because you need quite alot of them for one clue instead of filling over time like most help systems in game do.Minigames:There are quite alot of minigames within this game, 20 to be exact. Most of them are very relaxing and don't require any help, but there are a few ennoying ones where you really have to try and try to eventually solve them. These minigames never have any hints except for a paper with a drawing on it trying to explain what you have to do without using any text, and for most of them that is enough. But it would be nice to get a little bit of extra help on the difficult puzzels.Story:Although there is no player character and thus no real story, you do learn alot about the world and it's inhabitants through it's scenary. Graphics:As you can see in the screenshots of the game, the graphics consist of a very stylisch 2D side view of the world. The graphics are well done and are very fitting for the game and atmostphere. Sound:The background music is relaxing and suited the game well. Though the soundeffects of the mosquitoes did ennoy me after some while. There are no dialogues in the game, so I can't say anything about voice overs.Conclusion:Though it's a very short game to play through, it's definitely worth playing if you like more relaxing and calm puzzle games. It's a nice change of pace between all the other games, and a real candy for the eye. So I recommend it to anyone who can enjoy a more relaxing puzzle game.			"

												This is a very short game, but entertaining enough for the price.  The art is very pretty and the puzzles had a lot of variety; my only quibble is that there is not a skip option for puzzles.  For someone like me, who likes certain types of puzzles and completely abhors others, it's grating to have to struggle through the irritating ones.The bulk of the game, aside from the minigame puzzles, is ""hidden-object"" style with a set number of puzzle pieces in each level, along with a variety of other objects to find to complete objectives (i.e. finding all the mail packages to load on a plane before you can take off).  The hidden items are legitimately challenging; the puzzle pieces especially blend in very well to the backdrop and that's a refreshing change from the typical ""here's a pile of junk, find stuff in it"" style of HO games.With the length of the game, I'm not sure if it's worth the full price, but I did find it enjoyable.  If you like HO games and puzzlers, you'll probably like this one; you'll have to decide whether or not to wait for a sale!			"

There is a small bug that happens in the middle of the game that will cause a 2 to 3 minute lag with in windowed mode, from the game accepting your world view puzzle as being finished for the chapter.

												Superb HOG/puzzle game, though some of the puzzles are a bit too obscure to figure out for a ""normal""-""casual"" gamer. I honestly have no idea how some of the makers of walkthroughs for this came to solve some of these... But it's just a testament to how different peoples brains work and are wired, and I am grateful they did take the time to post their solutions because I'd never make it if they didn't. Apart from those couple of instances, it's a really pleasant game with cute music and art work.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this Hidden Object game. The graphics and soundtrack were absolutely pleasing and the game play challenging, yet not impossible to manage. I enjoyed the fluctuating array of puzzles, as well as the option to utilize hints if necessary. A few of the puzzles were difficult, but it was a nice even blend .  Overall Rating - 9.5/10I'd give it a 10/10, but it was a bit on the short side. Even 2 more chapters added to the original story would be nice, but overall I'd highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a relaxing PoC. I also agree with others who have stated achievements would be a very nice addition (I'd even play through again if the Devs wanted to add some) as well as a second installment to this beautifully charming game. ^^			"

												I had never played a hidden object game before - at least, not in recent times - and seeing as I already owned (and had installed) this game, I figured, why not try it out?As it turns out, this game is pretty meh. The core gameplay is, unsurprisingly, searching the environment for bits to solve puzzles with, then solving little puzzle minigames. There is no story, and while the style is decent enough, there's really very little reason to care about this game - it is pure gameplay, and the gameplay just isn't very gripping, as all it is is basically ""find the objects hidden in plain sight"".

												The Tiny Bang Story is exactly what you would expect. I bought it with a coupon I got from making a badge and I really enjoyed the overall game. The artwork is beautiful and it feels like you are in a sketchbook. The puzzles are not too challenging, its mostly like an ISPY type game with finding items to get to the main puzzle, which in itself is pretty unique. The only bad thing I would have to say about this game is that there is no replayability at all. Once you're done you have no reason to go back to the game, its one of those games where it just follows the story and nothing else. If you like puzzle games I would definitely recommend this game.

												A fun and quick little game, you can finish it in about 5-7 hours. The puzzles aren't so challenging that you have to cheat but just hard enough to make you think.			"

												I really enjoyed this game...I am not sure how I got it so it must have been in a bundle. By chance I clicked and the first opening window I saw the art and was hooked :D  I did try to see if they made any other games but so far it looks like this is the only one..I hope they continue to make more!Thank you!!

												Nice little gem of a game! It is strong combination of searching for hidden objects and using those to unlock challenging, unique puzzles. The Tiny Bang Story has a nice atmosphere with its unique artwork and matching music.After finishing it once I almost immediately started over again. It is addictive and absolutely fun to play!			"

 Adorablly sweet It was nice and short and sweet. The gameplay with all the hidden puzzle pieces and mini games was really fun. I have to admit I really disliked the 8 bit games ""within the game"" but other than that it was quite a nice little game to play for a chill afternoon.			"

												What a fantastic puzzle game! I absolutely loved the music - I could listen to it all day. The looks and atmosphere of this game is beyond charming, Some of the puzzles I really got stuck on! Very unique and there is a replayable factor to it. (Gotta find all of the pieces!!) Well worth the money for about 3 hours of enjoyment. Highly recommended!			"

												I liked this game and I'm giving it a thumbs up, but i do so with a few big caveats...-There is a puzzle (possibly more than one) you'll be unable to complete if you're colourblind and you'll be unable to progress.-There are two 2-D sidescrolling minigames which you must complete in order to progress. Honestly they have no business being in a point and click/hidden item game like this. I was able to do them but it sucks having a mini-zero-margin-of-error-game in the middle of an otherwise slowpaced and calm game.-it's very short.okay if none of that scared you off the art is really cute and the music is good. It really creates a cohesive game in that respect. The puzzles are simple, but not overly easy. It wont suck up a whole lot of time...i enjoyed playing it over the course of a few days. Pick it up when it's on sale.			"

												Cute little game. Lovely aesthetic. I guess as a kid I had a lot of books in the ""hidden object"" genre (""Where's Wally"" and such) so I enjoyed poring over every picture. Obviously not for everyone, but I found it quite relaxing in small bursts, so I'd say it's worth a few bucks.			"

												I don't like hidden object games but this drew me in with it's hand-drawn artwork which is simply gorgeous. The hidden object aspect is well done but some objects can be frustratingly difficult to find because they blend in well with the environment and you overlook them. But it can feel rewarding when they are found so that's good. The puzzles are not too hard except a few maybe. And the soundtrack is absolutely excellent. I especially love the last track, ""Time Stands Still"" which feels very peaceful. I recommend playing the game with headphones. The game is short and can be completed in a couple of hours(depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles) but I would say, take your time and enjoy it. Very nice and relaxing game for a lazy Sunday afternoon.			"

												Relaxing puzzle game. Most of the puzzles are easy to moderate. Sometimes it's annoying to try and hunt down items that you're missing. The developer did a really good job of integrating interactive items into the environment.The ending kinda sucks... assuming that's an ending. I can't tell.			"

												Excellent little puzzle/hidden object game. The art is enjoyable, and there are enough different aspects to the game that it's not going to bore you. I wish there was more interaction between the found objects, but that's a really minor beef.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I love the artwork and the music. The hidden objects are fun to find and most of the puzzles are interesting. (No more ""Simon"" games, please!) I like the fact that there's no language and no writing. And there's no hand holding for figuring out even what the goal of a puzzle is. You have to use your brain. And if you pay close attention, there's even the story of a man's life. I would love to see more games like this.			"

GameplayThe Tiny Bang Story is a point-and-click adventure game, where a meteor blow up the world. It is up to you to put back the puzzle pieces and save the world. All story is the explained by the intro and is never mentioned again. You go through all the chapters and do small puzzles and mini games. There's multiple location in one chapter and you have to complete all the puzzles in the first location before it pans to the next one. All the puzzle in this game is fairly easy, but some quite tedious. For example: Before you can start a new chapter, you have to solve a puzzle piece. It is quite lazy and boring game design. It should not hold you back of an excellent indie game. GraphicsAll graphics in this game is drawn by hand and it is phenomenal beautiful with its light, charming colors and cute art style. It takes everyday objects and scale them big. I am quite amazed how well done and creative the art really is.SoundDefinitely one of my favorite soundtracks ever done. Relaxing music, which suits the whole art style of the game. I can still hear all the soundtracks playing in my head. It is that good! Fantastic music for an indie game, no one has really heard about.VerdictThis is probably my most played point-and-click game. It is really short, but the soundtrack, art style and puzzles are enough go back. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves these types of games.			"

												Ok so I do like this game but I watched some of the glitches happen to me (luckly) on none crushal puzzles. It happened to me on puzzle pieces. I would find a puzzle piece and the counter just didn't count it, but it still counted in the game. Maddinng if you don't know that it will still count as found when the side bar says your missing one. Also kept crashing on me the closer I got to the end, perhaps about 6 times in the last level. At the end of the game I had all the puzzle peices to finish the game. I wouldn't pay full price at all. But I don't regreat my perchase at 80% off. Its a little hard to get into if this is your first of even third hidden objects game but you get the idea of the game by about level 2. Short, nice to look at, Probably not as hard as other hidden objects games but relaxing. Keep in mind the gliche I mentioned and you'll be fine. But for its age and people mentioning the same but as I have, they have not fixed it. So I won't buy anything from the Dev again unless I don't realize what I've done until its too late.			"

Each element of the world responds in a slick, responsive way, for a modern and refined feel.GraphicsBeautiful art drives the entire experience, with varied and fascinatingly detailed worlds rewarding each step forward. Truly memorable, prepare to be lost in this game's dreamlike wonder.SoundNostalgic, relaxing and mesmerising music throughout, perfectly capturing the feel of the world. High quality sound effects also give weight to the experience.ConclusionIf you are looking for a solid point and click adventure, puzzle, or relaxing game then this is highly recommended. If you appreciate quality art and music in video games, then this game is a must buy.			"
