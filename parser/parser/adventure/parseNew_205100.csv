AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Dishonored Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Stealth; Atmospheric; First-Person; Dark; RPG; Action My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-40 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates REVIEWDishonored is a riveting, immersive, and downright pleasurable experience.  Decent graphics with superb artistic direction and a fitting soundtrack set the ambiance.  There is a captivating world to explore, rife with a subtle-but-present wealth of lore and history.  The gameplay can range from stealthy-pacifist style to murderous-warrior style, or somewhere in between; it is easy to find a playstyle that suits your preferences.  There is much to like.The atmosphere of the game is really its heart and soul.  The gameworld is masterfully crafted to be immersive and intriguing as you explore your way through the campaign.  Wandering through side passages and windows, you not only find collectibles and items but also notes and books which provide lore and background information.  This supplements the primary storyline and few sidequests that compose the main narrative.  That narrative being enticing and well-told, although not without a few clichés.The gameplay is structured to offer varying, branching options to choose from as you progress toward your goal.  In each level, there are various paths to take and various ways to take them. You could blow open the front door and slaughter everyone or you can slip through an attic window and never allow your presence to be known.  A lot of games try to offer this, but Dishonored is exceptional in how balanced the gameplay is to truly allow for both stealth and loud options.  It does lean slightly toward stealth, undoubtedly, but you really have a lot of freedom to get creative in how you want to go about each mission.Another premiere aspect of the game, tying together the atmosphere and gameplay, is the evolving gameworld.  Depending on your methods of completing earlier missions, as you get deeper into the campaign the gameworld changes to reflect how your actions have impacted society.  The effects are ultimately rather subtle, but contribute to further highlight the outstanding atmosphere of the game.The various styles of play and mission paths combined with achievements and collectibles make for some good replay value and decent playtime.  If you explore and immerse yourself in the lore, the game can be quite substantial; if you bulldoze through the main campaign, the game can be quite short.  Also the DLC can add a decent amount of content, so the GOTY edition is probably a good bet if you are looking to maximize gameplay hours.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												The world of Dishonored is fantastic; it is so rich and well-established by way of in-game books, notes, overheard dialogue and even just little scenes upon which you can stumble.

			Not once.		

 Some people call Corvo, the protagonist, boring and characterless, but what's facinating is the effect that your actions - and by extension, Corvo - has on those around him.People treat you differently by way of subtle changes in speech or tone and the lasting effect on one particular character is nothing short of brilliant.As far as gameplay goes, Dishonored isn't perfect. The stealth mechanics are pretty close to perfect, with leaning around corners, clearly visible alert warnings and a multitude of clever ways to get around without being seen,

By: Atratzu




 it falls apart a bit in the combat. Corvo is heralded as a master of arms, able to 'beat three men at once', as a guard can be heard saying. Ironically, fighting more than one person at a time can be infuriatingly difficult. And that's on moderate settings.Because almost all NPCs use a combination of sword and pistol, you can cross swords only to be shot at point blank range by someone you can't stop, they can kick you; an unblockable attack that deals as much damage as a bullet, or they can just swing their sword as you jump backwards out of range and hit you anyway. Their sword range is about three times the length of their sword and you must block every single hit.The killy death tools are nicely varied, allowing for very stylish kills with grenades, crossbow bolts and shrapnel mines, and that's not even touching on the supernatural powers. Adding them, the game becomes a flowing action of combat adding a clever third dimension to swordplay (at least the way I fight). Aside from just jumping and teleporting high, time manipulation, rat control and blasts of wind are just some of the tricks you can use.Admittedly, you'll probably find one or two powers that you use more than the others, but the options are there to experiment.While the story can be a bit predictable, it serves as a good framing device to take you across the breadth of Dunwall, killing and stalking people of all kinds. Also all of the cutscenes are skippable for those who want to try speedruns.The DLC is an interesting topic, allowing a new perspective on the story as well as some different powers and amazing sprawling levels.The downside of these slow, stealth-based games is they can be lacking in F**k Yeah moments, but Dishonored makes up for that in lasting enjoyment,

												Dishonored is a true memorable game. It does everything right. You have a diverse arsenal of weapons and powers at your disposal in your story of revenge. As Corvo Attano, you put the mask of an assassin in a city tormented by chaos. Your way of dealing with problems will influence the city, since killing will take chaos to new levels or being a pacifist will get you a happy ending. Level design is well thought, so being the good guy is not impossible but rewarding, while being the bad guy is really fun. The chaotic play style is the one where you'll fully enjoy your ablities and their upgrades, but as you progress that way, things get harder, as the game adapts to you to be challenging. Assassinating your targets is fun, but handlling things peacefully is actually more attractive, as you'll deal with fascinating NPC's . If you'll take your time to explore, you'll get to know an engorssing world. Overall, this game is a gem that deserves everyones attention and while it is kind of short(I didn't wanted it to end) the score of 9.4 does it justice.			"

												Dishonored is a first person stealth action game were you play as Corvo Attano. He is the bodyguard of the Empress of the Isles but you are framed for her murder and now have to become an assassin to seek revenge and save her daughter who was kidnapped in the process. You are freed from prison by the Loyalists who are a resistance group that seek to take the city of Dunwall back. Your first night out you are visited by a mysterious character called The Outsider while you sleep. He burns his mark on your hand and imbues you with special powers to help you through your missions.These missions can be completed in a variety of ways. You can sneak through all the levels without killing anyone or go ahead and kill them all. Why not try a little of both if you feel like it. The only thing is the more you kill the more chaos will ensue. With more chaos you’ll see more rats and more plagued citizens. There are also small side missions you can complete to earn other goodies to help you out.Your weapons consist of a small sword, a crossbow, or your bare hands which can silently take out your enemies or help you in moments of confrontation. Another thing you can do is peek through keyholes to see what may be on the other side which can help you choose how you will accomplish things. You are also given a choice of ten supernatural powers which five are active and five are passive. You will need to find runes to unlock more powers or upgrade them. There are also 40 different bone charms to help enhance your powers or abilities.The supporting cast were well voiced and had many likable and unlikable characters. Everyone was well voiced which always helps add to the immersion. The story was pretty good but I just never really understood what the whole purpose of the Outsider was. I’m not sure if I missed something in the end but I felt all he really did was give you some powers and then never explain why. I also felt a there really wasn’t much to see since most of the game was basically in one area.Overall Dishonored was a great game to play and would love to see a sequel perhaps that may explain more about the Outsider. Maybe even add more missions to flesh the game out some more just not ones that make it feel like it’s just filler. If you haven’t played Dishonored yet then now is the time since the game can be picked up for cheap and it’s worth the money.Bear Rating: 9/10			"

												Not the most difficult stealth game but perhaps one of coolest...Dishonored is set in a world that resembles Victorian London, but with an odd asortment of technology that looks like it came straight out of a HG Well sci-fi novel: It is somehow familiar and alien at the same time. The visuals are pretty good as is the story, and the game mechanics are easy to pick up.The AI is generally quite good, except for a minor issue with leaning .... basically the AI will not spot you unless you could be seen when not leaning. This means occassionally you can lean around a corner and look someone right in the eyes and they wont see you. Not that this is a big issue because you soon unlock special powers that make 'leaning' seem prosaic. With the addition of magical talismans and very cool gadgets the game does become somewhat easy even on the hardest difficulty, but it somehow manages to remain a lot of fun.The missions are very well done, often allowing many different ways to succeed. You can be the cat burglar or the ghost killer, or maybe you want to possess the minds of men and beast to help gain access to somewhere new? It is up to you. Add to this many different routes in and out of every place and you have the feeling of really being free to do things your way rather than being herded by the gameIn the end, whilst I would not classify it as the greatest stealth game ever made, it is certainly one I recommend to stealth game lovers without any hesitation.See my video review here :

												I was framed for murder so I killed everyone to prove my innocence. Turns out in doing so I traumatized a small child.Oops.Freeze Time, disable the alarm, throw a grenade in the air and shoot it, killing every guard in the vicinity as time resumes and the bullet hits the grenade, causing it to explode.Pretty much Dishonored in a nutshell.Except the Nut has Super Powers.

												Dishonored - A perfect example how games should be made.11 out of 10. A masterpiece.Your actions add to story, and by ending the story you can either win or lose big, or in between. This game has everything, you can play it like an action-filled FPS, you can play it like Thief and stay hidden, you can play it being manipulative and experiencing with your magical skills and play around with your skills almost endlessly.And the story? It was great, too. I can´t figure any major flaws, even figuring out if there were minor ones is hard! After playing through I just had to sit still for 15-20 minutes and think what I had done, feelings were so great throughout the game, and passing it left so many unanswered questions that I do have to play it through again some week.Definitely worth any sum you invest into it. Went into my all-time-top10-best-games-ever-played list.			"

												Great job Arkane Studios!!! Let me start by admitting that Dishonored is not a flawless game. The AI and the stealth system could use some improvement (better overall AI, and a stealth system more similar to Thief's Dark Engine). The game has great art design and story (a little bit predictable, but still good...). The music and sound effects are really good. The city of Dunwall, which is modeled after late 1800s-early 1900s London and Edinburgh is just amazing!!! The world of Dishonored is rich and complex.I enjoyed the non-linear and flexible maps, and the different powers the player can upgrade during the campaign! That adds a lot of replay value to the game!I wish there have been more weapons in the game...A Great overall game!!!			"

												The game borrows heavily from the Thief series but in all the right areas. It has the stylised graphics of RAGE and the sword-play of Dark Messiah of M&M. The open-ended level design and assassination objectives are very much like the earlier Hitman games. There's something slightly Deus-Exy about the upgrades and something thrilling about how overpowered the tools at your disposal are. Summon rats to eat your victims! Stop time and run about your helpless foes! See through walls to find the treasure and to track the enemies ahead of you! You've probably already heard about the 'blink' move, but it's worth mentioning again. Yes, you can now teleport across levels whenever you like! Teleport onto that windowsill above the guards and they won't spot you. If they do, simply teleport behind them again and take them down within seconds.What a fantastic game! Recently I find myself getting bored of a game before the end, or even struggling to get into them, but Dishonored isn't like that- once I understood the game mechanics I played through to the end in one long sitting. Give it half an hour and you'll feel at home in the complex and dark world that it offers you.Every level is like a beautiful sandbox for you to destroy as you do so please. Just like Hitman, you sometimes go in undercover and can easily eliminate the whole level should things go wrong, but you won't want them to. That's how good this game is. It almost WANTS you to exploit the levels, but encourages the stealthier routes with more rewarding payoffs.After every mission you return to base. Back with Deus Ex I loved exploring, but now I find those bits rather dull as I want to progress to the next level as quickly as possible (only because it's so fun!). There is a decent story if you bother to follow it and your actions are mirrored by the people you're trying to save. Much like Bioshock, you're in for a rude awakening if you think that you can just go around killing people without consequence.If you like any of the games already mentioned in this review then you'll more than likely enjoy Dishonored. It's just as fun to watch as it is to play and I have had great nights with my friends simply replaying the same mission over and over again in different ways.My only issue is that it's rather short without all of the extra DLC. Or maybe I just enjoyed playing it so much I didn't realise how long it was. I know that there are a lot of things I didn't manage to do in the levels and will definitely be going through it again at some point to try the choices I didn't make before. Give Dishonored a go and hopefully get your honor back. I didn't.			"

												Dishonored.ProsGreat Art StyleAlot of hidden objects to be foundRock solid GameplayConsTypical Story lineRushed Ending.Short Story line (9 levels)Review :Dishonored is a Game made by Arkane Studios And published by Bethesda[/i] And Was Released on 9 October 2012 in North America and 12 october 2012 in Europe.Dishonored put the player in the shoes of Corvo Attano, The empress of the Isles (Jessamine Kaldwin) her Bodyguard.The game is set in the Industrial City of Dunwall.When Corvo came back from a long mission he was Framed for the murder on the empress and the Abduction of her Daughter (what he did not do).And now corvo is Being forced to become an assassin to take revenge on the people who killed the empress and framed him...The game plays in a first-person perspective.In Dishonored you are an assassin with a mix of magic abilities and normal weapons (Pistols and Swords) and the mix between those two really benefits the gameplay a whole lot...at any given time in the game you can use a Teleport magic (Blink) to teleport to nearby locations... (you can teleport about 8 to 10 meters with blink Level 1) and this really give you alot of interesting ways to take down an guard or gang member...One of the great things about this game is the fact that you really can choose how to do a mission, you can go fully stealth or go complete non lethal if you want, this gives the game alot of replay value.Other than that there are alot of hidden items and loot to be found, money you find or steal can be used to buy upgrade from the hub world.in the game there are these so called bone charms and runes what upgrade your magic abilities and just overall luck...The story of the game can become a little boring and its kinda short with giving the player only 9 missions to play...the DLC kinda fixes the problem by adding a whole 7 level extra, where you play as the assassin who killed the empress : Daud.The game has been praised by alot of big reviewing companies and in my opinion rightfully so...Even players with an Laptop or an Older PC can enjoy the game because the art/Graphics style is very simplistic and clean.and don't get me wrong... the game doesnt look ugly by any means but its not the leave of bioshock infinite The game has been released on : PC, Xbox360 and PlayStation 3Publishers website : http://bethsoft.com/Developers website : http://www.arkane-studios.com/uk/index.phpMore information about Dishonored : http://www.dishonored.comSpecial mention : The game truly heaven for People who like to SPEEDRUN Games...There for i would recommend this game to everybody who loves Action adventure game,just think of it as being Thief but with more over the top action...Thanks for reading :)(Always do more research than just reading a review, to ensure that you get the right product.)Follow my Curator page : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/ "

												There is so much I could say about this game. I got it on release and have been sipping from it occassionally like a fine wine ever since.... Holding off from going too deep into it. It's been over a year, and It's time for me to put it to rest and move on.Simply put, the engine is similar to Bioshock... The major gameplay twist beng it offers you more story-based reward for sneaking, and not killing as much as one would like.When you don't care about the effects your personal body-count has on the world around you, the combat is incredibly satisfying. Sneaking and purging each level of each sentry systematically and with precision, knocking them out and tossing their snoring bodies onto tables to avoid them being consumed by wandering rats has its level of satisfaction and professionalism as well. The art is incredible. The lead artist for HL2 has helped to make sharp, stunning geometry flare out from a victorian setting.... New technology bursting at the seems of an industrial revolution, all happening in a victorian-steampunk era world beset by plague.If you can appreciate a game that focuses on skill-systems, player focused creativity and level-flow... And if you can take your time, and let the world of Dunwall seep into your office, living room, or wherever you're experiencing this.... Rather than put on blidners and sprint right to the end, then you will love this game.Put yourself in Corvos shoes and really dig deep. 10/10.			"

												This game started out kindof slow for me.  But, it got better and better as the story progressed and is now one of my favorite games.  It has a great story, great scenery and style, and great stealth mechanics.  I would describe it as steampunk-inspired as long as you replace steam with something called whale oil.   It has a 19th century industrial feel to it and lots of wierd tech.  Speaking of stealth, it is refreshing to play a game, for once, that doesn't force you to kill everything in sight.   You don't even have to kill the bosses!  In fact, the only time I had to use deadly force was when I royally screwed up on a stealth approach and had no choice but to defend myself.  And there are consequences in the game when you continue to do so.  My skill choices probably had a lot to do with this, but I found fighting more than one person to be inherently hard.  This made it alot more exciting because setting off an alarm meant serious trouble for me in certain areas.   I found myself having to run a lot, which may not sound exciting at face value, but it forces you to change your strategy and look at problems from different angles. Like most games I own, I got this one on sale and it is definitely worth more than what I paid for it.			"

												Dishonored is the experience halfway between glorious past and dreamy future that many gamers sought for years. The combination of the incredible scope and perfect characterization of the setting makes that Arkane Studios producing high caliber, however you can't say its light shines from all points of view. Leaving much to the ""pleasures of discovery"" rather than direct narration, the dev team has made a very clear choice: Dishonored is an ode to the meticulous environmental scan that was all too often overlooked in recent years. Accuracy and dedication in every corner that is Dishonored, feature lets you play with immense pleasure from start to finish. Will be bitter for a longevity not excellent especially customers who approaches with missions to do more aggressive. However, the characteristics of the gameplay and the possibilities (also in terms of replayability) from a completely unique sandbox, to leave impressed and keep firmly glued to the screen in an attempt to achieve the greatest degree of stealth. The high expectations are not disregarded: Dishonored remains a masterpiece not to be absolutely escape.			"

An interesting scenario and multiple opportunities to complete a mission by choosing a different path remaining invisible or killing everyone, you choose. Play Dishonored at maximum difficulty to enjoy the game to its fair value, previous difficulties being too simple. To understand the whole story, I also recommend the two best DLC: The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches.			"

I pre-ordered this game back in 2012, the trailer gripped me and the screenshots got me pumped... and then I never played it, until recently.I really can't believe that I didn't pay attention to this masterpiece of a game for 3 years, it's up there with Bioshock and Half Life for me.The very first thing that will grip you as you play is the unique world and amazing atmosphere, the game is set in an industrial steampunk city that resembles victorian London, struck by a mysterious plague.. it's dark, it's gloomy and it's beautiful.There's a genuis blend of technology and magic in your arsenal and in the world around you, I lightly compare this game to Bioshock because as you progress you will unlock supernatural powers which you can use together with your weapons, you'll be able to bend time, teleport onto rooftops and even posses enemies and animals.And that's why I like Dishonored so much more than other stealth-focussed games, thanks to all these powers and weapons/gadgets you can go through a level in countless ways be it slipping through undetected or murdering everyone who crosses your path.Even better is that how you play the game actually carries weight, if you wreak havoc wherever you go the city will become even more chaotic and you'll become more notorious. There's a great amount of player choice in this game, whenever you are asked to eliminate key targets there will be multiple paths you can follow, some even non-lethal, you can literally play the entire game without killing anyone.The only minor point of criticism I have is the length of the game, just as I got really immersed I was already nearing the end, and once I beat the game I was longing for more though luckly there is DLC which is really good as well and this game definitely has a load of replayability considering of all the different playstyles and loads of collectibles in the world.I still can't believe I let this game sit in my library for 3 years, it's absolutely worth playing!

												Dishonored is inspired by the late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh atmosphere that puts players in the skin of an empresses bodyguard named Corvo, who is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin seeking revenge on those who conspired against him.An excellent example of what a good adventure and a first-person action game should be, Dishonored can count itself as one of the top games of its many genres.Overall aspects of DishonoredStoryline plus the adventure: The storyline in Dishonored is solid without losing its flexibility and well-constructed, being more than capable of giving players a very deep and easy understanding of it as it drastically changes or gets either molded by the players progression.The characters couldn’t have been better selected. Everyone’s characteristics and roles match perfectly with the game's storyline and the situation that is present resulting in a very pleasant experience for those who wish to be part of a high quality story full of events and changes.The adventure in Dishonored is something to admire. Despite being at its first look a game that resumes into successfully assassinate traitors and murderers, Dishonored offers in each mission a huge vast variety of ways on how to succeed in them. Without mentioning the numerous side quests and other characters you may encounter, contributing to an extended exploration and adventure that may or not, again, affect your main quest storyline.Graphics and game play mechanics: Dishonored uses the Unreal Engine 3, with a huge inspiration from the Victorian-Era world of England during the late 19th century. The game's graphics despite not being cutting-edge or breath-taking, match perfectly well with the game overall environment and the time period it has been designed in.The game play mechanics might look at first slightly complex or confusing due to the huge amount of ways and styles that allows players to choose and adapt in each given situation depending on the creativity and style of each player. Such complexity can be easily be turn into something simple as players get the hand of the game and get used to it with a bit of time invested in it.User interface: The user interface is simple, clean and it can be easily mastered in a short period of time despite having a fairly wide variety of weaponry which also includes magic.Music and the voice acting:The music is mostly atmospheric sounds that match up fairly well with each situation and stage that the game presents.The voice acting is formidable, it successfully combines the voice in each character to his or her role, to their physical characteristics and way of thinking.Game difficulty:The game difficulty is very well balanced to meet the tastes of those who wish an enjoyable adventure without struggling that much, to those who want it hardcore with difficult and sharper opponents.Price:The game price I would say is reasonable. A polished game with a high quality adventure with a beautiful story without any bugs/problems to point out.Despite being only a single player game, I personally believe it deserves its base price.DLC'sDishonored has a few DLC's with the purpose of expanding the existing single player game play/campaign for a very balanced price making them worth every cent you spend on.ConclusionI would rate this game a 89 out of 100 or 4.5 out of 5.0 stars. A game that combines a good storyline, adventure and combat game play mechanics perfectly, making you ask for more and more of it.			"

Dishonored, a Tale of VengeanceIn Dunwall, a city marred by corruption, political machinations, and a devastating rat plague, you play as Corvo Attano, protector to the Empress. After a long voyage to seek aid from other nations, you are finally back at home. Something has changed, however. From the dark alleys where gangs reign supreme to the brothels where the rich seek an ephemeral escape, an atmosphere of fear and suspicion has settled in.As you deliver the correspondence from the other nations to the Empress, your world shatters in a brief moment. With the blood of a nation staining your hands, only you can decide how you will seek your vengeance.Dishonored took me a bit by surprise, in ways both good and bad. It’s built on strong foundations--it’s set in a beautiful dystopian, steampunk world with a rich backstory--yet fails to execute in several areas. Ultimately, an unsatisfactory storyline, stifling gameplay, and a lack of direct interaction with the world renders what could have been a masterpiece into “just” a great game.+ The WorldThe world Dishonored has created is a breath of fresh air and it’s quite frankly the main reason the game was able to hold my attention. Much of the story is revealed not through exposition, but through exploration of the world itself (books scattered across levels, guard conversations, letters, locations). But sadly, this is going to be missed by a lot of players.+ The Level DesignWith sneaky side routes for stealth players and sprawling hubs for the more aggressive players, Dishonored provides the means for a wide range of gameplay styles. Aesthetically, the level design coincides perfectly with the world’s grim setting; ostentatiously adorned mansions provide a stark contrast to the muddied slums in which survivors and weepers reside, and the architecture blends traditional British housing and steampunk elements beautifully.+/- The CharactersAlthough the characters of Dishonored have been written and voice acted quite well, they lack in depth and development, ultimately rendering most of them forgettable; the admiral is predictably self-righteous and evidently power hungry; Martin, who I thought would get more development after his rescue, is static and in fact, gets practically no screen time; Emily is a bit more fleshed out, but again, there are very few interactions with her; Lord Pendleton is actually quite funny and realistic in his morality; Sam, the boatman, was surprisingly the character I felt most attached to. The cast isn’t bad, but it’s nothing deserving of high praise.+/- The GameplayAt first, I was delighted when I saw the vast arsenal of weapons and powers presented to me. However, when I learned that killing enemies contributes to a high chaos level, an integrated mechanic of the game, and that a high chaos levels equates to a bad ending, I was disappointed to find myself being practically forced to stealth through the game. While some would argue that it is your choice to fight or stealth, I am willing to bet most players will want a happy (or at least happier) ending.+/- The StoryFor having such a beautifully crafted world, I expected an equally tantalizing story. Unfortunately, the story has been wholly predictable thus far--I am still playing through the game--and rather generic. It’s nothing revolutionary, but what it does, it does fairly well.- The AINow the bad. The AI in this game are so incredibly blind and deaf that I laughed on many occasions. I’ve walked in wide open space in daylight and gone completely unseen by four or five guards many times. Just because I’m crouched shouldn’t mean that I’m practically invisible. Additionally, if an enemy sees you, and you manage to hide behind something, he’ll just stumble about for a few seconds and give up his pursuit. But if, god forbid, you hit an enemy in anyway, he’ll call every single guard in the vicinity over to your position. So yeah, bad AI.- The SoundFor a game that pushes you to be stealthy, you’d figure the sound would be good. It’s decent at best in this game and at times, horrid. Sometimes, I’d find myself hearing the footsteps of guards in other rooms. Also, conversations don’t fade out realistically, instead, they just halt abruptly as you walk away.- Lack of Direct Interaction with the WorldIn some of the levels, you do interact with the world (and it’s usually done very well), but for the most part, it feels as though you’re playing in an empty world. Of course,  there is a rat plague beating away at the city’s population, but I’d imagine there would be more survivors, gang members, weepers, and guards. Also, where are the engineers fixing and maintaining the city’s circuits? Where are the fishermen who provide the city with its whale oil? It feels as though the game is trying to convince you that the world is alive and breathing, but with such weak interaction with npcs, I wasn’t convinced.Verdict: 8/10Dishonored is a great game that provides players with a beautiful world to explore and a rich backstory. Unfortunately, the story and cast are unable to take advantage of this brilliance. Poor AI coupled with the game’s aggressive push towards the player using stealth and a general lack of interaction with the world lead to the game falling short of being a masterpiece.			"

												Hands down, the best game I've ever played. I even rate it higher than Half-Life 2 and Far Cry 3. Yes, I have thousands and thousands of hours playing a number of games, but that doesn't mean they're ""better"" than Dishonored. When I first got this, I'd never even played a stealth game on PC, and the only stealth games I'd played period were the first few Splinter Cell games, on PS2.Everything about this game just works; the stealth, the combat, the movement; the games overall mechanics simply work wonderfully with all apsects. The story is outstanding, and the game is designed so that your gameplay paths affect, in some ways, how the game progresses and turns out. You can kill everything that moves, be selective in your eliminations, or completely avoid every single thing the game will allow you to avoid: It's entirely up to you.The atmosphere is just...wow. When that is added to the graphical achievement, it feels like you've been sucked into a steampunk universe. More, this game caused me to LIKE the steampunk genre.The best thing about this game isn't even all that I've written, it's that the design of the game and its gameplay makes this a really good game, period, not just a good stealth game. Its a game that anyone can, and should, honestly, enjoy.That is, after all, what games are for: To be fun and enjoyed.Dishonored nailed it across the board.			"

												Dishonored is several years old now, but it doesn’t feel like it has aged a day. It’s inspired by Thief and Assassin’s Creed, but is quite a bit different from either, making it feel unique. It has many problems, but the things it does well are so good they overshadow the negatives.I’m sure it must have been a nightmare trying to market Dishonored, because it’s hard to nail down what it is in a simple way. In the reveal trailer Dishonored looked like Assassin’s Creed, but it isn’t like that at all. Like Thief, it encourages slow deliberate movement, listening carefully, and striking when nobody is looking. But at the same time the combat mechanics give you plenty of power to stand against any enemy, making it the power trip Thief never was. For example you have the ability to teleport with an ability called “blink”. This totally changes the power balance between you and guards. Despite this you don’t feel invulnerable like in Assassin’s Creed. Traversal isn’t easy, and running around is terrifying. When you sprint it feels like you’re relinquishing control and allowing yourself to miss things.The most successful part of the game is the city. It’s brilliantly realized and is what will leave a lingering impression long after you’re done. It’s decaying, with feral rats attacking townsfolk, and deadly plants getting a foothold in the poorly maintained sewers. It feels like you’re seeing the last gasps of a once great culture, where whoever is left after the tumults will have a hell of a job piecing it back together. The rest of the story gives a cold and distant impression. It’s a revenge plot, but because of the silent protagonist it’s hard to engage with it. He has no personality, and the people you interact with keep the conversations to politics, again deemphasizing simple human connection. It’s not “bad”, just cold. The plot twists can be seen coming a mile away, but when they happened the motivations made sense. They nailed what mattered most for this game. The world, the sensation of exploring it, and the power of your character felt completely in line with how the story presented it. I don’t remember the finer aspects of the main story, but I remember the streets, and the people who lived there. It’s clear that was what the developers were most interested in, and they succeeded in making it memorable.Huge parts of levels are optional, giving you a rewarding sensation of exploration that for example Bioshock never did. If you go straight at the objective you’ll only see maybe 30% of the level. The things hidden away in optional sections are often surprising, like it “should” have been part of the main path. But I’m glad they didn’t force you down a straight line, because this approach gives you a sense of control over the pace of the game. If you’re sick of a level and want to see what happens next, then you can just go ahead and advance. But if you want to take it slow, there’s nobody shouting at you to “move move move” like is so common in first person shooters. Here’s where the game feels most similar to the Thief games, as they also had sprawling worlds to explore. It’s the kind of design that makes it feel like you’ve barely scratched the surface, even if you were thorough. I love the sensation of feeling like there was more to the world than I saw, even if there might not have been. And even if I never replay the game, that air of possibility and mystery will never go away.To give the world a strong impression, the graphical style uses hand painted textures and lighting which gives it a timeless look. It looks great now, and will most likely still do so in 10 years. There’s nothing obviously wrong with the style which will date it. Color, contrast and lights all look like they should. While it might be technically simple, it shows how much more important an inspired art direction is over raw technological grunt. Instead of a dynamic lighting system, the focus was on beautiful texture and color. This works well with the kind of game Dishonored is. In Thief you were so dis-empowered that the most terrifying thing in the game was a guard with a torch. Dishonored isn’t that kind of game as you can close the gap and take out guards in seconds.One of the interesting missteps in the game is how the branching story is handled. Depending on how you play, the ending changes. This is a concept I find exciting, because this is where the developers are unavoidably saying something about how the world works. Whether you want to or not, the second you express how choices affect the world, you’re expressing a world view. Unfortunately Dishonored feels a bit too simplistic in how it manages this. If you kill people, your “chaos” ranking increases, putting the world’s story down a more violent path. This system doesn’t seem to take into account who you kill, or for what reason. The terminology of chaos and order tells a pacifistic message, that violence is never the answer, no matter the who or whys of the matter. I don’t think they should have exposed this stat between missions, as several people I know felt pressured not to play the way they wanted, because of the implicit messaging telling them they were doing it wrong. I feel they should have kept the branching story a surprise. Then when you got to the end and saw the result of your actions, it would have had more gravitas, as you’d be reflecting on it in hindsight. I’m hoping this system becomes more complex in the sequel, because it could add quite a bit of extra challenge and replayability if the story changes based on who you kill, knock out, or leave alone.I could go on and on about how good the game is. Like the little touches like how if you crouch and move close to furniture you automatically crouch even lower to squeeze in under. I kept crawling in under tables for no practical reason, because it felt safe there. It opened up new possibilities for traversal other games don’t do, as their movement tends to be more rigid. The sensation of being able to play freely inside the game’s playground without adult supervision is important. It’s why I loved Crysis 1 and hated Crysis 3. The freedom makes the game more chaotic, clumsy and less “cinematic”. But it ignites that sense of ownership of your own actions. It makes it feel more personal. And this is what Dishonored does best. The story isn’t exciting enough to inspire a drive to see the end. But the sensation of exploring this world which is on its way out, to uncover its mysteries, and the beautiful art, makes up for the shortcomings.			"

												Dishonored is sort of like a mix of Hitman, Thief, and Deus Ex in equal parts. The mission style gives you a target to assassinate and a playground of ways to do it like Hitman, the overall FPSRPG structure is pretty remniscient of Deus Ex, and you're encouraged to steal everything that isn't bolted to the ground like in Thief. If you like any of these games you'll probably also like Dishonored, though there are a few catches.The first hangup is that the AI is fine when it's left alone, but gets a little schizophrenic once anything out of the ordinary happens. If you pull a whale oil tank out of its socket to turn off a barrier a guard may casually shrug it off as the tanks not lasting long enough, then proceed to spend the entire duration of your stay in that level yelling for you to come out of hiding and never ""cooling down"". Sometimes guards will just become triggered for no reason and start running around levels with their swords drawn, even if the level finish screen confirms that neither you nor any bodies were ever found. But the more important thing that I noticed a lot more on subsequent playthroughs is that the game is very heavily built for the nonlethal/stealth player, and it has the subtlety of a brick to the face with it. The game specifically warns you in multiple tutorial tips that not killing anyone is the ""best"" way to do things and gets you a better ending, and the dialogue isn't much better. At one point you meet Slackjaw, a gang leader who gained power by killing every previous leader in the territory, and he instinctively acknowledges you as an assassin coming to kill someone. After you help him out he offers you a deal, and the only thing he offers in return is to get rid of the targets in a way that won't kill them, and he makes sure to make it a point that he won't kill them several times in the dialogue, even though to him there's no logical reason why you would care about that at all. The combat itself is built a lot more with Thief in mind, and while you can play it like an action game it's just not really that fun, due to the low enemy variety and low weapon variety. Despite these hiccups I still think Dishonored is a great game, but if you're expecting a Deus Ex-style experience where you can play actiony or stealthily and have fun both ways you might be disappointed. But if you're a fan of stealth games, Dishonored is a pretty solid choice, even if it is a bit easy.			"

												If you don’t know Dishonored at least by name, then, my friend, you’ve been sorely missing out.Arkane Studios and Bethesda brought to us one of the most amazing stealth games I’ve ever played. Biased? Maybe a little.I don’t think I need to start with what Dishonored is about, as it’s such a well-known game already, but in case you’ve been living under a rock (admittedly as I was until I got it, haha), then here: Take on the role of Corvo, the late Empress’ bodyguard, now framed for her murder and deemed an assassin. As you search for the ones who are truly at guilt and try to regain your good name (or make a new name for your own), as well as get revenge, you go through the most amazingly crafted story and world, finding out about the plague that has struck the city, as well as many other things I shall not spoil for you.Onto a more technical aspect: Dishonored is a first-person stealth/action game set in a steampunk type of world with some fantasy/magic/supernatural elements in it; I found it quite reminiscent of Bioshock in some ways, and it is an amazing, amazing] game. And this coming from someone who normally doesn’t like first person games that much, and who really sucks at stealth. The only thing that would make Dishonored any better to me right now would be if it had an option for third person.So, what’s so great about this game, you ask? For starters, the graphics are breath-taking, even in the lowest settings; and it works on lower end PCs without a hitch, which goes to prove you can have pretty cool graphics without sacrificing playability on toasters.The sound in the game and the voice acting too, is beautifully done. The voice, the music, everything seems to fit just perfect with the setting and characters. What’s more amazing is that the sounds your character makes when moving aren’t just filler for your enjoyment. If you’re far too loud, enemies will hear you, and will find you.Dishonored provides you with a varied style of gameplay, not the least of which is the supernatural aspect. It has many powers to choose from, and using them is not as hard as it appears at first. Once you get used to the controls, you find they’re reasonably comfortable, although not all of them precisely handy.But my favorite thing of all has to be the many ways you can play this game, and many ways you have to approach a mission, which just ups the replayability up to a hundred; you can try different power combinations on different playthroughs, approach everything in a rather YOLO kind of way or try to stealth your way around and be a ghost, you can even mix and match! Choose to use or even not use your supernatural powers at all, and make several moral choices that will determine what kind of ending you get after all, and what kind of person Corvo becomes. Every moral choice you make, every person you kill or not, will change how people perceive you, how you as Corvo see yourself, and the ending you get. You also have more than one path to choose for each mission, which makes it feel far more like an open world, even if it’s not really an open world game. I would definitely recommend everyone to play it at least once; it’s too much of a fantastic game, you simply can’t miss it.			"

												Dishonored is pretty cool I guess.Dishonored takes place in City 17...I mean Dunwall, an industrial city-state positioned on an island that is in no way struck by a plague and Eldritch abominations.Okay, I lied about the plague and abominations. You play as Corvo, bodyguard to the Empress and number one contender for the ""Most beautiful hair"" award. On his return to Dunwall after a few months long voyage, the Empress is slain by a group of assassins and Corvo is framed for her murder. Now with nothing to lose, Corvo is aided in his escape from prison and puts on a scary mask so he can enact his bloody vengence on those who wronged him. All the while a plague that turns people into puking cry zombies ravages Dunwall and everyone who doesn't wear goofy hats and live in houses with pianos in them.Actually, that's kind of the cool part of this game, you don't actually have to kill anyone, not even your targets, though to say the methods you use not to kill them is a mercy is highly debatable. You can go through the entire game as a pacifist, sneaking from place to place and watching people sleep without them knowing you were there. Like what I do to you. Your hair smells very nice. Oh yeah, and Corvo gets all sorts of magical super powers that helps me in his quest to steal everything not nailed to the ground.  Such as teleport, and Za Warudo, and rat lasers. These all help Corvo in his quest, though you don't need to use any of them.Dishonored plays more like a Thief game than the newest Thief, I mean Thiaf. Thi4f? Whatever. Dylan shut up. There is an economy in the game to help Corvo buy weapons and upgrades, the easiest way to make money is to rob everyone blind like the filthy knife hobo you are. Although the plot isn't anything to lose your pants over, it is interesting enough to keep you entertained long enough to make you forget you live in a box behind walmart, warmed only by a fire and Tauntaun corpses. You'll probably find some characters you enjoy to be around, but other than that, you're better off stealing everything they've ever owned and leaping out the nearest window.Should you play Dishonored? Probably, it's a fun experience to say the least. The stealth is simple, yet fun. The challenge is alright, the setting is cool, and the gadgets are fun to play with. You'll get a few hours out of the game, its definitely worth the price if it goes on sale if you're like me and enjoy not eating people food for a week.I give Dishonored a 7 out of 4 or so I guess. Hammerhead sharks are born with soft heads so they won’t jam their mothers’ birth canals. oh yeah, and here's a curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation  It's cooler than every other curator, I guess you could call it a coolator.

												Successful new intellectual properties are typically very difficult to produce in the world of game design. The process requires the developers to build all aspects of the video game from the ground up. They have to decide what type of art direction they're going for, conceive all pieces of the plot and characters from scratch, and build all of the technical systems such as graphics and combat from scratch. This is why new IPs are often rough around the edges. Sequels are so ubiquitous and generally more critically acclaimed because the developers already have an existing foundation to build upon from the previous title and they can focus on adding polish.Dishonored is one of the special few new IPs that manages to avoid most of the pitfalls and delivers a diverse, adaptable, polished experienced right from the get go.The most noticeable aspect of the game is its art design, which was deftly crafted by one Viktor Antonov, a Bulgarian art director famous for his work on designing City 17 and its outskirts in Half Life 2. His touch is recognizable in Dishonored as chaotic Dunwall shares many similarities with totalitarian City 17. Nothing feels like it was pasted over from Half-Life 2, though. Dishonored is a true steampunk game and Dunwall has it's own feel that's inspired by Victorian era London gone bad. There's a dirty river, loads of industry, and even a familiar-looking bridge. All of it is given a unique touch, and the result is a very immersive world. This is escapism at its finest; be prepared for the Dunwall to suck you in immediately and carve away the hours of your day as you explore every nook and cranny. I haven't been as enamored with a new setting since playing BioShock and first experiencing Rapture.The plot is serviceable though predictable. Daud, the conflicted villain of the game, is the strongest and most interesting character. It's a shame he doesn't get more screentime, though Arkane have remedied this with a pair of DLC episodes in which he is the playable character. The player character, Corvo Attano, is a silent protagonist. This is a negative for me since I personally detest the silent protagonist trope in video games. I understand that the goal of the silent protagonist is to allow the gamer to project his own reactions into the game, and I know that many gamers enjoy it, but it pulls me out of the experience when I don't hear my character speaking to anybody addressing him because it's so unnatural. I can't logically connect the fact that my character is mute, yet nobody in the game ever seems to comment upon it. I don't enjoy it in the Half-Life series, and I'm not a fan of it here, either. I will say that the game deserves a mention of its voice acting, particularly the role of Daud as played by Michael Madsen of Tarantino fame. Other praiseworthy roles are played by John Slattery (Mad Men), Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick♥♥♥♥♥, Brad Douriff (Lord of the Rings), Lena Headey (Game of Thrones), and Susan Sarandon (Thelma & Louise). They spent some money on voice talent, and it pays off. The one qualm I do have is the reptitive nature of the guards' canned conversational quips, of which there are few. They repeat themselves regularly which breaks immersion.The wasted landscape of the plague-ridden city can become tiresome and a bit grating. There are corpses littered about, filth, rats, and crumbling buildings galore. The design is fine but the pacing leaves you in these types of areas for a bit too long. The more civilized settings in certain levels such as the gentlemen's club and the high society party feel special by comparison, but the pace would benefit from seeing more of the inhabited areas of the city and fewer of the burned out, deserted ghettos. There are only so many ways you can depict diseased ruin before it becomes repetitive.The game's graphical muscle won't blow you away if you're used to games like Crysis 3, but the art direction props up the visuals enough to make them astounding in certain areas. There's an old oil painting feel which permeates the game, and it fits the look and feel of the setting very well. I get a sense of great design while playing this game. There aren't all that many graphical options to tinker with, but there is a field of view slider, which is always cause for celebration with PC ports. The game also runs exceptionally well on PC, so even if you're not wowed by the visuals and the art design like I am, the technical aspects of the visuals won't hinder you from enjoying the gameplay at all.Dishonored is fully adaptable to your style of play, which is refreshing in a game that emphasizes stealth. If you're a stealth fanatic (as I admittedly am), then you'll enjoy it here. It's possible to finish the game without ever killing anybody or being spotted, and you're able to accomplish this thanks to being provided the tools to move quickly and silently throughout huge areas. Blink allows you to teleport instantly a certain distance across the map, and you can also acquire the ability to see through walls. Mobility is a requirement in many stealth games, and Dishonored gives you the tools to traverse the environment quickly when needed.The beauty of the strong stealth play is that it's balanced by an arguably better combat system. The combat powers at your disposal (slowing or stopping time, possessing enemies, finishers, etc) all synergize incredibly well with one another and they allow you to take out your enemies in endlessly amusing ways. It's a sign of the design team having clearly described objectives, and I was genuinely amazed at how well the game flows between stealth and combat. I expected to play this game for its engrossing, artistic setting and ended up getting the biggest kicks out t's combat system. In my opinion it's the strongest aspect of the game, which is indicative of the game's greater value considering its already great art direction. There are multiple reasons to play this title, which helps it appeal to a broad demographic. It's no one trick pony.The only real criticism I have of the game is the clumsy way in which it handles morality. Great games have been bungling morality mechanics for nearly a decade now (BioShock immediately comes to mind), so it's not surprising, but in Dishonored it becomes a glaring flaw because they get so much else right.You're informed very clearly that the city will descend more and more into chaos if you kill your enemies rather than avoiding them or knocking them out, and your allies will begin to view you unfavorably the more deadly you are. While this is logically understandable (a lack of law enforcement officials presumably increases chaos in a troubled city), the mechanic unintendedly puts shackles on your ability to transition between stealth and combat. The gameplay seems designed to be freely adaptable so you can move seamlessly between stealth and combat when you're spotted, but it then tells you via the plot that playing stealthily and non-lethally is better. You begin to feel corralled into playing the game stealthily rather than being free to adapt to combat situations if you get caught. The plot punishes you for being spotted and having to fight your way out.It's a disconnect in design between a plot that wants to make you accountable for your choices and gameplay that wants to be flexible. A potential solution would be leaving the chaos meter to be regulated entirely by how you choose to dispatch your assassination targets. Then it's isolated to the plot and doesn't have any effect on the way you choose to play the game. It's a disappointing flaw, but it doesn't take much away from a game that offers so much to begin with.Overall, this game is a beautiful, immersive experience and it should absolutely be played by anybody who typically enjoys stealth games, or games that offer rich, engrossing settings. I'm very much looking forward to Arkane's inevitable sequel to this game.			"

												Although I've only just finished this game, even when I got it on release - I realised that I regret not playing it sooner! There's plenty of free exploration and many ""collectables"" making Dishonored one of those games that always has something more to see, no matter how many times you travel past that location. Also, one of the perks of Dishonored is that there are multiple endings depending on how you play the game, making the game have that replayability factor. Overall, if you enjoy stealth games with a hint of steampunk and assassination; this game is for you.Gathered for whisky and cigars: 10/10.Go play it.			"

												I don't actually like the time period this game is set in, nor any stealth or steampumk type games I've tried or seen friends play, so I was hesitant to buy this, even with the extreme discount during a sale. It had me hooked from the beginning! I fell in love with many of the characters, I hated other characters because of how they treated me and the other NPCs. It was a perfect combination of technology and magic, with each part challenging enough, without being overwhelming for a more casual gamer like myself. I was sad when I finished the game so I played the DLCs and those were just as good, but from a different perspective. I was so drawn to it, I played through again a few days later, changing the way I played it just to see if I could do, and it gave me a completely different outcome! I played it completely through aobut 5 times, each with slightly different or drastically different gameplay and each different decision made the game different! Amazing! I would recommend this game to everyone!			"

With the announcement of DH2, i thought i'd review one of my long time favourite Action/Stealth games. Might or might not contain story spoilers.Dishonored is a First-Person stealth/action game that is in a Victorian world mixed with very steampunkish things, such as very clunky machinery powered by ""Whale Oil"" harvested from whales. or as some call it, ""Whalepunk""You play as Corvo Attano, the former bodyguard and Lord Protector of the Empress of the Isles, who is framed for the assassination of the empress and kidnapping the empress daughter Emily, and now after getting out of prison thanks to your mutual friends, you become an assassin with exceptional talents, tasked with taking out the people who conspired against you and your beloved empress, and find emily and place her on the throne, getting various new supernatural abilites and gadgets along the way.The Gameplay of Dishonored is very fluid and flexible, giving you a large variety of options how to approach your mission, silent and surgical, only taking out your target and not being seen, or just stomping straight through the front, killing anyone unlucky enough to try to cross your path. You can upgrade and build your abilities to your liking and playstyle, was it that you wanted to just knock out neutralize your target, or brutally rip your enemies to shreds with swarms of rats, or really anything in the between. It's all up to you. The stealth mechanics are pretty great, AI isnt dumb, especially on the hardest difficulty, except for that one feature, the lean, which obviously allows you to lean to look from corners, but still cannot be spotted by doing that, even if you're sticking your ugly head out.The artstyle, character designs and world of Dishonored are one of my favourites of all time. Steampunk mixed with Victorian age art, such as the guard outfits, cities and houses, interors, machines and more.

A Screenshot of Dishonored
By: Atratzu




The World of DH is very dark, Dunwall ravaged by a rat plague, sick and poor in the streets and guards abusing the weak, the rich living without a care in the world.Enemies vary between areas and levels, from the normal City Watch guards to the big machine riding Tallboys all with their own abilities.The soundtrack and sounds of Dishonored are very good in my opinion, the music immersing you with that bleak and dark city of Dunwall as you skulk your way across those dark alleyways and bright ledges of brothels looking to drive your sword into someone's neck to avenge your beloved.The DLC that this game contains is actually mostly as great as the main game, the 2 pieces of downloadable content that in you play as the Master Assassin Daud who killed the Empress, but having regrets over it even after many long years of assassinations for his living. You get a brand new arsenal of abilites and weapons, from stun mines to summoning your assassin minions to help you in battle.. or distract guards for as long as you need to get past. In my opinion, the DLC story pieces are better than the main game. the rest isnt very significant, the challenges are cool and fun to kill time with, althought sometimes quite hard.Great story, artstyle and music, lots of variations and not a lot of flaws, which makes Dishonored a great purchase and a very good stealth assassination game.

												Dishonored rarely challenges you unless you're playing on a higher difficulty and/or are going for a run'n'gun playthrough, but that isn't really the point. With its vast levels, openness, and its plethora of different ways to play, Dishonored's difficulty comes from what you are trying to achieve, whether that is going for a full no-kill ghost run, or trying to kill everyone in the most creative/skilled way. The compulsively replayability feel that Dishonored has will have you wanting to go back and find a new rout, elimination method or combination of abilities, and will require multiple replays to fully learn and utilize game mechanics and environments. The bold stylized artistic design and colorful characters give a dark, stirring, yet beautiful pastel look to a divided world that will change somewhat depending on how many people you kill throughout. This approach to putting narrative and gameplay together works great, because if you make the choice to go through killing many people, later levels will have more enemies to fight, however if you choose to do the opposite than there will be less and it will be easier to sneak around. Although by this time the second installment is already out, I would highly recommend playing this great game if you haven’t already.			"

""Strange how there's always a little more innocence left to lose."" - The OutsiderDishonored is one of those single player experiences that you don't just finish once and cast the game aside. Youtubers such as StealthGamerBR, Volound, and CosmicContrarian are still playing this game even this year. Surely, that must mean something is special about this game right? Sure it's a stealth game about either sneaking or killing guards and getting to the main target, but the execution of the game is what makes it special.Story:The story has a steampunk theme set in the 1800s which is inspired by Half-Life 2. You are Corvo Attano, a bodyguard for the Empress of Dunwall and her daughter Emily. After the Empress is killed and Emily is kidnapped by unknown assassins. Corvo is then accused of being a traitor. Before the day of the execution, he receives a letter in jail about escaping and joining a group of ""friends"" (aka ""The Loyalists""). These are the people who are trying to overthrow the corrupt Lord Regent. Throughout the game, you will neutrailze key targets to get closer to bringing down the corrupt Lord Regent and to save Emily.""Chaos""This is a mechanic that you will be introduced to after the beginning. If you end up killing more than 20% of the population of Dunwall, you get the ""High Chaos"" ending, and vice versa (Just try to kill less people as you can and you get the Low Chaos ending. In my opinion, I don't think any of the endings are ""bad"". The city is already in shambles and you are basically the person who can push Dunwall over the edge or revive it.Gameplay:Even though Dishonored is shown to be a stealth game, you owe it to yourself if you don't try playing it with your bloodlust unleashed. As much as I didn't want to kill anyone, the first time I jump assassinated a guard, I couldn't hold back. You get to use pistols, crossbows, traps, grenades, and last but not least, Corvo's folding blade. In addition, Corvo also has magic abilities. Blink allows you to travel distances with a single click. You can see enemies through walls and you can slow down time (or even stop time).Every mission is like a sandbox. You are given a target to eliminate. How you want to get to your destination is up to you. Search the area for coin and goods. Climb up rooftops or go beneath all the guards.One thing I had a gripe about was playing a ""Clean Hands"" (Don't kill anyone) run. It isn't as fun as killing everyone and the only thing you can really do is either choke or shoot enemies with a sleep dart. If you do plan on not killing anyone, look for optional tasks. They can allow you to complete your mission without getting your hands stained in blood.Sound:I love the tunes that play with you enter a new area and just how the music changes when you go from stealth to combat. Music is one of my favorites, especially when the harp plays. Eavesdropping from guards will help you and also give you a bit of context of the area around you. Should you buy it?:Dishonored 2 is already out, but that doesn't mean that this game shouldn't be cast aside. It's one of those stealth games that don't really require you to slowly sneak and then have to reload a previous save because that one guard saw your foot. Even if you might not like the steampunk style setting, I'd say Dishonored is still worth a purchase. It has dropped down to $10 and during a sale, it can go down to $5.			"

												I've been meaning to give this game a try before Dishonored 2 came out.  When Bethesda announced that for a limited time you could get this game free with a preorder of Dishonored 2, I pounced on the offer. This game is really fun! The main appeal of it to me was its dynamic story; it can play out with a lighter tone or a very dark tone depending on how many people you kill. You have a plethora of different ways to kill the enemy, as well as ways to take them down in a nonlethal manner. You can sneak up on them and put a knife in their throat, or you can put them in a chokehold and knock them out. You can blast them in the face with a shotgun, or put them to sleep with a tranq dart. You can summon a swarm of rats and watch them LITERALLY DEVOUR your enemies... or you can stick to the shadows and slip by the enemies entirely. The amount of tactical freedom in this game was staggering, both with how to dispatch your enemies and how to move through the level. I'm trying to keep this spoiler free, but as a warning if you want the game to play out in a happier way, I highly, HIGHLY recommend you play as nonlethal as possible for the first half of the game (first 3-4 main missions). From what I could tell, the tone of the story was largely determined in that time. I'm rather disappointed with how depressing my story ended up; you are given a warning at the beginning of the game about the consequences of playing highly lethal, but I didn't take it seriously enough. I unleashed utter carnage in the first few missions and killed all of the main targets. After the first few missions I already started to see the negative effects that my actions were having on the story. I decided I needed to change my ways: the whole second half of the game I played very nonlethal, sparing all the main targets and inflicting very few casualties. But it was too late, and the story went spiralling down despite my best efforts to turn things around.All in all I loved my time in the world of Dishonored, and am REALLY pumped for the second installment!

												As a fan of Thief and Bioshock games I find this game amazing. The stalking option works well in the game the enemy is not too dumb and your abilities are not too overpowered as I first thought. Also the games gives you more option where and how do you want to go in. My only problem was that the main story was a little bit short and the final mission was flat bevause there was not a big duel or something like that you can just stalking around of course and taking down the main enemy silently. But in an other missions you had the choices how do you want to eliminate the targets lethatl or non-lethal so it works very well and gives more freedom for the players.I hope the developers will give more freedom for the players with more side missions and an open world like Witcher 3 does. If they keep the good old things from this game and they give an open world to Dishonored 2 then the new game will be amazing too.			"

Dishonoured is one of the FEW games out there that I have actually played, enjoyed and completed the whole game before moving onto something else. I highly recommend this game, there are a few things in games that I enjoy and this game ticks almost all of them!+1 Stealth+1 Magical Powers+1 Multiple pathways to complete the same objective+1 The decisions you make effect the game's story+1 Much much more...I will without a doubt be getting Dishonoured 2!

												After you try to play the game under the following rules:- Never detected, No Alerts (Shadow)- All side objectives completed- Try DLCs, especially ""The Brigmore Witches""- Listen to non-player characters talking- Find all collectables (blueprints, rune+bonecharms etc.) You will find the game has a fairly decent story. One excellent feature is that you can save whenever and wherever you want.This gives you chances to play through the game with different creative ways.You can fire an explosive arrow to the sky and drop kill one guy when the falling arrow hits the other. Plus Chloë Grace Moretz voices Emily Kaldwin. 11/10			"

												After avoiding Dishonored for years (not intentionally) I finally decided to pick it up and I can't believe I missed out for this long.If you like stealth games, you'll love this. There is a skill system which warrants different styles of play. This creates some replayablility. The story and world is interesting. The game's art style is great.So all in all Dishonored is a great stealth game with a good story, fun combat, and an intriguing world. Definitely worth the money.EDIT: After thinking about it for two weeks I'm not compelled to buy Dishonored 2 for full price after beating the first one. This game only gave me about 17 hours of gameplay and I don't feel a need to play through it again. The only reason I say that is because the second one is fairly similair in length. So this game really is a great value for it's current price tag but I couldn't imagine ever paying $60 for it.			"

												What a ride. After 30hrs of sneaking and incapacitating hostiles, I started a new game and wreaked infinite chaos upon enemies and not just them, courtesans and hobos too. I didn't feel very good after finishing, though after a while my feeling of being dishonourable turned into a roguish smile, when I watched the ruin of Dunwall visualized in the ending. But that's not the point. The point is that this game truly makes your choices matter. Whether you really work hard towards not killing anyone, not being seen the whole game, sparing all the main targets or just simply kill everything that moves with a loud pistol shot, the game reflects upon this and makes it evident, not just in the quantity of rats, but in the behaviour of your allies. When Samuel told me to get off his boat in the last mission and shot in the air to alert everyone, that really hit me. When compared with BioShock's choice of harvesting or saving the Little Sisters, this seems far more superior. Apart from BioShock / System Shock or Thief and Deus Ex, this game was heavily inspired by Half-Life 2, using very similar visual design of the dystopian city and its propaganda. The previous game of Arkane Studios, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, is one of my most favourite games ever and Dishonored just totally maximized its wonderful ideas and became one of the best games I've ever played as well.

English Version: When I saw the trailer for the first time, It intrigued me a lot, especially for the wonderful soundtrack that I still listen, so I decided to try it.The plot is fairly simple and straightforward, but you still manage to appreciate some of the secondary characters, who result very intriguing, even if they seem to me very poorly characterized. Corvo Attano is a quite complex character (also because his personality can vary depending on the choices you make during the gameplay) and so External and Daud are. In addition, the city of Dunwall, with its specific scenarios in different missions, is very suggestive.The possibility of having always an alternative option in all missions makes the game much more enjoyable, so you can play completely stealth. But I played it several times, so I could enjoy every final and the simple consistency of having a different ending for the actions you take in the game is something that I thoroughly enjoyed and which can not be said of many other games.It's the story of a city, Dunwall, gripped by a plague epidemic. When Corvo Attano, who is the royal guard of the emperess (who was looking for a cure to the plague that afflicted the city from other countries) comes back bringing bad news to the Empress, she is shot to death by a murderer appeared from nowhere and little Emily, the daughter, is kidnaped. Our protagonist is indicted and brought to the prisons of Dunwall and from there the adventure begins ...I highly recommend it, I liked it a lot.Italian Version: Quando vidi il trailer la prima volta mi incuriosì parecchio, sopratutto per la splendida colonna sonora che tutt'oggi ascolto ancora, così decisi di provarlo.La trama è abbastanza semplice e lineare, tuttavia si riescono comunque ad apprezzare alcuni dei personaggi secondari, che seppur poco caratterizzati mi son risultati molto intriganti. Il personaggio di Corvo Attano è parecchio complesso (anche perché è la scelta dell'approccio al gioco del giocatore, che determina la personalità dello stesso), così come quello dell'Esterno e di Daud. Inoltre la città di Dunwall, con le sue specifiche ambientazioni nelle diverse missioni, è molto suggestiva.La possibilità di aver sempre un'opzione alternativa in tutte le missioni rende il gioco molto più godibile, in modo da poterlo giocare completamente stealth. Tuttavia l'ho giocato più volte, in modo da potermi godere ogni finale e la semplice coerenza di aver un finale diverso per le azioni che compi nel gioco è una cosa che ho apprezzato moltissimo e che non si può dire di molti altri giochi.È la storia di una città, Dunwall, in preda ad una epidemia di peste. Quando la guardia reale dell'imperatrice, Corvo Attano, torna dalla missione (nella quale cercava un rimedio alla peste che affliggeva la città da altri paesi) portando brutte notizie all'imperatrice, la stessa viene colpita a morte da un assassino comparso dal nulla e la piccola Emily, la figlia, rapita. Il nostro protagonista viene incriminato e portato alle prigioni di Dunwall e da lì inizia l'avventura...Lo consiglio vivamente, mi è piaciuto parecchio.			"

												I just finished the game and I can say it's simply fantastic. Ignore all of the people saying it's ""just hype"" or ""nothing new"" because I honestly have no idea what these people are talking about. Dishonored offers it's own feel with a taste of cartoony graphics in a gritty steam punk world, with excellent and complex gameplay to compliment it. The story is good and though the missions are linear, the missions themselves are a sort of open area where there are many side missions. If you rush through the game like a lunatic you'll probably finish the game quick like a good number of foolish reviewers...but if you actually take your time and play the game it'll last a fair amount of time, maybe just a tad short. Make sure to note that the ""choose your own way to do the mission"" holds true throughout the entire game, Dishonored does this extremely well.It's not about making some original amazing breakthrough game that'll make you go insane with astonishment like many seem to think, it's about making an entertaining game. All in all, it's definitely a very fun game that's worth your time.			"

Murder tons of people to prove you did not kill someoneOr not, it depends on your choice. Take control of Corvo Attano (funny name eh), as you are framed for a murder you did not commit and embark on your quest for vengeance against those that plotted against you. That vengeance can take many forms. Unlike many games out there, you actually have the freedom to play as you like. You can choose the pacifist way and not murder a single person, therefore guards can either be avoided or knocked unconcious, or you can become the terror of the game's city, Dunwall, and butcher through the ranks of your enemies. Or you can do something in between, the choice is yours. Keep in mind though, the way you play the game has a massive impact on the city and dire consequences. I will not tell you more about it, you just have to try it for yourself (nobody loves spoilers).To help you in your quest, there's an elaborate power system and equipment upgrade system. Corvo's powers can be customised as you want and they open plenty of options that will make your life easier. For example, you can see your enemies through walls, increase your jump height, upgrade your boots for quieter movement, increase your speed when you choke guards etc etc. Each perk and upgrade will help you either in combat or stealth and you have no constraints if you want to choose a middle way and pick something from both, like I did in my first playthrough.Each mission is designed as a sandbox, allowing you to choose the approach you want and you can take your time, exploring the surrounding areas helping people in need, looking for treasures or overhearing conversations or you can just go straight for your objective at the cost of several chances to upgrade Corvo.As you progress in the story, new factions and enemies are introduced, which give you a feeling that ""the tides are shifting"" and introduce new challenges for you to overcome. As an example, a particular mission introduces a new type of foes which can not be easily outmanoeuvred, leaving you with the option to charge at them or find other, stealthier paths. It's a nice touch to the gameplay, but the sub-plot lacks a bit, leaving you with the feeling of a rushed addition. It would be nice to see a couple of things explained a bit further.Visually, the game is a little bit odd at best. Its style may remind you of an oil painting, always shifting, always in motion. It has beautiful lighting, soft textures and smart use of colors. From the terraced urban streets at night to grand, royal palaces the setting reminds a lot of the Victorian England era. However, the hands are too large to be real and the facial animations could have been a lot better. In general, the characters seem bulky and slightly badly drawn, probably because of the whole painting-like themed graphics. Personally, I did not enjoy it that much. In general, visually, there's nothing too special about it, but you can look past that with ease.Still not convinced? What if I could told you can become a rat, neckstabbing wizard? What about then?

												""Their fate rests on your effort. On the strength of your hands, and of your heart...""Arkane Studios and Bethesda really outdid themselves with ""Dishonored"". It's an amazing stealth FPS that'll leave you wanting more.You play as Corvo Attano, the Empress's Bodyguard and you've just brought news from foreign land in seek of help from the rat plague that has infested the city of Dunwall. Due to unforseen consequences, you are framed and became enemy of the state, hence the title.The story of the game is not bad, but not great either, although I love the ending that I got. Some parts are predictable while others are unexpected. I do love the fact that your actions affect the outcome of the story. I feel as if I have control over the game and not just following a scripted flow of events. Plus, making wrong/different decisions add drama and tension to the plot which makes you careful in deciding what to do next.  Visuals are smooth and well-made. It's using the Unreal Engine 3 so you'll find it somehow similar to the cartoony nature of Bioshock Infinite, but darker. I honestly prefer the atmosphere of Dunwall to Columbia, for reasons I am not entirely sure of :/ Ambience wouldn't be complete without music, and it fits very well with the visuals. It's by no means the best, but it's just perfect for the game.Now, I wasn't really a fan of the stealth genre but ""Dishonored"" made me think otherwise. It's fun, smooth and rewarding. You wield a sword in one hand and a Charm/Pistol/Crossbow/Trap/Grenades in another. It's kind of confusing to sort them all out, but once you do, it's fast and easy ^_^ Speed and silence is key, this game rewards you for not attacking enemies head-on because once you do, they will outnumber you in a matter of seconds. I love how you can play the game at your own pace, you have to go from point A to point B, but it gives you freedom how to get there e.g. Use the rooftops and go unnoticed by ground forces, or use the shadows to slide past your enemies, or explore the area to find hidden passages. You're given the tools, and it's up to you, how you want to use them.Overall Experience: This was honestly one of the best games I've played so far. I just love the freedom it gives you in gameplay and the astounding atmosphere it sets you in. You don't need a high-end PC to play this game, it's very well-optimized and that's always a plus for me ^_^ I highly recommend ""Dishonored"" even if you're not a big fan of stealth.Tip: Explore the surroundings..... you'll find untold stories that add to the ambience of the game.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Arkane Studios Publishers: Bethesda Softworks Initial release: Oct 2012Genre: FPS, Stealth, Open World, Action#Worth/NotWorth: #DefinitelyWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationDishonored might be one of the best stealth based games EVER made. Hyperbole aside, I'm not even kidding. Dishonored places you in the very capable hands of the Empress of Dunwalls head bodyguard Corvo Attano. The game begins with everything very calm and rather jovial. The empress's daughter Emily even invites you to play hide and seek as a form of a tutorial. Soon after the Empress is attacked by assassins and Corvo easily fends the first few off, however one succeeds after restraining Corvo and quickly vanishes leaving Corvo lying next to the slain Empress. Thus, 'Dishonored' begins. Near the beginning of the game you're greeted by someone known as the Outsider. He grants you the ability of magic to include teleportation, seeing through walls, among other things. For obvious reasons, he remains elusive throughout the game. The freedom of movement is rather unique and something I've not really seen other places. The movement, the narrative and the setting (London-esk during the late 1800's ) Where technology and magic exist together though the latter remains known only to a select few; Comes together in a package that feels unique like no other games quite hit every spot right like this. Additionally, the narrative goes along perfectly with the actual gameplay. Each target as well as each objective that your rag tag team of seemingly misfit people assign to you in an attempt to prove your innocence and regain order, can be dealt with lethally or non lethally (which leaves some room for ambiguity) This may seem like a trivial distinction in most games, you might assume that doing either will get the job done and your next task will be marked. However, this game keeps track of each kill, each time you where seen and a number of other things that all go into your overall chaos rating; which markedly changes the world. The way people react to you and what defenses may or may not be set up to dissuade you from completing your task. I've played through twice now, DLC included (which is remarkable. Some of the best DLC I've played since Bioshock Burial at Sea and the Witcher 3 DLC. I am not even close to joking. And I wholeheartedly think you should play that as well should either having more missions interest you or seeing the story from another perspective interest you) I've taken the High Chaos and the Low chaos route; the game takes the best from Thief and adds more content and playability to make it a near perfect product. You can be the stealthy rogue on a mission with a heart of gold or play the ruthless killer bent on revenge and the world will reflect that sentiment. I am in love. Follow my curation for more "

												I love this game. A good story line, beautiful art style and suspense. You can go stealth or blades gunning if you want, which will affect the over all ending of the game. Excellent controls and the stealth style of gameplay is really polished. I also love how you have multiple ways of completing a mission. I kinda hate that you are able to freely save the game and load your quicksave, takes away a bit of the challenge, but you can limit yourself just not to. The music score is alright, not the greatest, but it is there.I would say give it a shot if you find it cheap, well worth your time.			"

												Do you like Jumping off 100 metre heights and assassinating someone on the ground while taking no damage?Do you like to see money through walls?Do you like to drink water so you can teleport forever?Do you like to eat rat skewers?Do you like to get your own squad even after what happened last night?If you answered yes to any of the above then why the hell have you not bought this game yet. BUY IT IT'S GOOD.Jokes aside, Dishonored is a great stealth game (probably my favourite) with a choose your adventure sort of style. From sword fights in the streets to firing crossbows from roofs to sneaking past guards by teleportation, the game is filled with different playstyles that suit any type of gamers.9.5/10 Would visit this game again in future			"

I have this game twice in my steam library, thats why this one has so less hours than the other oneThis game has something that really took my deepest interests. Well, simply said, before, I have never though that I will be ever touching this game. But my boyfriend made me think otherwise (thank you). So I had to purchase this game, and I couldnt leave it for a good, solid week.> Awesome atmosphere! Steampunk, dark, gloomy city in the middle of an epidemic.> Very well written characters! The main character in the base game is a ""silent protagonist"", so he obviously, does not speak, but it does not even matter.> You affect the world as you play. If you make too much mess, the city will become more and more deadly to you. And otherwise.> Very short though. The main story can be completed in 8 to 10 hours if you play it for the first time.I have completed the game in 4.5 hours while going full stealth run, second time after. Knowing some shortcuts (no glitches)> The DLC is worth getting. There are DLC that will expand your story! You will enter the opposite side of the storyline.> Very interesting artstyle. Peoples faces will make you giggle sometimes.Well, what could I say more about the story. Its mostly the story YOU will make out of this game. You might like it, you might not.Thats up to you to decide.			"

												Do YOU like loading screens? Well then you're out of luck, 'cos in this game, they're more of a subliminal message flash than a loading screen. I probably didn't even get to read the majority of the loading screen tips.A very Assassin's Creed-like game, if Assassin's Creed were capable of producing a story you actually cared about. As predictable as the story can be (Really, we're achieving all our goals this early? That seemed a bit easy, I wonder!), I found myself connecting with it, with Corvo, with Emily, with poor, ol' Sam. The game isn't just about calculated choices to achieve ends that I want. I found myself passionately hating certain characters. I felt disappointment when I realised I won't get to put a knife through their eyes. I felt mercy after hearing the tale of another character. And so it goes. And if you want a bit more challenge, play through the game without killing anyone, or being detected - and not just because of the associated achievements. There's genuine focus and thought necessary to clear out clusters of enemies. Figuring out the enemy patrol patterns, best angles of approach and the timing. Heck, I probably spent a good hour clearing out one part of Flooded District, home to the Assassins. I felt genius anxiety about there being an assassin around the next corner or on the next rooftop, and very overlapping patrols/sightlines. Overall, it's a great game with a less-than-original story that is presented incredibly well. The combat mechanics aren't the greatest if you just run around with knife and pistol, but once you start being a bit more creative, you can have loads of fun decimating piles of Watch Guards. Just do yourself a favour and reconfigure the combat controls, blocking with Mouse2, Sword attack with Mouse1 and Power/Gadget on a thumb button of preference worked really well for me.			"

												What a masterpiece. There's a lot of differing opinions about this game, but I'm not sure why. You know all those games that boast ""multiple choices"" and ""multiple endings""? You know how whenever they say that 99% of the time the choices are meaningless and the endings are decided by a quick ""yes or no"" question at the end? Dishonored is nothing like that. Every choice you make, every person you help, every thing you kill has an impact on the the story and gameplay. For example, the more people you kill will make more rats and ""zombies"" (called Weepers in game) appear in later levels. Not to mention that depending on who you kill could hugely affect other characters, and they remember. They will mention it multiple levels later. If you help them, they remember and pay you back later on. This all may seems simplistic in nature, but how the game plays and handles it is all the best I've ever seen. The multiple choices doesn't feel like a gimmick, it feels like the game was made around it. So lets talk how the game actually plays. It's a really good stealth game. Each level is very open allows TONS of options with how you want to go with things. Every level I felt like I was the first to ever go the way I did, that I discovered a new weird route, though in reality, the developers made that one of the paths available. It's not that long, about 14 hours, (and that's with doing almost all of the side-quests) but I know that you'll end up playing it much more than that. There is SO much replay value. It was the first game that I was really excited to replay it, before I had even finished it the first time.			"

												Dishonored... This is the video game that got me so hooked as if it was a TV series.  I even dreamt about it once.  I wanted so much to make good decisions in every turn of the game.  And most of all, I wanted Samuel to be proud of me coz he deserves it.  He saved my life.  He was though until one time I decided to be a jerk out of curiosity.  To end the siege of Hounds Pit Pub, I decided to burn everyone using Piero's and Sokolov's machine.  But, I unknowingly killed Callista (who's like a mother to Emily too).  I had no inkling she will be included in the machine's targets.  Piero said enemies only.  Anyway, after the end of siege, I met up with Samuel.  I felt his razor sharp words cut through saying what I had become in between while giving me information about Kingsparrow Island.  When we reached the destination, he didn't wish me luck (like he used to) and was practically throwing me out of his boat.  He yelled get out of his boat like a couple of times, even fired a gunshot to alarm Kingsparrow Island guards -- which it did.  I had to run for my life.  It was my last boat ride with him too.  I was surprised and still am.  It was like real life and didn't feel good at all.  Well, it's a good thing it is not real life.  Dishonored is spellbinding!  It was like a drug for 2 weeks straight for me.  Still high on it to this day.  PS. Sorry for any spoilers.  :)			"

												You can't describe to someone who wasn't a gamer in 2004 what the first playthough of Half-Life 2 was like, but you can have them play Dishonored, and that's just as good. That feeling as you rush through the Flooded District, of being dangerous and powerful but isolated and hunted, in a world that is both horrific and starkly beautiful in its devastation, playing a strange cosmic game for the favor of an inscrutable and cruel patron - the only thing missing is headcrabs and a horrible airboat section.If you never played HL2, play this so you can feel those feels without the vehicle section fail. If you did play HL2 when it came out, play this game so you can relive that old glory and ruminate on how far gaming has come. If you are any kind of single-player video gamer, I cannot recommend this modern classic enough.			"

												You should play this game. Briefly, here's why:1) It is fun. Not content to simply shoehorn mediocre gameplay into the gaps between story, the developers have managed to make a game where simply BEING Corvo is fun. Running around, double-jumping, and using Blink to explore rooftops... these are actions that would be enjoyable even in the absence of story entirely, and other powers continue to add interesting ingredients as you unlock them. That they THEN wrapped this gameplay in an interesting story is the proverbial icing on the cake.2) The art. LOVE the art. The character designs are in my personal Top 3 (with Brink and DE: Human Revolution) and the environments are beautiful too. I could (and probably have) spent hours just appreciating the visual style.3) Open to different play-styles. You can treat it like a shooter and kill everyone, or you can finish the entire game without killing a single person. (Or somewhere in between.) Furthermore, the environments themselves offer great flexibility in terms of your desired approach, instead of just being narrow corridors funneling you along the intended path, like many other games I won't name here.4) It is a polished, AAA, single-player-only, original IP. If that sentence doesn't make you nod with respect, you haven't been paying attention to the past few years of AAA games and the epidemic of ""Sequelitis."" It takes real stones to make a game like Dishonored happen in an age where publishers are VERY reluctant to take risks. The fact that Arkane and Bethesda stepped up to the plate is admirable, and the fact that the resulting game is actually GOOD is something worth supporting.			"

												I love this game so much I've bought it 6-7 times for different platforms. It is my absolute favorite stealth game in the world, with steampunk-like enviroments, a pinch of magic and many different gadgets. And then there is this floating dork of a God who just stalks you while going on either a murdurous rampage or silent stealth mode, in a city filled to the brim with nasty rats and some sort of weird zombies. Did I mention it's my favorite game? Buy it if you like stealth games, if you haven't bought it yet, because why have you not bought this yet??? Dishonored 2 is on it's way, and it should be EVEN BETTER! Holy Moly, 10/10 best game, best game.-Would always recommend Dishonored. Angry Dad Simulator.CORVOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO			"

												You play as Corvo Attano, the bodyguard to the Empress. You go on a personal mission to rescue her kidnapped daughter Emily. In the dark and depressed city of Dunwall. It's always nice to see a new quality franchise. Dishonored is a first person stealth assassin game, where you get the freedom to choose who to eliminate and how. Your playstyle even has some effect on the surrounding world, for example if you go on killing everybody, there will be more rats in the city. Your choices also shape the ending. It's possible to do completely non-lethal run of the game, which is one of it's great features.  The art style is magnificent, it's a bit caricaturized victorian steampunk. There's also huge amount of high profile voice talent in the game. Including Susan Sarandon and Chloë Grace Moretz. The games weakness to me comes from the upgrades, while most of them are inventive, fun and open up different possibilities how to approach the game. Some are just bit too overpowered and make the game too easy and other skills useless. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a great stealth game with rich characters and story. If you want, you can also play it as straight up action game. While it truly shines with more stealthy approach. The choice is yours. [Score: 92]			"

												Pretty sure I finished this game for the 3rd time now.It's just such a great and fun game.You are a bodyguard for an Empress who get's killed by Assassin's and you get set up as the person who did it.And it's up to you to clear you name.This entire game can be played without in stealth and you don't have to kill anyone.Or you could just go all out and kill what you want it's up to you.You have special powers such as teleportation, vision threw walls and summoning evil rats.The era this game is set in is a Rat invested plague time and it's a great era for games.Every DLC is worth getting, but as this game is old you should buy it on sale.They all add a new storyline and new insight to the game which is lovely.

All around from gameplay to it's design settings, beautiful all the way.Some might argue the rather linear storyline, in which you are sent in missions that require you to ""go forward and reach the next checkpoint, repeat"", there are a multitude of ways and several paths you can take in order to reach your goal.

My Experience:Civilians screaming for help? Sure thing man! Dishonored: ""You must kill them or leave them, no rescuing!Me: ""But...""Dishonored: ""No buts!""Me: *leaves the building, watching two innocent civilians scream for help. *sobI shall feel guilty until the day I die.My Review:This is a great introduction to horror games in my opinion. This isn't even a horror game, but since I'm the jumpiest person to ever walk the Earth, this was enough for me. The atmosphere is so tense. Just walking around my room, and I was expecting a jumpscare..in game of course. I was going to try the Metro Redux series, but that seemed too scary for me, so I came to this. The difficulty settings are great! For once it isn't just that enemies are stronger and you are weaker. Yes it is that, but it's more. The main thing being the perception of the AI. It's really good. REEEEALLY GOOD!The fighting is good too. I hate those games where you face 10 enemies, and when you attack one, the others stand around just watching...wtf man do something! This is not the case here, as when I walked around the corner (like there's only one in the entire game) I was swamped by guards all slashing at me with their knives, some standing back, only to be throwing %&$#@!# grenades.To assist you with the stealth gameplay, you are able to peak through keyholes and, forgetting logic, you are able to ""peak"" around corners to see where everyone is...It's not just peaking though, it's leaning your entire body apart from your feet out of cover. And yet you remain unseen? This is not a bad thing though. Just questionable.As many people say, right click=left hand and left click=right hand, this can be confusing, but it makes sense to have your main weapon as left click.I can't wait to see what they have in store for Dishonored 2!GET IT OR REGRET IT "

Product received for free
												I played and beat this game on free weekend, and yeah, it's about as good as everyone says it is.Because my reviews are always obnoxiously inconsistent, this time I'll write a list of pros and cons:Pros:-Excellent stealth level design as well as nonlinear design (For example, every level obviously directs you go to the same location- But how you get there is up to you. For example, when crossing a bridge, do you take the direct route? Do you climb up into the higher levels of the structure? Do you hide in the maintanence shafts and crawl under the guards' feet?)-A pretty cool universe. While the story's just ""Good"", the actual universe the story takes place in is almost stunningly original. I'm not gonna act like I haven't seen steampunk before, but Dishonored is far more than just that.-A large range of different playstyles-Suitable recognition of all those different playstyles-QUICKSAVING-Excellently fun abilitiesCons:-Too much stuff is clearly designed for non-stealth gameplay. Don't get me wrong, options are always better, but there's not enough stuff stealth players can upgrade compared to crazy, non-stealth players. This isn't that bad with Runes but with buying upgrades it's extremely glaring. The only thing that directly advantages pacifist stealth players are sleep dart upgrades (Which you won't need if you're doing a Ghost run and not being seen), and boot upgrades which you only get in the extreme lategame.-It's also noteworthy that in my first playthrough I managed to buy every single money upgrade in the game- I did loot as much of the level as I can but it's a little ridiculous I was able to buy literally everything.-Bodies despawn- Or rather merge into each other. This is a little hard to explain, but I noticed in my playthrough that leaving multiple bodies together would result in me coming back and finding only one body. Whatever the case I don't think this is acceptable for a stealth game, bodies despawning is a big deal.-The Good ending is a bit anticlimatic. Obviously it's good, but let's just say you won't get the big battle you were hoping for. In the other endings you're put under significantly more pressure.-There are boss fights, and I'm amazed that they're all optional- But I personally didn't like the way they played, unfortunately.However, all these things are relatively minor marks on an otherwise unbelievably enjoyable game for the reasons I listed above. It's important to distinguish when a game's flaws does and doesn't overshadow the entire experience, and Dishonored's flaws certainly don't.			"

												INTRODUCTION:Dishonored is a First Person Stealth Action-Adventure game released in 2012. It seeks to be the spiritual successor of the popular Thief series who, back in 1998, had set a very high bar for the stealth game genre.The player steps into the boots of Corvo Attano, an elite bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles who was murdered by a shadowy organization of assassins. Accused by the people and condemned to death by the State, the player will follow Corvo's struggle to redeem his name, avenge the death of the Empress and stop any usurper from claiming the empty Throne.PROS:+ Action and Stealth Balance: -The game offers different ways to finish a mission and multiple methods of completing an objective. The game can accommodate player preference, whether they like action, non-lethal stealth or assassination oriented approaches. Use the various tools, skills and powers available to your advantage. Just beware of the consequences of your Actions.+ Great Visual Design: -The city of Dunwall is dark, wet, dilapidated, poor, disease stricken and all of this are completely beautiful. The game boast a unique texture design making the whole world look like it was oil painted, this gives it a unique personality and a gorgeous aesthetic. The city itself has great atmosphere due to the people and the overall level designs along side the Steam Punk theme. There is a large world to explore in-between and during missions.+ Rich World: -If the player takes time to explore and discover some of the lore that is spread around the game, (like books, letters, conversations, the different character's thoughts by using 'The Heart' item), the City of Dunwall, 'The Isles' and the world in which it is set, suddenly becomes alive.+ Complex Political Intrigue: -The main plot itself is straight forward and a bit cliche, HOWEVER, if you take the extra time to listen to conversations, reading thoughts (See above), and go out of your way to discover non-lethal solutions to your main objectives, you will uncover a conspiracy that goes far deeper than what you expected.CONS:- Voice Acting: -The voice acting is not 'bad' per se, but at times, specially with certain characters, it feels kind of stiff or lifeless. Some people might find this annoying since it can really pull you out of the otherwise great immersive experience.- Limited Non-Lethal Takedown Tools: -Aside from your choke hold (which have only ONE animation by the way) and sleep darts, there is simply a noticeable lack of tools for the non-lethal track. Watching the choke hold animation gets boring after a while. Would have loved it if they incorporated other animation types or different moves for non-lethal takedowns like an inverted grab and choke from a ledge or a ceiling beam perhaps?-Occasional AI Glitches: -I normally don't put glitches or bugs as cons, unless, they occur more than I would like. I have played this game 3 times already and on each one, I encountered some bizarre (but hilarious) bugs that causes some of the AI to do some weird stuff. Not game breaking though, it's more like a minor annoyance than anything else.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME! A true spiritual successor to the Thief series, Dishonored creates an amazing stealth system while adding new characteristics and twist that makes it a truly exceptional game.If you're the type of gamer who is into gun play than anything else, then I would NOT RECOMMEND this game for you. Dishonored encourages combat variation by mixing ranged, magical and melee attacks. The different weapons and tools, including the gun and crossbow, only compliment each other and it is ill advised to only focus mastery on one.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Dishonored is amazing. If you want to murder everything in sight, you can. If you want to stealth through the whole game, you can. If you want to take hours exploring every corner of the map, talking to everyone, you can. Good mechanics, thought-provoking stealth, and nice story which changes based on how you play. If you enjoy the base game, purchase ""The Knife of Dunwall"" and ""The Brigmore Witches"" DLC.Top 3 game of all time for me. Amazing.			"

												My absolute favorite game EVER!Let me explain you why:Dishonored can be played in a countless of ways, not just stealth, or non stealth; every level has many different ways to be cleared and explored. I started playing this game the non stealth way, destroying anything that so much as looked at me sideways. What I love about this, is that it affects the ending a great deal, your actions have consequenses!So, after my first playthrough, where I brutally obliviated everyone in my path, I decided for a more stealthy approach, and it was the most fun I've ever had playing a game!There's so much to do in Dishonored, I'm still not done discovering, and I've cleared this game quite a couple times.That gets me to the bit of the game that I didn't like so much.Dishonored has a VERY short storyline, and I feel like they rushed it, an extra mission or two would've helped. Then again, the story is VERY well written, and it all checks out so well, on both endings.Also, there's a lot of side missions, and non-lethal approaches for dispatching key targets, and a lot of hidden objects to be found, wich makes the exploring of a level a lot more interesting.I also love the special ability's Corvo has, the 'Blink' is a teleportation wich comes in handy whenever you find yourself in a nasty situation, and you need to escape. It also proves its worth in combat, when you blink up to an enemy and slash his throat, he'll never know what the f*ck hit him!There's a HUGE number of upgrades and tools that can be bought, powers will have to be accuired and upgraded by finding 'Runes'.One thing is for sure, you will never find yourself bored playing Dishonored.Graphically, this game lacks very little, the only thing I'm a bit bothered with, is that it doesn't run very smooth on my PC, but that's more due to my PC, I can't blame the game for that :P.So... to summarize:Pro's+Beautiful graphics.+Great gameplay, many different options and approaches.+Very good storyline.+A lot of secret areas and side missions to discover.+Combat is fun, but stealth is AWESOME+A HUGE number of different tools and weapons, which makes the killing all the more fun!Con's-Short storyline, could've been longer-You need a decent PC to run this on.10/10 -It's a piece of ♥♥♥♥ing art in my opinion!

												A action-stealth game of epic proportions, Dishonored is a game about choice, stealth, and that little panic that happens whenever someone looks your way at the wrong time.In Dishonored you can make your way through the streets and sewers of the city of Dunwall as you sneak or slaughter your way through patroling foes and plagued citizens to accomplish your missions and explore a city on the verge of ruin. To help you on your way you have a number of otherworldly powers allowing you to teleport, manipulate time, summon rats, and other useful abilities.You also have an arsenal of equipment to assist in your endevors, state of the art weapons, high tech gadgets, and a telescopic mask that will allow you to choose weather to fight your way through your enemies, or take a more subtle appoach and mearly knock them out.Choice takes a major part of this game as you must not only choose your appoach through the missions and their multiple paths, but you must also choose how to deal with those who wronged you and caused your dishonor.All in all Dishonored is a great game that will captivate stealth fans as well as offer something even for those who prefer a more direct route, as you explore a wonderful world on the brink of collapse.

												Betrayaled, heart broken, assaulted, imprisoned. My Empress is dead, murdered infront of me, and her dauther is kidnaped. They're going to execute me at sunrise...But I am the one who's going to execute them before it rises.This game is beautiful, tricky, challengive sometimes and fun. The story is good, but it can be predictable, but when the plot twist hits you, it's a slap right in your face and feels, making it personal. Game mechanism is like in any good PC games and the look of the game and characters are well made. Only bad things are, for me, when you mess up badly, and usually all the stealth games are the same. But this one stands up from that mass and can even rival Assassin's Creed and the Thief games well. And there is also some DLCs for this.			"

												Unlimited assasination combos, this is the life.You are Corvo, the Queen's formal bodyguard. Within this game, the emphasis is on choice. Throughout the whole game you can choose, to assasinate or detain, to kill all opponents or dispose of them non-lethally. You gain rewards, medals if you do the mission non-lethally. Another large part is gaining Whale Bone Charms or Runes to upgrade spells. The game can be played over and over and over again each time trying a different difficulty, or collecting all the Runes and WBC, or doing the mission non-lethally.Although I found this game fairly short, I was amazed at the possibilties and graphics the game had to offer. Every detail was considered and looked into to improve the gameplay and quality. There are many ways to eliminate enemies, such as backstabbing them, or jump stabbing, or pulling off epic blade combos, or assasinating the enemy with a bow, or shooting them with your gun. There are also non-lethal ways, such as Sleeping arrow, smothering the enemy unconcious, shocking the enemy with an electric bullet. The possibilities are endless.. All the characters were thought out carefully, every aspect of their emotions and wording showed there personality. The plot is fairly good, between missions you can relax and talk to your so-called ""allies"", each ending with you sleeping. All-inall this game is amazing and I enjoyed every second of it. I failed in the end, and made a mistake. having known the characters so well, I felt sad for a while. This game is something on its own.First Posted: 26/11/2014Last Edited: 26/11/2014			"

												Rating: 9/10Overview: First Person Stealth/ActionThe Good:+Steampunk with a Victoria era aesthetic provides an unique look not seen in any game + The level design is phenomenal, rivaling the level design in the Deus Ex series. Every level provides multiple ways of completing objectives. Every level is fun to explore and encourages multiple playthroughs to see how events unfold. + By playing more action oriented, killing lots of enemies, later levels will be different than those who took a stealthier approach. Later levels will have more enemies, characters will speak to you differently and major objectives will also be different. This is something that really sets itself apart from other games in the genre.  + The main story and characters are interesting and every level has books, notes, and letters scattered around that flesh out the world, locations and lore. + By finding runes you can upgrade certain powers. The main power is ‘blink’; the ability to move very fast covering a short distance. By using this power, you can move to hard to reach areas and discover new pathways to complete objectives. + Lots of graphical/gameplay options+ voice acting+ The 3 pieces of DLC are also excellent. The fist is the Dunwall Trials. 10 levels that feature combat, stealth, and speed challenges with a lot of interesting ideas thrown in the mix. These trials are difficult and getting the achievements even harder. The other 2 pieces of DLC tell the story of another character where you play through 6 more levels which are just as equally good if not better than the main game. The Average:+/- Despite the great art style, textures seem blurry and low resolution.   The Bad:-  If you decide to play stealthy and want a no alert, no kill playthrough, you may accidently alert or kill someone without knowing it and the only way of discovering this is at the end of mission, in which case you would have to replay the entire mission over again.  Conclusion:I love this game and the genre itself. The art style, level design and gameplay all come together in one complete package. Like all stealth games, it can be very slow paced which is why you also have the option of killing your way through with sword and pistol.  "

												I really enjoyed stepping into the skin of Dishonored protagonist, Corvo Attano. He is quiet, agile, smells really nice, has fun abilities and a thirst for revenge, oh yeah!You can rush through this game in six hours if you like or you can easily get 30+ hours out of it if you leave no stone unturned. Personally I take my time and have fun with it but I have little patience for boring books or the shenanigans of the good people of Dunwall. Fortunately I am free to ignore them, like I ignore most side missions, missing out on some rewards of course. MY POSITIVES- First person- 110 FOV- Various ways to reach your goal- Be non-lethal or join the dark side- Useful and fun abilities with room for creativity- Fetch runes and bonecharms to further enhance Corvo- Stealth was satisfying- Revenge is sweet- Nice story- Nice setting- No timed missions afaik, I did not do all side missions thoughMY NEGATIVES- Corvo wears half a bottle of Davidoff Silver Shadow yet the dogs never pick up his sent- Normal difficulty leans a bit more towards easy- Could do with a bit more tensionHAPPY BOXES TICKED- Customizable controls and FOV- Inverted Mouse and Mouse rebinding- Save game and Quick save options- Reduce head bob is possibleI paid €3,29 for this which is shameless and influenced my review a bit. Had I paid full price I would still be enjoying it but I'd be disappointed in some main missions  (I believe there are 9) for being too short if you're not careful.			"

												Great Game,Was in my backlog for over 3 year i think xD I bought it and it's DLC When ESO Just came out and was Pay to Play.Great Story and Mechanism, like how your killing and nonlethal methods effect the outcome of the game and how other ppl interact with you.the endings changes and all :Dto be honest I forgot how much I wanted to play this till i saw Dishonored 2 coming out, then I remember this and now that i played it I feel it was greatly satisfying :DJust an advice in playing,If you want the good ending and nonlethal ways, Start from the Start !I played first 2 mission like mad ! killed all !but then I had 2 no kill mission and 1 Ghost with only 12 kill and 2 other mission  only 3 and 8 kill !but Chaos level keep on staying at high :| I even did extra saving of Civilian and test subjects and all :D			"

												Went through this game once as a nonlethal ghost.Went through a second time as a revenge driven badass killing anyone who stood in his way.Went through a third time to  see Emily fall to her death Dishonored is honestly my second favourite stealth game. (sorry nothing can beat MGSV) It has numerous endings that change depending on how you play, a dynamic world that changes depending on how you play, characters who change depending on how you play. Everything you do in this game affects something. Whether it be more rats and guards on the streets of Dunwall, or a character hating you for something you did. getting her uncle killed, sorry not sorry It really is just a game you have to experience.

												Pros:Character development.Weapon customisation.3 different endings.This can run quite well on my other potato laptop.Realistic violence (Sometimes)The DLC is worth the moneyCons:£7.99, are you mad?9 missions.The diologue is very repeated throughout.Sometimes Clichesome runes and bonecharms are in impossible places.If you know someone who doesn't like the stealth genre, give them a copy of dishonored and they (might) take it all back. The story may be bland and cliche in some parts. But it's original and that's what sticks out. I cannot say how much I adore this game enough.My verdict, 9.5/10A must buy.			"

												The first time i played this game i fell in love with the main characters and the story line. The graphics are amazing and look unique to anything iv'e ever played with many little details to give you a feel of the atmosphere. The gameplay is truely inspirational making me play this game over and over with many different options allowing you to decide how you want to play, the lore and secrets of Dunwall really give you an idea of how the developers want you to feel while playing this game, whale oil powers everything? Truely unique and original ideas by the developers have made this game feel very special and making you feel like a true hero as you take out many important figures using non-lethal ways makes this world really fun to explore, the only criticism i have is that the storyline can be hard to follow because it is SOOO in-depth so if you are playing while listening to music or not concentrating on the story-line you will miss out on a lot of the secret stuff and you will miss the entire point in what you are meant to be doing and whyThanks Bethesda for the experiance! :D			"

												What a great game. It sat unloved in my backlog of games for too long, but was a realy treat to play though. Each level was a toybox of options, powers and situations that made them fun to explore and best. I opeted for the ghost/no kills option but I love that I could choose to go violent. Dishonored is the closest thing we have to a proper Thief game since Thief 3, and given that Arkane basically stole the game out of Squeenix's lacklustre guards I think that is just fine. Well worth your time if you enjoyed the Thief series mixed with some Half Life 2 and Hitman.			"

												As Corvo Attano, shield to an Empress, players wind up in Dunwall, an unsanitary port city whose masses is being decimated by a rodent considered torment. It's a front line setting; a figuring town made rich off the back of the whale oil that powers the city's circuits. It's likewise a hive of debasement, political stratagems and power getting, and this all goes to the fore when the Empress is executed, and Corvo leaves to strike back for her passing. That requital can take different structures. Not in any way like such innumerable diversion legends, Corvo is not pre-designated to be a mass killer. The whole diversion should be possible without butchering a solitary individual, so screens can be evaded or beat careless, and non-deadly decisions can be found for death targets. Unmistakably, in the event that you need to cut an insane swathe transversely over Dunwall, that is offered sustenance to likewise. Fundamentally be cautioned: murdering your way to the end of the distraction has distinctive results. All the more dead bodies surmises more rats and more watches, and a darker general conclusion. In the occasion that you're anything like me in any case, you'll most likely grasp a framework that is some place in within – at any rate for your first play-through. Whatever you do, the mechanics are exceedingly adaptable and every setting has been wanted to give players different options for satisfying any one target. By system for instance, in one mission Corvo has two focuses to assume out inside a position with an embarrassment history, however there is, unmistakably, an other contrasting option to murdering them. On the off chance that you can discover another visitor in the complex and induce him to surrender the code for his secured, you can then give this code to a character in the Distillery District and he'll make both your objectives vanish. In my first playthrough, I got the code, however went and disposed of both the goals in any case, then took the substance of the safe for myself. These sort of decisions make missions altogether more fascinating than if players were basically enriched with the standard thing 'go here, execute this' targets. Considering all things, it's really the minute to minute gameplay decisions that make Dishonored so convincing. The approach you take will at any rate halfway be coordinated by how you've changed Corvo, and these choices are unfathomably liberal. Each of the distraction's ten qualities can be opened in any request (after Blink), and each can be redesignd. Runes disguised all through the world are the money for opening and overhauling powers, and that interest is amazing fun without any other individual. For my first play through, I concentrated on utilizing and wander up three center qualities: Blink, Dark Vision and Agility. Flicker is a short range transport that is productive for moving from cover to cover, getting the skip on adversaries and scaling structures. Dull Vision permits players to see foe enhancements through dividers, in addition highlights other essential request on the planet. Deftness, then again, is a uninvolved power which manufactures hop stature and change speed, and reduces fall hurt. As should act naturally apparent, I settled on deftness and stealth most importantly else. You may well pick totally specific breaking points and purposes of intrigue. In the occasion that you're battle centered, tornado sends adversaries flying and is truly down to earth, as is immediate time, which genuinely sets time when completely wandered up. While two or three forces are more noteworthy than others, it's a not all that awful choice and mind blowing lovely to endeavor unmistakable things with. They're moved around more standard weapons: crossbow, gun, explosives, spring razor, et cetera, and these can all be redesigned as well. Players who truly set aside the opportunity to esteem the experience are remunerated as well. The more runes, bone charms and cash you locate, the more you can augmentation and overhaul your character, and the all the more revolt you'll persuade the chance to be. Truly, by the last couple of missions I was unreasonably intense; arranged, making it difficult to stalk, cover and butcher effectively. It's honored there are hard and additional hard bother settings to proceed ahead to, which increase the perceptiveness of enemies and enlargement the general test. It's besides tremendous that taking out the certifiable focuses in every mission can regularly be to some degree a disappointment. In all cases you have a credible favored position over them – paying little regard to how vivaciously secured they are. That is a lamented main problem, regardless, in light of the way that Dishonored truly is about examination and experimentation as much as a complete objective. This is one of those redirections in which you'll spare once in a while, reloading over and over to attempt unmistakable procedures, until you get each gameplay vignette basically right. It's in like way one of the prettiest redirections by and large years. The craftsmanship bearing is inside and out incomprehensible, and it's sorted out with a visual tasteful that makes the world take after an oil painting being developed. Insulted isn't battling on detail; it's driven by delicate surfaces, vigilant use of tones and isolated, and dazzling lighting. From terraced urban avenues to mechanical stockrooms, crippling strongholds to mind boggling magnificent residences, it's Victorian England meets City 17 meets whalepunk. The character showing is unimaginable as well, paying little notice to the probability that the facial improvements could be better... moreover, unconventionally greater than typical hands could be more modest. It's an irreverence that Dishonored's story isn't more noteworthy than the aggregate of its altogether essential parts, yet its gameplay thoroughly is. Every mission is filled in as a separated plan of decisions for players to look at, and the same can be said for Corvo himself. Every player's affirmation of qualities, purposes of intrigue and various overhauls will illuminate how they see and cooperate with this world, and no two play-throughs will be certainly the same. Disrespected is a distraction you'll talk with your mates about, and that you'll need to play various times. In this joy there are constantly particular ways to deal with be taken and differing difficulties to overcome, and that is an animating thing surely.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												I have a hundred steam games, played some more non steam games, and have went through stacks of console games that are longer than a Tyrannasaurous Rex's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and out of all these games, Dishonored still stands to be my favorite. Although the game may be short, I feel like this is a good thing as the game is so good it makes you want to replay, and as you replay thhe game you get to experience new things you never experienced on your first playthrough, whether it be your first time shoving a knife in a guards neck, or your first time sparing your main targets, the gameplay stays fresh whenever you replay the game. One thing that disappointed me with this game is the lack of stealth equipment, as your arsenal is quite low for stealth, and it makes the stealth route less appealing, however the stealthing itself, and the mechanics of it are really nice and make it enjoyable for me. If you enjoy murdering everyone in sight then this game will make you very happy as there are so many creative ways to kill people using the supernatural arsenal of corvo, when someone shoots you, you can freeze time, put them in front of their own bullet, then after their dead summon a swarm of rats to clean up for you. The story, although being short is really good, especially since the choices you make directly change the story, and you progreesively see the choices you make changing the environment around you, making you feel more connected to the choices you decided to make in game. I bought this game around when it came out and it went on sale for 30$, the prices has obviously dropped since then, but I feel I have gotten way more then my money's worth, and I guarantee your money would not be misplaced upon buying this game "

												Corvo Attano logic:1. Kills hundreds to prove he is innocent.2. Sentences his targets to ""non-lethal"" fates. Some of these benovlent fates include giving away a female target to a creepy stalker, sentencing two men to work in a silver mine for the rest of their lives, making a person an outcast from his order and torturing him with hot irons.3. Leaves the task of finding his illegitimate daughter at a BROTHEL to search for ""runes"" :/4.Is apparently Frisk's brother from Undertale since he abuses save feature much like Firsk.5. Has to poke his nose in EVERY trvial matter whatsoever.6. Poisons a person's water supply and subsequently plots with him the next day. No sleep lost.7. Steals food from poor people.8. Eats rats to regain vitality(DLC only). Does not get the plague.9. Takes off mask. Can still use mask optics.Finally the last and the best. He is a ♥♥♥♥ing master assassin with Godlike supernatural powers. He has killed several people who were deemed invincible. Has fought pseudo-zombies, Supernatural Assassins, Machine terrors, Swarms of Rats with great successs. Still gets defeated and killed BY A ♥♥♥♥ING FISH,Peace.			"

												Dishonored is a unique stealth game that allows you to progress through the main story in two fashions: killing a lot or killing nobody at all. The outcome of the game is the same in both paths, but the events that lead up to it vary depending on the choice.The powers you obtain are interesting and beneficial to a typical stealth game ranging from teleportation to mind-possession. I found myself using them more often than the actual weapons you are given including a crossbow and foldable blade. The art style is also sweet and unique. The texts and imagery presented to you in the UI and objectives tabs look like straight-up paintings popping out. The graphics aren't overly intensive, but still pleasing to the eye. The story felt a little predicatable, but maybe that is just my own opinion. Overall, Dishonored is well worth the money.			"

Amazing gameplay, dialogue, story, art direction, world, level design, freedom, and replayability. The biggest strength of this game is that you can be extremely creative with how you kill your enemies or sneak around, lending itself to many playthroughs and playstyles. The amount of detail and lore put into the world is just staggering, each note and book you find only adding to the fascinating world of Dunwall and the cities beyond. As icing on the cake, the voice acting is top notch and you can always catch interesting conversation between guards and noblemen alike.I can ramble on and on about how wonderful this game is, but you should play it for yourself. It's rare to see a game that's so well crafted in every aspect. 10/10			"

												With its fantastic mechanics and grim but dull setting, Dishonored remains a favorite of mine, and a great accomplishment for the genre.Dishonored is a first-person stealth action game set in a heavily Victorian inspired world where you play as Corvo Attanowho after being betrayed and blamed for the murder of his beloved Empress to whom he served as an agent and personal bodyguard, meets a being shrouded with incredible mystery.. A higher entity referred to as the Outsider.With the assistance of the Outsider, who chooses neither evil nor bad, only whatever is of interest to him, Corvo gains 'magical' powers.Dishonored does a great job in balancing your set of physical tools and magical abilities. Neither are enforced. These only give to the already vast variety of playstyles and add through the magical aspect of this game a great deal of depth to the gameplay and mechanics.As a silent protagonist, Corvo is an empty shell the player is supposed to fill.Little to big differences in the world are made as a result of your actions in it. Your actions have impact. The way you affect the world is not common.It's not just what you say to this person or that character, it's your playstyle.You dared not to hurt a soul? From that you gain as part of your reward cleaner sewers. Meaning less weepers (a certain type of enemy) to avoid or kill or render them unconscious.You've been a good boy? Good job, little sweet Emily's drawings is that of a happy, sunlit place. You've been bad? Well, you can see that reflected upon the new dark, sinister characters in the paintings.This succeeds in making you feel regret for acting as you did, playing as you did as Dishonored manages to get you emotionally invested in Emily's character, and when you see her drawing of you, smiling bright, you smile in real life. But when you don't get to see that happy creation, cheerfully titled 'Daddy' you see the masked murderer you are.Whether you choose to see her turn you into her savior or her fear, a tower with flowers and a rainbow or murderer with a bloody knife and a pile of bodies is for you to decide through your playstyle alone. It's important to mention that these specific details are not forced, as you might not even notice them while playing through the game. They are worth glimpsing at though.This all sounds awesome, right? What a wonderful mechanic.Well, not necessarily. The only reason to purchase any game at all and play through it, is for the sake of your personal entertainment. It's your game, you should choose to play it however you wish to. Now, although I am all for the specific player-action-affected events I stated above, Dishonored has one heavy punishment for the player should he choose to be a bad boy.Paintings are one small thing. Game ending is another. And that is broken. Unknowingly, you will be punished by the game's ending if you carelessly killed all who stood in your way.This is wrong. This is not a 'your choices matter' game. This is a game you play for the fun in its gameplay and mechanics, for its openness in level design, letting you move on from this place to the next however you'd like to.Giving you a bad ending is a needlessly unforgiving and punishing mechanic.Your way of enjoying this game shouldn't be a negetive deciding factor for the ending which you receive.For stealth-action fans, I'd consider this game a must have in your game library.Of course, not that you can't have incredible fun with it if what you're into is decapitating enemies or watch them being eaten and devoured alive by swarms of rats controller by you. Honestly, it can be just as satisfying as bypassing every guard without being noticed.Dishonored is a fantastic game. Its setting is an incredible fit. Its mechanics in gameplay are a joy to use and the animations do a magnificent job in delivering the satisfaction of a kill. And while the story may not be the most interesting, I did find myself invested in some of the characters and I did find myself immersed to extreme measures with the world of Dishonored to the point where I found myself reading the different notes and excerpts scattered throughout the game to enrich my knowledge of the interesting lore behind it all.I'd also like to mention the DLC expansions in which you get to play as one of the antagonist and see through his eyes and reason. The extra story enables you to experience and understand the mindset of the very person who set you upon this path for the sake of money and greed. A path which brought nothing but horrors bestowed not only upon you, but the entire city as well. If you liked Dishonored, these are a must-buy.Overall, it was one hell of a ride and I enjoyed it immensely.			"

												What made Dishonored great in 2012 is what keeps making it great as I replay it all over again in 2017. It is not just the finely tuned stealth gameplay; or the coherent, immersive worldbuilding; or the iconic, dismally dystopian art; or the myriad possibilities of reactivity to the player’s choices and gameplay approaches... It’s all of these things and more.Originality is not creating something from nothing; instead, it’s creating something great inspired by many other great things. Dishonored is unashamed of its inspirations and influences. Not only is Deus Ex the main, pervading inspiration and influence, the game was developed by three Deus Ex veteran developers: Harvey Smith, Ricardo Bare and Austin Grossman. And that’s very evident in the intricate, multilayered, multisolution level design, and the pervasive verisimilitude in lore writing. Add that to the fact that the art was designed by Half-Life 2 City 17 creator, Viktor Antonov, one of the greatest artists in the games industry. It is a recipe for a masterpiece, which is what Dishonored is indeed.Developed with the Unreal Engine 3, it runs butter-smooth, especially on 2017 hardware. Unlike its successor, framerate is not an issue. This is not a photorealistic game, however: the character design is supposed to look slightly cartoonish, as in BioShock or Fallout. The textures could use some improvement, but it’s still visually stunning even five years later. The gameplay, when skilfully played, becomes surgically delicious. There is such a wide array, such a range of possibilities to kill and maim and behead and dismember... but also to not kill, to incapacitate and render unconscious and move like a ghost, which is arguably the best way to experience it, because it is more challenging. It gives the player freedom, granted: you can go in guns blazing and knives slashing; but this is not a shooter or a hack-and-slash, it’s a stealth game that rewards patience and planning, a tactical approach to missions. And as such, even after five or six playthroughs, you will still manage to find details and approaches that you didn’t originally, which makes it truly rewarding.The story has better reactivity than many RPGs out there. Depending on how you approach the missions, who you kill or not, the characters, and the notes and books you find along the way, change and react in a way that is almost lifelike. The case can be made for the fact that the reactivity rewards nonlethal gameplay, but even in a severely lethal playthrough there are so many interesting moments and reactions from the characters.Above all, Dishonored is deeply immersive. It was custom-made following the immersive sim school of game design, which has its roots in Ultima Underworld and Deus Ex. While it is a linear game in its formula, the gameplay and the interactions with the world are far from linear. Instead of a game like a maze where the player follows the intended path and finds the only way out, the immersive sim design allows the player to make his own way and find his own way out, to come up with his own solutions to puzzles and situations, sometimes even in ways the designers themselves could not have anticipated. This is what games are supposed to do; this is how the medium sets itself apart from any other medium because it does something no other medium can do. And that’s what Dishonored did and still does.			"

												Favorite game of 2012, I pre-ordered it and loved it.Gameplay is smooth whether on a mouse and keyboard or controller. Combat has several ways to integrate all types of play styles, from murderous desperado to a ghost, Dishonored gives you the option to take out enemies (or don't) however you want. The powers Corvo has (which are optional as well) are interesting and help create some of the most interesting game moments, and the upgrades actually do something. AI could be better, but it's passable on higher level difficulty.Great design and art direction make Dunwall (despite being plague ridden and filled with a corrupt stand in government) an interesting place filled with colorful characters. The lore in this game is a bit buried, but listening to conversations or reading some of the many books you find around Dunwall will clear a lot of it up.Story is pretty good, there are two endings based on your chaos level (how many people you kill, alarms you sound, how many bodies are found yada yada yada) but it's probably not what you'll be focusing on, with the exception of Daud (which is why the Brigmore Witches and The Knife of Dunwall DLCs are highly recommended) nonetheless it's a nice part of the game.Dishonored is a beautiful game that still plays and looks better than some stuff getting shoveled out, if you didn't like the Thief reboot, or want a stealth game you can play over and over, I really really recommend Dishonored.

												I don't Know what to say about this game other than it is amazing. Unlike Skyrim it isn't as open world but it gives a nice story allowing you to sneak through the game or just rush in and kill everyone. The thing is that the Bethesda knew people would want to just rush it than stealth it to make the game faster but they put a very clever system in this game that fits in great to the lore of this game that makes more enemies appear if you kill to many people and gives you a bad ending making stealth much more prefered. I surprisingly didn't find a single bug also in this game other than a lighting bug on a single model, I found this very surprising as games with 3D models and of this size tend to have more glitches in them. All in all, great game, fairly high replay value, I would suggest buying it.			"

												If you are a fan of stealth games, then you are in for a treat in Dishonored - a first-person stealth game heavily inspired by the Thief franchise (and a few others).Going straight to its selling point, mechanically, Dishonored is near flawless as far as stealth games are concerned, no doubt about that. It has been more than long due to finally see a stealth game which provides such vast possibilities for approaching your objectives. Want to use the rooftop to get in? Go ahead. Prefer getting in through the sewers? No problem. Want to become a fish? Sure, why not. The things I wished Mark Of The Ninja (a brilliant 2D stealth game) could have done better were granted in Dishonored. Aside from common mechanics seen in almost any other stealth game such as hiding in shadows and sneaking past guards, the addition of magic abilities such as Blink, Possession and Time Bending provide a new layer of depth in the gameplay. Although these abilities do make the game fundamentally easier than the old-fashioned stealth games like Thief, with some a bit too overpowered, it is remarkable how creative you can be with them. This makes a playthrough totally different than the next one and increases replayability. Even without its new mechanics added in, the fundamental ones which define a stealth game are up to par in Dishonored. The only time when immersion seems to break is when you hide underneath something, like a table or inside a fireplace, after you have been spotted and the alerted guards stand idiotically in front of you doing almost nothing to you. Sometimes they throw objects at you, but otherwise you can stay there and cheaply kill everyone else near you, one by one. This is something which I experienced not once, but a couple of times in the game. So yes, there are a few AI issues, but these are mostly encountered rarely.Funnily enough, Dishonered unashamedly took evident inspiration from games such as Bioshock, Half-Life and, unsurprisingly, Thief in its visual presentation, narration and level design. As a result, while its setting may look all cool with its blend of steampunk and Victorian London, it is hard not to feel like it borrowed too heavily from the aforementioned titles. “A City Unlike Any Other” is written in its description on the its Steam page which is a bit “dishonest” – it is nothing more than a modernised City 17 from Half-Life 2. Obviously, this aspect is just me nitpicking it and does not retract how beautiful and well-designed the world in Dishonored is, although you would have expected the person who once worked at Valve and envisioned City 17 in the first place would at least attempt to create something actually new rather than a rehash of his previous work when he moved to Arkane Studios. The point which is being made here is that there is nothing to praise about in terms of originality, but again, that does not make its setting any less enthralling. Graphically, it looks pretty good despite some textures feeling noticeably washed out. Whether this was an artistic decision, I cannot say. Its soundtrack is also good, but nothing too memorable though.With an interesting premise, the story in Dishonored is perhaps its weakest aspect. You take the role of Corvo, a bodyguard of the Empress who eventually gets framed for her murder and gets thrown in jail. With the aid of underground allies from the outside fighting for the same cause (finding the real murderer), Corvo manages to escape his prison cell and begins his long quest in avenging his Empress’s death and protecting her heir to the throne. All-around, the story feels only slightly above average – it honestly is neither great nor bad. In fact, what puts it above average is how your actions in missions do actually affect the narrative of the game in some form or another; even when you start questioning how the moral system implemented actually works when the game punishes you for things you might not have done (or was forced to) if you are aiming for the good ending. Annoyingly, the game offers plenty of cool gadgets to use in your missions and you just cannot resist using some when the occasion arises, but indirectly lets you know that you are a bad person if you kill someone. At the end of the day though, if you are someone who does not care about which ending they get or can pretend that is the ending they got, then you are free to approach things whichever way you want, blazing through or sneaky peeky. Anyway, the story is by and large pretty forgettable with its only major plot twist also getting somewhat predictable halfway through the game. Sadly, most of the characters in Dishonored tend to end up feeling not fleshed out enough. “Why should I care?” was a frequent question running through my mind all the time. “Because you’re the great Corvo and we believe in your skills!” said someone amongst those lines in the game, more than once. Well, okey, thanks bud. Heck, even Corvo becomes a pretty uninteresting protagonist due to a lack of personality and the charms of someone like Garrett from the Thief games. Corvo’s only motive is to simply avenge his Emperor’s death and protect her heir to the throne, Emily, a young girl who I personally had no attachment whatsoever throughout the entire time, even when the game forces her on me. Muted protagonists have been done better before, and Corvo is not a great example. Take away all of its story, then you come to realise that what you are playing are nine missions with relatively large environments to play around, which alone I am personally more than satisfied with. Then, does its weak story affect the enjoyment of the game? Absolutely not. In actual fact, the entire game can practically be played without paying too much attention to the story as long as you complete your objectives successfully, thanks to Dishonored's gameplay.Conclusively, Dishonered is a mechanically brilliant stealth game, if not the best in recent years, and a true modern homage to the classic Thief games. It hits that sweet spot in its gameplay. With new interesting mechanics added on top of staple elements from the stealth genre to keep things fresh and a myriad of possibilities to approach the mission objectives, Dishonered is a blast. Where it lacks in story and characters to care about, it compensates in one of the most satisfyingly fluent gameplays and level designs in a stealth game. It really is the type of game where its gameplay outshines everything else, even with its small issues. So if you like stealth games, then Dishonored is for you.			"

												Dishonored is a 2012 stealth action-adventure video game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was released worldwide in October 2012 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Set in the fictional, plague-ridden industrial city of Dunwall, Dishonored follows the story of Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him. Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalists—a resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall, and the Outsider—a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities. Several noted actors including Susan Sarandon, Brad Dourif, Carrie Fisher, Michael Madsen, Lena Headey, and Chloë Grace Moretz provided voice work for the game.The game is played from a first-person perspective and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions in a variety of ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.Storyline is amazing.1 of the best games I have played. :DRate: 11/10			"

The graphics are interesting and difficult for me to describe, but I believe that they add quite a bit to the atmosphere and steampunk aesthetic that the game possesses.  This charming game is well worth a buy for those who enjoy stealth or action games, as it can be played as either genre or as a mix of the two.			"

From protector to assassin to the outsiders right hand man can you save Emily and restore the city or plunge it into chaos and mayhem.

												Well I feel like it's time for me to review a game, so may as well choose one of my favorites. To get started, messing about with the powers you get is extremely fun, I personally like jumping off something far away from and enemy, blinking mid air and getting a death from above which felt pretty good.You can do some really cool things that you can probably see on youtube, one of which I saw was where during the duel this guy used his powers in a sequence to make it so 3 people die in the blink of an eye. I would put the link in here but I don't want to advertise. There's so many things you can do, in fact so many that I played through it multiple times each time focusing on something different. It's hours of fun as you can see from my play time. I stopped playing for a while but I got back into and once again I'm thoroughly enjoying it. That's it for now.Thanks for reading "

												One of the best games I've ever played.I came to it late, having only seen screenshots with a lot of sword-fighting and shooting, but as usual the major reviews did the game a disservice, because Dishonored is so much more than that.Firstly, you don't have to harm anyone.  You don't even have to be SEEN by anyone.  Play as the good guy who is out to right the wrongs done against him and the people of Dunwall, and the game will pan out differently to playing as the angry guy out for vengeance - with a totally different ending to go with it (incidentally, I recommend playing BOTH styles to experience two different games).  As a result, there can be a lot of stealth-play (if you choose that play-style) and it's all very well done (though the stealth mechanics are not quite up to the stealth mechanics of Thief).  Secondly, the art style is incredible - one of those games where you just want to take stock and look around.  It's a very atmospheric game, though as usual the story revolves around ""white male trying to rescue young female"" (like we haven't seen that done to death already) and all the female NPCs are in some kind of servitude role or p♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (Arkane loses some Brownie points for that).  But the story is incredibly well executed, the world extremely well designed (I must have played this game through some 20+ times now, and still find secret passageways, vents and such I can use) and it's just about the usual 15-20 hours in length.Finally, the controls for keyboard and mouse are incredibly easy - a delight to use.  No clunky awkwardness with button combos or anything like that, and no having to commit different keys to memory.  The early levels are actually a combined story opener and tutorial.  Again, very well done.All in all, an excellent game and one I thoroughly recommend (along with its story-based DLC packs).			"

-Quick Review-Dishonored is a first person stealth-based game developed by Arkane Studios and released in 2012. Dishonored capitalizes on allowing the player to complete various challenges with a great deal of creativity and independence. Meaning you can get through the game using combat, stealth, or your own unique blend of the two.


""Stay behind me and close your eyes. I'll need a minute."" 
Community Created Artwork for Dishonored
By: Burn




-Detailed breakdown review-Story/NarrativeChoice has an impactDishonored's story is advertised as having a great deal of choice, and the levels will change or there will be some effect or impact based on your decisions throughout the game. The steam store itself reads ""The outcome of each mission plays out based on the choices you make.""There is some truth to the statement, the story did change a little bit on my second time through, but it didn't change as drastically as I was expecting. I come with a presupposition that when I hear that ""my choices and actions will effect the game"", I'm expecting something significant to happen.For example: if I spit in little Timmy's Cereal, I would expect little Timmy to dislike me, maybe his father would come after me. If I met Timmy again and I picked up his cereal and threw it across the room, I would hope that Timmy would sick his dog on me, and Timmy would try to attack me with a butter knife.To illustrate the impact of my decisions in Dishonored; if I killed Timmy, there are just going to be a few more rats, security will be tighter, more enemies, and the epilogue MIGHT change slightly change to show I did a bad thing. But unless I kill a lot of Timmy's the game won't notice until much later in the game when things get bad regardless of Timmy killings. All in all, not a great impact.The games that I think of when I think about ""decisions"" and ""choice"" in video games (where your choice leaves an impact) is KOTOR, KOTOR2, and Mass Effect. In those video games Timmy would hire some thugs by spending the small mounts of money he looted off level 3 sewer rats, and your character would have an obvious physical/emotion/spiritual shift because of being a Timmy-hating-monster.The redeeming factor of Dishonored method, is that it doesn't really have as much of an ""ethics"" explanation. The Protagonist is justified in his decisions - or at least VISIBLY justified in his actions. But the epilogue has a clearly ""good"" and ""bad"" ending, even though they're masked through the term ""high chaos"" and ""low chaos"".Story: You play as the Protagonist ""Corvo Attano"", body guard to the Queen. Corvo gets framed for a crime he did not commit, he's given magical powers, and he becomes an assassin. ...Sounds like a normal Friday night to me! As I've already elaborated above, you get to choose how Corvo behaves, whom he kills or helps, and your choices will be reflected in the idle-chatter from the guards, and the number of guards, rats, and ""weepers"". Dishonored takes place in Dunwall, which has been plagued (literally) by disease and rats. The Plague produces zombie-like-creatures known as ""weepers"" whom will wonder around aimlessly and attack on site.


That moment when a game forces you into ""revenge mode"" when they kill your Queen (lover) and kidnap your princess (daughter).

GameplayControls: Mechanically speaking, the game plays and feels exactly how it should, with a keyboard and mouse. I did rebind the attack keys though, because your left click is melee (right hand) and your right click is offhand (which can be magic, fire arm, cross bow, mine, etc, held in the left hand). I would have eventually gotten used to it, but I wanted right click to be right hand, left click to be left hand. And that's what made sense to me. (God bless key rebinding)You can use your number keys, or scroll wheel to switch between the different off-hand weapons you can chose from. You can also click in the scroll wheel which will either pause or slow down time; I couldn't figure out which it did, because I just tried to make my choice asap. Your melee attack never changes, so whenever someone's close you never need to question which button to press or click, or scroll through weapons.There's a lot that can be said about all the different kinds of weapons and magic abilities you can use, a big part of the game is coming up with ways to chain together the different abilities! To give you an idea of my favorite flavor of combat-gameplay: If a game lets me play stealthy, I try to stealth... be it pacifist or killing. the abilities I will chose compliment that play style, so I want mobility, stealth/quiet feet, and being able to detect my foes. (so I used the eye site and teleportation magic skills)I would ninja through the level, (and yes, that's a verb I don't care what you say Merriam-Webster!) but whenever I was caught I would warp around from enemy to enemy, like a mage from World of Warcraft with no cool downs.However, on that note it's important to point out that magic uses a magic resource. I don't think the game ever explained what the resource is called this time... which is just as well; it's blueberry juice, and anyone who tells you differently is a filthy liar. (*mumbles* I guess to restore it you used a ""spiritual remedy"" but that's less funny to mention.) You have ammo, a health bar, mana/blueberryjuice bar, and oxygen bar when underwater.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=713056385Progression: One of my favorite values is ""how do you progress through a game. in Dishonored you progress via upgrades to powers, purchased upgrades/ammo/blueprints with gold, as well as the general progression through the story. There's progression all 'round.Style/Graphics/Appearance: The first word that comes to mind for me is ""steampunk"", but that's not reaaaalllyyyyy the best description of the style. There was some steampunk inspiration, but the architecture and setting was largely influenced by England, and the word is a combination of technology, and magic. (Always a popular choice)Price/value/game time played: Dishonored is priced at $9.99. So far I've played 25 hours of the game. I've had two play-throughs, once getting the ""good"" ending and the other getting the ""bad"" ending. Immediately after my first game I knew I had to play it again and see what other types of outcomes I could experience.Like I've hinted at, I was a bit disappointed because of my overly inflated expectations for what kind of impact I would have with my choices, but the second play through was still extremely valuable and interesting, it turns out I had somehow completely avoided a boss battle on my first play through! That's really impressive in my opinion, and does redeem the aspect of choice somewhat.HOWEVER, that's really one of the few negative things I have to say about the game, as a whole I was extremely satisfied and got a great deal of entertainment out of the game, and will undoubtedly play through it again in the future.Conclusion: to wrap this review up... Great game, all around loved it. I've been on a stealth-game-spree lately, and this game is one of the good ones. There's a great deal of depth in the game, various difficulties, plenty of achievements, a fair bit of replay ability to keep people interested in playing through the game.I feel like this game will appeal the most to stealth game enthusiasts, (not sure about the hard-core-stealth-game-crowd, It's recently come to my attention I'm no where near as good as those people.) But the game can appeal to people who mainly play FPS or slashy mc stab stab styled games. There's a nice mix of genre's in this game to appeal to a very large demographic of gamers.Now is especially a good time to get and play through Dishonored, because Dishonored 2 cometh! -- As always, thanks for reading my review!

God daaamn this game is beautiful..Dishonored is, without a doubt the greatest game i've ever played in my life and i've played plenty let me tell you.Everything about this game is beautiful, it just makes me feel some kind of way.Let's start with my Overall score. It is without a doubt a 10/10. Whoever has played this game from start to finish will tell you the same.I finished the main campaign about a year ago, it took me about 8 hours to complete. Dishonored 2 will come out this year so i thought that now is a good time to replay the first game just to get a feel for it. and boy got i hooked.. huh i've played the game on the hardest difficulty and tried my best to get the highest achievements but in the end it didn't work out for me. I guess i need to practice alot more. some people might say it's a short game, the campaign that is, and i agree. but it's not Easy by any means. you will do whatever it takes just to finish the game without even killing 1 enemy. without even being seen 1 time. Its crazy. I mean so what if the game is only 8-9 hours, with the DLC pack it will add another 9 hours so you have a solid ~20 hours of fun with the game. Thats alot for a game that costs like 5 euros on sale right? anyway i'm not gonna bore you- the world, the lore, the art direction, the gameplay...is just so well done that it makes you wish you lived in that world.You play as Corvo, an ex-bodyguard that is accused and imprisoned falsly by a corrupt government. When you get to play as him he will be a super-assassin. choking biches left and right :D you can choose how you want to play the game, you can either play it as a silent shadow without being seen, or you could go full rampage and loud. I prefer the silent gameplay just because it's more challenging and FUN in my opinion.your actions in the game have consequences, meaning that you will get a different ending if you play it silent, or loud. which in my opinion adds a very nice touch to the game. Once again you should OWN this game in your steam library, i only wish i had known it was this good earlier. and i will keep on playing until i get the Clean Hands & Ghost Achievements.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSthat one mission you get to play as Daud and your assassins get caught by the overseer soldiers made me so emotional. I can never play that mission without killing the soldiers, not that i can't, i just don't want to. I feel responsible for them and i want to kill whoever lays hands on my babies. The wise thing to do is to play as a ghost but♥♥♥♥♥that i won't keep silence, im a master assassin.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSGET THIS GAME ASAP			"

												I love this game so much that even after taking close to 50 hours to finish the main campaign, I wished the game was a bit longer, just so I could spend some more time immersed in the world of Dunwall. It's a beautiful game that I simply couldn't get enough of. GraphicsWhen someone mentions artistic games, they most likely are talking about indie games such as Firewatch. In fact, some might even frown upon anyone mentioning a AAA title. So it might surprise some people when I say that Dishonored is one of the most artistic games I have ever laid my eyes on. You can take screenshot of almost any place in the game and it would look like a beautiful oil painting, even when Dunwall is a dark and dreary place to be in, infested with rats and plague. Its atmospheric look evokes a sense of mystery and suspense. The world is so well done that I wanted to learn the history of the city. When, say, I passed by an abandoned building, I wondered about the people who used to live there. That is how well done Dunwall is, pardon the pun. I was so immersed in it that it felt real. It made me curious. I wanted to know more. I wish they written novels about Dunwall. I would definitely read it. There is plenty of lore, if you're interested in it, to learn the backstories of some of the characters, and places. But I wished there were more. GameplayLot of people love to look down on AAA games for being violent and crass and shower praise on indie titles such as Undertale for going the opposite route. ""You can finish the game without killing anyone"", they would say. Well, guess what? In Dishonored, you can finish the entire game without killing anyone too! In fact that's encouraged. And there is an achievement if you happen to not kill a single person in the game. And it's not easy not to kill. The game makes you work for it. Sometimes killing is so tempting. Especially because, in this game, apart from your regular weapons such as the sword and gun and crossbow, you also get special abilities such as super vision, ability to stop time, ability to possess other people etc.  If you don't mind a darker ending, you can unleash all your powers on your enemies. But the game rewards you with a better, brighter, more positive ending if you exercise restraint.  StoryDishonored has a decent main story plus lots of interesting side stories. There are a lot of literature lying around in the world for you to read to discover the back stories of the places and the people. That makes the game even more immersive. You can even ignore all of it if you want, even though I wouldn't recommend it. All in all this is a great game and it's a must play for anyone who loves playing immersive games.			"

Dystopian Neo-London Hitman with super powers.Teleport and transform into a rat to crawl through a vent or posess someone and walk pass the security gates. The developers put so much effort into giving the player dozens of combinations to tackle each level.Like a genius I just teleport over everything because I'm an adult and I demand prudence. If you walk into someone hostile don't be afraid to put one between his eyes instantly. Just don't make it a habit. You're so overpowered the least you can do is -try- to not kill these bots.			"

												Dishonored is an insantly good game. It's a great combination of Deus Ex and Thief with an emphasis on magic and some great style. The world they've built is cool as hell and the lore is actually worth getting invested in. Levels are open ended and the gameplay encourages experimentation be it going violent, going nonlethal, or never engaging at all with multiple ways of completing any objective. Dishonored is fantastic.As for the DLC, the trials are kind of whatever but Knife of Dunwall and Brigamore WItches shouldn't be missed as they're lengthy campaigns that set up Dishonored 2 really well.

												Dishonored in quite possibly the most innovative and enjoyable single player game I've played since I was a kid. Why?Corvo, the empresses bodyguard turned ""Assassin"" by a group of loyalists that wish to put Emily, the late empresses daughter, in charge of the kingdom. How you do that however is compleatly up to you.You will get missions to go Eliminate targets and you can do this by Killing them or ""Removing"" them if you are the ""I can't be bothered to use stealth!"" type of person you can run in there willy nilly and stab your target or you can be more creative. Poison, choking them out and throwing them into a pack of hungry rats, or using your magic to send them to the moon Or on the flipside, you're the type of person that likes stealth and to be as non-leathel as possible you can find alternitive means to eliminating your targets.The way you play greatly affects the outcome of the storyThis game is increadibly innovative. Good line of sight on guards, fun and interesting ways to kill and neutrilize people, amazing story with charaters you get attached to, combat that makes you think of how you're going to tackle groups of enemies, whilst still being a challenge to the player.So far I've played this game through to the end 3 times and every playthrough has been different.If you're browsing through steam for a good game to play at a reasonable price, £7.99 at the time of writing this, I highly recomend this game.

												Dishonored is a great game both story and gameplay wise. It allows you to approach every mission very creatively and this allows you to challenge yourself with multiple difficulty options such as having the option to just use the starting equipment and never getting powers apart from Blink. Because of these options Dishonored has masses of replay value and has a wide selection of choices with different tactics that are rewarded with spacious environments riddled with pathways and secrets.Unfortunately Dishonored isn't perfect with the stilted voice work and animation and the lack of stealth options that gets beaten out by action gameplay even though it encourages stealth to get the good ending. Dishonored may have flaws, but they are outweighed by the beautiful atmosphere and openness of the level structure and won't cause massive damage to what is a fantastic game.			"

												I am only a couple of hours in the game at the time I write this, but my impression of this game so far is very good. The graphic design is very nicely done and feels immersive. The overal game mechanics are solid and the UI works like a charm (good port). So far Iam not really sucked into the story yet, but thats not a big deal, I am having to much fun with sneaking around and exploring :)The gameplay feels like a hybrid between Fallout, Deus Ex and Bioshock. If you like these type of games then this is a recommended game for you.edit: typos			"

												Goddammit, I promised this one a LONG time ago and now with my vacations, I can actually put some love into this one. [Thanks to HateBreeder for the reminder ;)].Anyways... Dishonored went under my radar because 1) It looked like it was sh*t; and 2) The moral choice didn't encourage me to buy it at all (which I will explain why later).It's hard at all to give a good premise to a game and Dishonored gets it half well and half badly: The lore is great, you have an Empress who rules Dunwall with it's lords and assistants, a very... steampunk-ish city where the plague infects everything and everyone. Everything feels depressing and everyone just ♥♥♥♥♥es about how they are sad and hate life and lifes hates them.The game succeeds in putting you in Corvo Attano's shoes (the protagonist), a guard for the empress who, right off the bat is accused to murdering the Empress, that moment.. sucked! It was so stupid as to how Corvo (he can't ♥♥♥♥ing talk!!) didn't say a word, he just stood there while everyone said ""TRAITOR!"" or ""MURDERER!"". It totally breaks from his character and the immersion of the world. Sadly... Dunwall falls flat as well with all this:Dunwall doesn't have character! (I know, it sounds weird...) It all sums up to you finding a dead body somewhere with a suicide letter because their wife or girlfriend or sister or mother and/or whatever died because of the plague!It shoves depression down your throat every. Single. ♥♥♥♥ing. Time! It's not appealing! It needed (not much, but at least a little bit of) life or joy somewhere, hell! Even the mission at the party is ♥♥♥♥ing depressing in groundbreaking levels of depression!The Steampunk city could also be better described, like how some stuff works for the curious, I mean, how the robot patriots work, among other technologically interesting stuff! Cities like Bioshock Infinite's Columbia is miles away better than Dunwall, it made a great contrast between the superficial perfection of Columbia and the deeper depressing and violent Columbia, while explaining cool stuff you might be wondering (Like how a beach and it's ocean work in a city in the SKY! (yes, that is explained!) Dunwall is just... a background! It could've been a daylight version of Point Lookout, Maryland from Fallout 3 without the skreekers and the Ferals and it would have had the same ♥♥♥♥ing impact!)Whale Oil isn't giving the city ""a deeper layer of character"" like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reviewers like IGN claim.Anyway, after you are arrested 40 minutes into the game, you get introduced into the the very first of 2 major plot twists in the game's story, which I won't say what it is about, and after that, the story starts as it should, a nice vendetta-style story that isn't as good as The Darkness 2 but gets the job done to motivate you into every mission. It really does motivate you, but more because of:-The level design: it's very varied throughout the 9 missions you get (I sadly do not own any DLC, though I plan of getting them in the (unclear) future). Every character you will kill has it's own... massive property and surroundings. This helps give you a feel of size that Dunwall has instead of just... background! The levels were clearly well thought out and, honestly, seem to be the best part of the game and the main reason I played this game twice and still intend in doing a 3rd playthrough.The charm also comes from the gameplay: it's probably one of the best gameplay systems ever made, ever! It feels unbelievably fluid, how you can run and dodge everything while blinking ANYWHERE (real ♥♥♥♥ing level design, THIEF 2014!, you know why? Because when I actually say ""anywhere"" I mean A-N-Y-W-H-E-R-E!). It's amazing, it truly is! If you think, ""Oh, a roof... I wish I could go there are escape that ""wall of light"" (a shield barrier than instantly kills you in the game), well, welcome to dishonored, where you can actually go through that roof or sewer or door or anything! Kudos to Arkane!The peek system is a bit OP though... by pressing Q (lean/peek right) or E (lean/peek left), you can see what's on the right of the box you're hiding behind, HOWEVER, no one can see you while you are in lean mechanic! (Except guards on the side or behind you, of course. But the ones in front of you, just can't see you, even like 50 centimetres in front of you). It makes the game a tad easy, especially for me, who breezed through the game in both Hard and Very Hard (2 hardest difficulties), completing every side and main quest, which is, I admit, a bit... weird, I wanted a bigger challenge, like DX: Human Revolution provided effectively!The story is good overall except for the stupid moral decision where: - Kill much? = Bad ending- Oh, you play like the Pope would play? = Good EndingIt's not well thought out, because killing is the funnest way of playing! Because guess how many of your skills (magic powers) are lethal focused? Yep, 70% of them! SO, for stealth purists who prefer knocking out the guards, you will end the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with like 15 runes to spend BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MORE NON-LETHAL BASED SKILLS!They focus the skills in killing when the story prefers a non-lethal playthrough! It makes little sense though stealth is still really fun nevertheless!Both styles of play are fun, but the skills focus on combat when they should be more split between lethal and non-lethal. Also, there are many gadgets (grenades, spikes, crossbows, pistols, etc.), right now I am thinking 1 only thing that is useful for NON-LETHAL! Which is the sleep dart for the crossbow. ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME? It's not very balanced between the 2 styles and it looks like it has a massive identity crisis between which style of play it wants to focus on...Lastly: The graphics! Textures on High are muddy, though they feel intentional, and with a reason: a painting in motion! It looks like it to be honest, like one of those water paiting from Van Gogh. The style is colourful which sadly, contradicts AGAIN with it's feel. If it feels depressing and the game wants to give us a deep sense of sadness and pity, then why so many vibrant colours?!Graphics get a ""good"" from me though because forgetting these weird... stuff the devs put in the game, this is still one of my personal Games of the Year 2012 and from now on, my favorite stealth game of ALL TIME, thanks to it's incredible level design and remarkably fluid and perfect gameplay! It's from now on my main basis of comparison. Every stealth game coming soon will be compared to dishonored before my purchase. That being said, why do you think I haven't bought Thief 2014 yet? Exactly...Nevertheless, these ""small (on the story/writing/non-gameplay issues part) but big (as a whole)"" problems will affect the score, which made me think of what to to give this really good game (a 7.5/10). But from a gameplay standpoint it's really sweet, the level design is superb and the story pretty cool overall (despite the (clearly) rushed ending, that still worked I suppose), making it from now on a stealth game model to follow! 9/10 is the other number is my mind.Whichever score you focus your eyes, on, Dishonored deserves nothing more than your hard-earned cash. It easily one on the best games on this last decade because of how well it nailed level design and gameplay fluidity and efectiveness, making a ""boring genre"" to some people (the stealth genre) into a (somewhat) fun and fast paced game, and that's remarkable is so many standpoints, that I still have a feeling of going back and get into a 3rd playthrough and even buy the praised DLC's.Such a gem to be honest. Sad I didn't buy it earlier. Still, best 7,49€ I spent in months.			"

												This game's artistic style is a mix of Thief 1+2 and BioShock. Of course I liked it, is that even a question? I also commend the game designers for successfully creating a game that was equally fun playing either fully stealth or mass murdering everyone. Unlike Garrett, Corvo is fully capable of fighting guardsmen head-on and there are all sorts of weapons that make it fun, interesting, and satisfying the entire time. On the other hand, if you choose to go stealthy there are lots of little conversations to overhear that further add to the fantastic amount of world-building. You really can't go wrong here playing either way, though I'd recommend picking one style and sticking with it.This game has a lot more Thief-y feel than the actual sequel Thief (2014) did. It's a real shame that game turned out to be what it was. Unsurprisingly, I discovered that there's some overlap between the production staffs for the original Thief games and this one. The blood will tell, as they say.			"

												A wondefully crafted story. You are a bodyguard hired to protect Queen Victoria of England from the Black Plague, but when Budd from Kill Bill murders her, you are framed for it. After escaping prison, you systematically assassinate everyone in the entire city to prove that you're not a deranged killer. Then you wake up in the boat from Willy Wonka on the choclate river, but you ate way too much choclate, so the Oompa Loompas bring to Budd and he takes all your stuff. You get really mad at him for that, so you kill him too, and then you're done. Oh, and there's some subplot about rescuing a girl or somethnig, but that's not important.			"

												A unique and awesome action game created by Arkane Studios! It definitely fits every gamer's profile since you can acomplish every single mission by your own personal way. You can either be stealthy or you can unleash Ragnarok to everything and everyone. As a fan of stealth games and stealth style in general, I have to admit that they did a fine job with this one. The moves, the compact and fight style and mechanisms...everything was designed with great accuracy! Last but not least, I must also give my respects to the game's storyline and its environment which actually ROCKED.  A perfect example of how stealth games should be designed!I give this game 9/10 "

												I bought it in the December 2016 Steam Winter Sale, and I personally had fun. I enjoyed that you have such limitless options to take down your enemies, and to be able to complete the game with different playstyles really adds to the challenge and the replayability to the game. This game, depending on how well you use your abilities and skills, will either be easy or complete madness, and I love it. The base game is decent length wise (I beat it in under 10 hours), but it is really satisfying in the end. Even though I got this game on sale, I would buy it at full price anyway; it's that worth it.			"

												Fantastic!  This game had it all.1. Rich lore and world building from the start.  I loved the care taken to explain the whale oil economy, scrimshaw,  and debaucherous holidays.  Take a moment to read the tomes and notes scattered around, they go a long way toward building a fleshed out breathing world.  Pointing the ""heart' at someone can sometimes gives you insight on someone's true nature or simply tell you that their family has been taken by the plague.  Good stuff.2. A myriad of creative ways to execute and incapacitate your foes.Dishonored offers you a dozen tools that can be combined for a rewarding combat experience.  Lay razorwire traps on alarms, fire your gun in the air to alert the guards and watch as they get shredded when they reach for that alarm button.  Possess guards to remove explosive whale oil barrels, drop the barrel in a group of enemies and then fire an explosive crossbow bolt from your hidden position.  If anyone survives, summon a swarm of carnivorous rats to finish them off or let them dispose of the bodies and erase any trace of your dirty work.3.  Great level design and layout.Run across rooftops, jump through windows or duck into sewers, under tables, hide atop rafters.  Most areas are accessible and allow you to go through or around your enemy.   The setting is a city in economic and social decay but is still quite beautiful.I loved this game from start to finish and wish I hadn't passed it over for so many years.  10/10 would search through Lady Boyle's panty drawers again.

												Overall, it's like the stealth version of BioShock. Dishonored is heavily based on stealthy approach to complete the missions and you'll be given a lot of choices to determine the outcome of your current mission's story, the other character's dialogue and behavior, plus the ending.  Like BioShock, you'll have a weapon (unlike BioShock, sword only) on your right hand and multiple tools on your left hand, both controllable individually. The difference is, Dishonored has way less choices of supernatural powers and weapons. The combat only focuses on melee combat even you're given a flintlock-like pistol and a crossbow as a ranged weapon.Here's the goods and the bads of the game:Pros:+ Another beautifully written story for a video game+ Challenging combat. you are not extremely OP like in most other games, but also not awkwardly animated like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare's sword fight+ Your actions and decisions will decide the outcome of the story+ Supernatural powers, even though it's very limited (new powers for the DLC campaign) but it's still very fun to use. Just like BioShock, you hold the magic power on your left hand while your right hand will hold a weapon (in this case, sword only)+ A lot of choices to complete your missions. Different approaches are available each with their own consequences and benefits.+ DLC is also pretty good, telling a story that's happening on the other side with a character that will eventually meet your main character on the main story. If you like challenges, one of the DLC offers a complete set of challenges that will test your in-game combat, stealth, and agility skill.+ Enemy types varies just like Assassin's Creed even though the enemies in Dishonored don't have any weaknesses that can be exploited.+ Collectibles, hidden objects to power up, hidden rooms, etc. If you love those kind of things, this game's totally for you. Mostly, you'll have to sniff around and explore almost every corner of the map in order to level up your powers properly.+ Pretty good graphics, but not great.Cons:- Horrible character graphics, they only have very limited models plus lack of details sometimes make it very obvious that a lot of duplicates are walking around.- Story outcome solely based on your capability to stealth. A stealthy and merciful playstyle will save the entire kingdom while aggressive and murderous playstyle will throw the kingdom into a deeper pit of chaos since all your actions will be taken example of by the upcoming Empress.- Kills are limited on every level (around 15 each mission if you want a good outcome) which makes this game pretty weird. An assassin who is not allowed to kill anyone, seriously? You must use non-lethal weapons if your stealth fails and stuck in inescapable conflict.- I'm no fan of finding hidden objects which are usually very far and way too tedious to find it and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Lack of power upgrades will make stealth much harder.- Some maps are confusing, especially the Brigmore house in the DLC- Sword range is weird, the animation won't show the sword reaches you but you will still get hit. Sword blocks sometime fail to work during this time.TL;DR If you like BioShock, you'll like this game. It's almost the same thing, just much more limited weaponry and choices. But if you hate stealth games, don't buy this game. It is solely based on stealth, nothing more. "

												It's disheartening to see how Arkane Studios appears to be the only developer still around which has the necessary skills to take usually overlooked vertical exploration and rich level design to such a, pardon the pun, high degree. So much so they can rightfully be placed at the very essence of Dishonored which revels and is at its best when it lets you explore the extremely well designed world of Dunwall which absolutely oozes atmosphere and character at every corner, but is sadly diminished by its poorly constructed and even worse, poorly executed narrative of the main story which leads to unsatisfying revelations and tacked on abrupt ending not redeemed in the least by an epilogue. This carries over to characters and their own stories which end up being very forgettable and merely serving a purpose.Things are just as conflicted in the gameplay department where game offers multiple ways to go about your bloody business, but then proceeds to hamstring your stealth approach with very limited arsenal of tools at your disposal, at least compared to a more violent route which gives you much more freedom and utility. There are also customary problems associated with stealth AI detection and rats getting in the way of devouring your unconscious enemies which leads to some no kill failure states. Some of the non-violent target solutions could've also used a bit more challenge and less contrivance in some cases, but it's nothing worth writing a paragraph about and can be waved away.In the end Dishonored is a widely uneven game, but one who's faults fail to overshadow the positives in the grand scheme of things. Shame I didn't get to tackle the DLC, but it's something for the future because Dishonored is most certainly worthy of replaying.			"

												This is a wonderful game. Whether you want to hack and slash your way to victory or hide in the shadows is up to you. Whether you want to utilize the supernatural powers given to you to achieve your goals, or just stick to flesh and steel is up to you. The game will flow how you want it to flow. Your decisions and actions have consequences that you will notice later on in the story; in which is very immersive. The simple story and lore behind this game is amazing. There's so much to borrow from this game in the event that you want to create something of your own because it is so damn unique - nothing like it. The ways of life and the general environment of Dunwall is so bizzare that it is interesting. You can't quite slap a label on it and have that label be accurate, because it's something of its own and not just something crafted after a specific category.You have the ability to go through the storyline as many times as you like. There may be something you missed the last time, or just a new way to go about completing it that you did not do before. All up to you, bud.Seriously, though. Buy the game and all its DLC.			"

												This game is one of the most gripping and intelligently crafted games that  I have had the pleasure of playing it kept me playing  and offered me freedom of how i were to complete each mission thus adding replay value the only bad thing i can pick out about this game is that in only took me 11hrs to complete,However buy the dlc's and you may find your self playing a while longer,the story is masterful and will keep you asking yourself.. what next ..whats gonna happen next.these types of things are what makes a game good,and deters away from that feeling of unsureness as to whether or not to bother playing . the stealth system in this game is beyond amazing as it opens up countless ways to engage onto your enemy and coutless ways to go about completeting the gameAnother great things about this game is the multiple endings this is good for hardcore gamers who want to experience everything the game has to offer ;it offers a somewhat effective +for replayability. Overall i rate this game a  9.5/10 as everything is perfect in this game except the time it takes to complete the base gameDefinetly try and buy this game			"

												Dishonored: The eternal hunger for power.Gameplay : The gameplay that Dishonored offers is brilliant. While the story may not seem very long ( especially if you ""rush"" it ) the possibilities of playing it are endless. The gameplay seems always fresh and innovative even if you play the game more than once.Soundtrack : The soundtrack is normal but it is immersive.There is nothing that really stands out in the soundtrack other than the sounds that are well worked and contribute to the ""immersivity"" factor.Story : The story is really original and I think that explores the seek / hunger for power that mankind tends to be born with. Original and well written. A++Graphics : The graphics are absolutely astonishing even for a 2012  game . Despite the fact that they are already outdated ( sort off) some views are magnificent and the theme of the game makes them unique.9/10 "

												I highly recommend this game.Firstly to lovers of the gendre, but really, if you want to try a good stealth game that will challenge your skill and intelligence, you must try Dishonored.At the eve of Dishonored 2 I believed it was high time to give this acclaimed gem a try. And I must say I was not disapointed.Don't get me wrong, all games have their flaws, but Dishonored has the rare quality of having very few of those.To me the negative points never surpassed the positive ones, or I wouldn't have played the game in full :)Before I go into specifics please keep in mind this is my own personal opinion.What did I like?+ The story + The characters + The graphics + The artwork + The challenging missions+ The world + The non kill option+ The longevity + The powersWhat did I dislike?- The ambiance- The rats- The unbalanced game style- The extreme demands of stealth mode- The clichés - The absence of a radar - The dark vision powerMore details on those positive points:While Dishonored doesn't have the most original storyline it still has enough plot and twists to it to keep you firmly seated at you PC screen. But the main atraction is it's gameplay.The main character may be silent, but all those around him help to build a world full in variety, color and depth. The other characters all have their stories and secrets, you don't spend much of the game speaking to anyone, but the use of a particular item will tell you much more. Abuse it, it's worth it! But don't worry, the game won't provide any spoilers. :)The graphics have some good textures and shapes, very correct and respectful of the standards of 2012 frankly still looks great today. A pity the world of Dishonored looks so static at times. The character motions also leave a bit to be desired but nothing major.The actual artwork (on paper) is very good in my opinion but it doesn't fully translate into the game. However, the somber clothing and hairstyles totally respect the game world. As well as the angular faces, a look I wasn't familiar with but which I enjoyed in the end, plus beautifull scenarios to enjoy at times from the rooftops during sunset.The game is non-linear in it's gameplay, all paths lead to rome true but there are many of them. One mission goal equals at least 5 ways to go about it. Depending on whether you prefer to go unseen, or wish to cause as much 'chaos' as possible. The game will measure how much of a mess you made and Will punish you for it.It's dificult to create an original world in which to place your characters, this game studio found a clever mix between steampunk and broken utopia, very original. Hint, read all books.As mentioned briefly before, there are two ways to play this game, kill or not kill, each with it's dificulties and rewards. Naturally it's never so simple. You will obtain achievements for killing all, for killing some, for killing Only some and killing none. Even the bosses! Which is a much apreciated novelty! One important distinction to learn early on? Ghost and Shadow. You can not get seen and can not kill, or you can not get seen while still going for the kill.Naturally, one playthrough won't be enough, which, is another positive point!Me, I took over 41 hours thus far. Reduce that by half if you're an expert in stealth games. :)The abilities or powers awarded the players are frankly a breath of fresh air. Blink gives you so many original and cool ways to get about, and Dark Vision is pratically indispensible!The rest? Well, that depends on how you wish to play the game, and I won't ruin it for you. But note that collecting certain items will be essential for acquiring those powers. Rather than a nuisance it will help you know your misions levels all the better.More details on the negative points:Dishonored is dark, in more ways than one. There are no rosy cheeked kids no puppies and no flowers. Of course it was integral to the game, but you can only stomach so much disease and death, regarless of the cold truth it depicts.Rats? Why rats? Distasteful to say the least. You best not suffer from this particular phobia or you Won't be able to play the game. On a slightly happier note those are one of two things you Can kill without saction.Killing is the fastest way, stealth becomes madatory later on however, so you can either be very patient or triger happy, the game takes into account both choices and delivers it's consequences. But I can't help but feel that those who choose 'kill' are hindered more than the non-kill, more rats for one, more agressif 'people' on the streets, more security and guards.Stealth much? Knock out a guard, hide him in a dark corner for fear of discovery, need to do the same with the guard dogs for another dog will go on alert at the sight of it's sleeping canine friend, and careful where you place your sleeping beauties for someone on the below floor may hear you! But by all means slash your weapon at the back of your unsuspecting victim at two feet he won't hear a thing... logic is not Dishonored's strong point.Did you say 'cliché'? As I said before, the story is not the most original but some events might have you griding your teeth. I can't say much more without spoiling the game.You must unlock a power to see through walls (Dark vision), but the game offers you an achievement reward if you don't get it, hmmm... but if you have no radar to begin with this game becomes a tremendous headache without it.Can it be done? Yes. Is it worth the headache for one achievement? No thanks.And speaking of Dark vision, yellow... why yellow and why do their eyes need to glow like flashlights?I could go on about it at lenght, but I think each futur player of Dishonored should focus on what good they can take from the game and from there pick out what they like the most and the least.Especially since this Is a good game and a game worth playing at least once in your gamer life. Like many rare pearls out there Dishonored has earned it's place in legend.Enjoy your game!Kind regards,Keiyan			"

												This is a review for Dishonored: Game of the Year Edition, that means the review takes in account of the dlc's as well.This game was definitely one of most entertaining games I've played. Being one of the few first person stealth games, the control are very smooth and Skyrim-like. I would say the game is worth every penny, but due to some pros and cons, players generally like or dislike this game, I'll suggest you either rent or buy this game while it's on sale if you're ""unsure"".First, I'm going to cover the background info. The game takes place in a steam punk era, where magic and technology exists together. The main campaign goes something like this, you're the royal bodyguard who came back a bit earlier than expected. Being wrong place at wrong time, you were framed after witnessing your queen getting assassinated and the princess getting kidnapped. The main plot is essentially very straight-forward, linear and a bit predictable. So readers be warned, don't expect Mass Effect level of plot. However, while the main plot is not extremely good, it's not bad either. What makes the plot however, really highlighted and up high on the scale is when you play the DLC's, where you get to play as the master assassin Daud, who's story takes place after his murder of the queen. The DLC's are fairly lengthy and I have to say, for me it was very interesting the way the plot weaves along with the main campaign, so if you consider getting this game, definitely pick up the DLC's or the GOTY edition.The game mechanics is what really kicks this game up high for me. You get variety of abilities such as teleporting, freezing time and even possess your enemies to sneak past security. With the amount of weapons and abilities, you have a bucket load of ways to enjoy the game, rather it is to sneak past enemies or to fight them straight up. Here's however, in my opinion where the main flaw for me came in. The game uses a system called chaos system. Based on the amount of enemies you've killed, you either end up with a high chaos or low chaos endings along with some effects on certain missions. I played through my main campaign on low chaos, and I've seen the high chaos ending as well. Honestly, I would highly suggest you to play the way you would play on any assassin games, don't worry about how you eliminate your targets, you will end up getting the most fun out of the game by trying out all the gadgets. Also, the ending is not different by much.Graphic: 7/10Explanation: The graphics uses the unreal engine, it was intended to have a comic and more Borderlands feel to it rather than realistic. I enjoyed the graphics as it combined with the game atmosphere very well, but it's certainly not the ""high-end-best"" graphics.Plot: 8/10Explanation: You may be a little bit confused about my plot scoring, originally I was going to give the plot a 6/10 after playing through the main story, but since the DLC's really pack a punch and connects with the main plot, I felt the need to give it a higher score of 8 out of 10. Keep in mind for Open World RPG players, this game does not have as much side missions as you would expect, most side missions revolve around the main mission. Providing you with alternative ways to approach targets or reward you with new abilities.Gameplay: 8.5/10Explanation: The gameplay is absolutely amazing in ways, your abilities are very awesome, and overpowered at the same time, I however, was not looking for difficulty but rather enjoying the game the way it is. But for you hardcore gamers out there, there's options for higher difficulties. Players that choose to be pacifist or run the game on low chaos will end up limiting themselves over the usage of tools, making it less enjoying than when playing the game on high chaos. But rewarding in ways as well.Replayability: 6/10Explanation: There are some challenges in the DLC's such as the Time Bend Massacre, where you go through many rounds to try and murder people as many as possible with the time frozen for a limited amount of time. This I can see as being fairly enjoyable, but aside from this, maybe another run-through just to see the alternative chaos ending, I would not hold this game high on replability.Overall: 8/10Conclusion: Great game, definitely a steal when you buy it on sale, fairly reasonable price at it's full as well. If you enjoy casual, stealth, first person killing games, you would get a lot of out of this game. The game is pretty linear and fast pace, so no grinding or the need to feel dragged. A good game worth picking up when you want a new game.			"

You have different abilities,from teleporting to summon rats as your minions.You've got 3 different weapons,a sword,a gun,and a crossbow.You can upgrade your weapons,give them different bullets to use.You can also use grenades.I loved every single moment of this game.the way it gives you the option to deal with your quests exactly as you want.I would love to see a prequel,yes,a prequel.a background story of Corvo.Story : 8/10Gameplay : 10/10Graphics : 8/10Sound :9/10Conclusion : 8,75/10  "

												If you can buy one game in 2012, it should be Dishonored. From production to its ingenious gameplay, Arkhane Studios' title is outstanding, with its multiple references to many games such as Deus Ex, Thief, Bioshock or Half Life 2. It's simple, Dishonored is a 2-in-1 game you can finish either with violence and lots of action sequences, or with discretion, applying stealth strategies to kill your enemies without being seen.

												One of the best games ive ever played. A 1st person action stealth game with some of the most creative and fun combat mechanics. Each mission can be done in a lethal way or a non lethal way and changes the way the game plays out. This game is not open world but has alot of exploration you can put into it. Some things that some people including me didn't like about this game was how short it is. But this game has great replay value, you can challenge yourself to finish the game in many different ways. You can finish the game in low chaos, high chaos, buying no powers and even not killing anyone or alerting anyone. You can also get achievements for finishing the game in some of these ways which I know some people enjoy getting including me. I think anyone could enjoy this game beacasue you can play it anyway you want!			"

												Brilliant game. I have played about 27 hours and all I can say is... holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ The gameplay is so well made, the story is exciting but easy to understand, the voice actors are brilliant and the music is great. This game is certainly the best stealth / FPS (steampunk) game that has been made.The sad part of this game is that the story is very short and there is not so many easy choices between killing or not killing the enemies, and the surroundings are quite limited.But otherwise, Arkane Studios have really made an awesome game doing all the right design decisions.- 11/10			"

There is always a new thing you can try, there is always a different way to combine your powers in a way you never though of. Of all the games that gives you powers like Bioshock, Deus Ex, etc, this is one of the very few  which allows you to combine the powers in an organic fashion. Making the replayability of this game incredible.			"

												Excellent game all around - no need for me to use ink here on talking about what makes the game good. Well it just works and looks good and so on... Instead i want to point out how to get the most out of this game. To do that i  STRONGLY advise to not go after the 'Clean Hands' achievement unless you really like to do things the hard way. (Clean Hands = Dont kill anyone in the game) To contradict what i just said i must also say a 'no-kill' game by avoid killing as much is  also a strong recommendation for first playtrough... just dont try do the Clean Hands which is 100% clean game as that is a serious source of frusttration. Now if you do a 'no-kill' game you will be getting used to the load/save screen a lot anyways but completing the game without accidentally killing anyone is just a mess. Better keep a very large library of saves as you will need to backtrack sooner or later. I was very careful but hilarious (well not at the time) game bugs was a big problem. Here is some methods i used to 'kill' someone that i can remember: - Dropping a unconsious guard near a brick wall so that the foot of the guard got stuck on the wall. Nothing big there, happens all the time. But as i was about to leave the place the body jumped up and - fell down a level as i was on the roof. Guard died. - There was once 2 guard pile near a railing. Some pipes below. Apparently putting a 3 guard in the pile made the guy at the bottom to 'zip out' like a toothpaste tube being pressed and then....he fell down. a couple of meters. and died. Didnt even notice it at first so a reload time it was later  (That 'unconsious' text is your friend when checking if people are still alive - at least before you get the turn to ash -ability. Which in turn is only usefull if you actually see the guard dying)- I took out a guard on a long set of stairs. Guard slowly started to drift down the stairs slooooowly accelerating it's speed and... you guessed it. At one point the speed got too fast and guard died. Needless to say i was only able to see this after i left the place and i just happened to turn around and use the vision at the time. - Leave a body on the ground and a pack of roaming rats find it. And you killed the guard of course when things do go bad.  Logical yes, but it is troublesome again as the rat packs form up and roam independently so unless you are nearby to see it then they can 'stealth' kill a body.  Things like this is what makes this achievement annoying as hell. Not impossible no, but for me the annoyance factor got so bad it easily made a 9/10 game to just 7/10. But it was my own fault for trying to get achievements that dont matter. So a word of advice: play the game as nonlethally as possible - it is definitely worth it as there are some VERY devious ways to achieve main objectives with added satisfaction but skip the clean hands BS.

												This is an absolutely fantastic game. It is undoubtedly the best stealth game I have ever played. Its replay value is great; if you wish to kill everyone, you can do that, and the next time you play the game, you can play non-lethally, killing nobody.The DLC is incredible. Playing the downloadable content is like playing brand new games.The only problems I have with this game are the repetitive guard dialogue and frequent trivial errors in the subtitles, but other than that,  this is a great game with lots of replay value.

Get the feeling of agility, power, stealth and more in: ASSASSIN SIMULATOR 2012 A.K.A DISHONOREDOk, at first I bought this game because, you know, assassins. BUT the more I played like an assassin killing everyone the more I saw negative repercussions on Dunwall, I turned half town into zombies and the cops all hated me and that really didn't help my case of being ""innocent"". In other words: an assassin game that made me not want to kill my marks! I love this game, it's made for multiple playthroughs with multiple styles: from a completley ghost-no-casualties style to an all out no-one leaves-here-alive style. Awesome. That's what you typically expect from assassin games, yes, but you can also just stealth along every mission without as much as interacting with any of the guards (be it choking or killing them), so: Stealth!ALSO, remember how playing the no-killing game is always tedious for everyone and you just do it for the bonuses in stealth games? NOT HERE! At least not for me anyways, you get awesome options that every stealth game should have (looking at you DE:HR) where you can choke someone to faint in the middle of a square, carry the body, blink the hell out of there onto a roof, leave him there and keep on doing that until you've passivley cleared the area!You can either go like a normal assassin or use these incredible powers granted to you, there's even an achievment for not upgrading any power but blink, which is really the only thing I almost always use, though really why you wouldn't want to use these powers (if you want to play like a normal assassin) is beyond me since ""falling out of the sky and slitting a guys throat to watch him turn into ashes while his partner is just about to turn around only to see nothing since you blinked away"" is incredibly satisfying to do.Now, granted, this game isn't for everyone, people who like action games probably won't like it a lot, it has a block and counter combat system that I've never really tried out since the intro because I never even get caught, but still, no idea how that would work. Also, I think it has a [necessary] flaw with the NPC detection (at least in normal) where you can have a dude watching a hall and a patrol whom you kill at the end of it and even though any normal human being would see that he for some reason does not, but that is all forgiven thanks to the ability to climb on top of freaking lamps and s**t!. Just, awesome.But enough of me fanboying-out, yes, this has become on of my favourite games, and yes I love it and it's characters, with a good enough consecuence system (better than Skyrims that's for sure) and an awesome concept and lore (if you read the books and pay attention to the places you visit, there is a lot of it) you'll surely like this game.9.9/10 If only because it can get tedious to get some achievments since the missions can be rather lengthy, especially for a ghost-&-no-deaths playthrough and such, but I'd still say you should buy the GOTY edition with the extra missions and such, a no brainer in my opinion.

												I deleted my old review for the sake of writing a new one. This is the first game I reviewed and I don't think my old one did this title any justice.First of all, let me preface this by saying that this is, hands down, no holds barred, my favorite game. Ever. Of all time. Everything from the atmosphere to the gameplay to the replayability is just... It's flawless.Well, in my opinion at least. I won't lie, there are some pretty big flaws with the game that are hopefully addressed in a future sequel. Seriously, I hope.In general, this game is sort of the child of Bioshock and Thief (The original Thief series, not the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥reboot). It's a stealth-action game that goes through a linear story of ten missions. In addition to this, there are three DLC packs. The first is the ""Dunwall City Trials"" pack which adds another ten missions, though those are more side/minigames. They're very challenging and I recommend them for pro players who want to test themselves. There are two story-based DLCs following another character on top of that. ""The Knife of Dunwall"" adds three missions and ""The Brigmore Witches"" adds another four (though one is just an intro mission, really.)The gameplay is where this game shines the most. While each mission, and map in general, is highly linear, there are a countless number of ways to approach each mission objective and it's limited only by your creativity and whatever weapons/powers you have. In the spirit of Bioshock, the protagonist (Corvo in the main story, Daud in the DLC) wields a sword in his right hand, and an arsenal of weapons and supernatural powers in the left. Swordplay is very tight, surpassing that of games like Chivalry and Skyrim, in my opinion. (Of course, that's in MY opinion.) It's very streamlined with a dedicated attack button and a block button, and it's all about timing parries and knowing when and where to strike. As for the other hand, you gain, early on in the story, the Blink power, which allows instantaneous teleportation across short distances. On top of that, you can unlock further powers, like Posession (which allows you to possess rats and animals, and can be upgraded to possess people), Bend Time (slows down time Matrix-style, and full-on stops it when upgraded), and a ton more. On top of that, you have a few subweapons like an upgradable pistol and a crossbow that fires different kinds of darts like steel darts, tranquilizers, and explosive/incendiary darts. You also get a few other cool stuff like razor traps and grenades.Now, with all these options you can clearly see why there's a number of ways to approach your target. There's a ton of combinations you can use against enemies. Freeze time, shoot a few rounds at multiple guards, and watch as they all go flying at once. How about possessing a guard and making him walk in front of his buddy's bullet? While this is technically a stealth game... I mean, c'mon, you have all these toys? Why not wreak a little havoc? Slice and dice and shoot down everything in sight. Or maybe you're like me, where you prefer not to be seen? Good news for you, you can literally go through the entire game (both the main mission and the DLC), and I stress this, THE ENTIRE GAME, without either killing a single person or being seen or detected once. Good. God.Now, while it seems like I have nothing but endless praise for this game, for the sake of not sounding like a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shill, I do have to say this game had a few flaws.For one thing, it CAN get a little dull once you've played it enough. The replayability is endless but sometimes you'll find yourself using the same strategies each time. Blink is outright broken and there's even an achievement for not buying/upgrading ANY powers and just using Lv. 1 Blink. And the sad thing is, if you know what you're doing... It's not hard.Secondly, the music is really highly forgettable, and the only good song in the game is the closing track, ""Honor For All"". The sound direction is okay at best, and really you only use it to avoid being detected by listening for sounds.And the story is really kind of dull. The characterization is abysmal and the writing is predictable and cliche. Now I say this, but the Daud DLC really improves on both writing and characterization, so it's not as big a problem with that... Just don't expect anything much playing the main story.Another thing I saw this game catch flak for (I didn't mind it so much myself, but it is a legitimate grievance) is that the game punishes you for going high chaos. IE being detected often, killing too many people (threshold is about 30% of npcs per mission). You will get the bad endings. On the upside though, if you prefer this playstyle and don't mind the endings, it does sort of reward you by making areas more highly populated by guards and other enemies. If you like to kill a lot, you get more to kill. You'll just get the bad ending in the process. You'll definitely want to try both playstyles.Now, those complaints aside, I still HIGHLY recommend this game for literally everyone. Even if you're a casual gamer, or an RPG fan, or an FPS fan, or hell, even an RTS fan, just give it a go once. There's a very good chance you won't regret it. It's really a fantastic title.			"

Dishonored - an epic fantasy title by Arkane Studios... can it counter a game like Skyrim? Let's find out!Imagine a pretty solid guard who gets magical powers by a supernatural guy known as The Outsider, being falsely accused of murdering the queen... doesn't that sound pretty cool? Well, it actually is!Dishonored takes place in the industrial city of Dunwall, where technology and otherwordly forces coexist. The city design is modeled on London and Edinburgh in the 18th century. With a very dark and foggy atmosphere and an interesting art style, aesthetically it serves very well as eye-candy. But not only the graphical aspects make this game a masterpiece - the concept designs, story lore and mechanics are solid and complex. Since it's sadly not a sandbox game, you are relatively limited to exploring, freedom of roaming etc - but the points above completely compensate to that. The storyline is a masterpiece, aesthetics are eye candy and an engine that is actually working. Sounds satisfying, right? Besides the awesome visuals provided by the dark themed style - you also get supercool abilities which give you tons of possibilites how to defeat your enemies - or sneak past them without anyone noticing. Different playstyles are definetely possible in this game, and give even the sneakiest rogue-players a good challenge and satisfaction. I would buy, and recommend the game again!10/10Originally posted by ysarts (Specs):GTX 980i7 4790k @3.9ghz32GB Vengeance RAMCooler Master V8120GB SSD + 3TB ext. "

												Although it's advertised under the stealth genre, Dishonored is, more or less, what you make of it. Dunwall, the game's focal city and capital of the empire, is in the midst of crisis. Its beloved empress has been assassinated, and you - her bodyguard Corvo - have the blame thrust upon you simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Her daughter, and proper heir to the throne, is kidnapped by those truly responsible for her mother's death. Meanwhile, the destabilized empire struggles to contain an outbreak of plague, which has been spreading throughout the city at unprecedented speeds.Armed with an arsenal of gadgets and powers, Corvo must traverse his way through the rapidly dilapidating urban center of Dunwall. Your mission is to rescue heir Emily and clear your name: the mastermind of the assassination has seized power and appointed his fellow conspirators to key positions in the government. It is here where the game begins, freed from prison by unexpected benefactors. How you choose to accomplish your goals will greatly affect the city, others' opinions of you, and the game's outcome; should Corvo indiscriminately slaughter the innocent and guilty along the way, Dunwall will visibly deteriorate throughout the course of the game. Conversely, it's possible to complete the game through entirely nonlethal means - and young Emily will be watching, influenced by her role model's moral compass. Dishonored is unique in that two different people can approach the game with two separate playstyles and come away with two different impressions. There is a lot more depth to the game's story than meets the eye and while the nonlethal ending is far more fulfilling, the lethal and nonlethal routes will yield two very different games. If you are a fan of stealth-based gameplay, adapting your movements carefully to avoid detection, you should be delighted with Dishonored. If you prefer to steamroll your way through haphazardly, you may be less impressed.			"

												Dishonored is a gritty action stealth game in which you play a revenge-driven assassin with a full complement of deadly gadgets and supernatural magics. There is an emphasis on avoiding bloodshed, in combining logic and patience (mostly patience), to outwit the enemies and follow the storyline, undetected.Never fear, if you are completely incapable of sneaking past a guard, even if he was deaf, blind, and asleep - like me, Dishonored still offers you the awesome fun of hacking, slashing and zapping everything to death in a bloody rage. This is called a high chaos playthrough - and it'll change the storyline, and affect the way you play the levels, what side quests you can complete and ultimately, the ending. If you are some sort of crazy completionist, you'll have two whole playthroughs to enjoy, and some of the achievements are only to be attempted by those with the patience of a saint, and prepare to lose some sanity in the process.Downsides are the game is a wee bit on the short side; although if you're buying the GOTY addition this is somewhat made up for in the story DLC which adds a fair chunk of side story as well as some new gadgets and abilities.A unique setting, compelling storyline, fluid gameplay, replayability and challenge, in case you can't tell, I recommend!

												Very good game. Polished and nice. Replay value is quite high and I was very much entertained by all my playthroughs. And I just love the fact that this is one of those stealth games, which not only allows, but also encourages you to play it without killing anyone (even your main targets)! If you love the genre, this is a must-have!

												I'm aware that this is an unpopular opinion, but it's just that- an opinion.I've played the vanilla game twice, once as an insane murderer, stabbing and shooting my way through a city, and once as a pacifist twiddling his thumbs as the guard crawls past at a snail's pace. I didn't have the DLC for this game.Very unenjoyable to me. The game's mechanics and story had an excellent setup, but failed to deliver at all. By mechanics, I mean specifically stealth. It's boring to stealth because everyone has a 2 inch sightline and the memory of a goldfish to match. The most fun I remember having is tied between the ""time manipulation"", and my murder playthrough. There's clearly a mismatch in story and gameplay: the most fun most people have is, most likely, the murder playthrough. Stab and shoot and stab and laugh, because if you're looking for a game where it's fun to just mess around as basically a god, then this game is great, two thumbs up. But as a stealth game? The whole thing is booooring. You crawl around, blink to skip encounters, you have just one stealth item in comparison to the 30-odd items that you have to murder people, so don't forget to spend your cash on that when you can. On the other hand, nothing was quite as fun as getting detected, stopping time, running into the vents... and then the fun stops as everyone scours everywhere but above them. This game world wants you to play like a pacifist, but the game makes you want to play as a psycho. I didn't even want to play through twice, but Sam somehow guilted me into it.In terms of story, I don't think I cared at all until I found Sam the boat guy (I think that's his name... I can't even remember my favorite character's name.) alive at a certain point when most characters were dead. The setup is incredible here, there's details everywhere about the world and how it's dying, and how the whales are critical to the survival of the people- but then you talk to them, and you wish you could just stop playing because everyone talks like they've just woken up and they just don't understand why this peasant wants to talk to them about saving the world. And if you try and pay attention, that attention to detail appears again as the devs have created this arcs for these characters, some of which overlap, but then the failure to deliver ruins any enjoyment.OVERALLFun fighting, ""loud"" mechanicsDetailed world and charactersStealth is suprisingly boring in a stealth gameCharacters might put you to sleepWorld is boring to actually look at.

												A great game that has consequences based on how you play whether you're aggressive and kill everyone or a pacifist and sneak past everyone.One of the best if not the best first person stealth games I've ever played in my life. The addition of supernatural powers just gives the game more options for the player to finish a mission which can already have many alternate ways to complete.9/10			"

												Bayağı oldu inceleme yazmayalı. Bunun en büyük nedeni 1 saat 2 saat oynayıpta inceleme yazmayı sevmiyorum. Kısa bir oyunsa bitirdikten sonra yazmayı tercih ediyorum. Yok değilse en azından inceleme yazacak kadar oynama taraftarıyım. Bazen görüyorum; adam yardırmış, giydiriyor oyuna. Oynama süresine bakıyorum; 15-20 dk, oyunun vaadettiği süreye bakıyorum 50 saat 60 saat hatta bazen 100 saat. Ben bu incelemenin nesini dikkate alayım. Destan yazın demiyorum ama 50 saatlik senaryousu olan oyuna da 15 dk oynayıp inceleme yazmayın. Gerçekten komik oluyor. İçimi döktükten sonra gelelim incelemeye. Eski pc min über berbatlığı yüzünden bir türlü oynayamadığım oyunlardan biriydi Dishonored. Düşünün şu anki pc imle 100 küsür fpslerde oynadığım Dishonored eski pc imde medium da 30 fps yi zor görüyordu. Optimizasyonun ne kadar mükemmel olduğunu burdan da anlayabilirsiniz ve tabi eski pc min über berbatlığını :) Kısmet bugünlereymiş. Neyse güç olsun da güç olmasın diyerekten devam edeyim. En sonda söyleyeyim; oyun çok çok güzel. Özellikle oynanış kısmı mükemmel. Hele bir de gamepadiniz varsa alacağınız keyif 3-5 e katlanıyor.  Dishonored size inanılmaz bir serbestlik sunuyor. Gizlilik/aksiyon türünde bir oyun olmasına rağmen sizi hiçbir şeye zorlamıyor. ""İlla bu yoldan gideceksiniz"" diye bişey yok oyunda. Tamamen size kalmış. İster milleti doğraya doğraya gidin. İster hiçkimseyi öldürmeyin, isterseniz hiç farkedilmeden ilerleyin. Tamamen size kalmış. Grafiklere gelecek olursak çok iyi diyemem ama çokta kötü değil oyunun temasına uygun olmuş. Açıkçası gerçekçi grafikler yakışmazmış bu oyuna. Oynadıkça onu farkettim. Zaten bi yerden sonra grafik umrunuzda olmuyor ki bu çoğu oyun için geçerli. Oyun kaliteliyse bir şekilde oynatıyor kendini. Dishonored bir intikam hikayesi. Bi görev dönüşünde kraliçe öldürülür ve kızı kaçırılır. Suç bizim üzerimize kalır ve hapse gireriz. İdamımızı beklerken bir şekilde hapisten kaçmayı başarır ve kraliçenin kızını aramaya koyuluruz. Bir yandan da adımızı temize çıkarmak için uğraşırız. Biraz klişe bir hikaye ama ucu açık bitiyor Dishonored 2 nin duyurulduğundan hiç haberiniz bile olmasa oyunu bitirdikten sonra ""bunun mutlaka devamı gelir"" diyorsunuz. Uzun lafın kısası; hala bugüne kadar oynamadıysanız ilk fırsatta mutlaka satın alın ve oynayın. Parasını sonuna kadar hak eden bir yapım olmuş. Ben oyunu yüksek kaos ta bitirdim. Gerçi son 5 bölümün 4 ünde öldürdüğüm insan sayısı 10 bile değildi ama başlarda katliam yaptım resmen ondan sanırım. Ama siz mümkün olduğunca gizli ilerlemeye çalışın böylece hem itemlerinizi fazla harcamak zorunda kalmazsınız hem de mermi/ok sıkıntısı çekmezsiniz. Ayrıca araştırmacı olun. Direkt göreve gitmeyin.

												Dishonored is a very good, very well put together game. Don't let Yahtzee's review discourage you (unless you also completely despise silent protagonists, binary moral choice, powerful superhuman abilities (wait, that's a bad thing?) and want more than 5-30 hours of gameplay [depending on your pace]). Besides, despite his apparently negative review, he still listed it as 5th best of 2012 (same goes for The Walking Dead, at #4). Also, the game resembles Thief, Half-Life 2, and Bioshock. That, together with the fact that it's actually pretty good should be plenty reason to play it.			"

												An excellent, albeit not great, FPS game!If I had to summarize Dishonored in one sentence, that would be: A stealth-based Bioshock.Truly the game's mechanics (weapons in one hand, magic in the other, plus a big variety of ways to -or not to- kill the enemies), dark story with enough twists and choise-based multiple endings reminded me a lot of Bioshock, though Dishonored comes as a lot more stealth based than the former (and personally less innovative than Bioshock, in my opinion).Nonetheless, Dishonored is an excellent stealth game, thanks to its magical powers hiding becomes a lot simplified, compared to traditional stealth games like Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell and I can say even fun enough. Some magic powers like Blink, Possession and Time Bend, to name a few, were really innovative and cool to use.The rest of the weapons (a pistol and a crossbow with various types of ammunition, a variety of grenades or mines, plus your standard sword) provide very brutal kills, for the FPS players wanting action and not stealth.Basically the game is set so that the choices you make affect the ending and your deeds catch up to you: needlessly killing many characters in the game will result in the so called High Chaos and as so a bad ending, while sparing the lives of most enemies will result in the Low Chaos ending, the good one.I'll have to admit though that I was expecting more from the main story, based on all the good reviews I had seen of the game, while I found it just ok: it had a few twists, but nothing as shocking as, say again, Bioshock. I'll admit that the story is quite dark though and full of betrayals and brutal killings, should the player decide to go that way.While I usually find myself liking these multiple endings in games, Dishonored and it's achievements are set to make you play the game at the very least twice, so as to see both endings and collect each one's achievements, which, if you add the fact that the game's last two DLCs demand the same treatment, makes the game very time-devouring (took me about two months to get all the endings and achievements, without playing every day of course though).Speaking of the games DLCs, there are three in total: the first one, Dunwall City Trials, is, as its name suggests, a set of various challenges and not related to the game's story, while the two latter ones, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, show the story from the perspective of another character, the assassin Daud.As it happens with many TV series spin-offs, I found myself enjoying the Daud DLCs a lot more than the main story, their duration was shorter and just enough to make you enjoy the game (even with both endings) and the connection they made to the main game made the story a lot more enjoyable. What helped it a lot, in my opinion, was the fact that I found it a lot easier to empathize with Daud, who has the opportunity to make amends for his past deeds and get his redemption, compared to the overall ""good-guy"" assassin of the main game, Corvo, who is there just to save the day.The fact that Daud had a voice actor (Michael Madsen of Kill Bill fame) helped the above fact, while Corvo was, sadly, your usual mute protagonist (meaning that we just don't get to hear him speak, not that he is an actual mute in the game, think of Gordon Freeman for example). Hopefully, in the now announced Dishonored sequel, they will fix this issue and give Corvo a voice actor.On the other hand, the Dunwall City Trials is a sadistic DLC, with the challenges's difficulty reminiscent of very hard 8-bit platformer games. I'll even admit that in order to get the final five, or so, achievements and not leave the game incomplete, I had to resort to using a trainer program, with which (before you can even think of accusing me of cheating) let me tell you that I still had trouble in getting said achievements, you can imagine the difficulty (though I'll admit some challenges were a bit fun, when you got the hand of them).Leaving the story aside, the graphics were also just good, I was expecting a bit more of them from all the positive reception of the game, but at the same time they were not bad. What I personally found bad, was the game's PC optimization, it resulted in a lot of lag and low performance in my side, while the graphics didn't justify such issue. I found out that many AMD graphic card users like myself had similar issues, truly a shame (one of the reasons I had to resort to using a trainer program for the Dunwall City Trials DLC was also related to lag, impossible to play some challenges with it).The Soundtrack, again, was just ok, fitting, but nothing too immersive. Maybe it had to do with the game's stealth atmosphere, this is not Doom or Wolfenstein after all, but still...Gameplay-wise though, the game was quite great, the quick-access wheel was very comfortable to quickly find your next weapon and the creativity you had with the ""stealth or kill"" environment was nice.Overall, the game was excellent and I'm not trying to say otherwise, but personally the big hype and the frame rate issues were what ruined it a bit for me.I'll still recommend it for the moral choices it provided, the few plot twists and the variety of ways to engage or avoid enemies. Most of all, I'll repeat it, I recommend it for the two Daud DLCs, which will make you appreciate the main story a lot more.			"

												No matter how you look at it, this game is a masterpiece, 10/10, AAA and pretty much just epic. If you didn't play or dislike this game, you're terrible at gaming in general and should uninstall Steam. The first DLC isn't too interesting, but the other 2 are great so you really should go for the GOTY edition.			"

												Dishonored is a fantastic, original game with a great art style and soundtrack. I enjoyed all the missions, although The Golden Cat was my favorite. Even though the graphics are not superb, the game looks so unique that you will not care. It is fun to use the powers, sneak around, and even have shootouts with the guards, and since the main part of the game is supposed to be stealth, it has some of the best stealth gameplay on the market. The Dunwall City Trials DLC that comes with the Game of the Year edition is worth it if you can get it for $2.50, but it is nothing like The Knife of Dunwall or the Witches of Brigmore, two DLC single-player campaigns that are shorter but are just as high quality as the main game. If you enjoy Skyrim's Dark Brotherhood, Thief, or games like those, then this is the game for you. If you are going to buy Dishonored, make sure to get the Game of the Year edition.			"

Then you're just like WTF I'm really sad :(A lot of playtime for a story game that ends when you complete the story (unlike, say Skyrim, where you're free to do what you want). Ignore the people whining about 10 hours max playtime. There are people with 1000+ hours playtime, OK?I bought a pizza for more money than this game.I know.It's ridiculous.Very expensive pizza.Whiskey and cigars/10 for most flexible stealth game.Remember to tell Piero Joplin off.No social decency. Snowflake lock. Honestly.I thought I was bad at lying.I apologise if you thought this review was disjointed and random, but that's because it is, so live with it. :)			"

It is that much fun to play through. This game is a must own in my opinion.			"

												Beautiful game with excellent stealth gameplay. I don't really even like stealth games but this is novel enough and well designed enough to hold my attention. What is great about dishonored is that the stealth is easy regardless of your own skill level, but completing a level well requires you to practice and to observe your enviroment to an extra degree (and the devs really have included lots of ways to go about your objective)What I like especially is that Dishonored allows me to explore a captivating new universe. I think the story is hit or miss, but the way the universe and the game world work together is great.			"

												   I want to start out by saying this game IMO deserves a 9/10. I highly encourage you to pick this game up, upon reading this review! It's a great game, and I loved every second of it! There really aren't many negative things to say, but I do have a one or two. Let's start with the PROS.              PROS                  *Stealth- You can play this game with out much confrontation. Sneak around, sparing the lives of your enemies. (The more blood you  shed, the darker the game's outcomes will be in multiple ways.) Their are many ways to silently, and humanely dispose of your foes, with out shedding too much bodily fluid, but at the same time, you can slit their throats, and leave them choking on their own blood, or send crossbolts into their flesh, unknowingly. Maybe if you're feeling the urge to see your enemies scatter in fear, you can rewire, and turn their own defenses against them, witnessing the cool breeze taking their warm, dry ashes with it. Don't feel like a coward if you need to run away. It is a very huge part of the stealth gameplay. The best part, is that you can not only run, but jump, climb, slide your way into the shadows or roof tops, leaving your pursuers to fumble around in the gnarly, Brined Hagfish scented crop dust you left for them to choke on. Their are many ways to ""neutralize your enemies, but I'll let you discover that with your prefered play style.                                  *Close Combat (When you don't care who hears and sees)- You can always go head on and Destroy your enemies, leaving them in their own puddles of blood and ash. Upgrade your sword, and pistol, to mold them into the killing machines they are meant to be. Nothing like striking down your foe, and thrusting cold, sharp steel in between his shoulder blades. Explosive bolts? Yeah, I'm sure you can imagine how many head will be rolling when you get your hands on those babies.                  *Engaging Story- I really enjoyed the story, even though it didn't take me long to complete it. There are many ways to play through it, with loads of choices, allowing you to play the story your way. The game has unique characters, and rewarding side mission's that will have you treking in the direction you so chose to go.                  *Runes, and Bone Charms- These are basically items that power up your character, and abilities. They give you the ability to make the Corvo that you want.                  *Bethesda- (Nuff said)            CONS (or things I would've liked better)                  *Non-Lethal Melee Attacks- The game definitely has it's ways of dealing with enemies once they spot you. (IE.. Sleep darts, Running away, Killing.. ect.) However, I would've liked to be able to bash an enemy with my sword, rendering him unconsious, rather then gutting him like an animal. I just wish that there were some alterative ways to silencing an agro enemy, without killing them, or wasting precious sleep darts. (and they are precious!) There are just those times, when running away may not be an option, and if you don't want to compromise your belief that all life is precious, then that means re-loading a last save. The only alternative, is to be more sneaky, and plan out your takedowns. I'd say it's a way of making the game more challenging, but I think combat was that already, especially when surrounded by multiple enemies, shooting, and stabbing you.Like I said, not many cons. That's the only one that I had, and it wasn't really a con. More of a reference, really. Anyways, pick up the game and try it out, before #2 comes out! It's going to be awesome, and I hope it lives up to all the hype! Well, Happy slashing!                                                                                                                                 Sincerely, Deathtoll. (:			"

												What we have here is a case of a developer who knew exactly what kind of game they wanted to make and executed that vision near flawlessly. The game is a blast to play and the ability to choose how to best exact your revenge is extremely satisfying. Even the story DLC is better than most standalone games. Plus the guy who did visual designs for Half-Life 2 worked on this so this is as close as you'll get to visiting City 17 again. This sh*t would be worth it even if you bought it at full price.			"

												I played through this game only once and I felt like I missed a good amount of the content.  I was a little disappointed that I was only told that the number of people I killed influenced the state of the story and city after a couple of levels where I had already killed a number of people.  After that I Primarily used nonlethal takedowns.  Even for characters who were targets of a mission, I chose the stealthy and sneaky way to kill as few people as possible,  but everybody still reveared me as a mass murderer, so for the last few levels I just said screw it and killed everybody.  Stealthing is pretty fun, but the combat mechanics feel kind of clunky.  Perhaps they meant for it to be this way to encourage you to be sneaky.  Although, the problem I found with going full sneaky-beaky is that there would be a lot of weapons and powers that you would never be able to use since they are loud and explody and cause your enemies to be eaten by a swarm of rats as they scream in agony.  So either way It feels like you can't get the whole experience of the game in just one playthrough.  That was my main issue.  Other than that, it was entertaining.			"

												A well-made game where the player's choices greatly impact the outcome of not just the ending but later in the game as well, Dishonored puts you in the position of Corvo Attano, in an alternate world 1837 filled with magic, corruption, advanced technology, and a revenge-seeking dishonored assassin. I have played Dishonored's main storyline so many times I lost count long ago (but enough times to say almost all of the dialogue along with the characters), then purchased and used every single DLC for it and played them through several times as well, and now I can say that this is actually one of my favorite games. Compared to the Fallout and Elder Scrolls series, Dishonored is one of Bethesda's lesser known games, denying it of much of the fame and love it deserves.			"

												It feels like a Mixtape between Bioshock Infinite and Thief.  It's about revenge; armed with deadly weapons and supernatural powers, you seek vengeance upon all of those who orchestrated your downfall. It's about a city; the plague-ridden industrial port of Dunwall is lovely to behold, exciting to explore, and seething with secrets. It´s about rescueing a little girl the daughter of the murdered Queen.  The Story is very exciting and its told in a good way..not too much and not too less. So you are never bored and have to skip videos and you also know always why you do what you do. The incredible variety of ways you can engage or evade your enemies is impressively flexible and utterly captivating. The Graphics are fine. Im using an old 2 Core Computer atm..it runs perfectly smooth on it, so it got very well programmed. I didnt see any Bugs. It has easy controls and also Full Controller Support, both work perfectly fine. I cant say anything negative about this game. If you love Games like Bioshock Infinite or Thief then defenetily buy it. Its in the sales for 3,24 € and its worth minimum 20 € compared to the quality of this game, so im very pleased with it.			"

It´s about rescueing a little girl the daughter of the murdered Queen.  The Story is very exciting and its told in a good way..not too much and not too less. So you are never bored and have to skip videos and you also know always why you do what you do. The incredible variety of ways you can engage or evade your enemies is impressively flexible and utterly captivating. The Graphics are fine. Im using an old 2 Core Computer atm..it runs perfectly smooth on it, so it got very well programmed. I didnt see any Bugs. It has easy controls and also Full Controller Support, both work perfectly fine. I cant say anything negative about this game. If you love Games like Bioshock Infinite or Thief then defenetily buy it. Its in the sales for 3,24 € and its worth minimum 20 € compared to the quality of this game, so im very pleased with it.			"

IntroductionWant a game that makes you feel immersed by its colorful and peaceful atmosphere? A game where you could explore the world to its unimaginable limits? Last but not least, a game that is immensely moddable? Well, this game is not for you! Dishonored is an underdog game developed by Arkane Studios that brings you to a new universe filled with government corruption, discrimination towards the lower-middle class, and rat plague.You'll be able to play as the disgraced lord protector, Corvo Attano, who seeks revenge towards those who... 'dishonored' him... -along with the Outsider's powers that apparently requires you a lot of mana potions for you to do some rad killstreaks. That unless you want a stealthy approach, then prepare to load your game every single moment the enemy spots you for ridiculous reasons.If you have the DLCs, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, you'd also be playing as the master assassin, Daud, who journeys through Dunwall discovering the mystery of a powerful Witch who deems to rule the city (and soon the world). His goal is to stop her evil plan to justify the guilt trip that he had after what he did.ReviewThe game is close enough to being a masterpiece if not because of the difficulty it lacks (there's a mod for that apparently), the strange bugs that haven't been fixed after 2-3 years, and the nerve wracking plot. However, it was still able to live up as one of the greatest games that came out as a first title to a new franchise. It gave us a fresh feeling to a new game by giving us a powerful yet stealthy assassin that has a mix of first-person combat and cheap parkour. It has some sort of semi-rpg aspects put into it since there are sub-quests scattered all around the area during your mission and there are choices you make that slightly affects the environment of the next mission and the game's ending.THE PROSAs you dwell into the plot, you'd think that the whole story would be cliched. You are right. However, it won't be a linear one. The game gives you a choice or rather an opportunity that would affect the last chapter of the game. In fact, the main story is more dynamic than an Elder Scrolls game but less dynamic than a Fallout game. The books that you probably wouldn't read includes the game's lore of the city and outside of it and some journals that once you look at the corpse who wrote it, you'd feel bad for him/her. Seriously, those rotting couples who died while hugging each other and being surrounded by plague rats, and an enemy guard that has an infected friend who wanted to euthanize him; these started to hit me right in the feels after reading their last words written on a letter... It shows how cruel the plague has lead to the people of Dunwall.In terms of gameplay, the developers were somehow able to make the game pass through that awful area that we call: repetitiveness. As mentioned a while ago, the game gives us varied ways to go through the objective. On each mission, there are sewers, open hallways, alleys, or hidden passage ways for you to decide whether you go rampage mode or go Thief style sneaking through every living obstacle. Even though the upgrades were only few, upgrading one skill already delivers an impact to the gameplay.Other than that, the graphics are the ones that surprised me out of all the stuffs I've experienced in this game. The developers have learned that even mere textures and right lighting could make a visually compelling atmosphere without having high-poly models and applying the frame killing Ambient Occlusions. An eye trick as what it seems. What more if you add a graphic enhancer mod to it.The audio gave a decent feel into the game's surroundings. The soundtracks were so emotional that it immersed me throughout my playthrough. They made a way to make the ambience feel lively even if the area wasn't crowded. Overall, it's decent.THE CONSHere's the part where it gets slightly bad. On the plot of the main story, the part where your 'allies' tell the things you do for the mission doesn't make sense for me since they themselves never tend to help you at all! Captain: ""Corvo, kill this man in order to cripple the main boss! Now if you'll excuse me, the other loyalists and I will just stay here in the pub and intensify our tea-sipping as you kill 50 men on your way."" The DLC story although fixed that by giving you the power to summon your allies and fight with you, but the main story of the game apparently never had such.Going back to gameplay, there are cases in the game where it starts to glitch out such as when you have to bring an unconscious body to someone for a non-lethal approach of the mission. Once you go near to the person who told you the objective while bringing the body, it will go to a scene where the conversation starts and your character will drop the unconscious body which somehow lead to his/her death. Thus, your non-lethal objective failed. There are also some cases where you just wanted to hide the body, but as you gently drop them near a movable object, it's possible that when they hit the object, they'll die. It's one of those annoying things if you wanted to achieve something in the game.Even though the UI settings was well implemented (though, you can't turn off the item selection UI whenever you bind them to your hotkeys), it's hard to say the same thing with the graphics options. Obviously, it lacks options. - AA only has 3 options: Off, MLAA, and FXAA- There are no Shadow options at all- The Rat Shadows doesn't even work even if you toggle it On!- Level of Detail options don't existYou may ask why are all of these mentioned when they're practically unnecessary; it's because there's actually an option for that if you look into a/an .ini file! You can even change the density of the particles, turn up the textures that is beyond the in-game texture settings, and increase the intensity of Anti-Aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering! Other than that, there are those very VERY low-res textures even if the textures were set on high. Even a 2000s game could beat this (that would be those Source engine games).Lastly on the audio, the guard dialogues were repetitive that it ended up being funny whenever you hear them; the rest of the characters however were good as it's not overly exaggerated nor dead boring.Verdict  Concept Rating   Main Plot 7/10 (+DLCs 9/10)+ Dynamic story depending on your actions+ (DLC) Plot Twists- Main story is predictable and linear- A couple of questionable plot holes- cliche cliche cliche   Gameplay 8/10 (+DLCs 7.8/10)+ Gametime of 1 to 30 hours depending on your style of gameplay+ Lots of choices with a different experience on each+ Each power upgrade matters- A few bugs/glitches- (DLC) Daud's Powers are OP!   Graphics 8/10 + Visually stunning environments+ Surprisingly smooth FPS while maintaining the current gen graphics- Lacks graphic options- Some really low-res textures on certain areas    Audio 8/10+ Decent yet immersive soundtracks+ Ambience? Good.+ Upright voice acting- ""Think you'll get your own squad after what happened last night?"" (10x)  OVERALL: 8/10 - Great game for a new franchiseOVERALL (+DLCs): 8.9/10 - DLCs are the ones that spiced it up "

												From the creators of Deus Ex and Thief, with the talents of the art director from Half-Life 2 comes Dishonored, and man, does it ever show. The streets of Dunwall are like how City 17 might have been if it was in a world where magic and steampunk technology existed, and the threat wasn't from aliens but corrupt officials who stole power after a beloved leader died.As Corvo Attano, you get to choose just how you'll seek your revenge; with bloody brutality, subtle killings, or neither. Much like Batman (and in Fallout), you can go through the entire game not killing anyone, and also like Batman, you can still manage to unnerve your opponents by doing so. There's no leveling system, but you do gain a limited amount of runes and money, which lets you customize your character to fit your playstyle. The world is enormous and there's lots of scripted events and passageways which exclude the other, so you will not be able to see everything in one playthrough.One of those rare recent games worth buying right now, at full price. If it ever goes on sale and you still don't have it, then you certainly MUST jump on the opportunity and do so. Highly recommended.			"

												This is one of the greatest masterpieces of recent computer games. A cautivating story, a well designed playability and the sandboxed environments with multiple paths reminds me a victorian-style Deus Ex: Human Revolution.It may be difficult to become an expert efficient assassin in the first gameplay so that plus the capability to replay it in numerous different ways is the perfect incentive to travel through Dunwall two, three or even more times exploring, practicing and enjoying all the secrets and learning about the background and the history of the nation and its people.Long story short, this is one of my most precious games in my library so I have nothing to say about it but good things.

												There's something more about this game , it's not just ""find your target and kill whoever stand in your way"" stealth game. (I'm looking at you assassin's creed)Your actions define the ending , kill or spare ? chaos or not ? lethal or non-lethal ? EVERYTHING affects the ending even the world reacts to your actions ; weepers , rat plague , guard chatters . pretty nice detail (good job arkane studios)Even there's so many ways to your target .It's true that assassinating people with witchcraft is fun , but are you ready to face the consuqences ? spreading chaos wherever you walk while the Outsider watches you ?There's something i learned from this game , revenge NEVER solves everything (180 degrees different from the game's trailer XD)11/10 Would non-lethal takedown again.

												Definitely worth at least 2 playthroughs. One of the better games in terms of the look and feel for stealth or even just straight up gung ho action isn't too bad but gets heavily repetetive, however AI feels pathetically unaware of surroundings even on hardcore. Knife of Dunwall threw me off a bit. Felt very awkward in level design compared to the original game and the abilities were kind of unentertaining. Will come back for Brigmore Witches at some stage.

												Cant count how many times I've played this on my PS3 , this is the best game of all time and was a refreshing trip from the endless killing presented in other games at the time of it's release. Actions actually have consequences and even a minor choice here and there can affect how the game ends for you. There are three major endings but each of these can vary slightly based on small things. Pros:1. Amazing gameplay and stealth mechanics , but the guards might seem ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times (like everyone who doesn't know Clark Kent is Superman like how TF do you not recognize him ?!! He just slicked his hair with gel and took off his glasses ) I love the combat as well. 2. Choices have consequences , more killing plus bad choices lead to a bad ending and vice versa. But it's well  balanced how many bad choices you can make before you cross the threshold into a dark and twisted world. You should play it for yourself to experience this but it's a highly detailed system. If you play as a maniac who goes kicking down the front door and taking lots of hits , a character in the game will eventually let you know about a health elixir shortage and you will experience a shortage of said elixir.3. Amazing Storyline that can go  many ways the possibilities are endless , and there are small side stories hidden throughout the world . I couldn't find them all in one playthrough but they are each interesting enough to be worth your time.  I also love the Knife of Dunwall DLC , where you can see everything from Daud's point of view. The DLC also implements the same choices and consequnces technique from the main game.4. You feel like you personally know some of the NPCs , and their character has aa lot of depth ( I'm looking at you Cecelia !) Cons: 1. If you own the definitive edition , the Void Walker's Arsenal gives you bit of a boost at the beginning of the game which i didn't like . It sort of ruins some of the gameplay involving loot and scavenging. 2. Dunwall City Trials is nothing impressive so pass on this one unless you purely like the gameplay without any story.Overall it's a great game but I only bought it on PC so I could see how it looks with all the graphics settings turned up. Recommend it to anyone who likes a good story in a stealth games and enjoys a refreshing break from the endless killing presented in games like GTA V , Far Cry , etc..			"

Posted: December 13, 2016
												So i have been dying to play a good bethesda game and do hope this game is another bethesda game i enjoy.....first being wolfenstien the new order. With that said i will be reviewing the game in a pro/ con style and ending with my final conclusion.Pro:      Wide open levels so you can tackle each assassination mission in a new and unique way. That is so cool it does remind me of other stealth games like the new hitman or metal gear solid 5. With that said the game doesnt limit you on play style so if you want to go around killing all that moves, you can. Want to be that guy who walks among the shadows to complete the mission, well you can do that too.      A variety of weapons. The weapons that corvo uses ranges from handgun, bow gun, sword, bombs, and magic. You can use any of that in a combo to pull off some really sick kills. Doing so feels so rewarding.     Multiple endings. The game gives you an ending based off of how much chaos the player gains, chaos is gained from high kill counts so you get one ending for being pretty much a pacifist and another for being a psychopath. That increases replayability.     Likeable characters. Everytime i hear samual talk it always brings a smile to my face because i really like his character and it doesnt end there, i like all characters to a degree but samual has to be my favorite.    Unlikable villains. Yea that sounds odd but it is a good thing because they were created so the player hates them, they need to be assassinated, ect. because they were pawns to a man you once worked with and got framed for murdering the queen you sworn to protect.Con:      The game starts out super strong with its amazing level design but ends with a limp wristed meh level design that focuses on for the most part linear style rather than its normal verticality wide open design. Sure i have 2 options of which ways to go but what is the point they are pretty similar that choosing one is no better or interesting that the other.     Wonky blink controls. I think it is a really cool and useful tool in the game but it does have some issues that really need to be fixed (which i know will never be fixed). When inside a tight room like in a building the ability to speed to cover in a stealth game is a must have. What if your cover is ceiling light? Oh boy, those things are a nightmare. Under pressure to flee and hide from incomming guards is so difficult when trying get on one. You can not be too close or you wont be able to blink up there but if your too far you also can not get up there so you need to find the right angle and distance which keep in mind you are in a rush to hide and this is the only hiding space in the location.     Glitched achievements. Some achievements are still glitched to which i say if i went through the entire game without killing a single enemy and i know for a fact i didnt kill a single enemy but didnt get my achievement. I am an achievement hunter and this annoys me to see this happening. I put in the work but just didnt get what i deserve.     Trial challenges. Nothing annoys me more than having to do these stupid challenges. Can you say buggy mess? I sure can. One challenge requires you to kill a specific target from hints gain from the map but sometimes when you kill the correct one the game throws you in a mission failed screen. Awsome. How about the stealth mission where on expert you can not use magic power....a main commonent of the game but guards have wonky pathing. Sometimes they walk through a door just to re-enter the same door 2 seconds later or completely change their AI route to be in reverse. What is this? Payday 2? Nah because payday 2 has better stealth where you can 1 have a partner spot you when your doing some objective and 2 not limit the main game play.Conclusion:            I really did like the game but i stand by that the trials dlc sucks. I hate being rushed to stealthly assassinate someone in a style similar to guess who. I dont like having the core gameplay ripped away from me. Sure it is suppose to be expert but why take so much to sneak in and steal stuff. Would it be easy? Yes but i can counter balance the wonky AI pathing and maintian flow. Stealthing was really fun in the main game due to having so many ways to funnel into my objective. You could go through the sewers to reach the location i need to be, go roof top jumping or running on the street to make my way to my location. Another reason why i hated moments i was inside small buildings like the doctor's house in the first mission or the entire last level. I highly reccommend the game but i still preffer the new order as my favorite bethesda game. So to new comers into this series, do pick up dishonored its a super fun game at its core but when you play the trials dlc.... prepare to see how just that dlc ruin's the games flow making things either unfun or obnoxiously difficult for no apparent reason just to slap on the title of expert. I dont mind a challenge but taking away the core of the game to make me expert...yea no, your just making me miss what the game is all about. Running around an open world doing an assassination how i want to and stealing some cash. These trials do not protray the game's core features in any good light so do skip that dlc. As for the other 2 dlc's i dont know how well they are im still stuck on the first dlc working on these challenges for those achievements.			"

												I just LOVE this game. It's like a stealth Bioshock Infinite, could match, or even be better than Deus Ex - Human Revolution. Great story, great lore (and I usually just skip through all the books), interesting powers and decisions that actually make difference in darkness of the world you're in.That said, I also must mention some cons. First of all, game is too easy, even on highest difficulty. It felt like there was same number of guards on normal and on very hard, just the amount of damage and their ability to spot you differ. Secondly, during the game you're giving decent amount of weapons and upgrades for them. But the game encourages you to try not to just go running and killing, which prevents you from using those weapons. Furthermore, sleeping darts and mana potions are far less found throughout the world, especially in last 2 missions, so if you didn't buy them before endgame and you run out...tough luck. On contrary, regular bullets, darts and other ""high chaos"" ammo can be found on any guard that you knock down, randomly on shelves and lockers, which becomes annoying at one point if you're trying to stealth the entire game.Also, if you're trying to go through the complete game without killing anyone, being detected or raising any alarms, be warned. Game has some unusual ways of crediting you with random deaths that happen around you that you did not cause or had anything to do with. But, nevertheless, this was the most challenging thing trying to do, I had so much fun doing it, and there is some strange satisfactory feeling waiting for your results after each chapter and finding out you did it perfectly.Game per se is short enough (around 10-15h) so it gives you opportunity to play it again, with other decisions so you can see how exactly dark/light can the world stay. Just...save a lot, have patience and have fun, this game definitely deserves high praises.			"

												Ended the main game and the DLCs on high and low chaos. I highly recommend killing everyone first and then challenge yourself not to kill anyone, how your different gameplays affect the story is interesting and self-fulfilling.The amount of different paths to complete the missions makes it re-play material, the controls are smooth, the graphics are decent, the story telling and the characters are incredible. The only downside I found is that I can’t have enough of it! It was worth every penny and more. (Can't wait for dishonored 2) "

												Completed a play through on my PS3 maybe 12 months before writing this review. Solid game. Imagine first person Assassins Creed with Skyrim-ish Magic and that's what Dishonored is. I would recommend anyone who likes Stealth games give this a shot, as the AI can be difficult at times to avoid or lure away. The DLC for the game is quite expansive, and even adds new features such as buying equipment pre-mission (but only in the DLC missions, sadly). The story is quite decent and the characters you meet are quite well designed and thought out and have some depth. It's a story of backstabbing and betrayal with a few plot twists that I didn't see coming. I consider this game one of my must plays.			"

												Dishonored is one of those games that doesn't have to innovate its gameplay or tell a particularly great story, rather it is a game that brings every element of its genre together in a perfect balance of addicting gameplay and enjoyable plot. It's hard to compare it to other games, the closest thing I've played is probably Thief: Deadly Shadows, another game that strikes a decent balance without really innovating its gameplay. For the right price, just about anyone can enjoy Dishonored, but if you are like me and bought the game on launch you probably felt a bit underwhelmed. It didn't really deliver on my expectations at the time, but over the years I have grown to appreciate it more. I don't particularly like the art direction or aesthetic of the game, but if you like contemporary steampunk you might enjoy it. No matter where your tastes lie, I doubt you will regret your purchase.			"

												Put simply, this is one of the very best games I have ever played. It bests Ocarina of Time, BioShock Infinte, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, etc. This is insanely replayable (on my third run as I write this). This is a game where you have many choices. Lethal or nonlethal, stealthy or guns blazing, different points of entry to buildings, etc. It fits anyone's ideal playstyle, whether that's combat or stealth. Arkane thought of everything with the level layouts. The atmosphere, level design, and setting are excellent. Dunwall may be my favorite video game setting ever. From what I've heard the DLC is even better than the main game. This game also presents a nice challenge, but even on Very Hard (my current run), the game is relatively easy once you get used to it. Dishonored, in my opinion, is one of the best video games ever made, and is in my personal top 5. I would give this game a 10. If I was stuck on a deserted island and I could only have three games with me, this would be my first choice. It's that damn good. I bought it for $4.99 and I feel like I've cheated Arkane here. I would have happily spent 60 at release for this game, and I will whenever a sequel releases. Just scroll up and go buy this game, even at full price. You WILL not regret it. tl;dr I love this game and probably sound like a paid shill but whatever 10/10			"

												I honestly didn't expect to love this game so much. But it has quickly become my favorite.The design of the city is amazing. The story is great. There are many different approaches to completing the tasks, which makes the game entertaining even if you play it over and over. You can kjill everyone in your way, or choose to kill noone. You can create chaos, or stay completely in the shadows. However the more poeple you kill, and the more chaos you make, the more rats and weepers you encounter. One more thing: the DLCs are absolutely fantastic. I especially loved Knife of Dunwall and Brigmore Witches DLCs, which together tell Dauds story from the point in time, when he assassinated the Empress. You pretty much get a second game.			"

												Yes this review is long, but I really enjoyed lol, there's a TL;DR at the end!Ooooh where to start? Well let's get the basics down first, Dishonored was definitely a well structured game. It's definitely unique from different stealth games I've played. I know it's been out for a while, but I just snagged it off of humble bundle for a nice price along with the dlc. It's honestly a shame I've waited this long to get my hands on this game. So to start off, Dishonored breaks the paradigm of stealth games to be honest. By that I don't mean it does some whacky off worldly♥♥♥♥♥♥where it changes and contorts ""stealth"" gameplay. The part that I really enjoyed about dishonored was actually the super natural aspect. The different abilities are new to me for stealth games, although in terms of stealth games I've only played the far cry series, splinter cell series, and theif. Regardless it was a nice refrehser since I am really starting to get into stealth games as of late. What was cool about that aspect was how the powers could be used differently and upgraded to fit your style of play. Depending on if you like to take it quiet, or for some reaason like to go loud and guns blazing in a stealh game (No judgement :D, you do your thing man) it really does cater to a variety of playstyles. This also goes a long way with weapon and gear upgrades as well. Another aspect I really enjoyed (Or enjoy in all games for that matter) was the decision making. Depending on how you play the game, it would actually alter how the game ends with the final cutscene. (If you're anything like me you won't actually replay the game just to see them -.-, instead you'll just look it up on youtube like me ^^) The next on the list would be the storyline. The plot was not the best, but I've definitely played games that have plots with less effort put into them. It was very simple and easy to follow, but there was a certain foreshadow that really gave it away (for me anyways). It was easy to see the ""twist"" coming, that is also due to the short gameplay. The story advances rather rapidly sort of giving away a decent amount. To add on to that, yes the gameplay was rather short actually! I was hoping for some more without the use of DLC. (This review is being written before playing the DLC, just so I can review the base product.) The game took me roughly 12 hours to complete and that wasn't on a run of just barging through the game and trying to finish. I took my time to try and soak in as much of the story as possible. While there some options to get more gameplay during missions (Won't go into specificis due to spoliers) the game didn't seem very content heavy. But despite there being some cons with the pros, I'd still give Dishonored an overall positive rating! It's worth it for the price it is, and while in my opinion it does not possess the best plot or content quantity, it makes up for it in its quality as well as uniqueness. If you want to have a fun time with a nice stealth expereince Dishonored is definitely a must have.TL;DR: You lazy ♥♥♥♥ers ~.~.Pro's: Unique gameplay. Caters to stealth lovers(IMO). Great quality. Versatile playstyle.Con's: Not too much gameplay content. Not a great game for those who like a good plot. Overall rating:9/10. This is because I never really care about the amount of content, so as long as the gameplay is dynamic. I also could care less for the plot, I read Dean Koontz if I want a plot.			"

												It is kind of late for a review for this game, but after my second playthrough I think I should tell you guys how great this game is.You play in first person in a medieval world with magic and science. You will start a level with at least one goal, sometimes the goals change or you get more goals or you can decide which of the ways to reach the goals you want to use. Mostly it is the decicion: Lethal or not lethal.Inside the level you are free to go where you want. You can play the whole game like DARK, you try to not to be seen, your only target is the mission goal. Even if you do so, you can still decide if you kill at all. You WILL be responsible for dead/capture, but you can make it kind of... third parties fault.The complete different approach is the killing spree.If you use knife, crossbow, pistol, grenades, mines and magic to the fullest extend you can do incredible cool things.You can freeze time and put a grenade in the hand of someone, take a bullet from the air, teleport behind an enemy to strangle him, send rats to eat your enemies alive or blast them against walls.You can take over a fish or another animal and use different routes, take over a human and walk him out of the sight of others, reprogram towers to kill your enemies and so much more.So you can either play the I-do-not-kill-guy with a good ending or the kill-all-enemies-guys with a bad or at least dark ending.Either way, the game is fantastic.I really love the graphics, I love the music and the gameplay is very smooth and fun.The only thing which is not so good: the character faces are... don't know.. kind of ugly. All of them.This game is a must play. At least once! I did 2012 the killer-guy playthrough, 2014 the ghost - not in all levels :( - playthrough and now I will have some fun with mindless killing again :) "

												Just finished my first completion of Dishonored.  I was trying for as bloodless as possible and I had many flashbacks remembering the Thief series while playing.  It's not the same game or story but being able to sneak around through a game again is so much fun.  No moss or water arrows but that's good because they got to be a bit silly with that.As it stands, you have a massive number of options for completing your objectives in Dishonored.  You like rooftops?  You can be Spidey.  The sewers and maintenance areas feel more comfortable?  Crawl away!  The myriad paths and the optional side missions make some of the missions exceedingly long when you don't know the maps but they are still all enjoyable.  I can see real opportunities for speed runs when you know exactly where to go but you'd miss so much of the content.  The story is well done and detailed with believable characters though the end is a bit overdone.  Even many of the NPCs are almost fully fleshed out with backstories - families, friends etc.  You will eventually hear guard conversations repeat simply because you encounter so many of them but it often pays to hang out for a minute and listen to the guards because they are chatting about optional paths or things you are interested in...if you hover around.All in all, I enjoyed the hell out of Dishonored and strongly recommend to anyone who remembers Thief or the old Metal Gear Solid when it was stealth focused.

												Dishonored is one of my all time favorite singleplayer experiences to date up there with BioShock and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. It gets high marks for replayability as there are countless ways to move towards an objective and means with which to dispatch enemies. You can complete the game killing everyone or no one - the choice is yours. Dishonored doesn't feel like it has something to prove with it's story or gameplay. (I'm looking at you BioShock: Infinite!) You are given choices and they have consequences. The stealth/combat gameplay is nothing too revolutionary but it's executed flawlessly and for me, that makes it all the more fun. (and you simply MUST get the 2 story dlc packs ""knife"" and ""witches"" as it tells a whole nother story that's just as good (even better perhaps) than thtat of the main game. I sincerely hope there's another game coming down the road set in the ""Dishonored"" universe.			"

												WOW what a game. I brought this game on sale and feel like I ripped off the developer. I have not played a great single player game in a while that I have not wanted to stop playing after a few hours. Such a great story line will keep you wanting more and it will immerse you into the world with a sympathetic connection to the characters. If this game had really high end graphics I don't think it would be as enjoyable as the simple yet beautiful art style that this has. Once you max out your Blink and Agility runes with the addition of Swift Shadow and Fleet Fighter bone charms moving around the roof tops at speed and blinking between ledges is such a great feeling. I highly recommend this game to anybody, easily worth the money. Developers really need to make more games like this 10/10.			"

												You begin the game as Corvo, Lord Protector of the Empress of Dunwall, but soon find yourself stripped of that title and imprisoned for her alleged murder. You must escape, clear your name and ultimately restore her daughter, Emily, to the throne.You'll take on a string of missions through a city riddled with plague and corruption, taking out those in power by assassination or indirect means. Each mission involves several openly designed zones, where you may freely explore to find upgrades, ammo, coin and optional objectives along the way.Both stealth and brute-force playstyles are viable, with a wide array of weaponry and powers at your disposal.  Blink instantly from point to point; possess rats and fish to tunnel your way in, or guards to walk them to a secluded area for disposal; stop time to sneak past a group of enemies or slaughter them all undetected; or just go in guns blazing.  A lot of fun, looks amazing, well-optimized, and has great level design.  Highly recommended; my single-player GOTY.			"

												Dishonored is a rarity in today's AAA video game industry. It does not treat the player as if he/she is stupid and it gives you the freedom to make the experience your own. Launching Dishonored for the first time and going through the options menu already tells the player what they can expect out of the game; the ability to shape it into what you want it to be.Are you tired of the constant nagging to get to your objective in games? *Click* Gone. Are you sick of obnoxious objective markers ruining any sense of exploration and the joy that comes with figuring things out on your own? *Click* Gone. Sick of glowing objects telling you ""THIS IS IMPORTANT AND USEFUL!"" *Click* Gone.The game itself is very good and encourages multiple playstyles. You can fight your way through the open levels or play it sneaky. You can kill everyone you see or go through the entire game without killing a single person. The game gives you a variety of tools to accomplish your goals. You can teleport short distances, possess other NPC's or small animals, summon a group of man eating rats, slow or stop time, etc. In terms of weapons you have a crossbow with various ammo types such as sleeping and incendianary darts, grenades, traps, a pistol, and more. The levels are expertly crafted and offer multiple paths and enough mass to make use of your weapons and powers. Your choices do have consequences so you need to be aware of that. My original intention was to play through the entire game without killing a soul but that changed later on in the game.  I went after a character that had nothing to do with the mission itself. I wanted that character dead because I overheard what they do for a living and it made me angry so I went out of my way to hunt them down. That piece of gameplay was one of the standout moments for me because of how unexpected it was and the attachment it made me feel towards the game world.There are 4 difficulty modes; Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. If you want a challenge I recommend playing on one of the latter two difficulties. The AI can be very stupid under Normal  and it took away from the immersion and challenge. You are allowed to change the difficulty mid game so if you feel it's too easy or too hard you don't have to start over.I enjoyed my time with Dishonored and will be giving it another playthrough switching up my tactics and making different moral choices. I was engaged from start to finish and not once did I feel the need to just rush through it and get it over with. Its length was perfect and the entire game feels consistent and very well made.			"

												MAY CONTAIN MILD SPOILERS If I had a list of the best stealth games I have ever played, Dishonored will be high on the list. Dishonored executes the stealth aspect just like I expected and even exceeded it. Why? You have ♥♥♥♥ing powers. Want to possess a person? Do it. Want to summon a horde of flesh eating rats? Do it. Dishonored gives you a lot of choices too. Go stealth or go kill everyone in sight. Kill the target or spare his/her life? All your choices will affect the story and thus the ending too.There is great satisfication when killing your target. Drop killing especially, feels awesome. But why not kill everyone in sight? You can do so without anyone even touching you (but that doesnt mean the game is easy, it isn't). Sound badass right? Yes it is. There are dissapointments though. The obvious one, as you may have known already (reading the reviews), the main story is too damn short and predictable. I finished mine in about 9 or so hours, in hard difficulty. The storyline too, for me, is too weak. I don't care about the soon-to-be empress that you are saving. She may die? I don't really care. All I want to do is to kill people. The DLCs, though, has a way way better story. Also, you get more badass powers as Daud. Who cares about summoning rats when you can summon a master assassin anytime you like? Also stopping time every few seconds is so damn awesome. Seriously, buy all the dlcs, that is how awesome it is.If you, for some reason, decide not to buy the dlcs (buy them!), the base game itself is a memorable experience. A masterpiece. So what are you waiting for? Buy Dishonored. You will be in for a real treat.			"

												I recommend Dishonored with caution. From the outside it looks like a complex stealth game and for the most part it plays well approaching it in this manner. However I think it'd be better described as a puzzler, as that's how it ends up feeling. Don't get me wrong, I have played through Dishonored twice and loved every moment of it, but I feel people looking for a game with lots of stealthy/action filled combat would be dissapointed.Each part of the story in Dishonered has various choices and decisions to make, both in what you do when you beat the section and in terms of how you get there. A couple of playthroughs are enough to explore them both. You may or may not like that the replayability of this game comes not from hours of storyline but redoing said story in various ways. Sadly you cannot replay areas with all your abilities unlocked, which is a shame as I think this would have added a lot of hours to the content.The gameplay boasts various ways to overcome situations, some of which call for a more out of the box approach. However, some of these options don't open up until nearer the end of the game so having the opportunity to do so is limited, especially when you can't replay sections with your endgame content. There are also a few challenging achievements and things to collect in the game, if you like that sort of thing.The world and lore of Dishonored is fantastic, slightly surreal and fairly unique from what we usually see in this genre of game. The characters are believable and a little quirky which is nice but also a shame as you don't get to know the majority of them well enough, I feel. Considering that a lot of decisions on how to play are based on your attachments to characters and reaction to story this is a bit of a shame, there's so much offered but you still feel left wanting a little more. Overall, if this game is on a good offer, snap it up, it's certainly worth a play through or two.			"

												+:* Clearly inspired by BioShock and Thief, both of which are very good games.* Exceptionally well realized art style.* Supernatural abilities are a whole lot of fun to use* Side missions are neat and rewards you for thinking ahead* Stealth is generally encouraged.* Level design allows for many different approaches to a target.* Very few buIIshit moments (a staple of many stealth games).-:* Corvo is OP. My only playthrough was entirely non-lethal and on the ""very hard"" difficulty, and there wasn't really ever a time where i felt challenged by the game. Consider that Corvo can teleport, see through walls, posses creatures, stop time and effortlessly render any enemy permanently dead or unconscious.* The game drops a plot twist that doesn't go anywhere. The royalists basically give up without a fight when facing you, and the game sort of misses out on a potential climax. A few more missions before you get to free Emily would be in order.Verdict: Recommended			"

												Dishonored is set in a dark Victorian Steam Punk world. You play as Corvo an assassin in service of the local empress. After her assassination a dark and gripping story begins. The world is a sort of decaying city where the economy thrives on whale oil and the strange technology is fuelled by the same oil.The game is a FPS-style stealth game but you can choose to play more action oriented. However, this is not an action shooter! So no machine guns, rocket launchers, …Your primary weapon is a sword and secondary a pistol and crossbow (for silent kills). Next to that you have grenades, mines and that’s it. Ammo is limited. You also dispose of several magic (super natural) abilities. By playing the game you will find objects (runes, coins…) to buy new abilities.When you play you can choose different ways to complete the levels. Go stealth mode and try to kill no one or as little as possible or choose to play more action style.I find the level design impressive, with a nice and original graphic style. The acting is also quite good. It took me 19 hours to complete the game.I can also confirm that the game runs perfectly on ultra-wide displays in 21/9 aspect ratio. I tested it on a 2560*1080 resolution.I highly recommend this game!			"

												Dishonored is a great stealth game that also allows a non-stealth approach to completing missions. The addition of supernatural powers enables different playstyles and the outstanding level design enables a lot of exploration and provides different paths to reaching objectives. The chaos mechanic is an interesting one: it makes the game respond to how you act. If you choose a more violent approach (killing lots of enemies) the chaos level in the city will be high and the environment will change accordingly (there will be more enemies and rats), as will the outcome of the story. A less lethal playstyle will have a more positive outcome. This contributes to the game's replay value. Some have criticized this aspect of the game, claiming that going for a non-lethal approach makes the game boring, because there are only two ways of dealing with enemies: knocking them out or using sleep darts. I turned the non-lethal approach into a challenge to completely avoid enemies as much as possible, without knocking them out or alerting them, and see how far I can progress in that manner, which made it an interesting challenge. However, it is true that there are far more ways to deal with enemies in a violent manner.The two story DLCs (Knife of Dunwall and Witches of Brigmore) are not continuations of the main story but provide an interesting addition. They have three missions each and introduce a couple of new abilities.Dunwall City Trials DLC is not story-based, instead it comes with 10 different challenges that test the player's skill in stealth, agility, ability to quickly perform assassinations etc. The achievements are pretty difficult to get.Overall I would strongly recommend the game: it has a great level design and a great story with multiple endings, and it allows the player to approach it as a stealth game or as a more action-oriented game.

												Linear, open-level design done right. It reminds me a lot of Deus Ex where you're given a choice of a stealth or a lethal approach, and you're also given so much freedom in how you tranverse through each level. The world is dark, engaging, and full of intrigue. The watercolor-like art style is unique, and gives a lot of character to the world. The supernatural powers are mechanics seen nowhere else, as you're able to scale buildings with ease and navigate through levels unconventionally (taking control of animals and going through sewer pipes). The developers managed to create a tightly-designed game that avoids needless pandering or padding while giving the player so much freedom to tackle objectives.			"

												Lovely game. It was one of the more interesting stealth games when it game out.There are some interesting aspects to this game that makes it good. The fact that the same guy who designed City 17 in HL2 made Dunwall (the city in Dishonored). The fact that the whole city runs on whale oil opposed to electricity, therefore all the textures are very water colored and desaturated, this results in an amazing overall aesthetic. The fact that every single character in this game is hideous on purpose.The gameplay is good but not amazing. It does a great job in making you feel like you are cheating by using your blink ability and high agility. The levels are quite big and there is a fair amount of exploration (also the loading screens are incredibly fast, so transitioning from an area to another is blinking fast :D).I wasn't a big fan of the binary good\evil ending, however the journey impressed me. Every single area you find yourself in has it's own personality and is highly memorable.And on top of all that, it allows you to play non lethal, finishing the game without killing a single living thing (except rats, ♥♥♥♥ rats).It's a nice stylized experience and I recommend it!

												Easily one of the best games I have ever played.SImply put, the gameplay is fantastic! You are given an objective which you can execute in many different ways. The maps are also wide open for you to explore so either you go in guns blazing or you sneak in through many different paths. It really allows you to get creative!The only thing that I didn't like is that it was rather short for one playthrough. But there is reaplay value and other stuff, not to mention the absolutely great and detailed levels.Easily put, one of the best games I've ever played.			"

The Game: Dishonored is a very fun stealth-based first-person objective-based game; with the option to explore other areas on most maps. You play as Corvo, a man framed for the murder of the Empress. You escape prison with an unknown person’s help and meet them at their bar. After this you begin to do missions for these people; to help destabilize the current and corrupt government. There are two ways of doing any of the missions, either in High Chaos mode, in this mode you are not concerned about Stealth at all and engage in combat with anyone (who is marked as an enemy). Keep in mind if you get enough of the enemy onto you, you’ll either need to “Blink” (a magical ability Corvo has) away at a higher level (like on top of a ledge or building) and keep hidden; or you can die (quite quickly) trying to kill them all, since the men without blades will use flintlock pistols to shoot you and the men with blades want to remove your head.You can also do missions in Low Chaos mode, which may be a little “harder” and it does take a bit longer and require more patience, however in this mode you do not get detected (you must try not to anyways, otherwise it can go to High Chaos if you’re detected and decide to engage in combat). I honestly recommend playing the game while trying to achieve “Low Chaos” since this mode is the most fun (in my honest opinion). Other than those few things there is Corvo’s signature blade, which is equipped in your right hand – in Corvo’s left hand you can equip various things from magical abilities (like the previously mentioned “Blink” ability), various types of grenades, and finally, Corvo's crossbow (with various types of darts including ones that only put the enemy to sleep, helping your “Low Chaos” Score as that doesn’t count as a death (they’re only asleep)). Overall: All-in-all I believe Dishonored is a great game with an amazing story and characters. It surprised me that Arkane Studios (the developers behind Dishonored) were able to pull off such an amazing game, especially since before this game I’d never heard of Arkane Studios in my life. Either way, the game runs very well as it utilizes the Unreal Engine 3, so most PC’s that were made in the past five years (as of 2015) should be able to run this game with no real issues. To be safe, make sure your PC is a 2012-2015 model; this way you can play anything that is out, including the newer more graphical games (W3, GTAV, UE4 Games, etc.) I believe that anyone with either patience or the skill to kill several enemies before disappearing and reappearing to finish them off, then Dishonored is for you!Score: 4/5 – An amazing game with a very fun and interesting Story and Stealth Mode.

												This is an awesome game 10/10 no doubt. You can play it how you like, but if you want a totally different game just play it in stealth mode, it's more challenging and you have to think before you act which is great and it will take longer to finish it... and if you have time to read the notes and books just do it, you'll know even more about the story, and it's the perfect time to play it once again and freshen up the story a bit because Dishonored 2 is almost here!

												Lovely game. It was one of the more interesting stealth games when it game out.There are some interesting aspects to this game that makes it good. The fact that the same guy who designed City 17 in HL2 made Dunwall (the city in Dishonored). The fact that the whole city runs on whale oil opposed to electricity, therefore all the textures are very water colored and desaturated, this results in an amazing overall aesthetic. The fact that every single character in this game is hideous on purpose.The gameplay is good but not amazing. It does a great job in making you feel like you are cheating by using your blink ability and high agility. The levels are quite big and there is a fair amount of exploration (also the loading screens are incredibly fast, so transitioning from an area to another is blinking fast :D).I wasn't a big fan of the binary good\evil ending, however the journey impressed me. Every single area you find yourself in has it's own personality and is highly memorable.And on top of all that, it allows you to play non lethal, finishing the game without killing a single living thing (except rats, ♥♥♥♥ rats).It's a nice stylized experience and I recommend it!

It feels a lot like a perfect blend of Thief, Hitman, Deus Ex and BioShock. It takes all the aspects that are interesting and fun about those great series and smashes them all together into this glorious concoction. And the visuals are absolutely fantastic, both in design and graphical fidellty. Everyone should play this game. :)			"

												Dishonored is a great stealth game that also allows a non-stealth approach to completing missions. The addition of supernatural powers enables different playstyles and the outstanding level design enables a lot of exploration and provides different paths to reaching objectives. The chaos mechanic is an interesting one: it makes the game respond to how you act. If you choose a more violent approach (killing lots of enemies) the chaos level in the city will be high and the environment will change accordingly (there will be more enemies and rats), as will the outcome of the story. A less lethal playstyle will have a more positive outcome. This contributes to the game's replay value. Some have criticized this aspect of the game, claiming that going for a non-lethal approach makes the game boring, because there are only two ways of dealing with enemies: knocking them out or using sleep darts. I turned the non-lethal approach into a challenge to completely avoid enemies as much as possible, without knocking them out or alerting them, and see how far I can progress in that manner, which made it an interesting challenge. However, it is true that there are far more ways to deal with enemies in a violent manner.The two story DLCs (Knife of Dunwall and Witches of Brigmore) are not continuations of the main story but provide an interesting addition. They have three missions each and introduce a couple of new abilities.Dunwall City Trials DLC is not story-based, instead it comes with 10 different challenges that test the player's skill in stealth, agility, ability to quickly perform assassinations etc. The achievements are pretty difficult to get.Overall I would strongly recommend the game: it has a great level design and a great story with multiple endings, and it allows the player to approach it as a stealth game or as a more action-oriented game.

												I played this game on the free weekend. I was able to complete the main story with alot of exploring within 10 hours. This game is brilliant and I really enjoyed it throughout. Already after 2 hours playtime I decided that I will buy the complete edition with all the DLC. Can't wait for my second playthrough and this time I will try to be as stealthy as possible and get all achievements. This game easily made it into my top 10 of the best singleplayer games I've ever played. Sometimes it really reminded me of Half-Life, with similar puzzle styles and the environment. I recommend this game to everybody who liked games such as Half-Life, BioShock and similar titles. I would say this game is worth the full price, but if you can wait get it when it's on sale. It usually goes 75% down.			"

												Alright, Dishonored.Dishonored is a masterpiece. It is not only well-rounded, but also replayable, making it an extremely fun assasin-style game. However, its combat system is also up to par, so it doesn't even need to be an assasin game if you don't want it to be.Graphics:The graphics in Dishonored blew me away. They are not boring and ultra-realistic, but instead a styled, almost caricature-like moving painting. They still, however, manage to have the perfect balance of realistic...ness. If you're worried about this being immersion-breaking, don't be. Nothing in this game is immersion-breaking.Story and characters:While the story is somewhat linear, there are always options, no matter how small, that give you rewards or punishments in varying degrees. There are a few characters with interesting personalities, but there are also some relatively dull ones. Nothing horrible, just something once in a while that annoys you slightly. Gameplay:The gameplay is exceptional. With good AI, fluid motions and movement, and a seamlessly integrated combat menu system, I don't even know what else to ask for. The supernatural abilities add another layer of good, chewy gameplay. There are an extremely large number of ways to complete each mission, and you can even go through the entire game without killing anyone.Well. That sounded professional.			"

												Dishonored is a very fun game and has a great story. It has a lot of replay value because you can do every level in so many different ways. I've spent atleast 10 hours on the Lady Boyle mission because it's fun trying to complete it in different ways. The executions are brutal so you may want to complete it atleast 2 times to see them (If you want to play stealthy aswell).  The DLC adds 2 short stories to the game where you get to play as Daud. Daud is a great character and has a few more spells than Corvo. He can summon allies and his blink stops time when he isn't moving. The Dunwall City Trials DLC is pretty fun and very challenging and has a horde mode which is amazing. I can't wait for the second game. The only problem I have with this game is that the Guards are a bit stupid. They have detection issues but it doesn't happen much. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												It is an amazing game which lets you choose several ways to solve a problem. It is great that you can do it in so many ways and that it also  affects the story , For example: I took away a bottle whilst someone was painting another person, when I later found the painting I noticed that the bottle was not in the painting anymore. Eventhough in my first playthrough I killed almost everybody in the city (because it is the most obvious way to dispose of an enemy) I had more fun playing it through for the second time and trying not to get detected. Another great feature is that you can get information on how to complete a challenge and a sidequest by just listening to plain conversations between citizens and guards. Last but not least I adored how there are 3 different endings, for some reason I really felt that I played the game better when I actually had the best outcome.Conclusion: It is an amazing game and I would definetly recommend buying it if you like using amazing powers to sneak past or assassinate people. You can choose very distinct playstyles and therefore it feels like you are more involved in the story.9/10			"

The whole time I went gun, arrow and knife blazing though each mission and totally forgot the blink feature I will admit it was totally fun, but again that defeats the point of being a assassin.Yesterday I reinstall the game the next day I ask a friend to livestream Dishonoured, he taught me the proper use of blink and how to be a honourable assassin in each mission also gave me great tips.

												Dishonored is a title that left me with mixed feelings. While I appreciated the game's aesthetics, setting and gameplay, there are other aspects that didn't quite live to my expectations. I'll sum up briefly what I think are the most positive features as well as the negative ones. Let's start with the pros:+ Environment exploration is rewarding and satisfying. Not only there's lots of loot hidden around and some side quests, exploring is also a key element of the gameplay since there are many alternative routes available to reach the missions' goals. By looking around and being curious you'll be able to choose the way you see fit to proceed in your task from a good array of options.+ There's good freedom of action. The game gives its best if you choose a stealthy approach but if you feel like going for a fight without relaying too much on an elaborate strategy you're free to do so. Of course you'll have to face the logical consequences if you do, and you'll need all your arsenal of upgrades and powers to face an army of guards shooting and assaulting you with swords. There's always more than one way to eliminate your main targets too, so you can either be merciful with them and make them pay for their crimes by having them arrested or exiled or simply kill them, directly or indirectly.+ The powerups you unlock will reflect your playstyle. Since there are not enough runes in the whole game to unlock all the possible magic powers you'll have to choose them wisely basing on what kind of run you intend to do: if you're going with stealth and non-lethal approach you'll find the offensive abilities pretty useless, on the contrary if you are more prone to fights it will be better for you to skip some of the supporting skills.Now with the cons:- The chaos/morality system. The game evaluates the amount of chaos you leave in the world at the end of each mission, ranking it as ""low"" (few killings/no killings at all) or ""high"" (lots of blood spilled). This should theoretically afflict the game's ending but there are practically only two different endings available, which one you get is simply determined by what rank you get the most. Since you can still maintain a low chaos level by killing all your main targets and even some guard there's no real reason for trying not to kill anyone in the whole game, making the relative achievement end in itself. It's a sterile challenge that has no effect in the game story and universe.- The plot. It's very basic to say the least, I won't spoil anything but there's not much to expect. You can tell since the very beginning what's going to happen. It's still enough to give the player a reason to go out and fight, but the ending is abrupt and worst of all it gives absolutely no explanation about why the Outsider chose you, what is his real purpose and who is he really.- As a minor point, sometimes the stealth mechanics are buggy. It's a common issue with this genre of games to see guards acting dumb, not seeing you when you're right next to them or inexplicably launching an alarm where they're absolutely not supposed to see where you are. This title makes no exception, but fortunately those are pretty rare events that don't really ruin the experience.- Lastly, not really an issue but still bothering for me: lots of stupid achievements. This is a game that privileges a stealthy, no-killing approach and it's filled with combat-based achievements. Kill x enemies with this, kill y with that. It's stupid even in FPS, here is exponentially more stupid.Considering all, I would recommend Dishonored to everybody who likes stealth and exploration-focused games, with the advice to not being charmed by all the hyper-enthusiastic reviews. This game is overall good but it still has very noticeable issues, if you don't expect a masterpiece and just want to play with good stealth mechanics then go ahead and grab it (preferably on the Definitive Edition that has all DLCs included). If it's a good, captivating story and memorable characters you're looking for then leave it alone.			"

												Alright, Dishonored.Dishonored is a masterpiece. It is not only well-rounded, but also replayable, making it an extremely fun assasin-style game. However, its combat system is also up to par, so it doesn't even need to be an assasin game if you don't want it to be.Graphics:The graphics in Dishonored blew me away. They are not boring and ultra-realistic, but instead a styled, almost caricature-like moving painting. They still, however, manage to have the perfect balance of realistic...ness. If you're worried about this being immersion-breaking, don't be. Nothing in this game is immersion-breaking.Story and characters:While the story is somewhat linear, there are always options, no matter how small, that give you rewards or punishments in varying degrees. There are a few characters with interesting personalities, but there are also some relatively dull ones. Nothing horrible, just something once in a while that annoys you slightly. Gameplay:The gameplay is exceptional. With good AI, fluid motions and movement, and a seamlessly integrated combat menu system, I don't even know what else to ask for. The supernatural abilities add another layer of good, chewy gameplay. There are an extremely large number of ways to complete each mission, and you can even go through the entire game without killing anyone.Well. That sounded professional.			"

												Dishonored.There is a lot to say about this great masterpiece of a game.A game you can decide how you want to compled it , as a silent or brutal killer. Or just be a stealty tactical player who finishes the game without killing someone. The game catches you with his great atmosphere and great charakter desinge.If you play the game you´r 100% in the game and you won´t notice anything else.If you don´t want to play the game full stealth you got a big arsenal of weapons or powers to slay everything that stands in your way. Seeing how the world corrups if you choose the way of a killer and the story changes is just amazing. A game that don´t get boring if you play it multiple times ! Story 7/10Atmophere 9,5/10Charakterdesigne 8,5/10Gameplay 10/10 controls 8/10 Graphic 8/10 (for a 2012 game)I would recomend this game to everyone who like sneeky games or just want to slaughter a few people with a huge arsenal of weapon and power.

												While I don't find as good as other people say, I still find it as a great game and I do have my reasonsFirst of all the good:+ I love the Steampunk setting+ All of the weapons are useful and are fun to use, my fav being the Crossbow+ Lots of powers+ Fantastic weather effects+ Chaos system is a good idea+ Some fun levels+ Runes and Bones are fun to find+ Dat mask+ REALLY FAST LOAD TIMES AND I MEAN FAST!Downsides:- Stealth has been glitchty for me, before you say your doing it wrong, I compeleted MGS 1,2 3, 3DS, 4, twin snakes and Peacewalker all on Euro extreme/hardest setting stealth, no alerts and no kills, so I know stealth. But here, guards keep popping out of no where, and dark vision does f*ck all to see them, I know it has a range, BUT WHEN THE RANGE IS 2CM, THEN WE HAVE AN ISSUE, other then that, Stealth CAN work sometimes, most of the time guards just insta spot me while I'm hiding in the shadows, so I'm forced to go in guns blazing 75% of the time.Also smashing glasses does f*ck all, not joking, I smashed a glass in a guards face and he did nothing, didn't move, didn't attack until I walked infront of him....- The Story is unintresting, while in the beginning it plays the obvious parent is gonna die and the child is gonna be kidnapped card, thats the only intresting thing, rest of it is boring and I keep finding myself skipping them.- Some powers are no where as good as the others, like I mentioned Dark vision works whenever it feels like it, Blink is broken and is the only power you should use, freezing time while fun, is only good for escapes or quick kills, Devoring Storm is nearly useless, and the Wind Power is decent.- Some cutscenes can't be skipped, while others can..... why?- All company logos can't be skipped.... why?Other then that, this game is a lot fun.

												I absolutely loved it. This is a great stealth combat game. It has a detailed and well constructed world, a great story (or stories, as the expansions give you another great storyline running concurrent with the original), memorable characters, and interesting challenges and achievements. Also, if you aren't turned off by binary moral choice systems you can play through each story multiple times. You should also definitely get the game of the year addition 'cause the expansions are absolutely worth it.A word to the wise, you should probably decide before you start whether you plan to be good or to do some of the longer achievements like Ghost cause you can't start after the fact.

												The steampunk action game I've always wanted.Dark, stylish, clever, exciting and diverse, Dishonored offers a unique and beautifully realized world packed with character and visual flair, while arming you with an exceptional variety of enjoyable gameplay mechanics with which to explore it and a freedom with which to use them very reminiscient of Deus Ex.On top of the excellent quality of the game itself, its unique art style has resulted in fairly low system overhead, and while the graphics options ingame are limited, I found there wasn't really any tweaking needed as the game ran like a charm out of the box.A must-have for steampunk fans and Deus Ex fans alike, and if you're a fan of both, I hope this is already in your library.

												This is a great game. It combines the multiple paths of classic games like Hitman, Deus Ex, and Thief with fantastic stealth and combat systems. You can be a total pacifist if you want, but if you do choose to kill, there are plenty of great ways to do it: stealthy assassinations, epic swordfights, carefully placed traps, crossbows and guns, or even just summon a huge swarm of rats to eat your enemies alive. Levels are huge. There's plenty of gold to find and safes to open. You are rewarded for exploring your environment instead of just focusing on the end goal. The game is quick to learn but hard to master. Easy enough that you won't have any trouble beating the game, but deep and difficult enough that there's always a new challenge offered. The plot isn't terribly great, but it's still pretty good. Enemy design is fantastic. Graphics won't have you gasping in awe, but they get the job done.The game's only flaw is that it doesn't really do anything new. There are plenty of games similar to Dishonored. But what it does do, it does really well. It may not be groundbreaking, but it's still a solid game with tons of replayability. Perfect for the gamer who likes to set challenges for themselves, as well as players who found the original Hitman/Thief/Deus Ex games inaccessible. Definitely buy it.			"

Agent 47 meets Ezio Auditore and Booker de Witt in City 18Again, one of my reviews:in shortThis game blends quite succesfully a First Person Hitman experience with the verticality of Assassin's Creed's Ezio Auditore. There is an evolved version of Bioshock's Plasmids which don't just copy the BS ones. The art director is the same as in Half-Life 2 and sadly sometimes you feel really like in a City 17 clone a century before. Through a Low/High Chaos system, the game ensures that there is a stealth approach, as well as a ""standard"" FPS one and provides the enemy spawns needed. It caters to the Fantasy community, but after the first 2 chapters, it is even for someone like me playable. Recommend it, if you like stealth games, though w/o frustration due to supernatural powers and blood & gore approach possibility.Recommend yes, but a 87-90 meta score would have been more than enough: Entertaining and a nice blend but nothing too special; still one of the better games, I guess.in detailstoryHm, personally I am not a Fantasy person and not really into empresses, mana and haunted castles, so forgive me being biased towards this game, but as mentioned, I nearly skipped the whole game after meeting the empress and all of that Outsider's gibberish. I collected all audio tapes (or Voxophones) in Bioshock, which added greatly to the atmosphere and gave insides. Here, this abundance of audio diaries, notes and books either merely state the obvious or are simply boring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t which is only loosely connected to the main story. Sometimes hints are buried under these tons of ""paper"". - The overall story is ok though and the characters themselves got personality, just the collectibles are hastily done.Voice-acting itself is brilliant, but the dialogues are flat but getting better towards the end. Background score is another plus.gameplaypositive:leaves many options and approacheseven in hardest achievement combo, w/o killing nor alerting anyone, nor using superpowers not frustrating (on normal)side quests are well integrated into the main story - this is a huge plus and only the Half-Life franchise manages that from what I played so farfew but distinguishable weapons and gadgets which I prefer over tons of the samenegative: very short in a blood & gore approachunlike Assassin's Creed not open world at all - cannot understand some comments which state otherwise. nothing really exciting level design-wise. Get from low ground to high ground and back down again unlike Notes, Books don't disappear after being picked up and are often double, which is a pain when leaving all cover just to find out, you already got that one. Obviously should help to collect them, but no good approach.graphicsReally, have to be mentioned because this might be the most controversial part of my review and again, before you downvote my review for not being helpful, please accept my personal view on this:I found the graphics unlike HL2 very kitchy and the coffin like structures everywhere were a too unsubtle reminder of the overall plague situation in Dunwall. Besides, the citadel structures next to the Boyle estate made me looking for Alyx & Dog; sorry this was too much of copying City 17. Besides, and this is non controversial, the graphics also feel as dated as in HL2 and this was 10ys ago. Ok, one or two sunsets doesn't make much of a difference. The characters lack polygones, but this is nicely compensated for by using caricature like expressions.Again, the ♥♥♥♥♥ are a disgrace like in any American video game's brothel: No♥♥♥♥♥♥or♥♥♥♥♥♥to see as usual but at least some shiny tattoos.Why is it an adult game then - nipples are worse than chopped off heads or what?bugs/etc.The game itself seems ok, but I had massive bugs in the Steam overlay due to failing synchronisation which caused game critical bugs (as in killing the game). Exiting and re-entring Steam helped as a workaround. Luckily, this only happened once in-game.			"

												Such a good story with an exceptional gameplay. Dishonored makes me emphatise Lord Corvo and feel the betrayal that he has got. The story has bunch of detailed side characters which their fate is written by the choices of us. Also there are dozens ways of approach to a target wheter you kill or neutralise him/her. Good DLC's, good story, amazing gameplay, also it runs at the highest setting at my pc which even cant run cs go properly(smokes give me CANCER). I recommend this game highly.			"

												Dishonored is a first-person game that takes place in a steampunk setting, in the city of Dunwall, after being framed for the murder of an Empress, you must clear your name and make things right, and at the same time dealing with those that conspired against you... The game is gorgeous visually, so many details you may not even notice, between level design and architecture and items, superb... I love the gameplay, the weapons, the abilities (personally, I use Dark Vision and Blink the most), the choice between stealth or straight-up murder, justice or revenge, the mechanics of this game are incredible... I have played through the game both stealthily, not killing anyone, not being detected in a low-chaos  way, as well as a kill everyone and everything and be a major jerk in a high-chaos way, and both can be equally as fun... The story, while somewhat predictable, is still quite compelling and enjoyable... and everything you do affects which way the story goes, if you choose to behave in a good-natured way, you will have a good ending... if you are of ill-intent, your story will become dark... The characters are great, you play Corvo, Lord Protector of the Empress, along the way you come across some other very fascinating people, Emily, Samuel, Havelock, Pendleton, Martin, Piero, The Outsider, Granny Rags, and many others... Overall, I absolutely adore this game, everything about it, I love to explore every area, every item I can find, and various paths to my goal, brilliant game! 10/10, highly recommended!EDIT: as of Feb 23, 2016, I have played through this game multiple times, and its DLCs, and have collected every achievement to 100%, so you can take my word for it, I have played everything thoroughly ;)			"

												I originally thought that Dishonored was an open world RPG similar to Skyrim or Fallout, but it turns out that it’s actually closer to Deus Ex Human Revolution (action/stealth). Since I only had the free weekend to finish the game I didn’t try to go for all the achievements that I normally would. However, the game lets you know right from the start that the fewer people you kill, the better the outcome will be. That means no hacking and slashing like I was planning to. In the game you play Corvo, the chief bodyguard of the empress. When the empress is killed and her daughter kidnapped, you get framed for the crime and sentenced to death. Your main goal in the game is to rescue the daughter and bring the actual murderers to justice.  Since the bad guys are high up in the government, this means you’ll mostly be fighting government soldiers and religious zealots. You’re not alone in your quest since a magical being called the Outsider gives you powers that you can use to complete your objectives. The game does a lot of its background storytelling through notes and books that you run across all over the place. The Dishonored world seems to be roughly 1800’s technology with magic thrown in, resulting in a steampunk environment. The graphics are very similar to the Bioshock games (including that annoying blur effect when you walk through falling water).As I alluded to earlier, Dishonored is not really an RPG. You don’t gain experience or level up. There’s no big reason to kill or knock out enemies if you can just sneak around them (unless you want them out of the way for exploration). Your magic powers are upgraded by finding “runes” throughout the game world. Each rune acts like a skill point that you can use to gain or improve your magic powers. The main power you’ll be using is Blink, which is a short range teleport, which is great for getting around and avoiding enemies. The magic powers are generally not “offensive” meaning you’re not throwing fireballs or shooting lighting. Generally they’re for supporting your stealth (see through walls, killed enemies disintegrate, turn into a rat). Almost all your objectives have multiple solutions. You can run through fighting (not recommended) or find various hidden paths like climbing roofs or going through small tunnels. Similar to Deus Ex, when you sneak up on an enemy you can choose a non-lethal takedown or assassinate. Then you need to hide the body since enemies will raise alarm if they find dead or unconscious buddies lying out in the open. There is also a combat system which includes guns and the sword (you can block enemy sword swings). Since I played stealth, I didn’t engage in very much combat. And since I didn’t do a lot of fighting, my ammunition filled up really fast. You can hold a small number of healing/mana potions and arrows/bullets for your weapons. Overall Dishonored is great and well worth your time. However I wouldn’t say it’s “must play” like some others (Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider 2013, etc.). If you’re not into stealth games you will probably get annoyed at times when the enemy random patrols just don’t give you a chance to sneak past. I’ve read online that some people thought the game’s story was weak. It’s not amazing but not bad either. The story mostly just drives the gameplay and tells you where to go. I managed to finish the game during the free weekend a few days ago and it took roughly 16 hours, probably because I was going for no-kills and no-detection. Failed both by the way :(  "

Stands tall on its gameplay, visuals and setting. Disappoints with a predictable main storyline.*Spoiler free. Combined review discussing Dishonored, Dunwall City Trials, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches.*I've never been a fan of the silent protagonist. Dishonored and its two DLCs, ""The Knife of Dunwall"" and ""The Brigmore Witches"" present an interesting opportunity to play as both a silent and a voiced protagonist within essentially the same game. The main game has you playing as Corvo Attano who has a backstory but is otherwise a blank slate for you to control. Both DLCs put you behind the eyes of Daud, an assassin that you first run in to as Corvo. It would have been jarring to suddenly strip Daud of the voice he had in the original game, so he retains it into the DLCs and, in my opinion, they are better for it.As Corvo, you sit and listen as characters monologue at you or talk to each other. As Daud, you have conversations, relationships and motives of your own. Giving your protagonist a voice makes him or her interesting, allows for natural conversations and doesn't force the game's writers to avoid lines that would normally elicit a response. And it doesn't come at the cost of robbing players of making choices at key moments, as the DLCs demonstrate.There are positives to get to, but let me get through one more negative first. Dishonored's primary story and characters are mostly predictable, standard fare. NPCs are limited to the aforementioned monologues that are generally kept short in favor of gameplay. Both DLCs are significantly better in this regard but don't expect RPG levels of depth. The voice acting, however, is all around excellent.The main attraction of Dishonored is its gameplay. It's a fusion of stealth, parkour, magic, and both melee and ranged combat. All slickly delivered from a first-person perspective. Besides the blink spell (short range teleport), you are given the choice of what spells and upgrades you want to unlock first to best match your play style. There are two general play styles that result in different endings to the game: the nonlethal (often stealthy) ""low chaos"" path and the ""high chaos"" path that revels in death and battle. This is true in the DLCs as well. Whichever style you choose, the level design will allow you numerous ways to get around and sometimes multiple ways to accomplish an objective. Game length can vary wildly with high chaos being the quicker route.While Dishonored's story may be lackluster, the atmosphere of the world it takes place in is wonderful. The art and sound design both excel at bringing this place to life. The soundtrack takes a more subtle, atmospheric approach that gets the job done but is otherwise unremarkable. You'll find notes and books scattered throughout the game that fill in the details of what goes on in this world. I hesitate to list this as a complaint, but there is a spell that significantly alters how the world looks for the worse but is so useful that I rarely turned it off. It allows you to see enemies through walls while tinting everything orange (similar to the Batman Arkham games' detective mode).Dunwall City Trials is exactly what it sounds like it is: purely gameplay. No story, no impactful player choices, just arcade style pursuit of high scores. I would suggest replaying the rest of the game at a different chaos level than your first playthrough and then if you're still hungry for more, play these.Dishonored: 7/10 --- 16 hours*Dunwall City Trials: 5/10 --- 3 hours*The Knife of Dunwall: 8/10 --- 6 hours, no alerts or kills*The Brigmore Witches: 8/10 --- 7 hours, no alerts or kills* (* estimated playtime for my single low chaos playthrough) "

												I must admit that this has to be one of my favorite games i have ever played. I beat the game first killing everyone, I didnt like the outcome I got however (dont get me wrong, it was still decent, but was really dark)Just now I have finished completing the game with ""clean hands"", and i got to tell you. It is 100% worth it. I loved the ending for that, and was completely worth the second playthrough back-to-back.The game within its self is fantastic too I might add, has good mechanics, a good concept of things like magic, but the storyline easily takes the cake.I would not trade the experience I had with this game for anything, and cant wait for Dishonored 2.10/10			"

Story was very sad and game was better when not paying attention to story. Multiple outcomes was cool add! There was much more to do in the game but I only played on free weekend so didn't get experience all.I recommend to all, not too sensitive about stories that have deception, illness and murder.			"

But make sure you buy the DLC ""Dishonored - The Knife of Dunwall"" and ""Dishonored: The Brigmore Witches"" and play them in order, instead of backwards like I did.  Lol.  I bought and played ""Dishonored: The Brigmore Witches"", then realized that The Bridmore Witches is a continuation of ""Dishonored - The Knife of Dunwall"".  Oh well.			"

												Here are the essentials that you should know about the game: It is a first-person stealth action game set in a steampunk industrial city infested with a plague (except that everything runs on whale oil instead of steam. The city inherits the city-on-a-coast that is slowly falling apart while a ruling class harasses the citizens vibe from City 17 (Half-Life 2) mixed with the steady unveiling of stories and details through books and audio recordings from Rapture (Bioshock). So the setting is already off to a good start, as I enjoyed both of those games immensely.As was revealed to us before the game came out, you play as Corvo Attano, the Empress' body guard. In the first scene the empress is assassinated, her daughter is kidnapped, and you are framed for it. Not the most original plot, I know, but you really do get caught up in it. Before they can execute you of course you escape with the help of a group loyal to the true heir and the rest of the game is the story of your revenge.Of course, the way that you go about exacting your revenge is entirely up to you. It is entirely possible for you to go in guns blazing and murder everyone in your path; it is also possible for you to kill almost no one throughout the whole game. You can even deal with most of the main targets in a nonlethal manner. The way you play affects several things in the game: the more people you kill, the more rats and plague victims there will be, and the ending of the game will be darker. This concept of giving you a moral choice within a linear framework reminds me once again of Bioshock.I opted to try to kill as few people as I could, partly because it is a refreshing change of pace from most video games, and partly because I knew that the guards that I was encountering didn't know the truth and were just following orders.Corvo has some pretty nifty gadgets at his disposal, including a folding blade, a crossbow, a pistol, rewiring tools, razor mines, and grenades. Oh, and of course his mask.The guards in this game aren't completely clueless, so sneaking around them undetected is actually pretty challenging until you start getting awesome supernatural powers from The Outsider. This guy lives in The Void, which is the otherworldly realm where everything magical comes from. He apparently seeks out interesting people to give powers to in order to see what they will do with their powers.  He kind of reminds me of the G-Man (Half-Life) but he manages to be creepy in a whole different way.The powers he gives you include things like short-range teleportation, seeing things through walls, stopping time, possessing animals, and creating a giant swarm of rats that will devour people.Both your gear and powers are upgradeable; for gear you collect money and supplies during your missions and bring them back to Piero to have him give you new goodies; for powers you collect whale bone runes and you can select a power to acquire as soon as you have enough runes.Being that you are the Empress' body guard and her daughter was abducted, one of your main goals is to ensure Emily's safety. I am noticing that this is a rapidly emerging theme in video games: The Walking Dead, Dishonored, Bioshock Infinite, and The Last of Us all have grown men as the player character with a young girl they must protect.There are a few things that I have to complain about, but they are relatively minor notes:The game isn't quite as long as I was expecting. I was almost expecting another plot twist that would keep the game going, but it really was the end.It isn't the most graphically impressive game I've seen. It makes up for it with a unique art style.""Player choice"" and ""many routes to your goal"" doesn't mean open world.$60 seems like too much. $40 would be a much more reasonable price.			"

Game is a bit short. Possible to win it in a day if you want to, but the game has such a high replayability that the length of the game sorta becomes irelevant. There are so many different ways of doing the game. Stealthy by climbing trough the roof tops, kicking down the front door, crawl trough the sewers. All those ways are possible just to get in somewhere. Posses a rat or a guard to get pass other guards or gates. Use blink to do a quick escape or to get to a roof to another. The possibilities are great. I highly recommend it to anyone. Great game.			"

												I tried Dishonored back when it first came back on the 360 and while I thought it looked cool and sounded cooler; it just didn't grab me.  It kept nagging at me though because I thought it was definitely a game I should like.  I gave in during the summer sale and and I’ll be honest; I hit a point at the very beginning where it still didn't grab me.  This time, I pushed through my frustration and it turns out, I love this game! I was totally caught up in the story and I really dug Korvo.  I was even caught a bit by surprise by the twists and turns that happen.  Hell, I even fell in love with the world of Dunwall and the side stories you find in all the books that you collect along the way.  The Outsiders powers are fun though I really only used Blink and The Ash powers, but they fit well with the combat they've built into the game.  Early on, it was the fact that they give you wide open maps and leave it up to you to figure out how to get get through them that overwhelmed me.  Once I figured out that the key to playing Dishonored is to explore and make your own way, the game really opened up for me and turned into something special.			"

												I was waiting for Dishonored to come out. Waiting and hoping. It had so much potential. A pseudo-victorian steampunk dystopia, a supernatural menace, a tale of revenge. The animated Tales of Dunwall shorts caught my breath. They were making a game for me. And then it came out. And I wasn't disappointed. I'm terrible at stealth games, but they knew that so they gave me magic powers to solve that conundrum. My computer was broken, so they used a cartoony but subdued visual style which didn't cause my hardware to explode. They knew I loved complex supernatural mysteries, so they gave me just enough Lore to digest that I could piece together a searing cosmic revelation. And they gave me a little girl to save, whose unshaped persona showed me how my actions were effecting the world. As I moved from inspired setpiece to inspired setpiece and nonlethally punished insidious villain after insidious villain, I knew I'd be coming back with a sack full of grenades to try it again, once more with feeling.Play this game, and don't forget the DLC which serves as an excellent accompaniment to the original story.

												A game of love, hate and betrayal, Dishonored's storyline and dialogue are a cut above and the art style - while naturally a matter of taste - is strong, consistent and I think beautiful in its exagerrated, oil-paint fashion. The time you spent in Dunwall fighting for the future of the empire and her empress will stick with you, long after the game is complete. This city has personality and flavour - it feels like a place, not a set of repeating assets.You can take three paths in dishonoured. After your downfall you can remain a righteous fellow, trying to stick to your principles, or you can turn into a crazed maniac, wrecking vengeance on all who stand between you and your goal or you can tread the muddly ground inbetween. Whichever route your nature takes you, the city reflects your heart and so do some of the people closest to you - heartbreakingly, in some circumstances.The stealth, magic and combat mechanisms in Dishonoured are a joy to play with once you get comfortable with the controls. I've dabbled heavily in all three (particularly in the Dunwall City Trials DLC) and found them all to a pleasure to work with. This is quite rare - usually in stealth games the combat is a nightmare, or in combat games the stealth is a series of awkward wall-hugging moves - none of that here. The magic is straightforward, but if you don't like magic, that's okay - there's an achievement for you too, going through the game with no magical upgrades at all.Dishonoured is a love letter to the original Thief as well as being a great game in its own right. If you enjoyed Thief: The Dark Project, you'll probably enjoy this. It's easy to imagine Dunwall lying across the sea from Garrett's city - minus the burricks.			"

												This game has a little something for everyone I think.  A seemingly easy game that just wants to show you beautiful yet dark vistas that lead you back to play again... then you find you havent even met half of the challenges and must play extremely well to get the gold (ghost acheivement etc).  This one is so hard most of the challengers think they have a bug but then realize the game wont let you cheat by using multiple save technique (auto saves only folks) and doesnt care if you have to go through the game 50 times to find out ha.  The genre and atmosphere of the world make you want to live there despite the plague with its old fashioned feel amongst major social unrest and revolution.  Conspiracies to make the world shake but we of course were privy and at the leading edge of this change.... ME??? I am going to rent an appartment at the top of Dunwall tower and employ sexy maids who say... 'can I get you anything sir?', lol.  The reality of the whaling ships design would inspire (and has) some shipwrights to question current thinking.  There is nothing that cannot be improved but it's a bloody good game :)			"

												You love Steampunk and Stealth games ? Like to use different ways to achive your goal and to complete a game without even killing a single person ? Well here is your game. Dishonored combine all this in one game with a story full of tension and surprise. Music and graphic are very good (although the graphic is no match for newer games) and helps to feel the situation and the game itself.The controls, very important especially for a stealth game, are very good and easy to master.But what would a stealth game without a good A.I. ?  I for myself  was pleased with it. Not to bad and to good. The only downside could be that the gameplay is in fact always the same but the variety of the levels reduced this problem to nearly zero.All in all a very good game which everybody who is a fan of stealth games and Steampunk should buy			"

												I tried Dishonored back when it first came back on the 360 and while I thought it looked cool and sounded cooler; it just didn't grab me.  It kept nagging at me though because I thought it was definitely a game I should like.  I gave in during the summer sale and and I’ll be honest; I hit a point at the very beginning where it still didn't grab me.  This time, I pushed through my frustration and it turns out, I love this game! I was totally caught up in the story and I really dug Korvo.  I was even caught a bit by surprise by the twists and turns that happen.  Hell, I even fell in love with the world of Dunwall and the side stories you find in all the books that you collect along the way.  The Outsiders powers are fun though I really only used Blink and The Ash powers, but they fit well with the combat they've built into the game.  Early on, it was the fact that they give you wide open maps and leave it up to you to figure out how to get get through them that overwhelmed me.  Once I figured out that the key to playing Dishonored is to explore and make your own way, the game really opened up for me and turned into something special.			"

												Hither came Corvo… A reaver, a slayer and a thief.Lord protector was his title, stripped of all dignity and denied all fair justice, it is now up to you to clear his name or go down with those who were the cause to all of this.The world before you is a harsh one, a plague-ridden, rat infested dump of a city. Filled with lush-consuming nobles, bribed officials, honourless assassins and a lush for greed.With the training of a bodyguard and an assassin you must fight your way up to the top of the food-chain to be free your accusations and to save the people you care about.Without spoiling, one mission that often comes to mind when I think of this game is “the ball”.Sneak around disguised among other masked high-class and try to talk and lure your way into the secluded areas, make new friends and find out the latest gossips amongst nobles.Dishonored is truly a game worth mentioning, it takes the stealth-genre into a new era with more fast pace combat and a replayability never seen before. Emerge into a world that is very much convincing and chose a path that you decide.			"

												Played it too much on my ps3. Just had to get it on steam on the sale as well. This is with no doubt the best assassin game I have played. It is just fantastic in every way. Game is a bit short. Possible to win it in a day if you want to, but the game has such a high replayability that the length of the game sorta becomes irelevant. There are so many different ways of doing the game. Stealthy by climbing trough the roof tops, kicking down the front door, crawl trough the sewers. All those ways are possible just to get in somewhere. Posses a rat or a guard to get pass other guards or gates. Use blink to do a quick escape or to get to a roof to another. The possibilities are great. I highly recommend it to anyone. Great game.			"

												Here are the essentials that you should know about the game: It is a first-person stealth action game set in a steampunk industrial city infested with a plague (except that everything runs on whale oil instead of steam. The city inherits the city-on-a-coast that is slowly falling apart while a ruling class harasses the citizens vibe from City 17 (Half-Life 2) mixed with the steady unveiling of stories and details through books and audio recordings from Rapture (Bioshock). So the setting is already off to a good start, as I enjoyed both of those games immensely.As was revealed to us before the game came out, you play as Corvo Attano, the Empress' body guard. In the first scene the empress is assassinated, her daughter is kidnapped, and you are framed for it. Not the most original plot, I know, but you really do get caught up in it. Before they can execute you of course you escape with the help of a group loyal to the true heir and the rest of the game is the story of your revenge.Of course, the way that you go about exacting your revenge is entirely up to you. It is entirely possible for you to go in guns blazing and murder everyone in your path; it is also possible for you to kill almost no one throughout the whole game. You can even deal with most of the main targets in a nonlethal manner. The way you play affects several things in the game: the more people you kill, the more rats and plague victims there will be, and the ending of the game will be darker. This concept of giving you a moral choice within a linear framework reminds me once again of Bioshock.I opted to try to kill as few people as I could, partly because it is a refreshing change of pace from most video games, and partly because I knew that the guards that I was encountering didn't know the truth and were just following orders.Corvo has some pretty nifty gadgets at his disposal, including a folding blade, a crossbow, a pistol, rewiring tools, razor mines, and grenades. Oh, and of course his mask.The guards in this game aren't completely clueless, so sneaking around them undetected is actually pretty challenging until you start getting awesome supernatural powers from The Outsider. This guy lives in The Void, which is the otherworldly realm where everything magical comes from. He apparently seeks out interesting people to give powers to in order to see what they will do with their powers.  He kind of reminds me of the G-Man (Half-Life) but he manages to be creepy in a whole different way.The powers he gives you include things like short-range teleportation, seeing things through walls, stopping time, possessing animals, and creating a giant swarm of rats that will devour people.Both your gear and powers are upgradeable; for gear you collect money and supplies during your missions and bring them back to Piero to have him give you new goodies; for powers you collect whale bone runes and you can select a power to acquire as soon as you have enough runes.Being that you are the Empress' body guard and her daughter was abducted, one of your main goals is to ensure Emily's safety. I am noticing that this is a rapidly emerging theme in video games: The Walking Dead, Dishonored, Bioshock Infinite, and The Last of Us all have grown men as the player character with a young girl they must protect.There are a few things that I have to complain about, but they are relatively minor notes:The game isn't quite as long as I was expecting. I was almost expecting another plot twist that would keep the game going, but it really was the end.It isn't the most graphically impressive game I've seen. It makes up for it with a unique art style.""Player choice"" and ""many routes to your goal"" doesn't mean open world.$60 seems like too much. $40 would be a much more reasonable price.			"

												A game of love, hate and betrayal, Dishonored's storyline and dialogue are a cut above and the art style - while naturally a matter of taste - is strong, consistent and I think beautiful in its exagerrated, oil-paint fashion. The time you spent in Dunwall fighting for the future of the empire and her empress will stick with you, long after the game is complete. This city has personality and flavour - it feels like a place, not a set of repeating assets.You can take three paths in dishonoured. After your downfall you can remain a righteous fellow, trying to stick to your principles, or you can turn into a crazed maniac, wrecking vengeance on all who stand between you and your goal or you can tread the muddly ground inbetween. Whichever route your nature takes you, the city reflects your heart and so do some of the people closest to you - heartbreakingly, in some circumstances.The stealth, magic and combat mechanisms in Dishonoured are a joy to play with once you get comfortable with the controls. I've dabbled heavily in all three (particularly in the Dunwall City Trials DLC) and found them all to a pleasure to work with. This is quite rare - usually in stealth games the combat is a nightmare, or in combat games the stealth is a series of awkward wall-hugging moves - none of that here. The magic is straightforward, but if you don't like magic, that's okay - there's an achievement for you too, going through the game with no magical upgrades at all.Dishonoured is a love letter to the original Thief as well as being a great game in its own right. If you enjoyed Thief: The Dark Project, you'll probably enjoy this. It's easy to imagine Dunwall lying across the sea from Garrett's city - minus the burricks.			"

												I was waiting for Dishonored to come out. Waiting and hoping. It had so much potential. A pseudo-victorian steampunk dystopia, a supernatural menace, a tale of revenge. The animated Tales of Dunwall shorts caught my breath. They were making a game for me. And then it came out. And I wasn't disappointed. I'm terrible at stealth games, but they knew that so they gave me magic powers to solve that conundrum. My computer was broken, so they used a cartoony but subdued visual style which didn't cause my hardware to explode. They knew I loved complex supernatural mysteries, so they gave me just enough Lore to digest that I could piece together a searing cosmic revelation. And they gave me a little girl to save, whose unshaped persona showed me how my actions were effecting the world. As I moved from inspired setpiece to inspired setpiece and nonlethally punished insidious villain after insidious villain, I knew I'd be coming back with a sack full of grenades to try it again, once more with feeling.Play this game, and don't forget the DLC which serves as an excellent accompaniment to the original story.

												This game has a little something for everyone I think.  A seemingly easy game that just wants to show you beautiful yet dark vistas that lead you back to play again... then you find you havent even met half of the challenges and must play extremely well to get the gold (ghost acheivement etc).  This one is so hard most of the challengers think they have a bug but then realize the game wont let you cheat by using multiple save technique (auto saves only folks) and doesnt care if you have to go through the game 50 times to find out ha.  The genre and atmosphere of the world make you want to live there despite the plague with its old fashioned feel amongst major social unrest and revolution.  Conspiracies to make the world shake but we of course were privy and at the leading edge of this change.... ME??? I am going to rent an appartment at the top of Dunwall tower and employ sexy maids who say... 'can I get you anything sir?', lol.  The reality of the whaling ships design would inspire (and has) some shipwrights to question current thinking.  There is nothing that cannot be improved but it's a bloody good game :)			"

												Dishonored is stealth action game with great gameplay and a really nice world for you to explore.STORY: You play as corvo who is the main character of the game. Corvo is a bodyguard and is protecting the empress of the city dunwall. but when Corvo comes to see the empress at the very beginning of the game, the empress gets killed by assassin's and corvo is the one they blame for the murder. Then some bad people take control over dunwall and you need to make things right.The characters are also good but nothing that special.GAMEPLAY: Dishonred focuses mostly on stealth gameplay. with every mission you need to kill or neutralize a target so the good people regain something. The good thing about the gameplay of dishonored is that you can complete the missions in so many different ways. You can fire a sleepdart to make your target go to sleep for an example. or you can slice him into bits with your sword, or you can avoid all enemies and only neutralize the target. These are one of the many ways you can complete your mission. if your looking for a game with good stealth gameplay then dishonored will not disappoint.THE ENVIRONMENT: When you look at the graphics of dishonored you might think that the graphics are bad,but thats not the case. When i walk around in the world of dishonored i feel like im playing in a painting. This gives the game a really good and unique feel. The world also feels like there is really something going on.dishonored's world feels alive and is really nice to look at. CONCLUSION:  Dishonored gives you fun missions that you can complete in all kinds of ways. combine this with a good story and great gameplay and you get a really good stealth game. The missions also have a ton of replay value, so you might want to play this game for a long time if you want to get the most out of it. If your looking for a game with good stealth gameplay and a nice world for you to discover then dishonored might be the game your looking for. "

												An excellent game with a mix of stealth and action gameplay, Dishonored is set in a steampunk world with some magic thrown it it. The story is set in the Empire of the Isles, and follows Corvo, Royal Protector of the Empress, who's wrongly accused of murdering the empress and kidnapping her daugther. However, the day before his execution, he's freed from prison by a group of loyalists who seek to stop the real conspirators.The game is filled with many interesting characters, including the aforementioned loyalists, and the members of the conspiracy. There's also some mysterious characters, most notably the Outsider, who gives his mark to Corvo, granting him supernatural powers, all of which are really fun to use, and offer a nice variety, whether you go for a stealth-based approach, or want to kill everything in your path; which, by the way, are both perfectly valid ways to play this game.A great thing of the game is, like I mentioned above, the different paths it offers. And it's not as simple as two paths, you can actually approach your targets in several ways; you can even get through the whole game using only your weapons, without ever touching the powers; you can kill everybody in front of you, or you can finish the game without killing anybody, including your targets, as the game offers different ways of dealing with them. Something to keep in mind, though, is that your actions affect the world; the city in which the game takes place, Dunwall (capital of the Empire of the Isles), is afflicted by a strange plague, carried by rats, and the more chaos you cause, the more rats there are, and the more dangerous the city gets, leading to different endings depending on the overall chaos.As far as environments go, they're really good. The city is somewhat reminiscent of Half-Life's City 17, which should come as no surprise, considering that Viktor Antonov, who designed the environments for Half-Life 2, worked in this game as well. Even some of the enemies might remind you of ones encountered through Half-Life 2. However, don't think this is a bad thing; even though there are similarities, the overall tone of the game, of a steampunk nature, makes the city feel pretty unique. There's also many pathways to get through the different levels, depending, once again, on the approach you wish to take; and also many areas that you can explore, even when they're not directly related to your mission.As for gameplay, I've already talked about it in the above paragraphs. Something I haven't mentioned is that you always dual-wield your sword (on the right hand) along another weapon (or power). This leads to a very dynamic combat system, where you can attack enemies at a distance, while defending yourself in close combat. There's also several powers that allow for easier movement across the levels (from teleportation, to possessing animals, or even human NPCs), and others that give new combat options (like summoning rats to attack your enemies). Then there's the bone charms, which grant you passive effects as long as you have them equipped, enhancing your abilities.The story is excellent; as I mentioned, it starts with the death of the Empress. After Corvo escapes from prison, he joins the loyalists, and starts going against the conspirators, weakening the power of the Lord Regent, who was behind it all. Depending on what you do, you can even learn more about the plague that's destroying the city, or you can simply get your revenge on those that wronged you.So, to conclude this review, Dishonored is an excellent game. Great story, great visuals, great characters. It's become one of my favourite games, and I'm eagerly waiting for the sequel. It should be more than obvious that I recommend this game.			"

												Screw Assassin's Creed, this is what a stealth game should be like. Dishonored is a first-person stealth adventure game that casts you into the role of Corvo Attano, a former bodyguard, now turned supernatural assassin all because the Empress of the city of Dunwall has been murdered and he has been framed for her death. Everything about Dishonored is fantastic. Pros:+Enemy AI reacts to everything the player does, whether they have been seen or not.+A wide variety of skills and weaponry makes every playthrough unique - take the silent route focused on stealth, or be ruthless and slaughter everything in sight.+The art style and direction is awesome.+Actions have consequences, and some of them can be quite significant...+Excellent level design. If you can see a door in front of you, you most likely can open it. If you see a rooftop, you can climb to it. The possibilities when it comes to navigating levels are nearly endless!+Likeable cast and characters.Cons:+Some of the textures look a little outdated when viewed close up, considering how this was released in 2012.+A couple of characters exist merely as plot devices. Overall, Dishonored is a fantastic game if you can overlook what it doesn't do quite right, and maximises what it does do right. The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches DLC only adds to the sheer awesome that is this game, so I highly reccomend those too.			"

												After doing one run of the game so far, I am shocked I didn't do it sooner. Dishonored is not your average stealth game. There is a lot of freedom to it, something more games need.Stealth ain't your thing? You can straight up murder everyone in close combat and still beat the game no problem.Wanna keep your hands clean? You can go through the game without killing a single person. And still win.Wanna rely on your own abilities and not have to unlock new powers and mystical stuff? Don't worry, all you need is the first one.And you can do a mix of any option to complete the game. One can literally play the game however they want, and there is so much fun that can come out of it. The replayability value of this game is so high, and more games should be like this one. Honestly, Dishonored is one of my favorite games, and I really should have looked into it sooner.			"

You think abouther as you run along rain-slicked marble wallsand drab stone architecture, with the magicaltattoo on your hand's exterior glowing yellow and blue.DISHONORED.Framed for the murder of the beloved Rulerof the City of Dunwall, Empress JessamineKaldwin, you take the role of Corvo Attano,disgraced Royal Bodyguard-turned-deadly,supernaturally-powered-assassin.Granted a vast array of paranormally-chargedpowers by the strange, ever-watchful Outsider,the world is yours to either silently navigate tosave the city from an all-consuming plague andgovernment corruption, or for you to unleashmayhem and wreak bloody havoc upon thosewho have wronged you.Dishonored's world draws you in with its rich, meticulously-crafted nuances and mythology scattered from minute notes to unspoken baroque and gothic-styled overtones from atmosphere to architecture.Dishonored's mission and level design rankhighly in terms of effort put in and time spentmaking these levels become a reality. Eachchoice made, whether you choose to spare orkill whoever stands in your wayhas lasting consequences upon the outcome of the story, in what the game explains as 'Chaos.'Complete the game in High Chaos, and you seethe city of Dunwall plunged into a new Dark Age,based on your choices and a playthrough of aviolent killer.

This is not the first time thatyou have seen the girl in white. There was theschool dance and there was this bombshell inthe form-fitting white dress, golden bangs andher black bob-cut.

												Compareable to - Thief (stealthing based on gadgets and special powers)- Half-Life 2 (Dystopian elements: fighting a regime, propaganda streetspeakers, meeting suffering civilians along the way, an omnipresent and pressing threat - in this case a rat plague)- Hitman (you go on kill missions and have sort of a safehouse)It's story-driven, but the story for most parts revolves around neutralizing key enemies scattered around the fictional (but highly ""British""-looking) city of Dunwall. There is a kind of safehouse where you talk to allies and relax for a moment before entering hostile territories again. Your basic three approaches at all time are to stealth your way around, to knock out everyone or to kill all you see. You can finish the game without killing a single person or animal. There is one situation where I couldn't find a satisfying non-lethal way though and where I felt pressed to kill somebody. I will look at that again, maybe I missed how to do it the way I was hoping to.Rather easy. I played on ""hard"" difficulty (there was ""very hard"" too I believe). Standard stealthing mechanics. You can take out guards one by one (kill or put to sleep), drag them into dark corners and by thus slowly empty the levels of all danger. You are invisible while leaning around corners. Your special powers make you see enemies through walls, stop time for a brief moment and teleport for some distances and on rooftops and things which makes things easy. A.I. isn't the smartest and only having basic abilities (patrolling areas, cone of vision, some awareness to noise). Guards you take out are eventually replaced by others, you will see more guards either patrolling the area you've been in previously after switching back and forth to other places (with a loading screen inbetween) or see ""live"" replacements coming from where you are meant to progress to. I noticed guards being replaced one time at best - after taking the replacement down the area would stay empty.Combat is somewhat underwhelming. Enemies step up to you and will either swing their swords or stand still, aim their flintlock pistols and shoot at you. You basically do three things then: Block with your own sword (one button, blocks all sword attacks, if timed well enough your enemies are stunned and vulnerable to instant-kill animations, sometimes you'll be kicked at which breaks your block), step sidewards when pistols are aimed at you (which makes enemies holster them again rather than adjust their aim) and spam your own attack button. Enemies evade or block a hit or two, or cross swords with you, but they don't keep this up for long, you kill them rather swiftly and even easier when using your special powers. Occassionally (in particular when attacking enemies previously stunned by timed blocks) you will see a specific animation in which your character grabs their arms or something before cutting their throat. It's not looking badly or anything, it just isn't very hard or challenging or anything, no one in this game stands a chance against your character.Looks nice and fitting overall. Some textures are blurry. But it ran like a charm, I had no performance issues, and it just generally felt like a very polished game. All special powers make sense and support either stealthy or loud approaches. There is quicksaving/-loading and loading times are practically nonexistent, this way you can do everything perfectly the way you want it to be or test out some of the freedom the game gives you.I just had that one issue when getting hurt or taking control of other creatures with my special powers the various effects that go along (blurry or colored screens) wouldn't disappear too easily. That wasn't too bad since I was stealthing mainly anyway. I noticed that enabling VSynch will make these effects fade out properly. One thing that irritated me is that bodies of people you took down will just disappear. You knock out two or three guards, toss them in a trash bin or in some dark corner, come back a minute later and some of them will have simply vanished. Not sure was that was about. I was first trying to explain it with them being found by other patrols, but even when roaming nearby they would disappear, and when the game shows you your mission statistics these bodies never counted towards ""bodies discovered"". One feature I liked a lot: There is a heart (half organical, half mechanical) you can hold in your hand and which will whisper secrets to you about the location you are in or about the persons you are aiming at with it. It's voice actress sounded nice, and the way her voice was ""manipulated"" (with some kind of echo resonating around multiple times) felt intriguing. Especially the various allied NPCs you meet over and over again in your safehouse are given some good depth that way, along with talking to them or listening to ""audiographs"" (short voice recordings) made by them. I was generally caring for the characters or curious about their intentions and doings, I thought they were all neatly crafted. Aiming with the heart isn't always easy, often I heard location secrets even though I tried aiming at persons. Sadly, from the middle towards the end of the game you will keep meeting the familiar types of enemies or civilians and there is only one pool of lines for each type (and for each key character), so if you've exhausted all of them early on you won't be using the heart later on too much anymore except for key kill targets you meet for the first and only time.The game seems to have multiple endings. A set of snipplets looking towards the future of things, and how these snipplets look like seems to depend on how much you stealth around or not causing chaos to the city (mission debriefs have a ""chaos"" indicator - if you kill many people it will tell you the chaos is ""high"", and in the next missions there are presumably supposed to be more ""Weepers"" (plague victims) or rats or stuff. I was having ""low"" chaos throughout most parts of the game so I wouldn't notice. Guards, streetspeakers and other NPCs will make remarks in some instances on how brutally or peacefully you'll have advanced through the game.The game ends fairly solid though some questions are left unanswered. There is some DLC available. Not sure if those answer some of my questions. Bethesda is apparently planning of turning this game into a franchise. There is some lore background allowing to do more. There are various fictional continents, they designed a world map you can glance at several times ingame, there are texts and voice recordings giving insight into the characters, industry, politics and myths of the world circling noteably around whaling business and a world being seemingly in some kind of industrial revolution.

												Disonored is a first person stealth game. Highly atmosperic and immersive, it tells an amazing story and puts you in control throughout it's duration. The game starts out easy enough but soon after throws you into the lions den. As the title suggests, you are dishonored and stripped of your status and thrown into prison after a certain event transpires. It is here the game makes brilliant use of a stalking/cover mechanic as you are forced to escape your binds. You are able to peek around corners to remain unseen and you always have the option of a non violent approach. Sneak up behind and knock them out or bury your sword into their neck, the choice is yours. When combat is initiated, you have a plethora of options open to you. You hold your sword in your right hand and have the option of equiping crossbows, pistols and powers in your left. Careful timing of your block opens enemies up to counter attack and choose to put an arrow in their skull, blast a musket ball into their chest or finish them with your sword. There are options open to you even if you are in combat, to resolve the situation non violently if you choose. Options include sleep syringes shot from your crossbow or using your powers to disappear into the darkness. But be carefull, killing all in your path has a negative effect and can drastically change each mission and the world as a whole. Some of the powers at your disposal include a blink ability to quickly teleport and (but not limited to) conjuring a swarm of rats to attack and eat your enemies. There are several other powers but I dont want to spoil the surprise. I will say there are powers to purchase and upgrade that will suit any playstyle. You purchase powers and upgrades by finding runes hidden throughout each level. Some can be bought and others found. There is an item that puts markers on runes and charms when used so you never have to leave any behind. Charms you can collect and find, offer passive bonuses like being able to choke out an enemy faster or that make a power more potent. There are tons of charms to find so the combinations are endless. Up to 6 can be equipped at a time unless you have the DLC which allows you to equip up to 10. Between missions, you have a home base to buy equipment and upgrades. Here is where you recieve your next mission and often are given clues about side missions to complete while tackling the main. This is a large area packed with lots of goodies to find and people to talk to. The story in Dishonored is stellar. Events always unfold in first person and there are no camera shifts the break immersion. The voice acting cast has stars like Susan Sarandon and Brad Dourif just to name a couple and they do an awesome job of fleshing out their characters. There really is no complaint I can level against Dishonored. It is a masterpiece and multiple playthroughs using different tactics never dull the fun. From its beautiful graphics, story, characters, weapons, powers and atmosphere to its high replayability, there really is nothing wrong about the game. Anyone that enjoys first person games with emphasis on stealth and combat, with RPG elements sprinkled in, will enjoy Dishonored.			"

												Dishonored is one of the better assassin games I have played recently. The art design and is unique and the gameplay is outstanding. Dishonored takes place in an industrial era where someone has framed you for killing the queen and taking away her daughter. You then have to escape a jail and find your way to some allies. Then from that point on you try to redeem yourself and find the queens daughter. Throughout the game you find new unique abilites that you can choose to unlock. If you want a challenge then up the difficulty because it gets very hard. Overall the story is outstanding and again the gameplay is very good. So I would give Dishonored a 9/10. So if you are looking for a great game to buy, well it looks like you just found yourself one.			"

The gameplay is also very good and i felt that both ways, stealth and action, were equally well done.Though, the story, or at least the presentation, fell a bit short.I didn't really cared for the characters much, nor was the story presented in a way, that i was really drawn into it.Overall it's a pretty good game, which, for me, lacks a bit of story/presentation.Give it a go if you like stealthy FPS.

												Being an assassin never felt so sad. Corvo's silence is the home of coiled emotions that are merely tamed or kindled by the player's. And Dunwall: Dunwall is a place that feels so alive it could devour you; but so alive in its desolation and poision, how odd; and Dunwall's soul is ever by, but ever so elusive. Truly, in Dishonored, choosing mercy or revenge is of great consequence. Chaos is ours. Empress Emily's cruel melancholy or tender hope, echoing from our actions, will touch us; whatever joy or regret come, they be ours too. Aesthetically, the game is wonderful. Its world-design is vivid and immersive, eerie and beautiful at once; throughout, the textures are blurred so that the world appears to be painted in pastels: if we didn't know that this is in great measure due to low-res textures, we could say that the pastel-style is deliberate. The sounds, too: they wrap us with their nightmarish draperies.Now, the characters have very distinct looks: they are stylised to the point of being emblems of their heart's secrets; can we not tell, or at least surmise, from their countenances or their shapes what their marrows hide? And they are richly human, harlequin, these characters: if not our heart, then another heart may tell us of their wins and woes. And if no one else so truly, Emily, Empress Emily, does care about Corvo's compassion, or his dread touch. When we are let loose here in Dunwall, to play with its loving and its wicked inhabitants as we please, do we not ask ourselves if the chaos, grand or vanished, in our wake is our very soul's, and not Corvo's?

												Vooshka! After raving about Bioshock Infinite (BS:I), I wasn't expecting to experience another game of that quality for quite some time.  But Dishonored is AMAZING and easily BS:Infinite's equal - and that's no small compliment!!!  Comparing the two is inevitable.  If I'd happened to have played Dishonered first, I'd still be comparing them but just doing it in my  BS:I review instead.Like BS:I, Dishonered has a very richly detailed world with tons of character and characters.  As great as the storytelling and ambiance is, what sets Dishonored apart for me is the variety and excellence of gameplay:You can see the influence of games like Bioshock (guard the little girl); Half Life (same lead artist - just look at the barricades and tall boys); Thief (the stealth elements) and Deux Ex (multiple ways/paths to achieve goals).  However, it's important to note that the game doesn't feel derivative at all.  It manages to riff off all the best elements but is still very much it's own game and not a knock-off.While stealth is encouraged, you have many ways to complete an objective including going in guns blazing. The synergy of your various powers work well together and really succeeds in making you feel very ninja-esque!Pacing is also excellent.  The story and and new abilities progress fast enough that things are constantly interesting but not so fast that you're overwhelmed or lost.This is another one of those 5 star games that I just didn't want to end and is easily on my MUST BUY list!  If you haven't played it yet go buy it... NOW!I'm off to jump into the DLC...			"

												Highly enjoyable and highly recommended.  Dishonored hits stealth right on the head.  Not since the Thief series has stealth felt so good in an FPS.  More importantly, the game gives you options to play the way you want to.  You could murder every living creature in your path, or never harm a soul.  You could go in guns blazing or never be seen once.  There is no strict morality system, but is one where your actions contribute to the level of chaos in the world which ultimately affects the ending and the environment around you.The powers and weapons are satisfying, the world is refreshingly different, and the story is compelling.  Wipe the rust from your whale oil powered rig and install this game.			"

												Dishonored is a game that I almost completely missed out on. The first time I ever heard dishonored was when I was looking up a list of B games. I was buying some games for my Xbox, and saw that this game was getting great reviews from people. At the time it was only 25$ so I got it along with some others and waited a little while to play it. I can easily say this is one of my favorite games of all time. I am normally against stealth games, but this game is so different.This game is my ""Half-life"". I eagerly await a sequel in any form. I could describe why this game is good, but I doubt I could do it justice. I will say that it has thrilling story, fun and non-limited game play as well as a new type of art design. Without taking the extreme graphic engine approach, Arcane made a game that looks vivid and nice all around. This game is a solid 10/10. Generally with a good game, at some point I would say something like ""I don't agree with this decision but its not a big deal"". However, with Dishonored I never found myself saying that. Even the DLC game of the year content that I only recently tried has been great! I completely recommend this game.			"

												Don't get me wrong, Dishonored IS a good game. The gameplay in it is fantastic, the setting is really cool and interesting, and the pure number of ways you can deal with just about any scenario is nothing short of awe-inspiring. However, it does have its claws, most of which settle around the story and how it frames its characters, but it's best to try to be ignorant of them if you want to get the most out of this game. Just play it and try not to get too invested in the story because the game won't really reward that investment. I'll list my issues below in a spoiler, but if you are even thinking about buying this game, grab it.  Characters as a whole never really feel like people, they come off as robotic cardboard cutouts most of the time, primarily because they don't seem to ever react to anything. This is something that if you notice it, it's hard to ignore if you are trying to get into the story. The city itself is interesting, it's just that the flatness of the characters never really makes it feel alive.  The other problem that I have with the game is how it calculates how your actions ""impact"" the rest of the story. Whether or not you get a good ending is mostly determined by how many people you have killed and how much general ""chaos"" you have created. However... I went through my playthrough taking mostly knock outs and only killing someone if I needed to silence them before they rang the other guards. Despite these tactics I was still getting high chaos ratings at the end of every mission because of the bodycount tha I was hitting. None of these bodies would ever be found, and most of the people who ever saw me are now dead, and yet still, everyone knows who I am, and the city is going to hell. I'm not dropping corpses to the rats, I'm not charging guards head on, and yet the game still treats me the same way simply because of this bodycount. It's actually frustrating, because the moments where you'll find yourself seen and then have to fight your way are the BEST part of the game. Summoning a rat swarm at the top of a tower, and accidently luring all the guards in the area up the steps, then throwing a grenade too kill every one of them because I'm cornered shouldn't make me a saint. At the same time however, that's just one section out of four in the level and even if I don't kill a single soul after this I'll still get high chaos because I happened to kill eight people out of necessity. It just feels like the emergent gameplay side of Dishonored conflicts with the morality system in a way that punishes the player on the story end of the game because they wanted to play Dishonored the ""fun"" way. Again, fantastic game and this is a gripe I have with it, but the more you refuse to care about the morality/chaos system, the more fun you'll have.			"

In fact this one of my favorite games of all time and i can't deny the amount of content here is outstanding. Good things:Incredible combat system most satisying sword fighting in a fps yet.Beautiful graphics.Great levels the layouts are perfect for a stealth focused game like this.Quite a big variety of weapons and magic at your disposal.Setting is nailed here.Soundtrack is nice here not amazing but good.Bad things:Could of been different swords to use apart from Corvo's folding blade which is cool defenataly but other swords would be great (i know you can choose between the assasins sword and the overwatch sword it would be nice to switch between them)Guards can say the same thing over and over sometimes but it shouldn't bother you much.The story here is a little weak but it's alrightThis game does have a few flaws here but the amount of content here is just awesome and worth your time and money It's hard to conclude but i love this game so much that it's going to have to be a.                                                                                10/10                                                                   A must own you gotta play this masterpiece.

												If Thief, Bioshock, Hitman, and Assassin's Creed had, in that order, a careful genetically spliced baby from all their genes they would get Dishonored. Far exceeded my expectations and what I thought the game would be, it is ****ing Fantastic!  9.2/10 at least.			"

												Vooshka! After raving about Bioshock Infinite (BS:I), I wasn't expecting to experience another game of that quality for quite some time.  But Dishonored is AMAZING and easily BS:Infinite's equal - and that's no small compliment!!!  Comparing the two is inevitable.  If I'd happened to have played Dishonered first, I'd still be comparing them but just doing it in my  BS:I review instead.Like BS:I, Dishonered has a very richly detailed world with tons of character and characters.  As great as the storytelling and ambiance is, what sets Dishonored apart for me is the variety and excellence of gameplay:You can see the influence of games like Bioshock (guard the little girl); Half Life (same lead artist - just look at the barricades and tall boys); Thief (the stealth elements) and Deux Ex (multiple ways/paths to achieve goals).  However, it's important to note that the game doesn't feel derivative at all.  It manages to riff off all the best elements but is still very much it's own game and not a knock-off.While stealth is encouraged, you have many ways to complete an objective including going in guns blazing. The synergy of your various powers work well together and really succeeds in making you feel very ninja-esque!Pacing is also excellent.  The story and and new abilities progress fast enough that things are constantly interesting but not so fast that you're overwhelmed or lost.This is another one of those 5 star games that I just didn't want to end and is easily on my MUST BUY list!  If you haven't played it yet go buy it... NOW!I'm off to jump into the DLC...			"

												Dishonored is pretty much a steampunk stealth assassin game. Yeah it sounds pretty cool! And it IS! Pros:- Great Storyline- Fun Stealth- Choices! - Plot Twist (Spoiler) Cons: - Seemingly short storyline inmho- Nothing to do after you complete the game, except for starting a new one- Could've done more with the enemy assassins Dishonored is a game that implies dark ninja magic, with assassins and stealth. The product is glorious and very well done. I do like how they made the relationship between Corvo and Emily, it was very touching and heart-warming. Overall, this game is very good and if you like stealth games this is one you should get!			"

												I just finished my first playthrough, and I am about to do my second, but I thought I would take the time to review the game first. The game has wonderful story, level design, and ar and theme.I enjoy stealth games, but I usually lose interest in them eventually before I beat them, but in Dishonored the story kept me engaged and playing the game to the end, and now I'm about to do it a second time to see what effect my choices have on the story. I would go out of my looking for books and notes with as much determination as looking for runes and bone charms. Sometimes the choices you make come back in really interesting ways, but I won't give spoilers (sorry!). The resolution was fantastic, I've worked hard for my low chaos run and it payed off.The early tutorial levels keep saying Play Your Way and give a bunch of examples of how to beat the level, after the tutorial there are still many ways for you to win with high and low chaos and different impacts on the story. The levels are perfect to let you sneak through vents, climb over rooftops, hide under tables or peak around corners (probably unrealistic but super helpful for not getting detected), or just run through everyone with your sword and gun. There is also a lot of variety in the levels.I am in love with steampunk. I wore goggles to school a couple of times. My friend told me it was cringe-worthy, but a bunch of people I don't even know gave me compliments, which was nice, so, maybe go out and by goggles for yourself? get steampunk a bit more mainstream? I'm getting off topic. The point is: I love steampunk and this game has fabulous whalepunk, which is basically the same thing, but more creative and original. I love all the art. The whalepunk street lights and Victorian sort of clothing, how dark it is (I mean gloomy, not hard to see), everything is great, especially the faces. Everyone is all caricatured and looks really unique. The textures are super neat also. They seem pretty realistic, but also sort of painterly. Like a really realistic oil painting.To summarize: the developers of this game deserve much more money than what they are charging, but the game is pretty old by now so it's cheaper. Lucky you.			"

												You can play this game two very different ways, or something inbetween, and each feels different. You can go a stealth approach and look for alternative pathways, and you can even go for a non-lethal solution in every mission. Or you can use all your powers and weaponry and have a good old slaughter. What is really interesting is how the game is affected by your actions. Murder without restraint and you end up with a darker version of reality. Or keep it under wraps and keep things a little less chaotic.The graphics of this game are something unique, in an art style that suits the somewhat Steampunk dystopian world. The level design is done well, plenty of nooks to explore but without getting lost. Alternative solutions to each mission make it replayable, and in two runs you can get all achievements if you so chose to. 'Hardcore' gamers will find joy in doing a non-lethal playthrough with no powers used, but there are also challenges for pushing certain skill combinations to the limit. And with the game being chopped into mission parts, which none the less flow into each other, you can easily sit down and play just a little bit. The downside? It's a short game. DLC is cheap enough however, and you do get a quality experience for it which isn't dragged out because a game should be X hours long.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. The gameplay is diverse; you can be a stealth player like its meant to be, or you can be a gun/sword person. But to top it all off, there are special abilities that make this game feel so fun and rewarding to play. The story is also very good and compelling right off the beginning opening, and the world is very immersive. It makes the player feel as if he is in the world. This is done by believable characters, and reading notes throughout the world. the combat in this game feels so smooth and flawless.

The stealth gameplay is a blast and with the blink teleport you feel like a badass, kinda like how the recent Batman games did that too.It is a beautiful gameplay mix of the Thief games, Deus ex and Bioshock combined with gorgeous locations and one of the best games this year.

												Do you like stealing everything not nailed down in Skyrim? Do you enjoy the sneaking around like a ninja like in Metal Gear Solid or Thief? Are you a fan of the unique atmosphere of Bioshock - with it's art deco and it's magic?You will LOVE Dishonored! It takes all the best parts of those games mentioned above, greases you up with some whale oil and shadow magic, and sends you out as a steampunk assassin! The game is similar to Bioshock and Deus Ex where you're given a task, and you have multiple ways of accomplishing it. Do you sneak through the shadows? Do you take over a rat and run through the vents? Maybe you rather leave bodies placed in sexual positions for guards to find.Either way, Dishonored is fantastic! I'm excited to get the DLC to continue more Dishonored.			"

												Dishonored is a great game, one of my favourite games actually. It's a stealth game that perfectly balances gameplay and story. The game gives you full control on how you handle your missions and provides you with more then enough equipment to do so. When you learn about the enviroment and about your abilities you can experiment in number of different ways. You can get through the whole game without killing anyone or you can play crazy and kill anyone you see. There are multiple different endings you can get. It all depends on how you play the game. The world is very believable but also fictional. It perfectly lets the story unfold itself in it. DLC's are also great and will keep you hooked even more time. I realy recommend this game. It's not just a game, it's an experience.-Lori			"

												An excellent stealth game. Plenty of strategy and patience involved when choosing how to progress though levels, and moving past small armies of enemies undetected feels very rewarding. Abilities are useful and varied, though it is possible to go through entire playthroughs only using a handful. The environment is extremely well done and levels are large enough to spend significant time exploring.My only complaint is that the campaign is fairly short, and additional playthroughs can be completed in a few hours. They are a great few hours though, and thoroughly recommended for lethal/non-lethal/undetected playthroughs. The most fun I've ever had pretending to fang around in a mask. Highly recommended.			"

												Grades: Longevity: 8/10 Story: 9/10 Gameplay: 8.5 / 10 Graphics: 9/10 Sound: 9/10 The main story of Dishonored portrays the journey of Corvo Attano, protector of the Empress. This is murdered by other assassins in front of Corvo and his daughter Emily, at the behest of Lord Regent, which is a corrupt and unscrupulous governor. Emily in the aftermath of these events is kidnapped by the assassins, and Raven then has to go save her and kill the Lord Regent, and other strategic targets, so Dunwall can return to normalcy. DLC in The Knife of Dunwall, we follow the demand of Daud, the assassin who killed the Empress, in search of Delilah, the name that was pointed out by The Outsider. The DLC in Brigmore Witches, continue to demand Daud, in search of Delilah. Starting with longevity, this editon took me 23 hours to complete, main story + DLC's, so longevity is not a strong point, but for the type of game it is, and how it's done, is an acceptable longevity . The story is the strongest point of the game, I enjoyed the story has moments that make us think hard in our decisions that affect its development, and has plenty of moral issues with parallels to real life. The gameplay is also one of the strengths of the game, has many similarities to Bioshock, where we have a weapon or power in his left hand and a sword in his right hand. We have two approaches to the game, the stealth approach or more ""careless"" approach and kill everything in front. The game also offers several ways to reach the destination, either through hidden tunnels, passes through the tops of buildings or even at street level, yet even possessar rats and get in on the ground pipelines. The combat is also well done and sometimes presents some challenge. The game's graphics are very good also, much of the gender of Bioshock, the characters very well made ​​and animated, and has very beautiful and sometimes breathtaking landscapes. The sound is also very good, although the very guards repeat their lines, gender, we always hear the same song whistled, or the guards with the same voice muttering. In short: Positives: - Gameplay - History - Characters - Landscapes - Combat - Powers Minuses: - Repetition of lines of guards FINAL GRADE: 8.7 / 10			"

												This game. Man. This game. Right, so Arkane Studios had me at hello. Every game they had something to do with development in; I loved. Dark Messiah: Might & Magic was the first game I ever played by them, and man. I PLAYED THE MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT OF THAT GAME. Then Bioshock 2, CoD: WaW (level design).  This review might be slightly biased due to my love for both Bethesda and Arkane Studios; so heed my warning. I am also not judging the DLC that had been released for Dishonored, for I haven't even touched it. Right, so after 85 hours, I can rightfully say that I practically know most of the game, inside and out. Played it on the hardest difficulty without killing anyone and without being spotted once through the entire playthrough. So a brief rundown on what Dishonored is. It's a stealth based action game, based in a steampunk Victorian Britain. It's very much a ""choose your own path"" game. You can run through it without killing a single being, or without being noticed by anyone; or you can get spotted by every one and decapitate them to your heart's content. Most of the level design also allows you to play through a map multiple  times, finding lots of ways to clear them. The game is very story intensive. But the beauty of it is; if you don't wish to explore the lore and story of every inch of the game's setting... Then don't. There are hundreds of books in the game. I literally mean hundreds. Which tell you the story of Dunwall and the isles that surround it. And you can choose to read none of them. It's hard to say what's wrong with the game, for I can't think of much... The AI is pretty good, along with the stealth. It's one of the games which make me happy because the fact you're in the shadow, doesn't make you completely invisible; it just makes you less visible. The sword-play is simple and fun to use. The powers are great too. However, I note that it's quite irritating when you want to play a complete passive game; and it forces you to equip your sword at all times. I would prefer to wield two powers in each hand, rather than have my sword constantly there; even if I weren't to use it.  Overall; I believe the game has a beautiful art-style and setting; great game-play, and it often makes you feel ♥♥♥♥ing awesome after you've successfully done something. Like if you choke-out a guard, get spotted; toss the knocked-out guard into the one that spotted you; making him stumble to the floor before you jump ontop of him and slice his neck open. There are probably loads of negatives I've missed out, but like I said. Biased. If anything, it would be replayablity. There are things there to make second play-throughs fresh; but really, after you've both killed everyone, then let everyone live; there's not much to explore unless you go hardcore. I would probably r8 it 8/8 m8. "

												Single-player assassination game with a unique twist. A story that is well executed and that changes depending of the style of play you'll have throughout the game, lethal or non-lethal. You're choosing your skills freely and you can tailor them to fit your own playstyle. Slide through shadows, sneak past guard and get your way in, or go head-on with your blade and slash your way, or combine the two. All at your hands.Improvisation and adaptation is the key. Dishonored is a vicious, raw, and incredibly good stealth-action game.""Feed him to the hungry rats for dinner. Early in the morning.""			"

												Honestly, one of the best stealth games I've played.Unlike some stealth games (Like Hitman Absolution) which requires you to do very specific things to get through things, Dishonored lets you go about things your own way. You can take out your enemies one by one, you can simply time your movements correctly to sneak around the guards, you can use one of the many different routes to get through or simply jump in the middle and fight all of the enemies using your weapons or the abilities you get.The way you go through things effect the world and the ending of the game. Killing a lot of people will cause high chaos, causing people heavily infected with the rat plague, known as weepers, to spawn more and the more people you kill, the more weepers there will be. Doing the oppisite will cause less weepers to spawn. Doing these things doesn't only effect how many weepers will spawn though, it also effects what your allies think of you. Killing less people will make people like you. Killing a lot of people will make them hate you, people in the city will become more violent and the city watch will start to crumble.I don't want to spoil anything because it is something you should experience on your own.GetThisGameRightNow/10			"

												I waited the release of this game from the first time I heard about it in 2012.And to be honest, I downloaded this game from torrent at first, then I liked it so much that I've bought it on steam as well, just to support the company.It incorporated good combat elements that kind of reminded me of Arkham Asylum if it was in first person and had a better timing element. The stealth is tactical, and various. There is never one way to do an assassination. If you like gameplay choice, steampunk, detailed games, or parkour (with magic) you should definently give this one a try.Truly a masterpiece and one the most beautiful and complex worlds in video game industry.

												After all the media hype for this game I wasn't expecting much after the Diablo 3 stinker.   But boy, does this game deliver!The art style is one of the best I have seen in a game, even surpassing the beautiful Guild wars 2 art direction. The stealth gameplay is a blast and with the blink teleport you feel like a badass, kinda like how the recent Batman games did that too.It is a beautiful gameplay mix of the Thief games, Deus ex and Bioshock combined with gorgeous locations and one of the best games this year.

												The world of Dishonored is fantastic; it is so rich and well-established by way of in-game books, notes, overheard dialogue and even just little scenes upon which you can stumble. Some people call Corvo, the protagonist, boring and characterless, but what's facinating is the effect that your actions  - and by extension, Corvo - has on those around him.People treat you differently by way of subtle changes in speech or tone and the lasting effect on one particular character is nothing short of brilliant.As far as gameplay goes, Dishonored isn't perfect. The stealth mechanics are pretty close to perfect, with leaning around corners, clearly visible alert warnings and a multitude of clever ways to get around without being seen, but it falls apart a bit in the combat. Corvo is heralded as a master of arms, able to 'beat three men at once', as a guard can be heard saying. Ironically, fighting more than one person at a time can be infuriatingly difficult. And that's on moderate settings.Because almost all NPCs use a combination of sword and pistol, you can cross swords only to be shot at point blank range by someone you can't stop, they can kick you; an unblockable attack that deals as much damage as a bullet, or they can just swing their sword as you jump backwards out of range and hit you anyway. Their sword range is about three times the length of their sword and you must block every single hit.The killy death tools are nicely varied, allowing for very stylish kills with grenades, crossbow bolts and shrapnel mines, and that's not even touching on the supernatural powers. Adding them, the game becomes a flowing action of combat adding a clever third dimension to swordplay (at least the way I fight). Aside from just jumping and teleporting high, time manipulation, rat control and blasts of wind are just some of the tricks you can use.Admittedly, you'll probably find one or two powers that you use more than the others, but the options are there to experiment.While the story can be a bit predictable, it serves as a good framing device to take you across the breadth of Dunwall, killing and stalking people of all kinds. Also all of the cutscenes are skippable for those who want to try speedruns.The DLC is an interesting topic, allowing a new perspective on the story as well as some different powers and amazing sprawling levels.The downside of these slow, stealth-based games is they can be lacking in F**k Yeah moments, but Dishonored makes up for that in lasting enjoyment, replayability and a world that you can be lost in for days.

												Do you like stealing everything not nailed down in Skyrim? Do you enjoy the sneaking around like a ninja like in Metal Gear Solid or Thief? Are you a fan of the unique atmosphere of Bioshock - with it's art deco and it's magic?You will LOVE Dishonored! It takes all the best parts of those games mentioned above, greases you up with some whale oil and shadow magic, and sends you out as a steampunk assassin! The game is similar to Bioshock and Deus Ex where you're given a task, and you have multiple ways of accomplishing it. Do you sneak through the shadows? Do you take over a rat and run through the vents? Maybe you rather leave bodies placed in sexual positions for guards to find.Either way, Dishonored is fantastic! I'm excited to get the DLC to continue more Dishonored.			"

												This game...i have mixed feeling towards it. On one side I loved the graphics, the style and voice actors and the music. I also loved the level design and overall the great freedom it was given to the player.....BUT this freedom was taken back due to the STUPID Chaos system present in the game. Which chaos you get influence the endings, problem is that chaos level is not affected by how stealthy you play but how many people you kill. I did a lethal stealth gameplay (never discovered/killed all the guards) and got the bad ending. Basically the story forced my gameplay, if you want a good ending you should not kill anyone which is bad. Non-lethal gamplay is boring and made a lot of powers and gadgets useless and restrict your options. This thing really ruined the game for me.However if we put this thing apart you get a solid game, with good levels and lots of fun. DLCs are a must have in this game. If what I mentioned earlier is not a problem then go for it, it's really a satisfying game to play. Personally I enjoyed Daud story more over Corvo's so I highly recommend all DLCs (except the trials of Dunwall that are useless).			"

												***WIP review***If you are a fan of the original Thief trilogy, you MUST play Dishonored.  This is about as good as a modern day Thief experience as it gets.  6.1 hours in and I'm loving every second of it!  I'm still very early in the game, and I already know I'll be replaying this title for a dozen times, if anything, to simply experient different ways to blast / sneak / ghost my way through.(so far I've been proceeding with the non-lethal way, ie choking + hiding bodies, but my next playthrough will be done with knives, and the next next run will consist of tossing whale oil tanks at the foot of some City Watch boys HAHAHA)Pros:- Immersive atomsphere!- Great story, weaven by characters that you actually care about, enriched with fascinating lores.- Open level design, with myriad of solutions to dispatch / get around enemies.- Most fluid movement / parkour system I've seen in a FPS (Mirror's Edge is garbage in comparison).- Skill and items that actually enhance gameplay and enpower the player.- Glitch-free audio and video, like the way a true PC game should be.Cons:- Occasional crashes, though thankfull they do not corrupt saving files.- Could use higher resolution textures (though I get the water painting-esque style is probably intentional) "

Although I'm not a stealth player usually so that this held my interest long enough to complete may be a testament to the game. on the other hand it may speak to a weakness for the truely stealth interested.

												This game completely exceeded my expectations. When I first saw the trailer gameplay, I quickly dismissed it as a Bioshock rip-off (actually in some ways it is, like being able to use superhuman powers like summon rats to kill enemies or even manipulate time and the overall creepy tone of the game with the Weeper xombie-like enemies that reminded me of the deranged Splicers from the Bioshock games) but the overall gameplay is a lot more fun than Bioshock 1 or 2 (I haven't played Infinite yet). The reason is because it allows for so many different options to either bypass or eliminate enemies. For example the Blink teleportation power allows for quick teleporting over short distances that can be used to access difficult areas or instantly appear behind enemies and dispatch them. There are many hiding places as well for stealth playthroughs, such as hiding underneath tables and fireplaces to avoid contact with enemies. Speaking of stealth, the game actually encourages you to not kill people other than your targets by the increase of rats and Weepers in each level depending on how many people you have killed. The story is serviceable but a bit generic, as it basically involves a government bodyguard who is framed for the murder of his Empress by his own comrades and must exact revenge on his adversaries with the obligatory plot twists added for good measure. The graphics are pretty good (I only ran it on medium-high and I only encountered minor buffering problems), but I didn't really like the cartoon-like visual style of the game because it looked kind of weird.

 Take a journey to Dunwall, Bethesda's version of liberal south California. You play as Corvo, a completely reasonable man who believes in equality among genders. You return home to your girlfriend, the empress of Dunwall, and everything seems perfect. Nope. A large mass of hippies have just discovered that you not only identifiy with the gender you were born with, but you have been r@ping every woman in a 100 mile radius over 300,000 times a day. In order to extract their revenge, they murder the empress you allegedly r@ped and kidnap her daughter to frame you. You are thrown in prison as people on the street express how glad they are you will be r@ped in prison.But Corvo's tale has just begun! Say hello to the resistance, a small band of like-minded individuals who believe r@pe is a-okay. While you don't agree with their views, you'd rather provide aid to the ones who will help you save the small child who's life you've probably ruined and/or ended.Gameplay is pretty fun.			"

												This fantastic game has been criminally overlooked.With a unique, beautiful art style and a believable, solidly-crafted world this game deserves attention, and the studio responsible deserve your money.The controls are perfect, there is genuine freedom in how you approach each mission, and this game actually delivers on the promise 'your actions will effect the game world', a claim made by many games but never really proven.

												Fantastic game. It is so hard to be ""good"" though, it's almost not fair. You are given so many wonderfull and satisfying ways to dispatch your enemies, only to be reminded that they are not always your enemies. If you didn't want me to kill the misled officers of the city watch, perhaps you should not have given me the ability to posses them into suicide. Or summon plagues of rats to devour them. Hrm? I'm looking at you Arkane Studios. The art style and setting highten the story, which may not be entirely original, but I couldn't find anything to complain about. You may be able to see the end coming from miles away, but it is still an enjoyable trip getting there. I was a bit concerned at the abrupt start to the game with no true backstory besides a paragraph of text. Then I discovered the story and history of the game world through exploration and knick knacks found throughout the game. If you are a speedy gamer who like to blast to the end, this may not be as enjoyable for you. On the otherhand if you enjoy skulking around, finding every piece of loot, note, and clue...  this is your game. Truly.			"

												One of my all time favourites... (dont be fooled by my playtime^^)the gameplay feels increadibly smooth especially with your teleport power and stealth assassination.There are in general 3 different ways to approach each mission.The most casual one would be to run in and openly murder every single guard you see in a big gun/crossbow/sword fight. That is also fun dont get me wrong but i prefer the predator style.Sneak in and get rid of the guards that are in your way. either by killing them quietly or buy putting the to sleep. The most difficult one is to sneak without any guard even noticing you but also without killing anyone. There even is an achievement when u finish the entire game without killing a single character or guard. Yes this is possible but extremely difficult.The story is ok. Nothing to big or something but the gameplay just puts this game at the top of things.Get it. You will enjoy it.			"

												A very fun game with some moral choices. You can go one of four ways: 1) Complete stealth; nobody ever detects you at all and you only knock people out.2) No kills; you may be seen but you never kill3) Some kills; you may be seen and you try not to kill, but when it needs to happen it does4) Rambo; you run into any fight and kill everyone.Depending on what you choose, the game has three different outcomes based off your ""chaos"" level. Higher and lower chaos will affect different things as well as change the last level.The swordfighting mechanics are great and you will never survive a fight using just the sword in a group of 3+. Using your magic powers via the Outsider's mark you can stop time, teleport around and generally have fun. Plot is simple but passable. Definitely a game worth multiple playthroughs, and each one may vary in time. A kill-everyone run takes only about 8 hours while a full stealth could take up to 30-40 hours. The DLC is very fun, in the Knife of Dunwall and the Brigmore Witches you get to play as an antagonist from the main game, the assassin Daud. The only other DLC currently is the Dunwall City Trials, which are very fun for everyone.			"

												Dishonored is the best game made by Arkane. It is able to balance well the action and stealth gameplay with a great level design. It is a game that allows you to play as you like without feeling to be railroaded or punished by adopting a certain play style or paths. Thus its replayability is high, even if the story feels like a fatality which you can't change much the outcome. However you can influence its morality, not by making the classical RPG two sided choices but by actually playing the game, each of your actions weights in the final result, which is quite an innovative game design standpoint that makes this game so special. On the pure artistic standpoint, it has a distinct personality that cast it apart from most productions. While a lot of the actual material and fluff of this game is purely optional, if you actually make a halt in your journey, read, watch and listen to all Dishonored has to offer you may discover it has a lot to say behind the actual game.

												I love this game so so much. I already completed it but at a high chaos which i wasnt happy with. I already started a 2nd playthrough and im on my way to getting the best ending with low chaos all the time. Usually i get bored after i played it once but this time i jumped straight back into it and wanted to try again. I totally recommend. Graphics are great, music very much reminds me of fallout (which i also love) I love the combat (or lack of) I love everythig about it. Oly things i dont like are Tallboys :( Evil i tell ya eeevviillll. Really want all the DLC so will have to get it when on sale. I bought this game for £2.50 i mean you just cant go wrong. Its wll worth the £9.99 so when its on sale its a must have. Buy Buy Buy 10/10			"

												Fans of DX:HR will find a lot to like in Dishonored. Though the setting and story are very different, it has many of the same awesome elements, like powers (some passive, some active), fantastic stealth and non-lethal gameplay options, and multiple ways to access areas / complete objectives. You can kill people, but if your death toll gets too high, things can get uncomfortable for you by way of more rats, more weepers and everyone thinking you are a complete jerk. The game monitors this with Chaos - minimal or no kills keeps you at low chaos. ""Chaos"" is an apt word, I think, because at higher chaos levels, having to deal with more hordes of vicious rats and rabid plague victims trying to kill you does make things a bit chaotic.The stealth is a bit different than DX:HR as there's no cover action. Cover is just whatever you are hiding behind. There is, however, a lean function. At first I wasn't keen on it and wanted to be able to ""lock on"" to cover items, but once I got used to it, I liked the fluidity of it.I recommend that you not try for achievements on the first playthrough. You'll unlock some of them along the way regardless, but going after Clean Hands or some of the others before you're familiar with the game (and all the ways you can accidentally kill people) is just going to be frustrating.Since I can't review DLC separately, I'll do that here, too. I haven't played The Dunwall Trials, but I just finished up the two story DLCs, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches. Together they make one story, and you play as a different (and very interesting) character from the main game. I thought that they were very well done, and felt like a rich addition to the game. Unlike many DLC, they didn't feel like ""more of the same"" - though the basics are the same, your DLC character has access to some different powers, items and upgrades. The story runs concurrent to the events of Dishonored, and I suggest playing the main game through completely before the DLC for the added richness provided by the combined perspectives.My only complaint is that the game menu design makes it take entirely too long to start up the game and navigate to where you load a DLC save.

												I didn't get around to playing this until a free weekend gave me the chance to test whether or not my PC could handle this game at all. When it turned out my PC could, and quite well at that, I found myself running around a quirky Steampunk Victorian England... place filled with gross rats and strange looking people. Most of whom wanted to attack me. And I got to respond to them sneaky-like or with a wide assortment of deadly weapons and abilities. It reminds me quite alot of Deus Ex: Human Revolution in its gameplay, except of course this game focuses more on the main storyline rather than having a bunch of side-quests to distract you. I mean, there are side-quests, but the ones I did actually led to giving me more options to complete the main story thing I was really there to do, which I found really cool. I've always had a thing about side-quests in games, especially when the plot is seemingly something of great time-sensitive urgency like finding your father before the post-apocalypse eats him alive (Fallout 3), hunting a renegade wizard with a seriously murderous revenge plan (Baldur's Gate II: Shadowns of Amn), or an extremely destructive dragon who likes to set stuff on fire (Skyrim), that all the side-questing I'd do when this major issue was going on just seemed... unnatural. My character has more important things to do than to hunt some fire-breathing ants, retake some girl's keep, or mess around with some thieves (Though at least Fallout 3 and Skyrim let you keep playing after the end, which would be the logical time to do all this other stuff). So to have Dishonored's side-quests be ""do this and i'll give you a tip about how to deal with your main objective"" just seemed kinda neat to me in that regard. Didn't feel like I was getting side-tracked, but was rather finding better ways to take care of my original business.Anyway, the gameplay is good and the story, while beatable in ~10-12 hours and having some plot points that were a bit too predictable, works fine as well. I was also surprised by the number of voice actors I recognized, and didn't know whether that was something I should be proud of for having such a good memory or embarassed of because it means I pay attention too much. The only real issue I have with the game is that the game is one gigantic moral choice from start to finish. Everything you do will end up affecting the ending... but only in the sense of ""good"" or bad"" (though there is a middle ending apparently, but no achievement for it). The end result being that you basically have to do two playthroughs where once you are a huggly saint who kills nobody, not even people who deserve it, and the other time where you leave so many corpses in your wake that you probably could use the bodies to walk across all the water you cross in a boat during this game.Bringing up DX:HR again, it had the same thing except it didn't affect the ending and only related to achievements, and therefore was not a moral choice system but rather just different options to solve the same problem, with minor rewards or penalties depending on your choices. And this is where Dishonored has a problem, because unlike DX:HR where both the Stealth and Combat style of play were fun and interesting, Dishonored is clearly geared towards more violent solutions. You only get two abilities that let you take people out non-lethally (an attack from behind and a ranged tranquilizer crossbow thing with pretty limited ammo). I mean you can use the other abilities to help too, like blink and the time stop to help bypass enemies, but that's really it.Or... you can shoot people with guns, slash them with swords, dive on people from the top of buildings, get a pack of ravenous plague rats to overwhelm your foes, mind-control someone to set themselves up for an unintended suicide, stop time and shoot a bunch of people in the head at once, Set traps for enemies to walk into and die horribly, take over turrets and other hostile devices to work against their former allies, and... yeah I think you understand where I'm going with this. There's alot more fun and interesting ways to make people die horribly in this game than there are to simply have them take a long nap. So play through the game once as the huggly saint for the achievements, then spend the rest of your time being a murderous psychopath bent on ending all life you come across.Anyway. I write too much as usual, so I think I shall wrap this up by answering the only question that matters: Is it fun? And yes, it is quite alot of fun. And with the ability to go back and replay specific missions to do things differently or just find more ways to mess about (a major source of appeal to me in Hitman: Blood Money), I can see myself playing this game quite alot more despite having beaten it now twice in only two days. And I still have the DLC's to do.So yes. Play it. Especially if you like Action-RPG things like Deus Ex or Bioshock. I'm glad I picked this up. :D			"

												About time I recommend this excellent game! Dishonored is a stealth based First person action game. The best part of the game is the choices, although the dialogues don't contain a lot of choices the gameplay does. You can play as I played my first play-through, spare everyone or just be a crazy killer using a lot of cool spells. Many see Dishonored as Assassin Creed in first person. Personally I say this game really reminds me of Thief, although Dishonored contains a lot more murdering. I also finished the ""Knife of Dunwall"" which let's you play as the Assassin Daud adding some more powers, gadgets and about three more missions. The story in Dishonored is pretty damn good as well. Although bear in mind this game does contain a few flaws mostly being bugs, the pros are still way more than the cons.Dishonored have a quite unique graphic style as well, set in a ""Steam punk, Victorian age""Final Verdict: A must buy, especially if you enjoyed the Thief franchise.

												One of the best signs that mean you've played a really good game, is that you get separation anxiety from its world—once you've finished it, you have an hard time starting another game because you were that immersed and engrossed by its lore, its characters and its ambience.Dishonored, for me, was one of these games.I've just finished the last DLC and I feel really bad in starting up something else.Please, Steam, I don't wanna do it. Just give me some more Daud and Corvo and Emily and Piero and Sokolov.But, alas, the backlog is calling and I have to soldier on and click on ""delete local content"" to save up some space on disk for newly-new games.

												I just realized that I never got around to recommending this, so I'll do it now. I'm not going to try to write a review, but I want to explain why I love this game so much.I love Dishonored because it puts me in a world filled with intricately linked systems and sets me free to experiment with them. Every item effects every other item in logical ways, producing a depth of interactivity that is incredibly deep, with combinations of systems coming naturally as you think about your environment as an actual world.I love that Dishonored doesn't try in vain to deliver photorealistic graphics, and instead utilizes a gorgeous visual style of watercolors and caricatures combined with surrealist lighting. Where so many other games struggle for life-like detail and end up slipping into the uncanny valley, Dishonored uses a non-realistic approach that is evocative and suggestive, making every character and locale a joy to look at.I love how Dishonored feels when I'm moving around. Every motion in the game is so beautifully smooth, from running to climbing, jumping to sliding. After playing Dishonored it's hard to go back to games where sprinting is limited and I can't jump up and grab a ledge to get over a wall. Mirror's Edge did running so well, and Dishonored surpasses it in every way.I love playing Dishonored because of all the options I've given when approaching a situation. There are countless ways through each area and multiple solutions to each objective, making stealth and combat equally viable playstyles.I could go on and on, but I'm going to cut this short. Simply put, it's a game that does nearly everything right. Every single aspect of the gameplay is masterfully crafted and polished to perfection. Buy this game. Buy it right now.			"

I'd recommend toggling at least the objective markers off so you can get lost in the levels and run into the extra content, just beelining to the targets with a GPS makes you miss most of the beautiful game world and level design, it's very much an exploration game.

												Don't get me wrong, Dishonored IS a good game. The gameplay in it is fantastic, the setting is really cool and interesting, and the pure number of ways you can deal with just about any scenario is nothing short of awe-inspiring. However, it does have its claws, most of which settle around the story and how it frames its characters, but it's best to try to be ignorant of them if you want to get the most out of this game. Just play it and try not to get too invested in the story because the game won't really reward that investment. I'll list my issues below in a spoiler, but if you are even thinking about buying this game, grab it.  Characters as a whole never really feel like people, they come off as robotic cardboard cutouts most of the time, primarily because they don't seem to ever react to anything. This is something that if you notice it, it's hard to ignore if you are trying to get into the story. The city itself is interesting, it's just that the flatness of the characters never really makes it feel alive.  The other problem that I have with the game is how it calculates how your actions ""impact"" the rest of the story. Whether or not you get a good ending is mostly determined by how many people you have killed and how much general ""chaos"" you have created. However... I went through my playthrough taking mostly knock outs and only killing someone if I needed to silence them before they rang the other guards. Despite these tactics I was still getting high chaos ratings at the end of every mission because of the bodycount tha I was hitting. None of these bodies would ever be found, and most of the people who ever saw me are now dead, and yet still, everyone knows who I am, and the city is going to hell. I'm not dropping corpses to the rats, I'm not charging guards head on, and yet the game still treats me the same way simply because of this bodycount. It's actually frustrating, because the moments where you'll find yourself seen and then have to fight your way are the BEST part of the game. Summoning a rat swarm at the top of a tower, and accidently luring all the guards in the area up the steps, then throwing a grenade too kill every one of them because I'm cornered shouldn't make me a saint. At the same time however, that's just one section out of four in the level and even if I don't kill a single soul after this I'll still get high chaos because I happened to kill eight people out of necessity. It just feels like the emergent gameplay side of Dishonored conflicts with the morality system in a way that punishes the player on the story end of the game because they wanted to play Dishonored the ""fun"" way. Again, fantastic game and this is a gripe I have with it, but the more you refuse to care about the morality/chaos system, the more fun you'll have.			"

												The best and only Thief reboot that really had any business existing.Okay, not really, but this game is amazing.  The story is a little generic and the characters don't have much to them, but the gameplay is intricate and satisfying, and the game gives you plenty of fun toys to play with that really let you get creative with how you murder people.Shame it rewards you for your creativity with a depressing ending, but whatever.  Small price to pay for being able to possess guards to literally walk in front of their own bullets.  Never gets old.			"

												Dishonored is a fantastic game (kudos to Arkane Studios) but this may be my favorite stealth-action game honestly because you are a supernatural assassin imagine it. Slitting throats and stabbing people in the abdoman with your right hand and being able to emit otherworldy magic with your left hand its like your black jesus or something. Also you have the Outsider who is describede as a mixture of God and the Devil who gives you these said magical powers but leaves it up to you, what you do with them. The story maintains its intrigue by showing how your actions impact the game world.			"

												Dishonored is pretty much a steampunk stealth assassin game. Yeah it sounds pretty cool! And it IS! Pros:- Great Storyline- Fun Stealth- Choices! - Plot Twist (Spoiler) Cons: - Seemingly short storyline inmho- Nothing to do after you complete the game, except for starting a new one- Could've done more with the enemy assassins Dishonored is a game that implies dark ninja magic, with assassins and stealth. The product is glorious and very well done. I do like how they made the relationship between Corvo and Emily, it was very touching and heart-warming. Overall, this game is very good and if you like stealth games this is one you should get!			"

												I had extremely high hopes for Dishonored, and whilst it can be quite fun, I feel a little bit let down.The style of the game is gorgeous, steampunk skylines and all that good stuff, very atmosphereic. I also like how you can complete the entire game without killing anyone.Pros:Messing around with the powers can be quite amusing.Terrific Atmosphere.Fun Acrobatics.Cons:The Story is...Pretty terrible, honestly. Incredibly predictable.You're very encuraged to kill instead of sneak, seeing as most upgrades are for that purpose, whilst only 1 or 2 are for stealth.I felt that I was far too powerful in the latter half of the game, it really took away from any tension.Overall, it's a fun little game on it's own. However compared to the Thief games on merits of stealth, this pales in comparison.			"

												This game is by far my favourite on Steam, and I would totally reccomend it to anybody who likes stealth games. This game is set apart from the rest by its astounding, immersive atmosphere. The soundtrack is beautiful, originally composed, and totally fits the theme. The level design is rather clever because it's very, very easy to get the objective and get out, but the replayability and challenge comes from collecting every last item and bit of money in the game. The controls feel extremely fluid and responsive, unlike other stealth games I've played which is a great bonus, and grounds for some of the parkour DLC gamemodes. Graphics are good considering the game's release, however the art style definitely redeems it a bit. Unlike the Hitman series, this game is very much playable going loud as well, because it is almost done in a Payday 2 sort of way. This doesn't compromise stealth at all though, as it was truly built for that I feel.This doesn't even mention the DLC, which, is definitely worth it as it ties up some loose ends and provides a lot more gameplay. The Dunwall trials are some fun challenge maps.			"

												This game completely exceeded my expectations. When I first saw the trailer gameplay, I quickly dismissed it as a Bioshock rip-off (actually in some ways it is, like being able to use superhuman powers like summon rats to kill enemies or even manipulate time and the overall creepy tone of the game with the Weeper xombie-like enemies that reminded me of the deranged Splicers from the Bioshock games) but the overall gameplay is a lot more fun than Bioshock 1 or 2 (I haven't played Infinite yet). The reason is because it allows for so many different options to either bypass or eliminate enemies. For example the Blink teleportation power allows for quick teleporting over short distances that can be used to access difficult areas or instantly appear behind enemies and dispatch them. There are many hiding places as well for stealth playthroughs, such as hiding underneath tables and fireplaces to avoid contact with enemies. Speaking of stealth, the game actually encourages you to not kill people other than your targets by the increase of rats and Weepers in each level depending on how many people you have killed. The story is serviceable but a bit generic, as it basically involves a government bodyguard who is framed for the murder of his Empress by his own comrades and must exact revenge on his adversaries with the obligatory plot twists added for good measure. The graphics are pretty good (I only ran it on medium-high and I only encountered minor buffering problems), but I didn't really like the cartoon-like visual style of the game because it looked kind of weird.

												Imprisoned, in a dark; dank cell, stripped of your pride and honour, the Empress who you guarded with your life killed under your very nose, and her daughter snatched away. These thoughts press on your mind as you sit in your cell, awaiting your unfair execution. Your attention is snapped back to reality when a tray of soggy looking food is slid under the cell door, only holding your attention momentarily, except for the small piece of paper with a scrawled note on it. You pull apart the bread to find the key to your cell door hidden in it. With freedom within your grasp, and redemption close behind it, what path will you take? Will you slaughter everyone in your path, and climb your way to your goal upon a pile of corpses? Or will you slip through the shadows undetected, leaving a trace no more than the entrance guard sleeping under a bush? The choice is yours.All in all, I really enjoyed this game, from start to finish. The story, though predictable, was both emotionally engrossing and enjoyable.The art style is gorgeous, the graphics breathtaking, and the effects mesmerising.The gameplay is smooth, tactile, and well thought out.The range of paths to a goal are almost overwhelming, whether you want to wipe a building clean, slip through undetected, or take every enemy out, one by one, like a ninja, noone aware of your presence.And finishing an objective can be acheived through various means too. Will you slaughter your target mercilessly, staring into his eyes as his consciousness slips away, will you sabotage something so his death appears accidental, or will you bribe the local gang leader to make them ""disappear""And your decisions have an effect on the outcome too. You can feel the distaste in the boatman's speech as he tells you of the screams he hears coming from the building you infiltrated, or his praise as he commends you on your wise course of action. Aditionally there are multiple end cutscenes, each a glimpse at the effect your endeavours have on society.I know this is a long review, but I really enjoyed this game, and I believe it's a must have, both for the stealth gamer, and the action epic alike.I can't recommend this game more.

												This game. Man. This game. Right, so Arkane Studios had me at hello. Every game they had something to do with development in; I loved. Dark Messiah: Might & Magic was the first game I ever played by them, and man. I PLAYED THE MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT OF THAT GAME. Then Bioshock 2, CoD: WaW (level design).  This review might be slightly biased due to my love for both Bethesda and Arkane Studios; so heed my warning. I am also not judging the DLC that had been released for Dishonored, for I haven't even touched it. Right, so after 85 hours, I can rightfully say that I practically know most of the game, inside and out. Played it on the hardest difficulty without killing anyone and without being spotted once through the entire playthrough. So a brief rundown on what Dishonored is. It's a stealth based action game, based in a steampunk Victorian Britain. It's very much a ""choose your own path"" game. You can run through it without killing a single being, or without being noticed by anyone; or you can get spotted by every one and decapitate them to your heart's content. Most of the level design also allows you to play through a map multiple  times, finding lots of ways to clear them. The game is very story intensive. But the beauty of it is; if you don't wish to explore the lore and story of every inch of the game's setting... Then don't. There are hundreds of books in the game. I literally mean hundreds. Which tell you the story of Dunwall and the isles that surround it. And you can choose to read none of them. It's hard to say what's wrong with the game, for I can't think of much... The AI is pretty good, along with the stealth. It's one of the games which make me happy because the fact you're in the shadow, doesn't make you completely invisible; it just makes you less visible. The sword-play is simple and fun to use. The powers are great too. However, I note that it's quite irritating when you want to play a complete passive game; and it forces you to equip your sword at all times. I would prefer to wield two powers in each hand, rather than have my sword constantly there; even if I weren't to use it.  Overall; I believe the game has a beautiful art-style and setting; great game-play, and it often makes you feel ♥♥♥♥ing awesome after you've successfully done something. Like if you choke-out a guard, get spotted; toss the knocked-out guard into the one that spotted you; making him stumble to the floor before you jump ontop of him and slice his neck open. There are probably loads of negatives I've missed out, but like I said. Biased. If anything, it would be replayablity. There are things there to make second play-throughs fresh; but really, after you've both killed everyone, then let everyone live; there's not much to explore unless you go hardcore. I would probably r8 it 8/8 m8. "

												Fans of DX:HR will find a lot to like in Dishonored. Though the setting and story are very different, it has many of the same awesome elements, like powers (some passive, some active), fantastic stealth and non-lethal gameplay options, and multiple ways to access areas / complete objectives. You can kill people, but if your death toll gets too high, things can get uncomfortable for you by way of more rats, more weepers and everyone thinking you are a complete jerk. The game monitors this with Chaos - minimal or no kills keeps you at low chaos. ""Chaos"" is an apt word, I think, because at higher chaos levels, having to deal with more hordes of vicious rats and rabid plague victims trying to kill you does make things a bit chaotic.The stealth is a bit different than DX:HR as there's no cover action. Cover is just whatever you are hiding behind. There is, however, a lean function. At first I wasn't keen on it and wanted to be able to ""lock on"" to cover items, but once I got used to it, I liked the fluidity of it.I recommend that you not try for achievements on the first playthrough. You'll unlock some of them along the way regardless, but going after Clean Hands or some of the others before you're familiar with the game (and all the ways you can accidentally kill people) is just going to be frustrating.Since I can't review DLC separately, I'll do that here, too. I haven't played The Dunwall Trials, but I just finished up the two story DLCs, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches. Together they make one story, and you play as a different (and very interesting) character from the main game. I thought that they were very well done, and felt like a rich addition to the game. Unlike many DLC, they didn't feel like ""more of the same"" - though the basics are the same, your DLC character has access to some different powers, items and upgrades. The story runs concurrent to the events of Dishonored, and I suggest playing the main game through completely before the DLC for the added richness provided by the combined perspectives.My only complaint is that the game menu design makes it take entirely too long to start up the game and navigate to where you load a DLC save.

												Dishonored is the best game made by Arkane. It is able to balance well the action and stealth gameplay with a great level design. It is a game that allows you to play as you like without feeling to be railroaded or punished by adopting a certain play style or paths. Thus its replayability is high, even if the story feels like a fatality which you can't change much the outcome. However you can influence its morality, not by making the classical RPG two sided choices but by actually playing the game, each of your actions weights in the final result, which is quite an innovative game design standpoint that makes this game so special. On the pure artistic standpoint, it has a distinct personality that cast it apart from most productions. While a lot of the actual material and fluff of this game is purely optional, if you actually make a halt in your journey, read, watch and listen to all Dishonored has to offer you may discover it has a lot to say behind the actual game.

One of the reasons I love Dishonored, is that it lets you choose how you play the game, it truly brings the optional stealth genre to life.You can play the story line and just learn things about Corvo Attano, but alternativly you can read books to learn about the world, and the history of it and it's characters.Arkane did an amazing job creating a world that you could see yourself living in.

Pros:- Great Storyline- Fun Stealth- Choices! - Plot Twist (Spoiler) Cons: - Seemingly short storyline inmho- Nothing to do after you complete the game, except for starting a new one- Could've done more with the enemy assassins Dishonored is a game that implies dark ninja magic, with assassins and stealth. The product is glorious and very well done. I do like how they made the relationship between Corvo and Emily, it was very touching and heart-warming. Overall, this game is very good and if you like stealth games this is one you should get!			"

												Being an assassin never felt so sad. Corvo's silence is the home of coiled emotions that are merely tamed or kindled by the player's. And Dunwall: Dunwall is a place that feels so alive it could devour you; but so alive in its desolation and poision, how odd; and Dunwall's soul is ever by, but ever so elusive. Truly, in Dishonored, choosing mercy or revenge is of great consequence. Chaos is ours. Empress Emily's cruel melancholy or tender hope, echoing from our actions, will touch us; whatever joy or regret come, they be ours too. Aesthetically, the game is wonderful. Its world-design is vivid and immersive, eerie and beautiful at once; throughout, the textures are blurred so that the world appears to be painted in pastels: if we didn't know that this is in great measure due to low-res textures, we could say that the pastel-style is deliberate. The sounds, too: they wrap us with their nightmarish draperies.Now, the characters have very distinct looks: they are stylised to the point of being emblems of their heart's secrets; can we not tell, or at least surmise, from their countenances or their shapes what their marrows hide? And they are richly human, harlequin, these characters: if not our heart, then another heart may tell us of their wins and woes. And if no one else so truly, Emily, Empress Emily, does care about Corvo's compassion, or his dread touch. When we are let loose here in Dunwall, to play with its loving and its wicked inhabitants as we please, do we not ask ourselves if the chaos, grand or vanished, in our wake is our very soul's, and not Corvo's?

												Vooshka! After raving about Bioshock Infinite (BS:I), I wasn't expecting to experience another game of that quality for quite some time.  But Dishonored is AMAZING and easily BS:Infinite's equal - and that's no small compliment!!!  Comparing the two is inevitable.  If I'd happened to have played Dishonered first, I'd still be comparing them but just doing it in my  BS:I review instead.Like BS:I, Dishonered has a very richly detailed world with tons of character and characters.  As great as the storytelling and ambiance is, what sets Dishonored apart for me is the variety and excellence of gameplay:You can see the influence of games like Bioshock (guard the little girl); Half Life (same lead artist - just look at the barricades and tall boys); Thief (the stealth elements) and Deux Ex (multiple ways/paths to achieve goals).  However, it's important to note that the game doesn't feel derivative at all.  It manages to riff off all the best elements but is still very much it's own game and not a knock-off.While stealth is encouraged, you have many ways to complete an objective including going in guns blazing. The synergy of your various powers work well together and really succeeds in making you feel very ninja-esque!Pacing is also excellent.  The story and and new abilities progress fast enough that things are constantly interesting but not so fast that you're overwhelmed or lost.This is another one of those 5 star games that I just didn't want to end and is easily on my MUST BUY list!  If you haven't played it yet go buy it... NOW!I'm off to jump into the DLC...			"

												One of my all time favourites... (dont be fooled by my playtime^^)the gameplay feels increadibly smooth especially with your teleport power and stealth assassination.There are in general 3 different ways to approach each mission.The most casual one would be to run in and openly murder every single guard you see in a big gun/crossbow/sword fight. That is also fun dont get me wrong but i prefer the predator style.Sneak in and get rid of the guards that are in your way. either by killing them quietly or buy putting the to sleep. The most difficult one is to sneak without any guard even noticing you but also without killing anyone. There even is an achievement when u finish the entire game without killing a single character or guard. Yes this is possible but extremely difficult.The story is ok. Nothing to big or something but the gameplay just puts this game at the top of things.Get it. You will enjoy it.			"

												About time I recommend this excellent game! Dishonored is a stealth based First person action game. The best part of the game is the choices, although the dialogues don't contain a lot of choices the gameplay does. You can play as I played my first play-through, spare everyone or just be a crazy killer using a lot of cool spells. Many see Dishonored as Assassin Creed in first person. Personally I say this game really reminds me of Thief, although Dishonored contains a lot more murdering. I also finished the ""Knife of Dunwall"" which let's you play as the Assassin Daud adding some more powers, gadgets and about three more missions. The story in Dishonored is pretty damn good as well. Although bear in mind this game does contain a few flaws mostly being bugs, the pros are still way more than the cons.Dishonored have a quite unique graphic style as well, set in a ""Steam punk, Victorian age""Final Verdict: A must buy, especially if you enjoyed the Thief franchise.

												Dishonored is a game that I almost completely missed out on. The first time I ever heard dishonored was when I was looking up a list of B games. I was buying some games for my Xbox, and saw that this game was getting great reviews from people. At the time it was only 25$ so I got it along with some others and waited a little while to play it. I can easily say this is one of my favorite games of all time. I am normally against stealth games, but this game is so different.This game is my ""Half-life"". I eagerly await a sequel in any form. I could describe why this game is good, but I doubt I could do it justice. I will say that it has thrilling story, fun and non-limited game play as well as a new type of art design. Without taking the extreme graphic engine approach, Arcane made a game that looks vivid and nice all around. This game is a solid 10/10. Generally with a good game, at some point I would say something like ""I don't agree with this decision but its not a big deal"". However, with Dishonored I never found myself saying that. Even the DLC game of the year content that I only recently tried has been great! I completely recommend this game.			"

												One of the best signs that mean you've played a really good game, is that you get separation anxiety from its world—once you've finished it, you have an hard time starting another game because you were that immersed and engrossed by its lore, its characters and its ambience.Dishonored, for me, was one of these games.I've just finished the last DLC and I feel really bad in starting up something else.Please, Steam, I don't wanna do it. Just give me some more Daud and Corvo and Emily and Piero and Sokolov.But, alas, the backlog is calling and I have to soldier on and click on ""delete local content"" to save up some space on disk for newly-new games.

												I didn't get around to playing this until a free weekend gave me the chance to test whether or not my PC could handle this game at all. When it turned out my PC could, and quite well at that, I found myself running around a quirky Steampunk Victorian England... place filled with gross rats and strange looking people. Most of whom wanted to attack me. And I got to respond to them sneaky-like or with a wide assortment of deadly weapons and abilities. It reminds me quite alot of Deus Ex: Human Revolution in its gameplay, except of course this game focuses more on the main storyline rather than having a bunch of side-quests to distract you. I mean, there are side-quests, but the ones I did actually led to giving me more options to complete the main story thing I was really there to do, which I found really cool. I've always had a thing about side-quests in games, especially when the plot is seemingly something of great time-sensitive urgency like finding your father before the post-apocalypse eats him alive (Fallout 3), hunting a renegade wizard with a seriously murderous revenge plan (Baldur's Gate II: Shadowns of Amn), or an extremely destructive dragon who likes to set stuff on fire (Skyrim), that all the side-questing I'd do when this major issue was going on just seemed... unnatural. My character has more important things to do than to hunt some fire-breathing ants, retake some girl's keep, or mess around with some thieves (Though at least Fallout 3 and Skyrim let you keep playing after the end, which would be the logical time to do all this other stuff). So to have Dishonored's side-quests be ""do this and i'll give you a tip about how to deal with your main objective"" just seemed kinda neat to me in that regard. Didn't feel like I was getting side-tracked, but was rather finding better ways to take care of my original business.Anyway, the gameplay is good and the story, while beatable in ~10-12 hours and having some plot points that were a bit too predictable, works fine as well. I was also surprised by the number of voice actors I recognized, and didn't know whether that was something I should be proud of for having such a good memory or embarassed of because it means I pay attention too much. The only real issue I have with the game is that the game is one gigantic moral choice from start to finish. Everything you do will end up affecting the ending... but only in the sense of ""good"" or bad"" (though there is a middle ending apparently, but no achievement for it). The end result being that you basically have to do two playthroughs where once you are a huggly saint who kills nobody, not even people who deserve it, and the other time where you leave so many corpses in your wake that you probably could use the bodies to walk across all the water you cross in a boat during this game.Bringing up DX:HR again, it had the same thing except it didn't affect the ending and only related to achievements, and therefore was not a moral choice system but rather just different options to solve the same problem, with minor rewards or penalties depending on your choices. And this is where Dishonored has a problem, because unlike DX:HR where both the Stealth and Combat style of play were fun and interesting, Dishonored is clearly geared towards more violent solutions. You only get two abilities that let you take people out non-lethally (an attack from behind and a ranged tranquilizer crossbow thing with pretty limited ammo). I mean you can use the other abilities to help too, like blink and the time stop to help bypass enemies, but that's really it.Or... you can shoot people with guns, slash them with swords, dive on people from the top of buildings, get a pack of ravenous plague rats to overwhelm your foes, mind-control someone to set themselves up for an unintended suicide, stop time and shoot a bunch of people in the head at once, Set traps for enemies to walk into and die horribly, take over turrets and other hostile devices to work against their former allies, and... yeah I think you understand where I'm going with this. There's alot more fun and interesting ways to make people die horribly in this game than there are to simply have them take a long nap. So play through the game once as the huggly saint for the achievements, then spend the rest of your time being a murderous psychopath bent on ending all life you come across.Anyway. I write too much as usual, so I think I shall wrap this up by answering the only question that matters: Is it fun? And yes, it is quite alot of fun. And with the ability to go back and replay specific missions to do things differently or just find more ways to mess about (a major source of appeal to me in Hitman: Blood Money), I can see myself playing this game quite alot more despite having beaten it now twice in only two days. And I still have the DLC's to do.So yes. Play it. Especially if you like Action-RPG things like Deus Ex or Bioshock. I'm glad I picked this up. :D			"

												As a stealth game it's a bit too easy even on hardcore difficulty, but it shines in all other aspects. Fun, if overpowered and abusable combat mechanics, lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulator sandbox methods for taking out the enemies, Dark Messiah style. Brilliant style, audio, ambience, atmosphere, world. I'd recommend toggling at least the objective markers off so you can get lost in the levels and run into the extra content, just beelining to the targets with a GPS makes you miss most of the beautiful game world and level design, it's very much an exploration game. Also: Terri Brosius is one of the writers!			"

												Grades: Longevity: 8/10 Story: 9/10 Gameplay: 8.5 / 10 Graphics: 9/10 Sound: 9/10 The main story of Dishonored portrays the journey of Corvo Attano, protector of the Empress. This is murdered by other assassins in front of Corvo and his daughter Emily, at the behest of Lord Regent, which is a corrupt and unscrupulous governor. Emily in the aftermath of these events is kidnapped by the assassins, and Raven then has to go save her and kill the Lord Regent, and other strategic targets, so Dunwall can return to normalcy. DLC in The Knife of Dunwall, we follow the demand of Daud, the assassin who killed the Empress, in search of Delilah, the name that was pointed out by The Outsider. The DLC in Brigmore Witches, continue to demand Daud, in search of Delilah. Starting with longevity, this editon took me 23 hours to complete, main story + DLC's, so longevity is not a strong point, but for the type of game it is, and how it's done, is an acceptable longevity . The story is the strongest point of the game, I enjoyed the story has moments that make us think hard in our decisions that affect its development, and has plenty of moral issues with parallels to real life. The gameplay is also one of the strengths of the game, has many similarities to Bioshock, where we have a weapon or power in his left hand and a sword in his right hand. We have two approaches to the game, the stealth approach or more ""careless"" approach and kill everything in front. The game also offers several ways to reach the destination, either through hidden tunnels, passes through the tops of buildings or even at street level, yet even possessar rats and get in on the ground pipelines. The combat is also well done and sometimes presents some challenge. The game's graphics are very good also, much of the gender of Bioshock, the characters very well made ​​and animated, and has very beautiful and sometimes breathtaking landscapes. The sound is also very good, although the very guards repeat their lines, gender, we always hear the same song whistled, or the guards with the same voice muttering. In short: Positives: - Gameplay - History - Characters - Landscapes - Combat - Powers Minuses: - Repetition of lines of guards FINAL GRADE: 8.7 / 10			"

												I just finished my first playthrough, and I am about to do my second, but I thought I would take the time to review the game first. The game has wonderful story, level design, and ar and theme.I enjoy stealth games, but I usually lose interest in them eventually before I beat them, but in Dishonored the story kept me engaged and playing the game to the end, and now I'm about to do it a second time to see what effect my choices have on the story. I would go out of my looking for books and notes with as much determination as looking for runes and bone charms. Sometimes the choices you make come back in really interesting ways, but I won't give spoilers (sorry!). The resolution was fantastic, I've worked hard for my low chaos run and it payed off.The early tutorial levels keep saying Play Your Way and give a bunch of examples of how to beat the level, after the tutorial there are still many ways for you to win with high and low chaos and different impacts on the story. The levels are perfect to let you sneak through vents, climb over rooftops, hide under tables or peak around corners (probably unrealistic but super helpful for not getting detected), or just run through everyone with your sword and gun. There is also a lot of variety in the levels.I am in love with steampunk. I wore goggles to school a couple of times. My friend told me it was cringe-worthy, but a bunch of people I don't even know gave me compliments, which was nice, so, maybe go out and by goggles for yourself? get steampunk a bit more mainstream? I'm getting off topic. The point is: I love steampunk and this game has fabulous whalepunk, which is basically the same thing, but more creative and original. I love all the art. The whalepunk street lights and Victorian sort of clothing, how dark it is (I mean gloomy, not hard to see), everything is great, especially the faces. Everyone is all caricatured and looks really unique. The textures are super neat also. They seem pretty realistic, but also sort of painterly. Like a really realistic oil painting.To summarize: the developers of this game deserve much more money than what they are charging, but the game is pretty old by now so it's cheaper. Lucky you.			"

												You can play this game two very different ways, or something inbetween, and each feels different. You can go a stealth approach and look for alternative pathways, and you can even go for a non-lethal solution in every mission. Or you can use all your powers and weaponry and have a good old slaughter. What is really interesting is how the game is affected by your actions. Murder without restraint and you end up with a darker version of reality. Or keep it under wraps and keep things a little less chaotic.The graphics of this game are something unique, in an art style that suits the somewhat Steampunk dystopian world. The level design is done well, plenty of nooks to explore but without getting lost. Alternative solutions to each mission make it replayable, and in two runs you can get all achievements if you so chose to. 'Hardcore' gamers will find joy in doing a non-lethal playthrough with no powers used, but there are also challenges for pushing certain skill combinations to the limit. And with the game being chopped into mission parts, which none the less flow into each other, you can easily sit down and play just a little bit. The downside? It's a short game. DLC is cheap enough however, and you do get a quality experience for it which isn't dragged out because a game should be X hours long.			"

												I know many players who have finished this game say it's a little short. And after doing a complete non-lethal stealth run through myself in one afternoon I have to agree. However keep in mind that that is just one way to play Dishonored.Personally I feel that the game was designed so as to cater to all types of players, from those who prefer to sneak around and leave enemies unharmed to those who like to run around and dismember guards with your gadgets and blade. There are also optional quests that the player can partake in to receive runes to spend on abilities, with certain abilities further catering to specific playstyles.The big motivating factor for me was the fact that how you play may dictate how the climax and ending plays out. I played through twice, once as a good Corvo and the other as a bad, and both times I was satisfied by the different dialogue and overall ending. Moreover, for those achievement seekers I feel that the list of achievements for this game also promotes the player to play through more than once.One memorable chapter for me with this game was the masquerade party; I spent hours on this one level just exploring this beautifully designed area. It's like taking part in a piece of actual history, the likes of which you know does not happen anymore.Other than that, this game isn't very graphically intensive though still looks fairly good, and the combat itself is very fluid. I wish Skyrim had a similar combat system.			"

												This game. Man. This game. Right, so Arkane Studios had me at hello. Every game they had something to do with development in; I loved. Dark Messiah: Might & Magic was the first game I ever played by them, and man. I PLAYED THE MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT OF THAT GAME. Then Bioshock 2, CoD: WaW (level design).  This review might be slightly biased due to my love for both Bethesda and Arkane Studios; so heed my warning. I am also not judging the DLC that had been released for Dishonored, for I haven't even touched it. Right, so after 85 hours, I can rightfully say that I practically know most of the game, inside and out. Played it on the hardest difficulty without killing anyone and without being spotted once through the entire playthrough. So a brief rundown on what Dishonored is. It's a stealth based action game, based in a steampunk Victorian Britain. It's very much a ""choose your own path"" game. You can run through it without killing a single being, or without being noticed by anyone; or you can get spotted by every one and decapitate them to your heart's content. Most of the level design also allows you to play through a map multiple  times, finding lots of ways to clear them. The game is very story intensive. But the beauty of it is; if you don't wish to explore the lore and story of every inch of the game's setting... Then don't. There are hundreds of books in the game. I literally mean hundreds. Which tell you the story of Dunwall and the isles that surround it. And you can choose to read none of them. It's hard to say what's wrong with the game, for I can't think of much... The AI is pretty good, along with the stealth. It's one of the games which make me happy because the fact you're in the shadow, doesn't make you completely invisible; it just makes you less visible. The sword-play is simple and fun to use. The powers are great too. However, I note that it's quite irritating when you want to play a complete passive game; and it forces you to equip your sword at all times. I would prefer to wield two powers in each hand, rather than have my sword constantly there; even if I weren't to use it.  Overall; I believe the game has a beautiful art-style and setting; great game-play, and it often makes you feel ♥♥♥♥ing awesome after you've successfully done something. Like if you choke-out a guard, get spotted; toss the knocked-out guard into the one that spotted you; making him stumble to the floor before you jump ontop of him and slice his neck open. There are probably loads of negatives I've missed out, but like I said. Biased. If anything, it would be replayablity. There are things there to make second play-throughs fresh; but really, after you've both killed everyone, then let everyone live; there's not much to explore unless you go hardcore. I would probably r8 it 8/8 m8. "

												If you're into the whole stealth game with a challenge then I would definitely recommend Dishonored. But first, watch this http://youtu.be/4EoLKdCmSv8?list=PLdFqYxukiFnG7EvH5yFH8Is7CEBuTA1uL . Dishonored is pretty cool in a sense that I didn't know you could do so many things until you actually look them up. There's a whole plethora of weapons and ways to kill things and complete missions. Also, if you like challenges you could also limit yourself from using the weapons etc even.Though one thing I feel is a little awkward is that the good endings are a little pradoxical to the gameplay? If you don't kill anything or anyone, you will most probably get the good ending. It's tough and it means you don't get to use all those cool weapons etc. Which means you probably need another playthrough to get the ""full"" experience.I really like how the gameplay feels quite smooth and to me, the fun doesn't really die out as fast because really, there are so many different scenarios it'll probably take a while for you to finish them all. Some things that I do not like about the game though would be the damn unskippable cutscene during one of the final missions (I think it's the only unskippable cutscene) I also felt it was a waste in the DLCs because you can't really play as Daud any much more than that. I would have at least wanted to play as Daud in the Dunwall city trials but meh, the DLCs were worth it anyway. I still got tons of fun out of them, though I think people should proceed with caution when purchasing the DLCs because they are pretty short. Unless of course you don't mind. The DLCs are interesting though and offer new perspective when you playthrough the game again.All in all, buy the game when it's on offer or below $20 and you'll probably spend a good 11-30 hours on the game depending on how fast you speedrun and stuff. All the stuff written here should be taken with a grain of salt. Watch some videos about the gameplay before making your decision. :D Have fun			"

												For the most part I do not play games all the way through to completion without getting distracted by other games.  I played about half of Alan Wake, took a three month hiatus, then came back and finished it.  Not because the game was bad, but because there were other games I wanted to play more.  So the fact that I spent just under 30 hours sneaking all the way through Dishonored's story (during Steam's Summer Sale no less) is a testament to just how captivating this game is.I love the painted look of the graphics which proves, once again, that you do not need the latest technical wizardry to make a game pleasing to look at.  The story was good enough to keep my attention throughout  even if it did get a bit predictable.  I thought the writing was better than most games and the acting was quite good (with the exception of Piero, whoever voiced him was trying way too hard).What really drew me in and helped the game become one of my all-time favorites was the city of Dunwall itself.  It is the type of place that, if given enough attention and time, will become a character in and of itself.  I cannot emphasize enough that if you play the game, do not sprint through it just going from objective to objective and ignoring everything else.  Take your time, explore, feel the city out and learn its history, its customs, and its quirks.  If you do that the game will reward you for it.  Not in achievements, but in a deeper experience and more of a connection with what is happening around you.So to sum up, if Bioshock and Deus Ex had a baby and the child was raised by Half-Life 2 you would have the spitting image of Dishonored.  You need to buy this game right now.			"

												If you've watched the trailer and thought the game isn't as awesome as it looks, you're wrong. In fact this one of my favorite games of all time and i can't deny the amount of content here is outstanding. Good things:Incredible combat system most satisying sword fighting in a fps yet.Beautiful graphics.Great levels the layouts are perfect for a stealth focused game like this.Quite a big variety of weapons and magic at your disposal.Setting is nailed here.Soundtrack is nice here not amazing but good.Bad things:Could of been different swords to use apart from Corvo's folding blade which is cool defenataly but other swords would be great (i know you can choose between the assasins sword and the overwatch sword it would be nice to switch between them)Guards can say the same thing over and over sometimes but it shouldn't bother you much.The story here is a little weak but it's alrightThis game does have a few flaws here but the amount of content here is just awesome and worth your time and money It's hard to conclude but i love this game so much that it's going to have to be a.                                                                                10/10                                                                   A must own you gotta play this masterpiece.

												The Empress has been killed and you are the scapegoat, you have been betrayed by the spymaster and his constituants to take control of Dunwall. You are set to assasinate and extract high valued targets that put you into prison and fight to overthrow the new corrupt Lord Regent. Play how you want to play in this action-stealth filled game, do you want to be a ghost who sneaks in the shadows and prefers non-lethal or do you want to go in with explosive shot pistol rounds and fight your way to your targets. The game makes great use of both with the blink power which is one of the better ideas I've seen in gaming in a while allowing you to short-distance teleport to either sneak around or counter and flank. I will say the game starts off rather slow and your more inclined to choose full frontal assault until you get your powers and learn the game a bit, but once you start it becomes very fun exploring the various routes and paths around enemies and blockades on your way to your targets. One of the few downsides is the dialogue, there arn't many recorded lines for npc's as they say will you hear about cigars and whisky, the chances are very good. 8/10			"

												For me, this is tied with Far Cry 3 for GOTY 2012. It's such a unique and refreshing game. Very hard to stop playing. The world they created is amazing and has so much potential for many sequels. However, the story is very contained within this one game. Plenty of closure. It's a very intriguing story, too. I heard people calling the story weak, but it most certainly is not. You can play the game in a variety of ways. No killing, plenty of killing, balanced, whatever. There are quite a few ways to approach every part of every mission. There are some choices you can make in the game that does effect some dialogue and some more subtle things throughout the game, depending on what it is. It's got tons of replay value and plenty of secrets to find. You could play through it 3, 4, maybe even 5 times before you've seen everything that can happen in the game. Like I said, though, it's mostly subtle stuff, but I like that. It's not for everyone, but man, I applaud Arkane (a relatively untested studio until now) on their excellent work on this game. If you like BioShock, you'd probably love this game. But again, it really isn't just another rehash of other games. You might could say it takes some of the best gameplay elements from a number of games and combines them to create something special and unique. Really fun. It's also already got a little expansion to the game, and Bethesda is teasing more DLC to come. I sure hope there will be more!			"

												It's not often these days, unfortunately, that an entirely new, original series will start on a strong and striking note in the gaming mainstream. Many of the best games around today (in the mainstream), it is sad to admit, are reboots and reimagined sequels to established franchises. However, trust Bethesda to deliver a new and exciting addition to the scene with all the trimmings of any other big-budget competitor.This is a stunning game and it's enormous! And when I hear a game is enormous, I usually imagine an endless sand-box world to explore, which can sometimes not really be that good a thing. Dishonored resists this temptation and opts for a more linear sequence of smaller sandboxes, not disimilar to games like the later Splinter Cell entries. Dishonored of course is first person view, which works for it, but it's just as sneaky. Or you can go for straight up shoot-em-up action if you like. It's up to you.One of the best things about this game is you can be good at it. And when I say good I mean superhero good. Check YouTube user kekkoSoNicSyNdIcAtE for examples of this. I've never played a game that relies on talent and learning ones craft this much since Street Fighter II. The type of stuff you can pull off will amaze you doing it as much as a person watching it.The world you are thrown into is diseased, dank, Lovecraftian and dirty and it's so immersive that I could have sworn I came out of it with a layer of grime on me that I couldn't shake for days. The DLC campaigns are superb as well, markedly different to the main game and contribute interestingly to the story and experience as a whole. Most surprisingly as well, considering this game is made by Bethesda who are infamous for designing and writing great games that are hindered with silly little mistakes and flaws, I didn't encounter one singular bug.Worth every penny.

												This is an amazingly atmospheric game that supports a number of different play styles--you can be a sneaky pacifist, you can charge straight into combat, you can leave nothing in your wake but a trail of bodies (or dust)... you're set for choices. The storyline also changes subtly based on how you behave--not in an overt Mass Effect-y way, but more subtly. If you kill everyone you meet in your missions rather than sneaking by, people will begin to trust you less and be less friendly. It's a great game, and totally recommended.			"

												*English Version below. Keep in mind, that I'm not that good at speaking English, but I hope it's okay for you.*Klasse Spiel mit drei kleinen MängelnDishonored ist ein gelungener Mix aus Schleich-, Action- und Fantasyspiel. Die Steampunk-Atmosphäre wirkt gut und versetzt einen in die richtige Stimmung. Das Gameplay ist an-und-für-sich auch gut, doch hier gibt es die bereits angesprochenen Mängel:1. Das Spiel ist bis auf den höchsten Schwierigkeitsgrad (viel) zu leicht! Es gibt keine Herausforderung und somit geht einer großer Teil des eigentlich enorm tollen Spielspaßes verloren.2. Das Spiel ist u.a. deshalb zu leicht, weil das Zaubern zu mächtig ist. Vor allem mit dem Teleportzauber kann man sich ohne Probleme von a nach b bewegen, ohne überhaupt aufpassen zu müssen.Dies ist mittlerweile etwas abgeschwächt worden (weniger Reichweite, langsamere Bewegung, nicht mehr 100% lautlos), was es doch ertragbarer macht. Ich für meinen Teil habe das Spiel komplett ohne Blink (so heißt der Teleportzauber) durchgespielt, so war es schön fordernd.3. Das Nahkampfsystem ist je nach Spielweise und Art des Spielers entweder sehr gut oder sehr schlecht, in meinem Fall hat es mir überhaupt nicht gefallen. Das ist allerdings sehr spielerbezogen, ich kenne auch viele, die das Nahkampfsytem absolut lieben. Daher kann ich hier leider nur raten: Selbst ausprobieren!Dishonored ist ansonsten sehr gelungen, es spielt sich je nach Forgehen flott oder bedacht und langsam, actionlastig oder vorsichtig. Aber immer spielt es sich flüssig. Man kann auch je nach Entscheidungen das ganze Spiel durchspielen, ohne eine einzige Person zu töten! Diese besondere Herausforderung habe auch ich gemeistert, auch wenn sie extrem hart ist, da es so oft Stellen gibt, wo man beinahe stundenlang rätselt, wie man an den paar Wachen vorbei kommt, die man sonst beispielsweise einfach mit Slow-Motion erschiesst oder mit den Schwertern bearbeitet.Alles in allem ist Dishonored aber SEHR gelungen, und neben The Walking Dead hatte ich mit keinem 2012 erschienenen Titel so viel Spaß als wie mit Dishonored.**********Good game with 3 little shortcomingsDishonored is a good mixture blending of sneaky-, action- and fantasy-games. The steampunk-atmosphere is well done and it gets you into the right mood. The gameplay is good overall, but there are 3 shortcomings:1. The game is except for the highest diffiulty (way) to easy! There is no challenge and therefor it's not that much fun.2. There is expecially one reason that makes this game to easy: The kinda teleporting-spell ""Blink"" , which allows you to get from one place to another, is to mighty. You can't be seen doing this and you can blink yourself very far away from where you're currently standing, even without having to take the bad guys into account.The developers weakened this spell a bit (less range, you're a bit slower teleported and it's not a 100% silent anymore), what makes it a bit less superior. However, I'd still recommend everyone to try to play the game without using ""Blink"", just as I did it to keep it hard and challenging.3. The close-combat-system is - depending on your playstyle - either very good or very bad. For me, I didn't like it at all. But that really depends on the player, some of my friends like it very much. Sadly, the onliest piece of advice I can give you concerning the close-combat-system is: Try it yourself!Apart from that, Dishonored is very well done, depending on your playstyle it can be a very fast and full of action or slow and cautious. But no matter, how you play: It always feels smooth. You can even play through the entire game without killing any person at all! This was the hardest but also most fun challenge I set myself while playing through the game, and I did it. There are some really hard areas, where you have to think very long on how you do this, and that's what I liked the most.All in all, Dishonored is VERY well done and awesome, besides The Walking Dead there was no 2012-released title which was that fun to play from beginning to end.

												WOW.I'm at a loss for words. This game is simply brilliant. Everything is constructed in a way to make you fully immersed in this world. The story is the weakest element, but all the rest more than makes up for it. From the slick controls, jaw-dropping art style, gigantic levels, multiple meaningful choices and more. It achieves this while still being an amazing stealth game, with supernatural powers added for good measure. It's surely the best Deus Ex since Deus Ex, with DXHR in a close second.			"

												9/10An amazingly well-rounded game that makes you feel like an assassin while remaining a human being. Dishonored has managed to be a game with a seemingly overused theme, (being assassins and superpowers,) and still managed to craft it into a great game. Dishonored casts you as Corvo Attano, recently banished from your home by false accusations of murder. Now with you out of the picture, inner forces of Dunwall seek to break it apart from the inside. It is your job to uncover the true murderer... How far will you go to prove your innocence, and will you become a monster trying to? Dishonored has a unique and thrilling storyline, with a conjoined weapon and power system. Even just following a simple story mission can be nothing but good fun if you use the powers and tools given to you correctly. Dishonored is easily one of my favorite games, and you can count on it for hours of good fun and thrilling action.			"

												Dishonored is outstanding from my prespective! The only small con is that it can be short if you do not do side quests. Other than that the story is pretty good but, the real high point of the game is the gameplay. There are numerous ways to kill enemies and to sneak around. Also there are many choices like deciding to get revenge through killing or through different ways. If your looking for a game that is mainly about story that still maintains a good amount of action, this is the game for you. I finished the game in about 8 hours (doing most side quests on hard). I just started going through it again hoping to 100% it. So Dishonored is definently a buy if your into stealthy games like this. I give it a 10 out of 10.			"

												Recommend? Yes. Buy it, buy it whenever you can. full price is 100% worth it for this game.The atmosphere is amazing. Dunwall is a city fallen into plague and the city and its people rot together, while the rich sit on top of it all as if nothing ever happened. And the more you kill the worse it gets. For everyone.The gameplay is very fun and creative, whether you play high chaos kill everyone, chop em all up and feed em to the rats, or low chaos, full ghost, clean hands good guy, this game is fun. You get crazy powers, great climbing ability and pretty decent sword skills.The story is something that seems pretty empty if you just do the main objectives, but paying attention to details, dialogue, notes, and even both sides of the story (high and low chaos) give more depth to the story and the world.Because it gives you a lot of diversity in how to play, and has achivements that are fun to get, it has a lot of replay value as well.Absolutely love this everytime I play it; I did my first casual runthrough of it about two years ago and I'm still going through for achievements and just for fun.

												Actions speak louder than words in the city of Dunwall, a cesspool of crime, corruption, and plague. Corvo Attano, the hired bodyguard for the Empress, must use everything at his disposal to clear his name and rid the city of corruption and deceit.Dishonored has surprised me in many ways, from its unique watercolor art style to its brilliant combat system. Ultimately, the game is not what I had expected after seeing the first theatrical trailer featuring a man in a jail cell. That being said, I wasn’t a fan after the first twenty minutes of play. Eventually, I put it down and moved on to other things – after a few months, I came back to give it another try. That was when I realized what I had been missing.I’ll summarize my thoughts about this game in a simple pros/cons list, but I will elaborate on each item.PROS:>Unique Art Style<The brushed watercolor style that decorates a unique city called Dunwall may initially come across as outdated and technologically inferior to other games created during the same time period. Some players may view the style with that pessimistic attitude, and some may view it as a unique work of art. I chose the latter.>Interesting Story and Deep Lore<The story is a special experience, and your actions will matter – remember who you are and whom your actions affect. Read the books you find and drop eaves on conversations to discover the surprisingly deep backstory.>Excellent Voice Acting<You will certainly recognize whom you're talking to, because the voice acting is consistently stellar throughout the entire game.>Worthwhile DLC<Although they rarely see big sales, all three DLC packages are worth your time and money.>Best Assassin Experience<There is no better assassin experience in any game. I’ll explain this below in the sections on combat and stealth.>Brilliant Stealth<The game can be completed without ever being seen by an enemy – ever. It’s a tricky thing to master, but it is a very fun way to play the game. The player may also rush into battles with guns a’blazing and blades a’sparking.>Combat Is Incredible<The combat system is intricate, diversified, and very expertly crafted. There are many ways to go about clearing an area (it rewards those who enter a battle with a plan of action). This game is much, much more fun if you are creative – trust me.CONS:>Game Length<I would have loved to see more, but perhaps that’s why we buy DLC. Also, keep in mind that the length of the game depends on how you play. Fast and furious will make the game shorter, while slow and stealthy will make the game longer. Both are great fun.>NPC Animations<Corvo's actions look swift and fluid, but the actions of other NPCs seem a little repetitive, stiff, and awkward during conversations. This may take away from how much you care for characters.>Story Vagueness<Some elements of the story are a little vague, but this is minor. Plus, it is usually fixed by digging into the lore provided by books and conversations.I would place Dishonored somewhere among my top twenty favorite video games. It’s a worthwhile experience that is always fun to revisit. Do the right thing and buy this game, already.			"

												Dishonored is a game which has multiple endings due to how you as a player play throughout the game. If you are a person who is either in to killing enemies or stealthily past them this is a great game to try. If i had to give this game a rating out of 10 it would be a easy 9 out of 10.			"

												Actions speak louder than words in the city of Dunwall, a cesspool of crime, corruption, and plague. Corvo Attano, the hired bodyguard for the Empress, must use everything at his disposal to clear his name and rid the city of corruption and deceit.Dishonored has surprised me in many ways, from its unique watercolor art style to its brilliant combat system. Ultimately, the game is not what I had expected after seeing the first theatrical trailer featuring a man in a jail cell. That being said, I wasn’t a fan after the first twenty minutes of play. Eventually, I put it down and moved on to other things – after a few months, I came back to give it another try. That was when I realized what I had been missing.I’ll summarize my thoughts about this game in a simple pros/cons list, but I will elaborate on each item.PROS:>Unique Art Style<The brushed watercolor style that decorates a unique city called Dunwall may initially come across as outdated and technologically inferior to other games created during the same time period. Some players may view the style with that pessimistic attitude, and some may view it as a unique work of art. I chose the latter.>Interesting Story and Deep Lore<The story is a special experience, and your actions will matter – remember who you are and whom your actions affect. Read the books you find and drop eaves on conversations to discover the surprisingly deep backstory.>Excellent Voice Acting<You will certainly recognize whom you're talking to, because the voice acting is consistently stellar throughout the entire game.>Worthwhile DLC<Although they rarely see big sales, all three DLC packages are worth your time and money.>Best Assassin Experience<There is no better assassin experience in any game. I’ll explain this below in the sections on combat and stealth.>Brilliant Stealth<The game can be completed without ever being seen by an enemy – ever. It’s a tricky thing to master, but it is a very fun way to play the game. The player may also rush into battles with guns a’blazing and blades a’sparking.>Combat Is Incredible<The combat system is intricate, diversified, and very expertly crafted. There are many ways to go about clearing an area (it rewards those who enter a battle with a plan of action). This game is much, much more fun if you are creative – trust me.CONS:>Game Length<I would have loved to see more, but perhaps that’s why we buy DLC. Also, keep in mind that the length of the game depends on how you play. Fast and furious will make the game shorter, while slow and stealthy will make the game longer. Both are great fun.>NPC Animations<Corvo's actions look swift and fluid, but the actions of other NPCs seem a little repetitive, stiff, and awkward during conversations. This may take away from how much you care for characters.>Story Vagueness<Some elements of the story are a little vague, but this is minor. Plus, it is usually fixed by digging into the lore provided by books and conversations.I would place Dishonored somewhere among my top twenty favorite video games. It’s a worthwhile experience that is always fun to revisit. Do the right thing and buy this game, already.			"

												Dishonored is a wonderfully done stealth game developed by Bethesda the great minds behind the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This was my first stealth game I have ever played, The graphics are beautifl and stylized which I love. The game levels I loved a lot because you can approach them in many ways from poisoning your target to stabbing them in a display of blood and gore. I did not like the games ending though it was very disapointing I was expecting better. I would give this game a 8/10.			"

												Excellently crafted balance of stealth and action, with multiple choices for accomplishing every objective, for getting through every area, and even for the progression you want to choose.Only gripe (and this is a very minor one) is that if you are going the pure non-fatal (IE, no kills) route, you end up with far more Runes (the currency used to purchase and upgrade powers) than you need to buy the powers that you use. So, I suppose, more power options would be awesome....or at least the ability to upgrade the number of Sleep Bolts you can carry. :P			"

												Amazing game.It has everything i expect from a stealth-game, like big exploreable areas full of differen ways to get to your target, but never does this area feel empty its always full of detail, some collectibles (but not too much), and ennemyes that are based on how you play the game (going for the open offensive or trying to sneek through the place). All in all it's in my opinion one of the best singleplayer-stealth games there is at the moment.I rate 9.5/10The only negative point i can think of is the AI, because very rarely it just seems to ignore you. Oh and the guards do that classic ""Oh must have been the wind"" even when their decapitated mate lies in front of them, but i think that is often rather funny when it happens.Just to show you how much i liked the game: I wrote a review. I just finnished the game and thought to myself i gotta write a review! Thats how much i liked it :)Thank you for reading my review i hope it can help you!			"

On the other side the story is on the weaker side, it's serviceable but nothing too special, the music is basically non-existant (except from 2-3 tracks) and the animations could be better.The game is extremely well optimised by the way, it runs on the highest settings, 1680*1050 on my old pc(9600gt, i3).

												Dishonored is outstanding from my prespective! The only small con is that it can be short if you do not do side quests. Other than that the story is pretty good but, the real high point of the game is the gameplay. There are numerous ways to kill enemies and to sneak around. Also there are many choices like deciding to get revenge through killing or through different ways. If your looking for a game that is mainly about story that still maintains a good amount of action, this is the game for you. I finished the game in about 8 hours (doing most side quests on hard). I just started going through it again hoping to 100% it. So Dishonored is definently a buy if your into stealthy games like this. I give it a 10 out of 10.			"

												9/10An amazingly well-rounded game that makes you feel like an assassin while remaining a human being. Dishonored has managed to be a game with a seemingly overused theme, (being assassins and superpowers,) and still managed to craft it into a great game. Dishonored casts you as Corvo Attano, recently banished from your home by false accusations of murder. Now with you out of the picture, inner forces of Dunwall seek to break it apart from the inside. It is your job to uncover the true murderer... How far will you go to prove your innocence, and will you become a monster trying to? Dishonored has a unique and thrilling storyline, with a conjoined weapon and power system. Even just following a simple story mission can be nothing but good fun if you use the powers and tools given to you correctly. Dishonored is easily one of my favorite games, and you can count on it for hours of good fun and thrilling action.			"

												Dishonored is an interesting take on the stealth genre, though I think it has some major flaws. The game takes place in a plague-ravaged, post-industrial world where the main source of power is derived from refined whale oil, which has somewhat mystical properties it seems. However, despite the engineering marvels of the day, there are also supernatural forces at play that bestow the player character with magic abilities.For my very first time playing through the game, I chose the hardest difficulty available, turned off the 'cheaty' UI elements such as objective markers, and avoided using magic entirely (with the exception of the two or three places you absolutely must use Blink).These are some of the things the game gets right:- The atmosphere is quite unique- There are a great number of ways to go about navigating through the missions- You can choose non-lethal alternatives to completing objectives- Graphics are very decent- Smooth controls- The game provides options for disabling UI elements, such as floating objective markers and NPC awareness markers. These are some of my criticisms and observations:- First of all, the Game of the Year edition comes with pre-order packs that give the player a bunch of free upgrades and money after the first mission. ♥♥♥♥ that! Why do game publishers do this? Thankfully, it is possible to get rid of the free♥♥♥♥♥♥by disabling the pre-order packs in Steam settings, then starting a new game.- The plot of the story is extremely clichéd and predictable.- The game introduces quite a bit of mystery surrounding the supernatural agent that your character comes in contact with, however there doesn't seem to be a story resolution that explains its motives. As a result, it feels like a shallow way to write in game-mechanics rather than being about good storytelling.- While the missions themselves provide a lot of leeway as to how you go about completing them, the actual story progression is entirely linear. The choices the player makes ultimately have no impact the way the events of the story unfold.- Enemies repeat the same lines over and over, which gets old very quickly.- The characters you encounter throughout the game are fairly interesting, but your ways of interacting with them are extremely limited. They often feel like walking tape recorders set up to play their few lines of dialogue, rather than actual people.- The game pushes you toward dealing with threats through lethal means by giving you a substantial arsenal of deadly weapons. Actually using them generally throws the concept of stealth out the window though. - Very early on in the game, you get the Blink ability (teleport) as part of a tutorial and you can also choose to get Dark Vision (see through walls) immediately after. These abilities in particular make the gameplay utterly trivial. It is possible to use these an unlimited number of times and quickly speed through the game.Overall Dishonored is a game worth playing, but I don't recommend it highly.			"

												Excelente jogo de Stealth. Com uma história de vingança não muito criativa mas competente e gráficos bonitos, ainda que não magníficos, mas com um gameplay diferenciado dos clássicos do gênero (e muito bom por sinal), esse jogo garante um bom tempo de diversão, especialmente pra quem curte stealth mas está um tanto cansado do combate com armas à distância e a perspectiva em terceira pessoa. A ambientação do jogo também é digna de nota, com uma boa variedade de cenários bem contruídos, ainda que não muito extensos, em sua maioria. Os locais que você visita passam competentemente a sensação de abandono e desolação que a história quer passar. Há também uma influência de RPG perceptível no gameplay do jogo, com uma boa porção de side-quests e ocasionais escolhas que não influenciam muito nem no decorrer da história, nem em seu final.			"

												Enjoyed every second of this game.  The plot was intriguing and the artstyle creates a moving painting for you to see.  Leaping around on buildings and sneaking past enemies (or slashing their chests head on, if that's your thing) is incredibly satisfying.  Enemy AI is both smart yet easy to mess around with.  Rewire a wall of light and hit your sword against a concrete wall to get them distracted, causing them to investigate and burned to ashes by the shield you just rewired.  This game is in NO way linear.  There are always tons of ways to complete missions, whether it is the way you take out your targets or infiltrating a mansion.  You can actually go the entire game without killing a soul or being detected.  I need to start another playthrough just to do this, it's that good.  I honestly have no complaints about this game.

												Dishonored is a great game. It has a good plot (for a revenge plot), surrounded by a very interesting game world.I love stealth games in general, because they incourage you to hide from enemies and not make too much noise, unlike games as the CoD or Borderlands games. Not only you don't have to be stealthy in Dishonored, but when you ARE being stealthy it is a lot more rewarding. Have you tried just going around at least one level carelessly about wether someone sees you or not? It just feels so boring, especially with Corvo's choice of weapons and his powers.I really like how in every mission you don't have to actually assassinate your tragets, and instead you can neutralize them, wether you shoot them with a sleep dart or follow certain objectives than allow you to neutralize your targets in unique ways. (for example- exposing the Lord Regent's plans and sending him to prison by doing so)Another good thing about the game is the level design. Levels are designed in a way that you'll have multiple routes to take, and something about how levels are designed creates an atmosphere that really immerses you in the game.Overall, I think Dishonored is a fantastic game, and if you enjoy playing stealth games, this one is a must.

												This is one of the best games I've played! Very well planned out with a decent story and great gameplay. The Supernatural powers you have together with normal weapons and all that is what makes this game so special I feel. I loved every second of it, one of those games where you look up and 6 hours has passed already and you're still here playing. So many different ways of getting done what you came to do...Your choice if you wanna go silent through the whole game and not kill a single person with your own weapons/abilities, but in unconventional ways, or you can go HAM and kill everyone lol, your choice. That also gives it that replayability factor so you can play it through in a 'kill everyone and everything' style, and also try a stealth approach without ever being seen. There's even achievements for finishing the game without ever being spotted or killing anyone. Which I'm sure is a huge challenge, I might suck too much but I'm gonna try anyway! lolDefinitely worth it, I highly recommend it. Get yourself the Definitive Edition, so you have all the DLC's which makes for some more awesome Supernatural Assassination!10/10 would probably suck at being stealthy again!! (just F5'ing like a boss)			"

DISHONORED (THE BEST STEALTH GAME EVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEERRRR)so this game takes place in dunwall in a futristic like setting but is reminisant of the 17th century, you play as a dude called Corvo Attano who had just returned to meet his wife and kid when she is killed by ninja type dudes, and your daughter (the kid) is kidnapped, you are also framed for the murders suprisingly, you break out of prison and become an assassin who is driven by rage and has supernatural powers he uses to his advantage, not to forget his arsenal of weapons from a pistol to a van helsing like crossbow that you can fire just normal arrows or diffrent types to change your playstyle and way you hit things with the crossbow, you can also use rats to eat ppl, total savage stuff right there, you really need to buy this if you've not to see the powers and stuff this game contains, also installs very quick too and if your like me you will play this for hours to get dem achievements :P i wont spoil anymore, GET THIS AND EXPERIANCE IT FOR YOURSELF			"

												One of my top 5 games of all times. Great story, amazing atmosphere and environment and so many creative ways to approach the game, be a sneaky shadow or a murderous assassin just cutting through all your enemies, use cool powers or challenge yourself to play without powers..there are so many options. Plus awesome dlc adding tens of hours of extra gameplay...except Dunwall trials..we shall just not mention that >_> shh.			"

												I bought this on impulse when it released and it's been one of the most impressive stealth games I've ever seen. Great art direction and story telling, the voice acting was clearly on a tight budget but it doesn't detract from the overall experience of the game.Lots of fun to play and look at.Samuel is the best character and this games sequel ""Dishonored 2"" loses points because it doesn't have Samuel in it.10/10 love this game to death!

												Dishonored, an oldie but a goodie.First off, let's start with the pros -which there are a lot of- The Stealth: This game has stealth, and it does it GOOD. The suspense of listening and watching for guards walking past doors, tallboys roaming, making those dreadful noises. It's incredible. Sneaking up on a man standing on a balcony, teleporting up buildings. It's well done, no, fantastically done. The Design: Each level is designed with care, and passion, and TONS of effort. Arkane did a terrific job making sure each target was well placed, the levels weren't too long, too short. Everything is balanced, and it's great. There are so many side objectives, like runes, bone charms, side missions, and the like. It'll keep you coming back, doing so many different runs, just to grab every small little thing in the game. Through the game, you'll encounter excellently written characters, whether it be side characters, main protagonists, or even antagonists.  The Story:You are Corvo, Lord Protector of The Empress. After returning to the Empress with bad news, she is assassinated, and her heir to the throne, Emily, is kidnapped. You are framed, and as the title implies, are ""Dishonored."" After escaping prison and coming to the Loyalist Conspiracy, you are confronted by the Outsider in a dream, and are given magical powers to take revenge on those who helped wrong you. Incredible setup, and even better execution. Never once through this game did I ever stop to think about why or how this is happening, because the writers have intricately and delicately crafted an amazing story about a man seeking retribution for the loss of the Empress, and the heir to her throne, Emily. Now onto the cons. Game can bug:I haven't had this happen to me personally, but the game can bug. Like say, the screen going black, or a guard spazzing out when thrown down. Can be a bit boring: With all the unskippable cutscenes, I felt like I was watching a movie more than playing a game. But, that's mainly all I've got, hopefully this helps some people who are buying this game to prepare for Dishonored 2.			"

												Amazing game.It has everything i expect from a stealth-game, like big exploreable areas full of differen ways to get to your target, but never does this area feel empty its always full of detail, some collectibles (but not too much), and ennemyes that are based on how you play the game (going for the open offensive or trying to sneek through the place). All in all it's in my opinion one of the best singleplayer-stealth games there is at the moment.I rate 9.5/10The only negative point i can think of is the AI, because very rarely it just seems to ignore you. Oh and the guards do that classic ""Oh must have been the wind"" even when their decapitated mate lies in front of them, but i think that is often rather funny when it happens.Just to show you how much i liked the game: I wrote a review. I just finnished the game and thought to myself i gotta write a review! Thats how much i liked it :)Thank you for reading my review i hope it can help you!			"

												Dishonored is an AMAZING GAME. OUTSTANDING PLOT/ PLOT TWISTS, smooth fighting, great machanics.The area fits in with the mood, and there are hundreds of ways to beat the missions depending on what moves you get. What I think needs to be added (hopefully dishonored 2) is a co-op, different gameplay modes, Although i know that the develepors put SO MUCH work into not only making this game very detailed everywhere you turn, I feel that the game and dlc's are to short. I am hoping that In Dishonored 2 the game will be longer and just as amazing(I know it will be beause the developers have litterly spent years developing it). Also I knida didnt like the way they give you an arsenal of weapons and different things you can buy and the better outcome of they is to not use them at all. Also lets be realistic here, killing a few people isnt going to change the fate of Dunwall. Overall, this game is MY FAVRIOTE STEALTH GAME EVER. I really wish the games could go on forever(if they did, i would play EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM), I really commend the developers in the making of this game.			"

												Hooooly crap. This is a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good game. And I'll tell ya why.Story is amazing. You will actually care about stuff, whether it's th characters you meet or to the situations your faced with. The lore is super rich with interesting things never even mentioned in the game, so if you're into that, you won't feel left out. And it's easy to the story you want, I'll get back to that. The gameplay is also amazing. It's fluid, you'll always be able to do what you want with some creative thinking, and all powers have a point. (Only thing that kinda sucks are the bone charms. They are pretty lackluster compared to the rest of the game) the way the mechanics are crafted and blended lead to neither stealth or violent combat to feel incomplete, so either play style or a blend of both feels great. Oh yeah. If you love being not seen and spend more time surveying an area than a bored pedophile at a museum, you'll love this game. If you love violence and hurting people to a worrying, almost psychopathic degree, you'll love this game. And not only do you actions have full gameplay support, the story adapts well to what you do. It doesn't boast a fancy interchangeable story like its the only thing worth the game and blends nicely into the story. Only issue for you Michael Myers out there, the game will be considerably shorter if you murder kill everybody (unless you suck). But it's just as fun, and this game deserves at least another playthough anyway, so it's nothing game ruining. Because seeing someone devoured by rats while their friends and colleges watch is very satisfying if you resent the touch of another human. And for you moral objectors and social justice warriors, you can play the entire game with killing anyone, even the targets, instead using wit and some detective work to neutralize them if your conscience desires a more nonviolent way of making problems ""go away""Please, this game is worth your time. It's worth two times the price it is and you will love it			"

 This entire thing is going to be a spoiler because i'm too lazy to type this over and over again.OKAY! So dishonored is a stealth game where your choice matters. If you choose to kill everyone, you get high chaos.If you choose to spare everyone, you get low chaos. You also get the chance to get extremely high chaos in the high chaos route. And in a few of the DLCs you get the play as Daud, get improved blink (Time freezes when you blink as Daud) AND EVERYTHING IS FUN! Because you get a variety of assassinations, and you get the chance to ruin peoples lives so they suffer because of you. Oh, and when you brand Campbell, you see him near your weapons crate as an unconcious Weeper! It makes me feel bad for using the brand on him.You also get to jump off a bridge and live by using the drop assassination. Yaaaay!The game is just fun overall, i bought every single DLC and i thought it was worth it. Especially because you get to play Daud with different types of Mines, and also help the opposite side in the gang war. The Dead Eels. I hope you have a good time while playing this game. I'm still trying to beat it while looking like a pro but i can't aim, coordinate, or think.  By the way this game is fun to abuse powers in. Especially the windblast power. <3			"

												Dishonored is a great game. It has a good plot (for a revenge plot), surrounded by a very interesting game world.I love stealth games in general, because they incourage you to hide from enemies and not make too much noise, unlike games as the CoD or Borderlands games. Not only you don't have to be stealthy in Dishonored, but when you ARE being stealthy it is a lot more rewarding. Have you tried just going around at least one level carelessly about wether someone sees you or not? It just feels so boring, especially with Corvo's choice of weapons and his powers.I really like how in every mission you don't have to actually assassinate your tragets, and instead you can neutralize them, wether you shoot them with a sleep dart or follow certain objectives than allow you to neutralize your targets in unique ways. (for example- exposing the Lord Regent's plans and sending him to prison by doing so)Another good thing about the game is the level design. Levels are designed in a way that you'll have multiple routes to take, and something about how levels are designed creates an atmosphere that really immerses you in the game.Overall, I think Dishonored is a fantastic game, and if you enjoy playing stealth games, this one is a must.

												Short Story:  BUY THIS GAME (Game of the Year Edition)In my opinion there really aren't a great deal of quality stealth/assassin type games that exist. Of course there are the Assassin's Creed games (among others); however, Dishonored should definitely be considered among the top 5 (if not the best) stealth/assassin games of all time. The artstyle is great, the voice acting is pretty great as well, and the gameplay is superb. Every game has its flaws, but the only one I can think of for Dishonored is that they should have done more with the game.As of this moment I've put about 50 hours into the game and have played through the main game about 4 times. I have also played through the DLC about the same amount and I can say that I was never disappointed at any point through my time with the game. There were a few inconveniences (minor glitches that popped up a few times through my playthroughs) but overall I highly suggest you buy it. The DLC for the game is also pretty great, as it does a good job of expanding upon the main story for the characters (Daud is the man). The city trials might be the only one I would hesitate getting, as they are pretty stinking hard. Now that the price is super low, I would say there are no excuses for not getting this AMAZING game.			"

												A lot of options to do in this game...you can stealth choke everyone, kill everyone, or just ignore it and blink through everything. It's kinda like Deus Ex mechanics combined with the story of an assassin. Especially worth it for its current price of ten dollars...getting it on sale is even more of a plus. Can't wait for Dishonored 2!Enough practice and you can be like this guy:

												Dishonored, an oldie but a goodie.First off, let's start with the pros -which there are a lot of- The Stealth: This game has stealth, and it does it GOOD. The suspense of listening and watching for guards walking past doors, tallboys roaming, making those dreadful noises. It's incredible. Sneaking up on a man standing on a balcony, teleporting up buildings. It's well done, no, fantastically done. The Design: Each level is designed with care, and passion, and TONS of effort. Arkane did a terrific job making sure each target was well placed, the levels weren't too long, too short. Everything is balanced, and it's great. There are so many side objectives, like runes, bone charms, side missions, and the like. It'll keep you coming back, doing so many different runs, just to grab every small little thing in the game. Through the game, you'll encounter excellently written characters, whether it be side characters, main protagonists, or even antagonists.  The Story:You are Corvo, Lord Protector of The Empress. After returning to the Empress with bad news, she is assassinated, and her heir to the throne, Emily, is kidnapped. You are framed, and as the title implies, are ""Dishonored."" After escaping prison and coming to the Loyalist Conspiracy, you are confronted by the Outsider in a dream, and are given magical powers to take revenge on those who helped wrong you. Incredible setup, and even better execution. Never once through this game did I ever stop to think about why or how this is happening, because the writers have intricately and delicately crafted an amazing story about a man seeking retribution for the loss of the Empress, and the heir to her throne, Emily. Now onto the cons. Game can bug:I haven't had this happen to me personally, but the game can bug. Like say, the screen going black, or a guard spazzing out when thrown down. Can be a bit boring: With all the unskippable cutscenes, I felt like I was watching a movie more than playing a game. But, that's mainly all I've got, hopefully this helps some people who are buying this game to prepare for Dishonored 2.			"

												It's very easy to take the quality of a game like Dishonored for granted.Having just completed Dishonored on my first run (Very Hard, no kills, no alerts, old-school ghost run - I didn't even kill any rats!) I found it to be an immersive and very enjoyable game with plenty to distract you from your objectives whether it's a distant part of a map you want to challenge yourself to reach or just listen nearby to the hilarious converstions between the characters as they interact.The world of Dunwall is easy to lose yourself in, it's depth is complete and it's almost believeable that you are in fact the Empress' protector that the world's characters both fear and envy. The sheer quality of the game is massive, and it's surprising (until you think about the quality of Bethesda games in general) at the work put in to making every part of Dishonored unique and attractive, each level having areas non-essential to the core of the game, lending to exploration and inviting the curious to find alternative route.Every mission can be done in a myriad of ways ranging to the completely non-lethal to the chaotic anti-hero and most people will find themselves paused to listen or watch something unexpected or unannounced, often they can be missed if you leave an area too soon after an objective is completed or if you happen to find an alternate route.Each cut scene is meticulously crafted and will change depending on your actions through the game - not just the level.ALL of the voice acting is superb quality, though deliberately cheesy in parts - it fits the world it inhabits nicely.Dunwall is meant to be a slightly ridiculous and very ominous place. The scene and tone it sets is impossible to miss.I really enjoyed the difficulty on Very Hard, the characters have great vision and you really have to be careful to avoid their field of view, they're tough if they're alerted but Corvo is an agile and deadly foe.In fact despite how amazing the game is my only disappointment is the abilities Corvo has are limited to a single key, but it's easy to pick them using the keyboard numbers or the quick ability menu but I can only wonder how tedious it might be for those who either have to or choose a controller but it's a small price to pay I'll be honest and you won't notice it for long.Either way I'm disappointed I didn't pick this up sooner and since there are many endings and some additional, hightly-acclaimed DLC, I will certainly play through it again and I recommend people grab a copy, whether it's on sale or not.Dishonored is a must-have game in my book.

												Extremely good, but could have been so much more.Essentially all the core aspects of the game are excellent, much of the story is highly well written, and certain aspects reveal the potential to have been incredible.Unfortunately, it does not coalesce into a greater whole, largely because of a failure in binding the story together into a greater narrative.The Outsider is particularly egregious. Every appearance of the Outsider is, quite simply, a weakening of the entity. It undermines the horrifying and potentially corruptive nature of the being, personifying it to the point of meaninglessness.When compared to possibly the most ingenious piece of storytelling, the Heart, it is truly unfortunate. Still, an excellent game all around.			"

												Really good game... Played on demo.... Unsure of how to set the weapon wheel to the shortcut bar, but it was okay. Still very difficult to make me want to replay the game.PROS1. Interesting storyline with 3 different endings depending on the state of chaos. 2. The powers in the game are very interesting are you can use them in a variety of ways.3. Teleporting assasins, VERY COOLCONS1. A little drab. 2. Most powers are almost meant to point the game towards chaos e.g. rat swarm, shadow kill, blood thirsty, automatically biasing the game towards the ""bad"" ending.3. Story seems to be biased towards the bad ending unless you prefer having no powers. 4. I was hoping for some Wolfenstein type guards e.g. armored guards who can't be stealth killed, machine guns.Suggestions:1. More neutral powers or good powers. Alternative, segment the powers into chaotic or good.2. Co-op for a large map would be interesting.3. Most skills make for good pvp. Could consider multiplayer. Imagine a game full of super powered assasins.4. Allow for actions to affect the game early on to show their consequences e.g. do something that could save Wallace and Callista from meeting their end or not do anything/do something chaotic that will end up in their deaths. EDIT: It is possble to save them. You just need low chaos.			"

												One of my all time favourite stealth games. So if you're wondering I first played this game on the xbox 360 its why I haven't spent so many hours in this game. I love the concept of the game giving you alternative endings depending on how about you go the game, whether that be doing the first thing I did and mass murder everyone with my powers or take the game in a more stealthy route. As much as I love the game, I don't feel there is really much to do side mission wise. It would have been great if there was more to do than just to stick with the storyline, but other than that I enjoy the storyline and having different choices of endings depending on stealth.			"

												After two horrendous modern titles; one that was a ''cinematic experience'' and the other being a pretentious corridor shooter, this game restored my faith in modern gaming.A stealth based title with an emphasis on not getting caught by guards and sentrys; each level is a large map that presents you with a waypoint to get to and lets you have at it. You aren't given directions, rather the map has  multiple ways of reaching the waypoint and its up to you to decide how to get there. Each map also has a few optional objectives that are attained through exploration, at the beginning of the map, or through eavesdropping on discussions. The main missions themselves have options in the lethal and non-lethal varieties which affect the ending you receive. The maps are large in that there are many corridors and crevices you can reach. Many doorways to enter and go through; rather than a large field where you can see for miles, you get a tight, compact city with a lot of alleys and vertical movement. The developers succeeded in creating a city that feels as a city should; tight and winding with a lot of places to scatter about and travel through. The only downside is that stealth isn't so much an option as much as the better overall choice. Combat with the knife feels somewhat clunky and awkward, and the guns have incredibly low range. The crossbows are fine, but the guns themselves are horrible, which makes sense given the historical period, but trash is still trash. The books you find are also pretty mediocre. The manner in which they're written is meant to be from an informative perspective (not first-hand accounts as is the case with the Bioshock series), but some of the books you find are so long-winded that you start tuning it out. I'm sure that some of the books ar emeant to add to the game world, but something as mundane as whaling shouldn't have a three part short story associated with it. Then there's the literal fanfiction erotica in some of the books. Looks like the Bioware writers invaded the Dishonored offices for a short period.Lastly there's unanswered questions at the end. Mainly: The Outsider. It's like they wrote a key character with a pivotal role in your character's development then completely forgot him and forgot to mention just WHAT THE HELL IS HE. I mean, I know you have deadlines but come ON. The guy is just...completely done away with. Nothing else is said. WTF. Then there's the plague and what exactly caused it. We know it was ''brought'' over but there's a few things left unsaid.But those are just slight blemishes on an otherwise versatile and enjoyable experience. The game still holds up plot-wise as a game of political intrigue and backstabbings. Overall I'd strongly recommend it.			"

												one of the best stealth games i've ever played. this game has a good story and very good endings that's replayable. you can either storm in and kill everyone or try to be a pacifist. the one thing i like about this game is the chaos meter, the chaos meter is a meter that can change the game around and alter the ending because you either did mass killings(bad ending) or don't kill a lot(good ending). the more people you kill the more weepers there are(basically half zombies) going to be since the disease carried by rats will eat dead bodies thus creating more weepers in your playthrough in each level, making it a little hard if you're a stealthy silent killer. this isn't a linear game (not  comparible to hitman absolution) where you go to one path, in some levels, there are multiple paths you can take but you have to explore a little to find these paths.

												An action adventure video game set in a steampunk universe presented in a first-person perspective.You can kill how you want to kill. Be the assassin you want to be.Upgrade your supernatural abilities the way you want and kill unsuspecting people with unrelenting force.It is a truly rewarding and satisfying upgrading system.This studio previously developed the critically acclaimed Dark Messiah of Might & Magic with Ubisoft.If that is any indication, it should mean that this is a very well-developed product.They put a lot of time and love into it and it shows every step of the way.10/10 A grand experience, I highly recommend it to fans of the action-adventure ""stealth"" genre.

												Very rarely does a stealth game come around with such exquisitely built mechanics in every facet of it's production. Dishonored is one such game. It's a first person adventure that plays out however you want it to. While there is little story difference between the perfect stealth route and the massacre route through the game, the achievement hunting and high-scoring challenges will keep you coming back for playthrough after playthrough.

												Dishonored is a first-person stealth action-adventure game set in the fictional plague ridden city of Dunwall. You play as Corvo Attano, body guard to the Empress and friend to her young daughter Emily. Framed for murder, you are forced to become an assassin and spend the majority of the game seeking those who wronged you.Gameplay for a single campaign can last anywhere from 15 to 40 hours, depending on how you go about accomplishing your objectives.Because of the games steam punk inspired art style the graphics still look great, despite it being almost four years old. This game boasts a quality soundtrack, gameplay that can be tailored to a wide range of styles, good artistic direction and a compelling story, but my favorite aspect of Dishonored is what a big emphasis it puts on players choice. The game allows you to complete each mission in a variety of ways. The more you explore your environment the more options become available to you. Because of this, how you chose to reach and accomplish objectives impacts the environment and the way the story progresses. You can do ‘low chaos’ or ‘high chaos’ runs - deciding to use stealth, weapons, or magic to move forward. Creating panic and leaving dead bodies spreads disease, increasing the number of rats and weepers roaming Dunwall city streets. Operating under stealth and choosing to spare people usually takes takes more effort, but will make the ending to your story a happier one. Making different choices vastly alters your environment and how NPCs react to you in the game, giving it good replay value.The DLCs included in the GOTY addition are worth playing. They do a good job of continuing and complementing the story but are not necessary for it to feel complete, which is how downloadable content should be.			"

												First up, can I just say this has to be my favourite game ever... The story, the gameplay, the little details that go into this game is just immense. Everything you do has an outcome, you can have a really bad start of the game and then change your actions and vice versa. I would say one thing though, first time through play Ghost/Clean Hands.... makes for your second play through all that more exciting getting to stab things and tear things up.Want to play this game stealth but dark? Go for it, want to play this game stabby but be merciful on your enemy main targets? Go for it. Want to be a ghost but burtally assassinate everyone? Why the hell not!			"

												I used to play this on xBox, and I'm glad I purchased it again.Dishonored is probably one of my all time favourite games, it has great level design, a great story, great scenery, great characters and great gameplay.It's a very well optimized game - my PC is not the greatest, and yet I can run it smoothly on 60fps without as much as a stutter. The only negative thing about this game is that it's so short. If you play it stealthily, you will probably have more fun and it'll last you about 12 - 15 hours at best, wheras if you just hack and slash your way through the streets of Dunwall then it won't take very long at all to reach the end at about 5 - 7 hours. Super hyped for the sequel This game is a must to anyone who loves stealth.Would absolutely reccomend Optimized / 10  The boldest measures are the safest. "

												Vallaha ne yalan söyleyeyim, uzun zamandır hiç bu kadar zevkli ve tadı damağımda kalan bir oyun oynamamıştım. FPS - RPG ve stealth assassin birleşimi bir oyun nasıl harika olabilir dersiniz buna sadece Dishonored derim. Konusunu fantastik bir evrenden alan oyun kendi türünde rakiplerini açık ara farkla eziyor. Kelimelerle anlatılmaz fiyatı ne kadar olursa olsun alın oynayın. I didn't play any game like this for a long time. FPS - RPG - Stealth mixture how can it be great if you say I can only say this is ' Dishonored ' . It themes coming from fantastic universe but as realistic as real life. If you don't play this game before, don't think just buy whatever it's price.			"

And so until the end of time.No really, people who like games like System Shock, Thief, Deus Ex or Mirror's Edge should definitely try it.Grab it with the DLC, because they're as awesome and nicely made as the origina game is.Arkane made a starshooting surprise and a marvelous diamond in a sad industry, and this game is it. Best game I ever player since 10 years, no doubt.And believe it or not, but it has a lot to do and nothing to do with Thief.Just remind its arcade fast paced action and parkour/stealth in FPS style, not hard realistic infiltration.

												*Review Written on July 18th, 2013*Dishonored recently went on sale on Steam. So, of course, I purchased it and got a bit obsessed. I dropped path of the exile, which had been consuming most of my time, and started playing. I ripped through the first level or two attempting stealth, but mostly ending up killing people. By the third level, I decided to go with a non-violent route.Now, I’m going to stop right here and talk about how the general public has been treating Dishonored. Most people compare it to Assassin’s Creed, largely for two main reasons. Firstly, it released around the same time as the third Assassin’s Creed. Secondly, some of the gameplay has hints of Assassin’s Creed. This is a rather unfair comparision, however, and I’ll tell you why.The first thing that struck me while I was playing this game in a more stealthy method, is that you’re stuck in first person the whole time. To most people, this is meaningless, it simply makes it a “bad stealth game”. To those of us, however, that grew up playing Thief: The Dark Project, I instantly switched to Thief mode. Yes, first person view does make it harder to be stealthy. However, unlike Thief, you can lean around corners in Dishonored. Yes, shadows don’t make you invisible in Dishonored, but so what? They don’t make you invisible in real life, either. Shadows were a mainstay in Thief, but in Dishonored, they weren’t as vital.In Dishonored, you exchange shadows for ledges. In fact, the game is best played for stealth, if you’re good at thinking in 3d spaces. You cannot perform the parkour of Assassin’s Creed, but you’re not as clunky as in Thief. Thief relied on shadows, because you simply didn’t have the fluidity in the game to duck behind corners, or vault onto ledges. Dishonored simply requires you to think in a completely different way, and that throws a lot of people off.Now, you -can- play Dishonored as a hack and slash action RPGlite, if you want. However, you’ll unlock the bad ending that way, and you won’t get half of the achievements. If anything, the achievements, and ability to “Ghost” an entire level, is a callout to the Thief series.So I played my first playthrough of Dishonored, as I would have played Thief, and I had a FANTASTIC time playing the game. That said, I probably wouldn’t play the game a second time through as a non-violent stealther, but I might give it a go, one day, as a rabid, swashbuckling mass-murderer. You know, for the bad end and all that.If you were on the ledge about Dishonored, I can tell you this. Take the game without comparing it to other titles, and you’ll find a fairly fun, well-polished, and smooth game. Sure, there are the rare bugs, but in a gaming world where bugs are becoming more common place among shipped titles, they’re considerably rare. The game really only has three playthroughs in it for someone like me, who devours content and then moves on, but completionists might find a good two or three months of gameplay out of it. Considering the amount of time invested, compared to the money invested, any price tag under 20 dollars is a fair trade off these days.			"

												Yes this is a great game.Dynamic playthrough, great story and interesting challenges. Similar to Games like Splinter Cell, Thief, and somewhat Asasin Creed it is in the genre of a underdog shadow assasin saga.For overall quality, it does deserve praise over the whole and is reccomended to try.for Pros..The good thing is new folks can get into some heavy lifting as it teachs you step by step to become an ultimate stealth shadow. It can also inspire disinterested folks to get into this genre.cons..However the gameplay style ""can"" get repetitive as the game closes to the end. The players ""adjust"" and things can look quite simple as he/she gains experience.Since this is a non multiplayer and currently a closed dev. game I'd say go torrent if you are wanting to be frugal. But like I said above, it does deserve praise and worth the quality. Consider buying it if you want to respect the developers.			"

Lots of gameplay to be had, as well as DLC that puts you on the other side. Great DLC model on Blade and Witches, actual gameplay and content added. Would recommend only buying those after playing through the main game in full though. Game's a whole lot of fun regardless of how you play and is likely worth what ever it is priced at now.			"

												Dishonored is good though possibly a little over rated. Amazing art direction. Good gameplay, average graphics etc.  A solid 8 out of 10 is the best way I can describe my opinion of it.			"

												Very rarely does a stealth game come around with such exquisitely built mechanics in every facet of it's production. Dishonored is one such game. It's a first person adventure that plays out however you want it to. While there is little story difference between the perfect stealth route and the massacre route through the game, the achievement hunting and high-scoring challenges will keep you coming back for playthrough after playthrough.

												Challenging but fair, Dishonored is totally worth your money and time, i would even say that this is the best stealth game you will find these days. Your actions play a big part on the game's plot.You play as Corvo, Bodyguard of the empress, but she's killed and you get the blame for it. Will you kill the people responsible? Will you go out for revenge? Or will you spare them? This is up for you to decide. The only downside its the duration. 9.5 is my rating, i enjoyed my time with Dishonored immensely, and the game design and mechanics are so clever that you will love every single one of them.			"

												*Review Written on July 18th, 2013*Dishonored recently went on sale on Steam. So, of course, I purchased it and got a bit obsessed. I dropped path of the exile, which had been consuming most of my time, and started playing. I ripped through the first level or two attempting stealth, but mostly ending up killing people. By the third level, I decided to go with a non-violent route.Now, I’m going to stop right here and talk about how the general public has been treating Dishonored. Most people compare it to Assassin’s Creed, largely for two main reasons. Firstly, it released around the same time as the third Assassin’s Creed. Secondly, some of the gameplay has hints of Assassin’s Creed. This is a rather unfair comparision, however, and I’ll tell you why.The first thing that struck me while I was playing this game in a more stealthy method, is that you’re stuck in first person the whole time. To most people, this is meaningless, it simply makes it a “bad stealth game”. To those of us, however, that grew up playing Thief: The Dark Project, I instantly switched to Thief mode. Yes, first person view does make it harder to be stealthy. However, unlike Thief, you can lean around corners in Dishonored. Yes, shadows don’t make you invisible in Dishonored, but so what? They don’t make you invisible in real life, either. Shadows were a mainstay in Thief, but in Dishonored, they weren’t as vital.In Dishonored, you exchange shadows for ledges. In fact, the game is best played for stealth, if you’re good at thinking in 3d spaces. You cannot perform the parkour of Assassin’s Creed, but you’re not as clunky as in Thief. Thief relied on shadows, because you simply didn’t have the fluidity in the game to duck behind corners, or vault onto ledges. Dishonored simply requires you to think in a completely different way, and that throws a lot of people off.Now, you -can- play Dishonored as a hack and slash action RPGlite, if you want. However, you’ll unlock the bad ending that way, and you won’t get half of the achievements. If anything, the achievements, and ability to “Ghost” an entire level, is a callout to the Thief series.So I played my first playthrough of Dishonored, as I would have played Thief, and I had a FANTASTIC time playing the game. That said, I probably wouldn’t play the game a second time through as a non-violent stealther, but I might give it a go, one day, as a rabid, swashbuckling mass-murderer. You know, for the bad end and all that.If you were on the ledge about Dishonored, I can tell you this. Take the game without comparing it to other titles, and you’ll find a fairly fun, well-polished, and smooth game. Sure, there are the rare bugs, but in a gaming world where bugs are becoming more common place among shipped titles, they’re considerably rare. The game really only has three playthroughs in it for someone like me, who devours content and then moves on, but completionists might find a good two or three months of gameplay out of it. Considering the amount of time invested, compared to the money invested, any price tag under 20 dollars is a fair trade off these days.			"

												Yes this is a great game.Dynamic playthrough, great story and interesting challenges. Similar to Games like Splinter Cell, Thief, and somewhat Asasin Creed it is in the genre of a underdog shadow assasin saga.For overall quality, it does deserve praise over the whole and is reccomended to try.for Pros..The good thing is new folks can get into some heavy lifting as it teachs you step by step to become an ultimate stealth shadow. It can also inspire disinterested folks to get into this genre.cons..However the gameplay style ""can"" get repetitive as the game closes to the end. The players ""adjust"" and things can look quite simple as he/she gains experience.Since this is a non multiplayer and currently a closed dev. game I'd say go torrent if you are wanting to be frugal. But like I said above, it does deserve praise and worth the quality. Consider buying it if you want to respect the developers.			"

												Dishonored did something invigorating to the stealth genera, instead of focusing on slowly positioning yourself as required by patrols and line of sight, it allowed you to move quickly into opportunistic moments towards your goal.  You can still be sneaky and stay out of sight, but there is a conversation of ‘patience’ within the dishonored line, so that once you understand how you want to tackle some kind of  obstacle, you can just go for it.  Dishonored also intertwined among these mechanical empowering views on player agency, making the results of your actions in the earlier missions create systemic changes in future missions.  Hide and avoid combat and the last mission takes place in a military base with soldiers marching around in an orderly manner.  If you were a whirling dervish of murder and mayhem, then the last mission mirrors that chaos with incoming artillery fire and frantic soldiers.			"

												Ok let's make a generic category - point system for once.Gameplay: 8/10Both stealthy and rambo gameplay are possible, while perfect stealth + non-lethal or rambo w/o magic are the hardest and silent killer is the easiest. Being stealthy is much more fun though!There is character skilling but it doesn't go too deep, that's fine by me as the focus is really on the active gameplay.Controls are fluid, gameplay is diverse, multiple ways to succeed at your task.But the possibilities you have are all predefined by the dev's, there aren't any completely new ways you can discover.Graphics & Sound: 7/10The Artstyle is nice but there are textures which aren't really beautiful. The proportions of the characters look a bit weird, they have those huge hands and the characters don't really look unique.Sound is good, music is fine, too.Story & Atmosphere: 6/10You arrive somewhere don't know anything but you being the empress' bodyguard and BOOM she's dead. You don't know why you have to do things and unfortunately you don't really care, as you stay a character without personality just like everyone else. Could be worse though, you never feel like being completely useless and the story isn't crazy.The Atmosphere in the Game is awesome though! I really think I'm in 18th -19 th century England. They should have done more about the Steampunk part making the different between reality and this bigger, but that's personal preference. There are some books you find all over the places, not too bad, but you can't compare them to TES books.After all, is it fun? (There are good games which for some reason just don't entertain you)Yes. So let's give it 1 bonus point and finish with an 8/10.			"

												THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERSIf it were about how much fun I had, this game would easily be the 9/10 that a lot of 'critics' seem to have awarded it. I absolutely loved the world of Dishonored, the washed-out watercoloury art style slotted in perfectly with the nice blend of Steampunk/Old England. I loved the clothing designs (including Corvo's mask of course), and the weapons were really cool in my opinion as well. Blinking from rooftop to alleyway, dashing around guards and taking out targets was an amazingly fun experience for me in Dishonored.But despite all this I've said, looking at Dishonored from a critical standpoint reveals that it is honestly a mediocre game at best. An example of 'stealth done wrong', with basic elements like hiding bodies and using the environment to avoid combat encouraged only by the prospect of a 'good ending' and a couple achievements. The skill ""trees"" are what really make the game fall short. If you want to end the game not being treated like a blood thirsty merciless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then you must choose to avoid about 70% of basically ♥♥♥♥ing everything. A whole bunch of skills are virtually useless and some even unusable if you want to keep your chaos (the Good/Neutral/Evil system that is really more like Good/Evil/Satan-Incarnate) low. Lets not forget that using any weapons other than your crossbow, with sleep darts only of course, are strictly off limits as well (minus the choking ability that didn't even have a default keybind on the PC version). Yes, that includes that cool rewiring tool that you can use to make the turrets and electric gates only affect the bad guys. Oh, and to top it all off the game has a huge difficulty flaw in terms of being able to cheese through a whole bunch of the levels if you've maxed out blink and agility.The characters are pretty boring and one dimensional also, with clique traits following a clique storyline with *surprise* clique betrayals. The plot twists aren't even that much of a shock to player anyway, as we're barely given much of a chance to do anything with any of the characters we meet before we're shipped off to do another assassination. At least the non-lethal ways of taking out said targets are creative. The bad guys are all typical power hungry schemers or simply megalomaniacs, with the only one who has any bit of depth being Daud and possibly Havelock in the final scene. Corvo is a silent protagonist, not the kind that you can project yourself onto though however. Corvo has more than just a name, he has a backstory with possible love-related connections. You can't fit yourself entirely onto a canvas that's already half full, which has resulted in Convo simply being a really boring character where the only thing you have control over is if he decides to become a horrendous murderer and essentially doom everything by passing on his bad traits to the game's damsel: Princess Emily.Despite all I've just said, it'd probably be hard for you to believe that Dishonored is one of my favourite games. I just like playing it, despite its horrific flaws and awful characters/plot/mechanics I still find it enjoyable simply because this lame kinda genre appeals to me personally as the type of game I like jump into every now and again. I encourage you to play it for yourself before deciding on whether my judgements on the game are fair or not; I definitly recommend it for a quick playthrough if you're looking for something different yet not necessarily fresh.

												This game combines a good story with great gameplay. Nice for people who love having a lot of freedom in games and aren't restricted to playing a certain way. The game is almost a little too short in my opinion, though, understandable because of the huge amount of content you get rather than redundant filler quests or boring repetative missions. You can be stealthy or you can run in with guns blazing; each action you take has a different effect on the story and how the rest of the game pans out. I'd  play this game again.			"

												Pretty fun game, similar to Thief, and actually really in-depth and very atmospheric. Decent story and characters, plus a steampunk/victorian themed world, which is fairly unique for a game.At first I didn't rate this game that much, the starting section didn't really seem to grab my enthusiasm. But as soon as the game opened up and sent you to your first mission, the game became amazing, you can tackle the levels in a multitude of ways, and it sort resembles a crossover of Thief and Deus Ex in that respect. Once you get the powers, it gets much more fun too. There's also lots of different fun to use equipment, with melee or ranged combat, and lots of hidden and extra stuff to find.One thing is that game wasn't too great to play on my old rig, which was 3/4 years old, it's much more enjoyable to play on my new pc, so that might be something you should check on the spec requirements.I'd rate it 9/10 easily.

												Arkane studios did it again!Let me start off by saying that I loved The Dark Messiah which was also done by same studio. That game was greatly underrated. It had the RPG elements, stealth, great storyline, engaging narrative, great voice-acting, exploration, choice and a few of insane twists, orcs, demons, hot chicks, lust, the ability to kick, the ability to set off traps, alternate paths, dragons, mages, and a long single player campaign. I attempted to review that game on several occasions but failed every time. The game should just be played.This game follows The Dark Messiah in its footsteps. The melee fighting is nailed once again (unlike in Skyrim). Your melee blows feel real, you can almost feel the weight of your blows and the damage to the enemies is realistic. You don't have to hit someone over the head with a mace ten times for them to die (ahem...Skyrim...ahem...). Overall, we get tight controls, responsive and properly ported mouse, the ability to peek left or right, the ability to climb obstacles. The movement of the character has been nailed perfectly. You move fast when moving forward and you move slow when moving sideways. I should say that it wouldn't hurt for this game to have the kicking ability just like in the Dark Messiah. There are certain instances where you can push the unaware enemies from ledges.As far as the graphics go. Well, it's nice see a slightly cartoony-Rage-like rendition of the Unreal Engine 3.0, but seriously, why isn't this engine on life support yet? The textures are static, the trees do not move, the faces look like lifeless chunks of plastic. The water looks horrible but swimming under water looks and feels pretty realistic. The DX9 lighting is okaish. The artistic style however almost makes up for the old engine. I wish there were more graphic options to beef up the visuals. However, you can't see your legs and you cast no shadow. It's ironic that in some instances The Source Engine rendition in The Dark Messiah looks better than in this game (that's a 6 year difference).The gameplay is where the game shines (especially the melee). The melee fights are as satisfying as ever although they don't last as long as in the Dark Messiah. You get to wield a melee weapon and a range weapon. There are plenty of upgrades that you get at your home base, as long as you have the coins and the proper blueprints. The stealth has been pulled off pretty well, which is further expanded with the ability to hid bodies. Although there's no indication if you are hidden or not so you have to rely on your instincts. You have a choice of knocking out or slaying your unaware foes but if things go sour you can easily dispatch them with your weapons too. That happens to be one of the few gripes I have with the game, even though some enemies get tougher later in the game. You also get to teleport which I think makes the game easier in oh so many ways. You also get to collect magic runes and put them towards your character development, (higher jump, more health, the ability to see in the dark, etc.)I won't spoil the story much. You play as a mute imperial bodyguard/turned assassin, Corvo, bent on restoring the imperial throne and avenging the conspirators in a dystopian alternate reality world. I don't know why FPS developers are having such a difficulty with adding voice to the main character, it kills the immersion. Anyways, you get to put the pieces together, discover what the world has to offer and seek for clues for how the rat plague started. It's also interesting to meet various characters. Each one of them offers something a different view on reality and the nature of society. You get to do secondary quests and backtrack throughout the world. Overall, the pacing of the game feels real.There are moments when you don't have to fight enemies for a long time if you want the game to play life Thief. You also don't get to fight hordes of enemies although you are almost always in danger of being discovered. And even WHEN you are discovered you can quickly dispatch the enemies. I feel there should have been more danger and repercussions for being discovered. Although, if you play on hardest difficulty, it will only take a guard to slice you 3 times for you to die (maybe 5 with the health upgrade). You can also fight every enemy you see and clear the areas that way although you may run out of ammo quickly.Overall, this is a great game with many twists and epic moments although there is some slight imbalance as far as your super-powers go, otherwise, everything else has been nailed pretty well.

												Dishonored is fantastic.  It’s stealth mechanics are handled expertly and are balanced nicely with supernatural powers and fast-paced combat.  I’ve played the game through a few times and I enjoyed both stealth heavy and combat heavy playthroughs.  Additionally, the visual presentation, sound design, and music are all really well done and each made a good impression.Complementing the fun gameplay is some wonderful world building and storytelling.  Characters are believably flawed and nuanced, and I became invested in Corvo’s quest for revenge or redemption.  But stealing the show was the city of Dunwall.  Dunwall is a marvelous setting and I really liked the blend of steampunk, gothic, and Victorian elements.  I’d love to get to see more of this fascinating world that has been created and look forward to any further entries in the series.			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome you can play the good and bad side. However, in the DLC Dunwall City Trial, there are some ♥♥♥♥ing achievements that are hard to get for example you have to hit a guy's head from a very far distance without any odd of doing it right. You will put some tries on that. Also there are more annoying achievements that are really ♥♥♥♥in' annoyin' to get but once you get em you will get good.In a world torn asunder by a plague where no one seems good, no good soul seem to have survived you have to make a choice, to be the difference, trying to create a different world by being different from the others or to play by the world's rules where the chaos reigns. This game really has nice graphics you can make some tweaks to improve them further. The game isn't so long but it will provide you with a lot of fun. The DLCs are also awesome, excluding the Dunwall City Trials, which has some annoyances.If you like combat and stealth and some amazing background and story, this game is a great choice!			"

												Dishonored offers a simplistic, but dynamic approach to stealth. It's compact in terms of gameplay, and amazing in terms of aesthetics. The world has a lot of thought put into it and how much you uncover about it depends on how much effort you put into it. I'd go as far to say that some of the in-game ""cutscenes"" you encounter are a step up from what Half-Life 2: Episode 2 offered us.Also, Time Stop is easy mode.			"

												I can't believe I havent reviewed this masterpiece already but I cant see a more fitting time to do so than now, whilst I am installing the second game.  Dishonored is one of my favourite games of all time. I preordered it back in early 2013 and have completed it many many times since then. It combines a dark, interesting and immersive world with interesting characters and huge level of detail, to the extent that I have still been finding areas of the game and details that i have never seen before on my countless replays. One if my favourite things about Dishonored is the choices you make actually matter (unlike so many games) as they have impacts on the way certain missions are approached, the way people percieve you and of course the plot especially the end of the game.   Dishonored also has a huge amount of variability which leads to huge replayablity potential, this includes: a wide range of powers which allow you to approach a situation in different ways, challenges and achievements such as never be spotted or never kill anyone and the huge plot and level design variety such as having several routes to a key objective as well as several means to achieve the target such as aiding an ally so that they can dispose of the target for you, or a non lethal approch such as blackmail, or a stealth assassination or going loud and causing chaos with your powers and gadgets, the list goes on and on. The mechanics of the game are also really strong, stable and fun. I am a big fan of stealth games in general and i feel that Dishonored approaches stealth in the right way by offering many ways to accomplish it and rewards for doing so such as characters thanking you for sparing their relative who was a target (via a non lethal approach) and giving you runes, bonecharms or money for doing so. The combat is very fluid and stable and looks very cool with the combination of Corvo's powers and gadgets as well as finisher moves and other similar effects. The game has moments where you can pull off crazy kills and provides an opportunity for fun at any level of skill due to its numerous approaches to everything, meaning there is still fun to be had several playthroughs in by going for hard to pull off kills or attempting challenges such as not using any powers all game.*minor main game and DLC spoilers*The story of Dishonored is also very interesting and is multi-layered with lots of small details which really add to the whole game when found and explored including the motivations of characters and their backstory. With as few spoilers as possible the story of Dishonored involves Corvo Attano (you, the Empress' body guard) being framed for her murder which you witness. The game then sees you uncover the truth mission by mission as you tackle higher profile targets and various other tasks to clear your name and unveil the conspiracy behind you.  The game also establishes lots of really great memorable characters such as Emily (the soon to be Empress), Daud (the assassin), The Outsider and Samuel the boat man who takes you to and from missions. The game does a great job of showing the close relationship between Emily and Corvo which is a core part of the game and this is sure to be a core element of Dishonored 2. I also really liked 'The Knife of Dunwall' and 'The Brigmore Witches' DLC campaigns which take place parallel to the main story but see you playing as Daud, the Empress' real assassin who as well as Corvo has powers from the Outsider. The DLC saw Daud tackling a strong threat which at first may have seemed out of character for the way he was portrayed in the main game but as the DLC goes on Daud's motivations and reasons become more compelling. He and Corvo are both very deep and interesting characters, I particularly like Daud's understanding and insight of the Outsider compaired to Corvo. These DLC campaigns also offer the wide variety of many ways to complete them and a list of new powers and approaches and the campaigns are nearly as strong as the main story and are a great addition to the game overall. It is rare that game DLC is actually good and adds meaningful content but this is certainly and example of DLC done right. There is also a challenge map DLC which is personally not my cup of tea but I do understand the appeal of wanting to use abilities outside of missions and take on time trial challenge maps etc. Overall I would 100% recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of stealth games or story rich games with immersive worlds and plots. This is one of the best games i have ever played and I cannot wait to get started on #2 in a few hours. I've now finished the 2nd game and it is incredible too, a worthy sequel to a great game.			"

												Despite this game's best attempts, I enjoyed it.The story is poorly presented. An interesting world is painted, but the details are obtained through the optional mid-mission, flow breaking reading of found diaries and letters. Pass. The gameplay and missions are quite engaging... stopping to read a wall of text about someone's cousin coming to visit is counter-productive. Feeling obligated to stop and read the final enemy's diary mid-climax is maddening.With its score keeping system, Dishonored also attempts to steer you towards a strict non-lethal approach... granting intangible bonuses for not being seen or killing anyone. Which is a shame since it's at its best when you're able to use all the wonderful tools it gives you. When 9/10 of your options for getting through any given situation are lethal, feeling compelled to avoid them is cheating yourself out of gameplay. After a few levels, I decided to open up the playbook and feel free to kill when beneficial to the objective... and the game came alive. Dropping from a rooftop sword first onto a guard, shooting his friend, then countering and stabbing a 3rd before vanishing into the shadows is fun as hell. There is no non-lethal equivalent.Lest you think I'm just bloodthirsty....There's only one level, the Lady Boyle encounter, where the purely non-lethal approach is just as viable as the lethal ones... and it was my favorite segment. Everyone lived, though not everyone left happy :)Play naturally. Embrace ""high"" chaos. Dishonored is fun.			"

												Dishonored is one of those very rare few games that comes along and is very polarizing depending on how you play it. For instance, I went through on a completely non-lethal playthrough and found it to be a slow-paced, often difficult, yet immensely satisfying experience... then went on a lethal playthrough and found it to be a short, easy, wisp of a game. Suffice to say the stealth mechanics usually work well, and the game gives you many, many ways to complete various objectives, with lots of clever ways to dispatch foes... but just as it encourages using all these, it discourages combat altogether with the chaos system. Ultimately despite its faults (which are few), Dishonored is a unique, extremely enjoyable game that I whole-heartedly recommend to any fan of stealth-action games, or anyone who's looking for something outside the current norm of gaming.

												This game, created by Arkane Studios but published from Bethesda, has everything a fan of stealth, story, gameplay and RPG needs. The graphics are wonderfully stylised, with a selection of interesting characters that aren't too out of the ordinary, but not bland enough to make you forget them. The protagonist in particular, Corvo, is wonderfully created, so you can imagine what kind of man he would be and play him to that image, whether he's the forgiving kind of killer or whether he just wants to see Dunwall burn. The story-line is intriguing and there's plenty of different turns you don't expect that I've enjoyed so far. Plus I love the man eating rats. The game has levels of customisation whether you want to use a gun, crossbow or the supernatural powers you're given early in the game, with plenty of collectbles to find each mission and requires a level of intelligence to find, as getting to them are sometimes puzzling. So far I simply adore this game and if you're a fan of Assassin's Creed, Thief and Bethesda's works, I can't recommend this game enough.			"

Very good story, very good voice acting, very good level design, very good art direction, very good game.The story DLCs are very good, expanding the story and fleshing out the character of Daud.

This game is from a real life stand point of action&consequence. 10/10 Thanks to Candicebrill54 for the GOTY edition now to go do high chaos and finish up the achievements of the main game and start the DLC with Daud which I can't wait to do.

												My opinion about this game is a mixed bag. There are a lot of things that this game makes incredible well, and then there are some others that suck balls beyond EA levels.First of all, the price. The hell is this. I don't know if they changed it recently, but this game has stayed with a price tag of 60€ for a year or two after it's release. Is the game long? No. The game has multiplayer? No. Coop? No. Does it deserve the 60€'s?F#CK NO. Personally, my brother picked up this game in a sale for me as a gift, for 3€, and I think that's what is worth for a semi-dull single-player experience. Yes, I said dull. Here's why.The story, while it's quite interesting at first, there are points that get a bit boring, because it's usually the same thing over and over, even with some of those small maps re-used with little changes. And the story does have something worse, but that's still to come. So, what's up with the gameplay?It's kind of flawed. You see, you're extremely over-powered. The enemies have NO DAMN CHANCE against you, because of either their massive brain damage, or bad programming. It's easy to beat them up with a handful of slashes with the sword, it's easy to execute them with a pistol, it's easy to screw them up with a crowssbow, it's HELL EASY to sneak up on them and cut their throats, and don't even get me started on the non-lethal methods. And that's the problem I was talking about before:There are multiple endings, and there are tons of fun ways to annihilate those peasants the game tells you they're your enemies. But you know what? Killing people won't allow you to see the GOOD ending. And is it fun to sneak up on people and ocasionally knock down the few guards who won't let you go unseen? Frankly, no. I love stealth based games, like Deus Ex. And in Deus Ex HR, they did a good job with all of that crap. But in here? They kinda messed it up. Stealth is boring, combat is fun, yet repetitive, BUT YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING GOOD OUT OF IT, SO STAY IN THE SHADOWS AND GET BORED.The game also has a few DLC's, but seriously, why should I give a crap about mission-packs, and why they expect me to pay for them? I do recommend this game, don't get me wrong. It's fun for a while. But you should not buy it at full price, unless you like wasting money. Calling this a stealth game is like calling modern CoD games GOOD. This is, rather, a weird hack-n-slash game, with some escort missions and stealth based gameplay. So, 3€ for this? Fine. 60€? F#ck off.And this thing better not get any sequels. I don't want to see Dishonored 2 for 70€ for the rest of my life.EDIT: F#ck my life, it's actually getting a sequel. I CALLED IT, I FORESAW THIS!

												Wow, what a great experience. The moment I started my first mission Dishonored instantly became one of my favorite games. The game just oozes with style, the art direction is really something special and the music and voice acting are just terrific.Think of Dishonored as a mix of Bioshock and Deus Ex Human Revolution. You'll be playing the game in first person view, while assassinating certain targets. There are literally multiple ways to complete your objectives and there are quite a lot of sidequests to do as well. You can dispose of your targets by using weapons, magic or stealth, or any combination of those. There are multiple endings as well, so different playstyles are definitely encouraged.This game just has so much freedom; it's a fantastic feeling ! Play it and you'll see what I  mean.If you call yourself a serious gamer Dishonored is a must play and must own. Buy it already, we want a sequel ![Rating: 93/100]			"

Visual really great and detail, every mission have side quest, easter egg also some funny part. sometimes i laugh at middle of mission since i hear or see something. Gameplay it self is top tier. it make stealth action fps with element of RPG. we can choose our path. first time i play i kill many AI who cross line with my path. but after few mission i learn something, i make mistake. i become clean hand stealth. this so... cool for me. which really rare we learn moral issue in games.i put Dishonored as my GOTM for SEPT 2014			"

												Ill start this review by saying the game was awsome, well built, awsome graphics for 2012 standards and the story captivated me since the first 5min untill the end. Took me 90h to end the game up till its last mission saving beautifull Emily.  So yeah, if you havent play this you are sure missing out.HOWEVER, i finished the game with only 17 achievements unlocked. So i did some research and it turns out you got almost never kill anybody and go full stealth to to unlock most of the achievements. WAT DAFUK IS THAT?! I mean i tryed to stealth out some mission but it aint nearly as fun as havocing everywhere with your powers and guns, because, its the essence of the game, your sword plus your guns and arrows in a twisted 19th century ambient like a real full fledged British Corsair. I really took some thout whether i would classify my review as positive or negative, but those achievements cant get out of my head because i am a legit gamer and love to unlock the most achievements i can by playing the games. So yeah, the core game: 8/10.Overall (because of the achivement mechanic) : 6/10Im off to Dishonored 2 now, wish me luck xD			"

												Dishonored by Arkane Studios brought back the memories of classic PC games like Thief or Deus Ex, the constant need of exploring just one another room, reading just another little note, and then ending up playing for 10 hours straight. Games like these are a rarity in this day and age. This is not your average cookie-cutter first person shooter; I’d even dare to call it a first person stealth choose-your-own-adventure game. You can play it like an FPS. You can play it as a stealth game. You can play it as a mix of both. You can kill everyone in the room, or you can leave no trace behind. The choice is yours.You control Corvo Attano, a personal bodyguard to the Empress of Dunwall, a fictional steampunk city based on London (though all the voice actors are American, which is a weird decision). About a minute into the game the Empress gets killed, her daughter gets kidnapped, and you get framed for the murder of Her Highness.  Exploring the beautifully crafted city is a great pleasure, although the actual situation in the city is far from lovely. Not only is the crime rampant, but the rat plague is killing citizens not by dozens or hundreds, but by thousands. During your playthrough, about half of Dunwall is already dead, as commented by the city guard. The moments in games when I think “wait, this is ♥♥♥♥ed up” are extremely rare. Seeing a wagon dropping dozens of dead bodies was one of those moments. The wagon appears again and again, throwing off bodies wrapped up in filthy bandages. It empties up and returns full again. The world of Dishonored is brutal, every character you encounter has his own agendas and reasons for acting the way he acts, and nothing is ever black or white.The approach you take when blasting (stealthing?) through missions is entirely up to you, and you have a nice variety of supernatural powers at your disposal. Do you want to wreak havoc upon your enemies? You’re likely to invest in a Devouring Swarm ability, which creates a devouring swarm (sic) of rats that attack your enemy and then clean up by eating their body. Neat. Are you MGS or pre-2006 Splinter Cell fan? You’ll probably want to upgrade Dark Vision and Possession, one of the most useful tools when it comes to stealth playthrough. Each of the nine missions is designed as a sandbox. Theoretically you could go for an objective marker (which you can turn off, by the way) and finish Dishonored in about 5 hours. But if you want to do that, it’s not the game for you. There are multiple sidequests in each of the missions, and some of them will bring repercussions in the future. The game offers you a choice- do you want a free rune that lets you upgrade your character? OK, but you’re going to have to poison Dunwall’s distillery by the request of a crazy lady. Do you want to kill the real murderer of the Empress, or give him a message and only steal his pouch that he carries by his side? Regardless of your choice, it’s worth playing through the game a second time, just to see the different ways people react to you whether you slaughter everyone or leave unnoticed. By the way- even though you’re an assassin, you can finish the game without killing a single person. That’s right. In times when 3-hour-long corridor shooters earn numerous GOTY awards and critical acclaim, an offer of a choice like this is an excellent touch.Summing up, Dishonored is a game that begs to be played at least twice. No playthrough will be the same, whether because you choose to end a sidequest differently, upgrade your character in a different manner, or skipping some chunks of content by mistake, because you weren’t patient enough to listen to the guards’ conversation which unlocked a non-lethal way to accomplish your assignment. The over the top picturesque artistic design, fantastic supernatural abilities, excellent voice acting and music, and most importantly- the freedom to tackle the missions in dozens of different ways make this my game of the year.

												I got this one for 10€ + 5€ with the currently available DLCs. Let's see what you get for your hard earned money:The base game contains nine missions that will take you - depending on your game style and skill - around nine hours. And now we are already at the major point of this game. Your game style. That's what makes this game unique. You are able to choose between a lot of ways to get to reach your goal. You can kill everybody with your crossbow, your gun, with granades or your sword or invoke a crowd of deadly rats,... or you can sneak and talk with allies and try to avoid killing a single person (what is definitly manageable).To bring it to the point: Dishonored is a very thrilling game if you are playing it like a spy, but it's a damn bad FPS, if you try to have fun with killing NPCs. The IA is dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and it's not fun to fight against the clone enemies. Let me count the enemy types,.... 70% are the casual guards, 10% are the one with masks, 10% are the Assassins, 5% are the dogs together with the rats that are attacking you and the other 5% are the guards with this kind of music box that is freezing your mana and lowering your health constantly.I got the DLCs for cheap and I'm really happy that I did not spent even more money on them because they are weak. Knife of Dunwall is the only story DLC and contains three missions. That would not be bad if one of the missions would not be 1:1 copy from one of the base game. So you are getting two levels, one new grenade type and... and I think two new abilities (but also ""lose"" two old ones from base game - because you are playing another character).Is it a bad game? No! It's a nice game with a very unique graphic style, it's running smooth, the gameplay is solid but the recycled levels, the lack of enemy variety, the very unsatisfying AI, the bad cliffhangers at the end, the muddy story(telling) and above all the amount of wasted potentional bring this game down to the other average games we all played and thought ""Why,....why did'nt you made this right? All tools are already there!""Gameplay 7/10 (thrilling sneaky parts VS dumb AI and quicksafe & quickload)Story 6/10 (the story is starting very good,...but at the end you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ what happens and why you are doing all this♥♥♥♥♥♥Music 5/10 (I really have to say that I did not even noticed,...can't be special at all)Longevity 6/10 (well, I played 25 hours. 2x main story + achievement whoring, 1x DLC and a short trip to the challenges DLC)Replayability 7/10 (You can play the base game and also the DLC 1x sneaky and 1x like a psycho murderer.... so it's not that bad....but you don't have the option to keep your skills(runes) and try to max everything out or something like that. The only motivation could be to get every achievement....but look at me. I made 76% of them and I'm not that motivated to play this game once again.)If you like games where you can sneak around and that's thrilling you, get it. If you like to play a game twice to try out different decissions, get it. But if you prefer to shoot everybody down and think this game will have a story like Bioshock or Deus Ex.... no dude. I'm sorry to say, better to keep your money.73/100 "

												Amazing game!One of the best atmospheres i've seen in a long time.You get totally immersed in it.The main story is a bit short but makes up with amazing gameplay in an open level design sort of like the old hitman games but bigger and in first person camera.The many different ways to approach the missions give the game lots of replayability.I've already spent 50 hours in it without even touching the dlc, just experimenting.The textures sometimes might be a let down from up close but after an hour in the game you will completely ignore it.If i had to give a score to this game it would be 9/10.This game is a jewel and i definitely reccomend it!

												Before purchasing this game, I wasn't really thinking much of it. It was just going to be a pass time game for me... For when other games got a bit boring for me, the main one being CS:GO. After hours of gameplay, the game got me hooked. This game feels like you completely have the freedom to do as you please. In missions, you have many ways to approach them, not to mention the amazing weapons and abilities you can use.  I now find myself periodizing this game over all others. I've now abandoned my friend's five queue on CS:GO. I've left my job, my wife, kids, and I'm 3.2 milliom dollars in debt, but this game keeps the mood up. Definitely worth the money.			"

													I'm stalking my prey, two tallboys, elite guards who wear suits of plated armor with spindle legged armatures that help protect them from the plague rat swarms and would be assailants; just outside of the imposing Boyle mansion, of whichI must gain access in order to assassinate Lady Boyle, one of your targets on a long list. I could just merely bypass these two tallboys, and gain entry as I had procured an invitation from my previous mission, of courseI'll still need to sneak past him.. No, I instead decide that because this is the first time you encounter these guards (almost midway into Dishonored) and because I am doing a high chaos playthrough. I will kill both tallboys. I wait for the opportune moment to present itself, when both tallboys and a single City Watch guardsman are in close proximity, and so now I spring into action..I sprint towards my targets, and because of my upgraded boots my footsteps pound the pavement silently. I use Bend Time, then time completely stops, I then use Blink and am teleported up onto the shoulders of the first tallboy, I drive my blade through his neck, andbefore his blood begins to gush out, I blink onto the next tallboy, running him through the neck as well, I then jump off and air assassinate the lone city watch guardsman. And just as quickly as it began, it ends and time returns to its normal progression. I don't have to worry about the bodies either, thanks to Shadow Kill, which turns my enimies into ash upon death. All is quiet, no alarms sounding in the distance, no footsteps coming towards me, no shouts. Just the ambient sounds of the night, the party that is raging wihin the Boyle mansion. I proceed down the street that lines the garden of the Boyle mansion, I find a sewer duct and pass underneath it to access a side street that will take me to the doorman. I stroll up to the doorman and present my invitation. I then proceed inside of the mansion. This is the perfect party, as everyone is wearing a mask..I'll blend right in. Dishonored..is a story about revenge, how you choose in which manner to seek your revenge, is up to you. You play as Corvo Attano, known as The Royal Protector, whoturns into an assassin to seek revenge, you are given supernatural abilities in order to achieve your objectives.  As well as a mask to conceal your identity.   The world of Dishonored is both captivating and grim, yet this world that Arkane has created is beautiful. The atmosphere in Dunwall is well done. The art direction is also nicely done with an 18th century oil painting cast over everything. The buildings, streets and machinesare victorian-esque mixed with steampunk. You'll easily find yourself immersed in Dunwall. In terms of graphical fidelity, this game won't push your system and you'll often find many areas with low resolution textures, of which the oil painting overcast helps to conceal, it's done nicely, but you can still notice it at times. For the most part, however you'llbe too enthralled with the events taking place and enjoying the gameplay itself. There is nothing ugly about Dishonored's looks, it's style. In fact I find it refreshing.Dishonored allows a great deal of freedom for the player to go about completing their mission. The level design is nicely done, even if it is a bit linear. I found it frustrating at times when I wanted to reach a certain rooftop or ledge in order to go about completeing an objective, but could not do so, despite the Blink ability being able to easily reach the areas in question.  The possibilites of executing your missions are various, this does depend on what powers you choose to invest in, and your overall play style. Dishonored is able to suit it, for the most part. Corvo can use Posession to possess animals and people alike to bypass an area, or Corvo can use Devouring Swarm to distract guardsmen for example. There are many other possibilites. Dishonored is very much a story driven game, and while I will come up front and say that the writing isn't the best, it's a nice change from the typical type of writing we see in games today. There are a few moments where the writing is a bit clever, but for the most part it's straightfoward, this doesn't really cheapen the overall  experience of the story, even though what will occur next is predictable. I found the story intriuging enough, enough to invest myself into it and enjoy it for what it is. Decisions that you make also have an impact on certain events and the world of Dunwall. These impacts are limited, not as extensive as youcan find in a few other games. Corvo, himself is silent, he never speaks a single word throughout the entirety of the game. The game itself is quite short, however, this isn't a bad thing. The story is good, and besides you can play Dishonored in a number of ways. Non-lehtal, ghost, low chaos, a mix, or the opposite.Each run will will provide a different play experience and to a limited extent the story as well. I won't go into the aspects of the story any further, as to do so would reveal spoilers. The gamplay itself is fun and addicting. Each level is a playground for Corvo, and your powers will be your most used toys. Dishonored is an FPS, but it is unlike any that I've played before, and so it does not play like your average FPS title. The weapons at your disposal are limited, but these weapons can be upgradedand with upgrades comes visual changes to the weapon you've upgraded. At no point did I ever feel as though there wasn't enough at my disposal. Between your weapons and your powers, you have everything that you need, I like this design choice because it allows you, as the player to focus more on the story and the gameplay and less on which weapons or items should you take along with you. It's all with you already. By the time the first mission is over you have all of the weapons you'll have during the game, minus a couple of items like grenades and spring razor traps. The crossbow can fire multiple ammo types. Regular, sleepdarts and explosive arrows for instance. The gameplay never becomes dull, it remains refreshing, the gameworld introduces new enemies at the right intervals to keep the pace nice and fresh when sneaking about...or killing everyone. And while you are very vulnerable and can only take a couple of hits, you'll find that you feel like you are a master assassin! The audio in Dishonored is a rich experience, more so if you have 5.1 surround. The ambient sounds really adds to the game and helps you become more absorbed in the atmosphere. Footsteps can be heard clearly, rats scurrying about, guards talking, the wind blowing, music, fireworks, those who are infected withthe plague groaning and vomiting, the clash of steel on steel, gunshots ringing out. Sound is one of your key allies, it helps you determine when and where to move, when to take an unsuspecting guard out as well. It's also important for overhearing conversations as you'll often get clues by eavesdropping. However,if you rely on Dark Vision a lot, the ambient sounds of the game is significantly reduced. As for the voice overs, the male NPCs were done well enough, though not top notch, as were the key female NPCs, howeverthe rest of the female NPC voice work was done by one woman and when you hear the exact same voice from so many different women in the game, it breaks the immersion somewhat, it's a bit jarring.The controls of Dishonored are your standard layout where KB/M is concerned. I found the controls to be responsive with the exception that using Blink sometimes resulted in a delay. I also found that I tended to use the selection wheel by clicking and holding the middle mouse button, as opposed to using 1-10 keys for quick swaps. All the keys can be rebound, Dishonored is a game of options. You can customize your experience from FOV slider down to rat shadows, and you can choose which HUD elements will show, if any at all.

Posted: January 12, 2014
												So I just finished this game. I have to say - I absolutely loved the story, the setting, and the way your choices affected the way events played out. The game itself is played as a relatively short series of relatively long missions. Along the way, there's many things to collect that can easily be missed - bone charms that disappear if you don't nab them at a certain point, changing audio logs of NPCs and fleeting conversations. The former can be a bit frustrating, but the latter is always fun to collect, and illustrates the characters around you nicely. The powers were quite fun to use, and the game provided many, many ways to proceed on missions; things were never impossible, but having a certain ability would often open up a path. My largest complaint, however, would be that the game hands you a wide arsenal of killing tools and powers and then heavily discourages using them. The game has, basically, two paths; low chaos (nonlethal, stealth) and high chaos (lethal). There's a third tier, very high chaos, which is for the most part the same as high chaos, but nets even worse reactions from your allies (at this point, your Corvo Attano is pretty much murdering everyone he sees for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.) High chaos is easier to do at the beginning, because you don't have many powers yet, and the early missions take place in populated areas - but as the game progresses, high chaos creates more enemies, worse situations, crueller allies, and darker endings. It's understandable and rationalized from a story perspective - more bodies means more rats means more plague, and your allies follow the example you make - but given how much gamers are used to killing the bad guys being a core part of games - well, expect to spend some time adjusting with Dishonored, unless you want to see cute little Emily devolve into a tyrant. Also, if you're playing stealthy, which you should be - well, expect a lot of save scumming. When I played, I was saving on average of once every two minutes, sometimes even more often.			"

												Incredible game, smooth gameplay, brilliant story. It's a cross between two other incredible games: Rage and Half Life 2.  Set in the 1800s, before the wide use of crude oil, the game's characters fuel their world with refined whale oil. There is a Technocracy which suffers some political drama at the start of the game that the player has to advance from. The controls are simple and yet there are so many options for play and movement. I did get stuck in two places in the game where my avatar could not move and I had to load from autosave. I felt that something I shouldn't have happen in an AAA game. However, the game is so incredible in every other way that I just overload it!I highly recommend this game and it's one of the few games where I play it from start to finish. I may even play it again, which is something I don't think I've done for ANY GAME EVER!			"

												This is the best purchase i've made in 3 years, loved every bit  of this game. An actually good plot twist and storyline,  nice gameplay and visuals, some audio glitches for me, but i guess its just my computer.Watched myself become a cold blooded killer in mere 10 hours,  all  the npc's hate me , so i killed them. 10/10 , definetly gonna replay this game.*update* Played this game a second time, this time finished it in low chaos. Saw that choices really matter, it affects how your friends see you  and how the town and ending turns out.  In High chaos  my friends betrayed me, and looked at me as a filthy monster who only desires to kill,  the  atmosphere was always dark  and gloomy, and the young empress even painted me as a masked monster   with a knife on the streets.Low chaos was  harder to achieve,  i  always wanted to kill  them all, but i  had to resist, in the end it was so worth it.Also this game offers three  DLC, so far i've only checked out one which allows you to  play as  the   Assassin who killed your Empress, really well made  DLC.

												I bought this game, because a friend recommended it, and I saw that 97 % of its players who reviewed it recommended it. Having played and enjoyed many games with much less recommending percentage, I thought that this would be a very good game. I do like stealth.First time I played 119 minutes straight. Last moment to get an easy refund. I knew nothing of the game beforehand. I thought that okay this doesn't seem to be that good, but it seemed to be worth playing through. After playing one more hour, I wished I could refund the game. The game world was bizarre. I don't like the setting, Victorian style mixed with magic. I can't explain, but it just doesn't click.Towards the end, I gradually liked the game more and more. Though the game world was off-putting, the game mechanics were actually nice and enjoyable. All in all, if you like stealth games and Victorian style mixed with fantasy, I would recommend this to you.			"

												Awesome stealth action game with high replay value. Does punish you a bit if you use all the fancy tools it gives you, but it's a small price to pay for some of the amazing senarios and combos one can pull off. REally cheap on sale too, and better than the squel.			"

												Great game with stealth mechanics and story. Unlike some games stealth does not feel forced, but it is very encouraged, especially to get items and achievements. This game has replayability to it due to the multiple ways to play as well. The game on normal was difficult, but not hard enough I had to goto sites to look up how to kill this or that boss... sometimes that stuff is annoying.Pros:-Great graphics for the most part.-Effects are stellar and they make great use of lighting effects with sunbeams etc.-Story is involving, though some parts are a tad predictable it was interesting.-Varied ways to play the game. Most of the game revolves around stealth, but you can decide hoe much you want to stealth play or how you want to stealth play etc.- Game has LOADS of achievements...- Your actions affect the game world in concurring levels, such as more kills = more rats etc.Cons:- While the FXAA was decent in this game, I was disappointed that Dishonored does not have AA. For the most part this did not affect the game, but if you were looking off into the distance, the city looked like jaggedy edges.- Not much is shown of Corvo in storyline videos or in third person. I was disappointed in this.- I think some things in the game could have been explained more, there is a character named ""The Outsider"" who it really tells little about him.All in all this was a good game... the graphical issues I believe derive from the fact the game is a port from consoles. I wish that game makers would make less ports and make more games so that computers can take advantage of their power.			"

												It's been criticized for its short storyline and its apparent copying of games such as Deus Ex, Assassin's Creed and Bioshock, but damn if Arkane didn't pull it off amazingly. Dishonored is highly immersive and an extremely fun game. The graphics are nice, gameplay is smooth and easy to understand, and the story is very intriguing. As I mentioned, the campaign is a bit on the short side, but the game does offer some degree of replayability due to the multiple methods you are offered in taking out your enemies. Similar to Deus Ex and Hitman style games, you have a ton of options on how you want to play the game. Whether you prefer to sneak by every guard undetected, or rush through with guns blazing and sword drawn, it's up to you. You don't even have to kill your assassination targets; instead you can find clever ways of making sure they're never seen again. The music is also absolutely amazing, and I'd hope to see an official soundtrack released at some point in the future. All of this combined with the Dunwall City Trials DLC (in which you compete with other players online in various mini-missions to gain the high score) makes this game a must-play, and one I wouldn't pass up lightly.

												Games as beautiful, fun, and engrossing as this don't come around everyday, which only serves to intensify the frustration that the story has no wind in its sails. It would have been easy enough to explain the protagonists' powers using the gorgeous whalepunk setting, the developers felt it necessary to force in witches, gods, and enough thematic references to Bioshock to make you sick. This game is certainly jaw droppingly gorgeous, plays arguably better, and the powers are very, very fun (you'll spend all day blinking to across rooftops), but ultimately you'll feel as if more focus on the rat plague and the central characters would have made you care more. It may never be Bioshock, as it desperately wants to be, but that won't stop you from enjoying every single minute inside this game. Forget the story they give you, and enjoy the amount of actual playing you can achieve, and you will be handsomely rewarded.			"

												Like a suckerpunch Dishonored floored me without me being prepared the slightest for it. A well written story, immersive gameplay and beautiful art direction made this game soar straight to the top of my favorite games that I've played. The diffrent endings give it some type of replayability, if not only for the ending itself but how you solve the missions as well.You are a assassin with the ability to see through walls, teleport and stop/bend time. If that doesn't get you hot and botherd I don't know what will. Seriously, go buy it.			"

												This game is very well done. It is a little slow paced for me, but for FPS/Stealth fans, this is a great game, that offers a vastly different but fun experience than your normal stealth or fps games. The world in which this game takes place really is incredibly done, you really feel immersed in it even though its not an open world FPS per say like Far Cry 3 or others. Simply put it wasn't a GOTY for nothing, and if you are even a little interested by what this game has to offer, you will be happy you picked it up.			"

												This is game is one of those REAL STEALTH GAMES, meaning there's actually a need to sneak, not like that other assassin game :P This game requires a lot of patientce, although you could finish the game within a day, you'd be missing out on the back story of things. Pay attention to details, for they also add color to the picture. Lot's of books and notes around here, pretty weird stuff but quite interesting.This game is just one of those games where you can be really creative with your approach to situations, sometimes you could even get carried away with the many things you can do within the game. Pretty good mechanics, lots of stuff around. Players looking for a challenge can go try playing the game with just the blink ability and finish the game without acquiring other abilities and/or enhancement.The only downside to this game for me is that it doesn't include a variety of graphics settings, you'd have to tweak things in the ini file and add better AA via your video driver. But doing those things is just a one time task and you'll be enjoying the rest of the game without them jaggies :PAll-in-all a really great game which definitely deserves the title Game of the Year :D			"

												Set in a very interesting world where your actions affect the outcome of the story - one can choose to assassinate everyone and everything or simply subdue the enemy and complete each mission with non-lethal means of action. Dishonored was most enjoyable because of the freedom one had in the process of completing the game, if you aren't much of an explorer you can choose to complete the game in a matter of a few hours simply by doing just the necessary missions that follow the main storyline but you're also able to sweep every corner of every map, thoroughly, to find all the coins (used to buy upgrades and consumables), runes (used to learn different abilities, such as increased running speed, teleportation etc.) and bone charms (used as small perks), should you wish to.If you're an experienced firstperson PC-gamer you can have a lot of fun playing around in this game, even at the harder difficulties - the more skilled and faster you are, the more of an advantage you've got on the world around you.Interesting story, interesting gameplay and very interesting characters - recommended for any stealth/assassin enthusiast as well as the casual murderer.

												Dishonored is a great game with a smooth playstyle behind it. Allowing the player to choose to play non-lethal or go full on assassin killing everyone in sight quietly or even going in guns blazing. As expected from a Bethesda game the story is very well done and engading with good twists and turns. The game is a bit short though but is a great stepping stone to what could be an amazing franchise for the company although with a few improvements. A Dishonored 2 could see some improvements by making the entire game open world with more expansion on the side quests and powers available. I'd give it a 8/10 and only holding back a 10/10 is due to the lack of an open world gameplay.			"

												One of my absoulte favourite first-person titles of all time. A well-crafted combination of Half Life, Thief and Mirror's Edge combining into a unique blend of stealth, action and storytelling unlike any other game. Audiovisually impeccable, Dishonored let's you explore and be amazed by it's architechture, and it's characters, while not necessarily the smartest in gaming history, are some of the most colourful and well-acted I've ever seen.To top things off, I'll make an exception to my usual ""no DLC ever"" -policy and recommend the two story DLC packs for this game as well. Neither of the DLC's alone is much, but together they weave into the story of the main game and fill the player in on one of the least fleshed out, yet most important characters in the game.My only gripe is the passivity of the protagonist, Corvo, as his fall during a certain point in the game feel far too forced. Still, this game comes highly recommended, despite a minor gripe here or there.Playtime: 25+ hours (single playthrough, including DLC)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 10Audio: 10Story: 9Gameplay: 9Overall: 9			"

												Real good stealth game, however one minor gripe I have with it is that its the kind of stealth game that makes you feel like you messed up when you kill enemies but makes every cool weapon and ability lethal. I recommend playing a stealthy, lethal run for your first time to get maximum enjoyment because you really miss out on a lot of cool abilities and weapons if you dont.			"

												Such  a great game.I love the nearly uncountable possibilities, the fact that every murder influences the whole game and i love the scenrio of the rodden city. I could completely feel with corvo, i dived into this game and it felt like i were in another world.The behaviour of the main characters is realistic in my opinion, the story is nothing mega special but still worth having a look maybe.Maybe you can rush this game in quiet a little time, but when you feel the world and if u chose the perfect level for you, you should have a challenging, fantastic experience in this game.

												Coming to the market from people blatantly trying to recreate a work like Thief the Dark Project, I bought this game with some skepticism.  I leave a skeptic as akways, but it is certainly worth the purchase for someone interested in the genre.  Gameplay:Dishonered lets you float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, almost to the point where you feel like you are playing Theif with cheat codes.  This feeling of absolute power seems to stem mostly from the absolute power of being able to blink (teleport short distances) which is probably the most valuable power you could ever dream of controlling in a stealth genre game.  The game manages to create a set of mechanics that allow you to approach a situation from many possible angles, allowing your individually crafted outcome to become something quite unique.  However, I felt the environments were still stagnant, and never really forced myself to approach problems from new and unique angles.  Dishonered throws you all the God like toys, but it never really forces you to get creative with them and really push the limits of the puzzle aspect it provides you.  Overall the game feels a bit too easy, finishing in just over 20 hours, with the only replay content being some DLC and going scavenging for missed runes and charms which is simply no fun for someone like me.  A note: games like this tend to boast their open ended approach, but in the end it still feels like you are being led along at the end of a leash.  Each objective is tagged with an omniscient arrow, which if you disable, you may easily be clueless about where to go next.Story:I found the story interesting enough, and it wasn't terribly difficult to sympathize with your character (Corvo's) plight.  There were many missed and unread notes and many nuances I probably didn't pick up from the extended material, but it is all saved in your journal so you can go back and read.  There seemed to be a definite morality system based on your action, big and small, and somehow I ended up being an agent of chaos, even though I felt like I tried my best to be a good guy.  Some larger decisions feel rather forced, and since my gamplay was very intermittent, I felt like I didn't have enough information about who should be saved and who should be eliminated.  I find games that constantly nag me to be the purveyor of some arbitary justice to be a bit forceful and annoying. In other words, I feel like they throw these situations at you because they know its this idea that theoretically all gamers crave weird difficult moral scenarios, so they throw a few random decisions your way because their producers breathe down their necks about it.overall i give it a 4/5, worth it, but could be better.

												So I'm a fan of sneak-em-ups waaay more than shooters and this game totally appeals to the back-stabbing, sneaky, murdering, revengeful psychopath inside me. That you have both science and magic in your arsenal to draw on only serves to heighten the fun and amusing ways you can dispatch your enemies. Particular mention needs to go to the contextual world and alternate endings that had me play through multiple times using different tactics just so I can see the impact I had on the little girl I saved... both good and bad, joyous. Bring on the sequel.			"

												Set in a very interesting world where your actions affect the outcome of the story - one can choose to assassinate everyone and everything or simply subdue the enemy and complete each mission with non-lethal means of action. Dishonored was most enjoyable because of the freedom one had in the process of completing the game, if you aren't much of an explorer you can choose to complete the game in a matter of a few hours simply by doing just the necessary missions that follow the main storyline but you're also able to sweep every corner of every map, thoroughly, to find all the coins (used to buy upgrades and consumables), runes (used to learn different abilities, such as increased running speed, teleportation etc.) and bone charms (used as small perks), should you wish to.If you're an experienced firstperson PC-gamer you can have a lot of fun playing around in this game, even at the harder difficulties - the more skilled and faster you are, the more of an advantage you've got on the world around you.Interesting story, interesting gameplay and very interesting characters - recommended for any stealth/assassin enthusiast as well as the casual murderer.

Disclaimer: This only a review of the Dunwall City Trials DLC and not the full game. I'll write the full review later (This is an awesome game!) but I need to get this off my chest.Dunwall City Trials DLC is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It is everything Dishonored isn't. It's almost like it's from a different and a more crap game. What it is is a series of challenge maps, all testing a different ability. Except it's not at all about skill. It's mostly random chance plus memorization. I am not even joking when I say there is an actual map where you get bonus points for taking a lucky guess instead of actually doing what you are suppose to do. The ♥♥♥♥ing thing rewards luck! You have to be ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me...All the maps tell you how you can beat them in the beginning but that is a one big stinking lie. If you follow those instructions the game will only give you 1 star and tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off.  You'd think you would have a variety of different ways of solving a map but no. There is only ONE solution to each map and you must follow that solution to a t. If do anything even slightly different, if you are one pixel off, yet get the same result anyway it doesn't matter, you won't get 3 stars. It's discouraging creativity. And even when you know the solution you still have to do it 10-20 times before it feels like admitting your success.It's unimaginative, frustrating and not fun. I hate it. I hate it with passion.I hate this DLC because I like Dishonored. I hate it because this is a blemish on a good game. ♥♥♥♥ THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥TO HELL!			"

												One of the amazing things about Dishonored is how vast the gameplay can be. You stealth it out, using sleep darts and choke holds for a nonlethal approach, or you can charge into battle with your sword, crossbow, and demonic powers. The gameplay accomodates for both, giving plenty of customization and augmentation for your weapons and abilities. Every single choice you make throughout the game, from character dialogue to deciding to kill someone, can lead to a different ending. Truly, Dishonored is an amazing game, with a whole world of options at your disposal.			"

												Dishonored might be one of the absolute best games released this decade, it features a very interesting universe resembling a Steampunk Victorian London, designed by the AD from Half-Life 2, with gameplay highly reminiscient of Thief, in fact I would go so far as to call it a spiritual successor to Thief in many ways. It is also heavily inspired by Bioshock, Deus Ex and The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. The story and gameplay consistently superb and the game is tailored after your playstyle. If you go for stealth and non-lethal options, for example, the outcome of the game will be much less dark than if you go for a direct and lethal way.I would highly recommend this game, to anyone who want that little extra in a game, and to fans of any of the franchises mentioned above.

												As part of a generation of self-proclaimed ""Final Fantasy Allstars"", it was always hard for me to really give other RPGs other than Chrono a real chance.  It was always me asking myself, ""What could this other game that looks alright, really give me in a 50+ hour playthrough, that I couldn't get out of another run through any of my favorite Final Fantasies."" I then sat through the opening sequence of Dishonored.  What Bethesda and Arkane do here is a slice of the steampunk cake, that makes me want to sit here and keep eating until there is nothing left.  Albeit a story which really gets hacked off at the knees with a rather weak ending, the environment and sound-tracking for Dishonored finds me hard pressed to suggest another RPG outside of my FF comfort zone. I had also never dabbled in the stealth games before, but even though that wasn't my thing when I started, and I hacked my way through the storyline, Arkane built the game so that based on type of play the storyline sees real changes.  If you are going to break out the digital wallet to pick up a new game, the game design alone had my steampunk and proto-industrial side poking like a nail, and everything else the game had to offer was just a huge plus.  Don't buy any other RPG, except maybe what I remember as being a reformatted FF8 (New to Steam, but not the same without a controller) - Dishonored is it.  Just exploring Dunwall was more than worth my money - so do it, and you won't regret it.			"

												A fantastic game that combines stealth mechanics with fast-paced action. As the former Lord Protector, being framed for the murder of your Empress is definitely something that grinds your gears, but the game allows the player, as Corvo Attano, to kill everything in sight in an act of vengeance, or to kill those that are deemed necessary to die. This game gives you several choices to make as an assassin. Granted, it's no Mass Effect game, but the decisions to either kill your targets or non-lethally dispose of them can make you feel like an accomplished assassin, or a forgiving hero of the city. The game's story is well thought out and the mechanics are well implemented in the game, my only concern is the growth of Corvo as a character. Understandably, there isn't much for him to learn as a person, seeing as you (the player) all the decisions for him, but it would be nice to see how he handles certain situations when talking to a person, where you make the initial yes/no decision for him and he carries out the actions.

												One of the most important aspects of videogames is a sense of movement, next is impact (how your weapons and movement ""feels""), last is atmosphere.  These are probably the strongest aspects of Dishonored.  The atmosphere is palpably dark, gruesome and hopeless.  The impact of your attacks are satisfying and exciting. But the sense of movement is where this game shines. Second only to the glorious Mirror's Edge, Dishonored feels like a dance, a deadly, dark dance where you are the lead and your enemies follow you.  Usually to their ugly doom.  A must-have game.			"

												Absolutely amazing, if you like stealth/action type games, please consider this. The only part of the game that bored me was waiting for that enemy to walk somewhere that allowed me passage, though after I finally mastered the 'blink' ability about half-way through the game I hardly ever did that. The rest of the game was completely engrossing and satisfying from start to finish. Great story too, I got the happy ending :P			"

												The game seems impossible (or damn close to it) without powers, due to the actually-fairly-good AI and their uncanny nack for looking in all the right places, so your prison escape is usually the most difficult part. Aside from that, the game seems to have a lot of emphasis on ""let's count the ways you can commit mass murder"" for a game that has a pseudo-morality system, the graphics and aesthetic are very nice (if just a combination of Bioshock's aesthetic and Half-Life 2's aesthetic), the gameplay holds up well until the absolute last bit of the absolute last level (where the guards are combination of immovable and clueless, for reasons I can't come up with), there are a fair number of powers but not enough runes to go around and not enough powers that can be used non-lethally (most of them focus on lethality or cause needless death when used), and the audio is very nice.Overall I give it a 4/5 (would recommend if it's $10-15, MAYBE $20), and it could be made absolutely perfect with modding. Personally I've had my fill of the game's mechanics (which for me, boil down to ""blink behind guard, choke guard, hide guard, don't get caught, ad nauseum""), so I'd skip the DLCs.			"

												This is the only game that has managed to make me WANT to play with it's stealth mechanics. All of it feels fluid, useful and trustworthy. You can complete it without ever being seen and/or alerting any enemy, even if it's incredibly hard to do both at the same time.The aesthetics have a touch of steampunk, some Bioshock and a droplet of fantasy games, but soon you forget all of that and just enjoy how good does it all merge.The story isn't spectacular but it's pretty well engrained and hooks you up to the last moment, and it has different endings depending on how you play it.The DLCs are completely optional, and consist on extra missions.Overall, it's an awesome game and you'll hardly regret buying it.9/10			"

												Dishonored is not the best game I have ever played but it is definitely my favourite. Despite having a relatively mediocre story, the gameply and setting of Dishonored stands out as a shining light for video games and the stealth genre alike. The Victorian-esque steampunk city of Dunwall is full of interesting people and dark stories just waiting to be uncoverered through conversations, books and notes. The gameply provides limitless ways to confront each level be it going over the rooftops for the stealthy player or walking in the front door for the less conservative. Or maybe you'd like to take control of a fish and enter the building through the drainage pipes. Dishonored provides invigorating stealth and intense, intuitive combat that will keep you coming back for more.Story: 7.8/10Gameplay: 9.9/10Replayability: 9.5/10Overall Score: 9/10Opinion:LAWesome			"

												There's so much about this game that makes it so interesting. Firstly, I think the entire game looks just beautiful, the artwork and the way the characters are made are just stunning and very interesting. You could say the story was somewhat expectable, but I think that's just a minor issue - although it wasn't the strongest story ever, it was really enjoyable and I would definitely recommend anyone to play through it. The missions were a lot of fun, even with a not-so-strong story supporting them. I thought there was given so much thought to every character, all the characters had more personality than most of the main protagonists in some games you find these days. The story also has a high replayability level, and I would anyone who has played the game recommend to play it another time, but to make completely different choices in the second playthrough, not only does it change the story, but it changes the way the characters react to you and actually the entire environment of the city. Also, PLAY THE DLC'S. It's a shame if you have played through this game but haven't given a glance at the DLC's, this is one of those games were the DLC's might be just as good or even better than the main game itself. Conclusion: Get this game. Don't think twice about it, just... Get it.			"

												This was a cool game. I love the character design, atleast for the main character. The gameplay, for the most part, is exciting. With all of the abilities and options you have at your disposal, you feel very powerful. Sometimes, though, you can be a little too powerful. I played through for the first time on the hardest difficulty without a hitch. It's possible to play through the whole game without being seen or killing anyone, but that can get kinda tedious. Why have all of these brutal abilities if you can't use them? As the game progressed I got more ruthless and stopped worrying about not being seen or not killing. One gripe I have with this game is the skill point collectibles. Since they are necessary to get more abilities, you constantly have to go out of your way to collect them. The story was good and kept me interested the whole time. The world feels alive.			"

												From what i have played of the game so far (less than 10 hours 1-3 missions) the game is fantastic. the art style is amazing but slightly cartoony. This isnt a bad decision its just there. The combat is difficult and you cant just go swinging your sword around like a beserker and win. The game WILL punish you for trying to be a beserker and murder everyone you see. However if you play it quiet and never hurt anyone but your targets the game will reward you in ways i wont spoil for you. The story is very good but slightly predictable. Your the guardian to a queen her bodyguard infact. After she is murdered and she tells you her last words while dying in your arms the guards and conspirators against you find you you're hauled off to jail to await your fate. Unknown allies rescue you and from there the story really gets going. the game loves exploration and manipulation of the games powers. i never had any sort of gamebreaking glitch or texture glitch or horrible AI experience *Cough Rome 2 TW Cough Cough* the AI if it detects you will really try to hunt you down. My one concern is it seemed a little too easy to sneak past but maybe thats because i was playing on normal difficulty. Game mechanics are solid and no two playthroughs will be the same unless you specifically TRY to make it exactly the same. you have a variety of powers that are oh so fun you mess with and you cant have them all so you have to choose wisely. Overall the games a good buy especially at the current 5$ of the sale. Easily worth the 20 though. If you really love the game then the Game of the year edition takes you a step further with Daud the legendary Dunwall assassin who killed the Empress as your main protagonist and his story for redemption. The game is good and is worth a purchase.			"

												Well, I recently finished Dishonored and I can honestly say it was one of the best games I played this year! I did a low chaos run; minimal killing, no alarms from the half-way point onwards. Had lots of fun being the ultimate blinking, time-stopping ninja! :DThe story is a little straightforward, leading you on a path of revenge and redemption after being framed for the murder of the Empress. Missions generally revolve around an assassination target that needs to be removed in order to dismantle the new regime that has seized control of the Empire. There are also some missions that take a different approach (Lady Boyle's party was one of my favorite parts of the game).Your skills start small but can be developed to be quite devastating by the end of the game. It reminds me a lot of a Ninja-Bioshock; granting you an array of magic powers which are always at your disposal provided you have sufficient mana vials. Except in Dishonored you won’t be flinging lightning bolts or jets of fire, instead you are armed by much sneakier skills such as a mini-teleport, mind control, time control and the ability to see though walls.The level design is one of the best parts of Dishonored. While they may seem small or linear at first glance, a player who is willing to explore will find many different routes to their objectives. There are also many hidden items to loot, runes and charms to find which will improve your abilities and lore to be read in the form of notes, books and audio logs.I would strongly recommend Dishonored to the type of player who loves to explore a world, peeling back the layers and really getting absorbed into the experience. While you could play the game by running directly to the objective and killing everyone in your path, I feel you would be robbing yourself of so much more game that is being offered here. "

												It's April 19 in 2014 and I have just finished my first playing of Dishonored.  I picked up the game of the year edition during it's last sale a few weeks ago.  I don't know why I ignored this game for so long.  I even played a demo when it was first released long ago.  It is a complex game with a little learning curve and I didn't realize at the time that Harvey Smith was a creative director of Dishonored.  Deus Ex was a taste changing landmark game for me.  I wasn't paying attention and the demo didn't capture my imagination at the time.  I must have been tired!This is a great first person perspective game with lots of alternative map paths to complete the missions and lots of interesting game play mechanics to change up your approaches to the many missions.  The plot was very involving for me with a great surprise twist in the middle of the game.  The voice acting is great and the dialogue has lots of variation depending upon how ""chaotic"" your play style.    You are going to want to play this at least twice.I am still waiting for that ""good deal"" to update my video card for the next generation so I have played this with a 9800 GT nvidia with just half a gig of video ram.  I can max out all of the settings and it still runs great.  The art work is beautiful.  It all works well and didn't seem at all compromised for performance at all.  You can sleep dart your opponents, sneak by them, kill them with an interesting array of weapons all having attractive displays.  I ended up using ""blink"" and my sword a lot so it ended up being a great sword fighting game for me against other ""blinking"" assassins.  I was pleasantly surprised by this.No one needs this review at this late date but I liked the game so much I just had to do it. "

												I lost count of how many times I've played through this game. I love it, and for so many reasons: plot, gameplay, and replayability, to name a few.First off, the plot it actually very deep. If you're not looking for details you could easily miss it, but when you pay attention you find out all sorts of things. Arkane added a lot of depth to the story to make it more engaging, and even hid a few Easter eggs for players to find (for instance, you can find High Overseer Campbell as a weeper in the Flooded District if you elect to brand him instead of kill him earlier in the game). It's the small things that count: notes and journals that give you a glimpse into life in plague-ridden Dunwall; overhearing conversations between characters, even minor ones; hearing the experienced assassin Daud's lament over killing the Empress. Playing this game and taking the time to scour the maps for clues that reveal plot is one of the more fun and engaging things to do, even if you've finished your first playthrough.Second, gameplay. Ohhhh my, the gameplay. Even without magical powers, the gameplay is fun and there's always someone to stalk and assassinate (or choke out and hide, if that's your style). Drop assassinations never get old, and neither does taking out a Tallboy or taunting guards through an electric field that you rewired (the poor sods). But adding Blink to the party, not to mention the rest of the supernatural abilities, was the cherry on top. Allowing you the ability to do so many things, from moving silently across an open space without notice to appearing in front of an enemy and killing them before they could so much as blink (heh heh), the Blink ability increased the gameplay experience by an order of magnitude.Some gameplay factors also increased the replay value of the game, namely those factors allowing you to choose between options. You get to experiment with so many different ways to take out a target, and if you want to spare his life, there's a way to do that too. Maybe you liked sneaking around on the ground but would like to jump on rooftops more. Do more side quests that you overlooked on other playthroughs. I even knew a guy who did a playthrough that he called ""Extreme Non-Lethal,"" where he went undetected and only choked out the targets he absolutely had to, focusing on finding ways to slip past without being noticed. Even though the game is linear, you are still allowed enough options to permit multiple creative plays of the game, as I have done.It is worth mentioning the game that Dishonored took its notes from, which is Thief: The Dark Project. I am happy to say that Arkane was kind enough to put in an Easter egg in the game in acknowledgement of their inspiration. This can be found in Daud's base, when you stumble across two assassins training for stealth; the dialogue from that scene is taken from Thief: The Dark Project almost verbatim.TL;DR - I found Dishonored to be a very enjoyable game, and I recommend it to anyone who has a love for games featuring stealth or stabbing (don't tell my psychiatrist). It has good graphics, great gameplay, commendable replayability (especially for a single-player game), and an in-depth plot to boot.			"

												Exciting gameplay, there was never a boring (or irritating) level. Levels are well-balanced and there are 1209389302 ways to get to your goal, honest. The world was gorgeous.Creative. Breathtaking. Rarely will you find such an amazing combination of steampunk and supernatural. You'll grow to love the city of Dunwall, even the damn rats.Story-wise... it was a little predictable. It was a matter of when rather than what, but still concrete nonetheless. Recommended! Whether you enjoy the story or found it linear like I did, you'll love the gameplay all the same! Blink and Possession = OP as heck.			"

												The only bad thing about this game is that if you're going for a no kill run be careful where you place your passed out buddies. If rats eat them or they get blown up or they get knocked over and drown or just die from the fall damage that counts as you murdering them. There's another hint for doing a no kill run but it would kinda spoil an aspect of the story so just play the game. Voice acting, level design, story, graphics, etc etc it's all great. And most importantly it's incredibly fun. One of my top 10 games even though it came out just 4 years ago.			"

												I usually only write reviews for the best games in my library, and Dishonored is no exception. At the time of writing this review, I've completed the game and all of its DLCs twice; high chaos and low chaos. Pros The game is designed with every possible playstyle in mind, shown especially through the level design. There's pipes on the sides of buildings, ledges, hidden secrets and plenty to explore. Want to sneak past all of the guards? Easy, just blink between ledges on buildings, over walls, and onto streetlights. Want to kill absolutely everything? No problem, just whip out your trusty pistol/crossbow/otherworldly-tool-of-destruction and blast away at the guards on the street, or maybe grab some whale oil tanks and start exploding things. The gameplay is smooth and phenomenal all throughout.The game is pretty old, but the graphics (or art style, more like) still look pretty good. There's some nice bloom/light shaft effects, and the game doesn't try too hard to look realistic, just pleasant to look at. The closest thing I can compare it to is Borderlands, minus the harsh black lines on everything.There's a hell of a lot of creativity and freedom when it comes to playing the missions. For example, let's say there's five guards in a room. You could throw a grenade in, stop time, and shoot the grenade midair with a crossbow bolt. On the other hand, you could simply blast everyone with a gust of wind, and finish off anyone who didn't die when they hit the wall.This game can run on a potato. Cons The story isn't bad, but it's not great either. You're the royal guard of the Empress, she gets killed in front of you, other government-people rush in and frame you for it. There's that.For new players, there is a bit of trial and error for certain things. This can be a pro or a con, depending on who you ask, but here's some help with that; you can't blink through a Wall of Light. Arc Pylons aren't so dangerous if you're above them or below them. That should save you a couple of deaths if you're new.Not much else in the cons department. Conclusion 9/10, only wish the game could've been a bit longer (there's 9 missions in the main game, give or take 5-6 hours if you know what you're doing). "

												Great game, good depth, with good replayability. You could be mistaken that Valve made this game as you play it. It has that certain feel to it. I enjoyed the storyline, and they did well masking the linear-ness of the game in the beautiful cunstructs of the surroundings, although i finished this game already i am itching to replay it and focus on more of a stealth style completion. Only issue i had was by the end your charactor still isnt maxed out on his powers and you never really get to ""be all you can be"".I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys well told single player fps stories.9/10			"

The one thing that I think the game lacks is the amout of autosaves. Going on to play this game for my third time. Be sure to by the game of the year editon too.			"

												A Worthy Purchase and a Quality Stealth game that truly works with the word Stealth. The main story of Corvo and his climb back up the ladder of betrayal, backstabbing and battling through a City tettering on the edge of total ruin and underhanded higherups fully willing to ride the fall is one that shouldn't be missed. As the story is laid out through missions into and around rat infested Dunwall, Corvo must make his way through the backallies, over the chimneys and into the places normal men refuse. Finding bits of history, listening in on coversations and uncovering just how the City currently suffers in the midst of the slaying of its Empress and the dealings of its scavenging aristocrats really pulls you into a well needed sense of immersion. Some tend to dismiss the game due to the powers gifted to Corvo as he does his dirty work but they make it far from a walk in the park. - Guards, passerbys and any eye you don't want on you will spot you with ease if you don't take them seriously.- Your magic abilites are far from all powerful as well. - While elixers are sadly overly plentiful, running and gunning while guzzling them is a next to impossible play style. - Bonecharms do their job well as a perk system that changes and requires rearranging depending on just how you want to accomplish a goal.- Sleep darts while powerful are not to be relied on or else you will find yourself in more than a few corners. And in true form to accomplishing goals, there are many many ways to approach your missions and the situations they entail. From total slaughter to not even breaking skin is possible. From Ghost to Demon, the game never blocks you off or makes you wish you had taken a different path. At the end of the game, depending on just how you went about it, I'm sure that you'll be far from disappointed it or at most, only disappointed in your own actions. So is Dishonored worth it? Never doubt it.			"

												Dishonored feels like a spiritual successor to the earlier Thief games, but really it's only a game inspired by those great stealth games. It's hard not to notice some of the Half-Life influences and maybe even a little BioShock. Right down to Dishonored's protaginist, Carvo who sort of has a Gordon Freeman vibe. And that's not a bad thing. Unlike Gordon who wears a special suit, Carvo wears a special mask to identify himself as some sort of iconic threat of ""terror"" to the citizens in Dishonored's world, which is quite beautiful thanks to the Unreal Engine. I played the game on normal because I picked this game up on the limited free weekend offer and wanted to play through until the end before this game expired. Unlike the normal mode in the Thief games, Dishonored felt more user friendly and easier. I would hope Hard mode would have offered more of a challenge. Don't get me wrong I died towards certain parts (especially the last mission) and only one area had me really stumped. However, nothing like what I encountered in Thief: The Dark Project. Even though I played mainly for gameplay I didn't really pay attention to the story, but did enjoy the interactive cutscenes, characters, and animation. It's all very well done. Dishonored takes the earlier Thief games and expands and improves on that formula. The gadgets, upgrades, powers, etc are all worthwhile and entertaining even though I didn't experience them all. Dishonored has a world full of immersive atmosphere, beautiful visuals, and addictive fun gameplay. Susan Sarandon even voices a random character, but oddly it feels more like a cameo, but still a cool touch. I am all for these types of stealth games. This is the type of game that totally stands on it's own whether or not a sequel is made.			"

												It is not easy to define Dishonored... Would I buy it again? YesWas an enjoyable experience? YesThe StoryA well written story with a plot that stands up on its own and multiple ending, probably would have been a great plus if the story itself was developed a bit more giving more charisma to the different characters in the game as in plenty of cases the game misses the opportunity to transform a good story in a great story, games like Bioshock are an example of the level of egnadgement can be achieved with few very charimastic characters. Too often speeches are too quick, a missed opportunity to create a great story.AudioThere is not such a thing, I probably notice that a bit late in the game but there is no soundtrack, then again Bioshock was the same. Voices in game well suite the characters. Sound effect are ok, not all level have much atmosphere sound-wise (I played the game with true 5.1 headset). GameplaySomething that reminds me of Bioshock, many things actually reminded me of it without never quiet reach the same quality level, good number and type of weapons and different upgrades, how you equip Corvo will affect the way you play the game it all depends if you are aiming to play stealth or ""fps"" style, this will affect the main story and ending. All kills are more or less similar a bit more of variety would have helped.GraphicProbably the biggest let down, don't take me wrong I am in the team of people saying that graphic isn't all however slightly polished textures and some more particles effects would have helped, the game is still using the Unreal Engine 3 that after so many years shouldn't be something new to programmer. However despite the two points there the game has its own style it is like to be in ""steam-punk paint"" and after the first hour or so you get use to the style adopted and you even start liking it. I probably wouldn't have been happy to pay the game full price, but for £15 is a must have and hopefully the developer will enhance the sequel with a better served story and a more polished graphic. Also the game can be finished pretty quickly however it has a good replay-ability as if you play stealth you may want to see how the story develop when playing with high chaos (killing lots of people in the cruel way possible).Try it, you won't regret it if you can cope with the above points!

												The BEST stealth first person game I have ever played bar none. Good story, good characters, a huge variety of different ways to approach problems based on personal preferences and powers not viability. There's dozens of viable entrances to the locations you need to get to, which you choose really is up to you.			"

												I like stealth games, so I decided to give Dishonored a go. It is fairly good, but who wouldn't expect that from the same guys who made Arx Fatalis?The story is compelling. I'll try and spell this out for you while forgoing the spoilers. You're Corvo, an agent and bodyguard of the Empress, but something terrible happens and you're to blame, stripped of all honorable titles. You must, with the help of some friends, stealthily take down or kill your way through the people who've set you up as the fall guy.The gameplay is simple and probably deceptively so. Basically, you're given the an objective, such as, ""Get from point A to point B and eliminate this target."" You'll encounter enemies along the way and you will have to decided to either kill them, eliminate them non-leathally or just sneak past.To aid you in your quests you're given tools of magically fast loading flintlock pistols and crossbows, a sword and some special abilities. These special abilities will help you either sneak or kill. The most important is probably ""blink."" It's sort of like a teleport, but it's not instantaneous and enemies can see you if you blink in front of them. You can also stop time, possess people and animals, the obligatory ""reveal all enemies and obsticles for a short period of time"" stealth game ability and some other cool stuff. The soundwork is pretty good. Nice, crunchy dissonant orchestral work juxtaposed with some beautiful stuff. My only complaint is that there was one point where there were some fireworks and the sound actually clipped. I hadn't experienced that in a AAA title for... in recent memory. It's not that big of a deal though.The level design is great, as it should be. Stealth games rely on good level design and this one doesn't pull any punches. Almost every enemy encounter is a puzzle in itself with more than a few solutions =)All in all, I'd say I'm pretty happy with Dishonored. I haven't played the DLC, but I'll get into that later.			"

												Dishonored is my all time favorite game to date.It's gameplay is superb, with in-game decisions allowing numerous unique playstyles. The story is engaging, if not entirely unpredictable, and the morality system of the game has just enough effect on that story to give the feeling that your choices are impacting the world as a whole. Graphically, the game is incredibly stylistic, and, while it's texture resolutions or polygon counts might be subpar by todays standards, it achieves beauty without dropping it below 60 frames per second on my lower-end PC.

												This game is great. It's a tonne of fun and I recommend it to anyone who likes stealth games. The only problem I have with this game is that killing everyone and your targets gets you a bad ending and doing everything the non lethal way gets you a good ending. This would be fine if the game didn't seem to be so tailored to you killing people. While there's a million different way to kill targets (And it's probably not lot more fun if you get creative) there's only a couple of ways to non-lethally dispatch enemies, sleep darts and choking them, rendering most powers and upgrades almost useless. This doesn't stop the game from being hella fun though, so buy it.8/10			"

Pros:- No bugs, glitch, or even crashes in this game (at least for me :p)- Multiple Endings !!!- Story is awesome and have alot of twist- You can choose a diffrent approach in every mission (Stealth, Non lethal, Rushed out)- DLC missions are intresting ( IMO, Daud's campaign in dlc expansion has more intresting than actual game Cons: - This game uses Unreal Engine, but the graphic isnt that good you know :)- Story is rather short for me, so i recommend to buy the GOTY edition instead the base game only			"

												I bought this game because it caught my attention. Then, when I played it, I could see that the game was fantastic. The ambient, the fightings, the story ( for the ambient i think that it's around XIV century ), the weapons ( I love the crossbow ), and the rest. Episodes are short, so it's good from my point of view. Because when an episode or chapter are too long the most of people just boring or tired of game. On the other hand, I think that the play with the girl or go after her, it's enough. The game should be focused in others things. But anyway, it's a good game, the ambient and mode of fight it's good and worth buy it. But above all, enjoy it! BE SECRETIVE, BE A FOREIGNER, BE DISHONORED!			"

												This game is amazing. I have played it through multiple times on Xbox and have just now finished it on PC. This game is definitely worth the price, and then some. Had it not been for the graphics making people's foreheads look like the Gobi Desert, it would be pefect. If you overlook the graphics, which are pretty damn good for when it was released, this game could not be better. Corvo is a badass Royal Protector looking for vengeance, and you can kill your way to revenge, or you be all sneaky and assert revenge very very personally. Like knocking out a torturer and tossing him at a wall multiple times and still getting an acheivement for not killing anyone. Oh, and then the DLCs for this game!! Most DLCs for games are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little things meant to make the company money, but these are amazing and alot of fun. You can spend hours, or just rush through, but I recommend taking your time. A side note: Witches and Gravehounds are scary! Ahem-  Continuing on, we are trying to write a review here. Okay.... The story in Knife of Dunwall is okay, but a little short. I did just go on a massacre as being stealthy is a little difficult in this DLC. In the end there is an amazing plot twist. I will not reveal it. But you do play as Daud, the renowned assassin. Brigmore Witches is an amazing experience. I nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself each time the Gravehounds howl. You will definitely need the powers you can buy for this one. Also, I recommend purchasing favors to get things done easier. I eventually got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with the witches and just blew them up cause they're scary, but if you are not scared by evil witches with supernatural powers and dogs that have a hellish howl, you'll be fine. I know this has been a long review, but now I'll tell you about the actual game with no DLCs. It is a great storyline and your choices affect the outcome of the game. You can get high or low chaos depending on you actions. High chaos comes from killing people, and low chaos comes from being stealthy and avoiding them. Try for the Ghost, Shadow, Mostly Flesh and Steel, and Clean Hands acheivements all in one go. I almost succeeded, but upgrading Blink goes against Flesh and Steel. I got the rest though. And not killing payed off with a very nice ending and a great feeling of success. Corvo is the Royal Protector of Lady Emily the Empress. You are framed for a murder and must escape prison. It all goes from that to having to seek revenge against an evil, corrupt tyrant, and choosing to seek revenge on other people that wronged you. It is just an amazing story, and if you made it this far through the review, congratulations!! I would give you a cake, but it's a lie... So have a virtual cookie!! :D And go buy this game now. It's definitely worth the money.On another sidenote: I have only had this game for a week or so on PC and already have more hours on it than I do on GTAV, which I've had since release. Just putting that out there. This game is amazing. And obviously better than GTA.			"

												SUMMARYAmazing blend of stealth and action, with an interesting steampunk universe to explore and loot and an amazing art style from the designers that brought you City 17. THE GOOD-Cool and useful powers for the player to use-Multiple playthrough options and strategies-RPG-lite leveling of skills and inventory to make Corvo a better assassin-Environments are amazing, and a joy to explore-Music is foreboding, and the atmosphere is dripping with styleTHE BAD-The guards repeat a lot of their dialogue throughout the game. It's kind of charming, in a way.-Not the most difficult stealth gameplay once you get used to the game's features, but it soon becomes a challenge of how to use your skills to maximum effect.I highly recommend this game! Especially worth checking out if it goes on sale. The Daud DLC is very interesting, and shows a lot more of the city of Dunwall and the plots surrounding Corvo.			"

												Bought the game at full price and to be honest, the game wasn't too good story-wise. Typical 'get the guys who stabbed you in the back' type of story. Twists were expected and overall, the story felt uninspired. It feels like the story was written by an amateur.In terms of gameplay, I found it to be VERY enjoyable but unrealistic in terms of stealth. I played through the game on the hardest difficulty and it wasn't difficult at all. The AI was predictable but restarting a level puts the AI in random positions which made it unpredictable for the first few tries. Overall? I'd give this game a 7/10 - in an age with broken games, a mediocre fully-working game shouldn't be praised. The graphics are 'meh'. The story is 'meh'. The gameplay is AWESOME!Get the game while it's on sale; I fully recommend it.			"

												Dishonored is an amazing stealth based FPS where you have several different tools to get through each level in your own way. For example, group of 4 guards. You can blink past them and rewire their electric turret to kill each of them in less than a second. Or you can throw a grenade, freeze time and shoot the grenade out of the air with a crossbow. Or you can spawn a pile of flesh eating rats that will eat them alive. Or you can freeze time and shoot each of them with each invididual projectile, which is the normal gun, a normal dart, a sleep dart, and an exploding dart. Or you can lob a tank of exploding whale oil at them. Or you can summon an incredibly strong whirlwind and knock them off a cliff. Or you can simply run up and stab each of them old fasioned style.The possiblities with this game are nearly endless, and it has such a rich story with different endings, that one playthrough is simply not enough. To anyone who wants to be a ghost, a ninja, a warrior or anything in between, play this.10/10. Cheers.			"

												'Dishonored' is a first person stealth rpg game in a steampunk setting with an awesome storyline.First you have to know: The game is published by Bethesda! (Bethesda RPGs are always excellent IMO)You play as Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles, who gets in contact with the Outsider. You level Corvo by collecting runes. Corvo has six active and four passive powers:Active: Dark Vision, Blink, Possession, Devouring Swarm, Bend Time and Wind BlastPassive: Agility, Blood Thirsty, Shadow Kill, VitalityNone of these powers are pointless! You can play Corvo as YOU like to play the game:For example::: Killing slyly out of the shadows by using Blink/Bend Time and Shadow Kill/Blood Thirsty:: Playing non-lethal by using Blink/Possession and Agility:: Being Rambo by using Devouring Swarm/Wind Blast and Vitality/Blood Thirsty:: etc.Pros:+ Awesome sound on vision+ Imaginative abilities + None of the abilities are pointless.+ Excellent storyline+ High replayability+ Smooth course of the game(+ Brilliant DLCs; except ""City Trials"")(+ ""Easy"" collectable achievements)Cons:- not lip-sync- less hostile NPCs- unimaginative weapons (sword, pistol, grenades, mines)(- Graphics are not up to date)Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because of the great storyline and the excellent game mechanics.9/10 "

												Released in October 2012, Dishonored is a stealth action-adventure video game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. Dishonored definitely holds place for one of the best games I have played. Why?Pros: + Amazing artistic capabilities from developer+ Optimization on its peak+ Plot in this game is outstanding+ Unique stealth and assassination mechanics + Unique abilities with variety of kill options+ Voice acting+ Upgrade and abilities system+ It took me about 11 hours to finish the game+ DLC'sCons:- Maybe only complain would be that in order to make all achievements, you have to buy all DLC's.Other then that, this game is very original. I already finished it two times. Second time, I finished it with achievement ""Clean Hands"", which means, you have to finish the game without killing and alerting anyone. So its definitely stealth game, but at the same time the game has one of the most unique lethal mechanics. And I can assure you, you won't regret buying it. Love it!			"

The ""magic"" powers are strangely easy to use.... honestly Lucas Arts could learn something from this type of control for Star Wars Jedi-type games.  The story was great, the characters were believable and had depth, and with the added story of the DLC's, you even come to understand and cheer for the ""villains.""  On a scale of 1-10, I give this one a 9.5.			"

												Should you buy this game? Yes, I believe so. Never doubt it. Great story, great soundtrack, has lots of replayability, lots of side quests and hilarious dialogue from NPC's. The best stealth game I have ever played. 10/10.			"

TechnicalsMenu is responsive and fairly optimized for PC, with plenty of displayed elements and no ridiculously large fonts. Graphical options aren't too varied, but acceptable. There's an FOV slider. There are plenty of gameplay options, such as the ability to hide UI elements or disable tutorial popups. There is no mouse acceleration. Separate audio channels for music/sfx/voice. All in all, it's a solid PC game, with no obvious console influences.GameplayI played on Hard. I hardly engaged in combat throughout the game, so I can't really comment on how the combat is. For what it's worth though, stealth is very very easy in this game. Blink is incredibly overpowered, especially when you consider that enemies take time to aggro. Once you get used to the timings, you can very easily manipulate the AI such that you're just blinking around on the edge of the AI's aggro meter.But stealth is fun. Lots of ways to get around objectives. Maps have lots of verticality, which is always nice for stealth.Combat is not neglected. About half the available powers are combat oriented.ControlsVery fluid! Mouse sensitivity has small enough steps to allow you to fine-tune your sensitivity. No mouse acceleration! Hitboxes are fairly accurate. Guns have no spread, I think. Bullets and projectiles have no drop or damage falloff. Headshots are very satisfying with the brief slow-mo. I think the solid controls are one of this game's main strengths.Collectibles & pick upsEvery map has a number of things to collect, from paintings to runes to bone charms. They're not particularly rewarding or even remotely required to progress though. I pretty much ignored all collectibles because I had no use for gold or power upgrades. I went through the game barely upgrading anything and with only upgraded Blink and Agility powers, and it was easy. Maybe if you were playing on Very Hard and are actively trying to cripple your playstyle to increase difficulty, then I could see these collectibles becoming essential. In its current state though, they're more for fun rather than necessity.StoryThis is not a god-tier or even top-tier story. It's average at best, but it certainly is engaging. Typical trope of using a likeable child character who looks up to you as the protagonist in order to instill a sense of protectiveness. It's cliche, but executed really well. The gameplay complements the story very well, so while the story by itself isn't that good, the overall package is quite stellar.GripesMan I hate silent protagonists.			"

												From what i have played of the game so far (less than 10 hours 1-3 missions) the game is fantastic. the art style is amazing but slightly cartoony. This isnt a bad decision its just there. The combat is difficult and you cant just go swinging your sword around like a beserker and win. The game WILL punish you for trying to be a beserker and murder everyone you see. However if you play it quiet and never hurt anyone but your targets the game will reward you in ways i wont spoil for you. The story is very good but slightly predictable. Your the guardian to a queen her bodyguard infact. After she is murdered and she tells you her last words while dying in your arms the guards and conspirators against you find you you're hauled off to jail to await your fate. Unknown allies rescue you and from there the story really gets going. the game loves exploration and manipulation of the games powers. i never had any sort of gamebreaking glitch or texture glitch or horrible AI experience *Cough Rome 2 TW Cough Cough* the AI if it detects you will really try to hunt you down. My one concern is it seemed a little too easy to sneak past but maybe thats because i was playing on normal difficulty. Game mechanics are solid and no two playthroughs will be the same unless you specifically TRY to make it exactly the same. you have a variety of powers that are oh so fun you mess with and you cant have them all so you have to choose wisely. Overall the games a good buy especially at the current 5$ of the sale. Easily worth the 20 though. If you really love the game then the Game of the year edition takes you a step further with Daud the legendary Dunwall assassin who killed the Empress as your main protagonist and his story for redemption. The game is good and is worth a purchase.			"

												This was a cool game. I love the character design, atleast for the main character. The gameplay, for the most part, is exciting. With all of the abilities and options you have at your disposal, you feel very powerful. Sometimes, though, you can be a little too powerful. I played through for the first time on the hardest difficulty without a hitch. It's possible to play through the whole game without being seen or killing anyone, but that can get kinda tedious. Why have all of these brutal abilities if you can't use them? As the game progressed I got more ruthless and stopped worrying about not being seen or not killing. One gripe I have with this game is the skill point collectibles. Since they are necessary to get more abilities, you constantly have to go out of your way to collect them. The story was good and kept me interested the whole time. The world feels alive.			"

												Well, I recently finished Dishonored and I can honestly say it was one of the best games I played this year! I did a low chaos run; minimal killing, no alarms from the half-way point onwards. Had lots of fun being the ultimate blinking, time-stopping ninja! :DThe story is a little straightforward, leading you on a path of revenge and redemption after being framed for the murder of the Empress. Missions generally revolve around an assassination target that needs to be removed in order to dismantle the new regime that has seized control of the Empire. There are also some missions that take a different approach (Lady Boyle's party was one of my favorite parts of the game).Your skills start small but can be developed to be quite devastating by the end of the game. It reminds me a lot of a Ninja-Bioshock; granting you an array of magic powers which are always at your disposal provided you have sufficient mana vials. Except in Dishonored you won’t be flinging lightning bolts or jets of fire, instead you are armed by much sneakier skills such as a mini-teleport, mind control, time control and the ability to see though walls.The level design is one of the best parts of Dishonored. While they may seem small or linear at first glance, a player who is willing to explore will find many different routes to their objectives. There are also many hidden items to loot, runes and charms to find which will improve your abilities and lore to be read in the form of notes, books and audio logs.I would strongly recommend Dishonored to the type of player who loves to explore a world, peeling back the layers and really getting absorbed into the experience. While you could play the game by running directly to the objective and killing everyone in your path, I feel you would be robbing yourself of so much more game that is being offered here. "

													This game is by far one of the best games I have played in a long time. With innovative mechanics and game play it leaves you with a lasting feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction. The art style adds perfectly to the bleak and dreary city of Dunwal and allows that game to look, and play amazingly years down the road. The musical score as well as the strong audio effects bring this whole city to life, from the wailing of the sirens to the skitter of infested rats, This is a game that you absolutely need a good pair of headphones. 	Overall I would give this game a 10/10, I recommend it to anyone that likes a little stealth knife play, or overt gunplay. This game is a must buy.  "

												This game. Holy cow. What can I say about this game? It's hard to know where to start. I love stealth games but I think this is the first time I had one draw me in to this degree. It didn't take me long to get hooked. Of course I enjoyed the gameplay itself. Enough that I played it through in it's entirety twice. I really, really urge anyone playing for the first time to go for the High Chaos play first. It gives more impact to the Low Chaos play. And believe me, if you get as invested as I did, once you get the High Chaos end you're going to want that Low Chaos end. Can the Low Chaos play be frustrating? Absolutely. I put nearly 40 hours overall into this game, getting all three endings. (Yes. There's a third. It's considered worse than the High Chaos end. But you'll have to figure out how to get that yourself. No spoilers here. Though if you're paying attention it shouldn't be too hard to discern where the choice is that'll get you the third ending.) I feel like it has a strong story, good characters and manages to be fun despite being frustrating at times. I even managed to find Emily likable enough, when usually child characters are played up in a way that's somewhat annoying at the very least. I absolutely recommend this game. That said, if stealth games aren't your thing you probably won't enjoy everything this has to offer and might find certain aspects of the Low Chaos run very tedious or frustrating. I, personally, enjoyed this game immensely and look forward to it's sequel!			"

I just wanted to add that even if you're new to the sneaky stealthy genre this game is maybe for just about everyone. I'd give it an easy 5/5 for playability, story, graphics, action/puzzle ratio, REplayability, the DLC, everything. The trailer is good but still doesn't even really do the game justice. Now that it's on sale I highly HIGHLY recommend getting it. Not a game to be missed rspecially with a sequel on the way.			"

												I can't believe I forgot to review this game, played it through a few times already.Love the stealth on this game, it's got stealth, swords, guns, the story is great, the gameplay is pretty good, not going to say it's groundbreaking or anything, you care about some of the characters, not all of them, you probably would have enjoyed more time with the queen and feeling bad she dies, but sadly she goes quickly in the beginning, might have wanted to work up to that, to really drive home the purpose of what you're about to do.Overall great game, good graphics, good gameplay, good story.  Good maps, many different ways to complete a mission, it's not an open world mind you, but it's not completely linear either.Can't wait for Dishonored 2.  hopefully they've made some improvements.

												Dishonored is a well paced stealth game in which you play ""Corvo"" an assassin on the run. This game uses a unique graphical style that adds color to every environment. It also utilises great sound effects to add atmosphere to the stealth aspect of the game. The real thing that holds this game up is its gameplay; during the game you unlock many powers which add new gameplay elements and new ways to approach a scenario. However this game is let down by the fact that it becomes a little repetitive and is far too short. All in all a pretty good game with a few flaws; I'd reccomend this game if you enjoy stealth games.			"

												Dishonored feels like Bioshock meets Hitman: Absolution with a mix of Assassin's Creed and a pinch of Darkness 2. The gameplay is very enjoyable and offers a multitude of play styles to suit your individual taste. The basic climbing aspects combined with the Blink power makes for some fluid and easy movements in the vertical space.The graphics really didn't inspire me to say wow, but they did fit the dark plague theme. It was also hard to understand the timeline between the plague (past) and available technology (futuristic). I also didn't really grasp the supernatural storyline at all so that aspect left me confused, but the revenge storyline was highly enjoyable. Although I always found it weird that a couple of drunk alcoholics kept barking orders at me to kill people while they got to sit in their cozy little bar and drink all day.Unfortunately there was too much reading--I ended up skipping most of the historical books which I probably would have followed if the passages offered voice overs.Despite the minor imperfections, Dishonored is genuinely a good game. For me, the gameplay is what shined and that is why I would play it again.			"

												Buy this game.  The game is a great stealth/assassination type game with some great weapons/powers to make the whole experience fun and enjoyable.  The story is a little predicatable and some of the characters a little bland and underdeveloped but the narative, enviroments and atmosphere of the game as a whole make for a great experience.SPOILER WARNING:  However with all that being said there were several design choices that to me made no sense and took away from the game experience as a whole.  First off, it isn't until after your first mission/area is completed that you are told that if you kill or just incapacitate the guards\civilians\etc... it makes a difference.  That kind of thing needs to be front and center BEFORE you get the chance to knife the first guy, because that makes a big difference in how I want to approach the game.Secondly, the subtitle for this game should probably read ""I HOPE YOU LIKE A THOUSAND SHADES OF BROWN!!!"".  One of the first powers I took and maxed was a power that let you see all items and enemies in a close proximity to you.  I thought that was awesome, I can discover a lot of hidden objects, see where are all the enemies are, what direction they are facing for stealth take outs and where they are going to set up my next stealth take out.  The problem with this power is that it turns the whole enviroment different shades of brown then highlights all people/enemies as yellow and items as green.  Because this power costs little mana/energy and you can regenerate that little bit it uses there is no penalty for having this on and helping set up awesome stealth kills/take downs.  The problem becomes that the game is brown ALL THE TIME.  You can't enjoy the fantastic enviroments that were made or the design of Dunwall because the game was brown for me half the time.  I think a better option could have been made that didn't result in having a brown screen for most of the game.Lastly, it was incredibly frustrating going through this game and trying to not kill people.  Not because it was hard or anything, but it seems that the game from a control standpoint vastly favoured you trying to kill your targets instead of incapacitating them.  For example, if you get behind someone to make a stealth take down you get several different options.  You can kill them, chocke them(incapacitate them) or just loot them if they have something to be looted.   With killing the target it doesn't seem to matter where you are in relation to your target as long as you are somewhere behind/beside/above them.  However with choking/incapacitating them you have be in a very particular spot and sometimes the action button doesn't show up for second or two, especially when you drop in behind your target or use your movement power to land behind him.  This made it incredibly frustrating at times to try to string together a set of stealth take downs or resulted in being detected by your target.Again those are mostly minor annoyances, the game is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

												NOTE: This review is based of the time I played it on XBOX 360, I realize I only have .6 hours of play on PC.Dishonored is one of those games that comes out and alot of people tend to overlook, and it's sad, since this is probably one of the best games to come out of 2012.The game starts out as you return home as Corvo, Guard to the Empress.  Arriving back, you are then later attacked by a group of unknowns and the Empress is killed in front of you and her daughter, Emily, is taken away.  You are then framed for the murder and dissapearance and are taken away to be executed.  From then on, it's your choice of how you play.  Do you choose to take revenge by killing everyone, or do you take the stealthy route and only bring those who wronged you to justice?Thoughts about PC Port:  The PC version of this game seems to run very well on Max settings, (Running on a Radeon HD 7800 and AMD 8 Core Proccessor @4ghz) with it staying at a consistent 60fps and never seeming to drop.  There is controller support if you do choose to play with one, but I prefer to play with KB+M since it allows for easier access to your weapons with the number keys.Overall, this is a great game, and if you are a fan of stealth games or just looking for a new IP that won't dissapoint, Dishonored is definetly worth the full price.

												Dishonored has to be one of the most under rated games I've ever played. I have to admit that when I first started I wasn't too sure about it, but as the game progressed, it grew on me. If you like fast paced games that blow by you, this game is not for you. The story is intricate and the game play is such that it feels familiar but has something not found in most games. Bethesda left their usual mechanics behind for this one. A rare gem on it's own, with it's borderline steam punk feel, strange soundtrack and slightly repetative but interesting dialogue I have to admit this game is not boring.Not truly an open world game it still has the feel of one, The graphics are different but well done and the characters, are interesting. There is one part of the game, with the risk of a spoiler, that feels a bit disjointed and removed from the rest of the game. That soon passes and the game returns to it's normal flow and feeling. All in all I enjoy playing Dishonored and find it an intelligent and well thought out game with enough action and puzzle solving to keep it interesting to the end.			"

												This game is quite possibly my favorite action/adventure game, period. The stealth tactics combined with the various powers one can aquire adds up to an awesome mix of steampunk/fantasy fueled storyline, with amazing graphics to boot. The use of Unreal Engine 3 by this game was a bold move by Arkane/Bethesda, and I hope to see them produce a second title soon. This game is one of Bethesda's greatest titles, and deserves the recognition that it needs to have.			"

												I can't believe it took me so long to play through this game.  The combat system is superb.  It's frustrating to fail, but you never want to stop chasing the next target.  Don't judge the game within the first 20 minutes of playing.  At least try out the first two missions.  By the time I finished playing my first play through on normal, I realized how many different ways I could've ended the game and that I couldn't just choose between a couple of options at the end of the game to see what could happen.  The replay value is significant and I do expect to be purchasing the DLC.  I recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind violence, not that you have to kill anyone if you don't want to, or everyone if you so choose to do so.  There is so much freedom in this game.  Dishonored is possibly the best title I've seen released from Bethesda, though they never fail to dissapoint and this is a testament to that.  This was such an outlet for pent up aggression.  Good work Bethesda.  I'm glad I purchased the game when it was $60, even if I didn't play it until the summer sale when I saw it at $4.99.  The mechanics are fluid, the artwork is on par with that of far cry 3, perhaps even better in it's 18th century feel.  I love this game.  ""Revenge solves everything""			"

												A wonderful stealth game that rewards you even if you're bad. While it is a stealth game, it can be played as an action game, meaning anyone - no matter skill level - can jump in and have fun. The story culminates in different ways depending on your rating and doing worse at the game doesn't mean you get a bad ending with no thought put into it, it merely means you don't get the most desirable ending. Dishonored is a game any stealth enthusiast should play at least once.			"

Once I stepped out of that starting cell, grabbed that starting sword and looted everything in sight, ""You're out! Cut some throats!"" an imprisioned thug called to me.And so, I went around the city, cutting the throats of Dunwall's Finest, and many others, all in that one unnamed thug's honour. The truth was that that one thug was dishonoured, and by fufilling his wishes of cutting some throats, I brought honour to his family name, whatever it was. "

												Bioshock meets Deus Ex with a splash of Half Life 2.  I've just played about 8 straight hours and I am enthralled.  Some sincere spooky moments and great fighting / sneaking bottlenecks where you must choose 1 way or the other and live with the result.  Got goosebumps twice in one night, and I usually hate horror flicks for their lack of true weird spookiness.  1 personal negative that all players including me get used to quickly:  the right mouse fires the left weapon and vice versa.  10/10 will play again until I finish.

												Amazing; The basic idea of Dishonored is freedom. Every level is lovingly crafted to present a variety of options, and the game's mechanics are perfectly tuned to present you with even more ways to accomplish goals, ones that the developers could never have foreseen. The characters are not particularly beatiful, but the art succeeds in creating the desired atmosphere.You can explore the world, or rush straight through to your goal. You can kill everyone in sight, only your targets, or literally no-one. You can teleport around a guard, stab him, shoot him, feed him to the rats ...It is like Thief where you can hold your ground in a fight, or like an action game where you do not have to fight at all. Moment-to-moment gameplay is smooth and well-executed, whether you are sneaking or fighting.This game's fame is well deserved.			"

												It's a very well done game. Graphics are disappointing, but the art/level design is very redeeming. The pc version plays well. Feels kind of like a mix between Half Life 2, Bioshock, and Deux Ex... with some Skyrim and Assassin's Creed sprinkled on top. The game does tend to favor a stealthier approach but there are always a multitude of ways to accomplish your goals, with interesting moral choices. And like a true Bethesda or Arkane game it is designed to be played through multiple times. Highly recommended.			"

												Dishonored is the Badass  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of Theif and Bioshock. A complex, detailed, living and nonlinear world where nearly every action has a consequence. Upgrade the powers and equipment of you choosing, using them to kill everone, or kill noone. No two playthoughs will be exactly alike. For example, playing while relying primarily on stealth and choosing non lethal options on missions, will not only have different affect on the story's progression as opposed to a violent playthough, but it essentially plays like a different game.

												Dishonored feels like it was developed in an alternate universe in which Gears of War (and other games of that ilk) never existed. No brown/grey filter, no snapping to cover, and it's over ten hours long with no multiplayer whatsoever and no fully open world (though the levels are pretty nonlinear). It's a stealth game in which stealth is the only viable option--it's borderline impossible to rambo through it even on the easiest difficulty setting. This is a game that wasn't focus grouped to death; it feels like the developers had a clear vision of what they wished to accomplish and made few (if any) substantive compromises.One will not find bombastic setpieces here, just clever level design clad in a gorgeous, clean art style backed up by fantastic sound design. The structure is reminiscent of Assassin's Creed 1 (a game I loved) in that each mission goes through planning, infiltration, execution, and escape stages, which is something I'd love to see more of in games. The story itself isn't amazing, but the dialogue and characterization are wonderfully written. Everything comes together to create one of the most wonderful and well-rounded games I've played so far this year.			"

												Now THIS is a game.When I purchased Dishonored, I was pretty sceptical about everything - I believed it was just gonna be a mix of AC and Elder Scrolls involving mindless violence. However, when I started playing it properly, I really began to appreciate how brilliant the game really is. The art style is amazing, as is the voice acting and animation style. All three help you get immersed even more in the game, and effectively too.The gameplay is also stunning, with the choices you make (I refer to the fact that you can complete the game without killing ANYONE) effecting the outcome and storyline greatly. The combat system is much better, much more challenging and much more precise than I expected, and is one of my favourite features of the game. The game overall is quite challenging, making you think about your every step before you take it, and at the same time it's extremely enjoyable. Dishonored is now probably one of my favourite games, and I strongly recommend buying it. It's well worth the money.			"

												This is game is one of those REAL STEALTH GAMES, meaning there's actually a need to sneak, not like that other assassin game :P This game requires a lot of patientce, although you could finish the game within a day, you'd be missing out on the back story of things. Pay attention to details, for they also add color to the picture. Lot's of books and notes around here, pretty weird stuff but quite interesting.This game is just one of those games where you can be really creative with your approach to situations, sometimes you could even get carried away with the many things you can do within the game. Pretty good mechanics, lots of stuff around. Players looking for a challenge can go try playing the game with just the blink ability and finish the game without acquiring other abilities and/or enhancement.The only downside to this game for me is that it doesn't include a variety of graphics settings, you'd have to tweak things in the ini file and add better AA via your video driver. But doing those things is just a one time task and you'll be enjoying the rest of the game without them jaggies :PAll-in-all a really great game which definitely deserves the title Game of the Year :D			"

												So I just finished this game. I have to say - I absolutely loved the story, the setting, and the way your choices affected the way events played out. The game itself is played as a relatively short series of relatively long missions. Along the way, there's many things to collect that can easily be missed - bone charms that disappear if you don't nab them at a certain point, changing audio logs of NPCs and fleeting conversations. The former can be a bit frustrating, but the latter is always fun to collect, and illustrates the characters around you nicely. The powers were quite fun to use, and the game provided many, many ways to proceed on missions; things were never impossible, but having a certain ability would often open up a path. My largest complaint, however, would be that the game hands you a wide arsenal of killing tools and powers and then heavily discourages using them. The game has, basically, two paths; low chaos (nonlethal, stealth) and high chaos (lethal). There's a third tier, very high chaos, which is for the most part the same as high chaos, but nets even worse reactions from your allies (at this point, your Corvo Attano is pretty much murdering everyone he sees for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.) High chaos is easier to do at the beginning, because you don't have many powers yet, and the early missions take place in populated areas - but as the game progresses, high chaos creates more enemies, worse situations, crueller allies, and darker endings. It's understandable and rationalized from a story perspective - more bodies means more rats means more plague, and your allies follow the example you make - but given how much gamers are used to killing the bad guys being a core part of games - well, expect to spend some time adjusting with Dishonored, unless you want to see cute little Emily devolve into a tyrant. Also, if you're playing stealthy, which you should be - well, expect a lot of save scumming. When I played, I was saving on average of once every two minutes, sometimes even more often.			"

												I loved this game and it is very fun to play! I give it 5 Of 5 Stars. This game should get more players. There is still one Add-On I have not played yet and i hope it is good! I very much enjoyed the Add-On ""The Knife Of Dunwall"" it is awesome because you get to play as the enemy of the game. So I suggest playing this game it is very fun and you will enjoy it.			"

												A very unique game with a steamPunk(Or WhalePunk more so)Vibe so it.Featuring varied ways of combat and traversing levels from running atop victorian-esque houses to skulking below guards in dingy sewers with them none the wiser.The gameplay benefits from a varied range of powers at your dispoal such as Blink,a power making you capable of swiftly teleporting forth to traverse the envrioment or swiftly dispatch a guard with a sneaky neck slice.The real star of the game is the Stealth aspect though lacking in some aspects(Non-lethal options such as weapons are generally lacking),there are so many ways to go about the levels as each area is multi-leveled with plenty of dilapidated houses which hint at a life gone past.The only real let-down is the story that is somewhat generic,you're the meperess's guard that gets framed for her murder(Hence the title dishonored)You then must go and clear your name which involves 'dealing' which various people of importance which opens up the question;Will you decapitate them in a bloody display of utter brutality or will you dispatch them with a well thought out non-lethal way?The length of the game is about 11-14 hours depending on if you choose to be a ghost unseen by the enemy or a menacing murderer(The latter usually cuts the game down to about 6-8 hours).I spent around 40+ hours on the game as i played it on Xbox 360 first and did a non-lethal,Lethal and ghost(No detection or kills) playthrough.I would highly recommend the game as it's a gem in an endless sea of generic FPS and MMOs,especially if your a fan of Deus Ex and Bioshock.

												I enjoyed playing Dishonored, the story is good and you actually kinda care for saving Emily and getting some revenge for Corvo (the main character) so that means that they did something right. The gameplay is enjoyable with all the skills and such that you can use.The chaos system...well if im one for having consequences in video games, this system is way too strict specially because it will be kinda hard for new players to stealth missions and the choices you make during those same missions affect more than in other games, including the ending you get and the way people react to you, but sometimes its just too strict.Anyways, it was a good experience all in all, and the DLCs are also great specially because you see the story from another POV, a very interesting one.8,5/10.

												Easily one of my favorite games ever. The world is indescribably unique and has a huge amount of character, far from a generic ""dark steampunk"" setting. Though the story is relatively short and the plot twist aren't hard to see coming, the characters themselves are a treat, with some very memorable faces. The Outsider in particular I think will survive in gaming memory for quite some time. And this isn't to say anything about the gameplay, which is incredibly smooth, intuitive, and engaging. It seems like there's dozens of ways to get through any given level, and though the game only has three endings, your choices affect the enemies, so it still feels like every kill-or-spare decision matters. There's never a down moment in this game. It never drags, and there are never places where you become complacent because you've learned all the enemies' tricks. It's the perfect pace and the perfect length for the gameplay it offers. 10/10, would definitely recommend, especially with the sequel coming out this year.			"

												I don't know why I own so many action stealth games when I'm bad at stealth games. Regardless, this one will mold you if you let it. Once you're tired of dying to groups of enemies that make you look like a chump on loser steroids, you'll try the stealth route.Or don't, and just make the rest of us look bad with your amazing skills.Ahem - start this game as someone who couldn't stealth past a corpse while walking behind a sound proof brick wall and end the game as the assassin master you were originally supposed to be.The story is interesting, and it's one of the few games where talking to people doesn't become incredibly tedious. I actually ended up afraid of missing things that people might have said and spent stupidly long amounts of time trying to get them to say new things.The story is rich, even if the twists are a bit obvious, but it's not really about the story - is it?

												I like stealth games, so I decided to give Dishonored a go. It is fairly good, but who wouldn't expect that from the same guys who made Arx Fatalis?The story is compelling. I'll try and spell this out for you while forgoing the spoilers. You're Corvo, an agent and bodyguard of the Empress, but something terrible happens and you're to blame, stripped of all honorable titles. You must, with the help of some friends, stealthily take down or kill your way through the people who've set you up as the fall guy.The gameplay is simple and probably deceptively so. Basically, you're given the an objective, such as, ""Get from point A to point B and eliminate this target."" You'll encounter enemies along the way and you will have to decided to either kill them, eliminate them non-leathally or just sneak past.To aid you in your quests you're given tools of magically fast loading flintlock pistols and crossbows, a sword and some special abilities. These special abilities will help you either sneak or kill. The most important is probably ""blink."" It's sort of like a teleport, but it's not instantaneous and enemies can see you if you blink in front of them. You can also stop time, possess people and animals, the obligatory ""reveal all enemies and obsticles for a short period of time"" stealth game ability and some other cool stuff. The soundwork is pretty good. Nice, crunchy dissonant orchestral work juxtaposed with some beautiful stuff. My only complaint is that there was one point where there were some fireworks and the sound actually clipped. I hadn't experienced that in a AAA title for... in recent memory. It's not that big of a deal though.The level design is great, as it should be. Stealth games rely on good level design and this one doesn't pull any punches. Almost every enemy encounter is a puzzle in itself with more than a few solutions =)All in all, I'd say I'm pretty happy with Dishonored. I haven't played the DLC, but I'll get into that later.			"

												Dishonored is my all time favorite game to date.It's gameplay is superb, with in-game decisions allowing numerous unique playstyles. The story is engaging, if not entirely unpredictable, and the morality system of the game has just enough effect on that story to give the feeling that your choices are impacting the world as a whole. Graphically, the game is incredibly stylistic, and, while it's texture resolutions or polygon counts might be subpar by todays standards, it achieves beauty without dropping it below 60 frames per second on my lower-end PC.

I had no idea what kind of game it was & pleasantly surprised to find out that it was made by former Thief developers. It's a stealth action FPS with magical elements! Pretty cool! Then as I played I found out that how I played influenced the gameworld & in the end its ending. Awesome! Then I picked up the GOTY version to play all the DLCs, and what can I say, the story DLC are even better than the main game! Get this game (the GOTY version is the one you need!)			"

												Rating: 8/10I definitely recommend this game to anybody who's into Medieval Stealth based games. Also any Thief fans would simply love this game, as it brings on Nostalgic feelings of playing Thief back in the day. It also has an action similar to the 'sweep' power named 'blink' While the blink teleportation power may be hard to master and use, it definitely makes the game much more fun to explore with!This game could also be reccommended to any Bethesda Fans, as it's a game of excellent quality which is what Bethesda Softworks is known for! Definitely a Stealth/RPG/Action game that will keep you playing for hours on end!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ratings:(Graphics: 6.5/10) They aren't superb, but they're just right for the animation style Bethesda was going for!(Controls: 5.5/10) The Controls are easy enough to use, maybe a little rigid without a controller.(Gameplay: 8/10) The Gameplay is extremely immersive, the game makes you feel like you're actually the Protagonist!(Storytelling: 9/10) The story really makes you want to beat the game and defeat the Antagonist, it's powerful.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Overall: 8/10)This game definitely gets a spot on my Top 10 Favorite games of all time. Probably one of the most engaging games Bethesda Softworks has put out there. With a spectacular story and thrilling gameplay, this is absolutely a game you need to try out!			"

												Dishonored would have to be one of the very games in his genre, surpassing any others such as Assassin's Creed in my opinion. The setting of the game (a strange industrial era London type design) and sound/music builds an deep atmosphere in the game creating some truly beautiful moments. The story was impressive although not as grand as many other games out there but still worthy of praise. The gameplay itself was what made this game one of the more enjoyable ones I've played for a while. Once you figure out the initial controls it's relatively easy to learn more advanced tactics. Your ""supernatural powers"" can make each playthrough vastly different depending on what you decide to upgrade, whether you go for more stealth based abilities or offensive ones. The idea of having both lethal and non-lethal ways of killing both your targets and standard enemies adds a large variety to each mission, coupled with each mission have multiple ways to complete it allows you to replay it again and again without it losing it's touch. Having difference endings based upon how much ""chaos"" you caused was another nice feature in the game. It also has an effect on the next mission making how you plan out your course of action very important (more chaos equals a more dangerous city). Overall a brilliant game that beat my expectations at every turn. Buy it as soon as you can!			"

												This game is simply amazing! The stealth mechanics in it are so satisfyingly simple and easy to follow. It adds an extra layer of excitement and intensity when you play a no kill, never seen run, and the different weapons and magic abilities you can get in it  can tailor to any play style. Whether you are planning to run into a room to kill everyone with rats and grenades, or just planning to stop time and hit them all with sleep darts, this game falls nothing short of making you feel like a stealthy ninja assassin, or a completely indestructible god to be feared. All in all the game will be short if you run and gun, but the vast replay ability and opposite routes to take to assassinate people will make you come back for more. I can not speak for the DLC, however, for i have not played it, but if it is anything like the base game, it will extend the game even further.			"

												It's hard not to recommend this game. Let's start on the good stuff:> A fantastic new IP, with a great backstory and luciously dirty, grim, metallic, steam-punkesque artstyle and visuals that convey the plagued atmosphere of Dunwall excellently. Sort of a mix between Late Victorian London and the Half-life universe. >Despite having a linear story, the game offers many choices in how the missions are conducted - Stealth or Violence, you choose, with different consequences for your actions.>Stealth mechanics are well-implemented, and make you plan your method of negotiating a section, this is the game's strongest point. >Credits Song is great (neat little addition).It does have its flaws:>Depending on the way you play, the game can be very short (>8hrs).>The characters lack emotion and depth, and animations for NPCs are on the stiff and robotic side. >AI can be inconsistent (sometimes you can walk right past them,  sometimes they see you from 100s of feet away). Overall this is a 9/10, a great game that's bold and different, with a great universe that will leave you wanting more.			"

												Definitely a great game, but a few things are holding it back.  The gameplay itself is nearly completely solid, it gives you choices on how to go about things, and you have enough abilities and weapons so that it won't get too repetetive.  The only issues with the gameplay is it's too easy.  I was able to pretty much breeze through it, and even when you're out in the open, straight up fighting enemies, it still isn't that hard.  Also, the dark vision ability completely removes the need to be cautious, and the shadow kill ability completely removes the need to hide bodies, which makes the game even easier.  It's good gameplay, but it just isn't hard enough.The art and lore is really good, but a big problem with this game is the story.  The story itself is fine, but the morality system really ruins what could have been the perfect game about stabbing people.  You can either have fun in this game, or you can not kill anyone and get the ""good ending"", which I'll get to in  the end.  The morality system has no effect on the game aside from the ending, which is basically binary, although there can be slight differences in that binary ending, but nothing too significant.  If you have fun in the game and get the ""bad ending"", what you get is I fitting climatic end to a great game that fits the overarching themes perfectly, and is in general a brilliant ending, even if it isn't really creative.  But...on my second playthrough I got the good ending.  I feel like they had written the story without a moral system first, and then tacked on a good ending at the last minute without any regard to the themes of the story.  The story is fine, but getting the ""good"" ending, and even simply knowing that that ending is canon, ruins the story for me.  It's like if Great Expectations ends with Pip striking gold and making a fortune off working poor miners to death, and he's happy doing this.  It has no regard to any of the themes.  I'd recommend renaming them the ""bad"" ending to the ""good"" ending, and renaming the ""good"" ending to the ""bad"" ending (I realize that's not technically what the game calls them, but that's really what it means).Basically, even though I focused much more on what was bad, it's still really fun, and you should get it.  Just make sure you kill enough people so that the game is fun and the ending is good.			"

Only until later does it happen that you might be able to take a guard head-on, because 6 extra hear what's happening and come to give you a good clobbering. The gameplay is lots of fun, especially during the second playthrough, as then you figure out new ways to beat the guards to death stealthily and kill the target with flair. The story is nothing special, being very linear and and having almost no plot.Overall: 7/10 An old game still feels pretty fresh.			"

												An excellent example of stealth offering multiple routes, interesting characters and incredibly fluid gameplay really make this game shine. Bethesda know's how to pick 'em....er, usually. The game itself is short...if you go guns blazing at least. Otherwise, it'll take a long while to beat. Overall, I can't think of anything negative about it aside from the lack of information about the world. Buy it if possible, you'll get your money's worth, on sale or not.			"

												Short Version: Dishonored is a Stealth-Game with variety and stunning gameplay that has a decent amount of replay potential7.5/10UPDATE: 9/10Reason for update: This game has insane lore and little hidden stories that make you want to read every thing you see in the City of Dunwall and piece everything together!Long Version: Take a seat, grab some snacks, and prepare yourself for an IGN-Youtube style review!Dishonored is primarily a stealth game with the usual concepts provided in stealth-genre games such as variety in how you can playthrough the game, a basketfull of tools to get you through the game with any amount of beautiful slaughter, as well as new mechanics unique to the game. OVERALL GAMEPLAY   Dishonored has generic stealth gameplay, along with the possibility to run through the entire game blasting, burning, serrating, and electrifying everyone you can think of. The missions do not force you to play in one certain style letting you do whatever you please, or just experiment with anyway you see fit.   Although the gameplay doesn't leave you feeling like you need to stay stealthy by putting you defenseless, nor does it make you feel like you are the center of the world (although in the end, you do put an influence on the weather!), but the game itself could use improvements. MECHANICS   Dishonored is unique in one aspect in comparison to the big-name stealth games out there like Metal Gear Solid, Thief, Splinter Cell, and the Batman Arkham Series. Dishonored gives you superpowers. The catch is, you don't even need to use all of them. You could play nearly the entire game without ever using the powers once, you could play the game using every power.  Blink: Allows you to silently move from one location to another location in the distance. Dark Vision: View life, gadgets, riches, and even noise through walls. You can also summon swarms of rats, slow or even stop time, possess people and animals, or blow people away with the wind! You can also modify the world around you, increasing your health, turning people to ashes, jumping higher, and make your enemies miss their shots (because they're scared and weak!) ET CETERA   There's replayability in the sense that you'd want to challenege yourself. The few amount of hours I've played is due to me constantly speedrunning the game in different playstyles.  Dishonored has a morale system that affects the world around you. Want to kill everyone? The consequence? Zombies and rats. Leave everyone alone? Brighter skies, more guilty friends.  Dishonored is a beautiful game and I definitely recommend playing the game before you play the second one coming out  IN 2016 AAUAUAUUUUUUGUGUHHHHHH  Closing Thoughts The game doesn't have enough beautifully built structure to buy while at full price, but it's definitely worth buying during any sale. Even if it's just 10% off.78/100 -TrixxieDesu! of TrixxiePlaysPiano			"

												If you like hacking, slashing, and brutally destroying your foes, this game is for you. If you like sneaking around to gather evidence of your foes misdeeds to bring them down in a way even worse than death, this game was made for you. Use magic powers bestowed upon you by the mythic being, ""The Outsider"" to destroy your enemies and clear your name, once and for all. (So basically it's a pretty cool stealth game where you use super powers.)			"

												I basically enjoyed tackling this stealthily, with the occasional explosion of kill-'em-all violence if I died too many times trying to be stealthy. I think I got a dark ending as a result, but I'm not inclined to replay it, despite the enticements. It's fine, it's good, even, but it's not great. But it does look exactly like a steampunk Half-Life 2, which is something.			"

												I can't believe I forgot to review this game, played it through a few times already.Love the stealth on this game, it's got stealth, swords, guns, the story is great, the gameplay is pretty good, not going to say it's groundbreaking or anything, you care about some of the characters, not all of them, you probably would have enjoyed more time with the queen and feeling bad she dies, but sadly she goes quickly in the beginning, might have wanted to work up to that, to really drive home the purpose of what you're about to do.Overall great game, good graphics, good gameplay, good story.  Good maps, many different ways to complete a mission, it's not an open world mind you, but it's not completely linear either.Can't wait for Dishonored 2.  hopefully they've made some improvements.

												Dishonored tells the story of Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Empire of Isles and ruler of the city of Dunwall. Wrongfully accused of her assassination, Corvo must clear his name and save Emily, daughter to the Empress and heir to the throne. The game tells a dark and gripping tale, and as Corvo you have absolute control over how it ends. Will you be merciful to the people who have wronged you, or will you act as an angel of vengeance and murder all those who dare stand in your way?Dishonored is quite unlike any stealth action game out there. With sprawling levels that reward exploration and thoroughness, great combat mechanics that feel tight as a drum, a beautiful watercolour art style and absolute freedom to go where you want and play how you want, this game is the true heir to such classics as Thief: The Dark Project and Deus Ex.

												Amazingly beautifully visualized! Also the skills you gain and learn are amazing. Sadly, the PC version has some serious complex keybindings and controlls, what makes the game more difficult than it should have been. Also the skills you gain are permanent, so if you buy one, you cant reset it (like Borderlands) and upgrage another skill. This is a great disadvantage when you need an ability in a sidequest, but you have chosen another skill. Sadly, this makes some quests unable to play. So, to sum up, Great visuals and Style (Those Characters :D! Amazing!), but the controls and Flow in the game could have been slightly less complex, making this game playable for all audiences.			"

The stealth based gameplay is great  in this game but it also allows you to get in situations your own way. You can play stealthy the whole game or you can play all out rambo. Doing either of these two will lead to the outcome of the people and their city at the end of the game.

												The verticality of the gameplay is awesome - I was still finding rooms, corridors, and basements after having played through several times.  You can specialize your powers for stealth or aggression, and you can choose how deeply you immerse yourself in the world: focus just on the mission objectives, or take the time to find and read the books, letters, notes, and the Heart's commentary that flesh it out into something that obviously took a lot of thought.  It's tropey and reminds me a bit of a fairy tale in terms of narrative, but all in a way that's fun rather than boring and an homage to the genre.My main dissatisfaction is with the changes made between difficulty levels.  I had hoped that more enemies, or at least new patrol paths, would appear on the greatest difficulty, but the only thing that changes is the enemies' perceptiveness.  When you already know who is where and when, the difficulty doesn't actually change that much.			"

While sometimes the AI can get a little bit hard to deal with, as in sometimes one guard may see you, but the others won´t, and some of the Upgrades and Powers only apply to a certain playstyle, it´s still amazing.

												NOTE: This review is based of the time I played it on XBOX 360, I realize I only have .6 hours of play on PC.Dishonored is one of those games that comes out and alot of people tend to overlook, and it's sad, since this is probably one of the best games to come out of 2012.The game starts out as you return home as Corvo, Guard to the Empress.  Arriving back, you are then later attacked by a group of unknowns and the Empress is killed in front of you and her daughter, Emily, is taken away.  You are then framed for the murder and dissapearance and are taken away to be executed.  From then on, it's your choice of how you play.  Do you choose to take revenge by killing everyone, or do you take the stealthy route and only bring those who wronged you to justice?Thoughts about PC Port:  The PC version of this game seems to run very well on Max settings, (Running on a Radeon HD 7800 and AMD 8 Core Proccessor @4ghz) with it staying at a consistent 60fps and never seeming to drop.  There is controller support if you do choose to play with one, but I prefer to play with KB+M since it allows for easier access to your weapons with the number keys.Overall, this is a great game, and if you are a fan of stealth games or just looking for a new IP that won't dissapoint, Dishonored is definetly worth the full price.

												The verticality of the gameplay is awesome - I was still finding rooms, corridors, and basements after having played through several times.  You can specialize your powers for stealth or aggression, and you can choose how deeply you immerse yourself in the world: focus just on the mission objectives, or take the time to find and read the books, letters, notes, and the Heart's commentary that flesh it out into something that obviously took a lot of thought.  It's tropey and reminds me a bit of a fairy tale in terms of narrative, but all in a way that's fun rather than boring and an homage to the genre.My main dissatisfaction is with the changes made between difficulty levels.  I had hoped that more enemies, or at least new patrol paths, would appear on the greatest difficulty, but the only thing that changes is the enemies' perceptiveness.  When you already know who is where and when, the difficulty doesn't actually change that much.			"

												Imagine Hitman Absolution and Half Life 2 had a baby, they'd call it Dishonored.  At 30hrs to complete in full stealth, I wouldn't say it's too short when to get all the achievements you have to go stealthy at least once.  It's only too short because it's one of the best single player games of this generation.   Having only done a stealth playthrough I can't say it does anything wrong so far, in fact it does many things right in my opinion they outshine any complaints.  If I had to pick one thing it's the scripted AI ,   like many other stealth games too.  But this one has quicksaves. If you liked Hitman but want first person and supernatural powers, get this one.  I can't wait for the DLC.			"

												My name is Corvo and I am an assassin.Have you ever wanted to play an assassin's creed game in first person or good theif game or hybrid of them. This is the game for you. Developed by Arcane studios (the guys who made the great game Dark Messiah) comes 'Dishonored' a stealth and action game hybrid.The story is alright. You play as Corvo, the empress's body gaurd who has just returned home after a long business trip. Things go awry quickly as group of assailants kill the empress and you get framed for the murder. On your quest for revenge against those who framed you will join a variety of characters to asist in hunting down those responsible for the crime.The gameplay is where this game trully shines. Basically you have missions to complete. Each mission sets you in small area to complete your objectives. You have both primary and secondary objectives. Primary objectives generally involves eliminating a target (lethal or non-lethally) or stealling/tamper with something. Secondary objectives are basically your side quests (which you may find in the map area) and are somewhat similar to primary objectives except it doesn't move the plot that much and you get a special reward for completing them (e.g. money, bone charm etc).You start off with the basic blade and pistol, holding range weapons /spells on the left and your melee weapon on the right. You can't buy any new weapons in the game (you may find some during the game though), but in between missions you can upgrade damage of your weapons, ammo capacity and armor which all costs money. You can also buy grenades to help take out blobs of foes. The final piece to your arsenal are magic powers. You start of with the blink ability (the most useful one), which allows you to quickly dash torwards the targeted location. Using magic powers drains your magic bar, which takes time to regnerate. Each spell cost a certain amount of magic to use, so it's important to learn them before using them in tough situations. As you play you may find objects which allow you to learn new spells (such as rat swarm) or upgrade existing ones. Furthermore, there are equipable items called 'bone charms' which gives you a certain perk (e.g.better powers, quicker movement etc).You can approach the missions in 3 ways: kill everyone, knock out people or don't kill anyone at all (you can mix them up if you wish). Furthermore, you can choose to use only range/melee/spells through out the whole game. As such you can play this as a thief, assassin, mage, shooter or mix of all of them. This open ended gameplay allows you to play the  game your way and add alot of freedom for the player. You face a variety of foes including gaurds, dogs, assassins, plants, each having a unique attack and reaction to the player. there are different endings depending on how you play the game.The map design is superb. Most of the time you have variety of ways to approach the target. Buildings have multiple windows to climb through as well as front and back doors to access. Sometimes there may also be tunnels available as well. Within the buldings there are plenty of furniture and items to hide behind and rooms to hide in as well.Audio adds to the atmosphere of the game. Quite and ambient music is played while your sneaking around, while in contrast to being spotted by foes a more fast pace track is played to add to the tensity of the situation. Also a feature I like is that when you are spotted by a gaurd, an alarm sound plays which allows you to quickly hide from sight or blink away. Weapon noises sound great easpecially gun shots.I highly reommend this game to people who want to experience a first person stealth action game that is all about choice.			"

												Finally got round to playing this game after picking it up for 4.99 a year ago! There's three things I really like about it:1. The playability. Movement is smooth and controls intuitive. And you can make lots of customisations to the user interface to make it play exactly as you like it.2. The steam achievements. There's loads of them and they make you do things in the game you wouldn't normally think about. Adds a layer of depth.3. Stealth versus lethal. And the combination of weapons and powers. Being able to play the game as you want to in your own style and not be penalised for it, instead it simply changes the story slightly. Genius.I can see why it scored over 90 in the metacritic score. Excellent game and well worth the fiver!			"

												Great game, spent 200 h on it and still not enough. Try play different ways, sneak around or kill everything in your way. Find different paths to the target, sometimes in water, sometimes on the roof. The battle system is great, and the magics are awesome. DLCs forced player to get familiar with every skill, even when you didn't use it in your main playthrough. The knife oif Dunwall and Brigmore wiches offered player a different view of Dunwall city, and made Daud, one of the most tough enemies in the main game, alive. Now all I'm doing is waiting for Dishonored II to come out, if Bethesda and Arkane are planning to make one.			"

In service of that, the level design is also incredible. For these reasons, I see this game as the truer spiritual successor to Deus Ex (even though Human Revolution is quite good).

												What can I possibly say about this game that I don't find in other reviews?One thing you ought to know, this game is very very very easy. Wether you choose to play it as a ghost or as the mystic god of murder, it's not that challanging. Why is that? Simple, your character is absurdly insanely OP. You are not a thief, you are not an assassin, you are basically the grim reaper, death incarnate. You are not immortal, bullets will hurt you, so will falling from high. Yet you are able to stop time, you can teleport to safety should you miss a jump, you can see through walls and even possess living beings to better infiltrate and exfiltrate enemy territory. Nothing can possibly stop you exept the witches in the second DLC, and even those can be handled without too much sweat if you get the jump on them.Yet despite this major flaw, the games has many virtues. The atmosphere is spot on. The visuals are charming and sometimes downright breathtaking. The world is grim, yet colorful and interesting, I just wish there was more of it to explore. The plot is very simple and straightforward, but still serviceable. It's one of the few games where I preferred the bad endings (among three possible outcomes).But the greatest virtue of the game is the level design. These truly feel like places rather then videogame stages and due to your supernatural abilities you can navigate in pretty much anyway you want. Not to mention how good they look.Dunwall is packed full with drunken whalers. And what do we do with the drunken whaler?			"

												This game truly lives up to its title 'game of the year'Dishonored itself is a mixture of stealth and action with supernatural elements to it.The way they present it, is giving the player a free range of ways to execute every mission,for example the mission of  ""golden cat"" you'll have not one not two but   8 different ways to get into the mention.The way the game mashes between combat , stealth, lethal, non lethal and exploration together  is close to masterful, I can say it's the best game Arkane have ever made, they succeed creating a very vivid and in grousing game with mechanical system that works like a charm.The game is build on very sever consciences the chaos system, insures that if you want to be violent  and the path of most bloody resistance, then you're going to run into some curious issues later in the game which may or may not effect your enjoyment, that makes the game somewhat more replayable I have to say.On both DLCs ""The knife of Dunwell and 'Brigmore witches' they did a splendid job and personally, I can't wait for sequel that will be coming around 2015.

												The phrase “stealth mechanic” and/or “stealth mission” probably causes the everyday gamer to shudder. More often than not these are tedious, slow portions of a story which usually highlight the worst in level design, mechanics, and AI shenanigans. What starts off as the ""good intentions"" of a player in trying to properly sneak around ends up with the Rambo'ing of an entire level out of sheer frustration.Not with Dishonored.I've yet to play any stealth based game, including any Metal Gear Solid offering (arguably considered the king of stealth) that supplies the level of fluidity, options, and satisfaction in not being seen or shedding a single drop of blood that Dishonored provides. So much so that any time I had my cover broken, and invariably forced to switch to lethal methods, I felt a sense of responsibility to the spirit of the story to load a previous save and try utilizing different areas of the level or player abilities to successfully get through said portion completely unseen. In any other game I would consider this a complete waste of time, and slightly insane. But like I said, the “cool factor” of the stealth here is so freaking cool that you have to indulge it. The atmosphere, level design, and characters within the game are equally top notch. One thing I really appreciated was the fact that you don't have to suspend your disbelief too hard to get into the role of the main character, as the design decision not to make him talk (or see what he looks like) is absolutely the right one for a game of this nature. Brilliant all around. Can't wait for the sequel.			"

												Dishonored is a great game, and I would truly recommend it. The story is quite enthralling, (however not quite explained completely) and the amount you are able to achieve through this character is very good. The controls can be quite slow at some points, but overall, the controls have a good layout. The abilities you will gain over the period of this game is amazing, with each being necessary for any playthroughs you do. Which brings me to another point. The fact you have a control over the way you complete the game, allows you to have a sense of freedom moving through the multiple areas,whether you go big and loud or quiet and sneaky is completely up to you, as is the way you do that. In conclusion, Dishonored is a great single player game, with well thought out abilities, controls, gameplay, and a deep and somewhat dark storyline. The only cons are the slight lag in movements and that the game may get a bit repetitive if you get stuck at certain points, although, the changing in scenery mainly avoids this problem.Dishonored is truly a great game.

												If you have ever played Mirror's Edge and thought ""Gee this game would be even better if I could sneak by these guys or drop down and assassinate them"" then Dishonored may be the game for you. It nails first person platforming very well.There's a lot of choice in this game, there are many different play styles and an impressive amount of diffrent routes to tackle a mission. It definitely encourages multiple playthroughs.A few downsides are the fact story is pretty meh (you were betrayed, you must take revenge, you must save a little girl, blah blah) it's been done quite a bit.  Also upgraded Blink makes the game FAR too easy, you can honestly miss out on alot of Dishonored's content just by blinking across rooftops. Even if you don't do that, if you're a veteran of the stealth genre, you'll find this game not that challenging in general.But the way it fluidly mashes stealth and platforming more then makes up for it, it's quite the blast to play. Apparently the DLC is pretty good as well. "

												Revenge solves everything in Dishonored.You play as the silent hero Corvo as being tasked with being the protector of the Empress. After an assassination you are framed with the murder of the one you where hired to protect along with the kidnapping of her daughter Emily. A day before you are to be executed you are broken out of prison by conspirators to begin your path to vengenance. Bestowed with powers by the so called Overseer it is up to you to carry out your judgement.The game encourages choice at all times. Carry out destruction and death to your target or be the ghost in the shadows as you hunt your prey, murder or destroy their life it is your choice. The game can be cleared with killing no one, not even you target. A good example is branding a high ranking religious figure as a heretic effectively casting him out ruining his life.The weapons are simple and not complicated Sword, Crossbow, bombs and mines fill your arsenal, however it is where your powers from the void inspire greatness. Being able to teleport, slow-time, see through walls and summon a plague of flesh eating rats encourages experimentation, being able to combine them sweetens the deal.The world of Dishonored is all settled in the city of Dunwall with codex entries fleshing out the world to a massive decree that matches Mass Effect lore. Run down districts with the clear seperation of the exploited poor with the corrupt rich in a steam punk world and breath taking visuals in a semi-open world is well done. Choose how you want to reach your target, sneak past guards on the ground or take to the rooftops and even crawl through the Dunwall sewers. Story changes based on your choices of gameplay, a high death streak cause the plague striking the city to fester causing more plague victims called Weepers to roam  the streets and increase in guard activity. Stealth maintains a calm atmosphere with basic guard duty unaware of your presence.  The game does have that sense of it should be played with stealth being the key as a gun-ho approach can rob you of what the game wants you to do but also the lenght of completetion striking missions from 2 hours to 1 hour doing a reckless approach, this of course robs you of the games merits of exploring its possibilities.The game unfortunately lacks a New Game Plus but hungry players can avail of the DLC expansions which offer more story with an alternate character crucial to the main plot.With nearly 65 hours in this game it is one i am not growing tired of, the story and most of all the world gribs me every time. The ability to Blink as what teleport is called is nothing short of a fantastic gameplay mechanic and its the first power you get after 30 minutes in the game.Choose your own path in Dishonored, cause destruction or stalk your foes from the dark, just remember your choices affect the world around you and how people perceive you.Gameplay lenght. ~20 hours			"

												Dishonored is a truly enjoyable game, in any of its possible gameplay styles.I played all the base game in a stealth style, not killing anybody, trying not to be spoted, using alternatives and sidequests to deal with objectives, etc... and it was really fun. You feel like a true assassin that could start killing everybody any minute, but you simply dont want. The maps are designed very good, so you have the chance to use diferent structures, ways and hideouts to move unnoticed.On the other hand, I played both story DLCs ""The knife of Dunwall"" and ""The Brigmore witches"" full bloody murderer, and it was a ton of fun too. Jumping from one enemy to another, changing weapon, slashing them, then disappearing again. And again maps bring you a lot of oportunities to planify your asault to enemies.The powers are fun for both styles and you have different ways to improve abilities depending on how you want to play.Seriously, the gameplay is really fun.The other aspects of the game are not that important, maybe because you dont need anymore, maybe because they dont shine specially. Sound is ok, graphics are ok (obviously great for its time, nowadays they are not impressive, but anyway it is a pretty game with good graphics), story is ok (nothing special, you just want to stealth/murder, but hearing a story meanwhile is nice), collectibles are ok. Nothing really shines aside from the gameplay, but that is not a problem at all.Talking about the DLCs, I think the three of them are great. The 2 that have story are very interesting, as they show another side of the story, what happens to other character at the same time Corvo's story developes. And if you find the game fun, these DLCs will be fun too, since it is more of the same, just with minimal changes. The other DLC, ""Dunwall City Trials"", is fun too. Some challenges to play with the powers and murder abilities, it is interesting to play, and may entertain you a lot if you are a completionist. I didnt spend much time with the challenges (completed all of them some times, spent 3-4 hours or so with it), but anyway I recommend it, since I had a fun time completing the challenges. They are well designed in my opinion.So, if you fancy the idea of being a ninja, a silent assassin whose victims dont notice until they are dead, or a bloodthirsty beast that enjoy fast assassination, this is your game.

												Dishonored is a well paced stealth game in which you play ""Corvo"" an assassin on the run. This game uses a unique graphical style that adds color to every environment. It also utilises great sound effects to add atmosphere to the stealth aspect of the game. The real thing that holds this game up is its gameplay; during the game you unlock many powers which add new gameplay elements and new ways to approach a scenario. However this game is let down by the fact that it becomes a little repetitive and is far too short. All in all a pretty good game with a few flaws; I'd reccomend this game if you enjoy stealth games.			"

Unlike most other games that just sell an incomplete experience and force you to buy the DLC because of that.			"

												Dishonored tells the story of Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Empire of Isles and ruler of the city of Dunwall. Wrongfully accused of her assassination, Corvo must clear his name and save Emily, daughter to the Empress and heir to the throne. The game tells a dark and gripping tale, and as Corvo you have absolute control over how it ends. Will you be merciful to the people who have wronged you, or will you act as an angel of vengeance and murder all those who dare stand in your way?Dishonored is quite unlike any stealth action game out there. With sprawling levels that reward exploration and thoroughness, great combat mechanics that feel tight as a drum, a beautiful watercolour art style and absolute freedom to go where you want and play how you want, this game is the true heir to such classics as Thief: The Dark Project and Deus Ex.

Dishonored, worth buyingOverall impressionIt is not the most beautiful game when it comes to visuals. But the (various) storylines make it a very interesting and well-thought-out gaming experience. I have finished the main game and the DLC's now and I can honestly say that I am looking forward to my next play-through and find out more about the various options and search for all those things I have missed. The game is well-balanced. If you like to use your brain and stealth, this game offers you a nice challenge. If you prefer the more ruthless approach; go hogwild!  Player advice:Save early, save often.Bugs: No major problems encountered.Could be better: I would have liked to see that Corvo had a little more personality. His story is 'okay' but he lacks a voice (literally) unlike Daud who does have a voice and several 'inner dialogues' that make you feel closer to the protagonist.			"

THE GOOD-Cool and useful powers for the player to use-Multiple playthrough options and strategies-RPG-lite leveling of skills and inventory to make Corvo a better assassin-Environments are amazing, and a joy to explore-Music is foreboding, and the atmosphere is dripping with styleTHE BAD-The guards repeat a lot of their dialogue throughout the game. It's kind of charming, in a way.-Not the most difficult stealth gameplay once you get used to the game's features, but it soon becomes a challenge of how to use your skills to maximum effect.I highly recommend this game! Especially worth checking out if it goes on sale. The Daud DLC is very interesting, and shows a lot more of the city of Dunwall and the plots surrounding Corvo.			"

												A very in depth game with a plauge ridden Victorian Steampunk meets black magic theam.  Combat is smooth with a great Skill selection system and many great finishing moves that make the game a joy to play.  The use of the unreal engine means that the opponents are tough and tactically aware to a point.  Jump into a fight and you will quickly find yourself surrounded and dead.  The Steath system is well thought out with amazing abilities and many ways to ither sneak past opponents/obstructions, take them down from a distance or sneak up on them to deal with them personally.  Challenging yet fun, the use of achievements and your actions in the past dictating the game progression make the game worth playing over and over again.  The Download content and challenge runs are a fantastic way to hone your skills and play the game in ways one otherwise would not.			"

												Set in a very interesting world where your actions affect the outcome of the story - one can choose to assassinate everyone and everything or simply subdue the enemy and complete each mission with non-lethal means of action. Dishonored was most enjoyable because of the freedom one had in the process of completing the game, if you aren't much of an explorer you can choose to complete the game in a matter of a few hours simply by doing just the necessary missions that follow the main storyline but you're also able to sweep every corner of every map, thoroughly, to find all the coins (used to buy upgrades and consumables), runes (used to learn different abilities, such as increased running speed, teleportation etc.) and bone charms (used as small perks), should you wish to.If you're an experienced firstperson PC-gamer you can have a lot of fun playing around in this game, even at the harder difficulties - the more skilled and faster you are, the more of an advantage you've got on the world around you.Interesting story, interesting gameplay and very interesting characters - recommended for any stealth/assassin enthusiast as well as the casual murderer.

												There's something really special about Dishonored. I've played games that were more graphically impressive, I've played games that do combat and stealth better, and I've played games with more intriguing stories before. Dishonored, though, has a special SOMETHING, some mystery element, that makes it really shine. You find it easy to overlook graphical glitches in the face of beautifully designed mansions. You can forget how much better the stealth was in Thief when you're flooded with adrenaline from a perfect assasination takedown. There's just a special something that really sets this game apart.For me, the strongest thing Dishonored has going for it is that it's absolutely drenched in atmosphere. Even when the games' central story isn't much more than interesting, the world in which it takes place is absolutely awe-inspiring. It feels like a real world that's existed long before the exploits of Corvo, and will continue to exist long after he's dead.As far as the gameplay goes, the glue that really makes it stick is the wide array of powers that completely change the game. A player with the posession ability is going to approach a mission in a completely different way than someone who's focused on their ability to slow and stop time. As I blinked from rooftop to balcony to rooftop, my silenced boots letting me dash full speed, and dove from immense heights using unsuspecting guards to soften my landing, I realized that Dishonored was one of those rare games that really sells the fact that you ARE exactly as incredible as people will whisper that you are.On top of the extremely solid main game, there are four pieces of DLC available. One is your standard pre-order bonus package, which is fine, but the other three are absolutely worth the money. The Dunwall City Trials is a series of challenges that pit you against enemies, puzzles, and races, and they're worth the price alone. There's also a two-episode story expansion, though, that's especially fun. The Knife of Dunwall and the Brigmore Witches put you in the shoes of Daud, the assassin of the Empress, and allow you to see his side of the story. I won't spoil things here, but the DLC offers moments that rival and surpass the core game, and the blended Blink/Time Stop ability is absolutely amazing: it's a game-changer.I'm they type of person who has no problem going without a sequel. I adore Blade Runner, but I realize it isn't necessary to have a sequel. With the gorgeous, detailed world that Arkane has created here, though, it would be criminal not to explore it some more. The mystical, steampunky, run-down world of Dishonored is one I would revisit in an instant.			"

The people you kill, the people you save, and (most importantly) the person you are, will affect everything and everyone around you...especially those closest to you.  And when you finish the game, and see the world as your actions have made it, you will see what is truly great about Dishonored.			"

												Dishonored is, without a doubt, my favorite stealth game ever. More than Metal Gear and more than Deus Ex. You are Corvo, the royal protector who was framed for the murder of the empress. You must then take your revenge on those who framed you with the help of magic from the Outsider and gadgets from Piero to aid you in your stealthing.One of the main reasons I love this game so much is player choice. My playtime reflects that you can play the game more than once. If you're playing it once you aren't doing it right. At the shortest, you can play the whole game excluding the even shorter DLCs in about ten hours. However, the game offers many ways to play it through multiple times. In this regard, Dishonored is like an RPG. To compare to Fallout, another Bethesda game, my first run in both games is what I would do. In Fallout, I would side with the good guys (mostly) and be mostly nice. In Dishonored, I would use as much magic as I could, get as many runes as possible, not kill many people (murder wasn't out of the question though) and do other things I won't get into for spoilers' sake. I played a female psychopath in Fallout next, and in Dishonored I got all three achiemements for not killing anyone. You can play the whole game without killing anyone and in the sequel, you can do the whole game without magic. Speaking of the magic, it's a great thing to put into a stealth game. In games like Metal Gear, it focuses on raw stealth in which you use distractions and funny looking diving to sneak about. With magic, you augment your sneaking so it becomes easier and more fun. It's optional however, except the first tier of blink. With blink, you can teleport a short distance to reach high places or traverse crowded streets faster. There is also dark vision that lets you see through walls. All of these powers make the game a very fun escape from traditional stealth games. Along with these powers, you get bone charms that add passives. To get this magic you have to collect runes and bone charms. These are often placed off the beaten path and finding them leads you into interesting sidequests and cool lore to find. The game is rich in lore. Books are everywhere and audiologs explain a lot of things. You will learn about the seven scriptures of the overseers and why they name the months like month of nets. These sidequests and alternate pathways are different each time you play. If you seek runes early in the game, someone will ask you to poison a bootleg elixr distillery, and in the very next level, you are recruited by the person you ruined to do something. With a story rich universe and fun mechanics and player choice, Dishonored is a must play for fans of stealth and story.			"

												This is literally the best game I've ever played. (played for many hours on the Xbox 360)The strongest aspects for me are the world and the characters. You can feel the history of the places you visit and the people you encounter. The books and journals you may or may not read all work perfectly together to weave a top notch fantasy setting. The well-voiced dialogue sells every emotion and burden a character has. You'll make friends with these people. There's something new to be discovered every time you play. The only weak point is the music. For the most part, it's bland, emotionless, and repetitive. It doesn't bring the game down but it certainly doesn't lift it up, either. Maybe it could have benifited from being less reliant on cues. For example, every time you discover a secret, the same 10 second clip plays. Over and over again throughout the game. Another incredibly awkward theme plays every time you return to your home base after a mission. Hopefully most people don't even notice it. Other than that one aspect, though, it's a perfect game.EDIT - Upon further review of the music, I've somewhat changed my mind. The two examples I listed above and one other (any time you choose to save a citizen on the streets from a potential threat) are indeed annoying to hear, but they are the minority. There is a LOT of music in the game and the vast majority of it is well done and immersive.EDIT 2 - No, the music sucks. Mostly. Sorry, composer. Still a great♥♥♥♥♥game, though.			"

I'd give it an easy 5/5 for playability, story, graphics, action/puzzle ratio, REplayability, the DLC, everything. The trailer is good but still doesn't even really do the game justice.

												This game is simply amazing! The stealth mechanics in it are so satisfyingly simple and easy to follow. It adds an extra layer of excitement and intensity when you play a no kill, never seen run, and the different weapons and magic abilities you can get in it  can tailor to any play style. Whether you are planning to run into a room to kill everyone with rats and grenades, or just planning to stop time and hit them all with sleep darts, this game falls nothing short of making you feel like a stealthy ninja assassin, or a completely indestructible god to be feared. All in all the game will be short if you run and gun, but the vast replay ability and opposite routes to take to assassinate people will make you come back for more. I can not speak for the DLC, however, for i have not played it, but if it is anything like the base game, it will extend the game even further.			"

												This game gets a lot of hate, which i feel is undeserved. The entertainment I've had from this game is based on the freedom to execute missions in different ways. The only other game that had this feeling for me was the original assassin's creed, but many were put off by the repetitivity of its objectives. I have heard scrutiny over difficulty of the game, but the freedom (in my mind) is in place of difficulty. It is closer to a simulation than most games. If you appreciate casual gaming experiences, violence, stealth, or the ability to tailor games to your liking, you have reason to enjoy this game.			"

												I consider myself to be an open-minded individual and as such, you will rarely (if ever) hear me say that you're playing a game ""wrong."" But as tasteless as it sounds, I'm willing to make an exception for Arkane Studio's Dishonored. There is indeed, in my humble opinion, a wrong way to play this game.Dishonored is a tale about revenge. The player assumes the role of Corvo Attano, the bodyguard of an empress presiding over the fictional city of Dunwall. Upon returning from a long trip, Corvo finds himself caught in a conspiracy in which he is framed for the empress’ murder. The plot, which is as generic as they come, follows Corvo as he exonerates himself by removing the corrupt government now in power.Not only is the plot an idea taken from many other works in the medium, but it is also extremely predictable. The mid-game twists can be guessed right from the get-go. Clearly, storytelling is not Arkane's strong suit. As a bit of a forewarning - don't pick up Dishonored if you're expecting anything revolutionary in the way of narrative.On a different note, the atmosphere surrounding the plot is rich and engrossing. If players really take their time to read every book and listen to every audiograph scattered throughout the game, they'll learn that Dunwall has a surprisingly deep and tragic history with even darker times ahead. The world of Dishonored truly feels fleshed out, and if there is one thing I can be sure of, it is that there are more tales to be told.But above all else, the gameplay needs to be thoroughly discussed. It is, after all, what you'll be doing for hours on end, and the core mechanics are what determine the overall quality of the game. Fortunately, Dishonored excels in this area with flying colors. This here is not a linear game devoid of options. Dishonored is an open-ended affair, filled to the brim with gameplay choices. For those who are looking for a title that tailors uniquely to how you want to play, there is no better match than Dishonored.There are only nine missions in the game (making it a very short one--but more on that later), and only eight of which take place in open maps. Each of those maps is extremely well designed, allowing for multiple paths to any one objective. You can take the direct route (bursting through the doors!) or a discrete one (gallivanting on the roofs or through the sewers!). You can even possess a rodent and travel through tiny vents. The possibilities, while not limitless, are certainly abundant.  Which brings me to my next point...Powers! There are a number of collectibles (runes) littered throughout each stage. Collecting grants player points to invest in new powers, of which there are about a dozen. Some of them are passive (such as increased vitality or speed) while others need to be triggered (possession, time bending, teleporting, and summoning swarms of rats to do your bidding). Whether or not you’ll be playing lethally or non-lethally, each ability will come in handy in their own unique ways.With so many ways to approach Dishonored, one might wonder, “How can you play the game ‘wrong’?” The simple answer would be: by playing it only once. With so many options available, you won’t be getting your money’s worth unless you are willing to investigate every avenue. Play through the game without killing or being detected and you’ll feel extremely skillful. Play through the game slaughtering every moving creature and you’ll feast on the stylishly animated kills. If you put Dishonored aside after witnessing only half of what it has to offer, it’ll not only be an affront to the developers, but a tragedy for you.Grade: 4/5			"

On top of that the 2 DLC Blade of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches are fantastic additions to the lore and main story itself. As it stars Daud who is an antagonist within the main campaign.Games mechanics are simple, yet the type of combinations that you can do are quite complex and can lead to some hilarious results.And for those who love to explore maps this game has one of the better designed ones allowing the characters to wander about in the levels trying to find every single bit of loot & coin to help power up ones character, along with the scattered lore which adds to the story of the world you are playing in.

												Assassin's Creed could learn a thing or two from Dishonored!I don't know why it took me this long to play this game but I have to say I quite loved it. I'm not crazy about steampunk-ish art style games or whatever you want to call it, I enjoy them on rare occasions and I definitely enjoyed Dishonored's art style.My very first playthrough I accomplished on the hardest difficulty without killing anyone, never being detected, and not having spent any runes on the magic upgrades. Some say I may have missed out on the ultimate experience but I felt that it was quite unique and still very doable. A silent Batman who never kills, is unseen, and has no superpowers. Yeah, I liked this game.With an A List cast of voice actors including Lena Headey, Chloe Grace Moretz, Susan Sarandon, Michael Madsen, and even Carrie Fischer (Yes, Princess Leia from Star Wars) I have to say this game was a wonderful experience. The characters felt real and alive, your choices had consequences, and you had multiple ways to to go about your assassinations, unlike Assassin's Creed where it guides your hand on how THEY want you to kill someone, in Dishonored you don't feel like a slap on the hand when you decide to take out a target your own way.11/10 Highly recommend it.

												It's rare to find a game that is drawn out completely by hand. The graphics won't wow you, but it's certainly artistic.There's 2 ways to approach this game, run and gun or stealth, I found the latter to be more satisfying. Remember whatever path you choose will lead to its own consequece. Whether you like to run and gun or stealth, the game suits both needs just fine, especially for players who like the stealth genre. This is one of the games that tackle the stealth genres really well. Highly recommended.			"

Its published by Bethesda and developed by Arkane Studios, its a beautiful fleshed out steampunk world designed by the Art Director from Half Life 2. I could describe its gameplay in a nutshell as being an interesting blend between the mechanics of Thief, Bioshock and the Elder Scrolls series.personally i believe its awesome...and a good contender for GOTY :)			"

												9/10 - WHAT a game! Whether you want to be super stealthy or go on an all out rampage during the levels, this game has so many ways of being completed that one playthrough won't ever be enough!I was impressed at the level of detail the game went in to, from the over-arching story to the little snippets of conversation you pick up as you're sneaking past a group of guards. I'd recommend playing hard/hardcore as it might be a little easy towards the end when you are an all-powerful assassin. Two things that stopped me giving it a top score; 1) A few minor glitches that I found a little annoying at some points2) I found myself playing a lot of the levels constantly with dark vision enabled which detracts from the amount of visual detail that this game has.Bought during the steam sale I can't believe the value for money I got here! Would recommend anyone to pay full price as it is AWESOME! Now to go back and find the coins I missed... "

												DishonoredTL;DR - buy it Dishonored Is A (very Reccomendable) Great Steath/ Assassination game set in a perfectly styled run down 1900s style city, though its not an open world the individual mission levels are very large and branching often with multiple levels and ways to reach objectives and various shiny magical collectible things... which i rarely bothered to collect as i was busy focusing on the setting, which is wonderful ( Its a bad place to be , but an interesting place and one whose aesthetic really rung well with me ) =Story    NO SPOILERSYou ( as i am sure you have gathered from various other material you may have read about the game ) play as Corvo (Attano?) the former bodyguard of the empress framed for her murder and trying to help the ""good guys"" ( ie the ones who didnt frame you ) who are trying to find the emperess' daughter and put her on the throne.... i cant really say any more, other than its basically a long revenge plot with exciting twists and turns. The plot is not too long (only 9 missions as far as i can recall), it doesnt outstay its welcome like a ubisoft game... =AtmosphereThe atmosphere is what i really love about this game, its just so.. wordless. The city seems to be like victorian london , with tall, proud brick structures muddied by the smoggy choking industrial (more on whale oil later) city, Dunwall is also very ill, wreaked with a strange and incredibly contagious foreign plague which has turned the place into a very dangerous zone with the city gurads all around and strict quarantines. this contrasts very Starkly to the rich feasts and parties of the titled upper class aristocracy who are ALL bad. Whale oil, this newely discovered potent substance is used in all sorts of cool inventions which cheifly seem to be designed to kill You, runs the whole city, and massive iron gargantuans bring in whole live whales ready to be stripped down and have the oil extracted from their bodies in dirty factories and knackering yards. The religiuos dunwall citizens can pray to the creepy totalitarian ""abbey of the everyman"" whoose ramsey snow lookalike  god (or at least i think so) embues you with special magical killing powers ( such as blink) which really spices up gameplay=GameplayIsnt that well planned out how i got round to gameplay just like that... Well, The Gameplay from Playing this Game is very fun, and thats what mattersa in the end, you basically teleport around from roof to roof occasionally leaping onto an unsuspecting guard, If they realise youre there then they will all go looking for you, while one tells the others that the person who kills the ""masked assassin"" will be given whisky for a week, which, considering I killed so many big people i thought i was slightly higher priority and my killer would at least get maybe.. a ticker tape parade or something.apart from the exciting powers, you also have a cool looking fold up sword (for easy storage i presume), a loud but powerful pistol/shotgun and a more stealthy poison arrow killing wrist crossbow (they must have stollen it from assassins creed or something) which was always running out of ammo, there are a few types of bombs as well, which again, i rarely had any of.=GraphicsHeres a fun fact, dishonored is made in the same engine as The Vanishing of Ethan Carter (another very reccomendable game) but you wouldnt know it, the graphics, arent amazing, with low res textures etc but the overall art direction and aesthetic make up for that, so overall, though it is an old game , that just means it runs at a higher framerate.with my r9270x, i got above 60fps everwhere with all settings turned up to 11 and even some extra AA from catalyst control center=OverallIts well worth £19.99 for the GoT (thats game of the year not game of thrones) edition, tbh its worth £50...

												Halfway in and it has been lots of fun.Don't regret picking it up on sale, actually wish I'd gotten the DLC too.Almost didn't buy it, because people complain about the ""forced"" stealth and chaos system.Currently I play a full chaos playthrough and I don't see, what all the fuss is about.I like this stealth/combat balancing much more than for example in Deus Ex HR, where playing stealthy+nonlethal automatically leads to much more xp/skillpoints - now that's enforcing stealth with hard sanctions.Contrary to that Dishonored mainly changes the ambient mood depending on your style, NPC-bots complain about destructive player actions, the world becomes darker, the more people you kill...I see no problem with that.Basically, if you want to play offensive, you can... honestly, who cares about the story/ending in a game like this?For me this game is not exactly a RPG. It's about having fun with the gameplay action, the sneaking, swordfights, shooting, jumping, spellcasting, climbing, throat slitting, hiding in shadows, exploding things, peeping through keyholes, pickpocketing and so on.Those parts are the real fun, not what type of ending I get.Did anyone play Diablo for the story? I certainly didn't, I played it for the action. And yes, this is not a mere FPS.If you are vastly outnumbered and completely refuse to sneak and hide to get to better vantage points, you will have a hard time - the attack button will not save you in every situation.Still, it gives you lots of liberty how to achieve your objectives.Want to be a merciless assassin, killing pretty much everything that moves? Well go ahead, you can do that, actually the game even accepts(not ""punishes"") this playstyle choice by spawning more enemies, giving you more things to kill.Want to be a good samaritan, not even killing the really evil antagonists, avoiding all offensive confrontations?Well there you go, you can do that too (and it's actually harder than fighting your way through).And anything in between those extremes is possible too.Some aspects I consider negative:- there is no map. Many say none is needed, which is true. But when looking for hidden secrets,loot, passages I'd rather have one.- no new game plus, further playthroughs can't incorporate gained upgrades/skills. I'm ambiguous on this. Good for balancing and replay value with different skill setups, so I see the reason.- difficulty is a bit low for my taste (except in some spots with superior enemies/traps/alarms), definately going to switch to hardest, once I'm more used to the controls.- the mission/map progression is almost 100% linear (variations are minor, mainly whether and in which order you do current side objectives), though most maps offer a lot of freedom of movement and direction, different routes.   You can sidetrack, but only in a limited fashion/timeframe. (I find myself wishing it had an expansive open world like Skyrim - that would be a blast).- minor stuff that feels unintuitive with mouse+keyboard, like Esc not closing certain screens/the zoom view, such things.- though some say the story plot is good, I'd say if you're no kid and had your fair share of TV/books, there ain't much to surpise you.  I can pretty much predict the big twist already without spoilers.  This point doesn't bother me personally though, story is passable enough to not be painfull or silly.Big nostalgia bonus for (adult) Star Wars fans: Carrie Fischer is voice acting :)			"

												So I just finished this game. I have to say - I absolutely loved the story, the setting, and the way your choices affected the way events played out. The game itself is played as a relatively short series of relatively long missions. Along the way, there's many things to collect that can easily be missed - bone charms that disappear if you don't nab them at a certain point, changing audio logs of NPCs and fleeting conversations. The former can be a bit frustrating, but the latter is always fun to collect, and illustrates the characters around you nicely. The powers were quite fun to use, and the game provided many, many ways to proceed on missions; things were never impossible, but having a certain ability would often open up a path. My largest complaint, however, would be that the game hands you a wide arsenal of killing tools and powers and then heavily discourages using them. The game has, basically, two paths; low chaos (nonlethal, stealth) and high chaos (lethal). There's a third tier, very high chaos, which is for the most part the same as high chaos, but nets even worse reactions from your allies (at this point, your Corvo Attano is pretty much murdering everyone he sees for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.) High chaos is easier to do at the beginning, because you don't have many powers yet, and the early missions take place in populated areas - but as the game progresses, high chaos creates more enemies, worse situations, crueller allies, and darker endings. It's understandable and rationalized from a story perspective - more bodies means more rats means more plague, and your allies follow the example you make - but given how much gamers are used to killing the bad guys being a core part of games - well, expect to spend some time adjusting with Dishonored, unless you want to see cute little Emily devolve into a tyrant. Also, if you're playing stealthy, which you should be - well, expect a lot of save scumming. When I played, I was saving on average of once every two minutes, sometimes even more often.			"

												I  really like the game thanks to a few factors. The graphics are slighly cartoonish, which I really like. There are often multiple solutions to solving missions. This is one of the few times I've seen it implemented and it works. Possess guards, rats or dogs and sneak past right under their radar or you can take the straight on violent approach or you can sneak over the rooftops.What could have been better is the story. It sometimes feels a  bit cheesy and ""seen before"".			"

												You get to play as Corvo, a bodyguard turned assassin who gets framed for murder and gets to seek revenge by eliminating targets in a series of missions.  The missions can be completed in a multiple of ways, think the prime focus is to play in stealth but you get to play how you want via stealth, combat or a mixture of both.  Go on a killing spree and kill everyone in sight with a wide variety of weapons and awesome supernatural powers, blow enemies up with whale oil, rewire traps to backfire on them, sneak behide and slit throats or even send a swarm of rats after them, slow time and watch.  You get to hide bodies you kill so not to alert others, dump them in piles and leave for the rats, spell out your name if you want, I made a long human centipede with unconscious bodies it was fun.Or take a totally different route and be stealthy, go undetected and choose to take the nonlethal option on targets and not kill anyone in game.  There really is that much freedom to choose.  All my playthroughs have been played in such a different way it's felt like a totally different game and given alternate endings.The DLC's are worth a look, they have a whole lot of good quality content and offer a heap load more gametime.  Still aint done with the DLC's myself.Could not wait to finish my working day to play this game, made me drive home faster so I could fit in more hours.Very highly recommended, I adore Dishonored			"

												This is one of the better stealth action/adventure games that I have played in a long time. The gameplay and story is linear, but the level design and multiple ways to get to your objective keeps the game from feeling stale. The weapons in the game are so-so. The majority of the time you will be teleporting around and stabbing people in the back with your blade. The only real time you use weapons is when you alert a guard and an entire militia comes after you. The graphics are decent. I am using SweetFX to make the colors more vibrant and add a little more anti-aliasing. The Unreal Engine is not pushed to the limit here. The art direction is similar to Bioshock:Infinite, but with a lot less attention to detail.			"

												Dishonored is a game you absolutely have to own, and play. This game allows you to play Stealth without killing a soul, and still complete any mission. Or you can go ""guns blazing"" and kill anything in sight. You can also mix up both play styles(s); go stealth and kill anyone you see or you can go ""guns blazing"" and when you feel you can't handle all the enemies you can escape and continue the mission undetected, and still complete any mission. The game rewards you for both play style(s). If you're a fan of stealth, then this game has stealth mechanics that are flawless and are really fun to play around with If you're a fan of killing and being the ""apex predator"" then the game has incredible combat mechanics to offerand if you like to mix the two game styles up, you can do so to. (IMPORTANT: The play style(s) you choose impact the ending)Therefor increasing replayability in a whole new level.I suggest playing this game both ways (Non-Lethal and Lethal) to get the full experience.I also recommend the DLC's. Just when you think this game has all, the DLC's come into play and offer a lot more.			"

												A very fun, interesting game that follows in the footsteps of the original Thief series more than Thi4f did.The world you inhabit offers a wide variety of locations from the fantasical to the mundane, the backstory is as intricately detailed as you want it to be (dig and there's always more details to find, ignore most of the details and it won't hurt your game), and the play style is mostly up to you.You can play stealth, you can play rambo, you can play a combination of the two and still find a way through. As the game progresses new gameplay mechanics are introduced to keep everything fresh, but never manages to feel contrived or break the game setting.			"

												Dishonored: Loads of fun (even if it needs some work) 8/10+Movement/controls feel great+Incredibly well designed, non-linear, Hitman (1-Blood Money, not Absolution) style levels+Well written/acted+Great lore to be found!-/+ The AI can be a bit dumb, but if that wasn't the case this game would be near-impossible. You either get immersion breaking moments, or a crappy game.-...well, the levels are non-linear hitman style up until the last 3 or so (also, 2 sewer levels)-not many non-lethal options -only 10 or so hours (I put in 20 because I suck at nonlethal playthroughs)-Despite claiming that you can play your way, the game punishes you if you don't play ITS wayFinal thoughts: Really fun stealth gameplay and lots of potential. I feel that this game deserves a proper sequel, to take this great game, and make it a masterpiece.			"

												You get to play as Corvo, a bodyguard turned assassin who gets framed for murder and gets to seek revenge by eliminating targets in a series of missions.  The missions can be completed in a multiple of ways, think the prime focus is to play in stealth but you get to play how you want via stealth, combat or a mixture of both.  Go on a killing spree and kill everyone in sight with a wide variety of weapons and awesome supernatural powers, blow enemies up with whale oil, rewire traps to backfire on them, sneak behide and slit throats or even send a swarm of rats after them, slow time and watch.  You get to hide bodies you kill so not to alert others, dump them in piles and leave for the rats, spell out your name if you want, I made a long human centipede with unconscious bodies it was fun.Or take a totally different route and be stealthy, go undetected and choose to take the nonlethal option on targets and not kill anyone in game.  There really is that much freedom to choose.  All my playthroughs have been played in such a different way it's felt like a totally different game and given alternate endings.The DLC's are worth a look, they have a whole lot of good quality content and offer a heap load more gametime.  Still aint done with the DLC's myself.Could not wait to finish my working day to play this game, made me drive home faster so I could fit in more hours.Very highly recommended, I adore Dishonored			"

												Bioshock meets Deus Ex with a splash of Half Life 2.  I've just played about 8 straight hours and I am enthralled.  Some sincere spooky moments and great fighting / sneaking bottlenecks where you must choose 1 way or the other and live with the result.  Got goosebumps twice in one night, and I usually hate horror flicks for their lack of true weird spookiness.  1 personal negative that all players including me get used to quickly:  the right mouse fires the left weapon and vice versa.  10/10 will play again until I finish.

												Amazing; The basic idea of Dishonored is freedom. Every level is lovingly crafted to present a variety of options, and the game's mechanics are perfectly tuned to present you with even more ways to accomplish goals, ones that the developers could never have foreseen. The characters are not particularly beatiful, but the art succeeds in creating the desired atmosphere.You can explore the world, or rush straight through to your goal. You can kill everyone in sight, only your targets, or literally no-one. You can teleport around a guard, stab him, shoot him, feed him to the rats ...It is like Thief where you can hold your ground in a fight, or like an action game where you do not have to fight at all. Moment-to-moment gameplay is smooth and well-executed, whether you are sneaking or fighting.This game's fame is well deserved.			"

												This game is great! I played through once with high chaos (killed a lot of people) but when I finished the story (which was a bit short) I found that the game has a replayability value which I did not expect from a campaign-only game. You can play the game over and over again, mixing non-lethal playstyles with lethal ones, all while exploring and using supernatural powers to aid your mission of revenge. I also recommend you read the various books and notes scatered throughout the city to immerse yourself in the lore of Dunwall. I would give this game a 9/10, only because of its disappointingly rushed and short storyline!			"

												This game is for the most part action and stealth.  The main character is assigned targets that he may eliminate in a variety of different but fulfilling methods.  There is an interesting system of chaos.  The chaos will affect the next level.  High chaos makes the game more challenging and low chaos seems to make the game easier.  This system will punish players that chose a direct path rather than the stealthy path.  However, it is still possible to beat the game.  There is also an exploring aspect to each level to collect different items like collectibles.  The completion of each level is displayed when you finish the level.  The games has some rpgish element in the way you upgrade the character.  This game was an overall enjoyment.			"

												Brief review.Story: Epic tale in league with Bioshock Infinite. Simple story richly told. Likable characters. Interesting surprises.Mood: Half Life 2 and accompanying episodes. Moderate anxiety stealth with enhanced sensory awareness and many choices.Mechanic and special powers: reminiscent of Bioshock and inFAMOUS Second Son.Sets: Beautifully designed levels.Powerups: Rare but sufficient powerups dispersed throughout the levels. Health and special powers elixirs.Special powers system: “Powers” that you can select and use with one of your hands as in Bioshock and Skyrim. “Bone Charms” that give you special personal skills as in Fallout 3.Difficulty: Challenging missions, but very doable if you are patient and carefully plan your moves. Few boss fights and they are not crazy hard (on “Normal”).Replay value: High. Many different options, different gameplay styles to decide upon, different routes to take on any given mission. High chaos: many encounters with enemies. Low chaos: avoiding enemies with meticulous planning and stealth.Overall impression: One of the best games in my library. Compelling and immersive story that motivated me the way Bioshock Infinite, Wolfenstein: The New Order, and Half Life 2 did.Final thoughts: With a little modification, this game could have formed a solid foundation for Half Life 3.

It's clearly one of the best releases this year, in fact it's probably the best I played.The setting's amazing too most of the concepts being created by Viktor Antonov from Half Life 2. It's a real pity that the game is incredibly short even if you do every single side-quest. It doesn't take more than 12 hours to finish the game. And that's really the low point for me, in my humble opinion the game is not worth the 60 dollar asking price. But if you can get a good discount you should totally get it			"

												The game itself is your sneak through game, fairly similar to the Agent 47 / Hitman games. You play as Corvo, the right hand of the Empress. Corvo is framed and accused of the Empress' murder, and thrown into a cell and tortured by the real murderers. Corvo is given a chance to escape from prison and to help the Empress' daughter by putting some key people out of action. At the same time, the city Dunwall is under the influence of the pest. It is a tale of treason, murder and decay.After the first mission, you get the visit of a mystical pressence that grants you some magical powers, like teleporting, called blink, and see-through vision. However, you are penalized by using lethal weapons or powers. So you end up using the basic non lethal powers in order to get around the levels unnoticed. Do not get confused by the screenshots you might see everywhere: as with the Hitman games, it is best to avoid combat.The level I liked the most is the one that happens during a mask dance, because it is the only time where you can spend doing some detective work. The target for that mission is one of the three Boyle sisters, but you do not know which one is the target. You are only told that is the only way to leave the Lord Regent without any support. I do not know why taking one of the carefree partygoer sisters matters at all. As with the Hitman games, the overall story is lead by a tiny string.There is a goal marker in most of the missions, so it is fairly clear where you need to go and what to do. Some people like this kind of guiding, others not. Difficulty is on the easy side of things, so that most people should not get frustated by the game.Technically speaking, the game is dull. It is your typical console game of year 2011/12, so you have load screens between relatively short sections of the map and a low number of triangles on the character meshes. There aren't many persons wandering around (so it is easy to get around guards). The game does however have a fairly distinct artistic feel, with the character faces aiming for a more comic book feel. The only gripe here is that Corvo is not voiced, so I felt a little bit disconnected from the main character. The game does support the Xbox360 pad.Overall the game is OK, but not great.			"

												In more than a few ways Dishonored is the game that Bioshock Infinite wanted to be. The overall presentation of the two games are similar in more than a few ways. Both games use extensive world building to set the tone of the plot. Both are contined to a city that has as much personality as the characters that inhabit it. Dishonored takes place in Dunwall, a city that obviously has its inspiration taken from London. The world is on of industrial steampunk. Whale oil is a hot commodity that is used to power everything in the city. It's a shame the world is so much more interesting than the main plot, which is your standard revenge plot. This revenge story does leave room for a fun and dynamic morality system. Do you use the tools at your disposal to slaughter enemies by the dozens or do you sneak through the levels, only killing your main targets? It's definitely a fun juxtaposition between the two gameplay styles. Actual gameplay is again similar to Bioshock Infinite. Your left hand controls your powers, your right hand your sword. It's basic combat but it's fullfilling and gets the job done. How you play affects the world in small ways, such as how characters converse with you or how many enemies will be in an area. The game is fairly polished overall although there are a few things that are annoying. Enemies can sometimes be too perceptive. You'll get spotted a lot with no idea where or why. At your end of level tally, it's possible that you'll end up with kills even though you didn't kill anyone. I did glitch out once and fall through the floor. Once in the twenty or so hours I put into the game isn't bad though. Overall it's definitely a fun game that is worth a playthrough. I had much more fun than I expected. If you want to get the most out of the game make sure you explore the world and pay attention to your surroundings. It's definitely worth the $20 it goes for on the store and is aboslutely worth it if you pick it up on sale. There is a lot to love, even if the game does display the occasional hiccup here and there. I have to wonder why I'm writing this review after the game has been out for a year and most people have already picked it up. Anyways, hope this was useful for you.			"

												Its a solid stealth action game, with a great astheitc design. The game gives you a choice in how you aprouch it, you can stealthy and stick to the sadows or go guns blazing murdering everything in your path as an army of rats rips your enemys to pieces. Depending on which style you choose the game can take anywhere from 4-10 hours to complete, longer if you actively look for lore hidden in the many books found in the reasonably sized levels. However for replay value you will probably play the game at most 3 times to get all the possible endings; aswell the DLC is hit and miss with Trials of Dunwall being ok at best and while Knife of Dunwall and Brigmoore Whitches are excellent story wise, they do feel like they originally should have been the same piece of DLC. Never the less if the game of the year edition is on sale i heavily recommend it.			"

												Dishonored is a game that pays fitting tribute to its predecessors in the stealth-action--RPG genre; games like Thief and Thief II, System Shock 2, Deus Ex, and Deus Ex: Human Revolution among others.The game explores player choice in a backdrop with a stunning amount of world-building detail, immersive and compelling mechanics, artsyle, and rich story.  It's at its best when you sneak your way through the corrupted City in a non-lethal run, but it is sufficiently balanced that all kinds of playstyles can - and should - be explored.Above all, the game is fun, immersive, and highly enjoyable.  I can't sing it's praises enough.  It has been criticized for flat characters in NPCs, which I can understand if not entirely agree with, and it has a few minor frustrations (spawning enemies in a stealth game), but this game shines.  It's a must play for anyone who enjoyed the titles I mentioned a the start of this review, including the DLC.			"

												Dishonored has certainly won a place in my heart as one of my favourite games ever made. First of all, it has a great setting; Dunwall is inspired by a steampunk London in an apocalyptic state once it has been consumed by a life-threatening plague. This sets the scene for a unique world that I have never seen before in a game, and the city of Dunwall is certainly fun to explore and investigate, seeing the results of this terrible disease ruining this city.   Don't let the game's linearity fool you, there is a world to explore. One may not notice at first, even after the game tells you, but there are lots of different pathways and routes to take to get from point A to B. The world does change and adapt to the decisions you make, but not quite as much as you would probably have first thought. I have to say I was a little dissapointed to not notice many differences between my two playthroughs of roleplaying as a psychotic serial killer and Jesus the second. Towards thelater levels there certainly are differences, but nothing game changing, a few more weepers and rats, whooptedoo.   While I am on the subject of everything that is wrong with the game, I have to say it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh sure, the city of Dunwall is well designed, the character models are nice - even if most of the males have strangely large fingers - but texture quality is AWFUL. Don't inspect anything too closely or you may start to notice the terrible pixel smoothing, like when I found a sheet of paper that had no depth to it, it was clear it was painted onto the texture of the surface it was on. And the paper was at an angle, so the sides of it were pixelated.   The story in Dishonored is nothing overly special. It's nicely written, but nothing too complex. You get framed for the death of the Empress because you're her bodyguard and now you will seek revenge and find her daughter and keep her safe. There, I've summed it up rather quickly. It does get some uniqueness by being set in a steampunk plague infested London, and the love between the protagonist and the Empress' daughter is rather touching, but no one gets enough character development that I would feel like I would risk my life for them.   But the game certainly does deliver in the gameplay. If you like steath, you'll love this, and even if you don't like stealth, I still think there's fun to be had. The swordplay, while a bit tricky to get into at first, is great. A swordfight and magic fight with someone who is just as gifted of an assassin as you are is one of the greatest experiences in the game, and certainly satisfying once you beat them.   Speaking of assassination, this game does assassination better than any other I have found. Assassin's Creed may advertise as being an assassin game, but that franchise started off as being a good, if repetetive assassin game and slowly went downhill into a bussiness simulator in the 19th century, before it then dug a hole straight through to China when it became a pirate game instead.   If you rush through Dishonored, it won't last long. Sneak through it, and it'll last ages. If you like it, you'll want to beat it again, this time on the opposite chaos. If you're like me, who loves this game so dearly, you'll strive to collect all the achievements, which will make the game last tens of hours.			"

												This game is insanely good. The plot is incredible, the gameplay is stellar, and the graphics are gorgeous. I 100% recommend this game to anyone and evryone. It is quite graphic at times, with awesome takedowns, assassinations, and lethal blows. It is by far the best stealth game i have evr played. While the game is somewhat short, it is well worth it because of the replay value. There is so much to do in each level and so much to get. I beat the game and have goten nowhere near all of the powerups and abilities in store for you. So i would recommend everyone give this game a try.			"

												One of my absoulte favourite first-person titles of all time. A well-crafted combination of Half Life, Thief and Mirror's Edge combining into a unique blend of stealth, action and storytelling unlike any other game. Audiovisually impeccable, Dishonored let's you explore and be amazed by it's architechture, and it's characters, while not necessarily the smartest in gaming history, are some of the most colourful and well-acted I've ever seen.To top things off, I'll make an exception to my usual ""no DLC ever"" -policy and recommend the two story DLC packs for this game as well. Neither of the DLC's alone is much, but together they weave into the story of the main game and fill the player in on one of the least fleshed out, yet most important characters in the game.My only gripe is the passivity of the protagonist, Corvo, as his fall during a certain point in the game feel far too forced. Still, this game comes highly recommended, despite a minor gripe here or there.Playtime: 25+ hours (single playthrough, including DLC)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 10Audio: 10Story: 9Gameplay: 9Overall: 9			"

												The trend of hyper-long games has left me with a lot of half-finished games in my library -  but Dishonored was never going to be one of those. I was hooked before I ever played it (what part of ""magic steampunk parkour assassin"" DOESN'T sound like a dream come true?) and once I started I knew I'd be in for the whole ride. The story is relatively generic but the setting and characters make it plenty interesting and compelling.The gameplay is great fun, and I appreciate that the ""good"" and ""bad"" endings (which are based on how much chaos your actions cause in the city as a whole) make sense for the play style that cause them. Climbing around on rooftops and plotting the demise of the guards was awesome, and when you get into the fray you get to make use of some of the other cool abilities. The setting itself is where the game really shines. The steampunk-esque (fantasy industrial? Whale-oil-punk?) world is full of detail from the grimy streets where commoners scuttle around like plague-rats to the sumptuous abodes of the nasty, plotting upper class. There's a clear aesthetic at work everywhere you look and the attention to detail is clear.			"

												When playing Dishonored, I am reminded of the tingling sensation I got when I first watched the Bioshock Infinite trailer a couple of years ago, and it achieves this through its own cool art style and steampunk-leanings.The way it's played is entirely down to you. It's not an open-world, but you can go non-lethal (even for the people you are supposed to assassinate, which is a nice touch), kill every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the map or go for anything in between.And it’s the sneaky non-lethal parts of this game that remind me of Thief. And I don't say that lightly. It would never be a contender for Garrett's throne, though: Corvo appears to be completely mute, more in line with heroes such as Gordon Freeman than the enigmatic Garrett, and perhaps this is to the game's detriment. However, Dishonored is a thoroughly enjoyable experience, and one that everyone who enjoys stealthy games, or even a rose-tinted gleam in their eye over the Thief series (or the original BioShock) should try.

												This is one of the better stealth action/adventure games that I have played in a long time. The gameplay and story is linear, but the level design and multiple ways to get to your objective keeps the game from feeling stale. The weapons in the game are so-so. The majority of the time you will be teleporting around and stabbing people in the back with your blade. The only real time you use weapons is when you alert a guard and an entire militia comes after you. The graphics are decent. I am using SweetFX to make the colors more vibrant and add a little more anti-aliasing. The Unreal Engine is not pushed to the limit here. The art direction is similar to Bioshock:Infinite, but with a lot less attention to detail.			"

And you can make lots of customisations to the user interface to make it play exactly as you like it.2. The steam achievements. There's loads of them and they make you do things in the game you wouldn't normally think about. Adds a layer of depth.3. Stealth versus lethal. And the combination of weapons and powers. Being able to play the game as you want to in your own style and not be penalised for it, instead it simply changes the story slightly. Genius.I can see why it scored over 90 in the metacritic score.

												I absolutely love this game! If you haven't played it yet and you love games with alternate play styles, engaging storylines and RP choices that have actual impacts on your playthrough, then you're missing out. Keep in mind I may be biased as I normally love any kind of dark, gritty story that takes place in a dystopian society... However trust me when I say that this game is absolutely brilliant! I loved how it was acceptable for me to progress through quests with a clear objective, then to decide halfway through that I did not agree with it and do something completely different to make the ends meet. I was not led by hand through the game, I was allowed to play as I saw fit; It could be anything from scaling the chandeliers of a house to protecting a local thug from a crazy old bat. With every playthrough I discover something new, characters reacting to me in a different manner, new opportunities, stumbling upon side-characters I've never met before because I chose a different route and so on.However I do have a wee bit of nitpicking, very insignificant though I might add. I would've appreciated a short prologue in which I was allowed to get to know the Empress and Emily, I found myself not caring much for them, Emily did grow on me though as I got to interact with her. I also would've have liked more side quests that aren't DLCs, while it was refreshing that there were few, I also felt that they were so well made that I sort of wanted more... TL;DR - 10/10			"

I'd rather have more non-lethal ways to go around the world. It doesn't really seem to reflect the way you handle assassinations (which you CAN do non-lethally) in the way other characters talk to you after the missions.

												A great sneakin' stabbin' game with gadgets and magical powers set in a steampunky world. Biggest downside is how killing people is so fun, but you get penalized for it by people thinking you're a♥♥♥♥♥♥and getting a bad end. Coolest part is how Satan comes into your dreams and gives you magic powers for no other reason than wanting to see what you'll do with them.Pro tip: There's a non-lethal way to deal with all of the major assasination targets and they're always much, much darker, more twisted, and more fun than the lethal ones. This is quite the achievement considering the lethal tricks include turning people to dust, feeding them to magically summoned rats, teleport-stabbing them from ten metres away, and drowning them in their bathtubs after knocking them unconcious.Disclaimer: I have a piece of paper saying that I'm sane and totally allowed to work with children.Oh and the DLC is pretty good too!

												This game was amazing from beginning to end. Its Story kept you going and its gameplay was spectacular. You have full control and your outcome changes and fits with how you decide to play. This game is for the stealth veterans and not so easy on newcomers but its enjoyable no matter what level of skill you have. A great game overall and I cannot wait to pick up the sequal to this game.			"

												This is a game you want for a semi decent story which has very smooth movement. Any spells you obtain in the game is very fluent and the dark style pieces it all together. This game isn't for the people who like running and gunning, or someone even wanting a simple game, this game would be a waste of money if you did not go around and explore it for the easter eggs and side quest you could find.

												At first i was unsure whether i should get this game, then it came onto the winter holiday sale, so i bought it and now cannot stop playing it, this game is amazing in every way. The story is grasping and thrilling with unexpected twists that surprise you, the combat is very smooth and not buggy at all, the graphics are pretty good but it is meant to be a game where the graphics are not as important as the gameplay. overall i would give this a 9.5/10.

												This game is a solid game. The story is good, the controls are really solid and nice. The developers put a good effort into this one. Not a single hang or glitch. You can replay it in different styles head-on vs stealth. You might also need to do that if you want to get the achievements. But it is a single player game. For me that's okay, but for others this may be a downside.			"

												A very enjoyable game, but also somewhat of disappointment. I probably wanted it to be like Thief more than I should have, and although there are many similarities to Thief, the game-play just doesn't live up to it. The story, design and characters are all superb, and it's proof that a new idea, and a different approach to the typical shooter, can be successful.By the time I'd finished the game, trying to keep the death-count as low as possible, I felt like I'd missed out on taking a more savage approach to the missions. So I replayed the whole game, and tried to kill as many of the bad-guys as possible (and even a few innocents along the way), and it was like a different game. I'm all for choice within game, and a flexibility to how missions can be approached, but I think the game would have been slightly improved by, once in a while, forcing you to take either a stealthy approach or a guns-blazing approach (similar to the Thief games). This would have meant that someone like me, who's default approach would always be stealth, would have had the chance to let-loose once in a while. I know that choice was always there, and I could have done exactly that at any point, but I didn't really believe that the bad-guys really deserved to die. They were just following whomever was in command, after all. My immersion in the game's narrative was actually preventing me from having a bit of fun. Maybe if some of the levels contained baddies who really deserved getting blown-up or an arrow to the head I would have had more chance to use more of my weaponry on my first play-though. There were times when a stealthy approach was the best way to avoid being killed, so these situations forced you to use more softly-softly tactics, but there was no point when a more action-packed method was essential. Sometimes, too much choice is a bad thing.Once I did decided to replay the game and in a more gung-ho fashion, I noticed how much EASIER the game had become. I could breeze through some of the levels in a fraction of the time I did when I was trying not to kill anyone, and I started to understand the criticism of those who took this approach on their first play-though and felt short-changed.Also, I appreciate the fact that the developers spent a lot of time to make sure each platform was given individual focus, but it still felt as if the PC version retained too many aspects of the console version. The ability to turn off most of the HUD elements, for example, is proof of this, but it took so long for me to figure-out which I needed and which I didn't that it probably spoiled the opening chapter. There's no evidence (despite what some may believe) that PC gamers over the age of 18 are any more intelligent than console gamers over the age of 18, so introducing ways to make the game easier, beyond the usual difficulty levels; which generally affect combat rather than game-play; can only be catering specifically to younger players. And that is just WRONG. Anyway, I digress.Despite all this, Dishonored was like a breath of fresh-air, and I hope it gives more developers the courage to try something different with the common FPS. And I eagerly look forward to the inevitable sequel. Instead of filling the Thief-void, though, it just made me want Thief 4 to come sooner.			"

												It's a fun game with uniquely smooth firest-person freerunning mechanics that won't turn your stomach; it's definitely worth two playthroughs.  The story is good but the writting and delivery sometimes falter.  Open combat and gorey murder sprees are fun but almost too easy, especially as you get better toys and powers.  The game is only really challenging if you try to use stealth and complete missions with zero-kills.  It's also very rewarding to realize you found a path that maybe wasn't intentional.Edit:  The Knife of Dunwall and Brigmore Witches DLC are also well worth the time and money.  Together the two mission packs nearly double the game's campaign content.  They also flesh out one of the more interesting and conflicted characters who you get very little time with in the main campaign.			"

												Intense, enjoyable game. The many play-styles of this game are its strong point, stealth, tanking, a combination, assassination, going undetected and going non-lethal are all awesome ways to play, and are encouraged through the achievements, which require at least two or three playthroughs to get them all. The art is qwerky yet not too cartoonish, music is awesome and the setting of a steampunky decaying city on the coast feels so comfortable. With the introduction of supernatural powers to the physical elements the game just broadens as a whole, with the different powers and upgrades, as well as managing your money on upgrades for your sword, body and crossbow the game can be enjoyed by absolutely anyone. The general feel of the game from the art, setting, music and sound makes the game contantly intense, I love it.Overall review: 5/5			"

												This is game is one of those REAL STEALTH GAMES, meaning there's actually a need to sneak, not like that other assassin game :P This game requires a lot of patientce, although you could finish the game within a day, you'd be missing out on the back story of things. Pay attention to details, for they also add color to the picture. Lot's of books and notes around here, pretty weird stuff but quite interesting.This game is just one of those games where you can be really creative with your approach to situations, sometimes you could even get carried away with the many things you can do within the game. Pretty good mechanics, lots of stuff around. Players looking for a challenge can go try playing the game with just the blink ability and finish the game without acquiring other abilities and/or enhancement.The only downside to this game for me is that it doesn't include a variety of graphics settings, you'd have to tweak things in the ini file and add better AA via your video driver. But doing those things is just a one time task and you'll be enjoying the rest of the game without them jaggies :PAll-in-all a really great game which definitely deserves the title Game of the Year :D			"

												*This long review will not spoil any story elements*This game plays right and feels right. If you shoot a guard in the leg, he grabs his leg and falls over. If you steal from someone who sees you, they warn you and eventually run to authorities. The game is very rewarding no matter if you play it loud or quietly. How you do the missions is up to you. I prefer to kill everything and loot everything. But, now I know I must replay the game and focus on stealth or magic playthroughs.A lot of the actions make sense and the ragdoll physics can be hilarious at times (which is necessary in this game - you'll see what I mean). I bust out laughing when I sleep dart any NPC and go up their unconscious body, loot them, and then carry them to a ledge of a high area and throw them off of it while they're still asleep. It's even more funny to throw them into pirahna-infested waters while they're asleep.Sound: 10/10Music: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10-Sometimes there is some BS, but very infrequent. Game is punishing if you think you're a god.-Any NPC is slayable.-A lot of gold is hard to come by.-Game progressively gets harder, more fun and more chaotic.-There are only 26 Runes in one playthrough, but you need 39 Runes to unlock EVERY trait. Pick your traits carefully.-Bone charms do not disappear when used/activated. Each bone charm is unique.Replayability: 7/10-You know the story the first playthrough, what changes next is HOW you want to beat the game again.-Any way you decide to play is enjoyable.Story: 10/10-Takes place in a rather chaotic time for the entire country. Now you add to the chaos based on how you play. I won't spoil anything for you... the story is ramped up, climactic, fun. It feels like you're actually running the whole story.DLC: 10/10-Great DLC. You can play as a different assassin with ALL NEW abilities.OVERALL SCORE: 9.0/10.0-The metacritics also gave a similar rating to mine, but this is how I feel the really deserves.-I hope they make a Dishonored 2. I would buy it for $50.			"

												So I just finished this game. I have to say - I absolutely loved the story, the setting, and the way your choices affected the way events played out. The game itself is played as a relatively short series of relatively long missions. Along the way, there's many things to collect that can easily be missed - bone charms that disappear if you don't nab them at a certain point, changing audio logs of NPCs and fleeting conversations. The former can be a bit frustrating, but the latter is always fun to collect, and illustrates the characters around you nicely. The powers were quite fun to use, and the game provided many, many ways to proceed on missions; things were never impossible, but having a certain ability would often open up a path. My largest complaint, however, would be that the game hands you a wide arsenal of killing tools and powers and then heavily discourages using them. The game has, basically, two paths; low chaos (nonlethal, stealth) and high chaos (lethal). There's a third tier, very high chaos, which is for the most part the same as high chaos, but nets even worse reactions from your allies (at this point, your Corvo Attano is pretty much murdering everyone he sees for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.) High chaos is easier to do at the beginning, because you don't have many powers yet, and the early missions take place in populated areas - but as the game progresses, high chaos creates more enemies, worse situations, crueller allies, and darker endings. It's understandable and rationalized from a story perspective - more bodies means more rats means more plague, and your allies follow the example you make - but given how much gamers are used to killing the bad guys being a core part of games - well, expect to spend some time adjusting with Dishonored, unless you want to see cute little Emily devolve into a tyrant. Also, if you're playing stealthy, which you should be - well, expect a lot of save scumming. When I played, I was saving on average of once every two minutes, sometimes even more often.			"

												i have been waiting for this game since i heard about it and recently i picked it up on sale 50% off and even if i ended up paying full price for this i would still love it just as much. now to get something out of the way i keep hearing is that people keep ♥♥♥♥♥ing its short well i have news for you the length of the game depends on your playstyle so if you rush through it and dont bother reading all the notes and books and listening to all the great dialog that gives you clues for your mission then that is your fault you made the game short so stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing and complaining i on the other hand had a blast with this game i took my time explored as much as i could each mission read every book i found and just immersed myself in the world and was absolutely blown away with the rich world arkane createdthe story is fantastic and is in my opinion the best story in any game this year especially when you find out a lot of the clues leading to corvo`s backstory as well as other characters in the game this game is the true meaning of play your way there are so many ways to approach a situation with even more choices then you get in the deus ex or thief games + all the creative ways of dealing with enemies i highly recommend anyone to pick this game up especially if you are a fan of the deus ex games or thief games Dishonored = those games on steroids hands down it is my GOTY Dishonored>anything released in 2012 "

												Dishonored is somewhat short, but it is exceptionally well done through and through. The whole premise of the story is that you're framed for a murder you didn't commit and you are now going after your framers to fix things. The plot and environment are extremely well done, and there is plenty of optional lore via conversations and books.As you play, you'll unlock magical enhancements that can make you're character one with the shadows or an unstoppable force. The game lets you choose between being sneaky or straightforward, and between killing or not. There is a plague, so more death means a darker story and a more powerful plague (and plague enemies).Overall it's extremely well done. If you enjoy stealth games, or just melee games that have some magic and strategy in there, then I heavily recommend this game.			"

												Assassination gameplay was great. The sophisticated level designs allow you to play the game with your own style, whether it be stealth or straight up rambo, and your choices actually have a very significant impact on how the game plays out! (ex. lethal or non-lethal assassinations) The game itself is very linear, but on the other hand there were many fun side quests to earn extra bonuses like cash. There is lots of customization with weapons, items, and skills as you progress through the game, which is also a nice touch. Plot was very straightforward but decent. Overall Dishonored is a good buy that is worth the money.			"

												Decent enough game, but basically Deus Ex for consoletards meets Bioshock. AI is pretty dumb and won't be alerted even if they look in your direction but just so happen to be far away. Also there's not enough variation in gameplay for a non lethal playthrough - you end up just using the sleep darts as a weapon and the usual sneak up from behind takedowns. Some gas grenades would've been nice at a minimum.Overall I'd say a 7/10. Not GOTY material because it really is babby's first stealth game and typical console port (viewmodel FOV is lol). Play Deus Ex or Thief if you want a more challenging/enjoyable experience.			"

												For many years Thief series was one of my favourite games of all times. After the third game, which was slightly worse than second one, I was waiting for a new game done in the similar fashon. And for many years there was nothing out there. And then came Dishonored. The game so good that now I prefer it over Thief. The game I've finished five times already and will probably do few more runs. The game that lets you choose a style of play - you can be a shadow, you can be a tank, you can be an invisible predator. You can eachieve your goals in many ways, you can finish a game without hurting anyone or you can kill everyone you see moving. A steampunk world of Dunwall is also interesting and the only problem I see in this game is that it's short. It comes with two brilliant DLCs thought (Knife of Dunwall and The Brightmore Witches) and a mediocre one (Dunwall City Trials). Overall, this game is high on my Top 10 list of games of all times.

												Its a solid stealth action game, with a great astheitc design. The game gives you a choice in how you aprouch it, you can stealthy and stick to the sadows or go guns blazing murdering everything in your path as an army of rats rips your enemys to pieces. Depending on which style you choose the game can take anywhere from 4-10 hours to complete, longer if you actively look for lore hidden in the many books found in the reasonably sized levels. However for replay value you will probably play the game at most 3 times to get all the possible endings; aswell the DLC is hit and miss with Trials of Dunwall being ok at best and while Knife of Dunwall and Brigmoore Whitches are excellent story wise, they do feel like they originally should have been the same piece of DLC. Never the less if the game of the year edition is on sale i heavily recommend it.			"

												This game is for the most part action and stealth.  The main character is assigned targets that he may eliminate in a variety of different but fulfilling methods.  There is an interesting system of chaos.  The chaos will affect the next level.  High chaos makes the game more challenging and low chaos seems to make the game easier.  This system will punish players that chose a direct path rather than the stealthy path.  However, it is still possible to beat the game.  There is also an exploring aspect to each level to collect different items like collectibles.  The completion of each level is displayed when you finish the level.  The games has some rpgish element in the way you upgrade the character.  This game was an overall enjoyment.			"

												Easily Recomended.A very entertaining game with the only real downside being its short length. The problem of length is easily fixed by waiting for it to go on sale and getting the game of the year version with all the DLC. Even with that it hardly matters as it is worth at least 2 playthroughs. My own advice would be for you to do the first playthrough without stealth as much as possible to familiarize yourself with the combat.P.S. If you are EVER stuck trying to stealth, here is a tip: Look Up. There will almost always be a pipe, a street lamp, a chandelier, SOMETHING, that will solve your problems.			"

												The only bad thing about this game is that if you're going for a no kill run be careful where you place your passed out buddies. If rats eat them or they get blown up or they get knocked over and drown or just die from the fall damage that counts as you murdering them. There's another hint for doing a no kill run but it would kinda spoil an aspect of the story so just play the game. Voice acting, level design, story, graphics, etc etc it's all great. And most importantly it's incredibly fun. One of my top 10 games even though it came out just 4 years ago.			"

												A game like Bioshock (the two good ones at least), this game has a rich story accompanied by incredable stealth and combat mechanics.  Never before have I experienced the feeling of being a legitament badass assassin.In the game, you play as a man, Corvo, framed for murdering the Empress and hiding away Emily, her beloved daughter, your are tried and sentenced to death.  However, you escape with the help of a small group dedicated to helping you.  They know the truth about you.Following after your escape, you act as an assassin, taking out targets and completing missions.  Each mission is very flexible, for you can play through and complete them in many ways.  There WILL be a way you can fit your playstyle in this game.  Additionally, those who would rather take the role of a stealthy(er) assassin, may find much enjoyment from sneaking around and taking out or incapacitating targets.The only issue I have with this game is Chaos, a mechanic that limits the player being at least this stealthy.  For example, killing too many will make your allies act differently toward you, and changing the overall game environment.  While it is arguable that this mechanic makes the game better by adding more challenges, I find it a bit of a pain because the thought of it pops in your head if you ever choose to kill a guard or something.Overall 9/10, worth getting (like Bioshock), especially when on sale.

												This game is HELLA short, I beat it in one day on the trial, so the trial worked out well! Even tho I beat it, there is more than one ending to the game and since the game was great the first time, going back and trying to be more stealthy would be fun to do, see what other endings may pop out.If you haven't decided whether or not to get the game, it is worth it, ON SALE. I think the game is too short to be $20, you may or may not get only around 10 hours out of the game as if you are a hardcore gamer you can blaze thru this in probably under 3 hours, then go back and get a different ending even faster. The game had a great story, minus the outsider who had no real business other then giving you powers, and also the lack of in real time change of how your actions affect people (would of been great to see them react differently when I came back after slaughtering everyone) after a mission, because then I would of been able to change mission to mission to maybe get a different ending but no one reacted majorly so I just kept doing the same and then by the end I had no chance of recovery.Everything in this game is fun and unique, some things seem really unrealistic to the era or even to anything but if you can get over it the game is really enjoyable.GET THIS GAME WHILST IT IS ON SALE! 8.5/10			"

												The phrase “stealth mechanic” and/or “stealth mission” probably causes the everyday gamer to shudder. More often than not these are tedious, slow portions of a story which usually highlight the worst in level design, mechanics, and AI shenanigans. What starts off as the ""good intentions"" of a player in trying to properly sneak around ends up with the Rambo'ing of an entire level out of sheer frustration.Not with Dishonored.I've yet to play any stealth based game, including any Metal Gear Solid offering (arguably considered the king of stealth) that supplies the level of fluidity, options, and satisfaction in not being seen or shedding a single drop of blood that Dishonored provides. So much so that any time I had my cover broken, and invariably forced to switch to lethal methods, I felt a sense of responsibility to the spirit of the story to load a previous save and try utilizing different areas of the level or player abilities to successfully get through said portion completely unseen. In any other game I would consider this a complete waste of time, and slightly insane. But like I said, the “cool factor” of the stealth here is so freaking cool that you have to indulge it. The atmosphere, level design, and characters within the game are equally top notch. One thing I really appreciated was the fact that you don't have to suspend your disbelief too hard to get into the role of the main character, as the design decision not to make him talk (or see what he looks like) is absolutely the right one for a game of this nature. Brilliant all around. Can't wait for the sequel.			"

Do it.Like stopping time, attatching an explosive to a rat, posessing the rat, and running in the middle of a group of guards to kill them?  Do it.This is an action-stealth game with a linear story but many options on how to complete your objectives.  Each part of the world you go to has a ton of places to explore and items to find, too.  You can even take out your assassination targets in a non-lethal (and many times extremely creepy) way.I highly recommend this game to any who liked the early Thief games as well as any who just like dark, interesting, story lines with stealth and murder.

There's a lot of path depend on your playstyle even the whole game is linear. However, I feel like story writing is rushed in some points, but it's doesn't matter.

												It's a fun game with uniquely smooth firest-person freerunning mechanics that won't turn your stomach; it's definitely worth two playthroughs.  The story is good but the writting and delivery sometimes falter.  Open combat and gorey murder sprees are fun but almost too easy, especially as you get better toys and powers.  The game is only really challenging if you try to use stealth and complete missions with zero-kills.  It's also very rewarding to realize you found a path that maybe wasn't intentional.Edit:  The Knife of Dunwall and Brigmore Witches DLC are also well worth the time and money.  Together the two mission packs nearly double the game's campaign content.  They also flesh out one of the more interesting and conflicted characters who you get very little time with in the main campaign.			"

The many play-styles of this game are its strong point, stealth, tanking, a combination, assassination, going undetected and going non-lethal are all awesome ways to play, and are encouraged through the achievements, which require at least two or three playthroughs to get them all. The art is qwerky yet not too cartoonish, music is awesome and the setting of a steampunky decaying city on the coast feels so comfortable. With the introduction of supernatural powers to the physical elements the game just broadens as a whole, with the different powers and upgrades, as well as managing your money on upgrades for your sword, body and crossbow the game can be enjoyed by absolutely anyone. The general feel of the game from the art, setting, music and sound makes the game contantly intense, I love it.Overall review: 5/5			"

												Games as beautiful, fun, and engrossing as this don't come around everyday, which only serves to intensify the frustration that the story has no wind in its sails. It would have been easy enough to explain the protagonists' powers using the gorgeous whalepunk setting, the developers felt it necessary to force in witches, gods, and enough thematic references to Bioshock to make you sick. This game is certainly jaw droppingly gorgeous, plays arguably better, and the powers are very, very fun (you'll spend all day blinking to across rooftops), but ultimately you'll feel as if more focus on the rat plague and the central characters would have made you care more. It may never be Bioshock, as it desperately wants to be, but that won't stop you from enjoying every single minute inside this game. Forget the story they give you, and enjoy the amount of actual playing you can achieve, and you will be handsomely rewarded.			"

												You are Corvo, a royal bodyguard turned into a cold-hearted assassin, passing judgement on the authority figures of Dunwall, killing everyone in sight. You assassinate guards and corrupt leaders by the dozen, using a blade, a crossbow, and occasionally go all out, blasting people down with a powerful handgun. You are the most murderous being in history. Or not. You can make your way through every candle-lit hallway, smoke-filled room, and gloomy street with complete silence, never taking a life, and only taking someone down by suffocating people in to a still alive unconsiousness. You never have to take a life. You can slip past guards and expose the evil authority as corrupt. Not a single drop of blood has to touch your blade, not a single dead man has to hit the cobble-stone, growing colder by the second. You can change the world in whatever way you wish. As one of the best games I've ever played, I would highly recommend it to anyone.			"

												This is one of the best games i've played on the PC, it is very well designed and has several different ways you can play for different outcomes at the end of the game. This allows you to play the game several different times with different strategies and goals in mind when you play.			"

												Like a suckerpunch Dishonored floored me without me being prepared the slightest for it. A well written story, immersive gameplay and beautiful art direction made this game soar straight to the top of my favorite games that I've played. The diffrent endings give it some type of replayability, if not only for the ending itself but how you solve the missions as well.You are a assassin with the ability to see through walls, teleport and stop/bend time. If that doesn't get you hot and botherd I don't know what will. Seriously, go buy it.			"

												Really enjoyed this game.  Glad I got the GOTY edition while it was on sale.  The variations of how you could play the levels was great.  The level up system for your character was good, and needing to find the ""rune"" currency to upgrade your skills kept you engaged in more than just the main story.  Graphics were pretty good, the steam punk scenery may not be the most visually stunning, but it was fitting and not distracting.  I also really enjoyed that as you picked up items that had no value except trading for money, the items gave you that value and you didn't have to manage a complex inventory with encumbrance.  Some might say this isn't as real, but I felt like in games like Fallout you ended up spennding more time on that than the game at times.  It allowed me to just play the game rather than become a warehouse manager, which was cool.The DLC has also been great.  Good added value to the games.  I like how they show you a different side of the story than what you see in the main game.  More of the same with some additional skills and such.  Very much worth the on sale price.  Kept me wanting to come back, and I'll definitely replay all the missions over with a different take on the action (ie; more stealth).			"

DishonoredMy rating of the game will be split into 5 categories.-Atmosphere-Story-Gameplay-Characters-GraphicsDepending on however well it did, it will recieve a...1 - Perfect2 - Excellent3 - Good4 - Average5 - Below Average6 - BadAtmosphere1 - Perfect.""I'd say I was being punished, but I know the world doesn't punish wicked people.""Everything this game sets out to do in it's steampunky version of a Victorian England-esque London is done with the most attention to detail.Story3 - Good.This is the game's weakest point. While it is still good, it is rather predictable. It does have one or two surprising twists which you won't expect nearing the end of the game.Gameplay2 - Excellent.The gameplay is another strong point. There are so many different ways you can approach a level and deal with the scenario, from storming the front gate and killing everything inside, to sneaking in by teleporting up with your supernatural powes and knocking out the guards. However, the reason this is not  perfect is because there are only two ways of taking out enemies in a non-lethal way.Characters1 - Perfect""Think you'll get your own squad after what happened last night?""Characters in this game are brilliantly voice acted and have backstories you can find out about throughout the plot and by reading notes. For some reason, I feel the developers wanted to give everyone and English/British accent but later gave up and just got American voice actors to fill in guard dialogue and some major characters. But, that's no problem.Graphics2 - ExcellentDishonored's art style may seem similar to something along the lines of Half Life. That's because the man behind the art style was also the one behind Half Life's. The tone is a very darky brown setting, which perfectly fits the theme of a city ravaged by plague. Up close, the textures can look muddy and stretched, but that's just something you have to live with. If a dark tone isn't your style, there are multiple SweetFX mods that can change the overall colour of the game. Overall Rating - 9/10 [Near Perfect]""I wonder, are you chasing something... or running away?"" "

												Best stealth game I have ever played (short of Dishonored 2, because I haven't played that yet and I think it'll be even better). Speedrunners can finish this game in about 35 minutes, but if you really take your time and do everything there is to do in the interesting and bizarre world, you'll probably get more than 12 hours out of the main story. Not to speak of the 4 DLC, which are available for less than 5€.			"

												This is a ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant game. Great story, good gameplay, and a unique feature, the Blink-182 (a shortdistance teleport) that actually adds to gameplay rather than being a useless gimmick crowbarred in for the sake of being original. The only slight dowsides are that the dialogue sounds like it was written for people suffering from severe amnesia. Like how the NPC's always very ham-handedly mention every story development in conversation to make sure you don't get lost, which makes it hard to connect with the characters. Also, the guard dialogue is a bit weird. They have a set number of standard responses, and when another guard asks them something, they will randomly choose one of those, without regard to whether it's appropriate for the situation. So you'll hear stuff like:Guard A: ""Let's go for whisky and cigars tonight.""Guard B: ""Chances are very good.""But besides that the game is amazing. The level design is great and really encourages the use of your Blink power. The combat is fluent and responsive and stealth is fun and challenging.Overall, this game isn't as good as Thief II, but it's damn close.9/10			"

												Easily one of the best stealth games I've ever played, and certainly the best first-person stealth game since Thief: The Dark Project first hit the scene in '98. In fact, Dishonored (sic) is almost excessively reminiscent of Thief, taking on a similar steampunk aesthetic although Thief's steampunk was of a more dark ages/medieval flavour than Dishonored's victorian stylings.The painted textures are very pleasing to the eye, the stealth mechanics are superb and the plot is interesting. The only issue is the morality system which causes characters unfavourably to you (down to calling you a -monster-) if you kill too many of the vicious, petty and murderous guards. This, of course, is irrespective of whether you killed them purposefully or due to knocking over a potted plant and having them run headfirst onto your sword. I've always been annoyed at how stealth games will give you one or two dull ways of non-lethally neutralizing enemies while giving you dozens upon dozens of amusing ways to kill them - and then give you the 'bad' ending if you use them. A game should not punish a player for enjoying themselves.But this is a minor quibble, the ""bad"" ending isn't that bad. It's still an excellent game and if the pooch finds itself thoroughly screwed with regards to Thief 4, at least we'll always have Dishonored (sic).			"

												If BioShock can be described as a spiritual successor to System Shock 2 then Dishonored can just as easily lay claim to being a spiritual successor to the Thief series. But that's not all that's contained within its DNA. You'll also find bits of Deus Ex (a mixture of lethal and non-lethal approaches, as well as weapons and skills upgrades) and Half-Life 2 (the two games share the same visual concept artist and a similarly oppressive regime who hide themselves away in a large tower while the world around them falls apart).By taking the lethal approach (""kill everyone!""), opting for the ""easy"" difficulty and turning all the HUD elements on (especially objective markers), Dishonored will be a short, brutal experience that may seem lacking. Opt for a non-lethal approach, on ""hard"" difficulty, with objective markers turned off (plus item glow, if you're brave), and you'll be in for a much longer and ultimately more rewarding experience as the world of Dunwall is afforded more opportunities to seep into your pores.An essential purchase if you're still pining for the days when Looking Glass Studios were still around. Or if you're simply sick and tired of most modern first-person shooters treating you like an idiot.			"

												Dishonored has beautiful art direction with concept art illustrated by Half-Life 2 concept artist Viktor Antonov that in spite of somewhat low-res texture work, really makes the game look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Though the main plot is a bit weak, most of the more self-contained stuff, as well as the world-building, is brilliant, and combined with the excellent open 3D first-person stealth-focused level design, the game essentially functions as a bigger-budget love letter to the original Thief trilogy, taking lots of inspiration and sneaking in more than a couple references to the many games that inspired it, but also doing a good job setting itself apart.

												Before purchasing this game, I wasn't really thinking much of it. It was just going to be a pass time game for me... For when other games got a bit boring for me, the main one being CS:GO. After hours of gameplay, the game got me hooked. This game feels like you completely have the freedom to do as you please. In missions, you have many ways to approach them, not to mention the amazing weapons and abilities you can use.  I now find myself periodizing this game over all others. I've now abandoned my friend's five queue on CS:GO. I've left my job, my wife, kids, and I'm 3.2 milliom dollars in debt, but this game keeps the mood up. Definitely worth the money.			"

												Dishonored feels like Bioshock meets Hitman: Absolution with a mix of Assassin's Creed and a pinch of Darkness 2. The gameplay is very enjoyable and offers a multitude of play styles to suit your individual taste. The basic climbing aspects combined with the Blink power makes for some fluid and easy movements in the vertical space.The graphics really didn't inspire me to say wow, but they did fit the dark plague theme. It was also hard to understand the timeline between the plague (past) and available technology (futuristic). I also didn't really grasp the supernatural storyline at all so that aspect left me confused, but the revenge storyline was highly enjoyable. Although I always found it weird that a couple of drunk alcoholics kept barking orders at me to kill people while they got to sit in their cozy little bar and drink all day.Unfortunately there was too much reading--I ended up skipping most of the historical books which I probably would have followed if the passages offered voice overs.Despite the minor imperfections, Dishonored is genuinely a good game. For me, the gameplay is what shined and that is why I would play it again.			"

												Amazing gameplay and story.During the first missions of this game I got quite discouraged to play due to the lack of action and story to the contrary to the description and reviewers described. It had gotten to the point in which I was considering a refund for the game. BUT DON'T BE DISCOURAGEDUpon finishing the first few missions, you notice certain repetitivity in the game's mechanic (which, by the way, is the most invigorating thing you could ever feel AKA it's a good thing). As you grow fluent with the game's mechanics, you enjoy the game more, and everything just feels so... SATISFYING.Once you break all the barriers, the story is AMAZING. The story, itself, gives you a reason to fear what there is to fear, to hate what there is to hate, and to feel what there is to feel. It makes you think and contemplate your actions (something not a lot of games nowadays are able to do).You know that you don't want to kill this guard because you don't want more rats & weepers. You know that if you did 'this' then eventually 'this' will happen. All in all, AWESOME game. Nothing can ever grasp the extent in which this game has reached.			"

												Buy this game.  The game is a great stealth/assassination type game with some great weapons/powers to make the whole experience fun and enjoyable.  The story is a little predicatable and some of the characters a little bland and underdeveloped but the narative, enviroments and atmosphere of the game as a whole make for a great experience.SPOILER WARNING:  However with all that being said there were several design choices that to me made no sense and took away from the game experience as a whole.  First off, it isn't until after your first mission/area is completed that you are told that if you kill or just incapacitate the guards\civilians\etc... it makes a difference.  That kind of thing needs to be front and center BEFORE you get the chance to knife the first guy, because that makes a big difference in how I want to approach the game.Secondly, the subtitle for this game should probably read ""I HOPE YOU LIKE A THOUSAND SHADES OF BROWN!!!"".  One of the first powers I took and maxed was a power that let you see all items and enemies in a close proximity to you.  I thought that was awesome, I can discover a lot of hidden objects, see where are all the enemies are, what direction they are facing for stealth take outs and where they are going to set up my next stealth take out.  The problem with this power is that it turns the whole enviroment different shades of brown then highlights all people/enemies as yellow and items as green.  Because this power costs little mana/energy and you can regenerate that little bit it uses there is no penalty for having this on and helping set up awesome stealth kills/take downs.  The problem becomes that the game is brown ALL THE TIME.  You can't enjoy the fantastic enviroments that were made or the design of Dunwall because the game was brown for me half the time.  I think a better option could have been made that didn't result in having a brown screen for most of the game.Lastly, it was incredibly frustrating going through this game and trying to not kill people.  Not because it was hard or anything, but it seems that the game from a control standpoint vastly favoured you trying to kill your targets instead of incapacitating them.  For example, if you get behind someone to make a stealth take down you get several different options.  You can kill them, chocke them(incapacitate them) or just loot them if they have something to be looted.   With killing the target it doesn't seem to matter where you are in relation to your target as long as you are somewhere behind/beside/above them.  However with choking/incapacitating them you have be in a very particular spot and sometimes the action button doesn't show up for second or two, especially when you drop in behind your target or use your movement power to land behind him.  This made it incredibly frustrating at times to try to string together a set of stealth take downs or resulted in being detected by your target.Again those are mostly minor annoyances, the game is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

												I don't know why I never left a review for this game, I've had it for a long time with over 300 hours logged. I just wanted to add that even if you're new to the sneaky stealthy genre this game is maybe for just about everyone. I'd give it an easy 5/5 for playability, story, graphics, action/puzzle ratio, REplayability, the DLC, everything. The trailer is good but still doesn't even really do the game justice. Now that it's on sale I highly HIGHLY recommend getting it. Not a game to be missed rspecially with a sequel on the way.			"

This game told his quest of revenge not to regain his honor but to rescue Emily and restore her rightful throne. Storywise, this game has a lot of interesting thing. But, the best thing of this game is you can use different method to accomplish his mission. Lethal? Non Lethal? Almost everything you do have impact in Corvo's world.

The rest of the game was completely engrossing and satisfying from start to finish. Great story too, I got the happy ending :P			"

												By far this has got to be one of the more amusing stealth action games out there. Fantastic graphics, interesting skills, world design and story are all quite well done. On top of that the 2 DLC Blade of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches are fantastic additions to the lore and main story itself. As it stars Daud who is an antagonist within the main campaign.Games mechanics are simple, yet the type of combinations that you can do are quite complex and can lead to some hilarious results.And for those who love to explore maps this game has one of the better designed ones allowing the characters to wander about in the levels trying to find every single bit of loot & coin to help power up ones character, along with the scattered lore which adds to the story of the world you are playing in.

												Released in October 2012, Dishonored is a stealth action-adventure video game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. Dishonored definitely holds place for one of the best games I have played. Why?Pros: + Amazing artistic capabilities from developer+ Optimization on its peak+ Plot in this game is outstanding+ Unique stealth and assassination mechanics + Unique abilities with variety of kill options+ Voice acting+ Upgrade and abilities system+ It took me about 11 hours to finish the game+ DLC'sCons:- Maybe only complain would be that in order to make all achievements, you have to buy all DLC's.Other then that, this game is very original. I already finished it two times. Second time, I finished it with achievement ""Clean Hands"", which means, you have to finish the game without killing and alerting anyone. So its definitely stealth game, but at the same time the game has one of the most unique lethal mechanics. And I can assure you, you won't regret buying it. Love it!			"

												9/10 - WHAT a game! Whether you want to be super stealthy or go on an all out rampage during the levels, this game has so many ways of being completed that one playthrough won't ever be enough!I was impressed at the level of detail the game went in to, from the over-arching story to the little snippets of conversation you pick up as you're sneaking past a group of guards. I'd recommend playing hard/hardcore as it might be a little easy towards the end when you are an all-powerful assassin. Two things that stopped me giving it a top score; 1) A few minor glitches that I found a little annoying at some points2) I found myself playing a lot of the levels constantly with dark vision enabled which detracts from the amount of visual detail that this game has.Bought during the steam sale I can't believe the value for money I got here! Would recommend anyone to pay full price as it is AWESOME! Now to go back and find the coins I missed... "

												[Full review of Dishonored]Graphics:So texture quality was one of the main complaints that I heard about Dishonored after its release and I'd have to agree as many textures do appear to be low in quality up close. However, this doesn't detract from overall look of the dirty, grimy city, which I found to be appropriately atmospheric. The entire game is also done in a watercolor painting style which I found to be interesting and ultimately preferable to the ""ultra-realistic"" look that they could've gone with. - 8/10Audio:There wasn't much background music but it wasn't really necessary so I'll give it a pass. The title screen music does add to the ambiance though. Voice acting is spot on in my opinion, especially that of the ominous, all-seeing heart that Corvo carries around as well as the Outsider's. Honorable mentions would have to be Granny Rag's voice acting and Emily's who is, of course, performed by the very talented, Chloë Grace Moretz. It is worth mentioning that Corvo is a silent protagonist which I prefer but am aware that many others do not. Sound effects are also spot on and background conversations add to the overall atmosphere. - 9/10Gameplay:Dishonored introduces many new stealth mechanics that I found to be very original and unique when compared to other titles in the genre. The supernatural element of the story allows for Corvo to possess various powers which are all upgradeable and allow for very different playstyles. Speaking of playstyles, you are given the choice between playing lethally (high chaos) or stealthily (low chaos). Both have their pros and cons but it is clear that the developers meant for players to play stealthily as that is where most of the content is. Combat is nothing special but this is a stealth game so ideally you'll never even engage in combat. There are also numerous side quests which I found to be mostly interesting and worth doing. The open sandbox level designs also allow for hours of exploration. - 10/10Story:Nothing too original but I personally loved it. The supernatural element that the Outsider adds is what really makes the story engaging and unique but the base story about revenge and political corruption is good enough on its own. Between Emily and the plague there was always plenty of motivation to complete the missions and continue through the story, though I would have to agree with other gamers when I say that the ""twist"" at the end was completely predictable. Shouldn't detract too much from the overall story though. - 8/10Replayability:As I said before, you can choose between a high chaos or low chaos playthrough which in itself warrants at least 2 playthroughs. There are also a couple of different sides to choose in the side quests and MANY different ways to go about incapacitating or killing your targets. I've personally completed 4 playthroughs and will probably complete another before the release of Dishonored 2. - 10/10Overall:Overall I have only small complaints - nitpicks, if you will; textures are low quality up close, ending is unoriginal, and the game is a bit on the short side. However, there is no doubt that I have gotten my money's worth as I have enjoyed over 100 hours of gameplay over multiple platforms. The DLC are well worth it as well. - 9/10			"

												Dishonored Many people, and I admit that I, myself am guilty of such, have begun to measure the value of games by the amount of time that can be taken from it. This, mathematical, rash and inadequate evaluation may be blamed on the explosive success of ceertain open-ended titles such as several MMOs, competitive multiplayer game and most certainly the explosive success of the ""Elder scrolls"" series. However, there are certain games that must be seen as what they are: a grand and majestic experience compiled into a small amount of time. Dishonored is that experience, it took me 30 hours to finish a completionist run on the hardest difficulty, since there are two possible ends, this can be increased to 40-50 hours (considering much of my time was spent either reloading retrying due to difficulty, cursing at the fact I forgot to press F5 and hunting achievements that carry throughout different playthroughs). Dishonored is not only a lovely game play experience, but an absolutely necessary narrative, no gamer who calls himself a story-line driven man can claim to be so without having played this game: it is narrative genius and yet another example why people who claim video games are not art are quite frankly morons. The story-line is deep and metaphorical, it is graphically stylized and the soundtrack is as depressive as the streets of Dunwall claim to be. An absolutely genius game that deserves to endure in the mind of it's players for eons to come, bravo, Arkane!			"

												SUMMARYAmazing blend of stealth and action, with an interesting steampunk universe to explore and loot and an amazing art style from the designers that brought you City 17. THE GOOD-Cool and useful powers for the player to use-Multiple playthrough options and strategies-RPG-lite leveling of skills and inventory to make Corvo a better assassin-Environments are amazing, and a joy to explore-Music is foreboding, and the atmosphere is dripping with styleTHE BAD-The guards repeat a lot of their dialogue throughout the game. It's kind of charming, in a way.-Not the most difficult stealth gameplay once you get used to the game's features, but it soon becomes a challenge of how to use your skills to maximum effect.I highly recommend this game! Especially worth checking out if it goes on sale. The Daud DLC is very interesting, and shows a lot more of the city of Dunwall and the plots surrounding Corvo.			"

												A glorious game that mixes steampunk, dystopian alternate reality, and witchcraft. There are two ways to play through the game. High Chaos, where you kill lots of people as you go, or Low Chaos, where you try to sneak past without anyone knowing you were there. To get 100% achievements, you'll need to play through the whole game both ways, but this is not a bad thing. It's almost like playing through two different games! The DLCs ""The Knife of Dunwall"" and ""The Brigmore Witches"" add interesting backstory.  I recommend them, if only to make the game not feel too short.I personally disliked the ""Dunwall City Trials"" DLC which is frustrating, button-mashing meant for hummingbirds on crack who enjoy playing the same challenge over and over (With NO saving) until they end up with not only a perfect run but also a natural 20 on the random game config. To me, the City Trials DLC is not only a waste of time and money, but also added steam achievements that I'll never get, and therefore, no ""perfect game"" for me!			"

												""Leave him to the hungry rats for dinner...""Dishonored brings to the table what i've been longing for all this time in terms of freedom in video games, after New Vegas that is. The rat plague is rampant and Corvo Attano has been sent by the empress Jessamine Kaldwin to search for aid, only that his return was everything but expected. Now the empress is dead and Corvo needs to clear his name and free Emily and put her on the throne. The setting, the spine-chilling music, and the sort of cartoony graphics all come together to bring alive the dead city of Dunwall(hehe), really some scenarios made me cry at what the rat plague has done, dead carcasses and weepers all roam the city while the Lord Regent lives on his suite up Dunwall Tower. The setting and story are good but the gameplay is where we're at. You have the freedom of any Bethesda game in your hands, for example is that person looking you the wrong way? Smash him with a brick or turn him to ashes via Wall of Light(essentialy a wall of elettricity), i kept a save just to screw around and try to kill people in numerous ways. There is also freedom on what is your approach to the key assassination target, do you want to go to the rooftops, sewers, windows, near building? you can and the game rewards you for it instead of punishing you by not going to the designed way. The keyword here is ""freedom"" and really i felt like Corvo while playing it. The things i disliked about this game were the powers, if i'm allowed to say, they were a bit OP. Really you can complete the game with only Blink and that power alone gives you an enormous advantage and the upgrades were minimum and i finished the game with a stack of unused runes. Overrall this game was a frickin' treat and i despise myself for not trying it earlier.Vote: 8/10			"

												An excellent example of stealth offering multiple routes, interesting characters and incredibly fluid gameplay really make this game shine. Bethesda know's how to pick 'em....er, usually. The game itself is short...if you go guns blazing at least. Otherwise, it'll take a long while to beat. Overall, I can't think of anything negative about it aside from the lack of information about the world. Buy it if possible, you'll get your money's worth, on sale or not.			"

												After finishing the main campaign twice, as well as both story DLC, for a total of almost 36 hours of gameplay I can absolutely recommend this game. You can play through stealthily or full combat, and some missions have multiple possible solutions for eliminating or neutralizing your target. The story is interesting and has a couple of plot twists along the way. The combat as well as powers are fun and have a good feel to them. For anyone who wants a fun, stealthy, story driven FPS I highly recommend Dishonored as well as the two story based DLCs. The only real knock against the game is the graphics. You can tell that they were aiming to perform well on the 360 and PS3, and the PC version wasn't made to be much more pretty than the consoles. The good side of this is that the game will run well on high settings even for people with modestly powerful PCs.			"

												The game seems impossible (or damn close to it) without powers, due to the actually-fairly-good AI and their uncanny nack for looking in all the right places, so your prison escape is usually the most difficult part. Aside from that, the game seems to have a lot of emphasis on ""let's count the ways you can commit mass murder"" for a game that has a pseudo-morality system, the graphics and aesthetic are very nice (if just a combination of Bioshock's aesthetic and Half-Life 2's aesthetic), the gameplay holds up well until the absolute last bit of the absolute last level (where the guards are combination of immovable and clueless, for reasons I can't come up with), there are a fair number of powers but not enough runes to go around and not enough powers that can be used non-lethally (most of them focus on lethality or cause needless death when used), and the audio is very nice.Overall I give it a 4/5 (would recommend if it's $10-15, MAYBE $20), and it could be made absolutely perfect with modding. Personally I've had my fill of the game's mechanics (which for me, boil down to ""blink behind guard, choke guard, hide guard, don't get caught, ad nauseum""), so I'd skip the DLCs.			"

												Dishonored's gameplay is very much its strongest suit. It offers challenging, intelligent level design which demands the player use all the tools acquired in shrewd ways in order to succeed. The game is aware that in stealth gameplay, satisfaction arises from a feeling of overcoming obstacles using thought, not brute force; playing Dishonored guns blazing (or sword drawn) is usually a recipe for death unless facing few opponents. And besides, most of the collectables and interesting locales are reached by stealth and ingenuity when it comes to moving around the level. Yet the combat in Dishonored does not suffer, as sword fighting is engaging and tactical, and the side weapons are always fun to play with. The variety of methods one can use to play through Dishonored give the game great replay value, made greater by the possibility of investing in different upgrades and the inclusion of different endings depending on the player's actions during the game.Story is weaker in Dishonored. While the setting is rich and compelling, and the overarching narrative is decent, the plot feels stilted because of the disconnected levels. After some time the plot feels like a way to justify the missions rather than the two working in tandem to add depth to the game's events; it feels artificial. Similarly the system of ""chaos"" in which many killings lead to darker story events and a more chaotic city feels arbitrary at times as the game does little to justify the changes to the city. However it is commendable that a game should make the player consider the ideas of killing, revenge, the value of life, and to what extent ends justify means. It's no philosophical powerhouse, but it touches on interesting topics.All in all, Dishonored is worth the money and the time. Despite some plot related weaknesses the game is great fun and requires thought and care to play through, whether sneaking about or crossing swords with the enemy.			"

												Decent enough game, but basically Deus Ex for consoletards meets Bioshock. AI is pretty dumb and won't be alerted even if they look in your direction but just so happen to be far away. Also there's not enough variation in gameplay for a non lethal playthrough - you end up just using the sleep darts as a weapon and the usual sneak up from behind takedowns. Some gas grenades would've been nice at a minimum.Overall I'd say a 7/10. Not GOTY material because it really is babby's first stealth game and typical console port (viewmodel FOV is lol). Play Deus Ex or Thief if you want a more challenging/enjoyable experience.			"

												For many years Thief series was one of my favourite games of all times. After the third game, which was slightly worse than second one, I was waiting for a new game done in the similar fashon. And for many years there was nothing out there. And then came Dishonored. The game so good that now I prefer it over Thief. The game I've finished five times already and will probably do few more runs. The game that lets you choose a style of play - you can be a shadow, you can be a tank, you can be an invisible predator. You can eachieve your goals in many ways, you can finish a game without hurting anyone or you can kill everyone you see moving. A steampunk world of Dunwall is also interesting and the only problem I see in this game is that it's short. It comes with two brilliant DLCs thought (Knife of Dunwall and The Brightmore Witches) and a mediocre one (Dunwall City Trials). Overall, this game is high on my Top 10 list of games of all times.

												This game is great. It's a tonne of fun and I recommend it to anyone who likes stealth games. The only problem I have with this game is that killing everyone and your targets gets you a bad ending and doing everything the non lethal way gets you a good ending. This would be fine if the game didn't seem to be so tailored to you killing people. While there's a million different way to kill targets (And it's probably not lot more fun if you get creative) there's only a couple of ways to non-lethally dispatch enemies, sleep darts and choking them, rendering most powers and upgrades almost useless. This doesn't stop the game from being hella fun though, so buy it.8/10			"

												Looking back at Dishonored: One of the best stealth games I had ever played. Try not to abuse the quick save system. Other than that, this game is a pretty good ""assassin simulator"". It's also pretty good for a first person point of view. Knowing that Dishonored 2 is currently in development (as I am writing this review) makes me happy. My review when the game was still fresh in my head 2 years ago:[A really awesome, if not probably the best assassin game you will ever play. You can either play on two paths: Non-lethality, which means you will have to use stealth most of the time and choke your enemies to death OR; Lethality, which means killing EVERYONE because it is awesome. The combat of the game is great! And you have really cool powers so use them to your advantage. This game really makes you feel like an assassin. Okay maybe thats the sole purpose of assassin games, but killing key targets are pretty fun. Time would slow down a bit and music would play as you kill key targets with your blade, whether it is a stab from behind or a full-out frontal assault. A few downsides of the game are namely 1. How they poorly introduce you to Lady Emily, the daughter of the Empress, 2. The eyes of the characters dont really show any expression, they blink but they dont really change, and lastly 3. You will have a ""bossfight"" later in the game, but it was so easy I dont think it's a boss fight. Overall great game. I dont care about the downsides I just mentioned. It's 10/10]			"

												'Dishonored' is a first person stealth rpg game in a steampunk setting with an awesome storyline.First you have to know: The game is published by Bethesda! (Bethesda RPGs are always excellent IMO)You play as Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles, who gets in contact with the Outsider. You level Corvo by collecting runes. Corvo has six active and four passive powers:Active: Dark Vision, Blink, Possession, Devouring Swarm, Bend Time and Wind BlastPassive: Agility, Blood Thirsty, Shadow Kill, VitalityNone of these powers are pointless! You can play Corvo as YOU like to play the game:For example::: Killing slyly out of the shadows by using Blink/Bend Time and Shadow Kill/Blood Thirsty:: Playing non-lethal by using Blink/Possession and Agility:: Being Rambo by using Devouring Swarm/Wind Blast and Vitality/Blood Thirsty:: etc.Pros:+ Awesome sound on vision+ Imaginative abilities + None of the abilities are pointless.+ Excellent storyline+ High replayability+ Smooth course of the game(+ Brilliant DLCs; except ""City Trials"")(+ ""Easy"" collectable achievements)Cons:- not lip-sync- less hostile NPCs- unimaginative weapons (sword, pistol, grenades, mines)(- Graphics are not up to date)Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because of the great storyline and the excellent game mechanics.9/10 "

												Before i got this game i was a little suspicious if it was really as good as ive heard. In fact i first heared of this game from a friend who was shocked that i didnt even know the title much less the plot. He verbally abused me for the rest of that day. Some months later i was looking through a game article of the ""best pc games out there that you can buy bla bla bla"" i went through the list and recognized this game and thought back to my friends ridicules. But im not one to impulsivly buy things unless they are cheap and on sale. People tell me im a jew with my money, those people are racist. Anyway, i scoured the internet looking at reviews, ign's thoughts, and some articles on the game because even though its only 10 bucks which is a amazing deal for this game, i still wanted to make sure i was getting my moneys worth. And the verdict is... ♥♥♥♥ yes. This game is by far one of the most interesting, story/stealth/action titles i have EVER laid my eyes on and i play a lot of games. Im new to PC gaming but this experience is really broadening my view. If you have any secound thoughts, maybe graphics, or if its ""fun"" because if your like me those are the only 2 things that really matter, let me assure you. ITS VERY VERY VERY FUN. youll be hooked for hours and there are so many options. I suggest playing the first couple missions, get a feel of the game then immidently starting over and playing with a little experience on your back. Anyway, get this game if your even just feeling like you want it, you will not regret it, i mean♥♥♥♥♥♥look at the damn positive V negitive. That should be proof enough that this is a dope game. 10/10 experience.			"

												I usually only write reviews for the best games in my library, and Dishonored is no exception. At the time of writing this review, I've completed the game and all of its DLCs twice; high chaos and low chaos. Pros The game is designed with every possible playstyle in mind, shown especially through the level design. There's pipes on the sides of buildings, ledges, hidden secrets and plenty to explore. Want to sneak past all of the guards? Easy, just blink between ledges on buildings, over walls, and onto streetlights. Want to kill absolutely everything? No problem, just whip out your trusty pistol/crossbow/otherworldly-tool-of-destruction and blast away at the guards on the street, or maybe grab some whale oil tanks and start exploding things. The gameplay is smooth and phenomenal all throughout.The game is pretty old, but the graphics (or art style, more like) still look pretty good. There's some nice bloom/light shaft effects, and the game doesn't try too hard to look realistic, just pleasant to look at. The closest thing I can compare it to is Borderlands, minus the harsh black lines on everything.There's a hell of a lot of creativity and freedom when it comes to playing the missions. For example, let's say there's five guards in a room. You could throw a grenade in, stop time, and shoot the grenade midair with a crossbow bolt. On the other hand, you could simply blast everyone with a gust of wind, and finish off anyone who didn't die when they hit the wall.This game can run on a potato. Cons The story isn't bad, but it's not great either. You're the royal guard of the Empress, she gets killed in front of you, other government-people rush in and frame you for it. There's that.For new players, there is a bit of trial and error for certain things. This can be a pro or a con, depending on who you ask, but here's some help with that; you can't blink through a Wall of Light. Arc Pylons aren't so dangerous if you're above them or below them. That should save you a couple of deaths if you're new.Not much else in the cons department. Conclusion 9/10, only wish the game could've been a bit longer (there's 9 missions in the main game, give or take 5-6 hours if you know what you're doing). "

												Dishonored is like if you took Deus Ex's attention to detail, wide-open gameplay choices, and wealth of world-building, and mixed it with Thief's stealth and setting. It's a game where you can play through it entirely without ever being spotted or killing anyone, or you can run through and murder everybody and both choices are equally valid and fun. You can play through it and get the basic story, or you can dig into every book, note, and mind-read and get as much detail on the city of Dunwall and the people who inhabit it as you want. It's fantastic. The stealth is not too skittish or completely dim. the action and movement feel great, which is an area Arkane always does well in. Everything is stylized more than super-technically impressive, but it all looks good. You should get Dishonored if you're into Deus Ex, or Thief, if you like action or stealth games, or if you're into games lots of lore. And while you're at it, get The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches DLC, because they add a sidestory involving characters from the main game. It tweaks some abilities, adds new equipment, it's about 2/3rds as long as the base game, and it's also great!			"

												So, this is probably the best game i have played in a while. The story is good and the gameplay is tight. My first playthrough of the game took around 10 hours, but i´m definately returning to try out different approches. While maybe a tiny bit predictable, the story is deep and succeeds in creating a living, vibrant world. Combined with level design that trumps anything i have ever seen before, and an interesting array of different mechanics, Dishonored ends up delivering way over my expectations. I´m left with a melancholic feeling, and i don´t even know why. I guess it´s just the general mood of the game that got to me.  9,8/10Remember, killing wont always solve your problems...			"

												Dishonored is, without a doubt, my favorite stealth game ever. More than Metal Gear and more than Deus Ex. You are Corvo, the royal protector who was framed for the murder of the empress. You must then take your revenge on those who framed you with the help of magic from the Outsider and gadgets from Piero to aid you in your stealthing.One of the main reasons I love this game so much is player choice. My playtime reflects that you can play the game more than once. If you're playing it once you aren't doing it right. At the shortest, you can play the whole game excluding the even shorter DLCs in about ten hours. However, the game offers many ways to play it through multiple times. In this regard, Dishonored is like an RPG. To compare to Fallout, another Bethesda game, my first run in both games is what I would do. In Fallout, I would side with the good guys (mostly) and be mostly nice. In Dishonored, I would use as much magic as I could, get as many runes as possible, not kill many people (murder wasn't out of the question though) and do other things I won't get into for spoilers' sake. I played a female psychopath in Fallout next, and in Dishonored I got all three achiemements for not killing anyone. You can play the whole game without killing anyone and in the sequel, you can do the whole game without magic. Speaking of the magic, it's a great thing to put into a stealth game. In games like Metal Gear, it focuses on raw stealth in which you use distractions and funny looking diving to sneak about. With magic, you augment your sneaking so it becomes easier and more fun. It's optional however, except the first tier of blink. With blink, you can teleport a short distance to reach high places or traverse crowded streets faster. There is also dark vision that lets you see through walls. All of these powers make the game a very fun escape from traditional stealth games. Along with these powers, you get bone charms that add passives. To get this magic you have to collect runes and bone charms. These are often placed off the beaten path and finding them leads you into interesting sidequests and cool lore to find. The game is rich in lore. Books are everywhere and audiologs explain a lot of things. You will learn about the seven scriptures of the overseers and why they name the months like month of nets. These sidequests and alternate pathways are different each time you play. If you seek runes early in the game, someone will ask you to poison a bootleg elixr distillery, and in the very next level, you are recruited by the person you ruined to do something. With a story rich universe and fun mechanics and player choice, Dishonored is a must play for fans of stealth and story.			"

												A game that has a lot of positives - replayable value(you get to choose your style of play violent or non-violent), bioshock-like feel (which is always a plus), atmosphere and architecture because of the same engine that both games share and some collaborations involved between studios, a fitting soundtrack that perfectly sets the mood, gory yet awesomely crafted fighting scenes to make this game even more enticing. The biggest issue that everyone had was the generic storyline, which doesnt have a lot of twists and turns and just blatantly forces you to not care about anything that is happening while simply enjoying the entertainment that this game provides in its action packed gameplay; you are just a man on a mission that seeks revenge, nothing extraordinary. But I must say, the DLC's were a refreshing gulp, since you get a chance to play from a different perspective through another person and his journey, that certainly gets you more involved in his struggles and road to redemption. Unlike in the original, the protagonist in the DLC actually has his own voice this time and a new array of tricks and gadgets. You can talk about this game forever, but all I can it has been a very enjoyable game that has a lot to offer, and since i've completed the high chaos, which is the violent way, I will indulge myself into the stealth side of this game. Dark, gory, visually beautiful and breathtaking game that holds its position strong as one of my favorites games to date.			"

												Dishonored is the game that made me fall in love with games again. It's visually stunning - the lighting, the textures, the character design - is painterly and beautiful and utterly grotesque. Dunwall is a living, breathing city - or, it was. Wheezing a bit by the time your story really begins, but that's what draws you in. There are many creative ways to ruthlessly murder people if that's what you're in to, or so many secret passages to sneak past everyone un-noticed - and maybe pick up a bit of info as well.All of the characters have hidden depths, even the City Watch grunts and plague-ridden zombies. Scary and pretty and really very good.Also, pick up the story-based DLC (The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches) for more of the same, in some places better than the main game - bigger maps and more decisions and awesome lady characters, please and thank.

												It's not a bad game, it certainly shows a lot of potential, but falls short in some aspects. The story is a little clichè and a little short, I finished it in 17 hours on hard without killing anyone or being spotted, getting the low chaos ending, I couldn't pull myself trough another gameplay to see the high chaos ending, maybe someday. Usually you get multiple ways of infiltrating and disposing of your target, but when you aim for perfection the game becomes quite linear, especially in the non lethal part, but there is still some fair choice involved, especially in the infiltration, with you being able to blink almost where you want, possess an animal, a person, stop time, etc. The powers are nice and original, as I said the posess ability can open new paths, you can pass check points as guards or get inside some small holes as a rat. I like the setting, which is trying to give you the steam punk vibe but not always succeeds, and sometimes it's more post apocalyptic, yes the general ""lore"" is definitely nice and interesting, like the weepers. I say this is a nice game, but nowhere near the best of the year or the best assassination one. In short, good fun for the first playthrough, but definitely overrated.			"

												Dishonored is an amazing game, simple as that. It allows a player to do as he or she wishes, while effecting how the game will end. You may play super stealthy, or go through the game kicking♥♥♥♥♥ it is up to you. You don’t even have to kill anyone if you don’t want to, I did this on my second play through to find that there were less infected people. The ending was a little.. well meh, but I enjoyed getting there. The “wail punk” world was immersive and pretty. The world being powered by whale oil is original and clever.

Game mechanics are good and I didn't notice any bugs through my gameplay. Only thing I might question is the balance of the ""Chaos"" system in the game, that defines the ending and some things in the world as you go closer to end, as it seems that if you for example kill more enemies at the beginning of the game you cannot fix the situation later on the game by completing the levels by not killing anyone.

												A game like Bioshock (the two good ones at least), this game has a rich story accompanied by incredable stealth and combat mechanics.  Never before have I experienced the feeling of being a legitament badass assassin.In the game, you play as a man, Corvo, framed for murdering the Empress and hiding away Emily, her beloved daughter, your are tried and sentenced to death.  However, you escape with the help of a small group dedicated to helping you.  They know the truth about you.Following after your escape, you act as an assassin, taking out targets and completing missions.  Each mission is very flexible, for you can play through and complete them in many ways.  There WILL be a way you can fit your playstyle in this game.  Additionally, those who would rather take the role of a stealthy(er) assassin, may find much enjoyment from sneaking around and taking out or incapacitating targets.The only issue I have with this game is Chaos, a mechanic that limits the player being at least this stealthy.  For example, killing too many will make your allies act differently toward you, and changing the overall game environment.  While it is arguable that this mechanic makes the game better by adding more challenges, I find it a bit of a pain because the thought of it pops in your head if you ever choose to kill a guard or something.Overall 9/10, worth getting (like Bioshock), especially when on sale.

Find different paths to the target, sometimes in water, sometimes on the roof. The battle system is great, and the magics are awesome. DLCs forced player to get familiar with every skill, even when you didn't use it in your main playthrough. The knife oif Dunwall and Brigmore wiches offered player a different view of Dunwall city, and made Daud, one of the most tough enemies in the main game, alive. Now all I'm doing is waiting for Dishonored II to come out, if Bethesda and Arkane are planning to make one.			"

												115 hours. That's for a single player game. This does not include the 50+ hours spent on Xbox.If you've heard anything about dishonored, it's probably that the game not only excells in Replayability, but the technicality of system itself. To start off:1) The gameplay is as versatile as it gets, AND retains it's balance. Dishonored can essentially be played in 4 different ways: Letal ghost, Letal loud, Non-lethal ghost, non-lethal loud. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! While those are the base ways you can play the game, and despite it being a linear map, the path from start to end for each level is anything but restriced. For instance, there's a path ahead of you into the stronghold. Sure, you can charge in through the front door guns and abilities blazing, or you could climb the buildings besides it to get to the roof and through a window. Oh, but you can of course posess a guard to get past a checkpoint, or posess a rat to go in through a ventilation pipe. What's that? want more? There's a locked door just on the side. Either sneak to the guard checkpoint to get a key, or blast the door down with a grenade. And YES, there's more ways than just that to get inside!2) The level design is phenominal in terms of being versatile, as it isn't messy in the slightest. Say you max out your agility and teleport, well, you might find that you can climb certain ledges that you couldn't normally. The great thing about this is that it doesn't feel like you improvise much to get to these places. It's not hard to guess how to get up to certain places if you take a couple seconds to look around. But it isn't in-your-face obvious either. It's almost like Mirrors edge in terms of platforming and traveling like that.3) The maps are huge, considering that it's a single load at a time, no need to reload partways through the level. Now, this in itself isnt that big of a deal, what the great thing is, is that the game doesn't need a high end PC to run it well. Bethedsa has made a game that works brilliantly, and is nearly as efficent as the source engine.4) The art detail. This is probably the best steampunk based game I've played, and I'm not really that big on steampunk. But these guys got the art director from Half Life 2 on this, and he implemented both a unique, abstract, and despite it's water color, a believeable fictional universe. Oh, and while you can't see it from the screenshots, you get to go to a certain abstract world that I dare not spoil here. Needless to say, it's incredibly refreshing and new in a way.5) The replayability. Play through this game on stealth? That's cool, so did I. Now, how about you give it another go with guns and arrows out and see how you fare. Seriously, it feels like a new game when you switch it up like that. I've easily played throught the campaign 5-6 times for both fun and for achievements, and I will keep going for a while I imagine. I hadn't even found this much fun in replayability in Deus Ex Human Revolution, and that game in itself is fantastic too.So, If this poorly written review hasn't compelled you, then please look at the 100+ game of the year awards. Unless youe looking for a non-FPS game or one that is specifically focused on guns, Dishonored is a must own and a must play.10/10			"

												Dishonored is honestly one of the best games I've played up there with Halo 2. It has an amazing story that changes with your actions (which adds some replayablity) and an amazing steampunk aesthetic. It has an original and unpridictable storyline (which I advise that you don't watch any walkthroughs or cutscenes before playing the game) and a lot of freedom when it comes to doing missions. Overall 10/10 ign			"

												Gameplay-The game as a game is great! Story mode is really good and interesting, I prefer to buy it because you will miss a really good product from Bethesda Softwork , I can't say the best because here are DOOM, Fallout and Wolfenstein. Back to gameplay, which is really skillfull and full of choices which will apear as result in future. I noticed that game is full of sotry books and notes which can be useful in game too. There is also a many type of weapons and powers u can use, for all of theme there is always at start menu ,TUTORIALS, which clear explaning what weapon,power,granade do.If you once play it and you find that you realy play good game and you wanna again, write some guides because I am interested in shortcuts, no time to play much. If you found this useful please like share and most important enjoy in game.			"

												Oh well honor for all, oh the big and the small,The taller they stand, the harder they fall.We live for today but we die for the next.With blood in our veins and the air in our chests,we step into war with our hearts on the line.The dirt on our boots it shakes free over time.The music fades, the violin slows.The darkness rises as the sun goes.Love is a distant aroma at best,A withering smile that's stuffed deep in your vest.The night air it wraps its fingers around.Your body shakes from a now distant sound.Oh the sound of her voice, a sweet symphony,Played over and over until you are free.The music fades, the violin slows.The darkness rises, as the sun goes.Can you feel the new day rising,Climbing up the east horizon?They can't hold us down we'll fight through.Each and everyone to start new.Well, we shall not stumble no we shall not fall.We shall not crumble we shall stand tall.Death will come as sure as the night.But we will run no, we live but to fight.With blood on our hands and dirt on our knees,We tear at the ones who brought the disease.The music fades, the violin slows.The darkness rises as the sun goes.Can you feel the new day rising?Climbing up the east horizon...They can't hold us down we'll fight through.Each and everyone will start new...

												this game is fun. this is a game with soooo many options like do i go stealth or do i just shoot everyone with a gun, do i move the body or do i kill this guard before he discouvers it. this game has really good replay value because every mission can be replayed and most of the time you try to go total stealth but it is hard. At times you feel like a total badass. you have powers and you get to choose wich powers you get. the main power you have is one called blink it basicly enables you to teleport a short distance (you can blink behind a guard kill him and retreat to a safe distance). the main question in this game that you ask yourself is will i be the mater assassin or will i be the ultimite soldier.

I have over a hundred hours playing this game going back, getting all of the runes and bone charms, looking for things I missed the first time, and also playing the two amazing dlcs that put you in the shoes of the assassin who killed the emperess, Daud.

												I can't believe I missed out for this long. One of the best game of all time in my opinion. Brutal, engaging adventure, in a chaotic city, dying at the hands of corrupt governants, and deadly diseases. Also, this game has an amazing artwork. Has a Huge re-play value, and the game world will react differently to your (Corvo) actions, and play-style. Totally worth the price. Corvo is a very likeable character, the same applies to all others, who you will constantly meet, throughout your adventures, and miss them a lot, when, they are gone. I can say that this is the best game i've played so far.			"

												Different from ANY GAME I'VE PLAYED! This game is fantastic and holds on to the GOTY title with a vice. The game itself is packed-full of stealth and assasination style gameplay; and is overall very fun. The graphics are beautiful, from every alley to sewage pipe. This game gives you OPTIONS that change how the game plays and how different characters react to your actions; which is a rare occurance in games. The price tag is fair for this good of a game, and if you can get it on sale it would be a steal. I haven't played any of the DLC missions but from what I've heard, they are quite good. So pick up Dishonored; a game different from anything else.			"

Raises far above the average with a good mix of storytelling, strong art style and the ability to transition back and forth between the stealth and shooting parts.I loved it how the story keeps it in the middle (at least for a while) whether some of the involved characters (including yourself) are ""good"" or ""bad"", how some of the twists are foreshadowed and how some hit you like a hammer.

												This game is extremely well done. There aren't many good stealth games on the market, but this one takes the cake. The ""blink"" mechanic makes this my favorite stealth game. The ability to look all around the environment and find a location to ""blink"" to is tons of fun. The decisions you make massively affect many things in this game, from the environment to the story outcome. This game also has wonderful replayability with multiple endings and all sorts of difficult objectives and playstyles. The $20 the game currently sells for is a steal, but on sale its even better. -PR0XIDIAN			"

												Easily one of the best stealth games I've ever played, and certainly the best first-person stealth game since Thief: The Dark Project first hit the scene in '98. In fact, Dishonored (sic) is almost excessively reminiscent of Thief, taking on a similar steampunk aesthetic although Thief's steampunk was of a more dark ages/medieval flavour than Dishonored's victorian stylings.The painted textures are very pleasing to the eye, the stealth mechanics are superb and the plot is interesting. The only issue is the morality system which causes characters unfavourably to you (down to calling you a -monster-) if you kill too many of the vicious, petty and murderous guards. This, of course, is irrespective of whether you killed them purposefully or due to knocking over a potted plant and having them run headfirst onto your sword. I've always been annoyed at how stealth games will give you one or two dull ways of non-lethally neutralizing enemies while giving you dozens upon dozens of amusing ways to kill them - and then give you the 'bad' ending if you use them. A game should not punish a player for enjoying themselves.But this is a minor quibble, the ""bad"" ending isn't that bad. It's still an excellent game and if the pooch finds itself thoroughly screwed with regards to Thief 4, at least we'll always have Dishonored (sic).			"

												I lost count of how many times I've played through this game. I love it, and for so many reasons: plot, gameplay, and replayability, to name a few.First off, the plot it actually very deep. If you're not looking for details you could easily miss it, but when you pay attention you find out all sorts of things. Arkane added a lot of depth to the story to make it more engaging, and even hid a few Easter eggs for players to find (for instance, you can find High Overseer Campbell as a weeper in the Flooded District if you elect to brand him instead of kill him earlier in the game). It's the small things that count: notes and journals that give you a glimpse into life in plague-ridden Dunwall; overhearing conversations between characters, even minor ones; hearing the experienced assassin Daud's lament over killing the Empress. Playing this game and taking the time to scour the maps for clues that reveal plot is one of the more fun and engaging things to do, even if you've finished your first playthrough.Second, gameplay. Ohhhh my, the gameplay. Even without magical powers, the gameplay is fun and there's always someone to stalk and assassinate (or choke out and hide, if that's your style). Drop assassinations never get old, and neither does taking out a Tallboy or taunting guards through an electric field that you rewired (the poor sods). But adding Blink to the party, not to mention the rest of the supernatural abilities, was the cherry on top. Allowing you the ability to do so many things, from moving silently across an open space without notice to appearing in front of an enemy and killing them before they could so much as blink (heh heh), the Blink ability increased the gameplay experience by an order of magnitude.Some gameplay factors also increased the replay value of the game, namely those factors allowing you to choose between options. You get to experiment with so many different ways to take out a target, and if you want to spare his life, there's a way to do that too. Maybe you liked sneaking around on the ground but would like to jump on rooftops more. Do more side quests that you overlooked on other playthroughs. I even knew a guy who did a playthrough that he called ""Extreme Non-Lethal,"" where he went undetected and only choked out the targets he absolutely had to, focusing on finding ways to slip past without being noticed. Even though the game is linear, you are still allowed enough options to permit multiple creative plays of the game, as I have done.It is worth mentioning the game that Dishonored took its notes from, which is Thief: The Dark Project. I am happy to say that Arkane was kind enough to put in an Easter egg in the game in acknowledgement of their inspiration. This can be found in Daud's base, when you stumble across two assassins training for stealth; the dialogue from that scene is taken from Thief: The Dark Project almost verbatim.TL;DR - I found Dishonored to be a very enjoyable game, and I recommend it to anyone who has a love for games featuring stealth or stabbing (don't tell my psychiatrist). It has good graphics, great gameplay, commendable replayability (especially for a single-player game), and an in-depth plot to boot.			"
