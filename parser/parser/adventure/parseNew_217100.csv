												Dementium 2 is (in my opinion) an oustanding AAA horror title for Nintendo DS users.  Bringing this game to PC and trying to uphold that reputation is no easy feat.  However, Dementium II HD does fairly good job at its redention of the DS horror classic.4/5 Controls: With average customizability and controller support, the game offers industry standard customizations (i.e. sensitivity, key mapping, etc.)4.5 /5 Graphics: Trying to hold true to the DS roots, the game presents very minimalisitic graphics (you won't need a GTX 680 anytime soon to play this at 60 fps) which do add to the quality of the game (In my opinion lower quality graphics tend to lean towards a more scary experience).  What they've done was revamped the qualtity acceptable enough for current PC users.4/5 Story: If you've played the DS version there's nothing new for you here.  Crazy doctor, his wierd experiments, main character is in a mental hospital, its pretty self explanatory but it creates a good basis for a horror game.4/5 Gameplay: Controls in horror games differ tremeandously, with each game trying to seperate itself from the others; Dementium II HD is no exception to this trend.  You're provided a standard PC FPS experience however the combat does vary slightly from other FPS genres (i.e. The guns' crosshair has some lag to it when turning making aiming a little more challenging)4/5 Music: The remastered and newly scored music for the HD release is quite a nostalgic experience to that of the DS version.  The music could be cut out here and there to give the atmosphere of the game a darker and lonelier feeling.At the moment there are some glitches here and there but nothing you wouldn't expect in a game's first release.In all, there's no reason you shouldn't be happy with spending $15 on this game considering its current status.There's much to be ammended in the game before its a perfect port of the DS version (I would have been happy with a port of the DS version with just the addition of PC controls).In all this game deserves a 4/5 (not averaged).It's shy of amazing, but you won't be slamming your head on the desk wondering why you bought it in the first place.

												Dementium II was a Nintendo DS FPS-Horror game, sequel to Dementium: The Ward. I never played either of them, so I can't say how this compares to the original, but I can say a general opinion on the title, and how it stands on the Steam market.Firstly, you'll have to acknowledge its DS origins to understand some of the design decisions in the game. The combat is somewhat simplistic for a FPS. Enemies do react to being hit in certain spots more than others, but it feels somewhat simplified. The beginning enemies especially are noticeable as you start the game with just a knife, and the first few are pretty simplistic (enemies that just try to approach you and hit you with a melee attack). How you attack, how the enemies react... It all has a very handheld feel to it, combined that most objects in the environment have simple geometry and some of the textures are kind of low. Not a terrible looking game, but it does look a bit dated. The graphics have been completely reworked for the HD version, but it mainly tries to update them rather than fully modernize them.The audio also is notciable just upgraded DS tunes as well. The music is not bad, there's actually some very nice songs in the collection, but it sounds like Silent Hill 1-level quality. Also, the game has a bad habit of making a certain battle theme playing when enemies are near. It isn't TOO repetitive, but you will hear the song a number of times before the game is up. But the sounds can be pretty competent to fit the mood.But the game does a good job at slowly but surely introducing new elements and enemies to keep things interesting. The enemies are surprisingly varied, and new ones keep on getting added until the last fourth of the game. I hear the original game had respawning enemies, but that's thankfully not the case here. Enemies don't respawn when backtracking or re-entering a room, which is nice and makes defeating enemies with supplies feel worthwhile. You can run in most instances though if you feel so inclined. Bosses, while not amazing, are pretty good. Definitely not bad, more than serviceable, so yeah, pretty good. And like the normal enemies, they're pretty varied. There's a few puzzles tossed into the mix, no real brain teasers, but they can be fun little distractions, and like other elements, they switch-up the puzzles so you aren't doing too much of the same thing. In fact, I have to applaud the developers on trying to switch things up enough to avoid the game from becoming too repetitive. The locations even are pretty varied and feel different, and even backtracking doesn't really overdo itself. The locations main 'themes' switch between asylum-type levels, nightmare-type levels, and outdoor snowy-type levels, but they each have a different sub-theme and different environments and design. The developers seemed to have found a sweet middleground for making elements familiar, but not treading too much of the same ground to be repetitive. The game isn't scary. Tense sometimes, but the game never really tries to scare you. No scripted scares, no jump scares... Which could be a good thing. The game simply uses audio, and its environment and monsters. The atmosphere can be tense sometimes, and even creepy, but the game possibly relies too much on its combat for itself to really settle in.And that's one thing you'll need to know about Dementium. It is a very action-focused title. While you can run from most encounters, you will be fighting a lot of enemies, with limited supplies, and the monsters are the main focus of the game. There's a total of 10 weapons in the game, and each feels very different, though noticeably you gain five of the game's ten weapons in the last third of the game, and three weapons right in the final chapter, making how they're spread maybe a bit uneven.I'd say it's a good game, not an AMAZING game, but if something that's like a mixture between Doom and Silent Hill interests you, this may be right up your alley. Not a bad game, or a bad remake, I'd give it a solid 6-8 our of 10, but keep in mind its handheld origins definitely show and I did find a few of the game's enemies a bit frustrating, and the combat was pretty simple. Can be a very nostalgic feeling game, if that's what you're looking for.			"

												Needs a fair bit of work.Pros:Somewhat interesting but cliched story.Enemies look freaky.Good atmosphere.Cons:Player movement is slow, even for running.Combat is clunky and awkward.Animations seem stiff and weak.Combat music is monotonous and short.VSync setting not working, at least for me.Port of a DS game.Get only if on a deep discount (50% or more) and you're itching for something new to play in the horror genre.

												This HD version of Dementium 2 is the PC port of a 4-year old Nintendo DS game. That said you can immediately notice the graphics that are not on par with today's PC standards. Also, the gameplay is simple, the controls are a bit non-responsive and the story is not exactly long. You can complete William's story in a mere 3 hours.Still, Dementium 2 can be fun. It is a horror FPS game and you have all the weapons you need in such a game (knife, flamethrower) along with all the monstrosities you expect to jump at you at every corner. During the gameplay you proceed from room to room annihilating mentioned monstrosities while occasionally picking up an object only to use it elsewhere to overcome an obstacle.I like how the game transitions you sometimes - while half of it takes place in a mental institution and in its surrounding village and caves the other half puts you in the same areas but in a hellish, underworld-like environment. One could call it a day and night cycle that is often repeated.Dementium is mediocre at best but a good pastime. If you have nothing on your plate and do not desire to pick your next AAA game up you can have fun with it. Its low price can also get you closer to making this decision.			"

												Dementium II is a game capable of making you cry. Not because its scary, not because the story is rich or you get attached to the characters but because it really is as awful as everyone says it is. Clunky and broken controls, clipping textures and repetitive combat are just three reasons why I wouldn't recommend this even if it were free. Nothing strategic about the boss battles just spam the attack button and make sure you dodge their *special power* and they're beaten. Nothing HD about this either.. graphics are average at best and this game proves to be just another bad port. Sometimes I really hate being a completionist because I have to force myself to play through terrible games like this one. It was honestly painful. Save your money, save your time, save yourself the frustration.. this game is definitely not worth any of it.			"

												Dementium II HD is a Survival-Horror game ported from the Nintendo DS and released for Windows in 2013. It is a sequel to Dementium: The Ward, and expands on the original with more enemies, abilities, weapons etc. Playing Dementium II felt like a cross between Silent Hill and The Evil Within. You switch from a normal environment to some kind of demented horror environment, which overlaps your reality. You play as William Redmoor, who is trapped in a Prison mental health facility and is experiencing waking nightmares. Visually the game isn't as modern looking as The Evil Within, but it's not bad either. It's got some good moments where something jumps out and scares you, or you encounter a monster and have to fight with a knife, but the AI seems rather simple even on harder difficulties. The story is interesting, but drawn out and you get pieces of it at a time. All in all not a bad game for the genre.			"

												Dementium II was originally a game for the Nintendo DS. It is a FPS-Horror game and the sequel to Dementium: The Ward.Dementium II HD does a poor job explaining the details of what is going on. It drops the player inside a sanitarium that is haunted, or something and your job is it to fight through hordes of ghastly monsters and stop the mad doctor behind it all. The combat is simple, but fun. The ability to chose from over eight different weapons in a roughly five hour experience is a solid addition. Enemies are usually slow and repetitious and it is very possible to engage all creatures with the same technique.Dementium II HD comes with a handful of puzzles. Sadly they are there just for the sake of having puzzles and do not bring any real meat into the game.The graphics, are far from optimal for the platform. This game was originally designed for the Nintendo DS and while there have been some improvements made to match PC gaming standards, it still plays like a game built in the early 2000s. Dementium II was probably an amazing DS game but on PC it is a waste of money and time.Sounds 4/10Graphics 3/10Gameplay 3/10Atmosphere 4/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I really didn't get anything from this game. The back and forth item collection of the same areas really shows this used to be a ds game as I imagine the creators had to utilise a limited amount of space. The combat is not satisfying and becomes incredibly tedious once a rhythm is formed. The same kind experience can be given from a free half-life mod called cry of fear and in my opinion is a creepier game than this one. For a more weapon and combat orientated experience I would recommend the painkiller games.			"

												TL;DR: This game feels like it really, really wants to be The Suffering (particularly in terms of story and setting), which is what I recommend you go play instead.Graphics-wise, for a Nintendo DS port, it's not bad when bumped up to Fantastic quality. I didn't have any problems running it on my system in terms of FPS, so it's not like it's a bad port, but I wouldn't call it ""HD"" either. Sound quality's a more mixed bag; some sounds were okay (I think because they were fixed in a patch), whereas others are tinny and very low fidelity. Where Dementium II really falls down is the gameplay. Enemies are bullet sponges, and there's no discernable difference between most weapons. It takes the same number of shells, bullets, flamethrower uses, etc. to kill most common enemies. Except for sometimes, when one inexplicably dies in one shot (maybe I got a headshot? It's hard to tell where hitboxes are with the enemies' herky-jerky movements), and other times, when one inexplicably takes 6+ bullets to kill. I don't even know.They do try to mix it up a few times, mostly with the bosses (the fight against ""The Giant"" was actually kind of fun). And sometimes with unkillable enemies, or enemies that KO and then revive, because everyone loves wasting ammunition! ...Seriously, the combat is borderline atrociously bad.On the plus side, it was only ~5 hours long, and I got it on sale for <$4 USD. ...Still though. Just go play The Suffering. Trust me.			"

												A lot of horror games seem to forget that at the end of the day, their game is supposed to be fun. You can cram it full of weird monsters and spooky notes and jumpscares all you want, but if it's not fun to play, no one's going to care. Dementium feels like it really takes that to heart, balling up a bunch of common elements and a few cliches in a package entertaining enough that you won't care about the details.You play William Redmoor, apparently the same guy as in the original Dementium, whose brain problems have landed him in an oddly secure mental hospital. You have a habit of hallucinating some very Painkiller-looking monsters, and indeed your perception shifts between the hospital and its baton-wielding security guards and some gritty, monster-filled hell dimension. It's a pretty good hook, if not a terribly original one, but the game throws in a bunch of neat details to spice it up. You have a full map of each area, and there are all sorts of side rooms and locked doors that you need additional weapons or items to access. It feels almost Metroidy, except for that the core path is quite linear and there are no real secrets, just places to remember to backtrack to.There's a pretty good spread of monsters as well, though they tend to lean towards melee types and aren't particularly fast or threatening. They have a ton of health, which can make fights tedious, but to be fair, so do you, hence the lack of threat. Outside of their Clive Barkery appearance they're not particularly scary. Dementium also likes setting up enemy arenas and gauntlets to work through, and with the generous amounts of health the enemies have these can really bust up the game flow, and not in a good way. New weapons and foes come quickly enough to keep you interested and moving forward, though.What really got me about Dementium was how fleshed out it is as a game, despite the core gameplay and combat being a little cheap and weak. There's a perfectly good tutorial baked into the opening of the game that gets you right into the action. You have an inventory screen where you can fiddle with items and check your selection of health and buff supplies. You get to leave the hospital behind after the first chapter and explore some outdoor areas. The cutscenes are clean and frequent, even if the animation quality is lacking. And even the story tries to be a little different, with a mysterious antagonistic doctor talking about his plot to create the very real monsters from your own brain.For a title originally released on the DS, Dementium II HD is a solid, well-rounded FPS adventure that really doesn't suffer for its console origins. Each of its many parts is polished and arranged with the others to form a legitimately entertaining package. As long as the combat doesn't wear you out, you'll find plenty of fun in this one, something that can be hard to find in other horror games.			"

												If Doom 3 and Silent Hill had a baby... but then it turned out that they were closely related... this is what their offspring would resemble... a bit of a mess which tried too hard to incorporate elements of each game. In all honesty the game isn't a bad concept, but it is VERY poorly executed! The control system and game play leave a lot to be desired, graphics are tolerable but by no means good and the voice acting is appallingly flat. There is very little story depth to the game and I've always felt that the story is one of, if not the most important element of a good horror / survival horror game. As other reviews have stated, the horror genre is a pretty heavily saturated market at the moment, and there are titles available for the same kind of money which are a million times better than this. The game is very easy to 100% so there is that as a positive at least, but please don't take the fact that I have taken the time to get all of the achievements as an indication of the games quality or of my enjoyment of the game... 3.5/10 "

												Dementium II HD is not a perfect game, and I'd rather be able to give it horizontal thumbs, but since it's either up or down, all in all, it's thumbs up.Cons:- game crashes randomly, mostly when you encounter acid spitting irritators. - not convincing plot, if there is any.- awkward movements and fight mechanics- with above there is a moment when precise jumping matters, which can be pretty frustrating at first, since there's no near save point.- save points. On two or three occasions I wish they were more and placed more smartly.Pros:- it's a survival horror game after all.- climate.- nice music and ambient sounds.- some kick♥♥♥♥♥locations like hospital ward or abandoned village during winter time.- game has its captivating moments and at times really feels like survival horror (gotta hold on to that ammo, for you don't know what awaits next).- The weapons (for me party started when got that bone saw).- transitions between horrid reality and even more horrid  alternative reality, most likely shaped by William's twisted mind. - The scene at the very ending. All in all, although crashes irritated and it took some time to get used to movement, it is pretty neat horror game.  "

												I've not yet completed this game, But im really enjoying it. I love the monsters the atmosphere and It also has the ability to spook you. One thing i did pick up on which i truely hate is the fact ALL the guns shoot marshmallows! its so random. I can shoot the chestmaws twice in the head and kill them, Or i can waste a whole clip in their head and they're still standing. Ugh, i wish it had more of a stronger feel on the weapons.. But i've been making it through anyways. Its really no big deal for anyone not named Amanda, but to have your name in a game was a happy surprise. It is a bit buggy for the achievements, i beat the second boss in the game Twice mind you And it didnt unlock the witch or 'killing any boss with a sledgehammer' achievements. I was reading up on it and hopefully those will unlock when the next boss is beaten. I give this game a 9/10. Even though its buggy/dodgey shots. i really like the 'story' so far.			"

I got it on sale when it was like $2.50 or something but I would gladly pay $15-$20 for it. the game is rich in environment and details, don't get me started on the lighting... haha the lighting is one of my favorites in the game. and the music! man, I love the music, wish it came with a soundtrack or you could buy one, I definitely would buy it, it's simple but haunting and great. okay, let me wrap things up, if you want a good game with a vague but strong story look no further and buy this game.P.S: gonna do another play through only usin' the shiv. hahah			"

The gameplay is boring, and unexciting; and for anyone that has played a FPS or anything with a horror theme will be bored.Its playable, but personally lost interest after a couple of hours.I dont regret the purchase as the game is not broken, it is just not of PC quality.

												I read the reviews for this game and did notice that the general opinion wasn't really high praise. But sometimes, I like to take a gamble and buy a game like that anyway when it's heavily discounted. For the first 30 minutes or so, I thought I might be one of the minority of people who actually like this game. I liked the setting and the monsers, who kind of made me think of Clive Barker's early work.But then I encountered the first 'black ghost' monsters. When you get near these ghosts, they send you to sort of an arena where you have to fight 4 simple monsters, after which you're returned to a point in the game before encountering the ghost. So you're supposed to find your way around them. But while analyzing the corridors and the position of the many ghosts, you'll be sent to the arena to kill the same 4 monsters dozens of times. At that point, it got too tedious for me to continue. I have about 600 games on Steam and GoG combined, so I really don't want to spend hours killing the same few monsters without really progressing one bit in a game. Combined with the other complaints you'll read in the reviews here, like a very tedious combat system (melee is just mindless clicking, ranged has the accuracy of a blind man's aim), very repetitive gameplay, the fact that the game doesn't save your settings, broken Steam Achievements and graphics that aren't worthy of the 'HD' in the game's title, I suggest you skip this one. Plenty of better games on Steam.			"

												I've been playing Renegade Kid games for a while, starting with the first Dementium when it first came out on the DS almost 10 years ago. I also finished Moon on DS. And I remember getting this game and playing for about 30 minutes before my DS got stolen one day. I didn't even get a taste of what this game was like.You see, Dementium: The Ward was pretty amazing, because it's one of the few first person survival horror games I can think of on the DS. Sure, it was buggy, sure, the animations were wonky, sure, one of the worst parts, enemies respawned all the time, and suuure, the game was ♥♥♥♥ing short. I managed to finish it on a single sitting.Now, I got this years ago. I got to play Dementium II back when it first game out, and when I found out that they were making a PC port, I was excited. I'll be able to finally seal this chapter of my life. Well, I guess the game didn't age well at all. Unlike Obscure.  The port seems lazy, the visuals look like something out of the PS2 era, the sounds are atrocious most of the time, and the controls feel kinda...Laggy. I swear, it feels like some of your attacks, or even when you stop moving ,there's this momentum before anything happens. Less than a second, but still quite noticeable. The game is rather short. I managed to finish it in less than 4 hours. The achievements can't be all unlocked in a single sitting, though. Because you need to re-do some of the boss fights with a different weapon to get some of them. The world is heavily inspired by Silent Hill, and the monsters seem to be, too, yet they don't even come close to being scary most of the time. Same for the ambience. This game feels lackluster, unpolished, the animations are terrible at times, and all in all, it's not really scary. I think what made the original Dementium amazing was the fact that there was not much like it on the DS at the time, and when translated to the PC (albeit, lazily), where there's MUCH better games out there, this game feels vastly inferior and mediocre. The ending is completely underwhelming, too and the final boss was a pushover. The storytelling was...Not that good. I mean, I enjoyed it. I've got a thing for mediocre games, and I like the dementium games as dumb as they are, but for the average Joe, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Sigh. It's really such a shame to say that I wouldn't recommend this game. I remember seeing this game for the Nintendo DS, but I never got a chance to pick it up. And then this game come to PC with the ""HD"" version on the title. Saw the negative reviews on the front page but it really can't be that bad right? Since it's horror and everything I figured I might as well try it myself.The term ""disappointment"" is a horrible understatement. I didn't expect much graphic wise since it is a port but despite the HD upgrade on the PC, the graphics are still behind the times and everything about it feels outdated. The gameplay is probably better for the Nintendo DS but abysmal for the PC and it's not just the gameplay, it's everything. The sounds repeat for each monster type, the combat music is the exact same loop and the ambiance music is the same. As for the story, well there is a little to no story in the game. You can pick up notes and things but even they do not offer any kind of story, just hints on your current situation. Trust me, there's more story on the description page than the actual game itself. The monsters are the same warped grotesque things we have seen in the entire Silent Hill franchise and the terror effect no longer exists. Enemies act and look the same to their type. Again there is no explanation for these monsters and why they exist. Most of the game takes place in prison walls, and while there is the occasional town to break up the scenery, most of the game looks pretty flat and dull before long. Colors tend to stick to realistic browns and grays, and while the monsters show some different colors, even they often stick to darker versions of bright colors. Everything looks drab as a result, and the lack of variety in the locations only makes looking at the game that much less interesting.The walking speed is the speed you should be when crouched or laying down in other games and the run speed is the walking speed. You must hold down the run button the entire time you play but it's okay since you have infinite stamina. You can pick up health pills, medkits, adrenaline shots and poison resistant bottles but I never once used the shots, bottles or medkits and only a couple times used health pills. You can also get a flashlight that flickers on and off constantly, but when it's on a weapon, it stays on.And then there's the bug. Oh yeah, the gamebreaking bug. You see, I've been playing for three hours and it's all fine and dandy. After encountered the second reanimator monster, I got teleported into the other world and fight against five of those face-spitting acid monsters. Done my business there and finally back to normal world and guess what? I can't get outside of that toilet room! I've tried running, crouching, jumping, slashing, shooting at the open door but the game still won't let me out. There's a machine gun ammo there but it sure as hell didn't help. So here I was thinking, eh maybe I can reload a few saves back and the bug will be gone! But nope, the game decided to say ""Well son, that's what you get for not listening to the negative reviews on the store page! Now you get to experience it yourself."" And as you can guess, the bug is still there. At this point I already gave up trying and decided to write this review.It simply baffles me how they can slap High Definition on this when all that was done was barely touching the graphics and adding cutscenes. Within three minutes you can predict when monsters will apear and how the game is going to go pace wise and gameplay wise. And it seems after all these years, the developer didn't even bother to fix their game. The lesson here? Listen to the other reviews before buying anything and it will save you so much time and money. There are dozens of other, better shooters and horror games for your money — ones that make better use of PC controls, sound, and graphical power, so you’re better off steering clear of this game.

												Honestly, just play the DS game.  If you haven't yet, Dementium 2 is a fun little survival horror FPS with neat-looking monsters, limited ammo, and themes revolving around losing your sanity and blurring the line between real and fake. It's not the most revolutionary thing, but it's got some heart.All of what I just said there applies to the DS version. The HD version did NOTHING to improve the gameplay, and it really shows. The enemies are easy to dodge now that you have WASD movement instead of DPAD+Touch screen, enemies require way too many hits to kill considering how little ammo you get, the level design is too spacious and devoid of much to do, and the sound is reused from the DS version in all its low bitrate.These could be all surmountable problems if the combat had felt smooth and polished, but it's not. It's the same ""strafe back and forth out of enemy's attack range with melee weapons"" combat you've probably seen in other games, and shooting feels stiff and lacking any punch. I attribute the latter's problems to the Unity engine (which this game runs on), mainly because I'm of the belief that it takes serious work to make something look/feel good in that engine. As an aside, if you do want to see a good example of a well-polished Unity engine game, take a look at Endless Legend.Sadly, the game being ""HD"" tampers with its general horror theme. Better controls means you aren't struggling against them during fights, better view distance makes areas that were once thick with darkness reveal just how empty they really are, and the lighting feels static and blandly applied. Even the animations for the weapons feel too floaty and lacking the correct feeling of power that they should have.Ultimately, Dementium II HD just feels like a straight ""pretty-ing up"" of the game, and misses the opportunity to refine and tweak gameplay to fit for a game free of the DS's tight resource restrictions. In many ways, the performance limits helped Dementium II feel tense and scary, but the PC version fails in that regard. Dementium II is a good game, but only on the DS.			"

												This was probably an amazing DS game. As a PC game, however, it would have been pretty mediocre 4-5 years ago. Weak story, weak repetitive gameplay, graphics that look ugly as sin, incredibly stupid enemies and cutscenes that seem both random and terrible. The only good thing that I can say is that it is technically proficient with no real glitches or anything. I guess if you're in the mood for a good old fashioned bad game to make fun of while you play, then this might be right up your alley. If not, avoid it altogether.			"

												I played this game for about two hours...thats more then enough time anyone should really spend on this.Dementium II HD is quite literally Dementium II... HD...  no new animations, gameplay, stories, etc.... it is literally the DS version...with HD graphics.  Man oh man does this game not translate well to PC.  You'll be dealing with the dumbest AI, clunky movement, horrible animations, boring atmospheres, blocky models, and cheap narritave.  It has some value to it in the fact that the puzzles and the concepts are fun to solve and observe... but other than that you should probably just play this what it was meant on... a 3.25 inch screen with a stylus...

												I understand most of the neg reviews here but i feel like this game is good for what it is and to me it felt like a lost Silent Hill episode. I grew up on the original RE and SH games (im 36 btw) so there's that. +Good creepy music+Some nice enemy design+Genuinely creepy atmosphere and environments. +Good map design. +Nice selection of weapons/items. +Notes, postcards and other things scattered to read which to me, added to the eeriness. +Doesn't take *too* long to finish. +Achievements, cloud saves, cards. -Graphic tearing constantly, (can enable v-sync though). -Controls are a bit clunky, (but doable)- feels like when running it should be a lot faster. Walking while crouched is also wonky. -Game is split into 5 chapters, i felt like 4 should've been enough. -Lots of little ""bugs/annoyances"" (which i plan to make a thread to help others) that drag the game down, ( i think the biggest issue here).

												Don't listen to what most of these people say. This is a fantastic game as it not only is a horror game, but also a puzzle game. I have seen the version for this game on the nintendo DS and I thought it was incredible for it's time, but the controlls were a bigger question mark. Later, I bought this game on steam, and the advanced graphics blew my mind. I expected to see DS graphics, but instead I got a bit of a more PC feeling. Even if it seems a bit choppy with the gunplay, it's not bad. I find this a fun game to play on saturday nights and I reccomend this as a good game for everyone including beginners to horror games.

												i finally beat this game so i can give it a fair review... It's an awful game. When i first came into this game, i went in an open mind. I knew nothing about the game, i just wanted to try it out. The gameplay was extremely slow and painful, some of the creatures were annoying and back tracking was a pain. The story was just a ""WTF"" type of story to me. The overall enviroment was like ""Silent Hill' but crappier to all craps. I really did not enjoy this game, if you plan on buying it, BE WARNED.			"

												I tried to like this game. I really wanted to... and I'd be willing to give a sequel a look as well.  However they're going to have to up the graphics and work on the controls, story, gunplay, enemy-play, everything.  I realize its a port from a hand held game, but with whats on steam right now there are quite a few better alternatives for horror shooters on the PC.  Most of the cool looking monsters and graphic videos on the store page are just from a few in game movies. If you have a few hours to waste and you dont mind the above then give it a shot. I did think that the ""overseer"" that was watching you was kinda creepy and that was a nice touch.  ...it was also kinda cool taking out most of the enemies (including bosses) with a prison shank.

Product received for free
												Originally a Nintendo DS game this is the sequal to the horror video game Dementuim: The Ward. This game has been upgraded from DS quality graphics to decent PC graphics. Unfortunately there are not a lot of scary elements in this game except for that big black shadow that chases you in a boiler room. Most of the gameplay is very wonky but what do you expect since this was a port from the DS game. The story maybe confusing if you never played the first game on DS but if you know the story of the first game and never played the sequel don't have very high expectations for this game's story because Its slightly under whelming. If you still have the DS and want to play this game its a little better than this game. Overall this game is okay.			"

												Cliver Barker's Silent Hill... almost.Unfortunately, not Undying and Silent Hill 2, but Jericho and one of the more recent, crappy Silent Hill games.A port of a Nintendo DS game, I can't imagine how much of a pain it'd be to play on that system.  Much of it feels rather stiff (obviously dictated by its original platform), especially in the movement - and I say this as some who thinks the movement in System Shock 2 is completely appropriate for the respective game.Further perplexing is how much focus there is on combat, given the system it was first developed for.  While there are times where just running away is an option, they often put you in situations where you must destroy all the enemies in an area to proceed.  This feels like it works against the general vibe of the game, which seems to be shooting for (and accomplishing to some extent) a true survival horror quality.  I feel they should've focused on more of the Resident Evil-like puzzles the game had, and leaving combat as a secondary option.The classic Silent Hill inspirations are very prominant, right down to the nightmare world changes.  Mix in some Hellraiser, and you've got the general visual design.  This and the audio design are where the game shines the most.  Still hampered by being an up-rezzed port of a DS game, but you can definitely feel the artistic ability the team has in these areas.In all, it reminds me of Blue Stinger - a game that's not horrible, but having a few poorly thought out aspects that hold it back from being a great game.  If you need something to at least scratch that survival horror itch in these days of action horror games, this will do alright, giving you about three to four hours of relief.(Those jumping puzzles near the end though, Jesus Christ.  Just horrible game design, especially for a game with terrible jumping.)			"

If you REALLY WANT to, just get a NDS if you don't already have one and get the original game, which is an amazing game. This HD port ruins everything about it. And the developers have seemingly stopped caring. Do not buy this game. I wish I could get a refund, but I bought this long before Steam added their refund features.			"

												Yet another straight dump port from consoles, dumped into Steam, this time from the Nintendo DS. Even from the very first time you launch the game it gets obvious how little work was put into this, after a low definitiin intro movie you are left alone in a world of low count polys, low res textures, and even low input options.If you don't have an original x360 controller, forget about this, there is a good chance you will be forced to play an straight console port, with keyboard and mouse. In a most sacarstic way, perhaps as a testimony of the effort they put into making this, they didn't care to rename the executable of the game, which is called, DII_Beta.exe.Yup, you heard that right, such is the quality of the games we are seeing being dumped into Steam.At least I was able to get some amount of money back with the trading cards. 100% dump material, NOT recommended.

												I remember playing the First game on the DS and thought ""HEY this is great."", but that was years ago and seeing this pop up on Steam I thought ""HEY DEMENTIUM! I LIKED THAT GAME!"" plus it was cheap and thought hey why not and bought it. I started playing it and found out the hard way about the true nature of this game. First off the game feels old. Like Windows XP old. It's terrible. The Animations are stiff and gosh the cutscenes are just awful. Now Graphics aren't end all or be all for the game, but the Gameplay itself is STUPIDLY subpar. Just wack enemies with a Knife or Shoot them with your Gun, it doesn't matter everyone is a sponge to your hits anyway even if you hit them on the head. Overall if you have this game on the DS there doesn't seem to be a reason to upgrade to the PC version unless you REALLY want to play it with a Mouse and Keyboard. Those that haven't played this game? I'd probably stay away from this since there's WAY better Survival Horror games out there.			"

It's ugly, that's it. Monsters are ugly, when you attack an ennemy, it's ugly.Explain me why the name of this game is ""Dementium II HD"" whereas it reach the top of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gtaphics ? (I precise when graphics are on their max). I'm open of all answers, but it's gonna be hard.Second, a lot of little thing like time for switching weapon.

												In 2010 Renegate Kids released Dementium 2 on the DS.Flowing the formula of the first game it created a rich horror experience for its sequel on the DSIn 2013 we get Dementium 2 hd.(Developed by Memetic Games)A crapmake (remake or port) of a decent ds game that does not hold up to the original ds title and its sequel.I will explain, the DS version pushed the handheld to is limits . You cannot have a 60 frame per second first person shooter game on the DS. Characters will move slowly you cannot go fast. So it could not run fluently which is fine because it was a ds game.The crapmake (remake or port) has optimisation problems and does not showcase any outstanding graphics (they actually look pretty outdated), the game was unplayable with Mouse and Keyboard at launch (ITS A PC GAME ????) and there are some achievement glitches which is a pain.It seems like the sound effects were rip out from the DS game which is disappointing.There only thing positive of this Edition is that the lighting effect and resolution are a lot better that on the DS.Now when a game is categorise as remake its mean re-imagining of the original idea (look at the remake of resident evil as a example of a better game).This fails miserably in doing that.What this crapmake does is that it stains what was so enjoyable about the DS version.The DS game was scary, the hd remake is not.My original review of the DS had a rating of 7.5/10 which was a flawed but was still a good game, the HD gets a 3/10  its a terrible remake or port(which kills me because i praised the DS version so much in 2010).There are other great horror game to be played on PC.Dont buy the HD version, purchase the DS instead and play it on your 3DS.Dont waste your money.3/10 Verdict: Do Not Play this GamePros - Better lighting effects and resolution.Cons- Character moves slowly like on the ds.- Nothing has been reinvented to make the experience fresh on PC. - Rip off way to many sound effect For the DS Version that do not sound good on PC. - And last but not least a same-full port.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Dementium II HD 

			Views: 145		

			Dementium 2 HD is a so called FPS horror game on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/217100/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Dementium II is a horror escape FPS.The game crashes, is full of bugs, tearing and clipping,graphically is a big competitor for games just released in1998....only problem is that it's just a bit past 1998!At some point, these and many other game developers got it into their head that lots of blood and gore equals horror.  Forget suspense, forget being drawn into the atmosphere,or the adrenaline rush that surges in a player when there is a genuine fear of what's around the corner, or that they might die.The game is extremely linear, and poorly designed, so that you have the pleasure of trying door after door that is locked and or ultimately leads nowhere.The game employs delaying tactics such as infrequent savepoints and and excessive amount of loading screens.  The story is poorly written and full of inconsistencies, the weapons are weak and have no decent recoil or sense of power, andthe combat is a joke.Even if this game were on sale for a nickel, I would adviseyou to save yourself the headache.For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basicsummary of what I cover in my video.Thanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Do not believe what the other reviewers said! Dementium 2 is actually a true MASTERPIECE! It is the NEW innovative game to the FPS genre next to Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake, Quake 2, Rainbow Six, Half-Life, SWAT3, Deus Ex, Unreal Tournament, Quake 3, etc.Graphics include dynamic shadow and HIGH polygons count models! Blocky and muddy models  offer a SCARY monster design that would put Doom 3, Silent Hill and Amnesia to shame!Also the melee combat system is extremely SATISFYING! Think about Skyrim, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic and Zeno Clash put together. Combats require thinking and a good use of momentum and environment. A survival horror heavy on TACTICAL elements.The shooting is also very solid. The Battlefield and Counter-Strike community will find the game very CHALLENGING in their first playthrough.Despite the high quality of the gameplay the real HIGHLIGHT of the game is the plot. It is so UNPREDICTABLE! Think about Godfather mixed with Usual Suspects and Shawshank Redemption and you will get an idea how EXCELLENT this game is!Hey wait! What I am saying? What is this non-sense? I didn't write that! Oh no! Help! I fell into the WARD... insanity... madness... DEMENTIUM!Rating:4.0			"

												Dementium II HD is a port of a Nintendo DS survival horror fps. I have the first one on the NDS and it makes good us of the NDS limits. Dementium II HD is straight port with ""upgraded"" graphics. So don't expect PC survival horror gameplay. The new graphics are cleaner and ruin the scary atmosphere the NDS version had. The biggest problem this version has is that there are a lot of bugs. For example options setting that don't load. But also game breaking bugs like the game crashing at a certain point. If you really want to play this game try to somehow get the NDS version.			"

												This is an okay game. I think a lot of people didn't know what to expect when this game came out. (It's basically a PC port of a Nintendo DS game.) It stays true to the original Dementium 2. The AI isn't anything special and the graphics aren't anything spectacular, but it does have some cool monsters. Most of them won't put up much of a fight though. The hit detection is a pain, but if you manuever just right it shouldn't be a problem. If you're expecting this game to be like Resident Evil, then you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for kicks, and in the mood for a really campy horror movie, then you might like this game.Update: I can no longer recommend this game due to a game breaking glitch. I was playing in chapter 4 when my melee weapons stopped working. Melee weapons include the knife, sledgehammer, and dynomite. Now that I've reached the colossus, and the dynomite isn't working, (The dynomite is needed to kill colossus.) I can't progress further.			"

												Nah. When i first reviewed this game I thought it was rather good. See, the thing is, somehow, the HD PC PORT OF A DS GAME is worse than the DS version in every way. The controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥ and somehow the guns are harder to aim than the DS version, which used a ♥♥♥♥ing touch pad to control it. The weapons, while being better graphically, are worse designed. For example, in the DS version, the sledgehammer actually looks like a hammer. But the PC version just looks like a stick with a brick attached to the end. It's small annoyances like this that kill the game for me. Another oddity is that when firing the revolver, there is a short delay between the muzzle flash and the kickback of the shot, which makes the revolver feel like one of the worst feeling weapons to use the entire games industry. There are more things, but it's mostly just small♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. How did they ♥♥♥♥ this up? I'm a big fan of the Dementium games, I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them back in the DS days.

												I bought and played the original Dementium games years ago when they came out on the Nintendo DS. I loved these games because unlike many indie survival horror games that use cheap jump-scares, these games heavily utilized the environment to unsettle the player, similar to Silent HIll (the player is even taken to another world while he searches for his wife). So I was excited when I heard they were going to make and HD port, unfortunately, this port was not made by the original dev team, and it shows.This port has ""cleaned up"" all the visuals, the environments are not as dirty and rusty as they were. At points it even has a cartoony look to it, taking away any unsettling feeling the original gave off. The indoor areas are suppose to be the scariest part due to them being dark and the player would rely on the flashlight, yet here they're bright enough to not even need the flashlight, worse still, most of them give off sunlight through the windows or cracks. The weapons feel weaker, they don't have the same kick. During some cutscenes, only one side of the speakers gave off any audio. If you wanna know how much the visuals were ""cleaned up"", simply look at the box arts between the original and this HD port.The original is a great indie survival horror game, this port undoes most of the visuals the original did so beautifully. I recommend buying the original on the Nintendo DS or getting an emulator.			"

												After playing this HD version I'd say... don't play it! As far as it goes it is much, much worse than the original DS version which was an excellent game for the system. This HD port has poor graphics, running at half of the framerate of the original, with weird and clunky enemy animations, awful hit detection and an annoying control scheme that makes the game fairly boring, especially some minor enemies that seem almost impossible to kill without getting hit a lot first. That goes for both melee and firearms. The sound department is ok, nothing spectacular but it manages to do its job. As for the story, well it is confusing and after a while, I really didn't care at all. The achievements are somewhat easy and manageable to get on the first round if you don't mess it up. Bottom line, get a DS and play that version if you're curious about this title.			"

Even the story is decent ... but its potential seems to be lost on the PC version. Somewhat unfitting music and at the point you're able to predict effects and horror events due to a short black screen before a cut screne etc. Dementium II looses its horror.

												Dementium on DS? Alright.Dementium II on DS? Great. My favourite game on the DS.Dementium II on PC? Terrible.This game was made out to be a complete remake of the game for PC. What we got was a lazy port of the DS Version, which runs worse than it does on the DS, with much clunkier controls and hit detection.It has slightly better graphics, granted. But the better textures actually take away from the immersion and horror, removing the Silent Hill-esque feeling of the game. Oh and they added a ""new"" monster (reskinned version of another monster) where there should be no monster. Especially an invincible one.I spent 99 cents on this and still feel quite ripped off.Buy the DS version on Ebay for the same price or emulate it for free. But just don't buy this game.			"

												This is probably one of the scariest games I've ever played, but not for the reason you'd expect.  The game was so prone to freeze up or crash just for doing basic actions like picking up an item or opening a door that I never knew what to expect.  On many occasions it would crash right after a difficult boss battle or a long stretch without saving.  Then it's back to the last save point hoping and praying that it didn't happen again.It also suffers from terrible lag and some of the worst screen tearing I've ever seen.  This makes combat and navigating traps  more difficult than it needs to be.There are also some questionable changes from the original such as enemies now taking more hits to defeat and the removal of the squealing that the worms make.If you want to play this game, track down the original for the DS.  This version isn't worth the time or effort.			"

Yes, the graphics and various aspects of the game are very dated, but it's still an entertaining game that'll keep you occupied trying finishing the story and accomplishing the achievements. If it would have came out in early 2000 around the time of Postal II came out, it would have been a huge horror hit. Regardless, it's still entertaining and good bang for it's buck, especially when on sale 75% off. I recommend you grab it then.			"

However, I did not have the code and thus had to backtrack to the church. After backtracking and retrieving the postcard with the code, I journeyed back to the lock and on my return, I was not able to use the dagger and examine the lock. All that remained was a description of the lock when I looked at the door.This game is ok for a DS game, but I wouldn't say it sets the world on fire, not enough for me to restart the game again. I think I would have been left with a better impression if I didn't have the game breaking bug.			"

 For PC gamers, Dementium II HD is a very shoddy first person horror game which unfortunately will be on par with much of the ""Jim Sterling bait"" awful horror PC games. This game has more quality than many of these games, but there's only a very small niche of people I can recommend this to, which you are probably not part of - just avoid it.Also note, my review became more of me telling a story in order to review the game, since I only spent little time with it. It took me longer to write this than for me wanting to play it. Let me preface this review with the fact that I am somebody who completed the original Dementium: The Ward on the Nintendo DS. It wasn't an amazing game, but for a first person horror shooter on the DS in 2007, it did it's job well enough. I enjoyed it and it currently has a rating of 72 on Metacritic - so a decent amount of other players enjoyed it. Many Steam reviewers also made VERY clear that this was a port of the original DS game, so I was well aware of that when I purchased this, since I wanted to continue the series and was willing to forgo some amount of quality.*sigh* BOI. That was a big mistake. I first went into options, where Action was Right Mouse instead of E, Zoom was Z instead of Right Mouse, and Crouch was C instead of Left Ctrl. Easy to fix though, due to rebindable keys, and honestly this control scheme works for really old games. The only reason why I bring this up is because when I started a new game, I needed to interact with an object and no key worked. I can only assume it is a gltich from rebinding the keys, or maybe the fact that I had a gamepad connected, but no button would interact their either.A restart fix the issue, which also caused the game to open in windowed mode. Maybe because I changed the resolution before I closed it? Still, selecting ""Windowed Mode Off"" in the options didn't make it full screen and I had to Alt + Enter. Fine, another super minor thing, but it's a bad presentation. I start the game. A starting NPC has a weird seam on his shoulder (signs of a low poly/quality charater model). NPCs keep repeating the same 2 lines of dialog every few seconds. I make progress to combat which is simply wacking a shank in front of you as the enemy creature flashes red until it dies after over 9000 hits. Playing as a prisoner, I reach a point where two security guards try to taze/kill me, but all I have is a pithy knife versus their armor and electric batons. I run past them to a another room which requires a load screen. Since this is a new loading area and all I did was go through an unlocked door, these PRISON SECURITY GUARDS NO LONGER EXIST. I understand this is an old school gaming mechanic - but you can't expect me to take a mental institute/prison escape seriously with something like that - at least have them pretend to knock on the door saying ""OPEN UP!""I eventually make it to a boss battle, where I'm pitted against an 8 ft tall, 6 ft wide creature that looks like a Half-Life Headcrab, that can crawl on walls and ceilings and probably could impale me on his spiked arms. So am I supposed to run away from this huge creature? Maybe some scripted event will stop it or slow it down for me to run. No, I'm put in a circular arena to fight it, with my prison shank. The entire fight consists of a simple man fighting a giant, demonic/alien looking headcrab with a rusty shank, slapping it about him a few dozen times until he dies. There is some AI to him - he crawls around on the ceiling, does leap attacks, spits acid/blood, summon worm like creatures to assist. but it is a simple battle of attrition with poor combat (in which I had to heal to win) until he died. I won, and the game then rewarded me with a pistol AFTER the fact.I take said pistol with me, and get stuck in a monster closet with two ""standard zombie"" creatures. The limited ammo on my person and in the level was enough to kill them all, and I had to resort to my shank again, with more poor, slap happy combat. I turned the game off.DO NOT BUY! I only recommend this to: Players of the First Dementium, huge fan of horror games, and people with a high tolerance of mediocre/sub-par games. The ""demented"" angle makes for an interesting story, but this game is pretty bad.			"

There's nothing scary about this game and honestly, if you're looking for a game to freak you out or even just plays well and has good controls, stick with Outlast or the Amnesia series.

												This was a very disappointing game. I expected the graphics to be dated, I mean it's  a DS port, so know that this thumbs down has nothing to do with the graphics... It's the game play.  It feels like I'm playing a tablet game with a mouse and keyboard.  The old, move forward slash, back up, to dodge, move forward slash, back up, rinse and repeat until the enemy falls down is literally how 90% of the combat plays out.  The remaining 10% is using firearms that are not nearly as effective as the melee attacks and run out of ammo quickly.  It's one of those games that just re-spawns enemies over and over again to fill time.  Oh the door is magically closed until you kill the same two enemies 5 times that spawn on opposite ends of the room and move very slowly.  The floating black clouds with 6 glowing eyes are the worst part of this game.  They teleport you to an arena where you fight... You guessed it 2 guys on opposite ends of the room that re-spawn 2 times apiece and then re-spawn on the opposite two walls 2 times.  And you don't just go through this once, OH NO, that would be too easy.  They force you to go through this every time you touch the black cloud and the black cloud doesn't go away after the arena, oh no he re-spawns and there are at times 3 of these guys in a room and each one will send you to the same arena, again and again and again.  The levels are very small, so in some ways you should feel comfortable like you couldn't get lost, but there is a lot of back tracking and little areas where you have to do something in area A before you can open a door in area C, but there is no reason area C would be unlocked no other than ""magic"".  I hate that kind of thing..  At least they had a good reason with the whole sledge hammer weapon (you can knock down wooden barricades) but the entire nature of these game feels like it's trying to stretch out it's game play as long as possible and it gets down right boring.  It's not scary, it's not exciting and it feels slow to the point where it's not fun.  That is my opinion of this game.  I sadly pre-ordered it...  *sigh*			"

												Even patched, it's still a broken game. I thought it'd be a good deal for $1.99 considering how much potential this game has. The graphics aren't worthy to be considered HD, as some models look like they're of the early PS2 era, yet some details are high quality, it doesn't look too good for a Unity engine game. The gameplay is unchanged from its DS counterpart, albeit that it's mediocre due to the lack of alterations, enemies are stupid and don't serve as a threat, firearms lack hit detection even when you blast them at point-blank range, and I can't get far enough into the game as it just crashes as soon as I defeat an enemy or enter a different area (I bought this game yesterday and I tried playing it today, crashes just started occuring.) Sound is decent, some are ripped straight from Counter-Strike, Dementium II itself and some of its own sounds, yet the Dementium II sounds are still compressed, that's not good. The story is the same as the original DII so I won't spoil it. Do not buy this game, get the DS version or if you want this so badly, just get it, be aware of the possible game-breaking bugs that might occur.			"

												I do not reccomend this game for the following reasons:1. You need to hold down a chosen key to run, who wants to walk slowly through a game? ALL games should allow the player to set it up so the character will travel as fast as possible.2. There is no quick save, you have to save at these mirrors located throughout the game.3. There is no way to block, who just stands there and takes a hit from an enemy?4. The movements all weird, it reminds me of an older game like resident evil. The movement should be fluid.5. The character makes a noise when he jumps and another when he lands, I dont mind some noise but nobody makes that much of a grunting noise while jumping, it sounds like porn.6. Not sure if its my system yet but it crashes everytime at the same place as soon as I pick up the keycard. (even with the very minimal video settings).			"

												I saw Dementium II (notice the ""HD"") and noted both its price and the fact it was originally a Nintendo DS game, and I understood quite well it wouldn't be a magnificient work of art, but still thought I'd be able to enjoy it-Sweet baby Jesus was I wrong. Graphics/textures are terrible, audio and cutscenes are terrible, gameplay/controls are terrible. Everything was indeed frightening, but not in the way I hoped it'd be. Save yourself 5-10$ and fifteen minutes of confusion and spend your cash on something not as demented as Dementium II.			"

												Dementium: The Ward provided a great survival-horror experience for the Nintendo DS, disempowering the player and forcing them to figure out how to move in the claustrophobic setting while trying to conserve ammo until absolutely necessary. Renegade Kid followed it up with a fantasic sequel that may not have been purely survival-horror, but found a great mix between action and horror elements with ambient spaces, creepy enemies, and a story which didn't come out and answer everything, letting the player be immeresed in the both the confusion and dreadful mystery of it all. It was by no means a spectacular game, but I was a fan of it despite the flaws. The HD port takes everything I loved about the DS version and throws it out the window. Where the gritty graphics complemented the DS's capabilities, the graphics for this game can hardly be considered HD. They look plasticy and the models can hardly look creepy when they look so clean and polished. The ambient music is gone to, some new tracks do add feeling to empty areas, but some area's music was swapped out for something that doesn't fit the mood. The combat has been scaled way back to the point of a boring chore. Where the DS weapons felt like they had weight and stopping power on the endless horde, the weapons in the PC version feel like you're shooting NERF darts at the enemies, and that's if you can hit them at all because the camera is so dang choppy when more than one enemiy come on screen. It's not my computer, I have a great computer. But looking around feels like the character has a mental problem. Also, there is a half second delay between clicking and using a weapon, which makes timing shots or swings at a fast enemy nearly impossible. The game also introduces a new enemy, an invincible snow ghost which rushes you out of an area, but they put them in the more atmospheric of areas and take away from exploration into just what is going on in the story. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET THE DS VERSION OF THIS GAME. it may not be perfect, but it is a masterpiece compared to this sorry excuse of a port.			"

												This might be worth a look as a curiosity if you're a fan of the DS version, or if you can pick it up on the cheap in a Steam sale, or you REALLY just want something else vaguely horror themed. Otherwise this is an incredibly mediocre horror game that looks and plays like the last decade of shooters never happened. It's also over really quickly (although in this case that might be more of a blessing than a curse). There's far better indie horror games out there.			"

												At this point I'm about 2/3 of the way through this and I have to say, I'm having  a pretty good time with it. Dementium II HD has a very 90s FPS feel to it. I'd describe it as Doom meets Silent Hill. On one hand you have the  FPS action of the classic Doom games, and on the other you have disturbing visuals in the likeness of the first Silent Hill. Graphically, it's not likely to win any awards. However, given that it was originally a Nintendo DS title, I'd say the developers did a pretty good job with it. The combat, at times, can be a bit repetitive. In many cases, you simply grab your shank and hack to your heart's content while circle strafing. There seems to be a decent enough enemy variety, though, to keep things flowing nicely. The bosses are gruesome looking. Absolutely disgusting. I've made my way through 3 of them and all 3 were a blast to hack, shoot, and smash to bloody bits. All in all, I'd say it's a pretty decent game for what it is. Certainly worth the $10 I paid for it. If a Doom/Silent Hill mix up seems like you're kind of thing, definitely give it a look.			"

												Although a fantastic DS game, they did little to really convert its controls to PC.  An atempt at balacing what would of been better mouse control aiming to them is making all the enemys take an amazing abuse from bullets, rendering almost all the weapons pointless outside of the shiv.

												Dementium II HD is definitely among the worst pieces of software which I have ever bought on steam. There are only a few games which made me wish there was refund system. You wake up in a mental hospital after a brain surgery. While you are trying to find out what has happened to you, you also attempt to remember why the heck you have bought the game. In the hospital you discover a lot of mustaches. Wait, what? Yes, right. Unfortunately Dementium II HD looks like a mediocre pre-2000 shooter (in HD!) and features horribly bad non-surround sound effects. This brilliant combination chokes off every piece of athmosphere. Enemies look like sketches from a psychopathic first-former and sound like someone emptying his bowels after 20 extra hot tacos. Sometimes I felt pity for them and ran away instead of killing them with one of the neat toy guns. The only class of enemies which made me feel a bit of discomfort is the warden. Imagine a hospital crawling with guards wearing all identical tremendous creepy mustaches, approaching you wagging their electric sticks on sight. Horrific. If you feel masochistic today and might consider buying this, let me quote the following meme: ""But wait, there's more!"" The gameply of DIIHD is awefully slow. Movement and weapon handling feel terribly sluggish. Additionally, the save point system is simply an impudence in a 2013 release. It even occured to me that on resuming a game I was put to the wrong save point, having to play through old parts again. Also, the developers take the ""HD"" pretty serious. They did not only put pre-2000 graphics in 1920x1080, they also made sure you do not use higher resolutions. If you dare to enable higher resolutions nonetheless, the HUD is rendered completely useless and several ""puzzles"" do not work anymore.My advice: If you feel the urge to try the game, at least play it on your DS. Maybe it's not as bad on thea small handheld device for which is was originally made.			"

Granted, I'll recommend this all day long for the DS, as it was originally intended, but this is an absolutely horrible port. I didn't expect it to be the next great horror game for PC, but I did expect something a bit more than a lazy port.If you can stand the sound, screen tearing (There is absolutely no anti-aliasing) and old-school controls, then by all means give it a try.

												I was really, really patient with this one.  I honestly was.  I even played it right up to what turned out to be - upon quick consultation of a walkthrough - a room mere MINUTES away from the final boss battle.  A room full of platforms one has to jump across, with fiery death awaiting just below.  A room which was not the first but the SECOND of such rooms, in quick succession to each other; in a game which had precisely NO tricky jumping bits PRIOR to these moments.  But most importantly...a room which was SEVERAL MINUTES away from the last save or check-point.  And what did I do?  I misjudged one of the jumps, and died.  And frankly, found myself lacking the will to try again.  EVER again.   Up until that point, I was going to sum this game up in one word:  ""Fine"".  No great shakes, certainly lacking in ambition...but y'know...""fine"".  ""Okay"".  ""Passable"".  And I'm still going to use those words, if only because when a game is this simplistic and repetitious, does it really matter that I didn't actually SUFFER through the final boss battle - which looked awfully like, y'know, a pretty standard final boss battle - and merely WATCHED it in a video walkthrough?  I don't think it would have enriched my life greatly to actually finish the game; though I do believe that passing on such an honour has left me short at least one whole Achievement.     Oh well.  Sometimes life is tough, but we must all endure.  Sometimes we must look our failures unerringly in the face, and say:  ""I am still a worthwhile human being.  Even though I lacked the patience to REPLAY THAT STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OF DEMENTIUM ♥♥♥♥ING II ♥♥♥♥ING HD, just to fight SOME ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID WORM CREATURE WHICH SOMEHOW, BAFFLINGLY CONSTITUTES THE FINAL NEMESIS OF A ""PSYCHOLOGICALLY""-THEMED HORROR GAME SET IN AN ASYLUM...does not mean that I am not a worthwhile entity in the scope of the greater universe.  I still have a valid contribution to make, even if it won't be GETTING THAT STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING ACHIEVEMENT.  But hey...I still have all the hair on my head.  And that's more important, to have a full head of hair than to TEAR IT ALL ♥♥♥♥ING OUT BECAUSE SOME STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING THRIFT-SHOP GAME DESIGNERS COULDN'T BE BOTHERED STICKING ANY ♥♥♥♥ING SAVE POINTS ANYWHERE NEAR THE END.  I am...still valid...worthwhile...deep breaths...deep breaths...""   Funny thing is, up to that point, one of my main ""complaints"" about the game was going to be that it was a tiny bit too easy.  I mean, I had 4 medkits and 14 bottles of pills on me when I died.  But did all this healing I'd saved up during the rest of the game save me from dying when I fell into the flames?  Noooooooo.  And what about that ridiculous amount of ammo I'd conserved...could I maybe use that to...FIGHT the flames as they devoured my body?  Noooooooooooooooooo.  Am I ever liable to play this rather shoddy (and not exactly ""HD""-looking) Nintendo DS port again?  ♥♥♥♥ nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.  And I wouldn't recommend anyone else doing so for the princely sum of fifteen dollars, either.  But if you're a glutton for punishment, and don't mind wasting a bunch of hours on a game haunted by the ghosts of the countless similar yet superior games which have trodden these well-worn floors so many times before, it might just be worth picking up in a sale for a fiver.  MIGHT.  The funeral is yours (or cremation, should you happen to die in the exact same spot that I did)...Verdict: 6.5/10.			"

												So im a HUGE Dementium fan and never got a chance to play the sequel on the DS up till a week ago, to be frank i liked the DS version more.I recommend the Dementium series to anyone but i also state, ""play the first one"" so unless you've done that new, people to the series i suggest the same thing otherwise you most likly wont get the plot. Which brings my first point why the 2nd game for a remake and not the first, come on guys thats a bad move as mentioned for new players in the series.Now the graphics aren't ""HD"" HD and more PS2 - pre xbox 360, the textures of mainly the creatures are not that great compared to the DS version, the enemys look  way too clean, unlike the DS version where they look menacing from being covered partially in blood and dirt. The actual cut scenes are way nicer looking and really makes the games graphic quality i mentioned show.The actual horror ambience is gone as you no longer need the flashlight, yeah even with the gamma and my screen brightness turned down i can see around the room clearly.Combat has some clunky lag when it comes to the hammer and knife but otherwise alright. Also the relics second function doesnt work. Also enemy difficulty is well easier with most of the enemys besides the freaking laughing guys, not sure of there name i think its ""hoppers"". By easier i mean you won't get hit much, the main concept of shooting the ""Chest-maws"" or for some ""Freaks"" heart dead centre for an insta kill is still there but besides that most enemys have a lag hit detect or death animationwhich is pretty annoying,same goesfor the monster sound effects, now its not my computer trust me when i say the sound/hit/ and death lags happenthey happen at RANDOM. Not all the time but at random. Now to the big main thing of Dementium that i loved it for, the tension, in this HD version its been removed, not sure if it was to welcome new players or what but this practically breakes the game. No pitch black rooms that limit your vision, no inventory limitations to make you make sure each shot counts so you don't have to go toe to toe and the bosses even on the hardest difficulty have been nerfed. The DS versions first boss on normal is alot more difficult to take out, even on the HD versions hardest difficulty the DS versions normal difficulty is harder. Also towards the end they added an un-necessary death pit at the only worst part of the game, sudden platforming, will waste 10 minutes of your time if you fall in it, originally youd just spawn back at the pit with some health damage but now you gotta walk all the way back.Another problem is the flash light being used with a duel hand weapon, in the DS version this was never possible, (in the first game you couldnt use a flash light and weapon at the same time) which means no need to try and find your nemy in the dark without your light.Another grip is the achievments, everyone knows they bugged out and 1 still is, another doesnt have enough ammo for the weapon to get the kills.Finally my ultimate problem with this is the missing survival mode, yeah new players who get the HD version you'r missing out.I stongly recommend you get the DS version, i recommend this if you can't locate the rare gem's but keep in mind the tag's should read, ""Action"" ""Indie"" ""Adventure"", since all horror element is gone.P.S. to those who have seen images of a duel weilding mingun creature thats concept art for a non-existent enemy so stop asking.

												Really generic story lineTries too hard to be like Doom and Amnesia, fails at both Controlls feel clunky, especially switching bewteen weapons Thought it'd be fun for a few jumpscares but it's so lacking it atmosphere it's not even remolety scary. You know you're playing a bad horror game when you have to actively chase the first boss around the arena rather than run away from it. Got bored after half an hour. Honestly, unless you are absolutley desperate to play it, I wouldn't reccomend.			"

												Sucks to say this game isn't as good as Dementium: The Ward or the original Dementium II. The bosses are nowhere near as difficult in the second one, and I'm hoping Memetic Games or better yet, Renegade Kid will recreate the original Dementium for PC.My main reasoning is because it isn't as scary; what made the original DS version scary is graphical limitations of the NDS, and not knowing what's around or near you, similar to the new Silent Hill complaints.Still worth picking up if you want a scary, cheap game.The game is easy to run, optimised, and was fun to play through again, I'll give this a positive review.

												Dementium II was a first person survival horror game on the Nintendo DS. I absolutely loved it, so I was excited upon hearing news of a HD PC port. This port however, turned out to be a disappointment. Poor, awkward controls (especially with the gun handling), and the choppy animations made combat dull while the cleaner ""HD"" graphics along just made the game look more cartoonish and took away the eerie atmosphere that the original had. There's also problems with graphic settings not saving, so you have to manually set that up every time you launch the game; not much of a problem of course, the game itself is relatively short, and the replay value is even lower than the original (it did not have a Survival mode the last time I played this port, and the original had one). Some achievements also don't work, so I advice achievement hunters to stray from this game.Overall, I found it to be a poor experience (especially compared to the original NDS game). I wouldn't recommend it at the original price of 15$, nor the current price of 10$. I do think it is worth a try when you see this game up on a sale, but fans of the series should prepare themselves for disappointment.EDIT: The review was actually just based off what I remember from a few months before typing this, and recently attempted the game so here are my thoughts: controls with mouse/keyboard are♥♥♥♥♥ poor framerates, and the soundtrack is good. Original thoughts still hold true.I did mention that some achievements don't work so if you get this game, then re-attempt from a checkpoint several times (if its a kill-count specific achievement; though this didn't work for me), and if that doesn't work, start a new game.

The controls are clunky, there was screen tearing left and right, and the sound sounded as if it was recorded straight from a DS... I played an hour before the headache forced me to quit. Granted, I'll recommend this all day long for the DS, as it was originally intended, but this is an absolutely horrible port. I didn't expect it to be the next great horror game for PC, but I did expect something a bit more than a lazy port.If you can stand the sound, screen tearing (There is absolutely no anti-aliasing) and old-school controls, then by all means give it a try. I'm just glad I didn't buy it at full price.			"

												So im a HUGE Dementium fan and never got a chance to play the sequel on the DS up till a week ago, to be frank i liked the DS version more.I recommend the Dementium series to anyone but i also state, ""play the first one"" so unless you've done that new, people to the series i suggest the same thing otherwise you most likly wont get the plot. Which brings my first point why the 2nd game for a remake and not the first, come on guys thats a bad move as mentioned for new players in the series.Now the graphics aren't ""HD"" HD and more PS2 - pre xbox 360, the textures of mainly the creatures are not that great compared to the DS version, the enemys look  way too clean, unlike the DS version where they look menacing from being covered partially in blood and dirt. The actual cut scenes are way nicer looking and really makes the games graphic quality i mentioned show.The actual horror ambience is gone as you no longer need the flashlight, yeah even with the gamma and my screen brightness turned down i can see around the room clearly.Combat has some clunky lag when it comes to the hammer and knife but otherwise alright. Also the relics second function doesnt work. Also enemy difficulty is well easier with most of the enemys besides the freaking laughing guys, not sure of there name i think its ""hoppers"". By easier i mean you won't get hit much, the main concept of shooting the ""Chest-maws"" or for some ""Freaks"" heart dead centre for an insta kill is still there but besides that most enemys have a lag hit detect or death animationwhich is pretty annoying,same goesfor the monster sound effects, now its not my computer trust me when i say the sound/hit/ and death lags happenthey happen at RANDOM. Not all the time but at random. Now to the big main thing of Dementium that i loved it for, the tension, in this HD version its been removed, not sure if it was to welcome new players or what but this practically breakes the game. No pitch black rooms that limit your vision, no inventory limitations to make you make sure each shot counts so you don't have to go toe to toe and the bosses even on the hardest difficulty have been nerfed. The DS versions first boss on normal is alot more difficult to take out, even on the HD versions hardest difficulty the DS versions normal difficulty is harder. Also towards the end they added an un-necessary death pit at the only worst part of the game, sudden platforming, will waste 10 minutes of your time if you fall in it, originally youd just spawn back at the pit with some health damage but now you gotta walk all the way back.Another problem is the flash light being used with a duel hand weapon, in the DS version this was never possible, (in the first game you couldnt use a flash light and weapon at the same time) which means no need to try and find your nemy in the dark without your light.Another grip is the achievments, everyone knows they bugged out and 1 still is, another doesnt have enough ammo for the weapon to get the kills.Finally my ultimate problem with this is the missing survival mode, yeah new players who get the HD version you'r missing out.I stongly recommend you get the DS version, i recommend this if you can't locate the rare gem's but keep in mind the tag's should read, ""Action"" ""Indie"" ""Adventure"", since all horror element is gone.P.S. to those who have seen images of a duel weilding mingun creature thats concept art for a non-existent enemy so stop asking.

												I was really, really patient with this one.  I honestly was.  I even played it right up to what turned out to be - upon quick consultation of a walkthrough - a room mere MINUTES away from the final boss battle.  A room full of platforms one has to jump across, with fiery death awaiting just below.  A room which was not the first but the SECOND of such rooms, in quick succession to each other; in a game which had precisely NO tricky jumping bits PRIOR to these moments.  But most importantly...a room which was SEVERAL MINUTES away from the last save or check-point.  And what did I do?  I misjudged one of the jumps, and died.  And frankly, found myself lacking the will to try again.  EVER again.   Up until that point, I was going to sum this game up in one word:  ""Fine"".  No great shakes, certainly lacking in ambition...but y'know...""fine"".  ""Okay"".  ""Passable"".  And I'm still going to use those words, if only because when a game is this simplistic and repetitious, does it really matter that I didn't actually SUFFER through the final boss battle - which looked awfully like, y'know, a pretty standard final boss battle - and merely WATCHED it in a video walkthrough?  I don't think it would have enriched my life greatly to actually finish the game; though I do believe that passing on such an honour has left me short at least one whole Achievement.     Oh well.  Sometimes life is tough, but we must all endure.  Sometimes we must look our failures unerringly in the face, and say:  ""I am still a worthwhile human being.  Even though I lacked the patience to REPLAY THAT STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OF DEMENTIUM ♥♥♥♥ING II ♥♥♥♥ING HD, just to fight SOME ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID WORM CREATURE WHICH SOMEHOW, BAFFLINGLY CONSTITUTES THE FINAL NEMESIS OF A ""PSYCHOLOGICALLY""-THEMED HORROR GAME SET IN AN ASYLUM...does not mean that I am not a worthwhile entity in the scope of the greater universe.  I still have a valid contribution to make, even if it won't be GETTING THAT STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING ACHIEVEMENT.  But hey...I still have all the hair on my head.  And that's more important, to have a full head of hair than to TEAR IT ALL ♥♥♥♥ING OUT BECAUSE SOME STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING THRIFT-SHOP GAME DESIGNERS COULDN'T BE BOTHERED STICKING ANY ♥♥♥♥ING SAVE POINTS ANYWHERE NEAR THE END.  I am...still valid...worthwhile...deep breaths...deep breaths...""   Funny thing is, up to that point, one of my main ""complaints"" about the game was going to be that it was a tiny bit too easy.  I mean, I had 4 medkits and 14 bottles of pills on me when I died.  But did all this healing I'd saved up during the rest of the game save me from dying when I fell into the flames?  Noooooooo.  And what about that ridiculous amount of ammo I'd conserved...could I maybe use that to...FIGHT the flames as they devoured my body?  Noooooooooooooooooo.  Am I ever liable to play this rather shoddy (and not exactly ""HD""-looking) Nintendo DS port again?  ♥♥♥♥ nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.  And I wouldn't recommend anyone else doing so for the princely sum of fifteen dollars, either.  But if you're a glutton for punishment, and don't mind wasting a bunch of hours on a game haunted by the ghosts of the countless similar yet superior games which have trodden these well-worn floors so many times before, it might just be worth picking up in a sale for a fiver.  MIGHT.  The funeral is yours (or cremation, should you happen to die in the exact same spot that I did)...Verdict: 6.5/10.			"

												It's time to face facts.This game looks like an fps creator game. However, graphics aside, the port devs did a surprisingly good job getting the atmosphere to work. The enemies feel just like the first game, and the game does make me scared. However, the worst part of this port is the baby maggots. They no longer cry like babies, they squeak. I hate that. The crying is what makes the maggots the most terrifying enemies in the game!However, the game doesn't really get scary until after the first boss, when you start to see the bad guys in the real world.Mind you, I'm saying this as somebody who played the original Dementium: The WardDon't expect any story or much graphics. It's simply a recreation of the second game on pc. However, I would have preferred to see the first game on pc, as that one was terrifying.If you're an oldschool gamer like me who can stand bad graphics, then you'll probably enjoy this game. However, if you haven't played the ds classic, then you'll probably be better off giving this game a miss.			"

												Maybe it's because I never played the first game but I felt the story was severely lacking, nothing is EVER explained, why is he in the hospital? What happend to his wife and daughter? We are tasked with escaping and chasing this mad doctor who happens to spew nonsense (to me) and that ending, seriously? I played all that for that end? I hardly felt anything was scary here.Clearly there was some inspiration taken from Silent Hill, you can almost feel the presence of an atmosphere (real/nightmare world, mind tricks, bleak settings) too bad that's all i felt, a fleeting presence.Graphics are okay for a port from the DS. As for the music, was there even music in this game other than the starting screen? if there was forgive me cause it hardly made a impression on me.Now comes the combat and gameplay, see the real horror lies here, not in the story. Awkward movements, buggy combat and controls and those 3 platforms areas you need to jump across at the end? Absolutely terrible gameplay design, the jump mechanic is horrible and I play 2D platformers, just lazy from the developers. Also some achievements are buggy, i had to redo a couple of em to actually get them to register.Is this a good game? No, but if you're bored and/or you're a survival horror fan like me then by all means give this a try, it can be finished in a couple of hours (if you're not a achievement buff and even that isn't hard) just be sure to get this on a sale or in a bundle, this game is not worth the full price.

												This isn't a bad game, exactly. It was originally made for the Nintendo DS, and while the graphics have gotten an upgrade to (modern?) standards, the action hasn't. It plays terribly for a PC game, probably worse than a game from the middle of the Doom era. Like, Duke Nukem 3d has better gameplay than this. I like that they ported it, but I wish they had done some kind of work to improve it other than graphical upgrades.If you're really really dead set on this horror aesthetic, play Cry of Fear.			"

												I will start by saying that this game did, at times, manage to be a little suspensful.  I will also say that the people who made this game have my respect for actually putting this out there.  With that out of the way; this game looks like it came out twelve years ago.  The sound is poorly done.  The gameplay is plodding, and the combat is  clunky.  The enemies are more annoying than scary.  The ""puzzles"" are either childishly easy, or can simply be clicked around until solved at random.  In some ways this game calls to mind Ed Wood.  Someone with no storytelling talent, directoral ability, or artistic vision who nevertheless managed to make some absolutely terrible movies that people still watch. So, is this game bad?  Yes.  Is it Hilariously bad?  Also yes.  Do I recommend you play it?  Well, if you like awful movies, maybe give it a shot.			"

												Rating - 19/100Recommendation - Not even worth it if it's freeThis game is TERRIBLE. The graphics are a joke (it's a port of a DS game), the sound effects are pathetically bad, the music is annoying and repetitive (the ""battle"" music is literally a 4-second loop of a single string instrument), the enemies are janky and annoying, the combat is clanky and clunky, the voice acting is cheesy and lame (and incredibly low bitrate), there's a loading screen EVERY ROOM, and the game is even buggy and glitchy!!The level design is sub-par, the action is sub-par, the scares are sub-par, the bosses are sub-par, the enemies are sub-par, and the plot is sub-par. There is nothing redeemable about this game at all. Playing this game will make you question what went wrong in your life. If I were trapped on a desert island with just this game, I would spend my time counting grains of sand.			"

												this game is gonna be a fantastic game once it is finished. the game runs smothly at times, the frame rate drops abit when there is an enemie nere by and when in combat, but that can easily be dissmised but once it hits the first boss it is quite clunky and laggy but i got passed it after many trys. the graphics are brilliant for a ds port, lots of options to suit your pc.the game also has a brilliant sound track to set the mood of the game.once it is finished this game is gonna be awesome so i would get it if i was YOU.

												First let me start by saying I haven't beaten the game. I'm a huge fan of Horror Games and my favorite is Condemned: Criminal Origins. I haven't found one that scares me the way Condemned did when I was 12. Imagine my excitement when I'm told by a friend that this game is a million times better than Condemned. I mean I bought this at full price. Without even checking the reviews.I was excited!Well apparently it didn't run on my old hand-me-down 16-bit windows 95 eMachine from my grandparents. So I had to wait. I built up in my head what this game would be and I waited and waited until I built my own computer that is, well not perfect, but the best I can afford at $10/hour. I nearly forgot about this game, but last night during a fit of insomnia I stumbled across it and decided it was time. After so long it was like a sign from God, this game is...TERRIBLE!Pro's:The graphics can be passible on the highest settings. Plus the game definatly leaves you feeling insane because you're still bothering to play it.Con's:The music makes you want to drive a nail through your skull because its the same five mother-loving notes on an eternal loop that sound like they've been ripped from a $1-store Halloween CD.The story is lack luster.The voice overs are so terrible that I feel like not even Satan himself speaking russian backwards could make it creepy.

												The game was 90% off during the sales and I still regret buying it. It's THAT bad.Honestly, I was surprised because I read many positive comments about this game. I knew it was one of the most famous survival-horror on the Nintendo DS. Well maybe it is a good game on DS. But on PC, this is really bad.The gameplay itself lacks any feelings or originality. The combat is very repetitive, and I was never really amused or being scared.The graphics are horrible. I know it was originally a DS game, but right now it is a ""HD"" PC game (look at the title) sold for 10 bucks. Even Half-Life 1 in 1998 still looks better. It's not just about the technical aspect, even the art direction is bad. All the environments feel extremely empty, the lighting is ugly, the animations are laughable.All the sound effects are very cheap. I especially like the combat music : it's a 3 seconds loop!! I'm not joking. 3 seconds. Even on the NES, there were many games with longer loops.Also this PC port is full of bugs. Just take a look on the online complaints.This game kinda reminds me of Cry of Fear. But CoF was infinitely better, and it was free.			"

												I've played the first one on the Nintendo DS, gave me a scare for gfameplay and all, so when i saw this game on sale i gave it a shot.Playing it for a while, I gotten lost for a while, got very repetitive with the enemies making it difficult to kill, epecially using a gun, story wise is creative picking up after William has his brain surgery and confromting his choices of murdering his wife is now up in some whacky assylum/prison hell of nightmare.Long story short I would not recommend playing this game, if it is on sale and you wanna try it go for it but just be thankful there are steam refunds.

												I don't want to start off with a pun but the best way I can describe Dementium 2 HD is ""extremely demented""You start at an Insane Asylum and you'll most likely assume you're playing a character who is a nutjob. That's all I'm going to say, you can figure out the rest when you buy and play the game. Anywho I understand there is alot of freeze up on the game but that's because the game is originally a DS game and it was ported to PC. There are some guides that will help you solve the problem.(You guys might want me to say the answer so I'll make it quick.) Play the game on a small windowed screen and DON'T PLAY THE GAME ON FULL SCREEN OR YOU'LL MOST LIKELY HAVE GAME FREEZE UPS! Anyways I like the game in my honest opinion because its horror elements, adventures, atmospheric environments, and the game kinda has that Silent Hill vibe to it which I really like! I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is into adventure horror games!			"

												Quick things to say.-Its a DS Port to PC, I understands its not PC standards.-Graphics are not amazing are on par with the 2013 crowd.-Controls can be clunky and odd for Keboard and Gamepad.-Not much options for People who have much more insane modern monitors.That out of the way I want to say a few things. IN My perspective this game was amazing when I got it on Release back in 2010 on the Nintendo DS. The first game Dementium: The Ward was surprising at the time being that not many FPS were on the DS NOR Was Rated M like games like this. There was much you could do with a engine like on the hardware of the DS but what they did do was amazing and set up a very impressive atmsophere At the time it was release.the Same latter was with this game. Regardless if it was 10 or the sale 1 dollar. I will say straight This MAY NOT INTEREST YOU AT ALL. I understand most of you will be turned away by the graphics, PC standards, crashing (which has not happen to me as of now) or complaining that killing a monster with a knife is a terrible way to start a horror game. The game is fine. To me you will have a nice experience depending on how you take it in.Controls are clunky and feel like you take a Extra step when holding your moving down. Mouse Sense feel very odd at times with no numbers representing the section. and Granted Tediaces movement that is REALLY straight forward but I will say that if you havent played the first Dementium, that was even more so. Especially when it was easy to cheat the game once you know a passcode to a power sniper.It works its nice, I was not expecting it at all. However I honestly wish they wouldh ave Redone the first and second game to make a more immersive experience and a better story telling of whats going on between the two. Besides that It may not be a game you would love but just like some games. You Dont Have to like them all. If you feel its worth it regardless, then go for it. but for most people who play Counter Strike, or Dota 2. I will say this is not a game you would like and more so complain how its the worst on steam etc, etc, etc.			"

												Not perfect, but not horrid either. Story is not the most intresting,  but I seen worse *Cough *F.E.A.R. 3 *Cough* >.> , don't expect high end gameplay, graphics, or scares as it is a originally a DS game. Dementium 2  holds some insperation from Silent hill, (which im all for since silent hill is my favorite game series, Silent hill 2 being my favorite game of all time.) Dementium 2 is around 5 hours of gameplay, so save it for a rainy day. nothing special, but it's a nice little game. Without spoiling anything, il just list some pros and cons in my opinion.-Pros--controls for a DS port are not that bad-good for a time waster, or a rainy day game-simple graphics that run fine on average computers- puzzels, simple and easy, but you can't have a horror game without puzzels, and some of them I ended up saying are kinda clever. - (optional) if you like the horrer genre, but not getting the♥♥♥♥♥♥scared out of you, this one isn't that scarry- chest maws are pretty creepy, if only todays graphics were imployed, that would have been amazing- around 5 hours of gameplay, not too short and not to long.-some insperations from Silent Hill-cons--(optional) not scary enough in my opinion-weapons deal roughly around the same damage, or atleast don't make much of a diffrence, you can go through the whole game using your default knife, except for the last boss.-repetitive backtracking-Somewhat of a confusing story, they just jump you right in.-boss battles are not that inovative, ones a hack and slash boss, anothers a shot at a week spot, another is run for ur life taking pop shots on down time, ect ect... though the second boss was kinda cool, but roughly, same boss machanics found in other games- linier world-wibbaly wobbaly crosshair-dumb AIVerdictScore 6.5/10Average horror game that has room for improvement, but has cought my eye. lower your perfect standerds, and just play it for what it is. save it for a rainy day. :3			"

												  The horror genre is dying, unfortunately, it's a very sad fact. Not only in cinematography, but in the whole industry of video games as well. The golden era of horrors is gone. It's been a long time since we've beaten AvP Gold on Director's Cut; discovered the horrible truth of the Covenant family; helped Torque make the right choice in the Baltimore County; saved Earth with Tommy Domasi; barely escaped R'lyeh with detective Jack Walters; fought alongside with young Simon through his darkest nightmares; survived Leafmore High School terror ... The list goes on, for each of us it's different, but we all have something to remember. I've never been to Silent Hill though. Yes, my bad, i regret it very much, too.   But now it's 2016 and i have nothing to play. It's not like i'm asking for a lot, no. Just a simple thriller/shooter. Maybe with a bit of a psychological horror and survival aspects. But i look at the Steam store and what do i see? Acidic pixel ""shooters"" that have the highest ratings. 2-D Mario-like crap. Minecraft. Filled with agonizing pathos CoD games. Spoiled and ♥♥♥♥ed up AAA titles. All sorts of crap. Then i see something like ""A Horrible Horror of a Chainsaw Bloodshed Alien Killer Massive Massacre Gore Zombie Badass Shooting Shooter"". I click on it, expecting a nice horror at least, or a cool shooter. And what do i see? A pixel Top-Down game. With highest ratings. And then i realize, that this is it, it's all lost. The genre is practically dead. It's over. The plastic world has won. Noble metal statues and rose-wood masterpieces made with love and care and attention are covered in dust and left forgotten on the shelves of history. Soulless synthetic has replaced the creations of love, mind and talent obeying today's poor taste of a common buyer. The nowadays' generation doesn't need good action horrors, they don't want to be scared. They want to sit there and play addictive acidic ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tasteless meaningless stupid crap. Or pseudo-detective fashionable ""camera horrors"". Cheap jumpscares and nothing more.   Deep dark stories are not wanted anymore, they are not welcome in today's world. This generation doesn't want a dark action horror with a complicated character, they want simulators. Simulators of fishing, hunting, crafting, building, video taping, of taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥ They are drifting out of touch, and it's more and more visible. Sometimes, very rarely, a single decent horror/action appears. Once in a few years probably. But rarely it happens, and even more rarely it's something playable and enjoyable. The latest one on my mind was Alien Isolation. A good, decent game. But i heard it didn't sell so well, so the sequel is under a big question.  Suddenly i feel scared. I drink, i drink more, i get almost drunk. I start Dementium II. I'm a patient in a psychiatric hospital that looks more like a prison. Guards bring in another inmate, the doctors in white robes discuss something. Are they talking about me? Suddenly i pass out. I wake up, i'm in a cell. Something's wrong, very wrong, the door's open. Why is the sky red? Why does that moving wall look like a giant guillotine? An ugly undescribable creature with a giant mouth full of sharp teeth run through the corridor. My inmate is delirious, looks like he's lost his mind. I grab a shank. The feeling of a weapon in my hand calms, even though i know i'm alone here, surrounded by monsters. I know what to do, i've been here before, walked these floors, i feel safe here within these ugly walls, surrounded by death, madness and misery. I'm ready, i feel good here. I'm home, again. C'mon you ♥♥♥♥ers, come and get me.			"

 Dementium II HD (?) So, this is my very first review but I am not here to write about my experience, I am here to talk about the game itself.It's kind of unfair  misjudging the game by its reviews, you need to play it in order to know.Basically, recommendations are based in gameplay, game experience, replay value and this time I am going to consider the price, so lets start.In the title I wrote (?). The game has 720/1080 etc, but graphics are really bad, overall a good job considering that it is just a port from NDS and we all know that graphics are a plus, good games not necessary come with good graphics.It does not have replay value, since you are just going to finish the game once, probably twice and that's all.Bugs are not going to have major impact in the gameplay, you can finish the game without problems. It took me 5 hours to finish the game, I bought it with 90% off ... so yeah, it was worth it.I strongly recommend the game. Plot is nothing special, enemies are tough enough,   stages are amazing  and bosses are just fine but try to get it with discount. The game its overpriced, but if you can afford it and you don't mind to spend 10 bucks in a really short game that should be cheaper, go ahead.  "

												I love this DS to PC transition. I no longer own a DS, so now I can play one of my favorite games from the comfort of my laptop. It's not good, or scary, but it is fun.			"

												Not as bad as eveyones saying. Yes the graphics aren't that good but its a very good game. It's scary and has a lot of jump scares. If you ever played Outlast that is based in an asylum you should try this out. Also I like how it adds the scary scenes. I recommend trying it out its worth the price!			"

												A fun horror/fps experience, with a bit of puzzle solving thrown in. I'd recomend it as it is a nice experience and has an intresting story, but it does have quite a few flaws.- Really Short- Really Easy- Glitchy Achivements!!!!			"

												Not perfect but better than the norm of find 8 pages and run.I would have liked it more if the game was longer and maybe a little more wepon variety, mostly I just used the knife and it got me through the game.I'de pay for a Dementium III but only if it were truely polished from what was layed down here.$10? Only if you really like the visuals.Otherwise wait for a sale and 3 hours of free time.			"

												   Technical difficulty solutions first, game review second.   Let me begin by saying I had problems running this game on windows 7. It continually crashed upon starting until I went into the computer folder for this game, checked properties, & found it was 'set' to run on windows XP, changed that to windows 7 & now game starts fine.   Another problem that needs fixing every time you start the game is video resolution from options menu. I set mine to 1280x720 because it fits screen, be mindful that certain resolutions cut out images/text, you know your res is right when you can read the full text [Reset to Default] instead of seeing [et to Defa].   Last problem before I address gameplay, playing in fullscreen, it works great in-game after turning it on...until you turn game off & return to play later -it goes back to windowed mode. Go to options, you'll find fullscreen mode IS SELECTED & the [Apply] button is not visible, don't panic. Change the resolution in order to make the [Apply] button appear & set fullscreen, then change res to reapply desired res.Review:Gameplay:4/10Controls:9/10Visual:5/10Audio:8/10   Gameplay: I own 'Dementium: The Ward' for DS from which this game is a sequel. That said, the enemies are similar & equally aggressive for your blood, they will lock you in rooms at times and force you to fight wave after wave until victory or death. Half of the puzzles you have to find clues to solve, the other half are too easy. The game is also very short compared to the DS version.   Controls: They made the controls very proper for a FPS, hotkeys for all your weapons, looking at map pauses game, you can remap the keys to your liking. Only thing i didn't like was the lack of hotkey for health items.   Visual: I rated this low because the game has HD in it's name & the only times this quality ever occurs is during cutscenes. Otherwise the game has a creepy appearance of sanity twisting, blood covered iron in between lucid moments of roaming a prison for the criminally insane. Aside from that, if an enemy is visually reeling from a bullet you just put into it & you shoot it again, it will occasionally pass through to the wall.   Audio: I enjoyed the music and sound effects as they are straight out of the DS version I know so well. The worms still squeel, the bonesaw still has that satifying grate, & the dissembodied heads still scream in anguish just like they always do. That said, the main character never speaks, & the main villian never shows any emotion after revealing his true colors. Sad really, I wanted to hear his triumph, his fustration, his fear...or at least throw me a maniacle laugh, SOMETHING!   I would recommend this game if you like horror shooting games & catch it on sale like I did, or if you've played Dementium: The Ward (not required to enjoy though)			"

												A alright game coming originally from the Nintendo DS.  As a port itself, the game gives a creepy atmosphere of what you expect from any horror asylum theme; not to mention for a low price and trading card set.I do have to admit that the game can be slow at times in terms of running speed as well as questionable weapon damage from common enemies to bosses, but other than that, great game!As my first Perfect game with all achievemnts, 8.5/10!

												Ho boy, where to even begin...This game, in terms of design, is HORRIBLE! Enemies take inconsistant amount of hits; sometimes they die after 4-5 hits, sometimes they die after 7-8, regardless of what weapon type you're using! They also make some of the most ANNOYING sounds I have ever heard an enemy make in a video game, by far! You're often transfered into this demonic parallel universe (or what ever the hell it is) and forced to fight off waves of demons for absolutely no reason. (Might pertain to the plot, but it seems unclear.) And no, I'm not talking about the ghosts that transition you to this stage if/when you're caught by them. Those are yet another nuisance. So the game goes from being a somewhat scary/creepy survival horror game, to an agitating, repetitive chore to play through very quickly! In fact, do you want to know what the scariest thing about this game is? Having to play through it again from the very beginning! In conclusion, do I reccomend this game? HELL NO! Do I recommend buying it on sale? Hell no! Would I recommend buying it for someone as a gift? Yes, but only for someone you secretly hate and would like to torture immensely! In fact I would've gotten a refund if I could, unfortunately I bought the CD key from another website for 90 cents...and I still feel ripped off.			"

												Hd is only a upgrade of texture and look from the DS version but don't hope Battelfield 3 look. Else if character and weapons look from 2003 the background is enough good graphicaly. Game is quick finish in medium don't try yet in hard but i finish with 1 weapons missing (maybe it's normal) in 6 hours.Gameplay is very good and you really feel in a survival.The game is really inspired by the movie Jacob's Ladder like silent Hill was (monster, asylum, normal and dark world)Finaly A real survival horror who make remind  the good time of resident evil 1 and Silent hill but in fps view cause of monster to kill and enigme (i'm not a fan of the suvival horror like amnesia cause i find that too easy to use the fear of get no weapons).

												  The horror genre is dying, unfortunately, it's a very sad fact. Not only in cinematography, but in the whole industry of video games as well. The golden era of horrors is gone. It's been a long time since we've beaten AvP Gold on Director's Cut; discovered the horrible truth of the Covenant family; helped Torque make the right choice in the Baltimore County; saved Earth with Tommy Domasi; barely escaped R'lyeh with detective Jack Walters; fought alongside with young Simon through his darkest nightmares; survived Leafmore High School terror ... The list goes on, for each of us it's different, but we all have something to remember. I've never been to Silent Hill though. Yes, my bad, i regret it very much, too.   But now it's 2016 and i have nothing to play. It's not like i'm asking for a lot, no. Just a simple thriller/shooter. Maybe with a bit of a psychological horror and survival aspects. But i look at the Steam store and what do i see? Acidic pixel ""shooters"" that have the highest ratings. 2-D Mario-like crap. Minecraft. Filled with agonizing pathos CoD games. Spoiled and ♥♥♥♥ed up AAA titles. All sorts of crap. Then i see something like ""A Horrible Horror of a Chainsaw Bloodshed Alien Killer Massive Massacre Gore Zombie Badass Shooting Shooter"". I click on it, expecting a nice horror at least, or a cool shooter. And what do i see? A pixel Top-Down game. With highest ratings. And then i realize, that this is it, it's all lost. The genre is practically dead. It's over. The plastic world has won. Noble metal statues and rose-wood masterpieces made with love and care and attention are covered in dust and left forgotten on the shelves of history. Soulless synthetic has replaced the creations of love, mind and talent obeying today's poor taste of a common buyer. The nowadays' generation doesn't need good action horrors, they don't want to be scared. They want to sit there and play addictive acidic ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tasteless meaningless stupid crap. Or pseudo-detective fashionable ""camera horrors"". Cheap jumpscares and nothing more.   Deep dark stories are not wanted anymore, they are not welcome in today's world. This generation doesn't want a dark action horror with a complicated character, they want simulators. Simulators of fishing, hunting, crafting, building, video taping, of taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥ They are drifting out of touch, and it's more and more visible. Sometimes, very rarely, a single decent horror/action appears. Once in a few years probably. But rarely it happens, and even more rarely it's something playable and enjoyable. The latest one on my mind was Alien Isolation. A good, decent game. But i heard it didn't sell so well, so the sequel is under a big question.  Suddenly i feel scared. I drink, i drink more, i get almost drunk. I start Dementium II. I'm a patient in a psychiatric hospital that looks more like a prison. Guards bring in another inmate, the doctors in white robes discuss something. Are they talking about me? Suddenly i pass out. I wake up, i'm in a cell. Something's wrong, very wrong, the door's open. Why is the sky red? Why does that moving wall look like a giant guillotine? An ugly undescribable creature with a giant mouth full of sharp teeth run through the corridor. My inmate is delirious, looks like he's lost his mind. I grab a shank. The feeling of a weapon in my hand calms, even though i know i'm alone here, surrounded by monsters. I know what to do, i've been here before, walked these floors, i feel safe here within these ugly walls, surrounded by death, madness and misery. I'm ready, i feel good here. I'm home, again. C'mon you ♥♥♥♥ers, come and get me.			"

												I prefer older-school FPS horror games myself. Dementium II feels like aged FPS horror games like the Suffering, although I wouldn't compare the two. Virtually no jump-scares here. Rather, the game plays like a haunted house, with spooky ambience and a handful of creepy enemies. Lots of blood on the floor and dead bodies.I liked the atmosphere of the game. The environments were very old-school in design. The sound design was what creeped me out the most. All of the monsters / enemies are very disturbing, mostly due to their sfx. The first two bosses had very unsettling sound effects which made the fights pretty intense. Heavy, spooky ambient noises permeate the game and provide some sense of dread. The background music is also very old-school, like Resident Evil 2.The developers threw in a slight potential for backtracking / exploring to find better weapons, secret areas etc. so there is that.However, there were a lot of things about this game that really disappointed me. The weapons system is weird; apparently an early-game enemy can take 4 shotgun blasts without going down but a mere prison shank can dispatch it in a couple of seconds. There is not enough ammo in the game to truly enjoy shooting higher-level weapons like the machine gun. Most of the boss fights I ended up just using the shank to beat them. Also, there is a major weapon that the main character assembles over the course of the game, and when it's complete, it doesn't do anything special (from what I could tell). However, whomping monsters with your sledgehammer is quite satisfying.The enemy AI is wonky and you shouldn't expect to fight more than 3 enemies at a time. When you kill them, a new wave of baddies will spawn. Rinse, repeat. Not very challenging there.But I guess my biggest complaint is that there is a complete lack of coherent story, the ending sucked and the game was too short (I took my time and beat it in 6 hours). I know nothing about the main character or what's going on.So in conclusion, yes I do recommend this game, but really only if you're a young gamer with little experience playing horror games. Try it out if you're looking for a quick classic horror game fix.			"

OverviewBefore I started Dementium II HD, I didn’t know that it was originally a 3DS game. I’m always intrigued when you see a 3DS game come to PC (or even a console), because I’m curious as to how it translates. The last game I played on PC that was a 3DS port was Resident Evil Revelations, and it was pretty decent.Unfortunately, Dementium II HD is not as good a port. I didn’t play it on 3DS, so I have absolutely no opinion on how it was before, but as a PC release, it’s…not so good. It has its moments, but is overall a subpar game in what is already a crowded genre.Disclaimer: I played for roughly 90 minutes, in which time I got through the village, collected the dagger and returned to the prison, going through it a little bit, before I decided not to keep going. The remainder of the time was letting the game run to collect the trading cards from it.ProsStory seems decent and is interesting to see progressFairly lengthy, should take you a couple of hoursConsThe game is ugly, which can be somewhat explained because of it being a port, but still it’s pretty badAnimations are clunky, especially when firing the revolver; I have never seen a handgun kickback the way that doesMusic is repetitive and has obvious loop points, such as when it cuts abruptly, only to start back upModels are all the same; the guards in the prison all use the exact same model, which would be explained if the prison were staffed by clones, but that is not the case. I suppose this could also be a limitation because it’s a port (based on the 3DS’ limited capacity), but it’s called HD, it should try to be thatEnemies are uninspired and repetitive; the creature with the gaping mouth on its chest are the most common, and they all look alike, not even a color variationVoices, whether it’s the foreign speaking prisoners or the guards all sound phoned in, with a weird echo sometimes; the guy who speaks to you over the speaker is the only decent actorThe exploration horror aspect is ruined by the inclusion of those ridiculous horde segments, where you have to fight a group of monsters before being allowed to continue; it breaks immersionVery predictable; big open room with a few cases of ammo and an item you need to open a door? You just know what that means: boss fight!SummaryIt might be potentially unfair to review this as a PC game, based on its source material and the limitations of the system. But, the developer has called it HD, which would imply that it’s been improved, at least somewhat, for PC.That does not seem to be the case. Which is a shame, because it looks like Dementium II has a good story to tell. But, if unlike me, you’ve played and beaten the 3DS version, you likely already know the story, so it may not be a big deal.			"

												i was one of the people who pre-ordered this game , i love scary games and i heard so much about this game on the nintendo ds , the price was reasonable and i could easily see from the screenshots that the ''HD'' part was true , i waited a whole month for release , counting the days and then i played it.Boy , i wasn't dissapointed , what it lacks from jump-scares it easily justify with mood and the downright grotesque , the enemies are varied , the animation smooth , the story is fresh and the atmosphere is so tense.shades of KING'S FIELD and SHADOW TOWER are in it and that is one thing i loved.the game is a bit short and the last level is just cannon fodder of enemies and some tricky jumps but otherwise , the game rocks and i recomment any fan of the macabre to check it out and it is reasonably priced.i give it a solid 8/10 and i hope to see more of the series.

												If like me you've played Dementium II on the Nintendo DS a few years back and liked it, be advised: this is EXACTLY the same game and same feel you'll get playing this HD version on PC. Although graphics are not that good by today's standards (polygons count is low and textures are a bit bland), I assume they may have been left ''simple'' on purpose, as to not stray too far from the DS version yet feel more polished. Controls are floaty and hit detection is not perfect (although ennemies will turn red to indicate they're taking damages). Difference between walking and running is hard to notice but is nonetheless needed at some points in the game. In the end, since I haven't finished the game at the time, I'm glad I picked it up on sale for $ 1.00. Would not have paid 10 bucks for it. Also, french being my primary language, I can't say I was too impressed with the translation, so I can imagine other languages included in the game must have typos or syntax errors as well.BUY IF:-you liked the DS version and want to experience it again on a bigger screen with higher def and better textures.-it's on sale for $ 5.00 or less (as a bonus....piece of advice...)DON'T BUY IF:-you expect a rehashed version of the game with crisp graphics and revamped gameplay-you never played a DS game in your life and hope this game is a worthy contender in the FPS horror genre (the first F.E.A.R game does a better job at it and cost around the same.)

												Believe it or not, the gameplay is more solid on the DS than PC.  Half the time, when you press your attack button, it doesn't register, so you can't reliably perform quick 2 hit strikes, or 3 hit strikes with your melee weapons.  There are also several other differences between this and the original that can make for quite different experiences.  Generally the differences are negative...but...if you can hammer to your head that it's a remake of a NINTENDO DS game, you can find some entertainment here.  Somewhere.			"

												If like me you've played Dementium II on the Nintendo DS a few years back and liked it, be advised: this is EXACTLY the same game and same feel you'll get playing this HD version on PC. Although graphics are not that good by today's standards (polygons count is low and textures are a bit bland), I assume they may have been left ''simple'' on purpose, as to not stray too far from the DS version yet feel more polished. Controls are floaty and hit detection is not perfect (although ennemies will turn red to indicate they're taking damages). Difference between walking and running is hard to notice but is nonetheless needed at some points in the game. In the end, since I haven't finished the game at the time, I'm glad I picked it up on sale for $ 1.00. Would not have paid 10 bucks for it.

												I would argue that this game is a fairly good port from the ds. it works with a controller, not that i would recomend it seeing as the ds touch pad is more of a mouse pad and the crosshair is rather squirly when aiming. the AI is not great, but it never really was. enimies will either walk, stop, then attack, or fly at you with reckless abandon. the game will still challenge you at higher diffs and maybe even creep you out at times. if you are expecting high fps shooting action, then you may want to look elsewhere. its more of a survial horror throw back taking ALOT of influence from silent hill. so much so that you could argue that it is down right ripping it off. You will need to rely on melee mostly rather than going guns blazing into any given room. even when you are in situations you'll be shooting in, the guns can feel serverly underpowered (namely the shotgun). All in all, if you are looking for an okay survival horror game and are on a budget, this game may be for you. its puzzles are not going to bend your brain, and its control can be alittle finiky, but it isnt a bad game by any means. better on the ds, okay on pc. check it out.

												This is a rare tresure that I am sure others will enjoy. This game somehow combines a decent story, great gameplay, and nice clean graphics. The story is very, well, Lovecraft fashion of your character being in a hospital, which was previously a prison, which was previousl an asylum. The scares in this game have a very wide variety anything from jump to disturbing scares are seen. However you ALWAYS feel uncomfortable, which is good. combat is well balanced and there is no shortage of ammo if your careful. You are not trying so hard to find a specific item, they are displayed so that you WILL see them, and very smooth gameplay. All around this is a game that really needs praising, a rare tresure amoung horror games that apeals to all them fans of all diffrent kinds of scares. ENJOY!			"

												First of all, I'll base my review of the original game on nds and this port.Don't expect too much scares of this game, you know when you'll encounter ennemies because of the musical that'll change at thé start of the fight.For some person it's an huge flaw but imo what you search in this game is the creepyness and the insanity that emanes from this game.The soundtrack is great, the ennemies are disturbing AF and the story is overall nice.Unfortunately this game has a lot of flaws.It's quite easy, short and the ending felt rushed.The gameplay is... quite boring, and they removed the survival mode  (which wasn't that great anyway).Overall, its not a good game nor a bad one. The first dementium is way better than this one and it's a shame that they didn't released it on pc.I think you should try it out, it deserves better than a 37/100.			"

												I feel like this game was made by a bunch of amateurs on the unity engine (I have nothing against Unity, it's a great engine if used well but you know what I mean) I am unable to finish the game due to the dagger door glitch (a known glitch that still isn't fixed, and probably never will be). It's the first time I am unable to finish a game because of such a stupid glitch.About the game itself: You play as a guy who has ♥♥♥♥♥♥s when looking at red mirrors. Perhaps that's the reason he ended up in an asylum. As you progress you'll encounter annoying and terribly designed monsters (they somehow managed to make them less scary than their DS counterpart...). Fighting them isn't fun nor scary. All you have to do is to hit them while walking backwards, this way they'll never be able to hit you unless they somehow manage to corner you. The game atmosphere is boring and bland and every room feels empty. The original game was great but this port is just terrible. "

												You start up by 'waking up' from a coma, and after that the nurse enject you with something as the Prison Guards grabs a hold of you and transfer's you back to the cell.After this you 'meet' your cell mate which is rabbling something wierd, could honestly never figure it out.After you have 'explored' the cell you'll see a post card and read that.This triggers the prison guard to close all cells and light's to turn off. I was just wondring what the hell that happend.Anyhow, you get dragged into a nightmare or something I can't really tell what it is. After that has happend, your cell mate is strapped to the cell wall and his face is ripped off from his face.You turn around and you see the cell door turning into a big meat axe.That's just the intro. Anyhow I got no clue what was going on. You walk around the phsyco clinic and you attack several guards. The game itself it's really good, the engine has it flawsses same goes for the error in the game.The really negative thing about this game is that, if you press MM2 and do something like interact at the same time it will crash you, I'm not a fan of this but it'll probably be fixed.Thanks for reading.

												Let me state this first: This is an HD release of a NINTENDO DS game. Don't expect the graphics to be amazing, you will see some pixels. Dementium II is one of the only (good) survival horror games on the Nintendo DS. It started out as a Silent Hill game on the DS but Konami turned it down twice. The developer went back and created their own game, which was well-received. This is the HD re-release of it.You start off in a prison after going through some brain surgery. Head trauma? You are being led back to your cell by some guards and start experiencing illusions. Before you know it you pick up a postcard and are in some hellish world. You pick up a shank and start killing Silent Hill-like monsters. That is the basic plot that you are given, which considering the DS, is not too bad.The graphics look good for a DS re-release. They put a little effort into the PC port with a lot of resolutions, v-sync, and a graphics slider. On my 970 (About a 980) Dementium II runs really well. I would expect that due to this being a DS re-release. Yes, I know I am using DS re-release a lot, but that is because it is. I don't know much about the game.Rating:5/10-AverageSurvival-Horror Fans:6/10-Above Average (The monsters are definitely creepy)Pick this game up while on sale/in a bundle or when you need a little survival-horror.

												Crashes since I started this review: 1Bugs I've run into:1. Music stops playing/doesn't play when its suppose to2. Enemies bigger than they should be? I'm pretty sure the secruity guards aren't suppose to be taller than me.If you're looking for a game with tons of settings, this is not the game for you.The settings are very minimal, and there is NO FOV slider. So you have to deal with what you got.Graphical settings range from literally, Fast - FantasticYou can't turn off any graphical settings, nor really change much.The sound is either straight from the DS version, or barely changed.The music is great, but the voices are really bad. (EDIT: In cutscenes the voice acting is fine)The graphics are what to be expected from a DS uport, not great, but good enough, and it deosn't hurt the eyes, nor is it a crime.I actually need to congraulate the team on using some pretty high res textures it looks good.The human animations are very, very stiff.Another thing to note is that according to Windows Task Manager, we are playing the Beta version of this.Transition from CG to gameplay is done pretty poorly.Game controls okay, feels stiff and the crouching and walking to creep around corners thing feels werid. DEVELOPER SUGGESTION: Make it so we can press Q/E to look around corners instead of this weird I need to♥♥♥♥♥♥lets waddle in odd directions thing.Pressing right click to pick up and open things is one of the weirdest pick up buttons I've seen. Luckily you can change the keyboard inputs.So far I really like the atmosphere and the story actually isn't to shabby.Unfortunatley, even though I was excited for this, I just can't recommend buying this game.

												This one I saw Markiplier play and well.....ok I didnt see his video, but I saw the add so...I bought it...and...in terms of graphics....thier a bit horrible like normal indie with a combonation of Cry Of Fear and Afraid of Monsters in it. I dont like the over all quality it gives to players as their person goes thru this horrid asylum morphing back from the world of insanity to the normal world then the insane world breaking thru. Plus the cutscenes were laggy and too realistic, it did not match the actual gameplay itself, was really dissapointed in that :/ But if you guys want to spend the money on it, go ahed, tho I assume Demtium 1 was far more stupid and irelevant.

												A decent game for the price, and a well made port. Gameplay wise it is very fun, it's a solid action-horror game with some puzzle elements. The story is somewhat confusing to me, likely because I have never played the first one or maybe the story gets explained throughout the game, I'll have to beat it to find out. A lot of the elements of this game are homages to Silent hill, such as when your character switches from the ""real"" world to the imaginary one filled with blood and monsters. The enemies are all mostly unique, and the boss battles can be challenging. Overall I'd say its a very fun game and a decent port.			"

												I recently purchased this game and it was an utter waste of money... The developers, as well as Steam, should be very ashamed for marketing such a useless piece of garbage. The game constantly freezes, the frame rate is terrible, and every time I start it up it opens in a small window, which forces me to change resolution settings. I would not recommend this game to anyone and if I had purchased this as a retail version I would have demanded a refund, but I feel so scammed that I wish I had a physical copy of it so that I could burn it. Making money by selling a broken product, without making an effort to correct its flaws, is often indicative of pure greed and disrespect for the customers, and as such it is of great satisfaction to me that such improper acts and motives will be dealt with by a certain universal law which dictates, among other things, that those who make money off of others in such a dishonest manner, will pay for their actions through karmic debt. Enjoy your profits while you can, as in the end you will lose all that you dishonestly  gained and then some.			"

												At its best. it reminds me of a cross between Outlast and Silent Hill 2 if it were made on a much smaller budget. This was originally a Nintendo DS game and it shows in the dated graphics and how clunky the gameplay can be, but it's definitely worth a playthrough.You constantly shift between ""reality"" and ""nightmare"", which is a nice novelty.It's not as good as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, or even the more recent Outlast, but if you like horror games and it's at a good price point, you won't regret picking it up.

They had everything to do it right, instead it came out all bad. Just bad, i can't even understand how terrible they ended up with it, all this good potential wasted.

Actually..Idk why I mentioned Manhunt lol. maybe the whole Asylum hospital place from ManHunt 2. Idk. But this game is awesome and it has a oldschool horror feel to it.

												Simply fantastically fun.  Keep in mind, it WAS a Nintendo DS game that was ported to PC with improved graphics.  Because of that it's essentially still the original DS game, but that's not a bad thing.The Sound and graphics have been greatly improved over the original version.  And it's still a fun slower paced survival-horror-shooter.  The gameplay itself is somewhat of a mix between Quake, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Metroid/Metroid Prime.Also, the game does not rely on jump scares, and instead relies on body horror, tighter spaces and the enviroment.

												Dementium II HD is a PC port of the surprisingly good DS game of the same name. If you've been playing Shadow Warrior, Rise of the Triad, or remakes of other first-person shooters, this game is certainly not on par in terms of graphical presentation. This is, however, forgivable for a low-budget remake of a DS game. It's only $15 so I wasn't surprised by it's low-budget nature and short length.The visual concepts of D II might be a little confusing at first. The humans in this game are portrayed in a realistic manner, while the monsters, being 3D reimaginings of the monsters from the DS version, are very designed very much like cartoons. They don't feel out of place, though; the humans in the actual gameplay look pretty cartoony themselves, as well as everything else in the game. This doesn't hurt the experience, nor does the rather simple combat. I do wish they made the character faster; his run speed feels more like the walking speed in most other first-person shooters.D II is a pretty average FPS and it doesn't try to hide that fact. For that reason, the game envokes a sense of nostalgia. It's not a very difficult game; I suggest playing on hard if you're confident in your abilities. The puzzles are actually fairly well thought out and the combat, while not the most engaging or fast-paced, is decent for being so slow and goofy. The fact that it works well lends to the playability of the game, even though the combat isn't as satisfying as most well-known first-person shooters. I do question some of the encounters, such as enemy gauntlets in areas where you could be out of ammo and inconsistent difficulty here and there. Sometimes you'll be having no trouble taking out enemies, carrying plenty of amunnition, and feeling confident with all the painkillers you've pocketed. Other times you might find yourself running out of ammo in somewhat dicy situations, and there are a few instances where death - even instant death - will just surprise you. Thankfully, there are plenty of save points which heal you completely, and when you die while fighting a boss, you can continue from the start of the fight as opposed to the last savepoint.I have a few other minor complaints with the game, including the lack of advanced video options and the uneven sound effect levels. The volume of the sounds that guards, monsters, and paranormal phenomena are all a bit varied, while the gunfire is about three times quieter, which can kind of emasculate the gunplay. The grunts and groans the protagonist makes are often quite humorous, especially when jumping and landing, which can cause his vocalizations to overlap.Ultimately, Dementium II HD is a relatively enjoyable game that feels neither pretentious nor incompetent. It's not the most impressive game out there, but it's fun. I'd never heard of this series before, and I'm sure this is the best way to be introduced to it. I hope to see more from this company in the future.			"

												I had actually been going back and forth for a few months to purchase the original Dementium: The Ward and Dementium II for the DS before noticing that there was going to be a PC port. I still have yet to play them, but now that I've completed the game, I'm certainly interested in buying/completing the originals, and for additional ports/sequels in the future.3.5/5 Controls: Iffy at times, but certainly not terrible by any means. The run would cut out (had it happened a handful of times, I would blame it on either my keyboard or my fingers; not the case) and walk was a bit too slow for my liking so I constantly ran. Part of this could be because I've been playing Damned too much and am used to the faster pace. A few of the doors/items wouldn't trigger with the right click unless done several times. These are easy fixes done through future patches, so I would take this worth a grain of salt once there's patches out in the future.4/5 Graphics: Very well done for a port, yet to keep the aesthetics of the original game it was decently well done. I did check out 1-2 hours of gameplay from Youtube, so I'm decently qualified to speak on it. I'm a horror fan (Doom, Alone in the Dark, Fatal Frame), but not so much of modern games. By no means am I a graphics snob, so obviously this isn't a turn-off by any means, especially since I play through all my old favorites all the time. If you do prefer high-tier graphics to use your fancy video card, go right on ahead to Outlast or other similar games. If you don't mind middle to middle-low range, you'll be comfortable with Dementium II. A minor thing I noticed from time to time was that some textures would either be misplaced (ie. above the surface it was supposed to lay on) or be removed. When gone completely, the game would lag, as if it was still trying to load them (ie. wood grain from stilted houses on ice when you were walking on the ice). It never happened anywhere where you'd be fighting, or where anything would spawn, so it's not too large of an issue. It may even be addressed in a future patch.3.5/5 Story: Decent, a bit repetitive at times, but with enough twists and puzzles to keep you going for the 4-6 hours to finish it out. Major gripe: I wish they would have did something a bit more special with the final cut scene. I understand what was going on, but it felt rushed and flat.3.5/5 Gameplay: The revolver was...strange at times, crosshairs laggy, recoil weird and clunky. Reloading was terribly annoying when guns were required (tab, click on held gun, wait for reload). I won't even talk about how annoyed I was with the shotgun. For the most part I stuck to my shank since I dislike shooters anyways. A few other glitches, but with a major patch coming either today or tomorrow, I'm going to withhold those since they'll most likely be address anyways. HINT: In doubt, just restart the game. It seems to fix itself a lot if you run into any issues.4/5 Music: From the quality I heard from the DS version to the reboot, I'm very happy with the changes. It's been said that all of the audio has been redone with this release, and it's all been for the better. I never had any issues with the audio up until the final boss fight, where it wobbled and shrieked a bit; I felt like I was in Lavender Town again. Again, most likely will be fixed with future patches, so I'm not worried about it either.3.7 Overall now, rounded to 4/5 when patches correct the most glaring issues. Most things are going to be updated with future patches, anyways, so don't let those critiques bother or drive you away from a solid overall horror experience if you like the old feel with some solid updates. Not to mention the dev's have been completely helpful, understanding, and rushing to get the game patched up as soon as possible, so no qualms whatsoever for me. Have fun and immerse yourself into the mind of the insane.			"

												I bought this game because back in the day I cannot buy the original copy due to my country not letting the game in, and I am totally impressed by it. However, it is not due to super awesome graphics or anything like that. The idea of playing it on PC itself makes me happy. A lot (if I remember correctly) of people said that it is not living up to their expectation, but really I think the one to blame here is the inability of the marketing development to decide what part of their game they want to sell. It might be received better if they sell it as a nostalgia for people who actually played it on DS first, and really the game speaks more of that. From the enemy cheesy movement, laggy and seemingly less important cutscenes, and the atmosphere (hhehehe) is pretty much what brings me to DS version captured accurately in this port. In conclusion, if you're looking for a good horror game, this might not be your first option since it is better for someone who already played this game before.			"

												It's as bad as you thought it was going to be. With this relatively new trend of porting iOS and Android games to PC's it seems that small time portable developers have tried to push their way into this. Case in point: Nintendo DS games being ported to Windows PC's. Don't assume this is going to be one of the few DS games to come to PC (there is Resident Evil Revelations after all). What you can safely think, however, is that the vast majority of these games are going to be♥♥♥♥♥♥ The reason why the DS is such a successful system is because it has a nice gimmick behind it, just like other modern Nintendo consoles. The gimmick here is that it has a touch screen that's relatively easy to use, and almost completley unheard of when the system originally came out. Due to its initial surprise at launch the system now has a dedicated fanbase that will continue to buy the system and games for it, and now that 3D is added more people are buying it. Are the games good on DS? Yes. They're very good on DS, but why would that mean that they wouldn't be good on PC? Well, that's because PC's have had mouses since forever, which basically replicates the stylus controls on a DS. Why is that bad? The problem with this is that we don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥because every game we play uses that. It's not a gimmick anymore. Another part of being able to use a mouse is that games originally on DS that had some kind of difficulty in them are way too easy on PC's because a mouse is much more accurate and easier to use than a stylus and touch screen. Simply put, most DS games ported to PC cannot do what this game did and just make a direct port with slightly better graphics. The game is too easy even on harder difficulties and the level design is also extremely archaic and simplistic. That is not a good thing for a first person shooter, especially a horror game. Resident Evil Revalations worked because it's ♥♥♥♥ing resident evil and also because the made HUGE improvements to the graphics and actually modified aspects of gameplay and control for PC in order to make it not easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now that I have that out of the way I'd like to point out that even without these flaws the game would still be total♥♥♥♥♥♥because it isn't even remotely scary and the monsters look ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious.I mean, people tell me the game was terrible on the DS, so the PC port is gonna suck even harder.3/10. Slightly more enjoyable than Bad Rats. "

												Dementium II HD is a sequel to Dementium I HD which was a prequel to Dimention III SD, neither of which actually exist.  Actually this game is a port of a Nintendo DS game from the far off year of 2006, and it's pretty friggin' good.  In this game you play as escaped convict murphy pendleton, who is trying to escape from Racoon City with his autistic son in law Josh.  Along the way you will explore such exciting locals as jail, super jail, and a maceys.  If you liked video games on the Nintendo DS, but not actually playing video games on the Nintendo DS then this game is for you.  If you instead don't like either of those things, and like circle strafing around spooky scary monsters, while you hit them with a two by four with a nail in the end, then this game is also for you.  If you enjoy long walks on the beach, fine wine and candle lit dinners, and evenings spent listening to phil collins records then...uh...you're gonna have a bad time.			"

												For those who played the original Dementium II, I can assure you that there are both pros and cons to this game.Pro                                                                                     Con1. Graphics are fair                                                             1. confusing storyline unless you played the first game       2. Great Music                                                                    2. the graphics are not crisis 3 mode, so don't expect that3. Scary atmosphere                                                          3. Very few settings, don't expect to be able to change much4. Gives you that nice nostalgic feeling 5. Original and compelling story, if you played the first Dememtium...Overall, this was a fair game, it really gave that Nostalgic rush I was hoping for.

												Dementium 2 on the DS was one of the better horror games I played.  It was extremely atmospheric, was profoundly creepy, and the villain was surprisingly intimidating.  Aside from that, it controlled great, and the gameplay was pretty solid.Fast forward to now, and the HD edition is amazing.  The graphics are ten times better, thus increasing the already chilling atmosphere, the plot is fleshed out with additional notes and areas, and the Doctor is as awesomely malevolent and creepy as ever.8/10.  Would play again.			"

												For all that it is, it's a great game, loved the DS version and it was always fun to go thru but the PC version isn't that great, it's still the same great experience but the fact they slap a HD remake on the name or call it a remake at all is disgraceful, the only good change you can see are the cutscenes and the graphics which aren't that great, the sound quality is ripped from the DS game instead of being improved, not to mention the subtitles are broken, and it's poorly optimized with limited graphical settings. All in all it's a great game to play, but the PC version isn't worth the $11 or $15 price tag, you might as well go to gamestop and get the DS version of the game for less and a better experience			"

												I've played and beaten this on the Nintendo DS, so i'm qualified to review this after playing it for a short while. Dementium 2 ""HD"" and i use that term very loosely because while the lighting and textures were clearly updated other important things were not. Animation quality, while smoothed out from it's DS counterpart, is still unchanged and looks very much like it came from a DS game. Fans of Playstation 1 horror games such as Resident Evil will get good nostalgic enjoyment out of this game, because for better AND for worse it is very much a callback to classic survival horror genre games such as Alone in the Dark, Dino Crisis, and such; bad voice acting, damage sponge enemies, safe rooms where you save, cheesiness and all.Newcomers that know nothing of this franchise will trash it hard for it's extremely primitive graphics and gameplay. And it's totally understandable if you know nothing about this game before buying it. It's because of this that I'm unsure on whether or not to leave this as a ""Yes"" recommendation or a ""No"" recommendation. I mean, this game is fantastic for a DS title, it's just not up to par with other PC releases. As I said, newcomers to this franchise will be VERY put off by the low budget looking graphics and gameplay. They should have implemented ragdoll physics and an FOV slider into the updated engine and given us more graphical settings for this to be a true ""HD"" rerelease.			"

												This game could have been decent but instead it's just a below average action horror game. Except that the game isn't scary at all and the gameplay is quite awful as well... The atmosphere of this game is pretty much anything but scary and possibly more comedic due to the very low quality models and animations that accompany them. Instead of being scared by a crazy person chained to a medical bed, you'll probably start laughing due to how ridiculous the animations are. Again, the gameplay is pretty terrible. The very beginning of the game consists of mashing down left mouse since you're stuck with a shank and you just have to kill some zombies, guards, and weird demon creatures. Eventually you get some guns but they just feel terrible and it seems difficult to aim them, or perhaps the enemies just take a crazy amount of damage even if you get headshots.There also seem to be no real options for audio, graphics, gameplay, etc. despite this being a PC game. The FOV is locked at around 80 degrees and the graphics settings is just a slider between different presets...I wouldn't recommend this game at all, even if it were on sale for 75% off. It's simply terrible as a PC game. "

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This game is a Horror action game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can play this game in Fullscreen or window mode.There are different resolution sizes. (However you can't change this during the game).You can change the graphics qualityy. (However you can't change this during the game).There is a brightness Slider bar.There is Music, Sound and Master slider bar.The game has Subtitles.The game has some different languages.You are able to change your controls and sensitivity.You can play this with a xbox controller. With Vibration.About the game.Storyline is okay.You have a mini-map at the corner.You have an inventory.Soundtrack is okay.There is somewhat a ""Combat music"" when near an enemy or you are fighting with one.Graphics are ok (imported from the nintendo version).its an easy pick-up game and you will understand it quickly. it may be bland or too easy.There is a difficulty settings.Game is short.You are only able to save at save points and nowhere else. (They will also heal you).The game doesn't have good Animations. They are a bit dull.You can't change the difficulty during the game.You are able to skip cutscenes.Other things.This game is more horrorfying then most of the horror games out there with their stupid jump scares - this game does not have it that much.There were some glitches before which forces me to do the entire game over again.The game is not scary at all. So do not be afraid to buy this.Enemies will not follow you if you proceed to a different room. Which requires loading.Difficulty only increases the HP and damage from the enemies. Not the ammount. The ammount of enemies will always be the same.Let's Try Video:

												6/10Dementium 2 HD is a PC port of a game originally released for the DS. If you compare the game to a lot of other horror games around, you'll find it to be a subpar port - the graphics are bad, voice acting is bad, the cutscenes are bad - even despite considering it's supposed to be a HD remake of the game.The game itself also has certain issues, with the biggest of them being the terrible hit detection (sometimes you'll shoot an enemy that's standing near a wall or object, but still in clear sight, and the game considers the shot to hit that wall or object) and the character sometimes gets ""stuck in nothing"" when trying to walk on uneven floor.Despite these flaws, Dementium 2 HD is still a decent game. It's a game that relies a lot more on making the player feel disturbed rather than relying on jump scares, so it's more disturbing than scary - like the original Silent Hill games (except not as good as them). Story is a bit confusing, but passable at least. The gameplay is decent despite the issues it has. Replay value is, unfortunately, very low - no alternate endings, no extra modes, no secrets, etc. I think probably the biggest letdown of the game is the challenge, as there isn't much challenge - most enemies are very easy to kill even if you lack ammo for your guns, there are a lot of health items through the game, you can get a full health refill at save points and even bosses aren't really challenging. I'd personally recommend playing at the highest difficulty so the game has some level of challenge.For the cheap price it has, I'd say it's worth it as a one-time experience. If you don't want to get it at full price, wait for a discount or try to get it in a bundle.			"

												this game has pretty bad graphics, they never should have put the HD in it, but people like myself where we dont let the graphics of a game ruin the whole game it really does not matter, i remember this game when i was a kid i was so scared of it (what do you want from me i was really young) so i was very happy to see it on steam i just wish they would come out with dementium the ward, now that was a really good game, sadly it was only for the DS, and the graphics differ from cut scene to the game, anyways moving on this game really sets off a creepy vibe it can get a pretty predictable but that does nto beet some of the creativity that they put in the game like your flash light flickers and your guy will either reset it or shake it and then it will turn back on but those couple of seconds without the room being luminous for those couple of seconds that your flash light is out you really can feel the cold chill, the creepiest moments are when you find yourself under ground or heading that way, the fighting coudl be a bit more action packed and the litle two legged red things that are small can get really hard to hit, the spread apart save points also add to a good effect because you know if you quit when you feel like it you will pay the price later by having to start from your previous save, if you are scared and you want to exit it only gets you more on edge  knowing you have to find a save before you quit, when i was down in the tunnles with the ghost that make the loud noises i wanted to quit but i did not wanna have to pay the price after, the hammer makes for a good effect to open things but thats basicaly its only use, seriously this game is worth it is a really good cheap scare and as in cheap i mean the game is a cheap game money wise but the scares can get good, it not one of those games where the scares are so bad you cant even continue, its a game where you know you can keep going but you kinda wanna quit to calm down, i have had alot of fun playing this game i definatly rate it a thumbs up now all we need is Dementium the ward HD :P oh also there is an achivment for completing the first chapter with only the knife, depending on what type of person you are it could get easy or hard, but you have to fight a boss with the knife only so i think u could handle yourself and the ghost underground, dont knife or shoot them just run the other way.

I do love the pc version though.Pros:+Fun Gameplay+Improved Graphics+Fun Bosses+Disturbing Sense+Loads of weapons+Achievements+Switching between Hell and Normal visions.+Controller Support+Good & Easy Puzzles+Notes are still here+Animations are goodCons:-Bugs-Aiming with guns is SUPER awkward-Combat is different than the DS version-In Hell mode, there's darkness in front of you, while in the PC version, that's removed-The fastest mode for graphics, it made my game lag SO BAD-The flying bugs (Enemies) follow you even if you don't have the flashlight.-Some sound effects are removed or replaced-With the controller in menus/puzzles, it's a very slow mouse cursor-Sometimes when you switch your weapon, the animations when switching lags, or just appear out of nowhere-No storyIt's still a good game, but kind of a bland port. For 5 dollars, it's worth it, but it's better to get it on a sale. Go save up for a DS version of Dementium II.7/10			"

												This game is kinda clunky to play and generally uninteresting to me. I would much rather play something else than this game.The first boss must be fought with a knife, but it's ok because it's pretty easy to do that, you don't take that much damage from the boss.The weapon play is kinda weird, the crosshair is kinda off-center and generally jiggles as you look around.Enemies are pretty boring so far.I feel like this game really misses the mark in creating a horror game that is scary to play, or even a campy horror game that is fun to play.I'd suggest games like Amnesia the Dark Descent if you're more towards the puzzle side of horror games and want to hide from monsters, Dead Space is a pretty fun third person shooter that just gives off that unsettling feeling of scary stuff popping out to kill you.

I'd personally recommend playing at the highest difficulty so the game has some level of challenge.For the cheap price it has, I'd say it's worth it as a one-time experience. If you don't want to get it at full price, wait for a discount or try to get it in a bundle.			"

												It's short, but it's pretty good for what is worth. It has that silent hill-ish vibe to it that makes it interesting, for the asking price is totally worth it.			"

												First Dementium game i tried, it's not an scary game but thats fine for me, the game is linear, not much of a challenge, i player the hardest difficulty and was able to beat the game and having a lot of meds and ammo by the end, the graphics are ok, i don't ask much for a game that was released a couple of years ago, overall its just a decent game, its not a must play and it isn't that bad either, if you want to try it get it when it is cheap!

												This is my second review on this game. I got the DS version, and that's MUCH more better than the port. I do love the pc version though.Pros:+Fun Gameplay+Improved Graphics+Fun Bosses+Disturbing Sense+Loads of weapons+Achievements+Switching between Hell and Normal visions.+Controller Support+Good & Easy Puzzles+Notes are still here+Animations are goodCons:-Bugs-Aiming with guns is SUPER awkward-Combat is different than the DS version-In Hell mode, there's darkness in front of you, while in the PC version, that's removed-The fastest mode for graphics, it made my game lag SO BAD-The flying bugs (Enemies) follow you even if you don't have the flashlight.-Some sound effects are removed or replaced-With the controller in menus/puzzles, it's a very slow mouse cursor-Sometimes when you switch your weapon, the animations when switching lags, or just appear out of nowhere-No storyIt's still a good game, but kind of a bland port. For 5 dollars, it's worth it, but it's better to get it on a sale. Go save up for a DS version of Dementium II.7/10			"

												I found this game to be very... ok, I guess. The highlight, I feel, are the monsters. They're very Amnesia meets Doom esque and the sound design, although not fantastic quality, is unique in it's own, incredibly weird way. Most of my fun with the game came from what kind of weird♥♥♥♥♥♥the was going throw at me next.  For those of you who actually care, the graphics and animation were definetly not of their time but they worn't terrible either. Once again, very ok.This could be mended if the game happened to have an intriguing story but it doesn't seem to be there much at all. Notes in game tend to give you incredibly small tidbits as to what's going on but they never seem to tie together into an overarching plot. I mainly stuck with it because I'm a huge horror fanboy and can deal with little story or bad animation for the sake of some interesting scares. But eventually stoped playing when the game seemed to crash about 1/4 of the way through the 5th chapter. OVERALL: Yes it's a pretty OK game. But for the price tag, I believe the shear amount of content alone is worth it if you're even remotely into horror games. If not, than you're probably not going to find joy in it like I did.			"

												got it really really cheap. it's nothing special. but, i will recommend it, you know why, because i miss old school survival horror games! i miss stories told through memos and tense notes, i miss old school almost monochrome inventory screens, clunky mechanics(in a survival horror)... also the game is not all that bad actually but really lacking the key word here is lacking. it's so bland and moderate, it's just not memorable at all. but hey, if it's cheap and you are a survival horror fan, don't miss it, you'll not like it really, but you will reminisce... a lot.bottom line: if you are an old school survival horror fan, give it a try if you can find it on a sale just for the old times sake.

												Although it won't be praised for its graphical fidelity - the horror and atmosphere is by far where the focus is at: rather than spending time looking at the walls worshipping its textures you'd instead be running away from the spooky guards and monsters with your butt clenched for days. Overall satisfying if you want to terrify yourself! 8.1/10			"
