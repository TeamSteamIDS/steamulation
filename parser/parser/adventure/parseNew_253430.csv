												First, allow me to tell you that I'm only going to be rating this product on solely what it is, I will not be comparing it to other products. Content in this review is subject to change when the product gets modified. If you would like to contact the developers with your opinions about this product or suggest future updates, contact them at support@digitaldnagames.com.Since its launch on Steam in February 2014 this game has been criticized for having a multitude of issues ranging from having absolutely no graphic or control settings to no communication options. Recently, this product has implemented the following:● Resolution settings. You can now change the resolution in-game!● Render distance settings. Lowest, Low, Medium, High, and Ultra.● Texture quality settings. Low, Medium and High.These settings were needed in order to call this a PC game. Now that these issues have been addressed, allow me to criticize some of the things they have recently implemented and the things they still haven't. They recently implemented a fairly large health bar at the top of the screen. I find this rather odd considering health in Castle Miner Z almost immediately regenerates. I would prefer if I could move this around or just turn it off all together. Along with a nice retexture of every block in the game, they've also added a new blue user interface.The game still lacks a variety of enemies, blocks, an antialiasing setting and a voice chat system. Also, text communication is rather limited. For example, if I wanted to say ""Hello everyone, how are you all doing?"" I would only have 5 characters left afterward. You also do not have the ability to paste characters.February 2014:Castle Miner Z's Controls Initial Release[i.imgur.com]Castle Miner Z's Graphic settings Initial Release[i.imgur.com]March 2014:Castle Miner Z's Controls in March 2014[i.imgur.com]Castle Miner Z's Graphic settings in March 2014[i.imgur.com]May 2014:Castle Miner Z's Controls in May 2014[i.imgur.com]Castle Miner Z's Graphic settings in May 2014[i.imgur.com]Unfortunately, there are still some major issues plaguing Castle Miner Z, I've listed a few below.● Save Data Deletion Upon Every Update. This is serious, what's the point in playing in the first place if everything you accomplish is refreshed after every major update?● Lack of Voice Chat Functionality. Currently the only means of communication in-game is a very limited text system.● Lack of NPC Variety. Understandably not every game has to have 30+ different models of enemies but different reskins of dragons, zombies, skeletons and Demons with the same exact sound effects just aren't enough.● Lack of Block Variety. A larger variety of things to craft with resources would have been great additions. Dirt, rock, wood, ore, Bloodstone, weapons, explosives, doors, and walls is what I would expect from an Alpha.Many of you commenting think I am hypocritical by spending over 300 hours in this game, I find this rather absurd. If anything, you should consider the time I spent on this game as thorough testing of the product. For those of you wondering, 2/3 of the time I spent playing this game went towards an achievement that requires you run the game consecutively for 100 hours. The first time I attempted this achievement the memory leakage was so horrid it immbolized my PC after the first three days. I tried it once again in windowed mode and succeeded.			"

												CastleMiner Z introduces a completely new genre to the gaming industry, in which a player is set in a randomly generated sandbox world with nothing but blocks to survive and thrive. It also has zombies. Also never done before. and Skeletons with Bows. Never seen it. You can also go to a hell-like underworld with zombies and fortresses. This is like the greatest game ever made. broke the scale, I can't even rate.			"

												CastleMiner Z.. where do I even begin? CastleMiner Z is a Voxel FPS Horror game where your only goal seems to survive or go farther from your starting point, and go progress to get higher tiers to fight the zombies with.First of all, the graphics; They are very poor and need work, and a lot of times glitch out.Secondly there's the Gameplay: The gameplay is decent, but get's very repetitive, with nothing much to do other than go farther away from spawn and try not to die. The guns are very unabalanced and need work aswell. For a survival game, suprisingly you don't have to eat or anything, you can literally just sit in a hole in a mountain or something and not get killed ever, and once you're aware of that it becomes very stale.Third of all, Optimization: This game isn't optimized very well, and has laggy FPS even on good computers. The porting from Xbox 360 to PC/Steam is poor aswell and feels like they put no effort into it. Even the Xbox 360 controller buttons are still there. It's missing basic features like a ingame chat that should be there already.Lastly, the bugs. This game has a lot of bugs, like.. a lot of bugs. How could a game be released like this? Sonic 06 all over again.  This game is okay, but needs imporvement, I wouldn't recommend it right now. I'd recommend making this a early access game if possible, it has potential, but it feels like your not using it. It's very lacking right now. 04/10 at it's current state (1.6.3.3)			"

												This game is terrible. It is a blatant minecraft ripoff, but with guns. Now, I can't go into the specifics, as it has been several months since I have played, but I recommend you just save your money and get the normal minecraft. I'm glad I got this game for free!EDIT: I recommend reading my arguments in the comments if you would like to defend Castle Miner Z, as I go over some important points. Besides this note, I have not edited my original review.			"

												Such a shame.Graphics are nice, (except for the amount of dust while mining obscuring the block you're aiming at). Nice, dark feel. A promising crafting system and potential for so much more.Unfortunately, as far a I can tell, nothing of any significance had happened since last May. It's almost as if the developers have released a half-finished project for sale and just cut and run with the money.Kickstarter projects and early release accesses require a certain element of trust. To my mind, and I'm sorry for all the honourable, hard-working, independant developers out there, this has put me off funding/supporting projects-in-development for good. "

												First off, this game needs a LOT of work. It's fun, but there's not much here. The only things that you can craft are basic building blocks from wood gathered, tools (just like the ones in Minecraft), and an assortment of guns. It's too simple! There's no need to make a crafting table in order to make better weapons, there's no form of armor, and there's no need to build a furnace to smelt the ore that you've collected during your mining adventures. I can't stress this enough. It's too simple!Secondly, the game is really hard, despite it's simplicity. Even playing on Easy mode, the zombies would kill me in just 3 hits, which is ridiculous. To make matters worse, when you die, all of the items in your inventory are gone. Poof, vanished into thin air, so even if you manage to get back to where you were killed, you can't collect any of your stuff that you had worked so hard for. Oh, and did I mention that the zombies spawn almost right next to you? Yeah, random spawn points for ALL of the enemies, based entirely on where you are. In other words, you are the spawn point for enemies. It's really unfair, especially when they take an entire clip to kill, can run at you faster than you can run yourself, and can kill you in 3 F#$KING HITS EVEN ON EASY MODE! Oh yeah, and a Dragon will come by and F#$k your s#$t up royally every couple of days...Which brings me to my next issue. The day/night cycle on this game is absurd. Days only last a few minutes at best, and the night lasts forever! I got into the game, was looking through the UI for the crafting and by the time I had understood how everything worked, it was night time and I was getting my face ripped off by a zombie. It's ludicrous how short the days are and how long the nights are. SERIOUSLY needs to be reworked.Lastly, and this is just a nitpicky thing, the sensitivity is really high, and even when you adjust it, it doesn't change anything. When you're in standard view, if you twitch in any direction, you'll practicially do a 180, but when you aim down the sight, you're lucky to get the damn thing to move. It's very unpolished. Honestly, I'd stick to Minecraft if you're looking for a sandbox crafting type game, it has way more to do, the enemies are balanced and won't continually spawn right next to you, and if you die, you can at least get your stuff back (if you manage to get back to the spot where you died fast enough)			"

												  I came into this being a fan of minecraft and an avid player of it.  This was of course made as a replacement of minecraft on the xbox but moving it over to pc is simply a mistake.   Graphics... minecraft kills it especially with texture packs, the guns... easily moddable, gameplay...boring unless trolling people in mp   You want a blocky survival game go for minecraft, a small price to pay for a much better game which is excactly the same idea.   With minecraft around, there is simply no reason for this game on pc, it is inferior in every way to the original even though all the basic mechanics are the same. Basically a clone of a far more superior game, for xbox fine but on pc we have minecraft!!			"

												no resolution settings and ambiguous error messages on 4/5 connections I attempt to make with player hosted servers. This is the first purchase I've ever made on steam that I have regretted enough to email steam's support and ask for a refund. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc game at release, should have been far more polished before it was allowed through Steam's vetting system. Seems to me like they're trying to make a quick buck and it makes me sick.Edit:As of tonight (1.5 days after emailing steam support) I have yet to receive a response.... Steam has lost me as a customer unless or until I am able to get this resolved.First I'd like to say that I purchased this game on the xbox and actually really enjoyed it but it is lacking major technical features for a full steam release title on the pc. Steam should have labeled this release as an early access title!DigitalDNA Games, for you I have just spent 30 minutes troubleshooting your game, these are my results which are the same issues I was running into yesterday. Also I tested it on two known good systems both yesterday and today and I have a reasonably good internet connection: ping 25ms, DL 165 mbps, UL 8 mbps.On both systems I occasionally experience an error where after selecting ""Play online"" I am presented with the message ""connecting... please wait..."" but the message just continues to flash and never disappears. I have waited as long as 5 minutes to no avail. I seem to run into this error about 1/5 times.When I am able to access the list of player servers I am having slightly better luck today, but still about 1/2-3/4 of the times I try to connect to one I am presented with an ambiguous error message of no use to me in troubleshooting whatever problem may exist. The text of this error is as follows:""Connection ErrorConnection failed: Host DisconnectedOk""Also if I accidently try to join a server that requires a password, the cancel button on the dialogue box allowing you to enter a password does not work. When I click it nothing happens at all. I have to select ok which takes me to the same ambiguous error message as above and then to the main menu.Now that I have gone out of my way to reinstall your game and spent about 45 minutes to an hour of my time troubleshooting for you, I would ask that you contact me directly or through steam and offer me a refund on the $8.49 that I spent yesterday on your hastily released title. 2nd edit: The steam support ticked I opened that has yet to receive a response is ticket #5897-WEYV-9696.

												You know, one of my good friends saw this game, and very strongly suggested that I buy it. Me, being a little overly trusting for my own good, immediately purchased this game.I started reading the reviews to this game, and started to get the idea that I may have made a little mistake.After playing through a bit of the Endurance game mode, I started to wonder,""What else could I have done with the $10 I spent on this game?""Hmmmmm... I could have:Saved this in my bank account. Bought about a month of Netflix.Could've even bought like, 5 Klondike bars!Then, playing some more, I thought,""You know, I think that with the $10 dollars I spent on this game, I would have RATHERED:Dropped this money somewhere on the street.Given it to a homeless person to go towards his new leg.ACTUALLY bought WinRAR.Funded a government program towards teaching 4th graders 4-Dimentional Geometry.I could have used it to feed a starving family in Africa.OH, I know; I Could have soaked a ten dollar bill in kerosene, placed it on my forehead, and LIT IT ON FIRE.I could have slit my own throat with this ten dollar bill, and found it better used.All in all, I've seen ten year olds create a more original and better made game with Crayons.Go ahead, Buy It.

												If someone's going to rip off Minecraft, it could be done a lot better than this.The addition of guns is pretty cool, along with crafting ammunition and whatnot, but that's about it for positives.The animations are poor, the enemies are faster than you and can kill you in two hits even on Easy, and so on.There's a very small window of things you can craft that aren't weapons. There's no brightness adjustment (it says brightness in the options menu but is really a bad gamma balancer) which is terrible because the game is very dark, especially since it's never anything but cloudy.All in all, I very much love the concept of this game, but it was attempted very very poorly.3/10			"

												Ahhh the memories I have from playing this game on the Xbox 360. Being a young dumb 15 year old back in 2011, I would search the Indie Game marketplace endlessly in search of finding a fun cheap game. Minecraft was all the rage at the time, so when I discovered this gem, I thought it would be a fun alternative to minecraft. The graphics were more unique and different from minecrafts, zombies and dragons to fend off (Not to mention the aliens that would be released later on), and it had GUNS. An alternative to minecraft... with guns! The map for this game was very unique, as you travel further north east south or west, you experience forests, floating islands, deserts, mountains, and much more. Not to mention a Hell world with endless amounts of zombies and devils. You can travel the map or set up a homebase or both, so this game really is adventurous! I mean sure, the graphics arent top notch, but what would you expect from a cheap indie game? The graphics really dont hurt the gameplay, unless youre running on Windows 95 or 98.  I really would reccomend this game if youre just looking for some classic arcade fun with friends or even by yourself!			"

												2/10I only played for 30 minutes, and this game already gave me cancer. There is no mouse sensitivity settings in which it desperately needs, The textures reminds me of a generic playstation 2 game. And the worst part is the only chance I had of having fun in this game blew it, I had just ran into a dragon and was trying to take it down. After about 7 or 8 minutes of battle my freaking game crashed. This game has potential, it just needs polishing, ALOT of polishing.UPDATE:For those of you who aren't smart enough to figure it out, there was no mouse sensitivity setting when I first created this review. I do applaud the effort on making this game better. However, I still find it bland and boring.			"

GoldeMan's (very) Lengthy Review of CastleMinerZ!CastleMinerZ, originally on the Xbox finally comes to the PC, but how does it hold up? Not well... if I am honest. PROS:+ For one, there is actually  a pretty interesting gameplay idea , what you do in this game is, kind of similar with Temple Run mixed with MineCraft where you gather materials to go out further and further in the tretarous land to find the Undead dragon where the world ends. The further you go out into the world the more zombies spawn and if you and all your allies fall, you are stripped of your inventory (Not your hotbar) and are sent back to the start. The best way to explain it is Temple Run meets Minecraft, which is pretty interesting, but unfortinutley like all the other mechanics in this game are pretty half baked and or not inplemented at all, but more on that later, and if I COULD play Dragon Endurance it currently sounds quite nice.+  The graphics  are pretty nice as of 1.7 as they have retextured every block and monster in the game, making it more like a fresh game than a dull uninspired clone which is what it looked of before. (And the sky looks fantastic at night)+  The music is actually nice . Yes, it does come out of nowhere but it does sound nice. (My personal favorite is the song that plays when you enter the desert!) +  A nice variety of weapons  from shotguns to lazer swords!+  The ambiance in caves is really creepy  and nice. Yes, the sounds are pretty lacking (check the cons section) but whenever I first walked into a cave and heard the dripping of water I felt like I was not welcome. Then, I heard the rattling of the skeletons and I was scared stiff!+  Game CAN be fun at times. Playing this game every once in a while is actually a fun time, sure after a while the difficulty really hurts me wanting to progress but it is fun either way! I even trying to livestream it every once in a while, and everytime my friend comes over this is a game we play!CONS: (I really hate to do this but the time has come)+  Extremley unbalanced and near impossible. What I mean by this is one zombie (which mind you dozens of them spawn) can knock you down to under half health and they are relentless with attacks, which would be cool BUT once you are near them or their body collides with your, you slow down to a crawl and you have no choice but to look around to see it hit you once and once more spawning you back and the beginning and the hours upon hours of grinding lost. Weapons are not explained well and sometimes a weapons shoots further or has better accurancy than what it should be (IE: A pistol has better aim than a RIFLE!) And while on the topic of accuracy, aiming on sights does absolutley nothing, the only thing it does is move your model to the crosshair and even then the bullets still go wherever the hell they want. Finally, once you walk not even 100 blocks from the tower at spawn a dragon will spawn, this is a HUGE problem as most players want to explore a bit more and grasp game concepts before a freaking boss is thrown at them.+  Animations are broken beyond belief:  Player animations are glitching with clipping polygons (or whatever they are) and zombies just slide along the ground when they fail to catch a player only for them to despawn for no apparent reason. Players look slightly to the left than what the model shows and aiming on sights doesn't even have a model change on Multiplayer.+ Multiplayer syncing is BROKEN: Sometimes mobs spawn and other players wont see them, but they are there client side and thus causes confusion between players and causes a waste of ammo from other players and being attacked and killed in 2 hits by an invisible mob is not fun, especially in a very lengthy non saving campaign like this. (If you are going to make a comment complaining somehow then use the word Bannana in it so I know you read the review)+  Mobs are completley broken and don't function logically: First off, no fall damage for the enemy so falling into the depths of hell is just a rash in the rear for our fellow enemies! Secondly, after not hitting a player for about 10 seconds the enemy stumbles around and just dissapears which helps to levelize the mobs in the game but it extremley wonky and doesn't feel right at all. The AI is VERY predictable, if a zombie jumps to you just move back a bit and you can catch him easily. Oh, and Skeletons can spawn in lit caves.+ VERY LITTLE VARIETY IN BLOCKS AND MOBS!  Only a mere 5 mobs exist in the game, and 3 of those 5 spawn in specific locations (Dragons are 1 per biome, Aliens are at space ships, and Demons are in hell only. And dragons should have more attacks with their different varieties. Blocks, HEH! In CastleMinerZ there are a mere 13 or so blocks in the game, making castle building tideous and boring and very very unsatifying.+  Survival has little to no point,  as the world generates in a set pattern, and what is the point of survival as most people say? ""Find a nice place to settle and survive the night"" well, it still uses the same generation as Endurance which causes you to be forced to stay in the first biome of the world. +  Endurance world generation is way too predictable,  If you made someone play Endurance twice a week apart and didnt tell them the world was randomly generated I'm pretty sure they wouldn't even notice as it always goes in the same order and with little variety in the biomes infact I can name them all here: (I also have some opinions on the current biome list)1. Plains2. Floating Islands3. Desert (More like a flat land, here and on Space Ships spawn)4. Mountains5. Snow6. Ore Lands (Just the above ground being gone and just caves exist pretty terrible)7. Hell (You can get to hell in the first 5 minutes by digging down 40-50 blocks which is TINY for a cave system to change into a whole new world)+  Mining is boring!  With a little over 4 ore types it sufferes even when the word ""Miner"" is in the name! It feels like a chore every time with and just makes me want to quit the game early just becuase there is no variety in the below.+  Sounds and Music Placement,  while admittedly the music is pretty nice, it comes out of nowhere and doesn't have a point, maybe if it played after you killed a dragon it'd be a nice reward. The sounds are TERRIBLE with very low quality sounds and some really obveous freesounds sounds (My friend pointed most of the royality free sounds (findsounds/freesounds) which is rediculous and just don't sound nice at all, with the constant wind blowing and the really terrible zombie sounds and the annoying clacking of the skeletons which could be scary but the poor audio direction along with the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor sound engine doesn't help at all.CONCLUSION: Overall CastleMinerZ is a poor Minecraft inspired game that has little variety a POOR difficulty curve spanning from easy to balls-to-the-wall-hard in 5 mintues and awful sound direction really hurt what could otherwise be a unique block game. Maybe soon they will fix everything, but at the time it is not recomended in the slightest.			"

												It's fun to play with FRIENDS. and ONLY with FRIENDS.I guarentee you'll spend 2+ hours laughing non-stop at the broken, crappy animations.Then after you're done doing that, you'll play seriously. And die.And die.And die.And die.Until you get lucky, find diamonds and get a good gun.Then you'll start getting as far away from spawn as possible.Following the compass, you hope you find the end soon.at only 100 blocks.You 1 shot everything, feeling like God. Then you get 2 shot by a single zombie who runs up behind you.You rage quit.Your friends beg you to come back.So you do,and you get OPrunget 10k blocked.Realise you are nowhere near the end.Push on.at 100k you are getting tired.At 200k you almost give up.at 500k, you're dead.And you restart the loop.To only infinitely play the game.OverandOver.So, I wrote that in 1.7But now, they're updating the game.Welcome to less-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t land! Where you can finally create respawn points so you don't have to spend an hour walking in the same direction just to get back to your friend! You can also craft grenades that do some land-clearing ahead. Would play 10/10			"

""Zombies, skeletons and dragons. Craftup your weapons fast to survive the night"" CastleminerZ is an Minecraft inspired crafting game with some FPS elements. Before it was very successful on the XBOX and just came out late for PC and Steam .The good points are:  Interesting worlds and bioms (especially the alien motherships)  Exciting travel to hellworld  Beautiful Soundtrack  Stable MP It's really helpful to play this game with some friends and support each other against dragons & monsters. Each biom contains its own dragon which throws fireballs on you. If somebody dies he will respawn next to the others again.Unfortunately there are some negative points, too:  Low variety of enemies with also really bad animations  Partly poor textures on blocks  Pointless game modes (Endurance is Survival and wth is Survival then?)  Practically no more support from the devs for the PC version. Just XBOX gets it's yearly update ... (also they have their new project: Savage Lands) I highly enjoyed playing this game for hours with a friend. But the missing support was quite annoying.			"

												This game is purely soleless (or however the heck you spell it). When this came out on Steam, Minecraft had already been out for some years, and has been heavily updated and can be heavily modded, while this game has a severe lack of content (which is a terrible flaw for this type of game), very minor updates and cannot be modded. On top of that, this game costed $0.99 on Xbox 360 before it was discontinued, so why the heck do I have to pay $4.99 for it now, especially considering this game is a sad PC port. Plus, the co-op mode has no in-game chat system whatsoever.Minecraft's Main Focus (in my opinion):Mining and crafting is the main point, and once you become an unstoppable warlord or whatever with all the best swords, armor, enchantments, etc., there are countless things you can still do afterwards. (someone was actually able to make a fully functionable computer with a crap ton of redstone)CastleMinerZ's Main Focus (in my opinion):This Minecraft clone has a heavy emphasis on survival, but there's like only 5 different enemies or something like that, and once you've got the best guns and a crap ton of ammo, you're done! There's no point to keep playing because there's nothing else entertaining to do afterwards.The Verdict:At Its Best: Crap (seriously, this game is that bad)At Its Worst: Garbage			"

												A lot of fun, but easily misunderstood. The point of this game (Could be better advertised) is to get as far from where you start as possible. The world and the enemies change and get harder the further you go. Think of it as an arcade game, albeit with a lot of freedom and strategy and some nice multiplayer dynamics. To avoid confusion. It's not Minecraft. If you're looking for a Minecraft experience you will be somewhat disapointed. If you try to play it as though it's Minecraft you will be somewhat disapointed.

												This seriously is a mod for Minecraft that adds guns and different textures and animations.Diamonds are so easy to find it's actually funny, and even the best resource, bloodstone, is super-easy to obtain.In the aspect of building, this game has next to no blocks and the best thing you can make is some blocky, symmetrical castle that gets instantly destroyed by dragons that spawn every femtosecond.The enemies take a lot to kill, run faster than you, and kill you in 2 hits on the easiest difficulty. It gives the option to teleport to the surface, to another player, or to spawn. This is an awful idea since it takes the factor of exploration plus finding your way back away. Most of the fun in Minecraft was getting lost in a huge cave and spending an hour finding your way back out. In this game, it's as simple as going to the menu and clicking ""Teleport""For the money it costed to buy this game, (Luckily I was gifted it...) save it and go buy Terraria or Minecraft. Same games, only better than this.			"

												Edit: I intended to play since the latest updates, but have not had the willpower to really solo it. At the time of my review the developer had moved over to working on the game Savage Lands.It feels like ages since I purchased this on Xbox. I had built a road with my friends to the end of the world and generally enjoyed the gameplay.Now it is on PC and it is almost exactly the same as it was on the 360 (with a few upgrades from patches I had missed).Pros:+Fun in multiplayer+Decent gameplay mechanics+CheapCons:-Graphics are decent for what it is, but not great. Block textures look better than minecraft, but the monsters look like they belong to the era of N64-Playing alone is boring-Occasional bugs-The game is dead. The developer came back to post something along the lines of ""We won't abandon you"", then went silent to this community while they work on The Savage Lands. If you buy this, never expect an update.Over all, it isn't a terrible game. It was made the way it is for reasons, and it could in theory continue to evolve and get better since the move to PC, but it seems dead now. As the game it is, it works fine (for me at least) with the only drawback for me being that only one of my friends has it.			"

												Rating 52/100Recommendation - Where countless games have gone before, now with adequatulence.Don't spend more than - A bone or two.Everyone and their dog knows what game this is trying to copy. You could show someone a screenshot OR read them the name OR explain the concept, and you wouldn't even be able to finish before they said ""Minecraft."" This is a shameless, shallow, cash-grab copy of what used to be a unique game. You know what, though? I still had fun with it. It could be because I only played it a dozen hours or so. It could be because I got it in a $4 bundle deal along with 9 other games. It could be because I played almost the entire time co-oping with a friend. Or it could even be that the concept of Minecraft is so addictively fun that even the cheapest knockoffs still are enjoyable.Whatever the reason, I enjoyed my little slice of time in this world. There's really nothing else I can say than that. There are the same set of Minecraft tools (pick, shovel, axe, sword, etc.), and the same set of Minecraft ores (bronze, silver, gold, diamond, etc.). The enemies are different (and VASTLY more annoying), you can craft a whole slew of guns (from pistols to laser sniper rifles and alien AKs), and the game has a slightly more survival-based attitude to it. That could be an intentional design choice from the ground up, or it could just be that they only put in a small number of building supplies and chose to add difficulty as padding. Who knows.If you already own Minecraft, don't buy this. It is SO similar (and inferior) in almost every way that you will just be wasting money. Surely there are even Minecraft mods that add guns and running zombies.If you do not own Minecraft, are intrigued by the concept, and this game is on sale for cheap (I'm talking CHEAP), then go ahead and grab it. The multiplayer was stable, the controls are responsive, and it has the same addictive just-one-more-block-so-I-can-add-to-my-castle quality of Minecraft.I can't see myself ever going back to it though.

												Okay, look, a blocky game with lower res, guns, zombies and dragons. Many are quick to judge on something they play for 5 minutes, then write a bandwagon review to fit in. Cute.My play time isnt the highest, but I never played it on here originally, I played on the 360 first, saw it had a more devoted PC port, then switched to it.It's a SURVIVAL game, people complain about it not having a point. They say it's a Minecraft clone, but Minecraft is just as pointless, good job. The point is to not die. There.If you know how to play the game, you can get laser weapons in like 6 mins tops. If you cant find a server, play solo! It's not that hard to play alone.If you recieved it for free, lucky you! You get a free five minutes to play then complain in reviews!I've enjoyed this game thoroughly, it's been fun to play with my friend, and fun to play alone. I appreciate the time the devs take to respond and pace their updates. I like the non-toxic playerbase. I like the direction this game could go if people would stop tying it down to try and kill it. I like the game.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The only bad things I have about this game are:The balancing of early zombies/skellies/dragons.The fact that at about 25k blocks out you start to just walk through blocks in a linear line away and towards the spawn.Gun models are a bit poor too, but that's not a major concern, they fulfill their functions properly.Frame rate tanks during dragon fireballs, but not enough to dstroy the gameplay.OP alien health.Teleport load times sometimes freeze on 50% for a minute or two.Zombies slowing you down, you escaping, them standing where they were before, then slapping you to death if they aren't dead yet.PvP being off but damaging other players with explosives.Laser swords having low durbility.Zombies sailing around your head while you desperately try to shoot them.Aliens spawnin every two seconds while trying to get space rock/goo.Skeleton snipers. ~Suggestions for devs:Tweak the zombie speed and jumping a bit, really hard to get a bead on anything if there's more than one of them.Another enemy class, tankier and slow, high close range dmg, medium long range dmg/faster, low dmg, actively tries to stay hidden/enemy support unit?/more boss units, including some minions.A random gen world mode would be cool, buildings already made and such, zombie apocalypse type dealy. Or just different map types.Craftable armor.More melee options than a knife/laser sword/axe. Maybe swords. Ranged melee would be cool too, like kunai or something.Different dmg types, like pshysical, fire, ice, that kind of stuff.Enemy health bars. Please. Fighting dragons is enough without having to guess its health.L A S E R   L M GCrafting different laser weapon colors exhibits some sort of effect, red, blue, green, yellow, that sort of thing, but different for each weapon class, Rifles focusing more on blatant range/dmg with additional piercing or elemental effects, SMGs focusing on status effects like slow/poison/fire/freeze, shotguns having projectile effects (Slug, Shorter range/wider spread/more pellets, field choke), Assault rifles having dmg over time and fire rate effects, pistols having supportive effects for you and other people, not necessarily those exact one, but you get my point.Gun attachments would be cool, but not necessary.Decrease energy loss when sprinting/double jumping. P L E A S E.Different player models.Water in-game.A few more biomes, maybe have the maps vary on which ones are present.Different start locations other than the generic grassy forest place.Love it or hate it, it's all down to preference I guess.I'd really appreciate the devs taking their time to read through this and responding with feedback, I've seen it a couple times. Player feedback is appreciated too.~Doge			"

												First, I think I have to explain why I love this game. I don't have all but like, under 2 hours logged but this game has a special place in my heart.Let me take you back to the year 2011. Minecraft wasn't out yet, and my xbox had a red ring of death. So, for that christmas (And my birthday, I also have my birthday on christmas). I got a new Xbox 360, I got on Xbox live, my friend Nich and my friend Ben started telling me about this game called Castle Miner Z. That's when the fun began, see... Before this we didn't have minecraft so we had to play alternatives such as Fortresscraft and total miner. Both games I had fun with, but not to the extent that I had with castle miner z. This game was hard as BALLS! You would die... And die... And die... But eventually in the timespan I mastered this ♥♥♥♥ing game. The first time me and my ""clan"" killed a dragon it scared me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but after a while I started to really master it. So for about 5 months we played this game, pretty much everyday for about 6 hours... If I logged a lot of time into this game. Eventually we built a whole ♥♥♥♥ing kingdom with a hierarchy and everything. It was insane, people building and adding on. In the hierarchy, I was somewhere at the top, with my friend Nich being the leader so we were tight. Eventually he decided to give me my own kingdom. So after a while I searched went to this strange floating island and built a guard tower, a church, a hotel, and it was amazing. Another time we went to hell and built a huge underground tunnel. It was great, we dug out holes to kill a bunch of demons. It was great.After a while, the game began to die down with the release of minecraft on the Xbox. But this game will forever be in my heart for the epic moments of victory we had. But yesterday, 5 years later I bought it on steam... It was good, the framerate was laggy, I don't really like the new inventory system, but I can look past it. I also watched TotalBiscuit's review on the game and, it cut deep. I don't have anything against totalbiscuit in general, but I don't think he understood what it was like in 2011 and 2012 playing this game, it was the best alternative to minecraft we had. The part that really cut me deepest was that part where he ripped on that one song que, maybe it was altered in this version... But the first time I heard that sound que it felt really epic. I was walking out into the world with some other people, and I crossed a desert pass. It felt really amazing.To wrap this review up, I would only reccomend it to you if you played it on the 360 in that time when you didn't have anything else to play.Back then I would have given it a solid 8.5/10.But in the end I think it deserves a solid 7.5 in my eyes.

												Remember playing this back in the day on the good ol Xbox 360. Let me tell you many MANY fun memories with friends & by myself. Even if it doesn't look the best the scary factor when you hear zombies in the distance adds to many jumpscares. The random Skyrim dragon, and Aliens makes it hilarious and good! Pros: Hours of nonstop fun          Crafting          Building          Guns          Lots of enemy's          You can go to fricken HELL xDCons: None because I grew up playing this for 100s of hours! 10/10 Will play for 100s of hours again on this fantastic PC port!

												tl;dr Dead multiplayer, lack of tutorial, odd design choices, tedious gameplay. I suppose an interesting concept and execution if it were original, or made instead as a mod for minecraft (I haven't played it, but there's got to be mods or something like this by now).I liked the ""atmosphere"" and idea behind the game, but it's not very well done. The ""combat"" is somewhat clunky, though I've played worse. There's a smoke effect when objects are hit or struck by bullets that make it damn near impossible see what you're actually doing.The concept of scavenging by day and bracing yourself for attack by night are good ideas, but I'm pretty sure that's how Minecraft works (as I said earlier, I've never played the original). Also, zombies leap incredibly far and a single strike can take away a quarter health. If you can avoid being hit for about 3 seconds, you near instantly fully regenerate health.There doesn't seem to be a set goal or anything to work towards (likely Minecraft's objectives, as well), so that left me experimenting with some game mechanics, all I was able to figure out was to move, shoot zombies on sight, and smack things with a pickaxe, allowing me to reposition the cubes I demolished with said pickaxe.I wasn't expecting a AAA experience, but the little bit I've heard and the reviews I've read lead to an underwhelming experience on this game. Maybe I'm missing the best of the game, since I couldn't find a single server (not that I was really expecting a huge, dedicated playerbase). Single player might be good to run through it a couple times, but not much more. The game doesn't really make any sense and I don't suppose it's supposed to, but why zombies and dragons?The best scenario I can imagine with this game is arming yourself to the teeth and trying to survive the night, but I haven't been able to figure out how to actually do this, as it's not worth spending the time in the game to gather the resources, craft the prerequisite items, gather more resources and craft the real items, to burn through everything in a matter of minutes.In the vast majority of cases, I would not recommend this game to anyone as better alternatives exist and the money can be spent on them, instead. If someone with a few friends all own this title, or decide to all buy it at the same time AND can figure out the best scenario above, maybe a case can be made for this title. Otherwise, steer clear.My experience was more or less ""bumble about, exhaust ammo and weapons on zombies, die.""			"

DEFINITELY NOT A MINECRAFT CLONECalling it a Minecraft clone would be an insult to Minecraft.THE GOOD STUFFEasy Start: You start off with a pickaxe, some torches, a compass, a knife, a gun, and a few bullets. Enough to get started on your adventure.Pretty Spooky: I never thought I'd soil so many diapers from hearing the rattling bones of skeletons spawning or the ambient screams of zombies appearing on the surface. Not to mention, the zombies move pretty quickly and that makes a good jumpscare. It's like trying to kill a spider.Progressive: The progression in this game isn't on par with Skyrim or anything like that, but you definitely do not end up where you started. Unless you fall into hell.Depth: There are a few things that the game doesn't tell you. For example, you can travel out to reach a ton of different biomes. In fact, the biomes slowly slope downwards into hell like a very long ramp. Just before you get to hell, though, you come across something called ""Miner's Paradise,"" a biome that contains a stupidly-large amount of ore for you to mine. Another example would be how the colors of the hostile mobs tell you how tough they are. They change color as you travel outwards. I don't know which is the strongest or weakest, but I know that green zombies can cause a problem.Before you buy this game, go over the bad stuff. If I list only good items, you'll think that this game is the best thing since sliced bread.THE NOT-SO-GOOD STUFFSlow: This game isn't optimized very well. If you have a modern PC you should have no problem with this game, though.Repetitive: What do you do when you've already gotten your bloodstone gear? Unlike Minecraft, there is no redstone to tinker with. No animals to experiment on. There's nothing that keeps you playing it once you've gotten good gear.Health/Armor: Zombies, skeletons, and everything in between can take you out rather quickly. There is no armor for you to craft and protect yourself with.Short Fun: This game isn't fun for long. You don't even have to get top-tier gear before you start playing it less and less until you've uninstalled the game. It makes for a fun game night every once in a blue moon, but anything more than that could easily feel like a chore. This game doesn't maintain interest very well.""PickAxe"": The spelling could use some work.Abandoned: You don't have to be a genius to see that development on this game is about as slow as development on Half-Life 3. It probably doesn't even exist.If I were to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a 5. I recommend the game for the amount of fun you'll have with friends for a short time along with its cheap price. Apart from that, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Ahh this game. I'm not sure what to say. I first found this game on the Xbox 360 and I fell in love with it. For my 12 year old self Minecraft with guns and more dragons was like heaven. Now i came back a few years later and find it on Steam. I bought it since it's a low price tag and I still enjoy it. Not as much as back on Xbox but it's still a good game. It isn't as much as a Minecraft rip off as it may seem to be. There is a great exploration system, multiple zombie types, aliens, space guns, and a lot of dragons. Not to mention you can fight Satan himself. Don't believe me? I think this is a good game all in all. It's still young but I feel like it has potential. it's not perfect but the developers are still working on it. So give it a try.			"

												This game DEFFINATELY needs many updates...it's like early alpha state, enemies spawn randomly and spawnrape you, health system is weird(you get hit 1-3 times and you die, recovery to full health when not hit for like 3-5 seconds), needs MANY new items to craft like windows,fences and so on... And would be nice if they would add some new NPCs like animals and that, because if they tried to create minecraft clone, at least try to make it a GOOD one! Because right now it feels like total ripoff, i even read about the creator cencorship, that they remove all negative comments. Well, this isnt a negative comment, this is just a recommendation what should be tweaked in this game to make it better.			"

												so repetitive yet... so addictive. This game is soooo fun with friends! one minute you could be mining some bloodstone when all of a sudden satan has just murdered one of your friends laughing in his deep pitched voice. Dont let my game time put you off ive played the xbox version for 100s of hours! The pc version is defiantly the definitive version at its smooth 60fps gameplay. I cant see what people have got to complain about? The games a $1? i mean common i picked it up for £0.70 the other day and bought it 4 times for me and 3 friends! Dont buy the game expecting AAA+ graphics and gameplay because that isnt in this game. its clunky, its ugly but its fun and kinda looks beautiful in its own way! id recommened to anyone!			"

												My Experience.Zombies dig through dirt and stone to eat my brains, they rise out of the ground to hunt me down.                 Skeltons come out of the deep dark carverns to rip the flesh off my bones. If your lucky they won't sneak up behind you and claw you to death, instead they'll club you to death with their own bones.  Dragons spit molten balls of flaming stone like a machinegun at me, they land and explode all around me.  One minute into the game and it scares the crap out me, I died from a skeleton ripping the flesh off my bones.Two minutes later I went underground and zombies are roaring and diging for me while skeletons are making hissing sounds all around. I hear dragons roaring in the sky even while underground the sound of fireballs landing muffeled only a little by the stone and dirt between me and the dragons.  I pile stone up all around me but they just keep coming for me.  I dig deeper but they're still coming at this point, I am crying and calling for my Mommy now.  :)  Diging even deeper I fell though the ground back into the main caveren, thankfully I could see the sun was back, I escaped to the surface.  Safe, until night comes again.The EndThe crafting system is very easy to understand, the invertory is neat and tidy to. The movement system is very fluid, also you don't have to manual jump there is an option for automatic jumping which is nice.  For a block game the graphics are very good and the sky is amazing.  The weather adds a very dark and creppy feel to the game.  The guns are very cool and look nice to.  Enemies are very frequent and challenging.Overall I totally recommend this game.			"

												I'm going to start by saying, yes, this game is fun, but only to a certain point. After 5 hours or so, I had the highest tier weaponry, and traveled out 10,000 + Blocks. That's only on singleplayer, which is one of this game's weak points. Playing 6+ more hours with my friend was enjoyable, but tedious, and at times, too easy. Enemies couldn't get close enough to our fort to damage it when we reached diamond-tier weapons. On the topic of weapons, there is no armor in this game, so you will be stuck with getting killed in 2-3 hits, if they get close enough to hit you. Also, their are maybe 5 enemy types in the game: Zombie, Skeleton, Skeletal archer, A demon, and a dragon, each with different coloration of themselves. The Demon (Which me and my friend cleverly called Satan) Spawns in the underworld, and anywhere else randomly after entering hell. This wouldn't be a problem at all, if you could kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Normally (I.E by Wiki's standard) you should be able to kill him after obtaining bloodstone weaponry (cleverly, bloodstone is only found in hell.) However, there seemed to of been a glitch which bullets, and even lazer weaponry, would pass right through him. (And the undead dragon). This may have been only in our case, nontheless, unacceptable. A mentioned earlier, that enemies rarely got close enough to us to hurt us. To dabble on that more, guns after iron tier really are just too powerful. It takes maybe two bullets from an autorifle, which has a clip size of 30, to kill zombies and skeletons. And it takes just under a clip or two to kill a dragon. To close up this rather long review, when this game goes on sale for 1 dollar (or regional amount) then this is worth the sudo 12 hours you get out of it, otherwise, avoid like the plague.			"

												It's like Minecraft got drunk in the same bar Frank Woods did. Woods gave him an idea, one based off how Wood's bosess made millions.And thus,CastleMiner Z.So this game is basically like it's predecessor CastleMiner (Did you know that was a game?) with Dragons, skeletons, and surprise surprise, Zombies.Yes, the graphics are 2007 level, and the sky almost never changes, and when it does you cant see it because your 200ft underground hiding for your life, but this game is fun even without beauty.I first played this on the Xbox (actually this game is a well done port from that.) and loved it. So I got the PC version, for two reasons. 1: The PC version has a better interface, and 2: I didnt own that Xbox.Anyway, while this game is too scary to play singleplayer (at least until you get an assualt rifle), it's a great game to play with friends, and that one guy who joins when your forgot to make it private, who you later kick and feel bad for 10 minutes.In other words: It's worth the $4 (unless it's more in the future, but still get it even then!)

												I played this game since its release on the Xbox 360. I probably have double or triple the hours dedicated on the Xbox version than the PC version.Anyways,Lets get started by the pros and consCons:-Feels really cheap at times-framedrops-Zombies can glitch through rock -Use of xbox avatars-Minecraft clone -Can be glitchy-$3.99 is still a little high compared to the xbox version (but the xbox version literally runs at 15 fps .-.)Pros:+Gotta work to get the different game modes+Very fun with friends+Can be challenging+Not a early access lets take your money scheme+Updates are refreshing to the game+Simplistic yet a depth of complexity+Constantly updated (Other words: this isnt something the developer will abandon anytime soon)+Devs are consistent and polite+A better ""minecraft clone"" ( I know I put it as negative but its a give take)+Doesnt require a beefy computer for the most partSummary:This is by no means a perfect game, but if you can look past the flaws it really is a decent game. Its a minecraft clone that isnt abandoned, this game has been running since November 2011 Its safe to say this is a commited project. I really wish the developers well in their future projects!			"

												CastleMiner Z has been around for years and started of very well. It was released on Xbox 360 and people enjoyed it for what it was. Later down the line it was put on steam a year after. More attention was given and when there is good there is always bad. People thought the game was empty so hate started spreading. The game seemed dead but after 2-3 years the devs started to carry on the potential of CMZ. Many people's faces were happy again. Including mine.Yes the game may be like minecraft but thats just because of blocks and mining. The game itself has many other things that make it unique than to call it a ripoff. Guns, different enemy types of the same species, different blocks, graphics, concept and there's more. However the multiplayer is still continued since those 2-3 years. Servers can be hosted with a few clicks and played on for as long as you want. You can have it only open to friends or for anyone. There is almost no lag at all either! The game isnt hard to run, even easier than minecraft.Overall, i think this game is amazing. Now that the developers have brought it back it put's a smile on my face. The whole concept is good and the devs do listen to their players. Content is added frequently and bugs are fixed loads. You would be stupid to call this a Minecraft Ripoff. Have fun mining!			"

												Edited: Feb 04, 2014If you are looking for bubblegum for the brain, you certainly found it.Be sure to read through a lot of the negative feedback (because it is all true at this point). The game has little to no optimization, no avatar customization, and not even the ability to map out your controls... and that sucks.This is yet another ""poor mans mincraft"" that happened to stand out from the crowd of the slapped together junk of the Xbox live indie marketplace section. It has some interesting mechanics and some degree of difficulty to keep someone entertained for usually a few hours at a time. It is in no way a ""work of art"" or ""masterpiece"" but it doesn't mean it isn't a decent time waster.Aside from the ""Special Promotion"" it got from launching, the game is $10... It's on the Xbox marketplace for $1.Edit: After playing this game for a bit, im going to have to change my stance on this. It's a game that in no means is worth more than its old $1 price tag. Spending time on this game has a way of showing you what you will play when you're truly bored out of your mind.			"

												This game is like a combination of elements from 7 Days to Die, Terraria, Minecraft, Unturned, and others. The game is still being worked on, the devs are active, and they care. This has the potential to fill the void for older audiences after the fall and cringe-takeover of Minecraft.It is by no means a copy of anything just because of it's genre, even though it is still kind of finding it, it has it's own unique identity.There is currently a bit of a lack of content, but that is being remedied as this is being typed and it is pretty good for the dirt cheap price.This is a hidden gem on Steam, maybe not the best and most valuable gem, but it is still definitely a gem that is unfarely underestimated and stereotyped. 8/10 Not enough water.

It was a really enjoyable time and even the textures are nice. I say if you are going to buy this game, do it, but encourage your friends to get it too. I played singleplayer, it was fun but with the motivation of having others playing with you the survival gets more intense. I will update this review as I go but for now I really enjoy this game.

												In all honesty this game is an 8/10, alot like minecraft but way better with the weapons, the graphics are nicer, and the enemies are something that makes you wanna use strategy against them.  This game is very well thought out I recommend this game.  Hope my review helped.			"

												This truly is the pinnacle of the gaming industry, it combines all elements of the greatest games ever, like the last of us, the witcher, dark souls, the elder scrolls and the legend of zelda to name but a few. For years we have all waited for Jesus to return as a man, but i know now, i can see clearly that this IS the second coming of Christ. I dream of the day that i die, so i can enter paradise at last, and see CastleMiner Z in all of it's  power and holiness. Amen.			"

												CastleMiner Z is an INFINITE WORLD FILLED WITH DEEP PLACES TO EXPLORE AND HORRIFYING MONASTERS TO SLAY... this the description clearly states but when I go into the game all I see is bland crap and some green goo I feel too much pithy for to bother stomping on.Something went wrong here... very, very wrong. These console indy titles just don't measure up on the real thing.			"

												Honest review, the game isent to to bad. I used to play the game on xbox, and when i saw it on Steam i was very excited. For one the community isent that good. If you join a game with pvp, you get kicked if you kill someone. If you host your own game, prepare for greifing and your crates being ramsacked. It is basicly minecraft with guns but there are better mechanics (inventory,crafting,block stacking etc.) The guns are unbalanced. The assault rifle is the only gun i can kill dragons with. But the other guns are fun to screw around with. And it's fun to shoot everything with the overpowered lazer guns.          7/10 ~ would lazer gun again			"

												I Love this game.I used to spend hours playing this game on the Xbox, even if I was stuck on v1.5.4. I am so glad it's on the computer. There is only one problem, crashes. After you play for five - ten minutes, it crashes. It would suck for endurance players because you can't go back. It makes getting dragon endurance really diffricult. Otherwise, love your game and I see so much potential for this game. :)			"

I love to play games that are complete crap, because they make me laugh. I, personally, don't agree with it's $10 price, and thought it's X-Box 360 price suited this game much better, so unless you laugh at crap and have the money to throw around, I don't think you should get it.

We learned how to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""Yay wewe speshiul""I shot my friend with an RPG 5 timesI glitched through a block and constantly saw white.We found a floating alien crater.We watched a bunch of aliens fall from the crater trying to get us.We failed at building a bridge from the ground to the crater and fell down many times.I ended up risking my life and jumping down where all the aliens were falling to build up to the crater and collect our stuff.We built a base and Satan attacked us 3 times in it.Satan and his zombie minions penetrated our ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.We killed Satan about 1 time out on the surface.We walked into hell and ended up finding Satan 5 more times and killed him.We found the Undead Dragon and slayed it while also fighting Satan.We found the surface after fighting the Undead Dragon a third time.We ended up fighting for our lives until we both ended up being slaughtered.We fricked around and started to shoot the ground with our lazer guns until we died from fall damage or falling into lava.Our starting spawn got glitched out and we could only spawn in lava from then on out.We decided to try and find a way to fix it but we never could.All the people who said it suck barely have any hours into it and also probably played it alone. Me and my friend had a lot of fun playing this game and it was totally worth it! Feel free to leave reasons why it is♥♥♥♥♥♥though.			"

												Actually, I would say this game is pretty good, for 1,99€ it makes a lot of fun for you and maybe your friends, even if the graphics isn't that nice you will probably think this is more worth than a little pouch with candy, or maybe other small things you like. Most of the time you spend on this game you will: Rage(!), laugh, get headache, have fun, rage x2 but please, give it a chance.You maybe think ""OMG!♥♥♥♥♥♥game! need to make a bad review!"" and as I said before, you need to play it a while (1-10h) to understand what you should do and how to survive, don't just throw this game in the pile-of♥♥♥♥♥♥category, give it a try!-2: The developer stopped update the game. +1: IT'S CHEAP! +1: It's a multiplayer game (singelplayer too) which gives you an opportunity play with, rage with and yell at your friends. -1: Monsters comes in big crowds and they're too powerful if you ask me, but that's what gives the challenge to survive I guess...I would give it 9/10.

												I played this game a lot back in the day on the Xbox 360 (1000+ hours i loved this game) but this port is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ I played for about 30 minutes offline on creative and got a mining laser, i tried to use it and i crash to desktop. I restarted the game and loaded up my save to find that literally everything is invisible. Thinking i broke that save i started up another one thinking ""oh no big deal i was just dicking around anyway"" but no everything was still invisible. So i reinstalled the game which for me is a big deal because i have terrible internet, so i waited about an hour for it to download while investigating this issue and apparently several other users have also had this same issue, once again no big deal i understand there are bugs so i just say i won't use a mining laser again, i start up a new world and after about 15 minutes i find a laser lmg and while gunning down zombies with it the same thing happens, crash to desktop and when i restart everything is invisible. Needless to say i am heavily considering refunding this game at the moment. Maybe if they fix bug i will rewrite this review after i put a few hours into the game but at the moment i can't give it a positive review.			"

												This is seriously the most fun I have had with friends in a while. Is it buggy? Yes. Is it abandoned? Maybe. Is it a Minecraft clone? Duh.This game can entertain you for hours with difficult enemies such as dragons, demons, and aliens, while also giving you a good laugh at the neglected qualities of the game such as the almost 8-bit zombie textures and the character models ripped straight from CS:GO. Castleminer Z is unforgiving and in Endurance mode can require hours of play and some decent background knowledge to succeed in staying alive. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys fast, easy multiplayer with inddie elements and gaming with a grain of salt (for both skepticism and frustration).10/10			"

												I know that I played this game before on Xbox and you get to play as your Avatar however in this Version on the PC you Play as a  generic Milltary Police Charater. So if you guys like minecraft, starwars or both then this game is for you.If you don't like no Cliping though the walls, bad graphics and textures or the mediorce sound & music then this game is not for you.

												Ugly unispired mess of a game, bland and boring. There is nothing to explore, horrific monsters to slay are horrificly animated, visuals are laughtable, gameplay is dull, sounds are awful, even procedural generation of terrain always end up generating almost the same terrain (for gameplay reasons I presume, still it's was bad design decision in the first place). At least it's cheap, can't argue with that. You may actually have some fun if you have unfussy friends to play it with you. I have none, thus saying 20 mins of gameplay is enough to never touch this thing again with a ten foot poleStill there is ton of better games.Also: The game got it's Mostly Positive rating because users are mocking it and making joke reviews.Also: Released with controller support then cut it out completely in favor of new UI (which is trash anyway). Definition of false advertising.			"

												I WONDER WHAT THIS GAME IS TRYING TO CASH IN ON he lied as he stared at the Minecraft clone that has dragons in it because might as well cash in on skyrim while your ripping off Minecraft.This game is literally just an amazingly poorly made ripoff of Minecraft, except now it has 12 times the edgyness as it has guns. You walk around, kill some horrible looking zombies, get attacked by a dragon with some terrible AI, then mine some minerals and make some guns, build a crappy house, die, then spend 12 hours trying to find your crappy house again. If you want to play a Minecraft style game then buy bloody Minecraft, Its like 27 Dollars, If thats too much for you too pay and you want a cheap alternative, well this isn't it, start saving up those pennies of yours and buy Minecraft. Or alternatively, sell your computer and buy yourself some bloody food.SeriouslyDon't buy thisIf you buy this you probably shouldn't be aloud financial independence. Just like me.			"

												CastleMiner Z-Amazing , i can see where there going with this there's tons to do , if your familiar with the game , otherwise it can be a strugle to have some fun but after ten mins it got quite fun .But ....Not all features work , creative is the same as the survival mode .. it doesnt work , i may be alone on this but its rather dissapointing , but for the price i payed its definetly worth the purchase i would love a skin making ability but more like mods , to create our own unique models , because in future if you just give the ability of different colouring it will not feel like the gamer is part of the gamei would love to see this in its fittest like the oh so popular xbox version the people i know will compair this to minecraft but if you see minecraft to fit your standerds then get it instead but this game is actually quite different , for a start its about mining and not the actual crafting ability , you get guns and monsters that can be classed as monsters and not tnt infused cucumber xDi would like the light house to be able to be removed from the map in options because it annoyes me ... please add more materials and ores its to bland it looks the same everywhere xD but yeah i recomend this day waister [in a good way] THERE'S LIGHTSABERS IN THIS GAME :D AND SPACE GUNS AND MORE JUST DIVE IN INTO A HUGE AMOUNT OF CAPABILITY'S i hope to see you in castleminer Z ~ Shamelesswatermelon always  "

												You may be thinking that this is just another Minecraft ripoff, but it's a good one! I actually enjoy it more than Minecraft to be honest. The reason why is because the amount of content that is actually in this game is pretty good, and pretty good for the price as well! It has tons of guns, tools, enemies, and locations. The only problems I have is that the mouse feels a tiny bit slow, there aren't character models to choose from for right now, the chat doesn't allow you that much space to chat in, and it doesn't include signs or water. Overall I think you should buy this, and if you didn't know this is actually a classic Xbox 360 game.			"

												This game is the horrible offspring of cancer and autism. If I ever wish to slowly torture myself I will turn to this game. When I play this game I feel as if my soul has been sucked out of me and then injected with the pinnicle of autism. I have seen better gameplay in a game designed on scratch and programmed by a twelve year old. This review is my final testiment, as this game has driven me of the edge with its intense game play, I am going to load this game up one last time, and have the longest and slowest epeleptic fit of all time.Good bye			"

												This game is amazing for a minecraft like mining game.This game is not intirely a minecraft clone. Yes, you can mine stuff, but the game focuses more on exploration than survival. On of the most favorite things I like about this game is that it has guns, including Alien blasters. I also like defeating the dragons as they arw fun and challenging. There is a lack in variety in enemies, instead the game has different colored versions of enemies (ie. bright greeb, red, blue varients) that just make them stronger depending on the color. There is no passive animals. You WILL DIE EASILY in this game, enemies do ridiculous amounts of damage and at most times, attack you like a machine gun. Even on easy mode, it's still kinda the same, just an extra one or two hits before dying. Also, there are glitches, which seem more common in multiplayer. The most common glitch is getting stuck in blocks, which can happen by somehow placing a block at your position or runing at a weird angle. In multiplayer they is a rare chance a chunk loading error will happen, making a whole part of the world invisable. A restart always fixes this, but is nuisance to have to restart the game. The game also takes time to start up AND if you switch to another window while it is loading the game up, therw WILL be missing assets such as invisable enemies and items, bugged out textures for items and enemies, and a few other problems. You must restart the game to fix this.  I really like the auto climb feature, as now I don't have to jump over ever ledge in terrain, which you know in voxel block auto generated games is extremely common.  Another thing I like is the stanima bar, I know ir can be annoying, but it adds to what the game is trying to emphasize: don't go out at night.  Enemies usually run at fast speeds outrunninv you, which is where sprinting comes in. I LOVE SPRINTING as it allows you to quickly travel, but here's the catch: sprinting uses stanima. Also the amount of biomes are cool, from a desert to the ore mountains, this game will keep you exploring. You can also enter hell if you mine deep enough. One thing that this game is missing is water and lava with physics. Sure there is lava, but it acts like a static block that damages you. I don't like the addition of loot blocks, they sometimes can give you OP weapons very early in the game (I'm looking at you laser shotgun). Also, in creative mode, spawn TO MUCH! Creative mode isn't what you think, it just lets you place ulmited blocks and have infinite resources. NO you can't fly AND NO you can't give yourself items in a menu like minecraft. One cool thing is that zombies can break through soft blocks like wood and dort, forcing you to build your house out of strong materials like iron blocks, stone, etc. The game works with steamworks meaning you can just invite friends over steam. Multiplayer is ok. You can't change your appearance like in the xbox 360 version; meaning that EVERYONE will look exactly the same (as police SWAT soldiers?). Unless yoy have a good connection, you are going to get lag. There are also some wolrd sycning issues in multiplayer, for instance: My friend sees a spider spawner and tells me to break it, yet I tell him I can't see it. Then later the same thing happens to him. One last thing, the items in your toolbar will stay with you at death. There are two toolbars and you can switch bstween the two.I'd say for an xbox 360 port, this is actually pretty good. Ironically, it also supports xbox 360 controllers for input.Hope this wall of text review was helpful,-John Nathaniel "

												In My Opinion this is a all round good game, its really easy to learn play and run. With this game it is a good challenge with lots to do personally i feel this game will be best enjoyed in single player mode as you cannot trust the game to support you server.Some things to improveHowever this game really needs some optimization and fixes e.g if playing with friends game will randomly disconnect/crash meaning that all your work on endurnace is gone in a matter or seconds			"

												This game is great if your looking for some fun, it's even better with friends. While the blocky design is a Minecraft clone the concept and end goal of the game is far from. basically your goal is to get as much recources as possible and survive against monsters that are deadly. The farther you go from spawn the better recources you will find. I know it looks and sounds like a copy of MC but really give this one a try. My only complaint is alot of the times attacking zombies will phase through you. That's quite a problem.			"

												To begin, CastleMiner Z is a 3D sandbox game with a block-like filled environment that features a large variety of weapons and a few items that the player can craft, as well as dragons to fight, with zombies, skeletons, and aliens to kill. It does not compare itself to Minecraft, Infiniminer, Fortresscraft, or Total Miner whatsoever and should never be considered a ""spin-off"" of any of these games.CastleMiner is a decent game from what I've experienced. Playing offline seems like a lot of fun... and it really is.However, I do have a lot of problems to mention about this game.1.  Zombies are too fast and kill too often, almost impossible to kill.  This is a common issue on CastleMiner Z. As the player encounters a zombie anywhere on the map, they will most likely start to run fast, targeting the player, and lunges at them, usually dealing 40% damage on the player when the player only has 100 health. Sometimes this is even more of a problem because the zombie has the ability to clip through the player, allowing the zombie to hit the player twice as fast and dealing more damage than expected. Zombies are just too fast when they are running at the player. It's not easy to shoot them when you got a Pistol that only has 200 Bullets when they're jumping around like nuts. Also, they are literally impossible to actually kill. I have to use up almost all of my 8 rounds to take out a single zombie, and my aim is very accurate, these zombies seem to have a lot more health than what the player actually has.2.  The game does not have that many blocks nor items to allow the player to use.  There are only a certain amount of blocks in this game. Let's say if I wanted to do pixel art in this game, the chances of me doing so would be certainly low. You cannot obtain or craft coloured blocks in this game at all, which IMO looks very dull. I should be able to go into Creative mode and know that there will be more blocks for me to use, however there isn't.""So, what blocks did you encounter in the game today, bud?"",""Grass, trees, grass, sand, grass, grass, rock, grass, dirt, and more grass.""3.  I chopped down 7 trees, none of them grow back.  I don't even realize if this is a bug or if this wasn't even bothered to be implemented to the game yet, but I figured that trees in the game do  not  grow back. This might be a stupid example, but if I wanted to craft 100 Doors, and I didn't have enough wood because all of my trees are chopped down, would they grow back? Well, from what I have seen, I don't think they do. Trees in this game are good for the first time you chop them down, but going to them the second time, they are practically useless. All you have left from these trees are leaves, and they never seem to decay at all. Oh, and you can walk through these leaves. They're not solid blocks.4.  Stamina is pointless and runs out too quickly.  I'm always playing in Survival and there is always a Stamina bar, correct? Stamina is pointless to me most of the time, but other times could be useful. It allows you to double-jump (pressing SPACE twice) and allows you to sprint (LEFT SHIFT). A problem I occassionally have with this is that Stamina runs out too quickly, though. I even timed myself to see how quick Stamina actually runs out for. After approximately  2 seconds  of sprinting, your Stamina goes from 100% to 0% instantly. Wow, how useful is that. I could  totally  run out a zombie in this game.And finally...5.  Hosts on multiplayer games, they're all idiots.  This has to be one of the worst things I have actually experienced when playing CastleMiner Z, the hosts on multiplayer servers. I might as well just not play Multiplayer at all because I feel hatred whenever I join a game. Fun fact, I joined  20  sessions in one day. I've been kicked from all of them because ALL of the hosts tell me the same thing:"" Sorry, friends only! """" Gtfo noob ""...or just kick me for no good reason. They're acting like immature people. I haven't done anything wrong to these people, and I am clueless of who they are, and they kick me from games when I did absolutely nothing wrong?Congratulations, CastleMiner Z, you haven't redeemed yourself one bit.

												Castle Miner Z. people are expecting it to be amazing, graphics, how it plays etc. not all games are top of the line and it doesn't always have to be top of the line to be fun. each game has its own feel of how it plays. and if you notice all of the dislikes on this game its from people with like no hours at all. they don't even give the game a chance. and you're probably thinking look at me, only 27 hours into the game(as of now) i have played this game so sooo many hours on xbox 360 so i decided why not play it on pc. anyways people have their own opinions, it just made me want to give a review when there are not so good reviews on a good game. Lastly for those of you still questioning the pros and cons, everything is good in this game except, the mining dust(gets annoying) and killing ""satan""(one of the biggest parts of the game) and not getting much value from the hard work killing it.

												castle miner z is a very ""expansive"" if you would kind of game. its hard to get gripped at the start but once you get in every single decision is worth it. because of multiplayer factions are possible! they work realy well with this game. i reccomend trying this game first on xbox as the price is lower (£1 to be exact). it forces you to try and imply new strategys when going into a battle, for example in endurance mode the goal is to get to hell on earth and kill the undead dragon without saving in the multiplayer it has a rule where if one person dies everyone must be reset. this is definatly a good game. the bad reviews are presumably people who couldnt find gold after iron (i admit it myself it is hard to find gold). people say this is the result of minecraft and cod having a baby thats ugly as big rigs. i have 2 ways to disproove this being a rip-off of the two, minecraft was a rip-off its self (look it up) and COD isnt the only game with guns. seriously this world is filled with dumbasses who think if a guns in a game its a rip off of cod.

												This game is fun and all, but what about mods? Still very enjoyable nonetheless. The graphics are good. The firearms are decent at the least. The bullets arc through the air, but are effective. The aliens' appearances are unique, if not amongst themselves. Every tool does exactly what it's supposed to do, though they could last a bit longer by not being damaged from every strike on whatever block, but instead being damaged from every resource mined, dug, hacked, etc. Teleporting is a very nice feature, one not many games of this genre have. I don't like being disconnected from servers, but the plus side is that I automatically get a copy of the world I was playing in, meaning I can loot everyone's stuff and grief whatever I feel has been done wrong. The ideas aren't very original, but the game makes up for it with all it's exciting features. Overall, this game is above average. Not much is wrong with it.			"

Pros of the game are: fun, addictive,spooky , great visuals solid controls, and easy inventory large bioms. cons are: the inventory crafting menu is annoying likeing to switch too easily, not much to craft, laser weapons destroy most blocks (ex. my house got destroyed by a laser shotgun) , can here water drops while under ground but no water in game just icei say it is worth the the money also i do have minecraft and castleminer Z runs a lot better and smoother the minecraft			"

												This game had great potential. You could mine, craft, build, explore, and fight zombies and dragons, but thats where the makers stopped updating the game. I mean sure, its fun for the first few hours when you have nothing and have plans to get the best weapons the game has to offer, and the best base you can possably build, but once you do that it's pretty  much go to the surface kill mobs, run out of ammo, make more ammo, and do it again. The developers abandoned this game to work on a new game which has recently been released. Upon completing that project they returned to CastleMinerZ to get new content out, but those ideas were brought to a halt when realizing the code was old and unable to be used. Recently they have been talking about a possable CastleMinerZ 2. So I would reccomend waiting to see if they decide to make that instead of wasting your money on this game.			"

												This game is fun and all, but what about mods? Still very enjoyable nonetheless. The graphics are good. The firearms are decent at the least. The bullets arc through the air, but are effective. The aliens' appearances are unique, if not amongst themselves. Every tool does exactly what it's supposed to do, though they could last a bit longer by not being damaged from every strike on whatever block, but instead being damaged from every resource mined, dug, hacked, etc. Teleporting is a very nice feature, one not many games of this genre have. I don't like being disconnected from servers, but the plus side is that I automatically get a copy of the world I was playing in, meaning I can loot everyone's stuff and grief whatever I feel has been done wrong. The ideas aren't very original, but the game makes up for it with all it's exciting features. Overall, this game is above average. Not much is wrong with it.			"

												It's a game that is a wee bit more addicting than minecraft. More logical explanations like hell being deep underground. The creative mode is more adventuring then the one in MC. Despite the zombies looks (Which are actually good) Overall the game is ASTONISHING.  Gives a more immersive survival and even a more immersive mode called endurance. And a better one called dragon endurance. Xbox version maybe better but it's now available to more users. So digitalDNA hear me as i approve your awesome game.			"

												First off i don't know if this is a problem with many but first thing i noticed is the mouse sense is ungodly high i had to set it to the lowest setting just to try and fight a zombie without turning into a ballerina and dieing.Cons - The sound effects are laughable- Graphics are ugly (dust kick up effect dear god)- Rather unbalanced gameplay monsters rip you apartPros- The controls are rather nice (outside of the hyper mouse sense)- Crafting is nice (better then what it used to be)It's hard to say alot of good things or even bad things all of the problems are presented infront of you on a silver platter i wouldnt recommend this game unless you have a few friends to play it with and to watch you so you dont get ganged by a horde of zombies.

												Very basic game, the simplicity just makes it all the more fun. Getting to grips with the game generally will only take around 30 minutes if you're not a melt.Any previous minecraft players will understand the game very quickly.Online just needs more people and it would be really good.Playing multiplayer with friends is really funny, you really do feel scared after constantly running from hordes of either zombies, skeletons, aliens or even bosses like the dragon or underlord.certainly not a bad game, i would personally encourage people to try it out.

												Its a decent dollar game. If you haven't played it on the xbox 360, I would try this out if you can pick it up for $.99 (currently 3 or 4 dollars when I wrote this review). If you have played it on 360, there a few new things that were added such as respawn beacons and teleports (permanent ones) that could amuse you.Originally, I was never going to buy this game on PC. I played extensively on 360 and even bought all the Digital DNA titles that gave perks for CMZ (basically $1 dlc) and made it around 20000 blocks or so from the start in Endurance (whatever they call the non-save mode) and didn't really want to go through the game again. Then I saw the updates and things they added recently and thought, ""Hey, they did something with this finally. Maybe they are going to keep updating regularly."" Well, I'm not sure how much dedication is going into this as they currently have their project Savage Lands to work on (going really well actually, updates monthly give or take a week). But to finish my thought, those measly updates they pushed out with a few new blocks and a couple new items were not worth my repurchase of this game. Not to mention this is a really old engine, so even if there is a major update of CMZ it will probably be a new game.There's very little replayability to this game once you beat the undead dragon (final boss) unless you help your friends through to beat him (which I did a few times). Typically the grind to getting the gear to beat the dragon then traveling out to the 4000 some distance to fight him takes 4ish hours by yourself and maybe an hour or 2 with friends. The fight can be difficult or overly easy. First time I fought the dragon, there were only bloodstone weapons in the game. I didn't succeed before one of the fireball vollies managed to kill me in my floating base. The next time I actually took the time to go out to kill the dragon in endurance mode was when the alien update was released. That time I used the Dragon Seeking Missiles to fight him and built my base on the ground out of space goo. Two missiles and I won. I went ""Oh, okay. Glad that wasn't a pain."" But any veteran of CMZ can tell you, once you fight one dragon, you've fought them all, so don't expect much.So basically the game boils down to - Grind. March. Die. March. Die. March and finally make it. Die. March back by teleporting. Kill the undead dragon and then rarely, if ever, play again. But remember, this was (and still is) an Indie game! It is well worth a dollar. $1 That's about it though. 2-20 hours of play time. "

												First off, let me warn you this is going to be a long review, so unless you want every pro and con in this game, keep reading.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROS:◦ If you know what you're doing, this game can be very fun.◦ It actually has some kind of physics like pillar needing roofs.◦ There are a lot of items. (Not always a good thing.)Ladies and gentlemen, ready yourselves for the cons...CONS:◦ The player model is terrible. Unlike the 360 edition, there is absolutley no way to change the look of your player model, so you are stuck with the gray soldier.◦ The graphics were decent enough until the update. Now it looks a bit like Skyrim.◦ The mobs attacks' need to be fixed. At times, a skeleton will rush at you holding an invisible sword.◦ There is no kind if protection like armour.◦ The animations are hilarious in a bad way. When reloading the LMG, it looks like you're just fiddling around with the top of the gun. When mining, it looks like stage one of twerking but tapping the floor with a pickaxe.◦ The particals ♥♥♥♥ing blind me. I actually blink over and over when i break blocks, like there is dust in my eyes.In conclusion, this game is pretty good. Like all games, it has its pros and cons. (It just so happened it has more cons.) But, I enjoy this game with my friends. I recommend this game.I rate 6 out of 10 raisins.			"

(Player Skin)2-) in xbox360 version (normal game) we have nude (flesh-colored) arm and its very good.3-) New guns for , pistols (maybe desert eagle, usp) , smgs (example ump) and other things.4-) Workshop (players can modify or create mods for this game)			"

												CastleMiner Z was a fun game for me and I personaly think that it was intresting and that it had so much potential of being a great game for lots of people to enjoy but there was little to do. The only real things you could do was explore, Mine for treasure, fight stuff, and build. It was a fun game for a bit but when you get a base and have lots of overpowered weapons it will get a bit boring when alone taking care of the zombies at your front gate. The multiplayer aspect was cool and I hope it improves to the point that you can play with almost 25 people. It would be more fun to play on a offical server or just a large server where you can do what you want on it.			"

												To start off I rate this game 4.75/5.This game is a really lightweight, which means you do NOT need over the top specs to easily run this game, which is a bonus because more people are able to play. In terms of gameplay it is smooth especially during relatively intensive sections (for example: when you activate a monster spawner). In terms of how easy it is to learn this game if you didn't have it on the xbox 360? I would say that on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being really hard and 10 being really easy, I'd give it a 7. If you did own this game on the xbox 360, I would give it a 9.I knocked off .25 on my rating because I'm having an issue where my game randomly crashes, but it seems that it happens when me and my friend gets seperated by 1k+ blocks (Im the one that does the traveling), it could be a RAM issue, because I have 4GB of RAM, but I doubt it is, I might need to reset this computer and set it back up. After I manage to get the crashing issue solved, I will add back that .25 rating. Overall this is a really good game that many low-spec PC's  can run with ease			"

												I would rather use a staple gun to staple a jaguar's paw to my right nut and masturbate furiously with barbed wire than play this game ever again.This game is absolute garbage.  Enemies are way to difficult and there is no way to negate their damage. Everything seems completely random.  If you get hit, you sometimes can't run. If you activate a monster spawner, you sometimes get a reward.  Enemies are also generic.  Zombies, skeletons, aliens and demons, and the demons are not killable.  Ores are very basic and everywhere.  Enemies can spawn at random at your feet, and will most likely kill you in two hits or jump around in such a sporatic manner that you cannot kill them.This is by far the worst game I have ever played.At least it has ♥♥♥♥ing controller support. Oh wait, that is utter trash as well.			"

												Edit: The game has been updated a fair bit and it's a lot more polished than it used to be. Proper resolution support and so on.______________________CastleMiner Z is a decently fun game, it's pretty good with friends. It doesn't take a long time to sort of 'finish' the game and get everything you want, you can probably do it in a day. But it's still really challenging and fun during that. You actually have to be on edge and think about getting a safe house as soon as you can when you make start because when nightfall comes the zombies are actually something to be scared of and worried about. The PvE challenge in this game is very considerable and it goes up insanely when you reach Hell.This game is by no means polished - there is a lot of kinks to work out and it isn't a very high quality game.I got it for free during a promo thing the developers were doing, but the game is cheap - it's best  to get it when it's on sale, however.Overall, it's not really a good game, but it's decent, and okay for a few hours of fun to return to every now and then.

The game needs to get a new contents from the community as the developer has updated the game and added mod support but there is no mods for this game till now. I'd like to see new contents for this game because I really get bored of it after playing it for few hours, so I hope we see new in the near future. I'll give this game 6.5/10.			"

												Realy enjoyable, There is alot to do in the game. The game is very cheap but I think that the game would be better if it was free to play allthough I know the developers were not making that much money from the game (this lead to updates taking mounths to come out). I dont understand why this game has mixed reviews I have been playing since the launch on the xbox 360 indie market place and I have had alot of fun and good times playing with my friends. I know alot of people see this as a ""minecraft clone"" witch is true in one perspective. But the thing is that minecraft is a very popular game and so people are going to make games based on the block like world we know as minecraft, Its the same as every other genre or type of game. There are horrible minecraft clones and there are ones that are allmost more fun in some ways than minecraft its self minecraft clones. This is one thats more fun than the acctual thing. Overall really fun,cheap,A really good sandbox game,Can play for a while(does not get that boring)			"

												Edit: The game has been updated a fair bit and it's a lot more polished than it used to be. Proper resolution support and so on.______________________CastleMiner Z is a decently fun game, it's pretty good with friends. It doesn't take a long time to sort of 'finish' the game and get everything you want, you can probably do it in a day. But it's still really challenging and fun during that. You actually have to be on edge and think about getting a safe house as soon as you can when you make start because when nightfall comes the zombies are actually something to be scared of and worried about. The PvE challenge in this game is very considerable and it goes up insanely when you reach Hell.This game is by no means polished - there is a lot of kinks to work out and it isn't a very high quality game.I got it for free during a promo thing the developers were doing, but the game is cheap - it's best  to get it when it's on sale, however.Overall, it's not really a good game, but it's decent, and okay for a few hours of fun to return to every now and then.

The game needs to get a new contents from the community as the developer has updated the game and added mod support but there is no mods for this game till now. I'd like to see new contents for this game because I really get bored of it after playing it for few hours, so I hope we see new in the near future. I'll give this game 6.5/10.			"

												Be prepared to go it alone as you've got a better chance of winning the lottery than finding another player who actually knows how to play the game. Castleminer Z is obviously supposed to be played with a group meaning if you decide to try to solo this (heaven forbid try that on endurance mode) you're going to die... horribly. This game needs to be balanced for single player, melee enemies sometimes hit you twice, bringing you down to next to no health, the game explains absolutly nothing to you like, zombies can break sand and dirt, dragons blow up sand and dirt and higher teir blocks depending on the type of dragon, gold weapons do more damage than iron, diamond weapons do more damage than gold (ect). However, with that said it's something I could see worth picking up if it was on sale, with the pricetag of 10 bucks (4 times what I paid for console) it's a bit tougher telling anyone to buy it.Negatives aside, pricetag aside, stupid, screaming little kids telling me to ""kil teh dargoyn""  it's a pretty neat game. You have endurance mode, presents quite a bit of a challenge though again, they need to balance it. It has a few little gadgets like the teleporter, the anti-dragon guided missile. The weapons sound... alright, I think they could have done a bit better but in an indie title sound is the first thing to go, and understandibly so.So to wrap it up... Yea, it's alright though it is a multiplayer game and the community sucks, play with a friend or risk punching a hole through your screen in frustration. Pick it up if it ever goes on sale if you're not willing to deal with the bugs.			"

												Thank you HappyDuckFace for the donationThis is possibly one of the hardest reviews I've done. There's a part of me that likes this game and there's a part of me that doesn't like this game. It is a rip off yes, but it has enough new ideas to reedeem itself of being a rip off. I'm probably cnfusing quite a few of you with this opening so I'll just get into the review.Gameplay/playabilityFor those of you that haven't figure out the clown standing in front of you hnking his nose in front of you, this game is a minecraft rip off and it doesn't exactly seem too afraid to show that. Now you might be thinking that if it's a rip off, why not get minecraft. Well, there are a few things this game has over the original game it's ripping off. The most distinctive difference that everyone notices is that this game has guns that actually function well, unlike the guns that modders have been trying to put into Minecraft for years. CastleMiner Z also has challenge, like MineCraft did, but the thing is about this is that it sort of adds into the challeneg but it also takes some of the challenge out. The basic objective of Minecraft was to survive, gathering food, cook it in a stove while stocking up on coal, keeping your health high. Your main objective in MineCraft was to reach The End, defeat the Ender Dragon. In CastleMiner Z, hunger no longer applies, which already takes away half of the challenge MineCraft had and you might be saying ""They did this so it wasn't a complete rip off"" I say ""They use the same block style of MineCraft, that's probably as obvious as an elephant trying to fit in at a mice gathering"" CastleMiner Z takes that Ender Dragon boss battle at the end of MineCraft and places different dragons throughout the world you inhabit. You might be thinking that it's great to fight tons of dragons like the ender dragon tons fo times but I beg to differ. The thing that made the Ender Dragon boss battle good in MineCraft was because you could only do that once in your playthrough and you fealt really accomplished and triumphant when you defeated this dragon and destroyed all of it's crystals. With CastleMiner Z, it takes the lazy route to combat where there's no challenge and just blaze bullets out on the dragons and even though I fealt triumphant after beting my 1st dragon, it quickly wore off as I progressed. Another thing that makes me dislike CastleMiner Z over MineCraft is its objective. MineCraft had you go all  over the place surviving, going to the nether and fighting the Ender Dragon. Now, with the basic premise of survival gone in CastleMiner Z (due to the lack of a hunger bar and regenerating helath) what does it do instead to keep the player entertained? Nothing. Without this premise, CastleMiner Z sort of feels pointless. It gives you the objective of moving North as far as you can but, it again doesn't show much challenge while throwing this weird objective at you. There are other game modes yes, but there are games that have pulled these game modes off better than CastleMiner Z did. I can easily understand why people might find these gamemodes fun but MineCraft was unique and CastleMiner Z tries to wrap up this weird deformed child of MineCraft and COD which isn't exactly a great combination, at least in my eyes. For people that enjoy this sort of concept, you will spend tons of time on this guaranteed, however if you're like me, you will get bored of this game quite quickly.Graphics/SoundThe graphics is one of my main praises towards the game. I actually found CastleMiner Z really appealing to look at. It has this great tint to the blocky...blocks to make them have this blend of realism nd make them look like they belong there. If you don't believe me, take a look at the screenshots. The sounds to this game is a mixed bag. While the sounds to everything is good, they're inconsistant. The sounds that have been used for everything, doesn't sound like they belong in one place, it's sort of like if you get unity assets and then top them off with RPG maker assets and a blend of Unreal engine assets. While the sounds are fitting to what they have been designated to, none of these sound like they should fit together.There are some really good ideas used in CastleMiner Z and underneath all of these issues I have talked about, there is definately a good game under here somewhere but I'm just not seeing it unearth yet.Pros+ Adds in new ideas to redeem it being a rip off+ Cheap+ Good graphics+ Some will enjoy the gameplayCons- Boring gameplay- Useless objectives- Little to no challenge- Inconsistant soundsFinal verdict: 5/10My Steam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews "

The developer still promises more content and has evidently been working on a rather large patch. If any update comes out that I feel makes this game fully worth your time I will update accordingly.Also, if you are still going to get this game, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FRIEND, it's practically unplayable solo.

												This game used to be a good game... Untill it got abandoned by the developers soooooooo yeah if you want a cheap, no longer living game. Then this is your game. and for only $2 as well so if you want something to do then here you go but don't expect any updates its been a year since the last update.Update of the review.So recently, this game was updated with some new features, the newest one is monster spawn blocks that spawn a bunch a enemies for rewards. Sounds kinda cool, but are basically pointless because: A. They're hard to find in normal modes. B. The loot is easily obtainable from different means like mining or even finding from an abandoned house in a random person's world. C. They're basically suicide when doing it alone and not geared up enough if you're a new player. Now there has been some good updates like a second hotbar to keep more important items in, teleporters, loot blocks and even windows. (Took them long enough for windows. XD) Although I'm going keep my orginal recommendation of this game as No, for there hasn't been an update that has blown my mind or got me hyped a lot. One thing that will change my recommendation of this game, will be something everyone has thought about: The Ability to change your character's apperance.Long Story Short: Hoping for an update that gives different ways to change your character's apperance.

												Where do I start? This game is a poor man's Minecraft and the only reason it was ever succesful is because Minecraft Xbox Edition wasn't out yet. I know that it has guns and some other unnecessary features but that doesn't make it a good game. Also the graphics are an eye sore, at least Minecraft had an art style to it and didn't look like someone's vomit. All in all the game is trash and Matthew and Tyler are fat.

												Absolutely terrible. This game in all aspects are just complete crap. There is no variety in enemies, the gunplay is horrible (and yes for whatever reason there are guns in this minecraft rip-off), no original content (meaning that most of the games elements were stolen and slightly changed to make it seem as it's own). If I were you, I would not buy this crap of a game. It doesn't deserve a spot in Steam, and the fact that it's an Xbox Live port from years before Minecraft even came to Xbox Live to achieve money with a crap rip off. Stay away from it if you don't want to waste your time. For a more in depth review of this horrible game, look for the Cynical Brit's video on youtube titled ""► WTF Is... - CastleMiner Z ?"".			"

												Don't Play This Game!No really, don't even bother playing this terrible game that somehow got its ugly face on Steam.  If you remember playing this game on Xbox 360, then this version will remind you at how lazy developers are these days not putting effort or innovation to their own game.  Absolutely no new features are added to this version, besides the fact the 360 version already has these features.  The graphics are still terrible in this day of age, the combat is abysmal, the enemies are basic as hell, and the core design of it is non existent!If the developers actually put effort to this, maybe I would replay it.  As it now, it is impossible to recommend this game in the state it is in.  If you played any Minecraft clones before, then spend your money on Terraria instead of this trash!			"

Base Gameplay	The gameplay isn't anything new nor creative, this game is just a shameless Minecraft rip off.In short - this is a downgraded Minecraft that doesn't even have water in the game.Yeah, you have guns I guess but that's where the differences end.Some blocks are renamed and retextured but still have their functions like in Minecraft and some are completely the same with a really small amount of actually new blocks.Not to mention how unwelcoming the game is towards newbies.Even on easy difficulty if a zombie catches up to you - you will die in around 2-3 seconds.On Normal difficuly it gets even harder since zombies now spawn even at day time and just 100 blocks away from spawn is the boss of the game - the dragon.For a newbie to even survive long enough to learn what he must actually do the answer is... play without enemies.But where is the fun in that? Exactly, there's no fun in that. Graphics	I will be straight to the point - Graphics look like♥♥♥♥♥♥The player model is way shorter than the actually POV of the model and that's very noticable if you play with a friend.The player model is a normal human dwarf that lives in a world made of blocks... it's doesn't really fit well together. Crafting	It's pretty much the same as Minecraft console editions, there really isn't any need for me to go that deep. Pros.	+There are times that I had fun in these games and that was with friends, don't bother playing alone since you will get bored in around 15 minutes.+Somewhat understandable crafting system. Cons.	-Sub-par gameplay that's directly ripped off from Minecraft.-Crappy graphics that look worse than Super Mario Bros. for the NES.-Really mediocre presentation in terms of menu and the font used for the different options you can select in the menu.-Really difficult to get into. (Atleast for me and my brother).-Crappy animations.  Final Verdict  6.8/10	While this isn't a good game by any means, I had some fun the first 2 hours.			"

												I really like the game it is not that bad if you like sandbox games while there is still some action. If you do not like zome undead killing action you can jus play on peaceful. However, there is still some cons this game has. such as it is always dark I would really like if there was a sun every once in a while. Also there is a performane issue i get 120Fps on this game but every 5 minutes i get a sudden frame skip which is really annoying. Another thing is that the mouse sensitivity is not ajustable for me. I try to adjust it but it does not make a diference. But the game is very fun in terms of getting resources, fighting the undead, and also makeing guns to do so. I really hope while this game is under devalopement that they will add more guns and blocks. Also I beleive you should be able to spawn items instead of look for them and then have unlimited amount of them.			"

												The action packed strategy game brings a whole new view on tactical combat to computer in such a way, we can’t quite remember how long ago our jaws had smashed to the ground.The purpose of this online game is to break through the enemy’s defences and basically lay waste to their base with the help of minions. With 5 players in both sides, each player picks a hero from the character pool. Each hero has a special style of gameplay, support to help your allies or tank to beast it out and destroy your opponents with ease.The level up and economy system is quite intriguing. Your gold slowly trickles in, but you get bonus coins if you land the last strike on an enemy hero or minion. You gain experience for every opponent that falls in your area.You can use your coins to purchase items that heal you, replenish your mana (which is used for spells), or boost your stats so you hit harder, run faster or just generally makes you become better at ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. You can even combine these items to make other items and become near unstoppable. These items can even turn the tide of the battle.One of the few negatives is that the respawn time can take a bit too long. As the game goes on, the respawn time becomes longer and when you die: you could be waiting for over two minutes before you’re brought back into the action. You can use your coins to buy yourself back into the game, if needed.Some can find the tutorial too long, and if you’re like me (an idiot): you can get impatient, quit the tutorial, and then have to do it all over again. It does give you a lot of information on how to play the game properly and get really stuck into it, but the game also allows you to coach other players or be coached by other players. This allows friends to help each other play the game and is really the best way to play and learn. When you are coaching or being coached, you also earn bonus, out of game experience which lets you level up and receive items for your heroes.This game is definitely worth trying out. The fact that you can get such an epic game for free is mind blowing. You can even play offline matches against bots (also a fun way to practice). We’ve even wanted more games to be like Dota. We can not stop recommending this game.ETC Rating: 9/11			"

												It would be incorrect to say that CastleMiner Z is entirely just plagiarism, but ‘strongly inspired’ by Minecraft would be an overly fair description.You can add life to the world by engaging in multiplayer, but servers are limited to a mere eight players.The graphics is low for PC gamers but if you’re a smart phone user u might actually find this game interesting.So,i would reccommend this for the smart phone users only. :) "

												CastleMiner Z is the greatest thing that anyone has ever put on this earth. This game is the definition of perfection, tranquility and purity. This game is the best thing that will ever happen to you in your entire pathedic lifetime. It is the holy grail of life, it is the man-made heaven. You can and would not ever be classified as a pure individual until you play this game. CastleMiner Z provides the human brain a certain form of bliss that no other source or form of existence can manifest into your soul. Game developers should give up creating their next big project that will push the gaming industry to a whole new level of innovation, they should stop the painstaking progress of even trying to create a sequel to the extremley sucessful game that sold millions of copies worldwide because this game is the unorthadox route of a new testament of life. It is the beginning of a new end. CastleMiner Z is a living rapture created by man in bloom as one most astonishing thing to ever happen to mankind. This game is absolutley perfect from top to bottom and has percisley no flaws what so ever. I literally cannot stop playing this game, because if I were to do so, my blood stream would come to an immediate stop and every single enzyme in my body would burst and fill my body with acidic gas. Even the thought of not being able to play this game, fills me with anxiety and the means to be enough reason to end my life. Anyone who says anything remotely slanderous or negitave about this game should be nailed onto a burning cross that is filled with leeches and then have their hearts and brain sacraficed to the god, Thomas Steinke and his evangelical alliance, DigitalDNA.

												This game was made to profit off of the community that liked Minecraft so much. The zombie's voices are ripped straight from Doom, so you will probably get sued by Bethesda for that, or at least I hope you do. This game is like someone tried to take Minecraft, Call of Duty, and the dragons from Skyrim into a big pile of crap and market it as ""100% original content do not steal."" This game is not very good at all.			"

												Between all the negative reviews and troll/sarcastic positive reviews, let me honestly say that I enjoyed this game. Maybe because I never played Minecraft. Maybe because I'd prefer Terraria to be 3D. Maybe Unturned just isn't the type of game for me. I don't know, and I didn't expect this game to be any good, seeing its reviews. But I installed it anyways, and I'mma keep it.Now, a word for the devs;> I didn't experience resetting of worlds with updates because mine didn't go through any (yet). But lemme say that if I do, I'll change this to a negative review and never play this again, I hate losing my progress more than anything.> Add new skins and types of zeds.> Will add more issues later, as I encounter them.

												A cheap minecraft rip-off. So this game is minecraft with guns and it sucks. The hitboxes are absolutely terrible. The graphics try to be realistic but also blocky and it doesn't do either very well. The gunplay is bad, the enemies are all the same. And you can get the best gear in the game in 2 hours. Don't get this game.3/10			"

												There are certain games that take inspirations and ideas presented in other games and use them to create new and interesting experiences that in their new form have considerable merit. And then there are games that make it appear that the developer isn't even trying or just attempting to cash in on an idea that is immensely popular at the moment. CastleMiner Z is an example of the latter.A gathering and crafting game with a focus on making guns to combat the undead in a procedurally generated voxel-based world, CastleMiner Z feels like it is trying to combine Minecraft and Day Z, but fails to properly capture the essence of either. As a zombie game, CMZ will frustrate you with unpredictable and seeminly overpowered zombies that will kill you without warning and cause you to lose your inventory. As an exploration game, CMZ will feel repetitive through it's lack of variety in enemies and otherwise barren environments. And as a creative game, CMZ horribly fails since the only thing you can build are guns, ammunition, metal blocks, doors and lights.That is not to say the game is completely bad. The graphics are pretty decent, the crafting system is very intuitive thanks to the menu interface, and it has a strong focus on guns. But if you are looking for a deep experience where you make your own progression through better gear with the creation of an architectural masterpiece on the side, you will not find it here. The game admittedly is very low priced, but as they say, you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a really good voxel-based game that allows for actual creative options and is on Steam, I would recommend Block Story instead.			"

												Piezas de la fórmula Casttleminer Z se fechan en este punto, pero el corazón y el alma de excelente Global Offensive es intemporal. Los equipos son pequeñas, las armas son letales, y rondas son cortos. Hay un adictivo calidad solo de uno más asaltos a ella, porque hay un constante deseo de hacer mejor que la última vez, para ganar una matanza satisfactoria, o para ganar de una manera nueva. Llamada de veterinarios de derechos e Battlefield se preguntará por qué no pueden correr para escapar del fuego enemigo o mirar hacia abajo las vistas del hierro para mejorar objetivo; Jugadores de Castlleminer Z se sentirán como si entraron en su casa redecorado. Ciertos rediseños mapa cogerán fans hardcore con la guardia baja, pero los cambios son para el mejor - el cuello de botella en el paso subterráneo de_dust, por ejemplo, tiene una nueva ruta de escape.Incluso en la cara de la evolución género, Castlleminer Z no le importa que adaptarse. Miner Z es tan dedicado a los ideales de envejecimiento de Castlleminer Z pesar de mercado y cambios de tendencia que bruta fuerzas de su camino al éxito. Parte de lo que lo convierte en un juego competitivo como atractivo es que matar en Global Offensive requiere un conjunto de habilidades totalmente diferente a los otros tiradores. Todo el mundo se limita a lo que tienen y se puede ver, con poco margen para la modificación de carácter o ventajas sobre la marcha. Correr y disparar es un estilo de juego inútil, incluso si usted ha comprado un casco y kevlar esa ronda, hasta el punto de que alguien de pie todavía es más probable que anotar la matanza. Caminar, agachado o de pie son sus mejores apuestas para reducir el spray inexacta de fuego de ametralladora			"

												I don't really do these very often, but I felt this one was kind of a must.To make a relatively long story shorter: I saw that a moderator (and friend) from my community was playing this game (and knowing what this game was), so I asked him why he owned it. He said it was cheap and that it was multiplayer.Suddenly, I had an idea. Let's stream this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.I originally went to look for it, hoping it would be as cheap as it was for him (he paid like a cent I believe), but sadly it was marked back up to $4.00 USD. Given that I didn't have $4.00 USD at the time on steam, I asked some members of my community if they'd buy it for me so I could stream it with my friend. My request was quickly accepted and I was bought this game with a lovely message that I'll leave out of this review because of Steam's rules and guidelines.After about 10 minutes on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet, I had this tiny game installed. Under the assumption that we would have a short bit of autistic fun, we set out on our little adventure.Our stream lasted about 3 hours or so in total and we actually ended up enjoying the hell out of it, if not only for the fact that it is super basic and that you don't have to think about it at all.Pros:- Super simple.- Hilariously over simplified crafting.- Hilarious death animations.- Hours of stupid fun with friends.- Pretty easy gameplay mixed with random occurances of moderately difficult combat (depending where you are and how far you are into your world).- Skeletons- Runs on literally anything.- Hilarious animations in general.- You can avoid almost all fall damage by jumping before you hit the ground.- No stress involved.- Dirt cheap.- Probably a few more but this is all I can think of right now.Cons:- Awful graphics (Almost a pro for us, simply for hilarity).- Really basic and repetitive gameplay. (Also almost a pro because you don't have to worry about♥♥♥♥♥♥)- Very few enemies, just mild reskins of each.- Very few weapons, sometimes not even reskinned.- Glitchy at times. (I've had some issues crafting.)- Is no longer like, a cent.- Stamina system is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.- Damage system has gone full retard.- A few more but nothing major that I can think of.Over all, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game but can quickly devolve into mindnumbing fun with friends (and trust me, you do need friends).Rating: 6.5 / 7 out of 10.

(they walk straight ahead you, and kill you almost instantly)The game is bad at when it comes to survival and bad when it comes to just shoot enemies for fun.Also the quality is poorly, i actually could life with it wouldn't be the animations of guns that crappy.and lets dont forget dragons that destroy all your stuff, survival and building..... my a*s (yes there is a mode for free build without enemies)			"

												This game is super glitchy, a dragon came on the first night and zombies were constantly spawning. My knife and all my bullets and my pickaxe ran out in the first 10 minutes becuase i was fighting zombies. Sometimes if you punch a zombie to death it will disapear to everyone except for the person it's fighting, it will then kill the person he was fighting and is invincible.Building a base is useless as dragons destroy it by flying over it and zombies spawn inside of it. Good stuff- an uninstall button. it's this great thing that removes the game from my life! i loved it! 10/10 for uninstall button -10/1000 for game. I got this game as a gift and i still regret it.

Creative mode is pretty bad, I mean, why would you need to make things, even though it says INFINITE RESOURCES in the description of creative.Overall, it is a really fun game, I recommed it to anybody in the mood for a challenging sandbox game that has great graphics, multiplayer, and singleplayer.

												Really grindy game , i'd only recomend this if you have some friends to play with and you like games like minecraft.It will take a long time to get those fancy weapons but as long as your playing with at least 3 friends it's a lot of fun !  Some things coould be better in game , but this only costs 2 dollars ;)			"

												This game is hilariously bad. From terrible graphics to aweful mechanics to a bug-infested enviroment, this game is a travesty. This said, being hilariously bad, it is absolutely hilarious. It is a game that you and some friends can sit down and play for 5 hours and then never play again. The game is braindead easy, as you can bypass all conventional methods of mining by entering the Hell zone immediately and killing low health mobs for virtually unlimited resources. Also, if you back into a wall, you pass into it. You can do this to literally get absurd distances with no effort. The zombies jump incredible distances and will almost always end up behind you. To boot, they make you extremely slow when they touch you. Likelyhood is they give you cancer. 3/10, wouldn't play it again.			"

												xX_Susan_Boyle_Xx does not approve of this game. I found this game to be extremely easy, as i was able to kill a dragon after 5,082,984 shots from a normal pistol. I set the world record time of beating the game with a total of 77 centuries, 7 decades, 2 years, 41 weeks, 2 days, 3 hours, 42 minutes, 21 seconds and 823 miliseconds. I would appreciate it if aliens did not drop diamonds, but instead dropped an egg that would spawn a devil that would make it more of a challenge. As you can tell, I would definentally not rate this 8/8. If this game was improved, I would hapily help with the soundtrack of the game. As how famous I am, you surely know im the best singer of 2014.			"

												Okay at first I though this was going to be a fun little shooter/minecraft game... I quickly found out it's way to easy to play after you get your first real gun. was fun for a bit... I would play more of this IF they were to ever update again it seems like there is so much content that's missing though honestly i think they just released it and said screw it and ran off with all that money. This is a dead game, do not buy it they have not and will not update this game again... pretty sure of that after over a year of no updates or information just don't buy it.			"

The game was very fun on xbox alone or with friends but on pc its kinda only fun if you mp with people since I find it boring playing alone and theres no fun in that. The fact that this game has zombies, aliens, skeletons, and high quality weapon models it's pretty good. Now go pick this game up and game on with your friends and kill some ugly zombies!			"

I have a Lenovo Windows 8 64-bit laptop so this shouldn't happen constantly with this low quality type game.

												As you can see, a lot of the reviews are complaining about the similarities to Minecraft, i.e; crafting, survival, zombies, etc. However there are many games like Minecraft nowadays. Minecraft is no longer the only ""block building"" game in town. With so many different games out there like Blockland, FortressCraft, Guncraft, and CastleMiner Z - it's easy for people to complain that each new iteration in the genre is a ""shameless cash grab"". CastleMiner Z might fall under that classification, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fun game. I have put a couple hours into this game and have had a good time. I would recommend it, especially since it is such a cheap game. It's not like you have much to lose.			"

												its actually fun. a lot of people dont like it for being all buggy and a minecraft ripoff but. its only $3 - $5. (Canadian/US) and it has better graphics then minecraft and i personally think its a little more fun. why? because minecraft and castleminerZ both do repeat themselves and just make you build and get better material. but castleminerZ Is actually hard. in minecraft it would be so easy just to defeat the enderdragon. while to defeat this dragon you need accuracy and good weapons. it also has more health making it hard and when you finally beat the dragon. you have that feeling inside. that good feeling! \7.6/10			"

												For a game developed by mostly just 3 guys, it was pretty fun. I expected the people there to develop it for PC but that was back in 2012. now this game has gotten such bad reviews, and I tell ya, they didn't convert ANYTHING to the PC format, they just gave the XBLA version a tweak so it'd work on PC...Anyway if you can get past the not being able to edit the controls/graphic, or even resolution, (which is really hard to look beyond) you'll see that the game is OK for it's genre.

												I don't know why this game recieves so much criticism; sure, the graphics look like they're straight out of 2007, and maybe the sound effects aren't the greatest either, but there is so much fun to be found in this game.There are several weapons and other tools the player can craft within this game, some including lazer weapons, lightsabers, light machine guns and everything in-between. Each weapon has many different ""classes"", each using different ammunition types. The better ""class"" your weapon is, the more damage it does; trust me, you're going to need the higher tier weapons.The crafting is pretty self-explanatory as the game tells you what you can and can't craft, and shows you the materials for what you want to craft.The gameplay itself is actually pretty fun; depending on your difficulty level, zombies will spawn at different times (on easy they spawn only at night, but anything higher they spawn pretty much every time.) Nevertheless, zombies will try and kill you no matter what is standing in their way. You think a dirt house will be sufficient enough to protect you? Nope. They will break the blocks surrounding your house and begin swarming inside of it. Not to mention, these mobs will literally spawn randomly from the ground, sometimes scaring you if you're caught off guard. Dragons are also a huge part of this game. Every time you venture out far enough, a dragon will spawn and, depending on its color, it will have a certain amount of health points and a certain amount of loot for killing it. Overall, they're not too hard to kill if you have at least gold weapons, but otherwise, they will destroy your precious creations and annoy the living hell out of you. There are also tons of ""Loot Boxes"" around the map that contain a lot of great loot; if you're not much of the mining type, just go after those and you'll get enough good materials to help you survive the game.Overall, I'd give this game an easy 7 out of 10. Sure, they game is a little bit outdated looking and maybe it has a few glitches, but I find it a bit better than its Minecraft counterpart. It's only $3.99 at the time of writing this review, and I really think it's worth picking it up. Whether you plan to play alone or with friends, I'd say it's worth the buy.			"

Aside from that, there's no real point to the game but building weapons to protect yourself from the massive amount of very fast zombies, not to mention the dragon.			"

												So I bought CastleMinerZ in the early 2014s thinking ""Hey I have played this game on xbox and it was fun so I should get it on the computer."" I played for 1 hour and after that hour got up and deleted it off my desktop and walked away. One day I was bored and redownloaded this game and decided to give this game 1 hour to prove it's worth of 5 dollars. I sat down watched it download and pressed play. Lets just start off by saying I play CSGO, in CSGO I have my sensitivity at around 1.30-1.40. This game dosen't let you change your sensitivity at all. I'm basicly walking around while my mouse goes zooming around my screen at the slightest of movement. Don't even get me started on the nasty sounds or the hardcore amounts of damage you take along with the insane HP regen. The game is basicly a damn port from the xbox but somehow is WORSE than the xbox version. To conclude instead of giving this game 1 hour of my time I gave it 5 minutes and clicked EXIT. I guess for 5 dollars you can't go wrong but still its a waste.			"

												I extremely recommend this game to people who enjoyed minecraft, or any zombie game, or building game. It takes an interesting mind to combine zombies, dragons, demons, and building things like minecraft!I have found this game fun on its own, but its even more fun with a friend or too. so if you really want to enjoy it, make sure a friend picks it up too.*EDIT I need to mention, they changed the way the game's UI, I mean they overhauled it so much, and its strange and they removed host opitions, and if its there, then it is so far impossible to access.Only reccomend this if you have played the Xbox 360 verison and really want to play this game, it is better with friends, still. Not really.			"

If you desperately need to know how bad it is for yourself, you can just get it for free through totally safe and legal methods that for sure do not involve using things like a pirates bay.Wait, don't even do that. F**k this game.			"

												The concept of this game is brilliant. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the execution.Sound design, quality, physics, enemies - just about anything that makes or breaks a game, you can bet your bottom dollar that this game messed it up!Half the time, all of the blocks in the world are entirely transparent! In fact, this game is so bad that it's not even worth going through all the problems with it, please, for your own sake - stay well away from this game.This game is the definition of a bad Minecraft clone.Seriously, steer clear of this game.

												This is just a terrible console port of-at BEST- an average game,I have played a fair amount of the Xbox 360 version and that was better than this. At least your character on the Xbox version had customization options, in this all you get is a bony(whatever, I probally misspelled it) anorexic... um, thing? The sensitivity with ironsights is LOW, you have to aim straight at what you shoot. The zombie ""moans"" are more like-this is just an attempt to text the sound- RRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUU and just annoyingly loud, your attacks feel like they never hit due to NO BLOOD to indicate you hit it-if you don't use blood, use a hit-marker on the HUD.TL;DR Terrible port of an average game.

												It's a very casual version of minecraft, but dark. After a few in-game days, s#$% gets apocalyptic as hell. It's minecraft with guns, with way less of the complexity of minecraft. The enemies in the game are pretty legit. Running and hiding from them is a struggle. It's not the type of game that you play survival for eons and continue to ""civilize"" the world. You spawn, with a gun, and it's clear to see that there's gunna be zombies and other AI chasing you. You can harvest gold and diamonds and more, use minable materials to make batter tools/guns, and build whatever your little heart desires with different types of blocks. But the game's basically a very casual version of minecraft with guns and apocalypse.Guns + Minecraft+ Apocalypse - Stupid s$%# from Mincecraft = CastleMiner Z			"

												here is my reviewpros: multiplayer.dragons.lazer weapons,teleportation to players or to surface without a coordinate, regen health and no food so easy thats itcons: graphics are HORRIBLE, weapons break way to fast its stupid,the textures are not cool like look up a video to see what i mean the dragon and the zombies and skeletons are like stupid and look so friendly like WTF and sometimes the game buggs out and you can go through the INVISIBLE door. if i'm asked i'll make a video on youtube to review this game!!! so basically a 6/10 it is a indie what you expect tho!

												Worth 5 bucks? Sure. My friends and I had this game before it was released on Steam and we liked it a lot because it was cool in it's own way. To enjoy this you MUST have friends; you will die a terrible death and never play again if you don't.  We really enjoyed it despite the graphics.			"

												This game is $5.00. The last update for it was May 2014 (nearly a year ago). It's safe to assume that we won't be seeing much more of a change from the developers in this one. Kind of serves as a watered down version of Minecraft and uses many of the same mechanics. If you are bored of Minecraft and have five dollars in spare change, give it a shot. You'll get about that much fun out of it. For what it's worth, I enjoyed my time.			"

												So, to start off,This won't be a pros and cons review, just a recommendation. Please read on to see what I mean. I only recommend this game because of it's nearly unlimited fun it contains when playing with a group of friends (At least 2-4 other people). This isn't a game I would play alone because there isn't too much to do; once you get to laser weapons and such you're pretty much done. But with friends, you tend to ignore all the cons of this unpolished indie adventure game so to speak and just enjoy exploring and slaying enemies/dragons with your friends, making the experience much more enjoyable.      Not to mention, you can get this game on the castle miner site for FREE. The only reason I see to purchase this via steam is to game with friends. To conclude, don't buy this game unless you have friends that are down for it. Besides all that, great game in my opinion, could use lots more work and updates but sadly the owners abandoned the game. Had great potentialR.I.P Castle-Miner Z 8/8 would get chased by Satan again for another $2 "

												When I look at this game, I think the meeting for the concept of the game went down like this: ""HEY BOB, THE KIDS SEEM TO BE INTO THIS...UH...MINECRAFT THING, IT ISN'T ON CONSOLES YET."" ""THEN HOW ABOUT WE MAKEA CHEAP KNOCKOFF OF IT FOR CONSOLES, TIM?"" ""OR BETTER YET,BOB, RIGHT BEFORE IT RELEASES ON CONSOLES?!"" ""GREAT IDEA TIM! YOU'VE EARNED A PROMOTION""So...after that, heres my opinion.Castleminer Z was a originally a console game, before being ported to PC. I have played it on consoles, and it hasn't changed much between ports.It was apparently released the same time as the Minecraft console ports, which makes it worse.The game in itself is enjoyable, to an extent.It hasn't got NEARLY as much secrets or variety as the thing it's knocking off.And even though I'm not really bothered by graphics, for a 2011 game (same year as skyrim released) IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD RUN ON WINDOWS 98.Pretty sure the enemies would suit an N64 game. But I'm also pretty sure the zombie model has been used in other games, so this game most likey uses Unity Engine assets.They even made a verson called CastleMiner that's just creative. They probably made the 2 versions to make more money from you buying them, though CastleMiner doesn't seem to be on steam...hmmm.I give the game:  1 kick in the nuts followed by watching your entire family being tortured to death while on fire/10P.S: the current price of under £1 seems too high for a piece of sh*t like this, it's worth about a penny.

												I got this game for free from a friend since my other great friend cried about getting this game since we played it on the xbox 360. The game wasnt good back then. As a matter of fact i believe its more broken now.  The glitch i saw five years ago when zombies would bend down to eat bodies they would dissapear. That still happens in 2016. This game give you 0 chance to do anything. This game was horrible and it still is. I told him he was blinded by the past. Its horrible, Its♥♥♥♥♥ Not even worth it when free. This game is trash.

												It's a very casual version of minecraft, but dark. After a few in-game days, s#$% gets apocalyptic as hell. It's minecraft with guns, with way less of the complexity of minecraft. The enemies in the game are pretty legit. Running and hiding from them is a struggle. It's not the type of game that you play survival for eons and continue to ""civilize"" the world. You spawn, with a gun, and it's clear to see that there's gunna be zombies and other AI chasing you. You can harvest gold and diamonds and more, use minable materials to make batter tools/guns, and build whatever your little heart desires with different types of blocks. But the game's basically a very casual version of minecraft with guns and apocalypse.Guns + Minecraft+ Apocalypse - Stupid s$%# from Mincecraft = CastleMiner Z			"

												HIGH PIONTS:When i see a game with such good game play and creatures and cool items and some building features I like the offline play myself and so much more...LOW PIONTS:There could be so much more  and if it was not for the low cost, my verbal ratting would be a lot more negative but with this said.  The game has so much potential in making this game way better then the minecraft game.I would have to say building improvements could be a good update, such as building a fortress and adding gun turrets and other cool building items, like steel doors this may be possible i'm unsure.  My opionion as a gamer for over 25 years is there should always be quest set in  ending the darkness that has fallen upon the land would be cool, like dungeons and dragon eggs to destroy to wipe out the dragons and huge underground grave yard undead lairs with a undead king and a hidden item that was the cause of this pelage of darkness such as a meteorite that has fallen many years ago so the land has over grown and it is hidden way deep and very heard to fine, and some type of heated stone that cause your regular iron pieks unable to dig through. That a new quest to find a special item type to make a pike that you can dig through. Digging through finding a  maze of dungeons and undead area blocking your access to its source.			"

												CastleMiner Z Is a great, yet hard game that has screaming sprinting zombies, yelling crazy aliens with knives for their right hand and the ever popular SPOOKY SCARY SKELETON!!! These are brutal and unforgiving yet fun to shoot in the face! the game also has some medeival elements such as dragons, lots of trees and the satisfying blacksmith hammer noise when you craft something. There are also some futuristic features such as lazer guns and swords if you ever wanted to be a jedi or storm trooper. If you don't like getting owned by the undead from the underworld, you can turn the monsters off. The game's visuals are amazing! It runs super quick even on my laptop! It still runs great even with a high visual setting. If building is more your cup of tea, then try the creative mode. I really like this game, and at such a low price the game is impossible to say no to. P.S. the game has a slight chance to slow down in the framerate department, so make sure your computer is well optimized!			"

												very interesting. never know what to expect first time playing. was litterly shaking for my firt play through. as you play you get used to the controls and the enemies. plus the crafting is pure genius. especially for this game being from 2011. love it. needs more stuff to do though, more crafting, maybe stuff in the random gen like dungeons and towns. im 2000m out so far. and i plan on continueing to see what else is out there. i have so much resources and weapons from meteor site mining and mob killing. ive encountered 3 diffrent dragons but killed so many and still have more to see. please keep updating. overall: good game			"

CastleMiner Z (Endurance Mode): How much can you accomplish with your death? Zombies, they are back again. Shuffling, sliding, bursting into blood savagery. How will they get you? It is only a matter of time. Inevitable. A rule programed into the very fabric of these strange cosmos.What do you have for yourself? Let’s check your belt.You have a stone pickaxe, compass, stone pistol with matching bullets, stone knife, and some torches. What are you going to accomplish with your materials?The process:Make bases at about every 1000 block mark or 500 block mark. Build a highway to get back easy. You are going to fail once on a teleport and it’s going to be harder to recover if you have left yourself no infrastructure to fall back on.Mining. It’s slow going, but safe. I should mention that mining is the only way you can easily get back to 3100. Get to 3100, make a base. You are going to HAVE to run across hell. There is no way around or under hell. Have to go over. I typically stay around the 7-11 block mark above the bloodstone level. This is where I find the most diamond. once you hit 2100 then diamond clumps up on the lower levels. Then around 3100 it start to appear on land.You can mine all the way to about 3200/3400 I think, but then you are slowly pushed to the surface. The bloodstone / hell threshold slowly is brought to the surface.Desert - Dig underMountains dig under or through.Frozen Hills dig under - need shovel for snowHell - Fortify - rush in, make a base, die.The tele hop.This is what you use to keep you far in the blocks. It is costly, but it’s really the only safe method of keeping you deep into the block count. Teleporters. The ace(s) up your sleeve. Drop a tele point at your base. Take another one, run as far as you can, drop it there. If you die, that’s fine. Tele back to your base. Pick up two more teles. (At this point you have 3) Drop one tele at your base. Use the tele you ran out with and got far with. As soon as you tele to your spot, drop a FRESH tele. (DON’T USE THE ONE TO YOUR BASE - THIS IS BAD AND WILL SET YOU BACK HOURS!!!)TipsThis game is tough. It is brutal in fact. There are a lot of hard lessons that I’ve learned.I now have a few standard practices that really help make the going easier.Carry your bullets on your belt.Carry your most valuable if not most two valuable resources with you at all times.Don’t carry more than two guns, anything more is a waste of space.Don’t carry a melee weapon, use your pick.Don’t use lightsabers; sure, they are cool looking and make fancy noises, but they have a short shelf life and they take important resources to make.Only have 1 or two harvesting tool on your belt. You’re not a farmer, you’re a survivor, there will be deaths. It is better to die carrying difficult to attain resources than lose them.ONLY KILL WHAT YOU HAVE TO, RUN FROM WHAT YOU CANYou will die, a lot, deal with it, work around the deaths. You can use death to your advantage…..Using your death to your advantage. Each time you die, you go to a place that has both wood and sand. Before you TP back to your base, grab some resources. You will probably need sand, wood and coal at some point. Mainly for storage, torches, and teleporters. Pick some up, better to have and not need if anything.Get to laser weapons as fast as you can, HOWEVER, diamond is still plenty OP.Gold is a step up about stone, but will not take you the distance. I have found that gold does not suffice for the trek across hell. Those zombies are vicious and need to die faster than gold will provide.Lasers - you can kill both aliens and satan easily with laser weapons. You can simply run from either or murder them. They take a full clip or two from the assault rifle. You can use explosives if you have a lot.Don’t harvest in the open.Dig a tunnel through earth and take what is given to you.When you need bloodstone don’t take what’s in the open!It takes 21 hits with the diamond pickaxe to extract which is a long time.It is best to dig into the side of a cave at the base of it and then block the entry way.harvest bloodstone in peace.CARRY A LOT OF TORCHES AND MARK YOUR WAY WITH THEM.You can see torches from a long ways off and help you get back to where you need to go.Use specific formations to mark certain things.If you go spelunking and you find diamond but don’t have the time to extract it mark it with a torch and get it later.Zombies, skeletons, aliens, satan. Zombies come in different varieties with different behaviors; skeletons come in varieties. Aliens and satan are mele hard hitting champions.The achievements make this game worth while.Some of them are indeed quite hard to attain.Self Defense - Kill one enemy (12/6/2014)No Fear - Kill 100 enemies (12/7/2014)Short Timer - Play for  one hour (7/13/2014)Veteran MinerZ - Play for 10 hours (9/2/2015)First Contact - Travel 50 block from start (12/6/2014)Leaving Home - Travel 200 blocks from start (12/7/2014)Desert Crawler - Travel 1000 blocks from start (12/7/2014)Mountain Man - Travel 2300 blocks from start (12/13/2014)Deep Freeze - Travel 3000 blocks from start (12/13/2014)Hell On Earth - Travel 3600 blocks from start (9/5/2015)Around the World - Travel 5000 blocks from start (9/5/2015)Deep Digger - Dig 20 blocks below the surface (12/6/2015)Welcome to Hell - Dig 40 blocks below the surface (12/13/2015) - Don’t dig straight down.Survive the Night - Survive for 1 day (12/6/2014)One Week Later - Survive for 7 days (12/7/2014)28 Day Later - Survive for 28 days (8/31/2015)Survivor - Survive for 100 days (9/5/2015)Tinkerer - Craft one items (12/6/2014)Crafter - Craft 100 items (12/7/2014)Master Craftsman - Craft 1000 items (9/1/2015)Zombie Slayer - Kill the undead dragon (9/5/2015) At 4200 block markAlien Encounter - Get close to an alien (12/7/2015)Alien Technology - Make a kill with a laser weapon (8/31/2015)Demolition Expert - Craft TNT (11/28/2014)Air Defense - Kill a dragon with a guided missile (9/5/2015)Fire in the Hole! - Kill an enemy with TNT (9/5/2015)Boom! - Kill an enemy with a grenade (9/5/2015)MinerZ Potato - Play for 100 hours - Not achieved.28 Weeks Later - Survive for 196 days - Not achieved.Anniversary - Survive for 365 days - Not achieved.

It allows you to express your self in a whole new manner by alowing you to fight a dragons and other monsters which are useless because they are all weak compaired to the knife you start out with.

												I got this game for free from a friend since my other great friend cried about getting this game since we played it on the xbox 360. The game wasnt good back then. As a matter of fact i believe its more broken now.  The glitch i saw five years ago when zombies would bend down to eat bodies they would dissapear. That still happens in 2016. This game give you 0 chance to do anything. This game was horrible and it still is. I told him he was blinded by the past. Its horrible, Its♥♥♥♥♥ Not even worth it when free. This game is trash.

												Difficulty =/= Fun. What sets this apart from Minecraft is that it is hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it has guns. Why won't these dragons♥♥♥♥♥♥off?! Why are there so many skeletons? The game is so dark as well that I even had to turn my brightness up on my screen, and there is NO setting to change that in-game. The enemies come out of nowhere, and are very glitchy in terms of hitboxes. It's a waste of money. I'm not too crazy about Minecraft, but there is a bunch of things that make this game terrible in comparison. Call me the one to be too quick to judge, but my first experience is not enjoyable, and neither will any of my others. Now I see why this game is only four dollars.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Its only purpose was to make a clone of Minecraft before one was avalible on X-box Live. If you think this game is good then just mod Minecraft to have guns and a harder survival mode. You can barely do anything in the game before a zombie 2-shots you and you lose everything in your inventory. The game is summed up by saying it is a cash grab that feels like a 7 year old thought of the mechanics.If you like Minecraft, then play that instead. If you hate Minecraft, don't worry you will hate this too. If you look at the game and think, ""wow that is a cool idea I would love to play Minecraft with guns and dragons in a more mature setting"" like I first did you will soon notice that the game is not even trying to hide the fact it is a X-box port because around each corner it shows you the controls for the X-box. THERE ARE NO REDEEMING QUALITIES OF THIS GAME. It is just an excuse to make a clone of Minecraft. The developers just threw cool stuff together before Minecraft was on X-box and there is NO REASON to port this over to a system that has the original Minecraft already!GOOD DAY SIR!			"

												It's a fun Co-op game. Played for 11 hours today with a friend. ended up having way more stuff then we really needed and when we faced the undead dragon we had 8 anti dragon rocket luncher each. We ended up exploring further incase we missed something, but that was it. I felt like the game could have had more stuff, something more to explore, or something more to do. Like a tradeable village or more bosses or dungeon kind of thing, empty wherehouse for example. The game just felt short and if we hadnt spent hours mining (had around 1000 diamonds) we would have probly played lots less because it felt kinda like lack of content. But the game was really fun nonetheless.			"

												So this game is really bad no matter what I try to do. The enimies are glitchy and they come out of no where, the mechanics are terrible as are the controls. The game keeps on crashing, even at the lowest graphics with no background programs on. 3.99 is not worth this game.			"

												Do you like survival? Or zombies? Or Minecraft?????? Well put them in a blender and mix them all up and that is what this game is. I love this game. It is probally one of the best open-world survival game out there. It is fun, and it is only a dollar. Great game "

												This could be a great game, and I love the concept, but it has a very major issue that must be addressed before I deem it worth purchasing.  Zombie MechanicsI love a good swarm as much as the next guy, but this is a bit too much.  They constantly spawn, even from the very start, giving you no time to get a decent chance.  You do get a gun and 200 bullets, but the reload time is killer... literally.  Buy the time you've reloaded, they're sprinting and jumping.  And they spawn EVERYWHERE.  Even if you've built a nice wall, they'll just spawn on/in it.  I'll count the dragons as zombies, since some of them are undead.  I think the dragons have way too much health for how early they spawn.  These issues would probably be a lot easier to deal with, except that the sensitivity on its lowest is higher than that of most games at their highest.It is, however, nice to see that the devs have started doing things again, so at least it has that.  It could be a ton of fun, so if you don't mind these issues, I would definitely recommend it.			"

												Well, first thing I want to say is I am a huge DigitalDNA fanboy. I love all of their games on the Xbox 360, and I hope that they respond to this review to give me some kind information. I'll begin my review by saying, resolution is a problem. DNA needs to add changing resolution and meaningful graphics settings to make the game playable for more PC gamers. I personally can not give much information about the gameplay, seeing as I can not play the game with it's current graphics, but from the laggy walkthrough I did, it seems pretty similar to the Xbox 360 version. When they update the graphics settings and add changing resolution, I will definitely bump up my review, but until then, I'm one dissapointed fanboy. :(			"

Another reviewer mentioned he would rather drag his private bits through 70 miles of ground glass or something like that. I thought he was going easy on the developers. The LAN play isn't even properly implemented. You host a server, everyone can join. If you switch it to friends only, nobody can join and you can't even invite them... at least that was my experience. As a Minecraft mod, it would have maybe been okay. As a standalone, it's worthless.			"

												Don't believe any of the positive reviews, period. This game attempts to take multiple popular franchises and mash them together into some horrible abomination of a ""game"". The characters look like they're ripped from a Nintendo 64 shooter, the landscape is what you'd expect from a mobile phone Minecraft ripoff, and the enemies look far worse than the House of the Dead shooter that has been around since 1996. If someone got this game for you, they're trolling you. If you bought this game for yourself, no matter what sale it was on, you trolled yourself. I played this game as a test of irony with a friend and I can confidently say we saw all of the content within 2 hours of playtime.			"

												Arguably one of the ♥♥♥♥♥est games ever made.It seems that, in their rush to cash out on the Minecraft and Call of Duty trends, they forgot to add any content whatsoever other than different coloured guns.Even among the 'Minecraft Ripoff' genre it is unremarkable as games like fortress craft and Total Miner have more content and are more fun.However, it's a bit of fun to play with friends while you all laugh at the game's utter incompetence.I would rate it a 3/10 because it's terrible.

												Literally just a modded version of minecraft. Except the mod should be called ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game simulator. with ♥♥♥♥♥ier grahics and horrible gameplay.The only gameplay this game has to offer is shooting zombies everywhere in a randomly generated map, and the resource gathering part of the game is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because of how easy it is just to get the best materials in the game and become insanely OP after just 5+ mins of digging. Then you can go on for a million waves and eventually come across these dragons that are just as OP as you are, but this time there is 500 of them and 1 of you. Literally 1 dragon could tear down a whole base made up of the best block in the game imaginable, making it impossible to `adapt` because of the huge ♥♥♥♥ing difficulty gap. The graphics are comeplete♥♥♥♥♥♥ The zombies look like they came from grand theft auto 2 or 3, with thier choppy, geometric bodies. The animation is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥as well, the sounds are just irritating (THE ♥♥♥♥ING POP NOISE MKDSALHJKSDKWA). There is no story, and no main objective the only story there is is `Here is some ore and zombies, collect the ore make a gun and ♥♥♥♥ them up`. The castle you start out with has no other purpose than to hide on top of like a ♥♥♥♥♥, but even then skeletons snipe you with thier bows (Really, bows?! MINECRAFTTTTTT) or for zombies to somehow climb on top of it and♥♥♥♥♥♥you or something. 2/10 still little bit of fun and costs like 2$ so yeh.Graphics= Aids simGameplay= ♥♥♥♥♥ PleaseSounds= MY ♥♥♥♥ING EARSStory= What's That?

												I started up Castle MinerZ and... straight away the intro music was saying ""no effort had been put into this game"" a few hours later later the intro screen popped up and.. oh... another minecraft rip off, i made a server, added a friend and i was already flooded with random people joining. after kicking them and stetting the server to private (which isn't the default) i tried treating it like an actual game and after looking through the inventory and realising the only few differences were:less pixelation in items and mobs, no crafting tables dispensers of furnaces (just do it with your hands) you dont teleport to the ""Nether"" but you dig your way down to hell, and... of course, guns, lazer swords and RPG's (your annoying-looking character knows how to craft these at from the beggining by the way).And i would say it doesnt have a bad atmosphere... if it didnt have every sound effect copied from other games, from the start-up noise of SCP-containment breach to LEGO sound effects and scuttering from another game i cant remember the name of... and: DUST! DUST! DUST IN MY EEEEYYYYEEEESSSS!!!!!!!!For a game of 2014 you'd expect it not to look like a minecraft/quake hybrid and at least have the textures work properly.. half an hour after i started the world my torch texture dissapeared, and a few minuites after that the game crashed and just told me:  error, the game crashed, we are trying to fix this  my mouse was still locked off the screen so i had to press enter to close the screen and the game, i attempted to log onto my world again... it crashed before it loaded with the same screen.. i tried again and this time it  loaded! and i found out it was a great game and wasnt another crappy rip off and we lived happily ever after   NOPE.. it only loaded the torches... and you.. everything thing i held was invisible and every block and mob except torches.. i logged off.. logged back on... and of course it was the exact same thing... i close it down, uninstall the game and find myself here ive read some other reviews.. and the comments on them seem to be things like ""nyot evry spuar gmae is mincraeft"" and ""its not a minecraft ripoff because its harder and has more things!""to which i say: excuse me  HAVE YOU LOOKED THROUGH THE GAME??!!??  you have shovels, pickaxes, axes, iron, gold, diamond, zombies, skeletons with bows, dragons, hell, 16-bit textures and even the bad AI. THIS. IS. NOT. AN. ORIGINAL. GAME.DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEevereverget it for free of their website for fre............. WHAT!!??!! THIS struck me as unbelievable, i cant see anyone playing and enjoying this game unless they are a 6 year old with no knowledge of games AND extremely high.

												CastleMiner Z had redefined the next generation of video games. From its beautiful graphics to its addicting gameplay this game takes your breath away every step you take. If you love minecraft, counterstrike, Call of Duty Zombies, and ingesting lots of hallucinogens, this game is a must buy on any platform. The mele combat has to be the best I have ever seen in a videogame to date. The gunplay overtakes such games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty. The weapon choices are some of the most creative and most varied selection in videogame history. The game: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a clear rip off of Castle Miner Z's dragon combat, using wit and superior battleskills to take down the mighty dragons. Dragons come in many forms, which provides a nice change of pace, because we all know how boring yelling at a dragon is!  For an extreme deal of $4.99, this product is way to underpriced for its overall gameplay value. If you want to take this experience to the next level try using a gamepad or just simply play it on the Xbox 360! But wait! There is more! Did i mention you can play with any of your friends. No more hastle of making a minecraft server! You can even teleport to your friends without even typing in a single word! This stellar online experience far exceeds the multiplayer immersion of major multiplayer games like World of Warcraft. If you do not have this game, are missing out on a true experience that will change the course of history as we know it! An easy 10/10			"

												I can honestly say, without a doubt, that this is legitimately the worst game I have ever seen. It's worse than Bad Rats, at least Bad Rats actually TRIED. CastleMiner Z is unoriginal from its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mismatching assets to its core gameplay to its name. You play as a normal SWAT Member in a completely blocky world full of Zombies and Skeletons and Dragons. I wish this game was satire or a parody, because then I'd at least have the solace of knowing that someone didn't actually think this was remotely a good idea, nonetheless a FINISHED PRODUCT. Please don't even buy the game as a joke, the developers do not deserve any sort of money for this.			"

												This game is sh*t. When I attempt to start the game, for some reason it does not work. as a result of me not being able to play the game and leaving me with £4 less. As of this I am very annoyed and recamend you do NOT buy this game.			"

												For the a while after I got this game I actually did enjoy it. Though the game's world does kind of rip-off Minecraft (and don't say this came before, Minecraft was late in beta and at the height of its popularity), the gameplay in it is quite a bit different than Minecraft. Basically, the objective of this game is to craft weapons and mine resources, while trying to get further away from the spawn, which will bring the player to new biomes with stronger enemies and better materials. Eventually you will run into the game's boss in the final biome. There is also somewhat of an objective to stay alive for as long as possible.The main thing to keep in mind though, is that this game really isn't geared to building much; it takes a long time to mine anything, and the further out you are the stronger the materials you will need, so the best thing you can build is a small bunker. Also, I find that this game does not expand much on survival; most of the game is trying to get as far as you can killing a few zombies that get in your way, though night-time can be dangerous, the game doesn't provide much in the way of ""surviving"" the zombie horde.To be entirely honest, in the end, I do not recommend this game. Though I did originally enjoy this game it unfortunately does not have much replay value or staying power, and the gameplay is kind of shallow. Of course, on the other hand I haven't played anything quite like this game, and I do think, that though shallow, the gameplay is unique. If it looks interesting, and if you're more of a casual gamer, don't be afraid to try it, just don't expect much replayability.			"

												This is game is just no, the sensitivity is so ridiculous that even at the lowest setting the camera feels like if it was put higher than 100% sensitivity. When you die you start from where you originally spawned so you can't creat spawn points and creative mode isn't even creative mode. Even if it is I should just be given what I want to use to create what I want to create by just being given all the items in a selection in the crafting area. Also when you die you drop all your ores yet sometimes your ores just disappear when you return to get even though it was 3 minutes for you to go back to where you originally died. Plus enemies deal too much damage which is garbage and there is no armor upgrades or crafting new armor . This game just sucks combat is sort of fun, but this game just sucks I thought it was fun at first untill all this other crap happened to me.			"

I still remember playing the game on my xbox 360 with friends and now that they are working on the game again its always a good time to experiment with the new features added. They release new content in very small portions about every 2 weeks which may not include much but on occasion they can go big.TL;DRAn enjoyable and cheap game to play with friends, free updates adding new content, and a classic from the xbox 360 marketplace.

												For the a while after I got this game I actually did enjoy it. Though the game's world does kind of rip-off Minecraft (and don't say this came before, Minecraft was late in beta and at the height of its popularity), the gameplay in it is quite a bit different than Minecraft. Basically, the objective of this game is to craft weapons and mine resources, while trying to get further away from the spawn, which will bring the player to new biomes with stronger enemies and better materials. Eventually you will run into the game's boss in the final biome. There is also somewhat of an objective to stay alive for as long as possible.The main thing to keep in mind though, is that this game really isn't geared to building much; it takes a long time to mine anything, and the further out you are the stronger the materials you will need, so the best thing you can build is a small bunker. Also, I find that this game does not expand much on survival; most of the game is trying to get as far as you can killing a few zombies that get in your way, though night-time can be dangerous, the game doesn't provide much in the way of ""surviving"" the zombie horde.To be entirely honest, in the end, I do not recommend this game. Though I did originally enjoy this game it unfortunately does not have much replay value or staying power, and the gameplay is kind of shallow. Of course, on the other hand I haven't played anything quite like this game, and I do think, that though shallow, the gameplay is unique. If it looks interesting, and if you're more of a casual gamer, don't be afraid to try it, just don't expect much replayability.			"

												This game is an awful ripoff of Minecraft and obviously cashed in on the huge Minecraft craze, especially when Minecraft was not available on consoles. Because of that, it likely did sell relatively well and even made it to Steam. Fun because of how bad it is, but that still doesn't make the game good. Might be worth buying for some stupid entertainment.			"

												Take 80% of minecraft, 10 percent of counterstrike, 8 percent of skyrim, and 2 more percent from alot of various other games...Throw them into unity and blend it all together, and you have...A waste to money.Not a single part of this is original. Literally not one.Worlds are literally carbon copies of Minecraft ones, only there's a lighthouse to serve as a checkpoint. It's indestructible. Hell is like it is in Terraria, only you don't need to go far to get into it. Basically 50 Y levels down is a total drop into hell, pretty much. Hell has nearly no reason to exist, quite literally.Dragons are in this from skyrim, Zombies are in this, skeletons too, that's all you'll have for enemies.Zombies kill you in three hits, Skeletons too, Dragons do so instantly. Hit detection is literally barebones. Damage is dealt before the proper time in the animations.This game has less content than freaking StarForge for crying out loud. Starforge atleast has 4 tiers of tools, and even weaons of different types, and 4 tiers of armors, vehicles, blocks to create your bases with, and terminals to serve as faster crafting stations and a respawn in hte form of a bed... Even chest-like containersThis game however has only 5 block types to craft, 4 tiers of tools, 4 tiers of 2 weapons, no crafting stations, 2 chest types, no armors, no vehicles.Seriously. This game is literally Counter-Strike: Minecraft with 2% of the content, none of the mod support, no ability to make texture packs and easily install them and even swap between them... and all for the literal same price of Minecraft, or Terraria, take your pick.This game, like Starforge is basically evidence that you can make money off of nothing but other people's hard work and that we need a Storefront Quality Control team.Sure, there's a mode called Endurance where you don't save the world, and dying is permanent, but it serves no real purpose. It's just an obligatory ""Hard"" difficulty.Get Minecraft. This game, like Starforge, is a Crime against Gaming itself.Plagarism. The Devs need to learn what that is, and Steam too, due to it still being here.The ONLY thing is has over Minecraft, is it's server browser.This game isn't worth downloading, it isn't worth a dollar, it isn't worth even even one tenth of your dog's crap.It isn't difficult and the game is designed by someone who is clearly not old enough to know what.Final Note: This game has basically no reason to exist. Watching paint dry is more enjoyable and you'll be more likely to do it after buying.			"

												I am going to be one of the oddballs and reccomend this game. Why? Well, I've stuck with this game since it was on the Xbox 360, and I loved it. These are the things that I loved about it:. Similar playstyle to Minecraft.Zombie game. Who doesn't like a zombie game?.Mixture of weapons: Knives, pistols, Lazer guns, Oh my!.Endurance mode, going as long as you can, either by your lonesome or with your best friends can be a good challenge.I had gotten this game a long time ago whenever DigitalDNA was giving out a bunch for only one week a year or two ago. I had this game on the 360, and had played the heck out of the game.  I, at the very last moment, saw that they had the deal, and got it in a matter of hours before the deadline. My computer couldn't handle the graphics, so i uninstalled it and didn't touch it until i got my new computer, but all I did was install it, wanting to play other games. Now, I got it on steam, thanks to  getting an activation code, and have started playing it again.   I've seen the other reviews, and understand why they said what they said. Remember, though: This is an Indie game from Xbox going to the PC, so you shouldn't expect too much from it at first. I say give the game a chance, try it out on the Xbox first if you don't want to spend the 5.00 for it. If you like it, then try out the PC version. Yes, the game still needs the occasional fix, like in-game voice chat, or even character customization, but despite these things, i still love this game.			"

And die.And die.And die.And die.Until you get lucky, find diamonds and get a good gun.Then you'll start getting as far away from spawn as possible.Following the compass, you hope you find the end soon.at only 100 blocks.You 1 shot everything, feeling like God. Then you get 2 shot by a single zombie who runs up behind you.You rage quit.Your friends beg you to come back.So you do,and you get OPrunget 10k blocked.Realise you are nowhere near the end.Push on.at 100k you are getting tired.At 200k you almost give up.at 500k, you're dead.And you restart the loop.To only infinitely play the game.OverandOver.

												I have owned this game since it came out on the xbox 360, its a game that is best suited to multiplayer but can be fun solo too. Cant write about creative as i dont use it those game modes are boring, things should be built with the challenge still involved. Endurance is a mode where you have to survive and travel out to roughly 3500 and slay the undead dragon that appears, this can take multiple attempts and a good few hours so best to do in a group. Compleion of endurance allows you to play dragon endurance mode which is pretty cool however survival is where i inject all my time. built kill and brag your way to fun. Well worth the price so try it. Btw dont build out of dirt or sand when playing in survival			"

												This game is an awful ripoff of Minecraft and obviously cashed in on the huge Minecraft craze, especially when Minecraft was not available on consoles. Because of that, it likely did sell relatively well and even made it to Steam. Fun because of how bad it is, but that still doesn't make the game good. Might be worth buying for some stupid entertainment.			"

												People say sometimes that this is just a coppy of two games but this game is really good in a stand point, if you are good at the game and know what your going the game will be fun and thats all there is to it. The zombies can break to doors so people decied to just stand out side insted of building a hut. And it is orriginal in some stand points you just can base of the demo. and you may say i can't talk good about because i've only played it for 8.7 hours but trust me i've played it longer and for this games price it is really fun just to grab a 6 doller bill and get on with 3 of your friends so i really reccomend getting this game. I hope i didn't waste your time, good bye			"

tl;dr This game FEELS like it's in early access, and is just barely worth 2 bucks, but only if that isn't much to you.PROSLooks kinda like MinecraftGunsCONSGlitches can occurNo block breaking sound along with the large amount of smoke created when mining make it hard to see when you actually broke the block you were miningNo feedback when hitting an enemy. Did you miss? Are you not close enough to knife him? YOU DON'T KNOW AND CAN'T TELL.Not enough options. The smoke I mentioned? That can't be disabled. a whole lot of other things could and should be options but aren't.It doesn't feel like a finished game. It feels like an early alpha.This game, with its abundant imperfections, feels like it's incomplete. There's so much more that needs to be done to make this an actual game. I DO think it's fun ( I havn't played THAT much ), but not very fun.I'm going to recommend this game for how cheap it is, as there aren't that many cheap Steam games. It's worth the 2 dollars, but I don't know how much more you can get out of it :/Btw, devs, if you are reading this, please make the enemies make a sound when you hit them, or turn red, or something? And add a mining smoke boolean option? KTHXBYE			"

												UhNot too sure what to write here im just gonna copy and paste this recipe on pancakes from another reviewIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Not to be played alone!! This isn't meant to be a scary game but it's the scariest game I've ever seen.There's so much I want to say about this game. But overall it's awesome and you should totally buy the 4 pack to play with friends.Pros:TerrifyingCombat-orientedNo hunger or thirst management (Thank God because this game is challenging enough without it)Teleports (Trust me, it'd be damn near impossible without it)Double Jumping (Again, so useful)Just forgiving enough to make gameplay enjoyable, but enough challenge to where it's not easy either.Two item trays (As opposed to Minecraft's single tray)Addictive (Have played from early afternoon to 1 AM without a break with freinds)Health regains quicklyOverall very rewarding gameCons:TerrifyingBroken enemy spawning program (Making the game more scary requiring you to strategically place blocks to prevent the AI from thinking that your building is a cave)Very short stamina barGetting hit by an enemy practically blinds youBroken achievements (Only one achievement has triggered for me and I have met the requirements for most of them)Viewmodels are shoddy (But it's a cheap survival game I mean they all look like crap)All in all, WELL worth 8 dollars for the multiplayer pack.

												This game was really fun, everyone should buy it, however my only grievance is that this game isn't more expensive. At 5$, this game is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too low a price for the though and expertise made by the developers to make a game that will top any gamers Top 10. 10/10, very nice ***jk this game is dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't buy please. spend the money on castrating yourself or something, but not this unfinished, unoptmized, piece of human excrement.***			"

												I tried to give it a fair shake, and to BE fair, it is a decently inspired game, but that's all it is. Inspired. It is minecraft with gunz, if you couldn't tell from the screenshots, but the variety is worse than Minecraft's beta stage from way back when. It is fun for a few hours, if you get past the bugs, but then you hit top tier, and find that you can't even build a nice-looking house.			"

												First off, I'd just like to say you know a game is bad when it somehow manages to screw up the classic Adjective Noun title format. Here we have NounNoun- and there's not even a space between the two words! It also suffers from ""title is non-indicative of game content, better tack on a Z to show it has zombies.""As for the game itself? It's utter garbage. I can appreciate that it still took them time to make, but to go and sell this for $5 is a horrible error in judgement, and should be observed as such. ""Oh but Law, you haven't even played it for more than an hour!"" You're damn right I didn't. I played it for 8 minutes I think, and it's no hyperbole when I say that's all it took to see all the game had to offer. To be fair, 5 of those 8 minutes I spent in the pause menu, because I got up to make a sandwich.0/10 It wasn't even a good sandwich and I had to make a deal with the Devil to get my 8 minutes back.

Personally I think that game companies should stop makeing Minecraft rip-off games because they don't do as good as Minecraft, no matter what! Back on topic, i don't even understand how to play this game. A friend from New York recommended this game to me way back when on Xbox Live. I listened to him, bought it. Personally i had no intrest. So many people say ""Wow, what a great game. It's giving minecraft a run for it's money"". - Ya right, as if! Let's face the facts. Minecraft will never be betten. It's first of it's kind.			"

												Its a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ minecraft clone, and I do mean REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I only played this one for about 30 minutes after I got gifted it as a joke, so far here is what I have observed:-The graphics are repulsive and the models and animations are some of the laziest I have ever seen, as an example one thing I noticed immediately was the pistol model where the characters thumb fazes through the handle of the pistol. Another thing of note is the out of place character models that look like they were taken from another game, everybody looks like a CT from counter strike or something.-Crafting is way less fun then in minecraft, (The thing its trying to ripoff) You do not need to build furnaces or work benches you just get resources and somehow build and smelt things with your bare hands without the assistance of tools. The only tools to speak of are the shovels and pickaxes and etc that you can use to get the resources faster and etc so its really just like a dumbed down less fun minecraft. -There is no hunger or thirst or anything to worry about, just your health which regenerates so there is little to no real ""survival"" element of the game to speak of.-The enemies I observed were: The zombies which in this one are fast and can climb things, during the day you will only encounter a couple but during the night they become really annoying because they spawn right next to you and precede to form a mob in order to kill you. A skeleton with a bow and arrow which shows up occasionally to annoy you.And a dragon which is supposed to try to destroy your base but spends a lot of time trying to destroy the permanent indestructible spawn tower which means you can just shoot at it while It attacks this thing it cant destroy because the programmers were too lazy to make an exception for that building. -Lastly me and my friend went into a server to see what the online was like and my friend wanted to see if the devs even bothered with any kind of anti cheat system, he used a really obvious cheat engine that any basic hack detection would be able to detect and found himself speed hacking around the place with ease, essentially meaning that there is no anti-cheat to speak of.I could continue playing to give a more concrete review but I REALLY dont want to play anymore of this crap. Everything about this game just SCREAMS ""lazy cash grab with zero effort put into it.""			"

												So, normally I'd wait until I at least played a couple more hours before writing something, but it's a different story when there's so little content.Just by looking at it, it might just look like another voxel based game with a texture pack installed, some guns, and a dark atmosphere. However, it's not minecraft. Minecraft at least has reasons to build and explore. CastleMiner Z has little reason to build or explore.If you play the games ""survival"" mode, you'll find yourself rather confused. The goal of this gamemode is to simply run as far as you can. Seriously. As you progress, a meter keeps track of how far you go, and enemies constantly spawn around you. There are caves and ores to mine, with which you can use to craft different tools and weapons. That's it really. SURE, you CAN build structures with an incredibly limited amount of different resources, but there's no reason to stay in one spot AT ALL. The point is to keep moving, and really there's no reason to get attached to your structure anyway as there's little to do with it. In Minecraft, you have to at least keep your avatar fed. In CastleMinerZ, there is no such thing. This means, your only sense of urgency are the enemies, which is fine, BUT NOT ON IT'S OWN.Health also regenerates, however with how fast it drains anyway, that might not be a terrible thing.This means, playing this game boils down to one formula: 1. Run 2. Kill enemies 3. Get swarmed at night 4. Go into cave to mine until day 5. Make Gun 6. RepeatThere is little to do in terms of new strategies except maybe mine all resources in a cave and then move on, hoping you mined enough to make a new gun and ammo for it.I heard this game was $10 on Steam before. I also heard is was $1 on Xbox 360. It should have remained $1. I know the developers need to make their money, but not when you offer very little of value to begin with. Effort means nothing if that effort doesn't have anything to actually show for it.Now, I am being harsh. There CAN be some fun to be had with this game, but not for very long. Once you've played every game mode once, maybe twice, you've experienced all the potential fun this game really had to offer. I played a couple games with random online players, and they usually ended up being children. Which is fine. But I'm an adult, who doesn't always want to play with children. There are also barely any other people playing this game online, so you might as well beg one of your good friends to lay down $5 on this game to play with you.My hope is, the developers aren't abandoning this game as it is. I hope this isn't ""complete"". There could be more content for sure, or at least some respectable mod support.			"

												So, normally I'd wait until I at least played a couple more hours before writing something, but it's a different story when there's so little content.Just by looking at it, it might just look like another voxel based game with a texture pack installed, some guns, and a dark atmosphere. However, it's not minecraft. Minecraft at least has reasons to build and explore. CastleMiner Z has little reason to build or explore.If you play the games ""survival"" mode, you'll find yourself rather confused. The goal of this gamemode is to simply run as far as you can. Seriously. As you progress, a meter keeps track of how far you go, and enemies constantly spawn around you. There are caves and ores to mine, with which you can use to craft different tools and weapons. That's it really. SURE, you CAN build structures with an incredibly limited amount of different resources, but there's no reason to stay in one spot AT ALL. The point is to keep moving, and really there's no reason to get attached to your structure anyway as there's little to do with it. In Minecraft, you have to at least keep your avatar fed. In CastleMinerZ, there is no such thing. This means, your only sense of urgency are the enemies, which is fine, BUT NOT ON IT'S OWN.Health also regenerates, however with how fast it drains anyway, that might not be a terrible thing.This means, playing this game boils down to one formula: 1. Run 2. Kill enemies 3. Get swarmed at night 4. Go into cave to mine until day 5. Make Gun 6. RepeatThere is little to do in terms of new strategies except maybe mine all resources in a cave and then move on, hoping you mined enough to make a new gun and ammo for it.I heard this game was $10 on Steam before. I also heard is was $1 on Xbox 360. It should have remained $1. I know the developers need to make their money, but not when you offer very little of value to begin with. Effort means nothing if that effort doesn't have anything to actually show for it.Now, I am being harsh. There CAN be some fun to be had with this game, but not for very long. Once you've played every game mode once, maybe twice, you've experienced all the potential fun this game really had to offer. I played a couple games with random online players, and they usually ended up being children. Which is fine. But I'm an adult, who doesn't always want to play with children. There are also barely any other people playing this game online, so you might as well beg one of your good friends to lay down $5 on this game to play with you.My hope is, the developers aren't abandoning this game as it is. I hope this isn't ""complete"". There could be more content for sure, or at least some respectable mod support.			"

												I really liked Minecraft so I decided to give this one a chance. I mean, I thought that it was really cool the idea of crafting and using firearms, which is something that you can also do in Minecraft, except that you can only achieve that through the use of mods. Either way, in my modest opinion, this whole concept falls apart when you can't even get a single second of relief in order to plan what you want to do. I mean, there're enemies spawning from everywhere all the time. Yeah, I understand that the game has to be challenging in order to be interesting but in that case, it's just simply annoying. Overall, stick to the mods, you really won't regret skipping this title.			"

												When my friend gave me this I was thinking this would be some type of minecraft clone. I played it myself for around 15 minutes it wasn't too glitchy but it wasn't too fun either. After I played it I asked the friend who gave me this game to play together and it was glitchy as f***. Do I think this game is fairly priced? NO I'd say it should be 2$ as multiplayer is glitchy af and single player is boring.       3/10 Would never play again			"

												This game has potential, and I see what the producers are trying to do as far as horror survival goes. But this game needs more variety of items and weapons STAT! Not only that, I happen to have a laundry list of things they need to add:- A better communication system: I like the fact that you could type to your teammates. Which is a step in the right direction for a lack of a better term. But please consider voice chat because it's faster to give information to player and piers around you.- Sound effects: I would prefer this game to not recycle the same sound effects over and over. Especially the walking sound effect. I'm sorry but the last time I walked on grass, and snow I would never hear my foot tap. It's not that difficult either, just get a boom microphone and gather yourself or a team to go out and record sounds in the real world and import them in your game. -Weapons Variety: Add more guns, and melee weapons. I'm sorry but I don't want just simply cliched weapons that are popular to use. Try to add more modern weapons that would be used in warfare. I suggest looking at GTA V or Call of Duty as a source considering that the games has a variety of weapons that you could look at. So you could study them and recreate them in whatever videogame program you use, and import them in your game.- Too dark in Hell: I understand it's supposed to make Hell scary and makes the player more unwilling to go. But at least light it up a little bit because I just simply can't stand planting a torch everytime I walk through Hell. Not only that, enemies are rampet in Hell, so how the heck am I supposed to walk through the biome if I can't see the enemies?- Enemy Variety: Okay you have so far Skeletons, Dragons, Aliens, Demons, and Zombies. I could count all those enemies on the tip of my 5 fingers right now. Therefore this shows that you need more enemies. If I would suggest anything I say:*Blood thursty wolves(Non-tameable)*Dinosaurs(Like the T-rex, or veloceraptors)*Bats in the caves*Big Spiders*Alien Demon(AKA an Alien boss)*Snakes that attack(Mostly in sandy tarrain)*Evil NCPs we can combat against(Bandits, Burgulars, Intruders, pirates)Boom right there spick and span a list of enemies! You could litterally use anything in a game like this. Usually relevance doesn't really matter in vlox games because obviously we need to be able to have a variety of creatures to fight.- Make the players customizable already!: Honestly during the development of 1.7, you guys should've created those cusomizable characters by now. I'm sorry but, either make them customizable, or give us armor. - Make the players feel more rewarding: Okay grant it, you have the achievements in the game. Though, I would also prefer there to be an experience system within the game itself. Doing this will actually get other players and I to keep playing. Not only that, have a system where you could upgrade your stamina, health, reload speed, etc..-  Have villages, town, cities: There's nothing more boring than just walking through tarrien of empty forests, sandy grounds, and icy mountains. So I would suggest having civilization somewhere in the game. Probably have an abandon town, or something like that. Or at least villages with items and resources you could collect and explore from._________________________________________________________________________________Like I said this game has potential, but there's still some work that needs to be done. 1.7 may have boosted your game visually, but not morale and that urge of players wanting to keep playing is becoming really low. I've played this game since its release on the Xbox 360 in 2011. I thought it was a really fun game at the time, including the 1.5-1.6 updates that I looked forward to those updates in the past. But now the game is starting to suck because we've played through the same kind of thing over and over. That's because there's little no variety, no customization, and little to no fan requested content.Here's the reason why you're still getting bad reviews. It's not getting bad reviews because of the look of the game (Sure that would be the case of picky people who want visually compelling graphics) it's because the suggestion that people give you to make the game even better are practecly being IGNORED. I actually saw little to no changes based on what your fanbase requested you to add to make your game better. Please just enable modding so that the people in this community and who support your game could make it entertaining for everyone else. So you wouldn't have to worry about updating your game every couple months.  Would've I give it a, ""Yes"" if the game was more geared towards a friendly fanbase system. Yeah I would.But sadly I'm giving this a thumbs down. DNA I like the stuff you make, and I'm sorrry. But either listen to your community, or just simply dictate your game however you please and leave out the things that the fans requested you to do. Overall it's your choice, your game, and your call. And that is all that needs to be said... And I'm simply done here people.  "

												The game is like Minecraft on its alpha version. And i quess that the game itself seems to be too...There is much nothing interesting outside, outside world is a dangerous place, and at night it is hell. It is good that its dangerous, after all the monsters from Hell itself have breaken trought, but there is basically no other reasons to go outside, than to cut down some trees to make tools and weapons and to build your underground home to a new placeThe game seems to be like under working and it is like on alpha version. It has basic tools, but only those basic tools. You can build your house, but there is nothing to fill it up, not working benches, furnitures...only crates. You live inside four walls, and there is nothing else than you and maybe a few of crates. The rooms starts to feel really dreary after you have build them. Imagine yourself playing Minecraft and building a house. The house is 10x10 blocks and its under the ground. The walls are made of stone and you have a staircase to surfase and at night you have to block it if you dont have a door. And even if your house is at surface, you have no windows, no beds, nothing to make it feel comfortable, nothing to make it feel special. You dont even know when it is day or night if there wouldnt be that mark what says ""Day (x)"" after a day have passed and its safe to get to the surface again.The monsters are scary, and they make really creepy noises and at night there a thousands of them and they are all screaming above you and trying to scrabble their way to get you... Afterall the monsters are made really well and are creepy as #@%*. There is a big weapon selection, but there is no reason to kill monsters, they dont drop anything unusual, basically you shoot them to defence yourself, but thats all.After all the game is good, but its main con is that it gets boring really fast. You live underground in an empty room and mine to get minerals, what you use to make tools, powerfull walls or to make kick♥♥♥♥♥weapons and to shoot some zombies head to pieces. So, in a nutshell pros and cons:+Big weapon category+REALLY creepy monsters+Destructive enviroment (you AND the monsters can destroy blocks, really big pro)+The game have a nice idea :)-Not much to craft-Cant decorate houses-You spend most of your time mining-A big lack of common stuff-Surface is very boring and there is much nothing to do there-Nothing special at the gameIf there could be something interesting at the surface or something more to craft than just tools and weapons the game would be a little bit more enjoyable The game needs some really big uptades, and i think that this game would be really enjoyable with some extra stuff, just like Minecraft. Minecraft would be boring if there wasent animals, biomes, decoration stuff and a lot off stuff to craft. This game is like simplifield version of the Minecraft: There are mining tools, weapons, crates where you can store your stuff and monsters to make the game difficult. Sounds really boring, eh? I hope that the gamemakers are working hard and have a attitude and have a passion to make the game better and better, to reach the point where it is nearly as good as Minecraft, which the game is imitading. If the game is imitading and is based on Minecraft, why not to imitade even more to make it as good as Minecraft? Now the game would be better if it would be a mod in Minecraft, rather than a game.4/10 "

												NO. NO. NO. STAY AWAY! OMFG... I cannot believe how quickly this game turned me off!! Everybody mentions Pros for this game that can draw people in, and honestly I think they were paid for reviews (bought by Dev or working with Dev). This game SSSSSUUUUCCCCKKKKKSSSSS. I can forgive games, Salt I didn't exactly like because much of it didn't make sense - at least it didn't infuriate me like CastleMiner Z does. The 5th Day is unforgiving, hard, limited to ONE map, only THREE enemies, one of those three enemies can kill you in TWO SHOTS, and there's perma death - I've been playing that BRUTAL survival & craft game for 3 days now, but CastleMiner Z  manages to get me to quit playing in LESS THAN A DAY! Pros:- Pretty cool sky- You can craft stuff, if you TURN OFF enemies and can figure out how to get to crafting- There is guns (but the kitchen knife is better)- Looks like MinecraftCons:- The Sky is the only thing that looks good.- Your character looks like a Counter Strike soldier who was downgraded.- The Blocky world looks WORSE than Minecraft.- Its an obvious Minecraft copy (even tho the license agreement mentions ""no copying"" or ""reverse-engineering"") that manages to be crappy copy.- Enemies spawn from NOWHERE, forget making yourself a safe house, THERES NO SUCH THING AS SAFE! - Easy difficulty? Thats Easy? Are YOU F-ing SERIOUS? Easy if you enjoy fighting a boss quicker than Dark Souls 1. Easy if have no issue with Skels showing up in your base MERE INCHES from you. - Easy Mode, ""Enemies do less damage"". TWO HITS FROM ANYTHING IS DEATH! Lemme guess, Hard, everything insta kills you?- Options: Music volume, Resolution, Texture quality, View distance, Fullscreen on/off, and Mute music on/off. Thats it. SERIOUSLY, THAT IS IT. No controls, No Gameplay options, and no Brightness adjustment. I WISH I was joking, I really do.- Can you retrieve items lost? NO! You'll see your items for a few seconds, but you won't be able to get them back.- Is this game fun? Is dying a lot from BASIC Minecraft enemies ""fun""? What about respawning next to an enemy that kills you by breathing on you, is that fun? There are FAR BETTER games on steam than this crap. Salt is lazy with their Demo, but at least they aren't blatantly obvious.Unturned (free to play) looks more closely to Minecraft than this, its tough, hard, more limited than CMZ, but at least you have a chance at surviving. The Fifth Day has 3 enemies, a brutal survival system, the building isn't great, and there's random lag, but at least its creative and not an instant♥♥♥♥♥♥to you in very beginning.I have NEVER spoken this badly against a game, especially this damn quick.... Now I know why this game is so cheap, because everything in it is cheap. If it ever goes beyond 1.99, you are being robbed.I'll treat this as a lesson in my life - if it looks like CastleMiner Z, STAY AWAY.Rating: 1 out of 10.			"

												According to all known lawsof aviation,there is no way a beeshould be able to fly.Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground.The bee, of course, flies anywaybecause bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible.Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little.Barry! Breakfast is ready!Ooming!Hang on a second.Hello?- Barry?- Adam?- Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up.Looking sharp.Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those.Sorry. I'm excited.Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son.A perfect report card, all B's.Very proud.Ma! I got a thing going here.- You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me!- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye!Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house!- Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry.- Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation.Never thought I'd make it.Three days grade school,three days high school.Those were awkward.Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive.You did come back different.- Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.- Hear about Frankie?- Yeah.- You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going.Everybody knows,sting someone, you die.Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead.I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way.I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day.That's why we don't need vacations.Boy, quite a bit of pomp…under the circumstances.- Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are!- Bee-men.- Amen!Hallelujah!Students, faculty, distinguished bees,please welcome Dean Buzzwell.Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of……9:15.That concludes our ceremonies.And begins your careerat Honex Industries!Will we pick ourjob today?I heard it's just orientation.Heads up! Here we go.Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times.- Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary.Welcome to Honex,a division of Honescoand a part of the Hexagon Group.This is it!Wow.Wow.We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole lifeto get to the point where youcan work for your whole life.Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive.Our top-secret formulais automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contouredinto this soothing sweet syrupwith its distinctivegolden glow you know as…Honey!- That girl was hot.- She's my cousin!- She is?- Yes, we're all cousins.- Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly striveto improve every aspectof bee existence.These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology.- What do you think he makes?- Not enough.Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman.- What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honeythat hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions.Oan anyone work on the Krelman?Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees knowthat every small job,if it's done well, means a lot.But choose carefullybecause you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life.The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that.What's the difference?You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day offin 27 million years.So you'll just work us to death?We'll sure try.Wow! That blew my mind!“What's the difference?”How can you say that?One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make.I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life.But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that?Why would you question anything?We're bees.We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth.You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here?Like what? Give me one example.I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about.Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach.Wait a second. Oheck it out.- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow.I've never seen them this close.They know what it's likeoutside the hive.Yeah, but some don't come back.- Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks!You guys did great!You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!- I wonder where they were.- I don't know.Their day's not planned.Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what.You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that.Right.Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime.It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it.Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it.Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too?Distant. Distant.Look at these two.- Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them.It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock.Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom!He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me!- Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out.What were you doing during this?Trying to alert the authorities.I can autograph that.A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades?Yeah. Gusty.We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow.- Six miles, huh?- Barry!A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it.- Maybe I am.- You are not!We're going 0900 at J-Gate.What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough?I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means.Hey, Honex!Dad, you surprised me.You decide what you're interested in?- Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one.Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day?Son, let me tell you about stirring.You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around.You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing.You know, Dad,the more I think about it,maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me.You were thinking of what,making balloon animals?That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger.Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey!- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny.You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer!- You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me!Wait till you see the sticks I have.I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!Let's open some honey and celebrate!Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae.Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody “dawg”!I'm so proud.- We're starting work today!- Today's the day.Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone.Yeah, right.Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal…- Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left!One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side.- What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar!Wow!Oouple of newbies?Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!Make your choice.- You want to go first?- No, you go.Oh, my. What's available?Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think.- Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on.I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.Wax monkey's always open.The Krelman opened up again.What happened?A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one.Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.Dead from the neck up.Dead from the neck down. That's life!Oh, this is so hard!			"

												I LOVE THIS GAME!!! Its a perfect combination of Minecraft,Guns,Zombies, and other evil creatures. This game features alot it has to be on of the best indie survival games around. Also its simple. If u wanna make a server just flippin go to host server and give it a name and select a world you want ppl to play on. No port forwarding and all that crap thats hard. This game is also fun becasue if your on a car ride or you dont have internet at the time then the game gives you and option to play Ofline. Now about the game. Its fun!!! ITs awesome! and well u get it u survive build and mine to make guns and weapons.      NOW HERES WUT I SUGGEST GAME CREATORS!!! Make an option to MAKE your own character. By doing that you guys can have more money, you can put in a shop were u can buy clothes for real money(not like 6 bucks for a flippin shirt but u get it) or you can even put the more time you play the more cloths and costumes you can potienaly get. But remeber to put a lot of standerd starting cloths to chose from. You do that an you earn your self a 10/10 but for now i put this at a 9.5/10.			"

												BEFORE YOU DOWNVOTE:This game is not a Minecraft clone. It's a voxel survival game, just like Minecraft. It has guns. It has better shaders and texture quality. While right now, it may not be polished since it's a direct port from the Xbox version. It's PC, which means maybe it will be possible to mod the game.  While it does have a few bugs, it's a good game.  Pros:-Good sounds and soundtrack-Guns-Good lighting-Pretty cheap for the content you get-Still being updatedCons:-720p (Direct port from Xbox, probably will be fixed(?))-Can't fly in creative mode-Can still die from fall damage in creative mode-Can be kind of dark			"

												Great Game!I first played this game on XBox 360, and from there on to the PC version while it was free. Now I have it on Steam, and while so many have given this game a bad review I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed playing Minecraft or games like it. This game doesn't have all the things like steps, fences, buckets, and so on but its a lot of fun & a great way to waste time if you want. Have yet to play online with anyone on the PC/Steam version but its still a lot of fun.New Players,1st Stock up on logs from trees & don't worry about dyeing, but be sure to place the logs on your main bar so if you do die you don't loose them. Gather a stack which is 64.2nd Now mine at least 32/64 iron & also place them on your main bar so if you die you don't loose them either.3rd Get everything needed to make a crate, 2 doors, and a few Iron Pickaxes.Once you have these things place your crate some place near the Bedrock tower where you start & put everything in it. Now build a room around the tower & place your doors. This is the best way to start in any mode as it gives you a safe place to get away from mobs as well as to place any items in your crate/s so you don't loose them.4th Build tunnels either above or below grown as far as you like so if you die you can run back to where you were without worry of mobs killing you on your way.This is a great game! Don't listen to the haters who gave bad reviews as they obviously don't know how to play...			"

												Took me a minute to get the hang of it!  Has a simple crafting menu that is easy to pick up on and the monsters are relentless.  Only real complaint is how the monsters will glitch thru the floor.. so always be on your guard!EDIT :Did I say glitch thru floors?  Correction, monsters will spawn out of ceiling when it is dark.  Any dark spot.  Great game, just finished getting all the achievements and I had a blast doing it.  The music makes me feel like I'm on a epic adventure, And as a gamer, I like that.  Even when you get all g'ed up.. those monsters come so hard.. and you can only take 2-3 hits so you just have to stay on your guard.I recomend it for sure.  Now that I have mastered endurance I may just start up a epic survival world.			"

												Ok, there is quite a lot of hate for this game. A lot of people are looking upon the dark side of CMZ.Ignore the things people have harshly criticized this game on. Listen, I'm going to put all the weapons on the floor and you can choose if this game really is worth the price.PRO'S AND CON'S----------PRO'S> There are a decent amount of exploration to do that would keep you playing for hours> It has a decent variety of hostile creatures that you can fight> A BRILLIANT atmosphere (especially when in caves)> A good variety of weapons> Rare finds (E.g. massive alien biome)> FANTASTIC music (just listen)> The graphics make the game feel alive> TONS of biomes with unique properties> Laser swords (Lightsabers)> Explosive weaponary! (Launchers/C4/TNT)> GREAT sound effects> 8 player co-op> You don't need ANY hassle to set up a server that random people can join> Updated/Patched well (every patch helps every aspect)> Lots of different blocks/materials to find> MANY achievements to get> A good variety of gamemodes> Good goals (E,g, Undead Dragon)----------CON'S> No voice chat in multiplayer> Some glitches> More options needed> Resolution needs to be enhanced> No multiplayer modes> More content needed> Storyline required (Basic Story)> More detail in mobs> More randomly generating stuff like crash biomes> Generally more updates> No AUG :( (please add the AUG)----------OVERALLVery fun and interesting game however it lacks quite a few feautres that could easily be added.----------RATING8/10----------Thank you for reading, hopefully the developers of CastleMiner Z read too - (And add the AUG ;) )Please note: This is my personal opinion so please don't be harsh.

												Review updated 2015-10-05 after hours of playing this game. Old review will be at bottom. # NEW UPDATED REVIEW (SHORT)The game has it moments, it shines most when you can get some friends online and just try surviving and creating your base underground. The game gets repetive after some hours so without friends i really dont see the point in playing further after 5-10hrs singleplayer or more. There is no random missions just mine and hide underground. Whole point seems to be to mine and craft better and better guns.Endurance mode - You will NOT stay alive for long above ground. Best is to dig underground from start and then mine the whole way to the end. You cant save in this mode so count many hrs for this. Survival mode - Is fun for a couple of hours but as said earlier game gets repetive with no random missions.Its not the best game but fun with friends on a lan party.GFx 6-10 (Compared to other similar mine games)SFx 5-10Gameplay 7-10Enjoy. I still recommend it as i did have fun. Mostly with friends.# OLD REVIEW!Loads of fun with this minecraft clone aka not clone :) What i mean is that it reminds of minecraft but its more oriented with crafting guns to defeat your foes than just a sandbox.I have fun trying to find items such as copper, iron, gold, diamonds and more stuff i havent found yet. Building and mining is as fun as it was in minecraft but crafting is alot easier and more basic.Can you survive the night? How far can you get before you get hunted down? How many days can you survive? Well its up to you, so give the game a chance. i did and iam enjoying it alot as you can see on gaming hours. :)One note for developer. It wouldnt hurt to be able to create more stuff ingame. And adding som daily quests just to get some more random stuff to hunt for would be cool. And ingame medals screen how many you have completed.			"

												You know you're playing a terrible game when you force yourself to like it. For $3.75 ($15.00/4), this was entirely a disappointment. In fact, I should be compensated to endure such a graphically depressing, purposeless, rip-off of a Minecraft mod. That's right, it looks like some 12 year old took Minecraft (an already novelty game in of itself), drowned it, stripped it of its meat, and left it with iPhone-level selections of bricks, ores, and wood. If Minecraft and DayZ had a son whose set of chromosomes are of abundant numbers, this would be the incinerated fecal matter that arose out of it's rectal orifice.However, 10/10 would recommend sending this as a prank gift.

												This game need's god's help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Holy BibleContaining the Old and New TestamentsTranslated out of the Original Tongues and with theFormer Translations Diligently Compared & RevisedSet forth in 1611 and commonly known as theKing James Version The Old Testament The First Book of Moses, CalledGenesis[Genesis]1The CreationIn the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was uponthe face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face ofthe waters.¶ And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the lightfrom the darkness.And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.And the evening and the morning were the first day.¶ And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of thewaters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which wereunder the firmament from the waters which were above thefirmament: and it was so.And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and themorning were the second day.¶ And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gatheredtogether unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together ofthe waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yieldingseed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is initself, upon the earth: and it was so.And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after hiskind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after hiskind: and God saw that it was good.And the evening and the morning were the third day.12345678910111213 6 Genesis 1¶ And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavento divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and forseasons, and for days, and years:and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to givelight upon the earth: and it was so.And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give lightupon the earth,and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the lightfrom the darkness: and God saw that it was good.And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.¶ And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the movingcreature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in theopen firmament of heaven.And God created great whales, and every living creature thatmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after theirkind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it wasgood.And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fillthe waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.¶ And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature afterhis kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after hiskind: and it was so.And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle aftertheir kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after hiskind: and God saw that it was good.¶ And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over thefowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and overevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.So God created man in his own image, in the image of God createdhe him; male and female created he them.1415161718192021222324252627 7 Genesis 2And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, andmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and havedominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, andover every living thing that moveth upon the earth.And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the whichis the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and toevery thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I havegiven every green herb for meat: and it was so.And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it wasvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host ofthem.And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he hadmade.And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that init he had rested from all his work which God created and made.Man in the Garden of Eden¶ These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth whenthey were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earthand the heavens,and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and everyherb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused itto rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the wholeface of the ground.28293031123456 8 Genesis 2And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became aliving soul.And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and therehe put the man whom he had formed.And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree thatis pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in themidst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.¶ And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and fromthence it was parted, and became into four heads.The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth thewhole land of Havilah, where there is gold;and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyxstone.And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it thatcompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goethtoward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.¶ And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden ofEden to dress it and to keep it.And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree ofthe garden thou mayest freely eat:but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eatof it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.¶ And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should bealone; I will make him a help meet for him.And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of thefield, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to seewhat he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every livingcreature, that was the name thereof.And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, andto every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helpmeet for him.7891011121314151617181920 9 Genesis 3And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and heslept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh insteadthereof.And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he awoman, and brought her unto the man.And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of myflesh: she shall be called Woman [heb. Isha], because she was takenout of Man [heb. Ish].Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shallcleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were notashamed.3			"

												Hi this is my review of CastleMinerZ. I came in wanting to like this game because I had a blast on the Xbox360 with it. I start out in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spawn and try to adjust my grapics because they look like a took a dog turd and rubed in in my face and puked up a game ( The graphics only adjust how you you can see). I find TONS of iron makeing weapons EASY to get and then 15mins later I have the LMG, UZI, Mosin, and my starting pistol and knife with 50 iron left. The game is way to easy when there is no mobs.The mobs are a second thing, they will kill you over and over again. They walk to you slowly and then they charge and when they get near you they slow you down and♥♥♥♥♥♥you head to toe.I rage quit because of skeletor runs beind be with a bow and shoots me from across the map.I get on the endurance mode and its hell on earth. Right when I spawn a dragon shows up and kills me ( Dragons are super rare spawns). I respawn only to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by zombies and killed again. Then I wrote this review.My point is stay away from this game untill it gets more updates.			"

												An amazing game that I've followed and played since it's early Xbox Live Indie Game years. It's great fun to play with friends, it's basically but not exactly like Minecraft, with a hint of an Endless Wave survival of enemies. Which mainly include Zombies, Skeletons, and Dragons. (Yes, I know this also sounds vaguely familiar, but hear me out.) You're not going through this world with dinky little swords and bows. You get GUNS, bro! Rifles, Assult Rifle, Pistols, Shotguns, SMGs, and much more as you battle to survive or just get your resources to make a shelter. It's quite a fun experience, though it'll take some time getting used to as your tools can break while you're using them on trees, and rocks, and so. So most likely you're going to need to carry spares of that pickaxe before you try and mine that ore. But that's just a minor setback for all of the fun experiences to be had! Great game, great creators that listen to suggestions! Overall fun game. (Note: You're obviously going to need a slightly higher end pc to get some decent graphics or framerates.)			"

												I know this game receives a LOT of hate, but I generally like the game. It was ported from the Xbox 360 onto here. I had bought it on the Xbox with a few of my friends before Minecraft: 360 Edition came out, and I honestly spent hours and hours in this game. This is a type of time wasting game that I quite enjoy, and since I bought it when it was on sale, I didn't have to spend much to get a few hours of memories back. All of the players I have met so far online have been very friendly and cooperative. What made this game so special on the 360, is that it used your avatar in place as your character. The soldier characters are kind of wierd, but I don't mind them much. There are many things I actually really, really like about Castleminer Z. The variety of weapons, actually having to make bullet casings and then bullets, the biomes (especially when you start to get out at least 5k blocks), the dragons (May be hard to kill at first, but craft an LMG, makes it a lot easier, and loot is generally worth it), and that there is a Hell. That is found really interesting, seeing that not other games are like that at all. Sure the game may not be for a lot of people or what a lot of people expect, but it still has many positive atributes. I bought this game mainly to complete all the achievements, and I will play the game even after I have finished doing that.			"

												I must say this is a great game and it actually has a goal unlike minecraft.  You get to see how far you can go from spawn and see who is the best at the game.  The further you go the more challenging it gets.  If you do not buy this game shrek will come frome the sky, rip your face off, and rub onion juice inside of your facial tissue.  Then after he is done he will marinate your skin in a boiling pot of onions and then you will have green skin like him for the rest of your life.  This game is awsome so buy it.  Lots of cool guns.If you are going to rate a game I say; you just have to at least have some time into the game for heavens's sake.			"

I'll give this a lot more love when i'm not so busy.Had another short go of the game:The textures are really nice now, and there's multiple game modes and the multiplayer is effortless. And look at the price! You really would have to go a long way to beat this as a minecraft clone.			"

												I was quite suprise this game still got update not like those grab and run games.My friend bought me this game(He buy a 4-pack lol).After play few hours I am interest and do some research and I saw castle miner.Where the hell did the WATER going?! Fun game but strongly recommend to play with friends.Stuff should consider to add:-WATER (able in caster miner but unable to add in to castle miner z that really annoy me)-weather (I would like to see zombie jump scare me at the heavy raining day)-gear(a bloodstone armor is more cool than a diamond armor :3)-more enemies(if we can have dragon and demon and alien why not a kraken?)-And more and more...I JUST NEED SOME WATER to be add in this game.PLEASE.

												many peaple hear are their opinions every day here is mine too!!! I think that this game is prety good . it has good graphics  (not the best just good ) and i love this dragon thing style and the zombies but i still agree tha is a copy of minecraft but it is cheaper has better graphics and it also wanderfull bu his way!! i would say that you should not wait for this game to go on sale to buy it and this game has spooks and adrenaline around every corner. For the best experience play with your friends.AND WHY NOT BUY IT HAS ONLY 5 Euros.Sorry if i have a bad vocublary and if someone thinks tha i said  anything that it isn't trye just write me a comment and i would love to awnser.

												I am recommending this game only because I want to see it progress but it doesn't seem like the developers have been doing much lately. They have a great idea for an easy game to play. I beat the game in 10 hours except for all the time based achievements that I'm idling to get right now.There are a lot of things missing that need to be added; if not, it's rather mundane gameplay. Needs more zombies, dragons, flying monsters, aliens, different types of items, etc. Not worth $5 if you ask me though. It should be $1.			"

												Addictive Gamplay. Simple gameplay and very interesting as far as what you can do.  I'd Recommend this game if you like something you can work on casually or play with friends. The only real downside to this game is it will make people with OCD rabid. There is no way to clear a massive amount of blocks in a very short time. Building a moat for your home will Last you hours alone. For five bucks this game is worth its value.			"

												Take a seat and let me tell you about this hormonal, prepubecent, piece of cashmire coat hiding drugs from across the border. The first thing you'll notice after buying this game is the name, if you hadn't previously realized: The name is CastleMiner Z. Castle Miner Z. The real title is ""Redesigned Minecraft without Randomization and Order"". Which isn't bad or anything, they just messed up on the name when they released it.Do you know what the game ""Gang Beasts"" is? If not, go look it up right now.That's unrelated.Anywho, if you like Zombies, dicking with your friends (literally?), and/or becomming a single mother with 6 children, this game is the game for you.

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												First Impressions:This isn't the most in-depth or stable open-world builder I've ever played, but there's multiple game modes and multiplayer available making five bucks a small price to pay for potentially many hours of playtime.  Crafting is fairly easy, though tool-tips would have admittedly been nice.  Customizing keybinds partially works, but the defaults still activate when in the crafting menu (Q still throws an item in your inventory, even if throwing is bound to another key).  Still, it does more right then wrong.

												The game is awfully fun, I'd just think it needs some more work put into it... You can't craft much, you can't do very much, You can explore and get pwned by dragons, but other than that, It needs more work. I'd also fix the flippen Demon Hitbox. You have to hit around his **** to atleast deal Damage. Aliens also could use some work. If your mining SpaceRock and SpaceGoo, and then all of a sudden, an alien spawns in you and Murders you. I Lost so much hours of work that way. If you want to buy it, go ahead, but at the moment, Buying the game on sale is better. The game is really worth it, but keep in mind that it has NOTHING related to minecraft, and the zombies Tend to outrun you, and the farther you go, the harder and faster zombies will be.			"

												Castleminer Z is a game we all know, it just has a different skin.I've played this game for 200 hours+ on Xbox 360, don't let my play time fool you. This is easily one of my top 10 games I have ever played. Why you ask? Well let me explain it to you.Castleminer Z is a game where you collect resources, craft weapons, and fight hordes of zombies, spooky skeletons, dragons, aliens, and even Satan himself. Not only can you fight, but you can also build forts, and travel vast distances that will can make your friends wonder why you play this game so much.  This game can challenge you, and make you feel proud that you got that far and killed that ice dragon.  This is al well and good, but lets take a look at some real ups and downs.The Pros-   Fun sandbox gameplay   Familiar FPS feel   Co-op   PVE/PVP   Building   Ranged/Melee combat   Good difficulty scale that can make you stop and rethink your plan/strategy   $5 is a good price point The Cons-   Performance is mediocre   Not many graphical options, but some coming soon   Sensitivity   Game can feel boring without friends (opinion)   Boring, recycled textures from another game (Castleminer, only on Xbox 360)   Zombie hording can massively overwhelm and kill you almost instantly   Was a game that went with the trend of voxel graphics   PVP is there, but not very exciting (may add more if i come up with stuff)All and all, Castleminer Z is a pretty good game. I could recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Minecraft and likes survival zombie games. $5 is a good price point for this product, and a sale rolls around every now and then. If you can, get some friends to pick up the game or buy a four pack to play together. If you want to know more about this game, search it on youtube, there are plenty of videos on it from 2 years ago when this game was the♥♥♥♥♥♥on Xbox 360.			"

People dont see that the game being updated regulary but there are no patches, its just updates and within them updates come all the patches so the bugs arent fixed very quickly, however, I really think the game has potential to evantually become as popular on Pc as it was on xboxOverall: 7.5/10, Good game with potential but many bugs			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												1. It does indeed smell of Minecraft™2. True, it does lack option in the way of PC end-user preference3. And also, I agree that the world feels kinda empty; events arent varrying enough quite yet even after a little playthroughBut, I've read on the steam forums for this game a post concerning the need for updating, considering the game's current instance. The OP asked, ""Will there be additional updates?"" followed by the sub-statement, ""they are still updating and fixing this game right?"".Then the dev responds, ""Yes, we are still working on the game."" Very (hopefully) relieving words, as this game has a lot of potential. Hardly anyone is a stranger to the zombie interjection taking up gaming as of late, but a voxel based zombie game sounds interesting enough. And it's nice to see some level of competition against the (personally) overpriced 7 Days to Die™ (in it's current state). But all of those things aside,4. It does control smoothly5. Crafting system is adequate and carries itself so-so6. Exploration is actually interesting (to me)7. I have not noticed any graphical issues on high (yet)It seems that somewhere, while checking into the game deciding whether to buy it or not, I had read a response from the developer that they intend to close the gap on issues such as missing chat features and such. Another poster in the forum that I originally mentioned had the great idea of opening this game up to the Steam Workshop, an idea I believe will be a saving grace for the game's replayablity, just like all games that go that route.In short, it does need work...but I personally sense potential in this game, and since the devs say it is work in progress, I think it will be a worthwhile purchase, especially if you love voxel games and/or zombie games.:::::::ONE DEFINITE THING TO MENTION TO THE DEV/DEVS:::::::                         If this is in a beta-form, like I have read in various (cant remember where at the moment) then it would be most helpful to mention this in the 'store page' of the game. If it's in there somewhere and I missed it, sorry, nvm.			"

												The Game does feel a little incomplete. However if you are looking for something like minecraft but with more focus on dealing with fighting mobs then this is a must have for the current price. On normal night time is a time to be scared if you are outside. A few problems come with the lack of being able to change resolution settings or controls. This game is a challange if you want to get to the higher level weapons and tools but rather easy if you want to keep it simple and use lower tier. I do hope for some updates that will generate random worlds instead of the same one, and better resolutions.			"

												I've followed this game since it's first day on Xbox Indie, and it seemed to a lot of people, just a minecraft clone. Which at the time, it more or less was. CastleMiner, a creative game that let you play with a few hundred blocks and let you unlock newer blocks by placing, more rocks. Then a few months, probably after CastleMiners success, this game bubbled up and I whipped that♥♥♥♥♥♥up as fast as I could. The first thing I may have noticed was that the sounds were a bit poop, but eh, the guns had bullet drop. I played it for about a month straight, making trenches across the whole map and using them as halfway bases. I essentially stopped playing the game after coming over to PC, and played it now and again. And boy was I glad when I logged into Steam to see this in New Releases.You've got four modes that you can play in this, they are described in the description, I have never even tried to unlock the Dragon mode, it seemed too hard, but I have gotten hours of fun out of it, and for $10 I think that's a good deal.

												There is a lot I can say about this game, with probably around 200+ hours played on the Xbox I am here to say this game is really amazing. Yes, the port has been pretty much taken directly from the Xbox but it's a work in progress but even then, it still plays real well on the PC. To the gameplay/features, if you enjoy building your own forts, castles or whatever then defending it against mobs of zombies, skeletons, dragons, demons, and aliens then this game is for you. It has quite the range of weapons such as normal shotguns and pistols to laser guns to rocket launchers and even light sabers. Then the landscapes/biomes I really enjoy a lot (Biomes are the forest, vertigo forest, desert, mountains, tundra, the desent, alien crash site and of course, Hell!) the world is HUGE. The further you head out into the world, the harder it is to survive. If you can reach distance 4,000, you will be able to fight the undead dragon which I always thought was pretty fun to do especially with friends.The game isn't perfect by all means and one thing I will take away from the game is the lack of variety of blocks as compared to the first Castleminer which has a very large variety to choose from, I hope to see some of them return in the future in Castleminer Z. Ignore the people who claim this game is just a Minecraft clone just because you can build things with blocks, block building does not mean it's a ripoff. If that was the case then every FPS would be a ripoff of past FPS games.But, this game has evolved so much since the day it released on Xbox, many amazing features have been added and even more to come. I for one am really looking forward to those.			"

Don't be fooled by the negitive reviews as they are based on the xbox version with is very different from the PC version with was just released today. There is a demo on the dev site so check it out if your really interested. It's a fun game with a lot of future potental now that it's on Steam :-)			"

												CastleMiner Z - Indie Game ReviewOriginality -Many people have been saying this game is a knock off of minecraft. I can see how you would get that but the truth of the matter is it isnt. CMZ takes place in a block based enviorment. That is the only thing the two games have in common. That is the only link between the two games. And now I know someone is gonna send me a private messege saying ""The games both have pickaxes"". No♥♥♥♥♥♥ Without pickaxes the world wouldnt be where its at today. So a pickaxe is essential for anygame of this type. Overall I give the game a 8/10 for Originalty because the only thing i have seen in other games that is in this game is the terrain. Everything put into this type of game is a one of a kind. Quality - The games graphics are pretty good. Better then minecrafts 16x16. The textures in this game look like there above 186x186 pixel range. So items are pretty high quality. The character models are kind of derpy and i would recomend that we should have a character builder. Also NPC's are pretty derpy. But there hitbox is good in my opion. The game runs very smoothly even when your recording. It supports FULL CONTROLER SUPPORT which is just AWESOME!!!. Even though you were able to have that in the beta. So for quality I give a 7/10 because the character models and NPC's are very derpy and need some work. Im done talking about the game and now im going to talk about what i think the game should have.So the game is missing a few things. One is armor. Enemies kill you so fast. I think armor is a must. Steam workshop is also needed. In a game like this there is a lot of potential for modding support and great community ideas that can come to life. Last It needs BADGES, TRADING CARDS, EMOTIOCONS, AND BACKGROUNDS. I love collecting those things and I think it would help promote the game and make it more fun for users to interact with each other. Stop reading this BS and buy the game :D			"

												This game is great!! It is really fun!    But there are a few weird bugs: When the enemies (zombies, skeletons, ect...) crawl out of the ground in the middle of crawling you can't shoot them, and also if there is an empty space next to it then they crawl out of nothing (ie. floating block, crawling out of next to block, you can see their whole body in the middle of crawling, which is weird).

												CastleMiner Z is a sandbox game where you can build and survive against very dangerous monsters. Now, most people are giving this game a REALLY bad name. I just bought it today, played it for about 2 1/2 hours, and had a pretty awesome time with it. It has a lot of variety weapon wise, and plenty of monsters for you and your friends to kill, and it's just a pretty good game to pass the time. There are also a lot of really cool places to go, like Hell, or Oreland.True, sometimes it has its bugs and glitches, and there could be more building blocks in it, like in my case, I wanted some fences and glass for my mansion, but they weren't available. There aren't a lot of options for graphics, but it doesn't really seem that this game takes a whole dumptruck of RAM to run. People play this for a half hour and think ""This game sucks"". Well ya know what? This game came out pretty recently. It's going to update of course and they will be fixing bugs. This game gets updated quite often people! Don't let everyone make you believe a game is crap based on their experience playing it!			"

												There's something to be said about creating an addictive experience - but there's nothing really that productive about it and no real story centered around it.  It's quite repetitive, yet an oddly pleasant diversion for a casual shooter.  I actually enjoyed the experience.			"

												definately worth the 5 bucks. ya, there may not be much, but the developer is still making updates to improve the game, and listening to fans. as it stands now, the game is decent. chatting is hard though since its very limited. in the settings, the graphicks go to loqwest to highest, orly effecting the render distance, so thats a bit annoying that i cant lower the overall graphics.      the sensitivity on mouse cant be lowered, so at first that annoyed the hell out of me, but i got an xbox cntroller, so used it. if you have been playing this on xbox and thinking the pc version is gonna be better, its absolutely not at the moment. no avatar custimization, no voice chat(unless using skype, team chat, ect.), less people playing(from my experience), and can be a bit boring sometimes. however, there is an update coming out that will fic graphics and mod support is being worked on, so the devs may turn this around.      if i knew that the pc version looked identical to the xbox version, to be honest, i would have just saved my money. however, if you dont have an xbox and you are willing to forgive its lack of custamizationin both the player models and settings, then you will not be dissapointed. since its a minecraft inspired game, you can build a base, house, or whatever, and still defent yourself against the zombie outbreak to see how long you can last.      i give this game a 5/10. i love the game, but as it stands, its an average game. with future updates, and new content, i see this game being a 6 or 7 out of 10. but if u have xbox and connected to the internet, please buy it there. same game basically, and mabye even better on the xbox depending on how well your pc can handle games.

												This game is pretty good. I don't know about everyone else but I am excited to see any new additions (preferably something to majorly branch off from the 360 version's content) that they add to this. It would be nice to see a Teleport to home or be able to set a waypoint to Teleport to it. (as I have lost many houses on the 360 version) there is a lot of potential for this game though, like maybe adding character customization, maybe adding armor (Like maybe power armor made from Space Goo and Diamonds). I give this game a 10/10 and suggest it to those of you who want something a bit different from minecraft. I even gifted this to my friend for his Birthday and he said he liked it too.			"

												A very enjoyable game. Similar to Minecraft in many ways, Castle Miner Z looks so much better and is actually a game with aggressive and deadly enemies, rather than the 'cutesy' Lego simulator that is Minecraft. It may have less of a range of building blocks, but the endless fun both overground and below the surface makes for addictive gameplay. A good, fun, and addictive action game that looks great and plays well.			"

												I had fun with this back on Xbox, but the game is bad. The textures are bad, the physics are easily the worst part of the game. And worst of all, it has been abandoned by the developer, it hasn't been updated in over a year and no word since. There is no direction to CastleMiner Z. I get what they are trying to do, but it doesn't work, because there isn't really a whole lot to do. Ok you have the best weapons and a really awful looking house of bloodstone. Now what? Shoot zombies? I mean, there's nothing to do. You could say ""why not just build♥♥♥♥♥♥"" because building isn't fun in CastleMiner Z. There is no water, Building blocks are extremely limited, There is no animals to breed, no exp to farm only 1 boss to fight, and there isn't much you get from killing it. The game is empty. Oh and there's no fov slider so if you like high fov, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck. It used to be my favorite indie game on Xbox, but TBH I give it a 4/10 Underaverage. If you want a Minecraft Indie spin-off, go grab Total Miner: Forge when it releases on steam... If it ever does. Or get it on the 360 now, They are still updating and it's turning into an RPG which I am quite fond of.			"

												I enjoy these types of games - but I dislike the lack of content it currently contains.I would say this game has good potential - and I feel in time it may become interesting.I am pleased that development for updates has resumed with a new team in place!Features I would like to see are as followed:Some more items like armor, maybe some more tech, more blocks for building, etc.Im pretty happy with the weapons, more would be cool though.I'd like to see more creative mode features - like actual invincibility, a full item inventory to acquire items.I think flight could be a cool thing aswell - maybe some craftable dragon wings or something like that.A campaign for survival - a horde mode perhaps, and a tutorial for beginners would bring more variation.I will give this a recommendation - although my current voting for this game would be to wait for more features.If you like simplicity then this game is probably down your alley.

												I enjoy these types of games - but I dislike the lack of content it currently contains.I would say this game has good potential - and I feel in time it may become interesting.I am pleased that development for updates has resumed with a new team in place!Features I would like to see are as followed:Some more items like armor, maybe some more tech, more blocks for building, etc.Im pretty happy with the weapons, more would be cool though.I'd like to see more creative mode features - like actual invincibility, a full item inventory to acquire items.I think flight could be a cool thing aswell - maybe some craftable dragon wings or something like that.A campaign for survival - a horde mode perhaps, and a tutorial for beginners would bring more variation.I will give this a recommendation - although my current voting for this game would be to wait for more features.If you like simplicity then this game is probably down your alley.

												This game is a good classic on the Xbox 360, but on the computer, it is way too hard with the dragons and the skeletons and zombies. I would only reccomend this game if you have a good gaming PC that can run 1080p. Otherwise, i don't reccomend this game. The framerate has to be high to play it and the graphics on it aren't good at all. It's better to play it with friends because it will give you a more enjoyable time playing it, but it will also be very hard, but not as hard on solo.			"

 KEEP TO MINECRAFT, AVOID THIS GAMEI am a very open minded person and I like most games, but this game........ this game is extremely unpleasant to play, I have owned this game on Xbox 360 and assumed that this would be just as good, but I was wrong. I am aware that I have only played this for under 10 minutes for me to conclude that this game is beyond horrible, I dont have much developing experience in games, but it looks like this game was developed on a computer with no monitor.There is barely anything to do in this game, and it insults alot of minecraft fans with this attempt of a Minectaft-style FPS. If you want a minecraft-style FPS, I am sure there are mods or modpacks like the verious platforms; Fead the beast and Tekkit, to have the same gun theme as this, but with the safety that it is FREE, stable, and still keeps to the base of MInecraft. There are also so many texturepacks that you could obtain on the minecraft forums and websites. All i am saying is keep to Minecaft and forget this ugly attempt of a game.			"

												This is a pretty nice game and I've enjoyed playing it with friends. Most stuff is like Minecraft, but sort of playable in a way that feels vastly different to minecraft, and is really fun. There's a few bits and bobs here and there that need patching up, and it could use a lot more content, armour, requirements other than materials for better things, more things to spend resources on once you reach end game, and stuff like that. But overall, its pretty fun.Multiplayer is even better to play, as you can go around mining, killing dragons, raiding those floating space things for resources to make space guns, and stuff like that with friends. Basically, it's just awesome to play with friends. Although I played a bit of this game with friends for a while, it took me 20 hours of gameplay and looking around on the wiki as well to figure out where all of the server stuff is such as kick players, making it private, and putting passwords on. So for a good 15 hours or so we were paranoid about randoms coming and joining, then stealing all of our stuff. This happened quite commonly.Anyways, the game is really fun in singleplayer and multiplayer, and I actually like it as much or more than Minecraft. Graphics are alright (what you'd expect from a block game like this), gameplay is pretty fun, but the only thing that could be worked on that I've noticed is the amount of content in the game, as at the moment there's a limited amount of blocks, and outside weapons and tools, there is next to nothing to craft.So, all in all, I rate it 8/10ALSO, to anybody who hasn't found the server stuff yet and wants to play with friends, you press escape, and then go into options, then Host Options at the top. From there you can kick players that are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and also make the game private and stuff like that.			"

												Wasted Hours upon hours of time on this stupid game. Playing endurance mode with friends and on several occasions hours into the game, someone gets disconnected for any number of reasons that may or may not be related to the game it's self. The annoying part is that this game mode has absolutely no save or reconnect ability. once the host's game crashes, or your laptop dies, or your internet disconnects, you loose all hope of finishing your game. PLEASE DEVELOPERS: allow an autosave feature for game crashes, allow players to Reconnect and have the same stuff as they did when they left.			"

												This is, as there are many now, a miner-style game. However, this is one of the better ones. This game not only has the general fun, pvp, and free-sandbox style of feel to it, but it adds a 'defensive' sense to it, whereas you are not safe during the day or at any time really. I've played this game for countless hours on my Xbox 360 and now have purchased it on Steam, so this review encompasses both games. This game adds the sense to a mining-sandbox game like no other in the concept that there are constantly hostiles (zombies, skeletons, and even flying dragons!). You must always be on the lookout for monsters outside of your fortification, and more often than not, be cautious inside as well! At first I figured this game would be cheap in quality in comparison to the price, however it clearly surpasses the price in quality. There are many weapons to choose from and different qualities. The main flaw I have with this game is that there aren't many 'creative' items to build. Besides your standard tools, you can only build doors, torches, and walls. I would like to see more items, however this is still worth the $1.99!Pros--Sandbox game-Mining game-Always monsters-Adds a 'defensive' spin to the game (always makes me feel as though I need to construct an elaborate bunker)-Cheap in price ($1.99 is definitely worth it, I'd be willing to pay up to $15-20 for it)-Automatic climbing (you don't have to spacebar every block, you can actually just move forward and move up blocks)Cons--Would like to see some feature to increase the sunshine when in daylight, always cloudy to some annoyance-Not meant for creative minds, very few blocks to build with other than walls-Seems to be a game you play at first for a few hours, stop and forget for a few days, then remember and play again			"

												I got this game gifted to me and just laughed and figured it would be horrible, just by looking at the picture. But then 4 hours of playing later, it's actually a really fun game. Yeah the graphics aren't the best, but the shear insanity of the game makes up for it. Going to each biome and fighting the biome-based dragons is one of the best things about it, they get harder the farther you travel, and you get decent loot from them too! Another thing that makes this game great for the price that it is, is the fact that you're never really safe. Whether you're mining in a cave, or you're outside wandering the biomes. There's always going to be messed up looking aliens, zombies, and skeletons shooting their arrows at you from a far. Also the fact that in caves they just magically fall from above you and land on your head is terrifyingly great, you never expect it and it scares you every time, sending you into a panic and firing an obseen amount of bullets into their faces....mind you that is really satisfying. Also the variety of weapons that you can get is awesome, nothing beats pulling out an AK and completly destroying mobs. To sum it all up, in my opinion this game is 100% worth $2. I would still buy it even if it was more that $2. So buy yourself a copy and get ready to have some fun.			"

												definately worth the 5 bucks. ya, there may not be much, but the developer is still making updates to improve the game, and listening to fans. as it stands now, the game is decent. chatting is hard though since its very limited. in the settings, the graphicks go to loqwest to highest, orly effecting the render distance, so thats a bit annoying that i cant lower the overall graphics.      the sensitivity on mouse cant be lowered, so at first that annoyed the hell out of me, but i got an xbox cntroller, so used it. if you have been playing this on xbox and thinking the pc version is gonna be better, its absolutely not at the moment. no avatar custimization, no voice chat(unless using skype, team chat, ect.), less people playing(from my experience), and can be a bit boring sometimes. however, there is an update coming out that will fic graphics and mod support is being worked on, so the devs may turn this around.      if i knew that the pc version looked identical to the xbox version, to be honest, i would have just saved my money. however, if you dont have an xbox and you are willing to forgive its lack of custamizationin both the player models and settings, then you will not be dissapointed. since its a minecraft inspired game, you can build a base, house, or whatever, and still defent yourself against the zombie outbreak to see how long you can last.      i give this game a 5/10. i love the game, but as it stands, its an average game. with future updates, and new content, i see this game being a 6 or 7 out of 10. but if u have xbox and connected to the internet, please buy it there. same game basically, and mabye even better on the xbox depending on how well your pc can handle games.

												So you can get it on xbox 360 for $1, but it's like crap compared to the $4 version on steam. now before you judge it for it's graphics, few mobs, and some glitches, think of it this way; it's an indie game. in fact, it's above average for indie games. it has many ways of playing the game; get as far as possible, build a base in a land of ores getting invaded by zombies, hunt down the creatures of the night, and, if you kill the undead dragon in endurance, survive the ultimate dragon invasion!now, does it get boring at some point? of course! but think about it. every game does. even Minecraft.spend your money wisely... on castleminer z!9/10 would get slaughtered again.

 Pros   Good co op game.  Atmospheric. Somewhat. Cons   Feels like a ported mobile game.  Only fun for a couple hours. Unless you like building huge structures in creative.         Which just isn't me.   Survival is repetative as anything.  There are more cons than this but i'll keep it short for the sake of viewers looking for a quick overview.Overall, I would not normally recommend people buying this game. It's not long lasting.  "

The only thing you can do in the game, is kill zombies, make better weapons, and then kill zombies.			"

												this game is down right terrible. who ever created this game should get brutally murdered because of his/her dumbass creations. everything may look as awesome as it looks, but in the nutshell, everything is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. you started out on a land next to a tower, a tower that doesnt do anything at all and it doesnt make any god damn sense. once youre in a mine, it takes FOREVER to find what you need the most is diamonds. but they are more rare than minecraft diamonds. and right after you get all that loot, then you get attacked by a zombie or natural things happen in the game and right before you try to get your stuff back. all your stuff is GONE! because they disappear too fast and its just that god damn ridiculous, and you shouldnt lose your stuff that fast not even on minecraft because its way more better than this garbage what you call ""castleminer Z"" they should call it ""castleminer Zero"" because of its stupidity and no good excuse for a horrorbile game like this. and also PUT A ♥♥♥♥ING SPRINT BUTTON ON THIS GAME!!!!! the zombies are way too god damn FAST! and they jump HIGHER! RIDICULOUS!!!...or just slow them down for gods sake. if you want to make this horrible game more better than it usually is. put a god damn bed in it! because the night where all the zombies come out and you just have to sit there and wait till it passes or you just keep getting annoyingly killed by them easily. and you know what else. i think you just want to let the people buy this stupid game for money and thats all you care about. and right after you got all that god damn money, you wont even going to bother to update this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ a person like me that i really want this game to be good, but its NOT! i thought it will be the best game that ive ever played once i first met it. but i guess i was just wrong, because of your dumbass creations screwed me over! and thanks to you. you made me addicted to this game. because you let people buy this game and after that, they shove it in their asses and they think its good, but its not because its♥♥♥♥♥cancer that it just gave me. but i couldnt stop shoving that damn game up my♥♥♥♥♥because of your ridiculous creations and thats the type of cancer you just gave me. so thanks ALOT! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												Oh man what do i have to say about castleminerz, Well a very very good game and here is why: How to progress in this game is not as complex as you may think nor is it too easy it is a sort of moderate difficulty, but of course you can change from starting with a pistol, knife, 200  bullets , and a stone pickaxe + compass To COMPLETELY NOTHING (hardcore mode ) As they say, real men play hardcore!                      Hardcore vs  EasyHardcore is for real menEasy is way too easy no enemies difficulty is for people with no conscious mindHardcore is more challenging Hardcore Actually increases The total playtime to complete every single thing you possibly can And i mean everything (so basically a 1.99 $ game is now worth like 10$)On easy there are like 8 enemies per night (Have played 22hrs or something like that so i know this stuff)In hardcore enemies are more tough adding up to to them almost killing you every time wich is a good/bad thing :/And one of the best parts:DRAGONS! Oh mai gawd the dragons are awesome  Each one giving you different loot, So for example if you kill the same dragon like 200000000003489334754849 times after like 50000 You may only get a copper bar  Because the game can sense if you have killed it and it is too easy, so sometimes it may be nothing at all! I love this because it adds more sense of exploring to the game, so if you enter a different biome, the main element that biome is made out of, That elemental dragon will appear! <3 <3 <3 And There is another thing, Aliens! The toughest enemy in the game! Out of all the laser tools and weapons i have made, not once have i defeated an alien with ease. And you also have to explore to about 800max blocks in a certain direction (randomized) To see the crash site of an alien ship. More exploring Mah favourite! And + THERE ARE WEAPONS LIKE GUNS NOT JUST SWORD AND BOW LIKE MINECRAFT This game honestly, to me makes minecraft look like a total fail (not toally but partial) So ther are: Diamond guns gold guns bloodstone guns conventional guns (normal ) And different types of bullets too! This is amazingly cool         END                                                          OF                                        REVIEW			"

												In conclusion, let's just say that this game is playable, but maybe not for too long.Bought this game on a sale, played it for a couple of hours, I think Castleminer Z is quite fun, if you have some friends to play with. Blowing mountains, digging through hell, fighting Satan, kill a bunch of aliens. You can do that, just like the other sandbox games.However, unlike the Minecraft and Terraria or some other sandboxs, you can't take this game as a building game, because there's no furniture. Yes, I said that, there's no furniture in this game. This, is the main downside of this game. And the blocks ain't that varies either. You can build a big mansion, yes, but only with total same blocks and without any tables nor chairs, only doors and torches. Oh, and there's no water.It basically take the fun out of the game real quick, for there's only few things to do. So if you wanted to buy and play this game, make sure it's on a sale, and there's a couple of friends. Play with them, that's where the fun is.			"

												when i first played this game it was back when XBOX live indie games were a thing, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knock offs of really popular games and being charged a dollar to have the full game.out of all the knock offs of minecraft this one takes the cake for being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knock off of minecraft but with guns, more dragons, an actuall hell with demons, aliens in crashed meteors and lazer weapons (advanced warfare anyone?(this was released BEFORE advanced warfare was announced))since i lasted played this on the xbox the meteor thing happened and that was the last i heard of the game, fast forward to when i purchased this so much stuff has changed, demons are larger (at least larger than i remember) monster spawners are scattered as well as loot boxes and the menu is right ♥♥♥♥♥ to navagate.there's only one other good minecraft knock off that i played that's also an indie game but that's for another review (if it's even on steam)anyway i recommend this to anyone who wants a minecraft knock off that ain't half bad nor half good.

												CastleMiner Z is a sandbox game where you can build and survive against very dangerous monsters. Now, most people are giving this game a REALLY bad name. I just bought it today, played it for about 2 1/2 hours, and had a pretty awesome time with it. It has a lot of variety weapon wise, and plenty of monsters for you and your friends to kill, and it's just a pretty good game to pass the time. There are also a lot of really cool places to go, like Hell, or Oreland.True, sometimes it has its bugs and glitches, and there could be more building blocks in it, like in my case, I wanted some fences and glass for my mansion, but they weren't available. There aren't a lot of options for graphics, but it doesn't really seem that this game takes a whole dumptruck of RAM to run. People play this for a half hour and think ""This game sucks"". Well ya know what? This game came out pretty recently. It's going to update of course and they will be fixing bugs. This game gets updated quite often people! Don't let everyone make you believe a game is crap based on their experience playing it!			"

												definately worth the 5 bucks. ya, there may not be much, but the developer is still making updates to improve the game, and listening to fans. as it stands now, the game is decent. chatting is hard though since its very limited. in the settings, the graphicks go to loqwest to highest, orly effecting the render distance, so thats a bit annoying that i cant lower the overall graphics.      the sensitivity on mouse cant be lowered, so at first that annoyed the hell out of me, but i got an xbox cntroller, so used it. if you have been playing this on xbox and thinking the pc version is gonna be better, its absolutely not at the moment. no avatar custimization, no voice chat(unless using skype, team chat, ect.), less people playing(from my experience), and can be a bit boring sometimes. however, there is an update coming out that will fic graphics and mod support is being worked on, so the devs may turn this around.      if i knew that the pc version looked identical to the xbox version, to be honest, i would have just saved my money. however, if you dont have an xbox and you are willing to forgive its lack of custamizationin both the player models and settings, then you will not be dissapointed. since its a minecraft inspired game, you can build a base, house, or whatever, and still defent yourself against the zombie outbreak to see how long you can last.      i give this game a 5/10. i love the game, but as it stands, its an average game. with future updates, and new content, i see this game being a 6 or 7 out of 10. but if u have xbox and connected to the internet, please buy it there. same game basically, and mabye even better on the xbox depending on how well your pc can handle games.

												Honestly, a good game. It is obviously ""Inspired"" by minecraft, But it's fun. There are a few improvements that could be made that I will list now:* Different skins for variations of weapons (For example, Gold and diamond LMGs look the same.)* Don't spawn dragons too early, or nerf early dragons.* Better variations of enemies.
