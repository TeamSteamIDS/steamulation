												Master Reboot is a bit of an odd game. In both an obvious way and a non-obvious way. Essentially, the idea behind Master Reboot is that you are in a future where people can upload their memories, personality, and other traits into a cloud service, and then family and friends can visit these memories or download and install these peoples personalities into robotic shells to continue living with them if they desire. However, there was a crash in the system that caused the whole cloud service to have a reboot, which lost and corrupted some data. And now you play someone delving into the memories of someone with said corrupted data looking for something.It's basically a walking simulator experience game, except not in a typical sense. The game is split-up into memories, with each memory being a stage. They're called memories, but they're more like surreal dreams, with a lot of odd and abstract imagery and logic. Each memory also is different, and not just in themes, but with what you do. Some are literal walking simulators, but others have elements like puzzles, or things you have to avoid or sneak past or else you'll die.The stages have some good variety. Some are more relaxing, like this beach stage where you look for items with a metal detector. Others are a bit obtuse with what you must do, like this one amusement park stage you attend too. Some take on a horror tone, with creepy atmosphere and things trying to kill you.On that note, my favorite stage, and something that was legitimately scary, was the plane memory. With memories in the game like a hospital and school and graveyard, you'd think one of those would be the scariest stage (and they do have some creepy factor, to be sure), but the actual scariest stage was definitely the plane one. It scared me pretty bad a few times, and this is coming from someone who plays a lot of horror games.That's the thing I think this game does best. Atmosphere. I think the people who will enjoy this game the most are those who like atmosphere and maybe some oddities in their games. It was a bit longer than I was anticipating, but I did like it. Not the best thing I've ever played, but I liked the variety of tasks and settings, even if the basic concept of the game's story was more interesting than the story that develops in the game. But I'd say worth checking out if you're into this kind of thing.			"

...till death do us part.When you stop to dwell on those familiar words, it becomes evident that they apply not just to those we meet at the altar, but to our friends, family; all our relationships in life, that at some point must inevitably come to an end. But what if they didn't have to? What if there was a way to live on forever; to visit those who's bodies have long since fallen away, indefinitely, even after passing away ourselves. Thus is the idea behind the Soul Cloud, a device capable of recreating someone's personality, their likes and dislikes, and all of their memories in digital form where they can be visited by loved ones, and continue their life without the fear of death hanging over them...that is, until the server itself begins to die, and all those inhabiting it.Here lies the basic premise to Master Reboot, a wildly ambitious project from the small team at Wales Interactive, which places you inside the Soul Cloud at the point of its downfall as an unknown protagonist just as lost as you are admist its bizarre architecture and endless hallways. It's a game that is hard to categorize because from each moment to the next you are found doing something entirely different, though all in the attempt to discover who you are and what has happened to an invention hailed as one of the most important in recent memory.The narrative unfolds in a nonlinear, but structure format, with each memory you revisit giving you but a small piece of the overarching plot, until it finally falls into place and you're clued in on what all of it has been for. Unfortunately, that revelation falls a bit flat, switching gears at the last moment and leaving you with an empty sort of nothingness that doesn't sufficiently wrap up the myriad of lose ends that have been scattered before you during the course of the game. As the credits began to roll, I couldn't help but feel the developers had forgotten I was still expecting an ending, and had decided to simply go with the last minute plot device to close things off.Up until that point though the game is an entirely different beast, one that reinvents itself with each level giving you a new mechanic or puzzle to work with. The variety is great, and certainly welcome, but it also creates Master Reboot's biggest problem, its terrible inconsistency. Moment to moment it manages to reach both impressive heights and dreadful lows, fluctuating between the things that work and mechanics that never should have been in the game at all.This is most apparent when the developers attempt to juxtapose in horror elements which create aggravating instant kill scenarios that both break immersion, and are completely off from the emphasis on atmosphere and exploration that is found in most of the game. Along with these come arbitrary time limits that force you to continually replay segments, one off action sequences that aren't properly explained, and an abundance of odd elements that don't have time to be expanded upon into anything meaningful. I can appreciate all the ideas at play here, but find it hard to ignore how only about half of them actually work and fit within then game.Similarly, the ascetic is one of the game's biggest assets, with a creative and engaging art direction and some stunning lighting effects. It's a huge shame then that so much of the game is inside cramped, dark environments, with blurry textures and some truly horrific pop-in (even for a game running Unreal Engine 3). When you're taken out of the buildings and hallways, it's truly a sight to behold, but these moments are fleeting to the point I purposely stayed longer in them to appreciate how beautiful they are.Perhaps more aggravating than the discrepancies in the art design is the constant awkward cuts away from your perspective. Games like Bioshock and Half-Life proved that you can tell a great first-person story without the need to continually take control and the camera away from the player, so the fact Wales Interactive opted for such a graceless method of showcasing  important moments is frustrating, and greatly impacted my enjoyment. The off putting animated cutscenes that cap each memory were also an odd choice, feeling completely disconnected from the rest of the game even after you learn of the reason for them being there. Poor sound design is also disappointing, as the actual music and effects are quite good at immersing you in the experience, but were not even given a proper stereo directing to where everything sounds as if it's coming from the everywhere.It might sound as if I abhorred Master Reboot, but in truth I actually enjoyed it to give a cautious recommendation despite its flaws. It's a surreal adventure with big ideas, many of which it disappointingly can't pull off, but when it does is truly fantastic. Wales Interactive has the definite makings of a great indie developer, with a uniquely imaginative vision that could lead to something great down the road. It is certainly disappointing that they also inhabit the other end of the indie spectrum, with a significant lack of polish and numerous amateurish design choices. Master Reboot has some great moments, and some truly terrible ones, but in the end I was still happy to have played it and look forward to what will come out of the newly christened developer. Hopefully they will be able to learn from their mistakes, and build off the strong foundation here.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												I did not expect Master Reboot to be this good and interesting. The story is intriguing and mysterious, the gameplay is greatly varied, puzzles are intuitive and the visuals are quite something. Don't be disillusioned by the first 5-10 minutes of the game and check it ouf further, but don't expect a conventional game. I recommend playing it if you enjoy science fiction, puzzles and games that don't hold your hand.			"

												Master Reboot is a Sci-Fi First Person Exploration game, set in a virtual world dedicated to store dead people's memories and personalities, so that they're able to relieve their life, and also contact their family and friends, even after their unfortunate death.As you play, you'll uncover more about your past self and a bit about the world by visiting different memories.Sounds promising, right? Well, it certainly did!So, let's start with presentation. For me, the graphics were a mixed bag, to be honest. In the first level, you're greeted with amazing colors and lightning effects and just really polished graphics overall. While there are sparks of that throughout the rest of the game, it unfortunately falls a bit short of what it showed at the start.Texture work is almost inexistent at times, with a lot of the game beings mostly shaders and lights/shadows, and not a lot of details on textures, it's mostly just blurred colors.This makes the game look cheaper than it needed at times, specially since we had already seen a better work overall.On the other hand, the lighting effects are still awesome, and it's clearly a focus of the game's artstyle, specially inside the Hub World, with a very Neon feel to it.Besides, a really huge problem I had was with the brightness balance. This game is way too dark. Seriously, I wasn't able to see, at times (at the Hospital level, experimenting with the achievements). It was literally pitch black. I could change the brightness, BUT, you can't change the settings as you play, and the brightness meter isn't well calibrated, meaning that you can't really know when to stop. That's a bummer. I'll talk more about technical issues further.As I said, a mixed bag. Sometimes it looks awesome, other times it just feels rushed and cheap.Regarding music, though, I mostly enjoyed it. It has an eerie feel to it, but it's also beautiful, not just there to make you feel uncomfortable. Besides, it helps create an atmosphere in the several places you visit (i.e.: a circus).SoundEffects, on the other hand, felt a bit unbalanced (some of them genuinely bad), sometimes being too loud to the point of distorting the sounds. But, overall, they helped the atmosphere of the game.I think it has done its purpose, but overall, it could have been better.So, how's gameplay, one might ask?Well, this is where the game falls a bit too short. The game is mostly comprised of several areas (essentially 3 tiers that you unlock as you complete them), each with a certain memory. While there are bits of the game outside of memories, that's where most of the gameplay and exploration is set, so I'll focus on that.There's a hub area, in the virtual world, from which you can choose any of the areas of the available tier. These include place such as an Hospital, a Fairground, a Library, a Flight, and so on. You visit several places from your past life, trying to uncover exactly who you were, and who you were with.So far so good, I actually liked the structure of the game.In each area, it's more like a puzzle game. You'll have to explore the areas, and try to find out exactly what needs to be done. While you do that, there are little blue ducks, that give you pictures of a certain memory, a little piece of the puzzle of your past, if you will. These are usually fairly well hidden, and they're basically their reward for exploration. These areas, however, have two main problems. The first one, is that they're fairly small, rendering exploration a bit of a relative term, as there's not much to explore. Instead of exploring a big area, you're just looking under benches and the sort. Not very interesting.The second problem, is that most of the puzzles are fairly counter-intuitive, and have barely anything to do with your own purpose or memory. They're just... there. Acting as a hinderance more than a vehicle for the story. And that's unfortunate. They vary from too easy to random, for the most part. On their side though, is that they were certainly varied and SOME of them were pretty well thought and design. Unfortunately, the exception doesn't really make the rule.Most of the puzzles feel out of place and with solutions that aren't in any way tied to the memory.However, the areas weren't all just puzzles. They were actually very varied. The Hospital was more of a Horror-themed area, while the Flight was a stealthy mission. It certainly had more to it than I expected, but, the developers didn't seem either experienced or resourceful enough to do it all. The Stealth level was just frustrating at the beginning, but laughable once you figure out what to do. And the Horror level, somehow, managed to be less scary than other levels that were far more oppressive in a subtle way. In general, Master Reboot tried to hard to make a game out of the concept, and feeling a bit to shallow in that regard. I can understand why they've done it, but I think they only got sidestracked from the initial concept and ended up not doing either very well. One important aspect (for me, at least) is how they've done the achievements. Most of them are only there as an additional bit of challenge to the levels, but, once again, it doesn't add anything to the game. On the contrary, the way you're ""encouraged"" to play is actually less fun. On the Hospital level, for example, the achievements was to play without the Flashlight. ""Well, bring it on, then!""... Boy, did I regret it. It didn't make it scarier. It simply made it frustrating. In many corridors there was literally no light. It was pitch black. I didn't know where to go, and there weren't really any distant visual or audio cues. It was just a case of pressing WASD and hoping I wasn't going against the wall. It was... not a good experience, from a gameplay standpoint.The other achievements seem to follow the same rule, being more of a problem than a cool incentive to play the game in interesting ways.Alright, gameplay is out of the way. Now comes the really disappointing part for me. You know, as this was an Exploration game in such a promising world, I didn't care about gameplay too much. I was just expecting great encounters and insight into this future society. Maybe even questioning Death. But... it barely happened, unfortunately.This game seemed the perfect way of throwing some ideas at the player through the world itself, but it did none of that. It simply turned into a dramatic story about 2 random people who created the Soul Cloud... just because. No philosophy behind it was explained or even refered throughout the game. It was created in the same way as Facebook, which is disappointing, to say the least.The world was there, and you were in it, but you didn't really feel a part of it in any way. In the end of each area you get a cutscene about your previous life, but it's just a story about love and friendship with a murder thrown' in the middle to make it seem dark. It's just... shallow, forgeting the initial premise. Maybe I was expecting too much. Or just something different. And this game wasn't aiming for it.Well, maybe. But even in that case, looking back at the game, there's no reason for it to standout, aside from the pretty lighting. Gameplay is just there just to call it a game, as it wasn't the focus at all. The story was far more generic than it could have been with the endless possibilities of the Soul Cloud. The world was far too empty as well, with more focus on real world memories than the virtual world of the undead. All in all, this game is just a missed opportunity. It was set in a great world, full of very interesting concepts. But, it does nothing with it, trying to be too much at once, ending up missing most of its points.It has impressive lightning effects and great audio design, but as a game... there's nothing I can't think of to justify a recommendation.

												A beautiful, freaky first-person puzzle game that takes place in the virtual reality ""memory city"" of the protagonist, whose identity is obscured at first but ultimately emerges as the player explores various memory fragments.  What appears garbled and contradictory at first transforms into a pleasing, coherent story.The only story beat that annoyed was the use of the ""scary little girl"" cliché, but it's forgivable, largely due to the dynamics of the story itself.  In short, it makes sense.The game takes place over three acts, the meat of which is the second act, featuring twelve levels over three stages; within a stage, levels can be visited in any order and abandoned temporarily if a puzzle is too difficult at first.By and large the puzzles are easy to solve with a little persistence; often the trick is to simply find and figure out which objects in the world are puzzle pieces.  I did consult a walkthrough once for a challenge that appeared particularly nonsensical (at the end of the School level) - I sadly stand by that decision as the solution required previous memorization of an image not to be found in the puzzle area itself.  There were a few other puzzles that I didn't ""get"", but which were quickly solvable by ""brute force"" combination of available elements.  Also, there is a series in act three that will require the use of Steam's built-in screenshot function ... or fraps if you get the non-Steam version.  This was  irksome, but by contrast the great majority of levels are engaging and fun to figure out.My entire playthrough took just over five hours.  A short game, but it's all quality time.  If you aren't confronted with a puzzle, you are observing memories and piecing together the story of the central characters or running through the occasional action sequence.  These elements are well mixed with good pacing.  For the completionist, a couple extra hours might be had combing every level for the collectible memories.  I wish I had seen all of them, but I preferred to finish the game rather than essentially ""pixel hunt"" for every last story clue.  Personally, I dig short games.Overall, I unreservedly recommend Master Reboot.  It's worth a few hours of your time to find your way through this weird virtual world and resolve a compelling, sympathetic story.Also, duckies.			"

												I did not know what to expect when I entered the world of Master Reboot and the game delighted in surprising me around every turn. The way that the gameplay shifts depending on what memories you are reliving makes for a memorable experience and the creepy atmosphere will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you want to experience a game that is quite unlike anything else, do yourself a favor and check out Master Reboot.

												When I saw this game on the new releases page, the concept of the soul cloud, the soundtrack, and the art direction immediately caught my attention and got me to make a rare impule buy.  Featuring gorgeous art direction, great sound design, an interesting plot, and an atmosphere that can get really creepy at times for a game that isn't strictly a horror game.  It feels low budget and rough around the edges in places, but it's a great effort and a certain audience will absolutely love it.  There's some actiony gameplay in here and a little bit of platforming, but the playtime is dominated by puzzles which are typically engaging but simple.  Really, the puzzles are just a way to get you to explore the environment and the storyline and could have been cut without losing much.  The whole futuristic posthuman idea has always fascinated me, and I'd love to see a sequel that goes a little deeper into the world of the soul cloud.			"

												This game is going to be one of those hidden gems that when people find it and decide to play it, they will have wished they did so earlier.  Maybe that's why you're hear, reading these player reviews?I had no idea what to really expect when I first entered this game.  Once I got passed the introduction and into the main town where you access all the main memories, it hooks you in right away.  It pulls off a sort of donny darko mixed with tron sort of feel with visuals.  Do not underestimate the spookiness of this game, it will catch you off guard and make you screem like a school yard child.  Mix that in along with constantly needing to solve puzzels and uncovering story bit's here and there, you'll definately get your moneys worth.I highly recommend the game.  If you wanna see some game play before hand, check out parts of my playthrough https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBTSEGRKSinI2mHeAmyd493EnYAaBw94D  Just be warned, you might spoil parts of the game for yourself in doing so.

												Master Reboot had been in my backlog for several months but I finally took the time over the past few days to play through and even 100% the achievements.The game was not flawless by any means but to my mind the warts are just about what one should expect from such an ambitious indie project. Missing things like a key/controller config, multiple save slots (or a persistent way to view ducky and animated memories), borderless window, etc. are all minor quibbles that at worst I'd appreciate seeing in future projects.But the game so masterfully tells its story that the technical deficiencies don't really diminish my opinion of it, in the end. While there are no major plot twists or unexpected turns, the revelation of the plot as well as exposition on the settings and characters are all slowly dripped to the player in an epistolary style, primarily via documents and photos unlocked by finding the blue duckies in each level. The bits and pieces found reveal just enough to the player that unlocking a new one feels like satisfying detective work. Further, the setting and plot serve one another well and like all good sci-fi, they form a sort of feedback loop to make a greater whole than either aspect alone. The concept of the Soul Cloud and all of its implications are borne from the mundane human stories, and the regular lives of the characters are made extraordinary by the cyberpunk setup. Yes, cyberpunk. The game is set in a much nearer future than most cyberpunk sf but the concept of the Soul Cloud would be right at home in Ghost in the Shell - it's essentially one big shell for many many ghosts. The near-future setting helped rather than hindered my disbelief and I could believe that this sort of tech would exist in ""tomorrow's tomorrow"".The only criticism I might lodge at the plot and setting is that there's absolutely no falling action or an epilogue of any sorts, so the end feels just a bit abrupt. This very well could have been intentional as it leaves the player to consider what might happen next, and the ultimate outcome of a ""happy"" or ""sad"" ending depends on their own perspective and conclusions drawn. I understand a sequel is also in the works, which at this juncture I am quite looking forward to.A quick note about the audio/visual aspects, since I feel a review is incomplete without SOME words on that front. The flat-shaded, low-poly look was very effective in cooridination with the shader and lighting effects. I don't have much more to say on this front, but I mean- I took a couple of dozen screenshots (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Junon/screenshots/?appid=251850). The game looks good! As far as audio, I have even less to say here. The soundtrack is largely ambient and the sound effects did their job - I ran into no technical issues or points of aural annoyance.All told, Master Reboot is a diamond in the rough. I would heartily recommend it to anyone who can look around a few technical and gameplay frustrations to find an exceptional story. Games like Master Reboot are why I carry a torch for indies.			"

												I have to admit, I had no idea what to expect from this game and I was pleasantly surprised about it. The whole idea of being in the future where something like Soul Cloud which is storing dead people's memories and souls exists is very interesting. So what happened? Well, the Soul Cloud had crash which corrupted some data. And you have to restore some of them by looking into memories of somebody with said corrupted data. The whole game is split-up into a lot of levels, each one is representing some memory. So you can expect child memories, memories from school, flying, being on beach, everything you can imagine.But it's not a hippie game like you would expect from what I just wrote. I mean, few memories are nice and pleasant, but you will be surprised how scary some of them will turn. And I mean it when I say scary. This is what is this game good at. Atmosphere. Absolutely amazing atmosphere that will suck you into the game. Second good thing is its own art and design style. Music is well placed and everything fits together. The only thing I could reproach is that sometimes you can see that some objects are made pretty poorly. There are just few of them, it doesn't disrupt the game, but let's not pretend they aren't there. Overall the game looks just great. Oh, and I almost forgot! There are puzzles in some levels, but don't worry, if you're not into them. There aren't a lot of them and although they aren't extremely easy, you won't get stuck, I promise!So what is the summary? 9/10. I recommend this game to anybody who likes atmospheric games and horror ones even tho it's more chilly than scary - don't worry that you couldn't sleep at night. So that's it, stop reading this and go play it!			"

												This game is a first person adventure game, a true adventure game where your focus is on wandering environments and solving puzzles along a storyline, not like the ‘adventure’ classification some games like the Legend of Zelda are sometimes given.The game is set in a cyberworld/server where people that die have their memories preserved so that their loved ones can ‘visit’ them when they are gone. During the game you get the idea that things like the cyberworld weren’t common, so the memories you visit are relatively normal, like current 21st century experiences people might have as opposed to experiences in the transitioning cyberpunkesque world that the cyberworld exists in. However, the visuals in the game are just what you would expect from a game in the cyberpunk genre when not in the isolated memories. The visuals are relatively simple looking as far as being like crysis, but the style is appropriate for it and works well with the game. The sound in the game is pretty decent, but one of the added things that some may love or hate is that you constantly hear soft shouting or other horror tropes to give off a horror game atmosphere, even when you aren’t being chased by enemies or dangers that should actually give such a feeling.In the beginning you are stuck in a town of 'memories' in the cyberworld where you must experience groupings of memories ranging from school to childhood, although you start at childhood, so it reminded me like it was a reversal of the initial memories you go through in To the Moon, although you can choose to complete the memories in each grouped set out of order. As I said before, in each of these memories you must experience, you must find hidden objects and use them, solve puzzles, and avoid possible death as there are sometimes enemies that will confront you. Hidden in each of these memories are blue ducks that will give you some memorable info that adds to the game such as pictures of people the main character knew. I usually don’t collect unnecessary objects, but collecting these really adds to the story and narrative of the game, so gotta catchem all. Every time you complete a memory, you go to a post memory sequence which is usually somewhat unrelated to the memory where you have to solve a puzzle and/or do something under a time limit. Most of the puzzles aren’t too hard, but sometimes it won’t be obvious what to do.Overall, I found Master Reboot to be a fun game, and if nothing else, its probably one of the few games on steam with the Welsh language option.

												Wow.What should I say about this game?I had been interested in it from the moment I had seen it on Steam nearly a year ago. What had kept me from purchasing it right away was the horror aspect, but that definitely added to the game, rather than detracted from it. I am absolutely glad that I bought and played this game through, and definitely plan on playing through again to unlock the alternate ending.Master Reboot delivers an artistic experience with a story to match that leaves you eager to play each section and find every secret. This game will leave you wanting to play more of it even after finishing it. Step into the Soul Cloud yourself and learn about the Mysteri Corporation and those involved in it's origins.Some of the ""horror"" aspects of the game are predictable, but still managed to frighten me. Besides that the story is constantly compelling and the voice acting is well done. I would rate the game a solid 9 out of 10.			"

												This game looked so promising but the execution falls short and ruins the experience. Controls are clunky and the game demands a certain rate of precision, this goes for both mouse / keybaord and controller. It's sometimes unclear what to do and the game offers no help most of the time. Not possible to check keybinds once ingame, so you'd best not forget them. Lastly, I discovered a point where if you click too fast, the whole game crashes to desktop, yet you can only get past the obstacle by clicking fast enough. I know it's called Master Reboot but when I had to restart the game multiple times due to this happening, it turned out quite ironic. It's a shame, because the story is good. I could even have forgiven the childish art and basic 3D graphics had the rest of the game been better. But now it just feels like quality control was skimped on entirely. Not sure why there are so many positive reviews, perhaps people hold back because it's a small studio? Anyway, since I could no longer get a refunds, I decided to give it a go and get the achievements, hoping my mind would get swayed at one point. Alas, it didn't, so unless you want to see for yourself I would not recommend you buy this game. Unless the devs further patch it, which seems unlikely at this point.			"

												I rarely write reviews, but I feel, that I have to write for this game one. I can't believe the 59/100 Metacritic rating, because this game is a masterpiece, BUT not for 14$, which is actually EUR here. The game sure looks a bit outdated, but it's moral question is a thing, which is worth thinking on. So basically we are playing as an unknown girl, who has to relive a person's memories. The connections will be revealed later in the game, and damn, the story is awesome! Each memory is a little puzzle, but unfortunately a very basic one. Each memory consists of two levels. A real memory level, where you relive the person's memory, sometimes interrupted by Seren, and a Zero level. Zero levels are really twisted maps. They aren't the person's memories, but something different. Okay, okay, but you may ask, who the hell is Seren? Well Seren is the character, who gives a little bit of horror to the game. Don't worry, the game isn't a fully horror one, but some levels give me chills on my back, when I play them. Seren's appearance is really cliché, because mostly she can't hurt you (á la F.E.A.R.), and if there is a dark hallway, you can expect her appearance. I think she can only hurt you in 2 levels, but I'm not so sure. If I were a Journalist I'd give the game an 85/100. Why? Because it's really unique. I've never seen any game like this before, and thanks to this game, I will buy Soul Axiom too. Master Reboot is kind of a visual novel in first person view, and a really well-written one. So I'd suggest EVERYONE to pick it up, when it's on Sale (like right now). For 3.50$ / EUR it's a short, but amazing game!P.s:: If a developer sees this, can you tell me, where should I know the ""password"" in the library memory? I just saw videos, that people are solving it without a problem, but they didn't told the reason, why that is the solution. You know the red, green, blue light puzzle :D			"

Note: I got paid to write for reviews4views website.Reboot is a first person puzzle game that has a focus on the philosophy of what makes the “self” or “soul”. The self is apparently a collection of ducks that form your memory by that aside… the impending question over the playthrough is what defines us, and could it be possible to clone ourselves in a way so that we are exactly the same without losing something beyond our memories. You play as a female protagonist piecing together the puzzles of both the story and environments she has to explore within Soul Chamber. Hub - Memory replayability +Central Hub to play memories again and unlock other ones+Lights show status of the doors (open/complete/closed)-No backtracking once you reach the final level (train)-No extras in main menu to visit memories you unlockedThere is a central hub with doors that lead to certain areas marked with images for the theme. Hospitals, schools, highways, and other themes have all their own puzzles and elements of the story to present to you. You are required to do a set amount of puzzles before the other doors will unlock for you. The doors themselves have light indicators to tell you the status of them, along with bookstands in front of them that allow you to revisit memories. Bookstands outside door shows all info you collected from ducksAtmosphere+Nice Atmosphere and art style-Sound quality could be betterThe atmosphere is very eerie with a general feel of isolation from the world. There is just as many environments as there are puzzles. The environments allow you to freely explore to a degree but the area of which you can do so is very small with linear segments. The areas tend to have their own way of artistically showing you hints, from symbols in graveyards to color coded pieces scattered amongst the playground. There are even segments where you have to listen closely to sounds and repeat them in order to proceed though many deem this the most annoying part of the game.Puzzles - Interaction+Great puzzle diversity (sounds,cryptic,etc)-Difficulty InconsistencyThe puzzle diversity in this game ranges from replicating sounds, pictures and figuring out how to navigate through mazes to deciphering symbols, messages, and images.  There are some places where you can do them out of order which tends to lead to inconsistent difficulty, most notably near the end of the game there is 4 puzzles that are simply varying difficulties of the same exact puzzle.Story+Fun Theory Crafting-Unsatisfactory Ending The ducks (memories) give you hints and glimpses into the memory of your character and the events that have unfold. It is fun making a theory of what occurred as the story unfolds from scenario to scenario until the end of the game though due to lack of backtracking its rather hard to revisit the memories you spent time finding and uncovering. The ending however leaves rather open-ended to speculate to what really happened to your character.ConclusionOverall, I would say master reboot is a good game for not only for theorycrafting but for the variety of puzzles that makes the experience kept fresh throughout the game. The main complaints I have is that the rushing I did to collect all the ducks (information) made me incapable of backtracking to look through it all. I plan to play the game a second time and take as much time playing the memories as I do the puzzles in order to get the most enjoyment out of the game possible.Important Note: Got paid to do this review by reviews4views			"

												A huge dissapointment.  The story was thin.  Almost all of the gameplay was ""wander around and poke at things until something happens"".  There were a lot of cheap jump scares that quickly turn into annoyances.  And to top it all off: timed jumping puzzles.  Really.  I wish I hadn't wasted my time.			"

												Master Reboot is one of those games that was not quite what I expected.  I figured I would be playing a tightly plotted sci-horror adventure through the metaphysical realm of someone's digitized mind.  Instead, the game is a far more loosely structured affair, leaving much of the plot and the significance of its setpieces shrouded in mystery and up to the player to figure out on their own.  While it's not what I was expecting, I'd be lying if I didn't say it was still quite good.As seems to be a trend in my recent game choices, Master Reboot may be played from the first person, but it is very much in the same thread as the point-and-click adventures of old.  The bulk of the meat the game has to offer comes not in the game's mechanics, but in the information and secrets uncovered as the player progresses through it.  Very little of the game requires fast-twitch reflexes or quick aiming under pressure, though there are a few sequences which will test that.  Overall though, this game is more about piecing together a story.The somewhat rudimentary graphics might be a stumbling point for other games, but in Master Reboot it helps set the tone wonderfully, a constant reminder that you are in the digital world, not the physical world.  Even the game's 2d animated memory sequences are explained in game as a limitation of the system, which is a somewhat obvious excuse but a wonderfully executed one all the same.  The impact of the story is not overly dulled by either, and in some cases it makes the experience hit that much harder.Tone-wise, the game rests firmly in the sci-horror camp throughout, with variations in how effective the horror side of it is.  Some of the individual areas are tonally perfect, setting a low background tone of unease and general mistrust of the reality you occupy.  One area in particular presents with strange sparse, generic, unrealistic architecture over a landscape of water, fading into the distance under torrential virtual reality rain, but it's not until you are sent flying from platform to platform that you realize that the water is rising impossibly fast for as far as you can see, and if you don't move quickly it will cover you too.  It's moments like these that Master Reboot delivers.Other levels do not fare so well, unfortunately, particularly those which rely heavily on jump scares and other such tricks, which may work for a few moments but largely fall flat.  Jump scares in particuar are a bit overused in this game for some things; a ghostly blur running across your vision quickly while a slam sounds in the distance might be spooky at first, but when it happens every single time you come to a specific area in the level it just gets boring and old.The takeaway I got from Master Reboot was largely bittersweet but satisfying.  Without spoiling anything, the endings (yes there are multiple) are neither purely happy nor purely sad.  Each is somewhat appropriate for the underlying tragic plot behind the events of the game, though still not as satisfying as they perhaps could have been, in part because the minimalist narrative-free delivery that worked so well for the backstory does not work as well for the ending.Ultimately, I got my money's worth from the game.  It presents gameplay wrapped in tantalizing hints that promise an interesting and unique story, then delivers.			"

												This was a nice surprise! I did not even read carefully the description....I thought the game was something completely different....some sort of sci-fi exploration game  with a slow pace (my bad) but it's not.The game is in 1st person view, it uses Unreal Engine 3 and will last about 4 or 5 hours. It is mostly about exploration, with some puzzles and few platforming fast sections.You begin without knowing anything about yourself, or where you are. There is very little voice acting, you can understand the story only if you carefully find the pieces of lore scattered around the levels (not hard to find at all, and that is good).Slowly you can put pieces together and understand what is happening. The story is quite nice and I like the narration more than the story and realization of the game.Some levels are really well done, and it was also quite scary for me (some levels I had to play them without sounds). I am very sensitive when it comes to horror games....I am often scared of my own shadow. Horror elements: there are cheap jumpscare elements but there are also some nice touches. Definitely this game is not about being horror obviously.Once I began playing, I could not stop, mostly because I had not such high expectations for the game and was definitely surprised. For sure there are much worse walking simulators out there.			"

												First off I have to say I really enjoyed this game.It's  colourful, the music is eery but well placed. There are a few good jumps - one in particular I didn't see coming so it made it extra special. The story is interesting, and not to hard to follow. Controls are typical FPS and are smooth. (I tried Controller at first but they seemed too slow so recommend keyboard and mouse)I'm a little puzzled by the metacritic reviews. Clearly those reviewers never gave this game a chance. Overall I recommend this easily to anyone that likes a good story, combined with some (not to hard) puzzles, in First person. Oh and if you like Rubber Duckies.  "

												After having been curious about this game for a good while now, I finally gave in to finally trying it out and playing it through. Having just completed the game, I'm happy that I did end up getting this game and playing it. A couple hours well spent. The game carries with it a creepy ambiance, wide range of good puzzles, excellent story, and more. When it comes to visuals, everyone has their own cup of tea. Personally, I was a fan of this game's visual style and found it rather beautiful and to suit the game as well. The same goes for the game's soundtrack as well. I thought it was nice, and at times, suited that horror/creepy theme to the game. With the story, it can be a bit confusing, but if you collect the ducks thoughout the game, which provide further backstory and such, and once you piece it together, makes sense and doesn't leave too many questions open. After piecing together the story and thinking back on the game, I thought it to be good. Again, not a game for everyone, but it's a game I enjoyed and personally, I thought it was a good game. Glad I bought and played it!			"

												A very ambitious spooky puzzle game. The game consists mostly of solving puzzles in each room to escape, and collecting information to piece together the cyberpunk story. There are a lot of memorable moments and interesting surreal locations. The game is held back by some clunky movement and a couple of obtuse puzzles. Additionally, it features a lot of cheap webcomic level cartoons tellling some of the story. It's not exactly a masterpiece, but I think it's worth checking out if you are interested in these kinds of games.			"

												This game has a somewhat appealing in-game visual style and an interesting concept for the story. Unfortunatley that's all the positive things I have to say about the game. This game would be better off having gameplay similar to Dear Ester because the puzzles are some of the most simplistic and badly designed puzzles I have ever seen. As a toddler did you ever have the toy were you have to fit certian shapes in the right holes? That's the most complicated the games puzzles will get.  On top of that some of the puzzles make absolutley no sense. Heres an example:During the park memories there is a yellow traingle trapped under a jungle gym with no way to retrieve it. How do you think you solve this? Dig under it? Pry the jungle gym open? Nope. There is a triangle shape on the outskirts of the level that you are supposed to fill with a triangle block that is also on near the borders of the level. This items are a decent distance away from the puzzles themselves which in itself makes little sense. So how does placing the yellow triangle in the yellow hole solve the puzzle you ask? It causes a crow on a nearby branch to squawk and the jungle gym blows up.  The game may have simplistic puzzles by concept but they are made difficult for the player to solve through terrible design. Here is a description of another puzzle:The first sequence of the airplane memory has you collecting three key cards that open a door and allow you to proceed. Seems easy right?  The keys are in various different rows of seats in the airplane that all look identical. While looking for the cards an enemy will spawn at the end of the level walking in a straight line towards you. There is no way to avoid this enemy without opening the door so you end up rushing (I would say frantically but that would imply the situation was even remotely scary.) to find the key cards in 30 identical looking seats while the girl comes closer to you down the aisle. It ends up just being a game of constantly respawning while memorizing where the last keycard you found was.  You may think I'm cherrypicking here but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Every puzzle so far has either been extrememly simple or also confusing and illogical even in the world of the game. The game also has a deviant art tier artstyle that makes up the cutscenes and clash extremely with the decent in game graphics. It has horror elements too but they couldn't even scare a skittish cat. Do I recommend this at full price? No   On sale? Can you stomach crap puzzles for a decent story? If so then yes.			"

												What can I say about this game?It's all about the story. The game has a very potent and compelling story, that drops inklings along the way, unfolding in clues and in your mind as you piece it all together. If one thing sold me on this game, it was that story.The artstyle is interesting - while not the most polished, it is still very alluring and beautiful, landscapes and scenery feel sprawling and endless, and you feel like you could walk forever in a memory (game-sense literally) till you hit the digital perimeter that reminds you that you are in a digital world. It does an excellent job conveying a sense of the surreal, and while not perfect, is more than sufficient.I could see where elements within the game (as well as moments) tie it to horror, though I would define horror as much more, this game certainly had it's moments that startled me, which I did not forsee being a thing, and to be surprised in that way is always a good thing, feels refreshing and not a rehash of ""seen-it-coming""s, though towards the last quarter of the game these moments become more of an annoyance than a genuine disturbance. I would have liked to have seen more of the type of scares you get in the early game, around the late game.Very little choice, so to call this an exploration game would be inaccurate. The game probably closest fits ""Adventure"" and ""Puzzle-solving"" in the Myst-type (showing my age) sense, I suppose but I feel that it doesn't exactly take away from what the game is aiming to offer.And what it is offering is a story. Hands down the #1 reason to play this game. I'm sure you've seen variations of this story elsewhere in other media, but that's likely because it is such an intriguing concept and one that I feel cannot be explored enough so I welcome this game and anything else that shares in the theme.I vote you play it. Screen shot it, film a ""Let's Play!"", discuss the ideas the game broaches with others and build on them and expand your mind to something almost otherworldly that is yet still a possibility someday for us.Lastly, just get it because you'll enjoy it and you'll be supporting the Devs and also I love you.

												This game can't make up its mind on what it wants to be. Part survival horror, part exploration, part...mini games? The problem is that it doesn't do any of them very well, and on the larger levels the slow plodding along of your character is just frustratingly slow. The survival horror parts quickly lose their luster when you figure out that sounds are scripted at certain locations and can be repeated over and over, or that you can meander along in one of the few ""chase"" scenes without actually having any worry of being caught.The story is largely told through finding rubber duckies scattered throughout memories. Some of these, the important ones, thankfully, are easy to find with the briefest bit of looking around. Others are incredibly frustrating due to nearly pixel-perfect jumps and long backtracking times. The end of each memory also has a brief animation revealing some storyline, and I honestly have nothing complimentary to say about them.The story itself is rather poorly told, with many of the important plot points feeling forced, and much of the rest of it as completely unrealistic. As an example, being inside the ""Soul cloud"" for more than a certain time causes your physical body to die, and you become trapped there. You find a company memo stating how they've lost several employees to this, and I can't help but wonder how the company hasn't been sued out of existence.There are some interesting bits scattered here and there, but unfortunately that's all there is - interesting bits. The gameplay is dull for the most part, the puzzles simple, the mini games frustrating or unfun at best, the horror isn't frightening - basically, they tried for everything and succeeded at nothing.

												This game is definitely something interesting.The premise is very interesting, with an online cloud-system where dead people's memories are stored, and the story is also very intriquing, as you uncover more of your memories and figure out not only what is going on, but also who your player-character is.The art-style during gameplay is very visually pleasing and fits the game well, and while it's quite obvious that the drawn cutscenes aren't very proffesional, they do the job of telling a good story.The sound design is also really great, as the songs in the background and the various sound effects that appear really make the atmosphere, and as the game is a lot about atmosphere, the art-style and the sound design deliever perfectly.Not to mention, the ending credits-song is really good. It is a great song to end the game with.The gameplay is also quite fun, as you do different puzzles, and while there are some puzzles that can be quite frustrating to figure out, most of the puzzles are quite fun to figure out.Seren.exe, the creepy girl-character that follows you, is at first quite creepy and I definitely got a shock when I first enqountered her, and she definitely fits the creepy atmosphere. However, as the game goes on, her presence can be quickly discovered by the players, and when she isn't killing, but just staring at you creepily, her effectiveness becomes a lot less scary, as I definitely made some jokes in my head about her just standing in the corner not doing anything.Overall, a worthwhile game that has a interesting premise and some great atmosphere. It is quite short, but if you like this sort of game, you'll probably get your money worth.			"

												It's alright. I porbably would have liked the story more if I could understand it, the sound was low and distorted (not due to glitches, on purpose) and I couldn't maek out any of the speech in some very important scenes. It's some kind of horror, but not particularly scary horror. Not quite psychological either. I can't pin down what it is but it was engaging enough for me to sit down and play it all the way through. It's a very short game, might take you 2-3 hours to beat. The puzzles are all EXTREMELY simplistic, most of the time you'll just be going through the motions to find out little tidbits of story told through photograps, notes, emails, and satanic glyphs on the wall, all presented ""Gone Home"" style... but with ducks. The game has a strange fixation with ducks. I don't know what it means, some kind of in-joke with the developers, maybe. The game explains it as some sort of device for people in a simulation to store data in, but why ducks? There are plenty of conspicuous cubes laying around, why not those?This game is one hell of a mixed bag. Maybe it wasn't for me, but lots of people seem to really love it and it was alright. It's not super expensive either, so really the only way to find out if it's for you is to give it a shot.			"

												I'm stuck on the final boss and completely frustrated, but I still can't say that I don't recommend this game.  It's that damn partial controller support that plagues me.  My d-input controllers have permanent button inversion and my xbox controller auto sidesteps making the random platform elements borderline impossible.  If there was an ingame option screen I could probably just switch to keyboard and mouse (I need to invert the mouse) but no, I have to start the whole level over again.  Anyways:Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=lovedGame design: 4/5 The game itself is pretty simple.  Run round in the dark and find clues to the story.  It mixes elements of survival horror (I wouldn't call this an exclusively survival horror game though, very little can actually hurt you), puzzles, platforming, hidden object.  It's actually a good mix, and despite my beef with the platforming, the game itself doesn't feel broken.  Perhaps a bit dated.  3D navigation is a bit clunky, and some of the puzzles don't make any sense (but are still easy), but none of it actually gets in the way of gameplay.  Maybe you could call this game ""casual horror""?Tone: 3/5   The largest problem with the game is it's selection of advertised screenshots.  It has some cool and haunting imagery, but like the game play, there ir a mix of styles present.  There are weird little cutscenes at the end of each level that look like they were made in Flash.  The impression of the game is a bit different than what is actually there, granted that it is difficult to present a game with this much variety.  It simply might not be the epic horror mystery that you are looking for.  The concept is great, but the story is overly simple and a bit confusing.  I don't know if the game intends to keep you guessing about which girl is which, but I'm still getting them mixed up.  I can nitpick more but ultimately it doesn't interfere with the experience that much.  I really want to enforce that this game is actually quite casual, don't expect anything mindblowing and you should enjoy it.Personal skew: 2/5 I'm not mad anymore, and might attempt that last level again.  Hardcore gamers will find this game easy and possibly laughable, I don't think that most will feel it to be a waste of time, but some definitely will.  Casual gamers will get the most out of this, especially if you're interested in horror games but don't want to be overwhelmed.			"

												I rarely write reviews, but this game deserves it.Master Reboot is a hybrid masterpiece combining elements of adventure, horror and mystery games.Considering it's an indie game i'd say the devs put alot of effort in this game and makes me think what they could develop with more budget.Oh, wait! I can see that on their new game ""Soul Axiom"" which sets the surreal environment and awesomeness of the game on a whole new level. Also the graphics match those of an AAA game. But enough with that, this is a review about Master Reboot!This game has an immense storyline which you have lots of things to explore if you like giving attention to details.You might be confused or feeling lost at first but giving attention to the cutscenes and clues found, you will feel like you're reading a very well written book. If you're looking for a casual game and not like paying attention this game is probably not for you, you will not understand anything about the story.Everything makes sense eventually and oh, its goooood.The environment of this game is awesome, most sceneries are surreal and the ambient sounds make the mystery atmosphere even better.Most of the puzzles are great, actually I believe it's the way puzzles in games are supposed to be these days. Some of them are too easy, but most of them are clever and you can complete them pretty fast once you get them.This game is about exploring, solving puzzles,finding items and how to use the and avoiding dangers. You won't be finding yourself shooting at stuff  Well, unless some fake ducks with a fake gun Also, this game has several scenes that might make your heart beat quite faster, so i wouldn't suggest this to the weak hearted.If you like indie and/or horror/mystery/atmospheric games , this is one of the best games I could suggest. Actually it's the best, because the devs are awesome. They always pay attention to the community and care about what we want. Also from personal experience I had a problem with my steam key and they helped me almost instantly after I mailed them, with a very polite and friendly way. Cheers to the devs.Last but certainly not least,  The ending song is awesome! Seriously, if you re a bit emotional it could give you tears. So.. synopis: ✔ Mystery/horror atmosphere ✔ Immense, well written storyline (that however requires for you to explore, you wont get it only from cutscenes) ✔ Great graphics for an indie game ✔ Very well optimised  ✔ Awesome devs ✔  AWESOME ending song!

												Maybe it's simply because I really love sci-fi stories that I give a perfect note for this game, but you cannot find a similar game anywhere ... I'm not saying the game is better than System Shock 2, but it's certainly there breathing on its shoulders.The story about downloading someone's memory/counsciousness inside a virtual world may seem farfetched for some, but if you look into it a bit (Intiative 2045, Google Deep Mind) we might be getting there sooner than we think.I guess it can't hurt to explore what we might experience in the event that this becomes a reality.

												This game....is simply amazing. It's creepy through sheer atmosphere, and no actual hard 'scares'...The 'story' starts with you knowing jack all, the puzzles are interesting, fun, challenging but not overly so, and the ending really touches on some basic human emotions and questions about life and reality.It's a bit of a short game, but sometimes, that's not a bad thing. I recommend it.And if it goes on sale extra cheap? Definitely do not miss it.			"

												tl;dr - I picked this up during a sale because the description seemed neat and it fulfilled my expectations. The style was fantastic, the story was pretty nifty, the gameplay and puzzles were good but not great. Worth.Took about 3-4 hours to complete, and I'm a pretty slow gamer. Plan on another playthrough for achievements.The world you're thrown into is queer and rather unsettling. You're never really directly told the plot in game, instead you're left to piece it together through notes you find (blue duckies) and scenes during memories (the puzzle/exploration stages to progress the game). I honestly got scared a few times, but I'm an incredibly big wuss so that doesn't say much.The puzzles range from really simple, to somewhat abstract. I remember one frustrating part I couldn't pass (plane memory) that I looked up because I really just couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. There are a couple situations that are more ""platform"" like but generally you're just walking around figuring stuff out/not peeing your pants avoiding Seren.I really loved the art style. Chunky, blocky shapes and contrasting colors. Vaguely reminded me of Mirror's Edge. The music/sounds really help sell the mood. Watching the main hub get filled up with stuff from the memories was cool too.Definitely worth a try.			"

												Obviously I would not buy a game if I didn't think I was going to enjoy it but some times you hit upon a game like this that far exceeds your expectations. The stylised graphics and soundtrack work together to create an awesome creepy atmosphere. The gameplay is mostly simple yet extremely satisfying puzzles with a few other bits and pieces thrown in here and there for variety. The story is great and hidden throughout the levels are more bits of information, this way of feeding you the plot bit by bit and allowing you to piece it all together is very engaging. I have two minor complaints. The first play through only took about 4 hours and it left me wanting more. The second complaint is musical puzzles; I am tone deaf and these puzzles were pretty much impossible for me. Regardless of that I can heartily recommend this game.			"

												At full price, Master Reboot is not worth it. One problem is that it's rather short (less than four hours to finish it).While the simplicity of the graphics could be excused by the theme, they do not just *appear* simple but *are* simple. That's the difference to Tron 2.0 from 2003: Master Reboot wouldn't have looked good even back then. Had they been more stylized, the game might've looked better.The game is never about fighting enemies but running away from them, a bit similar to Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. The weapons the player on occasion have are not used for shooting enemies.Beside hiding from the (scripted) enemy behaviour, the game has a number of puzzles. Unfortunately, a number of them felt nonsensical.And why include first-person platforming? Tron 2.0 should've already taught that it's a bad idea.Bottom line:+ interesting plot+ interesting setting- platforming- some poorly designed puzzles (e.g., the beach)- overly simple and poor graphics.Worth trying, but not at the full price.

			Views: 97		

			Master Reboot is a puzzle game with great atmosphere and a underline horror spook feeling. Available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/251850/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is...		

Master Reboot is a puzzle style game where the world is broken up into sections and each section you must fix what is wrong. The game tells a solid, if not slightly confusing story. I never found the puzzles to be too hard, some require wit others book smarts. Their is a underline horror theme to the game, but not one that is out to hunt and kill you, mostly. The atmosphere gets under your skin and the graphic quality of the game is decent. The art style is great, but many of the textures in the game are lacking. Biggest issue with the game is that there is no FOV slider, so the game may end up being too much for some due to nauseous feelings after playing. It a simply game wrapped up in a wonderful world and one to look into for sure.			"

IntroductionMaster Reboot is an immersive, story-centric indie game by Wales Interactive.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a game with a good story, a bit of mystery, problem/puzzle solving, and a dash of horror elements.You play Madison Jones.  A gifted mathematician, programmer, CEO of Mysteri Corporation, and archtitect of the ""Soul Cloud"".  The Soul Cloud is a digital repository of human memories that is ostensibly set up for people to be able to interact with a digital replica of their loved ones.  However, something is amiss and you must figure out what is wrong with the Soul Cloud while uncovering the backstory and motivation of your character.Pros Spectacular Use of Lighting Creepy Soundtrack Good Story Good Writing MemorableCons The 2D ""memory"" cutscenes look pretty cheesy Weird models for the player character's hands, axe, and air-rifle (floating guns like its 1999 again) Relatively short (8-12 hours)SummaryI enjoyed and I recommend this game.  Some people will undoubtedly be put off by the graphics, but I would consider this game a testiment to the power of storytelling over eye-candy.  There were a few startling elements that elicited involuntary vocal expletives of surprise; so take that into consideration.  This isn't going to be a Game of the Year, but I put it in the same category as Gone Home--a must-play, cerebral, story-driven game that will stick with you.			"

												Dear God, I played this whole game with an xbox controller.  I must be out of my mind.  It keeps moving to the left or forward ALL THE TIME.  I even changed controllers and got the same issue.  That said, I lowered my head and decided I will finish this game without a mouse - or at least 95% without a mouse. Why?  Originally because I tend to game from my mediorce HTPC in my bedroom on my bed.  Then, it became a fully motivated goal to me - I MUST DO THIS.  I CAN BEAT IT WITH WONKY CONTOLS. I CAN!  Keep in mind i am *not* a very good gamer nor am I fast.  Just determined.I was doing okay until the airplane level.  Oh man.  Needs a KB & mouse, Needs a KB & mouse.   Had to play with both while jumping between controller and keyboard because i wanted to finish with the controller as much as possible.  Then it was not terrible.  I mean, I'd start levels immediately walking into walls with my hands OFF the controller but okay.   I can do this.  Just keep starting and stopping ....over and over. Jumping back all the time.  No sweat.Then, comes the light maze in the dark. AAWRHRRHGHGHGHRH.  That probably added an extra hour or two to the gameplay.Just walking to edges as well as  can, only for the controller to suddenly start sidestepping to the right and fall off.  That happened so much.  Got really good at stopping. and falling. But made it through.Lastly, the end level.  C'mon 3 minutes to finish all that?????  I could get everything just fine - 4 of those puzzles no big deal.The platforming one??? On a controller that moves like a marbles on a plate?  Took me about 4 hrs.  Always, finishing all the easy puzzles and then stuck on platforming till the clock ran out.  When I actually completed that last level - with 30 secs to go mind you -  I don't think I've felt an accomplishment like that in quite a long long time.  It's no picnic on KB & Mouse, but to know that i did on my xbox controller give me so much pleasure.  Like finishing a super hard college course final.On to the game .  Really, everybody has said everything on this already.  It's enimatic and throws you in unexplained.  There are parts that kind of stick with you and a few puzzles where I said "" Oh! Really? That's it?? Did I solve that by accident?"" .  And there are quite a few of "" Oh no. no. no. no.  Not like that.  Don't do that.  That's just mean.""  Yes, there are some scary bits but it's not really terrifying.  The original ideas and gameplay kept me going quite a bit.  But it was the challenge of the controller scheme that made me finish it really.  I wanted to beat it my way. And I did.  Game was good too.   My next will be point and click, honest.			"

												I can't like this game.It's clunky as hell, The interface is really frustrating and the action elements are just unbearable. I was halfway through the game and these are what made me quit, with the occasional crash to desktop.it's graphically bland. I am aware indies have limited resources, and I like good art direction more than technically impressive graphics. Either way, I am not impressed.There are no subtitles. No game should ever release with voice clips but without subtitles, at least in the original language. No excuse for this one.The story was the only thing that was keeping me from quitting (until a point). It sounds like it could be interesting, just not enough to keep me going through all the rest.

												Master Reboot is one of those games with an interesting idea but a poor execution due to a lack of narrative and context. If you're a completionist and happen to find all the rubber ducks, you'll understand the context, but outside of that, this game will only confuse more with its rather poor excusues.Basically (and you don't find this out until the end of the game, but I'm also trying to save you money) you play some chick named Madison who invented the ""Soul Cloud"" with a dude named David or something, I actually already forgot. Anyway, they invent the soul cloud under this company named Mysteri in the year 2026 where technology is supposedly going to be futuristic just like how it was in George Orwell's 1984. Anway, the whole game takes place in the soul cloud where users can place their memories and re-experience them for a limited amount of time. At least that's what I took away from it. This guy David is murdered by someone named Astrid, I never caught the relationship between Astrid and Madison, but I believe they knew each other. Also, Astrid had died four years prior but was brought back to life; don't understand how that works, but alright I'll let it slide. So Madison is in the soul cloud because of some virus that is shown to have been sent to Madison from an anonymous user, the virus basically effed up the cloud, the virus being named a bunch of random letters and numbers.exe. Madison, being so tech smart inventing some crazy idea, opens the virus which infiltrates the clouds servers, deleting people's data. A bunch of stupid people are mad as shown in ""tweet"" like this one, ""i haet teh sole cloude"". Yeah, that's right, people in the future are still terrible at spelling.So that's basically the story, the gameplay involves you, Madison, navigating your own memories just to get to the virus. Basically, the giant library room that becomes this platforming nightmare has the virus which is really just a digital and angry Astrid that you've probably seen throughout the game acting like Alma from the FEAR games. The memories range from your childhood to your romantic feelings with David, rather generic to be honest. Also, the game is supposed to be a sort of horror game, but the jump scares were laughable. I feel like there was supposed to be emotion with the memories, but the emotion was detached due to the lack of narrative mentioned earlier. The Stanley Parable had more emotion.The graphics were toon shaded without the black edges which were explained in game due to the soul cloud being in the early stages. As George Carlin would say, ""Bull-sh!t"", the toon shading is a cop out, especially when it doesn't even look good. I mean, at least Gearbox makes Borderlands look awesome. This was rubbish. It doesn't help when the devs make an excuse of in game graphics being toon shaded and then the actual memories are 2D flash animated or puppet pinned from After Effects. You'd think that the memories themselves would be detailed 3D considering that they're taken from the human's mind? Think of the film Final Cut starring the late, great Robin Williams. The memories that he works with are fully realized and completely real, in the flesh. The 2D is such a cop out, what rubbish.The music and sounds were the only good thing, as they were both evidently creepier than the game itself. And even then, the sounds had some weird mixing.4.0/10			"

												Now, I got this for five dollars and that is in the end what it feels like it should be priced at. The polish is not there, the ideas are sometimes half-baked, but overall this is a fun game, at the right price. I found it to be a lot like something David Lynch might have done back in the eighties, around the time of Dune. The game does not hold your hand and instead let's you solve most things on your own, there are clues from time to time. Sometimes the path is so obvious it feels rushed and other times it is so obscure it becomes frustrating. The visual style is something I enjoyed when the textures were not so muddy, it made me wonder why it wasn't polished more. I am not certain how big the team was behind this game, but I have seen a team of four put out something far better looking than this. Now, the lighting is well implemented, but the over all look of the game comes across as rushed. There are levels that seem forced due to how they rendered the environment, it looks like some student project out of Unity from time to time. This really takes away from the real well done segments, that seem to set you up for a great experience, just to let you down again. The music is fantastic, being the real strongpoint of the game. I'm surprised it was not used more often, especially during the art cut scenes, that turn out to be sloppy due to a lack of music. Over all the animations are good enough to not make you feel ripped off, but I could not expect you to get fifteen dollars worth of gameplay out of this. For the five I paid, I am  very happy with the game and it would be so much greater if he price was less. All in all, this is a game I enjoyed playing for the most part. The story could have been better, but it works well enough to make you think at bit. There really isn't any voice acting, but when there is it works. There were times when I really wanted to like this game more than I do. It never let me down completely, but it also didn't blow me away. If it is less than ten dollars, pick it up. Otherwise wait it out.The more I think about it. This game is not well made or fun enough to purchase at any price over five dollars.			"

												Has the idea of saving an immersive social network with the ability to keep deceased loved ones alive ever appealed to you? Then this might just be the game for you.First off this game took me by surprise. Although not as polished as a triple-A title it has a unique charm about it that draws you in and keeps you interested. The whole story behind this game is very intriguing and reminds me of very few other titles. And although the storyline was thin it was highly engrossing and kept me hooked right until the end. I just wanted to know more and find out everything I could about the world around me and the people in it.The level designs are tremendous; they have a charm about them that is just so unique and imaginative. Every single one of them offers something different to all the others, I loved just looking at everything around me and taking it all in each time. The characters are pretty interesting and every titbit of information I gleamed helped me feel immersed in these people’s lives and how you ended up lost in this world. The art style is great, very colourful, striking and a word I keep using unique.The gameplay is good too, a first person exploration game across a huge variety of stages, each with its own goals and objectives completely different to all those before. The puzzles are not the most difficult but offer enough satisfaction when you manage to figure them out. The enemy in this game takes on the form of a malevolent all powerful AI, as they often do, who will stop at nothing to destroy you. When she chases you it can be a little tense that’s for sure.The price tag is little high on this one but if you see it on sale it is well worth a play through. It may take a short time to really get into but once it’s sunk its teeth in there is no letting go.Have fun ^_^			"

Players aren't given a clue what to do.  I was dropped into this world and had to go through all the puzzles and such via trial and error, which was fine.  But imagine you need to run away from something but STILL had no clue what you needed to do, thus ""resetting"" constantly.  Okay, so then I figured it out after dying five times, but the whole encounter is based on how quickly you can swivel the camera and click.  >.<It's just a headache of a game that I don't want to play any more.

												I really wanted to love this game, and initial impressions were great. The visual style (to begin with) was very appealling, what with the spooky mist lit forest and the watery pool. But pretty soon the game descends into a hub based puzzler. Solve the puzzle, return to hub, solve next puzzle, wrince and repeat. At least, that's as far as I could stand to go.The game's mechanics let it down a little. No crosshair, so no way to guage whether or not you're on target with picking things up, and since some of the puzzles are timed that becomes an issue. Click, miss, die, repeat! Also, the controls felt a little twitchy. There were some graphical glitches too.The puzzles were rather obscure, and not very challenging. Just annoying. Rock three black hobby horses in the right order to activate two pink hobby horses. Why? How do the puzzles relate to the memories I am trying to recover? I don't feel connected in the least bit to the life I allegedly once had.The welsh flavour to the game would have been nice had it been profesionally presented, but it just came over as a wee bit too much Shadwell and not enough Tom Jones.A nice effort, but falls well short of the mark.

												This games manages to marry my tech career and my love or all things horror. The environment's high effect but relavitely low poly architecture give this game a wonderful, surrealistic feel. Rather than seeming cheap, Master Reboot's implementation comes across as elegant.There is not any pew-pew in this game. It's all exploration and puzzle solving. The puzzles are varied and never repetative. If there is a con, sometimes the puzzles are unclear or a required object may be far too elusive.The biggest disappointment about this game is its brevity. Wales Interactive estimates it has about 8 hours of play. I completed it in just 4. There are still achivements to be completed of course, but these are no substitute for actual content.Despite this, I wholeheartedly recommend this game, just not to everyone. I reccomend it for those who have patience and are unafraid of considering their own mortality. The game touches on some deep themes to go along with the puzzle solving.This game left me joyfully wanting to see more. And along came Soul Axiom...			"

												'Disorienting' is an excellent word to describe Master Reboot. It's kind of sci-fi and kind of horror with lots of walking around and a little puzzle solving. But the story comes from finding ducks. Yes, little blue squeaky ducks. Ducks give little bits of story details in each level. Nothing is particularly explicit in Master Reboot, except the animated cutscenes at the end of each level, with each level being someone's memory. Who that someone is, who you are, and who's trying to stop you is all part of the story you'll have to piece together from animated cutscenes and ducks. But it still mostly works. The pacing is a bit off, but if you play the levels ""in order"" (there is no numbered order, but levels unlock in groups and you can play them in a sequential order) you'll probably get the story by the time you get to the end. It's short, less than 3 hours beginning to end, but interesting enough. It's clearly a student effort but it's neat and weird.			"

												Fun and short puzzle game, (you can probably beat it in about 2-4 hours depending on how fast you complete everything). The storyline is somewhat hard to understand at first but once you find all the blue ducks, you will figure out what is going on. The puzzles the game presents to you are real easy and you can easily breeze through them. The graphics are very cartoonish, which isn't too bad but may not be appealing to everyone. The music on the other hand, is very enjoyable. The game controls are very basic so you shouldn't have any problems there. All in all I really enjoyed this game but it may not be to everyone's liking. Also it's non-sale price is a bit high so I would definitely wait for it to be on sale before purchasing it because like I stated before, the game is short.			"

Master Reboot Is not easy to evaluate. It contains both brilliant findings and significant drawbacks.First, drawbacks.Gameplay is the worst thing in this game. Complete linearity is not an issue, as storytelling manner and diverse surroundings keep brain busy, not letting you get bored. What is a gameplay issue - combined lack of complexity and lack of originality. You start playing a level, get grasp of what needs to be done, and then level ends. In gameplay perspective, Master Reboot is a collection of tutorials for different games: stealthy hide-and-seek, tetris-like car avoidance game, time race, Mario-like platformer and some more. Only gameplay elements that develop are exploration and puzzle-solving. Still, they are quite primitive. To say something pleasant, I will admit that one of the puzzles is truly brilliant and original. One out of circa two dozens. Four of which are actually the same puzzle that needs to be solved four times in a row (did I told you about lack of originality?)Art is second drawback. Everything player sees looks like it is made from plasticine. I am no fan of fancy graphics, but rectangular beds with rectangular pillows on them are a little too schematic even for me. Maybe this style is derived from Psychonauts, but somehow there it looked good and here it looks bad. Player gets ambushed by a ghost from a closet three times, and all those three times - same fighting animation of same models in same position (yes, 'position', not 'positions'). Sound sample library is quite small, you can hear recurring sound patterns. It all damages immersion into atmosphere badly, constantly reminding you that you are interacting with a simulation of simulation. Needs to be said, not all art is that bad - papers you find in blue ducks and drawings in Goddess of Death signs are actually awesome.Program names in Soul Cloud have .exe extension. Designers, are you kidding? You telling me that enormous cloud solution capable of holding human personality inside itself will run on Windows? No surprise it turned out so easy to hack!Now, merits.Game contains cool mechanic of hacking wood with an axe. I enjoyed it a lot. Also, axe is ultimate hacking tool in this game. Just great.Despite all those bad things I said about art, game atmosphere is clearly an advantage. Struggling with unknown world, recombining story of your life piece by piece and constant threats from Serene create great immersion and motivation to move on. Characters are good, their dramatic experience is interesting and understandable. Only exception is David, which looks like more of a human-like decoration than a living person. Antagonist deserves explicit kind word, as he is not a brutal destroyer, as it often happens, but a crazed creator.The strongest aspect of Master Reboot is storytelling (and, for that, I am ready to forgive all its drawbacks). What starts looking like simple cyberpunk narrative about people losing their personalities in a world of soulless demonic machines, slowly and subtly turns into story about people, whose struggle, hard work and love changed world, and reminds us about simple but important thing - machines can never change who we really are, only we can. It reminds us that tools we create can make our lives easier and happier, but they cannot make us kind, selfless, diligent and rational, as they cannot cure envy, malice or infantility.It reminds us that greatest threat for any human being is another human being, and that no machine should be feared more.This is not a game everyone would enjoy. But it surely is a good finding for those who are attuned to cyberpunk, used to complicated storytelling, and like asking questions about nature of human personality.			"

												Highly stylized puzzle / platformer game where you play through memories to uncover the story. The trailer makes the game seem like constant super-intense action, but it's actually really well paced, and feels more like exploration than anything.The story really has to be pieced together through scraps of details to get the most out of it, which I'm not really good at while playing... so the details of the story didn't really influence my enjoyment of the game any, but the basics of the story really added to the experience of the memories I think, given how they tended to be unnerving in nature.The art style in this game is really beautiful. Simple texture work and geometry, along with lots of bloom effects, shadows, and saturated lighting create really atmospheric dream-like levels. In some places the textures seem low-quality and ugly, but for the most part everything fits together better than most indie games manage to pull off. There are a bunch of cartoony vector art / cut-scenes which feel a bit out of place, but they're not bad. They remind me of Mirror's Edge's cut-scenes, and how they were a vastly different style from the actual game itself. There's also a lot of REALLY well done painted-style art, which was great to find.The sound design is extremely well done in this game... lots of stereo sound effects that add to the creepiness of the memories. The music itself is really great, and adds tension in all the appropriate places, and doesn't stick out while playing. It's really easy to slip into the experience they were trying to provide in this game.There really isn't a tutorial in this game... pretty much just action icons that appear when you can interact with something. You start off knowing absolutely nothing about your character or where you are.. so you wander around and discover things on your own. Even so, it's pretty straight forward, and you can't really do much other than progress forward, but it still feels more open than it actually is, which is pretty good.The majority of the puzzles in this game offer absolutely no explanation, so you have to really be observant, or resort to trial and error methods to solve them. At the beginning of the game discovering the solutions to the obscure puzzles felt super rewarding but later on just felt frustrating because they were so obscure. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult, and you can often find the solution in a couple of minutes. There are many clues to how to solve the puzzles in the design themselves, just through the use of things like color-coding. Some puzzles do have blatant hints, and some puzzles are based purely on memory or being able to repeat a pattern. I only really had an issue with a couple puzzles, and had to resort to trial and error simply because they weren't clear enough... so even though I was still able to solve them, I didn't necessarily know WHY it was the answer.The puzzles are really just a way to complete each memory sequence, to reveal the explanation of that memory. Within each memory there are things you can interact with in order to get more snippets of the story. Along the way there are occasional platforming scenarios, and even some time-based action sequences. I didn't really like the platforming, as I would tend to misstep and fall to my death constantly... but the action sequences were much better as they really added tension and creepiness to the game.The game took me around 4-5 hours to complete, which includes trying to find as many hidden things as possible, and lots of restarts due to platforming fails. There are a few wonky bits in the game (where you just wonder why the hell it was included), but way more memorable bits to offset them. The game most reminds me of Among Sleep, but similarish games include The Path, Kairo, and Antichamber.This might also be the first duck-based video-game I've ever seen...			"

												Warning: This game will leave you with many unanswered questions. Many.I hesitantly recommend this game because of the gaping holes in whatever concept of a storyline it seems to have, but if you are a fan of psychological thrillers, then you'd be a fan of this game.Personally, I'd favor a more structured background of your situation in the game, but if you appreciate mystery more than I do the pieces of the big puzzle can be a thrill to assemble.The games succeeds in two points: It's very eerie (a must have for games such as this), and its puzzles vary widely enough to stay interesting throughout the entire game. Whether it's mazes, lasers, shaped puzzles, item hunts, audio matchups, etc, every puzzle was simple yet complex enough to allow for the thrill and the (limited) storytelling in between.I picked this game up on sale, and if you're looking for a quick thrill, I recommend you do too.

												Finished this game and it's very fun if you like puzzles.  Most are not too hard to put together but there are a few that are not very clear on how to start them so don't be too frustrated.  I'd say these puzzles are not easy by any means so if you're not the puzzle type this game probably won't do it for you.The graphics at first seem blocky or cheap but it's the style of the game so don't let it dissuade you; I really enjoyed Seren's different looks and the enviroments.The only down side to this game is that it's quick; I finished it in three sittings but I take my time on games.  I'd say this game could be finished in one if someone wanted too.  Because of this you will need to make a judgment on what price you feel it's worth.They are coming out with a sequal (Soul Axiom) and it's going to be Early Access.   "

												This game is exactly what I needed. A first person puzzle game with a decent story. It doesn't hold your hand, and for that I'm thankful.This game eschews tutorials and instead relies on iconography and experimentation. It works really well the vast majority of the time - there's one or two places where it doesn't, but I'd still take this approach over tutorials any day.The puzzles themselves are mostly good, usually just dependent on exploring, which is an aspect I'm fond of. There were one or two that were frustratingly confusing and could have used a bit more guidance though.Finally, my only technical complaint is that the maximum resolution is 1080p. Given the style it's not a huge deal, but I don't know why they wouldn't support higher native resolutions. It's just annoying, especially when I open the in-game Steam overlay and it's hard to read because its blurry.In the end this game is a surreal blend of something like Myst and To the Moon.

												Fun and short puzzle game, (you can probably beat it in about 2-4 hours depending on how fast you complete everything). The storyline is somewhat hard to understand at first but once you find all the blue ducks, you will figure out what is going on. The puzzles the game presents to you are real easy and you can easily breeze through them. The graphics are very cartoonish, which isn't too bad but may not be appealing to everyone. The music on the other hand, is very enjoyable. The game controls are very basic so you shouldn't have any problems there. All in all I really enjoyed this game but it may not be to everyone's liking. Also it's non-sale price is a bit high so I would definitely wait for it to be on sale before purchasing it because like I stated before, the game is short.			"

												Play Master Reboot if you like: piecing together a story from scraps, Tron visuals, little girl jump scare horror, a great soundtrackLike Gone Home (a game I love despite not caring for major character's self realization), Master Reboot's story unfolds through items found in the environment. When I saw the QL on Giant Bomb, I had no idea that it was also an enviromentally terrifying game where the ""Little SIster/Alma from Fear"" enemies are an ever-present worry even when you're not sure they are in the level. Having finished the game, I am very glad I played it. $10 is well worth it, I believe.Be wary of the checkpoint near the end after repairing the tram. It's the last checkpoint if you restart the game after closing it. And the final battle has no checkpoint. Frustrating but doable.			"

												The concept and the ideas behind the game were fascinating, and would have lent themselves to a more complex game. Whenever the game was surreal and Tron-esque, I loved it. The simple graphics and puzzles fit far better then than to the distorted real world, where your main worry is jumpscares. Once you get desensitized to the jumpscare after jumpscare, you're left with average puzzles and limited game areas, which are cut off by a distracting red fence. The stages vary from peaceful roaming to crap-your-pants panic runs. The 2D animated cut scenes were so drastically different from the rest of the game, it almost gave my brain whiplash.Was it worth the four euros I bought it for? Yes. Am I glad I played it through? Yes. Will I play it again? No.			"

												Master Reboot is a story driven adventure game.  It has some interesting puzzles, the art style is beautiful, and at the same time the game has a nice creepy vibe to it.  *The Story*This game has one of the more interesting stories that I have seen for an adventure game.  Depending on how closely you follow it, it can take two or more playthroughs to fully understand what is going on.  At first you might seemed confused, but given time you will grasp the story.*The graphics/sound*The art style of this game is very impressive in my opinion.  Each level or area gives off its own vibe, whether it be vibrant, gloomy, or any of the other designs of the levels.  You get sucked in with the atmosphere.  The sound is also very good.  You can get a little panicked as you feel you are being followed by rustling behind you, screams or other odd sounds coming from who knows where, and other sounds that make you wonder what is going on.*Overall*I highly recommend this game.  As I said, it has a great vibe, nice engaging story, and can scare you at times.  The length isn't overly long, at a playtime of 3 hours if you don't rush it.  If you want something different then definitely check this game out.			"

												Master Reboot is an abstract puzzle game with some horror elements.  You are basically trapped inside someone's memories that have been stored in a computer while you attempt to escape from and destroy a virus.  Gameplay consists of solving puzzles to explore the memories and some occasional simple combat.  Most of the puzzles are straightforward which is a nice change of pace from some other games I've played recently.While the game doesn't start well with a rather poor introduction/tutorial level, it gets a lot more interesting later.  You make your way through memories of someone's life, slowly learning about their life as you progress.  Along the way you will find collectibles that give you more information about this person's life related to the memory they are found in.Graphically, the game is nothing special.  It uses a low detail art style with a dark horror-like atmosphere to emphasize the fact that you are inside someone's memories inhabited by a virus.  It works well, though the way colors are handled leads to some nasty color banding and really poor contrast in places.Overall I definitely enjoyed Master Reboot.  It's a unique experience unlike any other game I've played.			"

(Most of the cutscene that look like poor flash animation).- There is no story. Troughougts the journey you may collect (optional) clues and journals about what has happened in the backstory, but else nothing will actually happen or move the plot except in the final level, and maybe the library.The story is about a server where you upload the soul of dead people, but it doesn't feel like you're visiting the deads or their memories,.. it doesn't feel like you're doing anything meaningful.

												I'm not quite finished with this game yet, but feel compelled to review as I'm hopped up with a head swimming in thoughts about it but it's too late in the night to finish.Master Reboot is short of masterpiece status solely on account of simple graphics and a few non-intuitive puzzles; easy puzzles, but ones in which the solution is achieved by randomly clicking and with no logic between action and solution (here's looking at you, playground).The pros far outweigh the cons. The puzzles and environments are varied, never repetitive; the story is haunting, pieced together by messages and pictures you get from optional blue ducks, reversed engineered as you progress; the demons(?) are creepy as hell and made me jump every single time, sometimes just in anticipation. The music, environments and atmosphere all combine for a disturbing and horrific reason to stay up until 3am.I would definitely recommend, and will be getting Wales Interactive's next game Soul Axiom just as soon as it's out of early access.

												In general this game is generally good but I wouldn't go into it thinking its a competitor to other horror games like Amnesia, Penumbra, or Outlast. This game has moments where it shines and moments where you're gonna scratch your head and think why the developers did what they did. Where it shines: -The atmosphere of the game. This game is one of the best atmospheres that I've ever experienced. I am big into technology and cyber/sci-fi genre and that is where this game has so many brownee points. -The forshadowing and the mystery. The game is good where you start and barely know whats going on and once you start progressing, you start to figure things out and then things start to click together. -The art/graphics. The art and graphics of this game are so unique! You wont ever find a game like this that is in the horror/mystery genre that incorporates a cyber and technology feel while trying to spook you out at the same time. The graphics in this game are amazing. There would be times where I would just postpone solving puzzles just to walk around and take screenshots. Where it needed some leverage/extra hand:-The story is good and all but at the end of it , I found myself asking more questions and using a search engine to fill in the holes-The cutscenes are good but it goes back to my first point that they had more questions raised than answered-The story sometimes went to dissapointing parts that you hope it would not go to or you're sitting there thinking of a cliche you've already seen.Other than that. I still recommend this game based upon the gameplay mechanics and definitely the environment/art in this game. Don't focus on the story aspect as much or it'll be mediocre. Just concentrate on the the game and gameplay and graphics itself.#SoulCloudMemories			"

												Horrible performance on Mac! Lags all the time, even on 800x600/Low quality, playing is almost impossible. Cannot exit the game without forcing quit. (Snow Leopard). Total waste of money,Otherwise nice and horrifying atmosphere, experimental gameplay. Shame I can't play it.			"

												Master Reboot is a strange little game, but in a good sense. The art style is very pretty and well suited to the game, and although it's fairly basic geometry, it doesn't take anything away from the game. It in fact adds a lovely stylized look. The mechanics are very basic, but that also works very well for the game, as it's not overcomplicated and it allows more focus on the exploration and puzzle elements. The audio design is fantastic as well, adding a lot to the sometimes quite creepy atmosphere.All in all, a fantastic little game, and definitely worth grabbing, especially while it's on sale!			"

												Even a plain story is interesting if you are not reading it, but discovering it piece by piece :)This game takes place inside a virtual storage of memories, a place where you can relive parts of your or someone else's life, and even keep living after your physical body dies. Playing as a certain someone who may or may be not alive, you delve through corrupted memories of a group of friends who have shared triumph and tragedy. Putting pieces of past together, you find out what happened, what is broken and whether or not you can still fix it.While graphics are substandart and puzzles are dull, the game is an immersive travel through a beautiful void of surreal landscapes and abandoned places. The story is simple, but well presented, and the overall experience is deeply touching. If you liked like Myst, Dear Esther and Gone Home, this less known game would certainly please you.			"

												I've found this to be quite the enjoyable game although rather short. I love the ""Soul Cloud"" setting of game, the ambient music is well done and has made me feel weary/cautious in certain areas, especially when combined with the design in some of memory areas. Yes, the scares are cheap though they do work on someone such as myself, especially at 3AM Aha. (I walked around the corner and found just a normal giant teddy bear, but since I was navigating a maze in the pitch dark with just a torch, turning around and seeing it somehow scared the crap out of me Dx).Definitely worth playing in my opinion, but then again, I'm kinda easy to please most of the time.

												Very unique Tron-like environments. Most of the game is solving puzzles and searching for key items, with some 3d platform action and spooky stealth.The game has its share of jumpscare spooky scary moments, but they're done well, adding just the right amount of tension.There's an overarching plot of death and mayhem and sabotage that gets unraveled by clicking ducks throughout the game.I could see some people getting annoyed with the exploration and with certain puzzles. I was on the brink of looking up walkthroughs more than once, but each time I wound up finding the next necessary thing soon after.I could see some people getting annoyed with the 3d platforming. It took me many tries to get past the last room. It wasn't horrible, just takes some practice and skill. If you're a paraplegic wanting puzzles-only, this is not the game for you.I could see some people getting annoyed by the jumpscares. But as long as you aren't at risk for heart attacks and you can tolerate spooks, don't let them stop you from playing.The game is very unique, satisfying, and creepy.			"

The style is appealing and the art fits very well.The only negative thing I'd have to say about it is that a few of the post-memory levels were annoyingly time-sensitive (the one after the Park memory, speficially). Other than that, it's a very enjoyable game and a well put together story.			"

												A fantastic bit of mind-bending, high-concept, hard sci-fi wrapped in a heart-wrending doomed love story wrapped in an actually-kind-of-mediocre horror game.(Minor spoilers ahead, kind of)It's not like it has bad atmosphere or anything, it's just not incredibly scary. Part of that is down to the level design. The story kind of mandates that the levels be haphazard jumbles (it'll make sense when you play it), but that means that the gameplay tends to devolve into traipsing around samey environments hunting for various keys for various doors, and monotony kind of spoils the otherwise-excellent atmosphere. Many times, the game would attempt a jump-scare, or the soundtrack would freak out in such a way as to indicate that a jump-scare was supposed to be happening somewhere, but they forgot to do the work of making me look in that direction first. That's not to say it didn't make me jump when the various horror elements  did  line up, but the design could stand some tightening up.That's all a shame, because when the game is at its peak, the experience is to die for. Repetetive environments notwithstanding, the visual design is generally gorgeous, presenting a unique and vibrant virtual world that manages to vary respectably while maintaining a coherent art style. From an aesthetic standpoint, it's absolutely fantastic, even if it's really nothing new in terms of horror elements. Little girls with supernatural powers and psychological issues? Seen it. Childrens' toys coming to life? Seen it. Ominous graveyards? Seen it. Deserted fairgrounds? Seen it. Not a deal-breaker, but it just makes the actual points of novelty seem few and far between. I wish it could have been as rich to experience as it is to look at, is my point. There's one plot point (really trying not to spoil here) that crescendos towards the climax in a way that makes it seem like it's going to go somewhere completely insane and mind-blowing...and then it doesn't.All that criticism aside, I still did play through to the end and I would recommend it for its excellent storytelling regardless of any technical issues.There are several really intense emotional moments, and it's refreshing to see a work all about the digital age and transhumanism that actually has a  point  it's trying to make. And if you can look past a couple of imperfections in the design, this one will reel you in like few others can.			"

												I really loved Master Reboot's unique art stlye and dense, unsettling atmosphere (which was helped by the great sound design). The story, while a bit hard to follow at first, was quite intriguing, and the puzzles were interesting and very creative, if not particularily hard. Pacing was great, too, except for a bit of a difficulty spike in the last couple of minutes (right before the end is _not_ the time to start with lengthy first-person platform jumping puzzles on a timer). Playtime was ~4 hours.Verdict: 7.5 / 10, would buy (and will play) again.			"

												I see this game has mixed reviews. Some people do not like the game and some other, like me, just loved it.I think it has a lot to do with the gameplay.Master Reboot plays like a FPS. Except that... the story is made for a point & click design.You do not need über FPS skillz to play the game as there is no fighting. At all.The point of the game is to discover what's going on.Who are you? What is this place?And why. Why are you here?See, the story is the strong point of the game. Some reviewers are saying it's like the story of Facebook, and is the story about two persons. Hmm... not really. Not wrong though, but it's much deeper than that. There are 4 characters to get to know in the game. One of them being the central piece of the puzzle. Even though the story itself might remind you of the Caprica TV show, or even Ghost in the Shell, the story is a puzzle.You will travel into memories. Each memory has an associated place, like the school, the hospital, etc. In each 'world' you need to gather memory pieces that are symbolized as ducks. You heard me, cute DUCKS. Why? … I don’t have a clue. So you need to find those glowing ducks lying around. When you find one, a memory fragment is revealed: it's a picture that will show something. Like a conversation between two characters, some document and stuff. This is how you will understand the story. This is the way the game ‘storytells’ you what’s going on. This will highlight the different characters relationships and their feelings.Okay, let's face it once and for all, this game feels like it had girls/women/slaves/females targeted as a main audience. Love is the central point of the story. I would spoil explaining that further. So, gameplay wise, don't expect to shoot shït up. The FPS part is to immerse yourself better in the environment. That's all.Environment which, I think, is awesome. Graphics are very light with almost no textures at all. But there are very good shaders, and lighting effects. Like Ray of Gods that are overused, but it's very pretty. The whole game has this weird dreamy atmosphere, unrealistic colors, and such. The 3D environment is simply art, for me. There is a lot of metaphors in object placements, the rooms, and such. Notice that when you go back to child memory everything seems bigger, like when you were little. I think this style fits the story very well, and I find it gorgeous. Keep in mind, that we are shown fragments of memories: the no texture part represents this. However it is globally way too dark, and that’s bad.There are puzzles to solve in order to move on. Those are extremely simple. But, there is a huge thumbs down: some are wrong or don't make sense. For example, at some point you have to reorder the planets of our solar system, from the sun to the outer space. But, the 'right' order is screwed. Some planets are mixed up. :/ very unprofessional.Also a lot of puzzles rely on color. Don't freak out, I am colorblind too. But it’s okay as they are very bright, like full neon red or green. Backgrounds are mostly dark and colors do not touch each other, so they don’t blend and don’t fûck your eyes. For the planet part, that was a pain though. Colors are... undetermined for me. Just check a walkthrough for this part, don't waste time. Most puzzles are related to the memories. That planet part is to show that one of the character was fond of Maths and Physics. Some other don't make sense at all. Or maybe I just don't see the metaphors there. Can’t be more specific without spoiling.Audio puzzles are presents, so for deaf people, sorry but forget about this game :(A lot of hearing people had trouble solving them. You have to play back a series of sounds you hear. Whether that’s clicking on piano keys or shooting bells. I had no problem doing that. A couple tries and I was good to go. Even succeeding a bell puzzle in one go.Graphics options. You cannot adjust shaders, lightning and stuff. Just low, medium high crap presets. Too bad the game would have benefitted A LOT from antialiasing. If you read this, and haven't played the game yet, override the game antialiasing with your built-in graphic card software. Really do it. And now something very, very bad is the lack of FOV slider. I have no trouble with FOV in general and could play this game fine.But there is one part of the game, where stuff were spinning super-fast, and you need to hop on those things. Once you are on those platforms, the screen spins and spins and you gotta move/jump to another spinning stuff. Well, I had motion sickness there, which might have been the first time of my life in a video game. Also I was eating at the same time eheh... uhhhgg.I had to look down me feet to just see something that was not moving and regain 'balance' lol. So if you are experiencing this, be careful. A lot of people on the forum said they had to play by 30 minutes intervals before having headaches. But you can edit a config file to pop a debug console and change the FOV to 180 in-game. Not cool but that's the only solution.The sounds part, is bad. Yeah, some SFX are super loud. And there is no ‘spacialization’ which is a shame really. Some SFX like footsteps and such will disturb you as those are in Stereo. So sometimes you will be like 'someone is there... LEFT!.. uh no … they went to the RIGHT!' But that's it. The music is alright, but I don't remember what it was. It means that it was not mind-blowing. I think it was most likely white noise sometimes, or some kinda electronic light ambiance stuff.Let's move on to the 'horror' part. As you see the last part of this review. Simply because: it's not scary. I was not afraid, never. There is an 'enemy' in the game, that's right. Sometimes they will scare you with sudden noises, stuff moving very fast in front of you, or the enemy's peeking head around a corner, disappearing instantly. Once you have seen a few of those, you will be immune. Dying is like respawning at the beginning of a level. No big deal, it's all about exploration. Once you know where to go, it take barely a minute to go back where you were. The first time I saw the 'enemy' I actually thought that it was a friendly :)I mean there is nothing scary about that 3D model. Most monsters are red colored. That's not the case here as it's blue/purple. So I was like 'Hey, who are you georgou--- Arggh!' --> respawn. So okay, that was the bad guy. No, for me, there is absolutely no horror element at all there.It is all about the why. Yeah why is there a bad guy in the first place? What's it doing there? I was more curious about that tango, and trying to catch them than escaping from them lol. Who dat? You know, that was my reaction. Nothing scary there.So there you go: The story and art are worth it. This game somehow reminds me of Trauma which is pretty similar from an art perspective.Oh, and, the game is also available in full Welsh. You heard me.			"

 Positive + Interesting premise; exploring human memories through a server-based environment is intriguing in and of itself+ The sci-fi setting and several locales that you visit throughout the game are fairly well-designed + While the graphical quality of the game is nothing to boast about, the vivid colour palette prevents the game from looking ugly+ The puzzles that you solve throughout the majority of the game are relatively creative and simple (possibly too simple at times). Negative - Some areas of the game are based too much on trial and error, leading to repetition (and at times annoyance), bogging down the whole experience- The horror elements of the game are very poor: cheap jump scares and weak sound design accompany you throughout the short campaign (just under 3 hours); the game would’ve been much better having focused solely on the puzzle elements rather than trying to unnecessarily frighten the player. Verdict “This is quite a difficult game to recommend. At times it feels unpolished, but for an indie game it’s possible to overlook that simple fact (not to say that just because it’s an indie game that it can get away with it either). If you’re looking for a fairly short and simple puzzle game with a little atmosphere (which was what I expected it to be), and can look past the annoying horror elements, then I’d recommend you get this on the cheap like I did.” 6.5/10 TJBs  "

												Master Reboot is a great game. Each mission shows a glimpse of the story line. The atmospheric feel of the game builds suspence. Even though this game is in the very least frightening it still makes the hairs on your arm stand up. The colors are vibrant floresent colors which is a very nice touch on the graphic design (I find it so eye catching). I wish there were updates to the game so it would have more missions, it has about 9+ and then the final one but they're not long, so the game ends sort of quickly. I believe this game if more time was put into it could have a lot more potential.			"

												If you're interested in a game with gorgeous visuals, an eerie soundtrack and an engaging story, then this is a game for you.The story is not as much told as it is gradually uncovered and interpreted by the player (Really... There are clues hidden everywhere in the game, and they're mostly mementos, messages, pictures and other what-not - not to mention that the worlds you travel through are based on memories). There is something really engaging about trying to piece together all the clues you have uncovered in a way that makes sense... Then stumble upon an extra clue that will make you reconsider your entire theory !(If you've reached this point in the review, congratulation ! I have managed to convey to you my appreciation of the game ! I can now discuss the weaker aspects of the game)The gameplay has its weak moments. When you're trying to do something original for each puzzle, there's bound to be hits & misses. Sometimes, you don't now what you're supposed to do. Other time, you'll stumble on a small plateform puzzle that will thwart your efforts until you figure the timing out. You generally get it after a few deaths - thankfully, there are regular checkpoints in those cases.All in all, if you like a good story, then don't get discouraged by the metascore : the game is worth its price.

The visual is excellent, I live the whole retro scifi thing, and even though the gameplay is a little outdated, it works fine with the game. If you like beginning > middle > end > conclusion, don't play it. If you like a good story and a few scarejumps, it's a must.			"

The simple graphics hide an eerie beauty that really has to be seen, and shows that you don't need super detailed polys and textures to create an engaging environment. With each piece of the puzzle you take one step closer to possibly finding out who you are and if going all the way to the end is that important to you.			"

												Fabulous game... just beat it. Even though the graphics aren't the latest and greatest, I still enjoyed the visual experience quite a bit. There was a nice variety in the levels. Some levels are about exploring, some are more about puzzle solving, and yet others are more action-oriented. To be honest, I figured out the plot early on. But that didn't matter much, as each level was kind of a mini-game in-itself. It's definitely not the scarriest game. But, I see it as more horror-style than survival horror if that makes sense. I think if you like the visual aspects of horror and cyberpunk, this is one worth checking out. I got it on a Steam Cyberpunk game sale, but I think it's worth $15. Ran OK on my 2011 iMac. Some of the cutscenes popped and crackled a bit. The gameplay itself was adequately smooth, but not terrific. To sum up, I'm looking forward to Soul Axiom.			"

												Master Reboot looks like the coolest game ever made. A dark, moody cyberpunk game with a really cool concept – after death people can be stored in a “soul cloud”, and their relatives and friends can interact with these AI ghosts. You start plugged into the soul cloud, and it’s obvious that something has gone terribly wrong. Parts of the world are missing, or broken, and you’re being stalked by a roving anti-virus program called Serra.exe, who just so happens to materialise as Sadako from Ring during her raver years. From a gameplay angle, Master Reboot is more Gone Home than System Shock 2. If you enjoy these “walking simulators” – storytelling through exploration of environment – you’ll probably find a lot to like about Master Reboot. The puzzles gating off one area to the next could charitably be described as “rudimentary” – most of them are variations of “find yellow, green and red keys and deliver them to the corresponding lock”. While they facilitate environmental exploration, as a gameplay mechanic I found them very tedious. Even the few genuine puzzles tend to be pretty braindead, usually solved in seconds (sometimes by accident). The game does briefly flirt with other game styles, including stealth, shooting and platforming, but the game was obviously not designed to accommodate these shifts – the single level utilising stealth is laughably easy, with Serra patrolling up the middle of a plane while you push buttons when her back is turned. Unless you walk into her limited field of view, you’re safe – as long as you do not touch her you can jump around inches from her back. Evasion consists of nothing more than crouching by a seat until she’s passed.The last level suddenly becomes a timed precision first person platformer – something which I believe is now considered a war crime in most civilised countries. The controls are clumsy, and the timing is so tight that any kind of mistake will essentially force you to restart. Completing the game at that point was frankly a relief, and almost managed to sour the goodwill the game had built up.In spite of these issues the story and atmosphere does just about manage to carry the game – the cold, minimalist cyberpunk environments and creepy sound design are often brilliant with particular mention going to the excellent lighting, though there are a couple of amateurish stages that let the side down. The scares do sort of work, especially early on, but they’re very scripted and it soon becomes clear that there are only a small number of circumstances where Serra can actually harm you. There are also bizarre, cartoonish flash style interludes that are not only poorly drawn and animated, but jar with the aesthetics of the game as a whole. The game would have been stronger as a whole with those story elements woven into the game in a less incongruous manner.Master Reboot often feels like a student project, scrappy and unfinished but built with obvious enthusiasm and love for the craft. As a result it is a game that is impossible to hate – but 12 quid is proper game money, and that means it must be held up against the standards of its peers. In that cold, harsh light the game just does not stack up. If you can find it in a sale, I might tentatively recommend it, particularly if you are forgiving of clunky mechanics.			"

												A horror/adventure/puzzle indie game made by Wales Interactive about storing deceased people's memories and personalities in a server called the Soul Cloud is an intriguing story and a well told one by the use of the wonderfully done environmental clues and by the mostly well done puzzles. One or two of the puzzles are, however, a bit too obscure and trial and error but they are far and few between and doesn't detract from the overall experience. Master Reboot's artsyle looks utterly gorgoues. It helps build a fantastic sense of atmosphere and suspense and the excellent use of shadow and lighting makes some parts of the game breathtakingly pretty and some parts genuinely tense and creepy during it's horror moments. This is complimented by the ambient soundtrack which supports the atmosphere really beautifully.It also supports the Welsh language, which being a Welshman myself, is very nice to see since hearing Welsh in videogames is almost non-existent.I found Master Reboot to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

You will have to complete/recover parts from your past. From baby to adult. The game doesn't sound that amazing as it seems be to be. But it will get the job done for low level end machines. The levels are played in chapters, but the chapters are pretty short. Each chapter has a background story and some puzzles.Has Puzzles and Okay art.Okayish story line.Could get stale after awhile.Game is short.Graphics okish.Game is not super Scary.It has collectables.Other things.This game is decent for people who wants to try a horror game for a first time or for people who want to build it up.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												Master Reboot started a little slow, but once you started getting enough cluse to build the story it was fun guessing and new clues became available. Most of the puzzles through out the game are fairly easy. In the end there was 4 that would have been extreamly impossiable if it weren't for screenshots YAY! I did not like the fact that you can not make saves. The game saves for you and does not really tell you when. Now if I want to try for more acheivments I have to start over. Graphics are basic, but with the brilliant light added it gave life to it. The horror/thriller aspect I think needed to be intensified a bit. My son 7 year old was a bit scared, but still enjoyed it with me. I would give this a 84/100 This should be selling for $10 buck I think.			"

												The game started great.Very nice atmosphere with decent graphics (rather blocky, but well made) and a captivating story in a atmopheric and spooky environment and great sounds and music. The dreamy like landscape and the clues and cutscenes fit well together, even if the style of the drawings is a bit off compared to what you see in game. But its livable, and still ads to the game.Some of the puzzles sould have been better thought out (the walls in the library are too similar to find way round, the symbols in the cemeraty are not clear, and the music repetition gets a bit old)But now, when the developers ran out pizza, it took a turn for the absolute dreadful.The story has become technobable, the atmosphere in the game is completly gone, and the graphics unique style that hid the low polygon count blocky elements have all but gone, leaving a very poor version of Tron 2.0 behind. Flaoting squares and neon bands glowing ? How un-original.But mst annoying of all, I have reached a point where I have to smash five cubes in 180 seconds, and having tried it for a long evening, I have given up.I consider myslf a seasoned FPS games I cant complete this. The games poor thought process (if you know you cant make it you cant restart the process, and you can save the exact spot if you are doing good) means its just too frustrating to continue. I did not go into this game looking for a jumping match, and even a very poor one at that.Furthermore the game crashes on exit.I would hope for an update, but I doubt that will happen, so Ill just wish for a new game from the same developer when they dont run out of pizza and coke halway down the development and give it to some dilletant for completion.

												This game is a really good game, it is however, very directed towards thinkers. The story is one you have to be thinking about the whole time, as it's given to you in pieces, and the details at first are very confusing because of how general they are, later though, they get more detailed and as you start actively piecing them together, the core of the story starts becoming known. A fair bit of warning is that the story requires a decent amount of interpretation on your own part. As well as this is a puzzle game, it is very well done, and some of them you really have to think for. This also goes to say that it's got horror in the mix, and I'm glad to say there are some parts where generally I felt pretty scared, and the environment and audio does a decent job of adding to the horror (not to mention the game does some pretty scary things too, however it's something to be experienced, so I'll just leave it at that.) At first I thought it was going to be something like Amnesia, where you're gonna have to run and hide from the spooky scary peoples... Glad to tell you that's not the case, maybe there is one instance where it feels like that, but thankfully it's not painful to get past. Don't let that make you think that this game isn't scary though, it was at least to me, generally a decent horror game where I felt anxiety at parts to continue, however the story is what kept me moving, I wanted it to finish, and I feel that this was the best way to tell the story for the style of game that it is.It meant sitting down after playing it, and having to think about all the pieces and put them together piece by piece to get to the point where I could comprehend the plot in its entierty, like a book. It was more then likely in my opinion the best way to tell the story, not only that but the mental workout of piecing things together while solving puzzles really gave me this feeling of satisfaction and giddiness. I haven't had to sit down and piece together a story in a long time, as well as I haven't played a good puzzle game that didn't involve trying to break space and time, in a very very long time. So it was a very nice refreshing change from the usuall games I have been playing.I would most certainly recommend this game if you like thinking, especially when it comes to story, and enjoy puzzles.

												The overwhelmingly positive reviews got me to buy this game and I expected something beautiful and complex.What I got was a rather humble thing. The graphics are horrible except for a few effects.The bulk of game consists of a hub area from where you can access other levels by entering the scattered buildings.Each has a theme, for example: Hospital, Graveyard, Fairground, Childhood, Street.Some challanges: Shoot targets in a fairground booth, replay a tune on a little musical instrument, assemble a picture, precision jumping, finding objects in the dark with a flashlight.If I had to come up with an explanation how this game came to be, I would say, the developers played around constructing stereotypical mock-maps, such as a playground, a library, a hospital, all very barren and simple and when they had around 10 of these, they tied them together with the concept, that it's all the digitalized memories of a deceased person.I didn't enjoy the game after maybe the first hour, but completed it out of compulsion or because I payed for it, I don't know, I wanted to see how it ends. Lowest quality of a game I've ever paid for.Want to address the positive stuff too, but I'm really struggling with it. Sometimes I felt that the minds behind this have some interesting thoughts but since I'm not their parent I'll focus on the major impression of the game which is poor design and gameplay not on the lingering suggestion of something good.The only people I can recommend this to, are the welsh, to support their home team if they like.

												The biggest problem with this game is the puzzles, and they are the crux of the gameplay.  The sound and atmosphere are nice, but the environments are tiny and barren so there isn't much to be had there.  Half the time you're either scouring boring levels for something hidden or spamming the action key trying to get something to work.  For example, there is one puzzle where you need to find a rectangle.  Yep, lots of detail there, and when you use it with a certain object, the object grows to be very tall so you can get... a triangle!   The puzzles have little to do with the overarching plot of the game.  Overall I'm pretty unimpressed.			"

												An ambitious game that makes the familiar mistake of having an unavoidable, janky, and poorly implemented stealth section that is required to proceed and has no checkpoints throughout.A third of my playtime was spent ducking into the darkened sections of an airplane that are supposed to hide you from a woman passing through the aisle who, if she catches you, sets you back to the start of the stage with all your progress reset. Of course, whether or not it actually works is completely random, as the AI randomly decides each time it passes whether or not it is going to notice you. It only takes one time to reset you, and there's nothing you can do about it.No thanks.			"

												While the game has a good premise and great atmosphere; it suffers from abstract puzzles and design flaws. First off - If you don't like jump scares, probably best to stay away. There's several in this game; and while they're not so prevalent that they get annoying; some just seem unnecessary. Level design felt average; with nothing standing out that made me excited. Some were cool ideas, while some felt tacked on just to add another puzzle. The dev's have gone with a sort of ""abstract art"" sheme with polygons and 'blocky' models. While this is all good when done right; sometimes it seems they did it simply to ""cut corners"". Some models look straight out of a game from the mid-90's (i.e. the airplane). Round objects like pillars and orbs have straight edges; a lot of textures are very low quality or non-existent, and lighting felt very basic. It's as if they went for a cell-shaded game but didn't quite commit.This doesn't necessarily take away from the game, but it definitely doesn't add to it; and there several times when I was left wondering ""why did they do that?""The puzzles range from your typical ""library maze"" and ""simon says"" to some that are so abstract and ""outside of the box"" that they become frustrating.  Most of the puzzles are ""trial and error""; with nothing really explaining what the goal is. Some are so ""out there"", that it takes incredibly long to do something that should be simple. This leaves you wandering around trying to find anything that you might have mised; when usually there nothing else and it's just by chance or luck that you figgure it out.Some puzzles are designed well, but are frustrating because of poor level design i.e. switches that don't work unless you're in the perfect spot; activating switches that are close to others will activate the undesired one; or something hiding in the shadows. It feels very clunky and unintuitive compared to most puzzle games.The story itself is interesting; but it suffers from the long ""pauses"" of trying to solve these abstract puzzles that don't relate in any way to the story, and you start to loose interest. There's also no voiceovers for the cutscenes showing the ""past""; so you sit in complete silence watching the story unfold. In a game like this, lighting is key. However, while the ""ambient"" lighting is fantastic; lighting on objects and models is horrid. There is no dynamic lighting, so you don't get the ""shadow play"" effect that creeps you out even more. Static shadows are grainy, murky messes. The flashlight (which is only in a few levels) only lights up a (polygon) cone and doesn't cast shadows and is full of glitches. Most un-lit corners are pitch black while there's a light 2 feet away. This actually takes away from the game as it keeps players from exploring, (or even seeing) most of the level.All in all, it's an OK game with very few good puzzles, and while the story is presented poorly, it's not a terrible premise. If you get this game I'd recommend getting it during a sale, so if you get frustrated you don't feel so guilty about letting it go. I can only recommend this game if you get it for cheap, and\or if you REALLY like puzzle games no matter how abstract or obtuse they are.6\10			"

												I picked up this game on sale, and I'm glad I did. That statement is twofold. I'm happy I played the game, but I'm also happy I only paid the sale price for it. Overall, it was a positive experience, but there were some sections that were personally frustrating. The negatives: The most frustrating thing for me was the platforming elements. I imagine if you're a gamer who likes platforming games, that they will probably be easy and no cause for concern. I however am not a platform gamer and there were a couple sequences in the last level that I found rather frustrating. Second, the collection elements of the game slow you down as you go through levels and can remove the tension that this type of horror game wants to create and destroy it. A minor complaint I have was the ""bell"" puzzle in the last level, this a musical puzzle and I'm basically tone deaf. Again, this may not be a problem for all players but it was for me. Finally, some of the animated 2d art was at a lower quality than the rest of the game, it was very notable in several of the close up shots on hands. The positives: The storytelling. Oh, the storytelling. The world setting was personally appealing to me, with fun touches of science-fiction. More importantly though, was the core story itself. I won't say a lot, so as to avoid spoilers, but following the twists and turns of these young women's lives was a very entertaining experience and it made for a fun psychological thriller. The method of story presentation added a lot to the game as well. A lot of the story was told through single still images that you found as “memories” located throughout the game. Stopping to search for these did hurt the ambiance, as I previously mentioned, but it did make for a rewarding experience as you worked to uncover the truth of what had happened. In retrospect, it is rather ironic that one of my personal gripes about the game also contributed to one of the parts I enjoyed the most. The level design was done well and did have a good feel to it when you were moving through it at a reasonable pace. The last pro I want to list is the 2d art that found by viewing the tattoo glyphs (and in the final level, on the walls) was creepy, disturbing, beautiful and technically accomplished. tldr; The game has flaws, but if you like horror and don’t hate platforming elements, its worth playing. The story is a blast to uncover.			"

After downloading the game and starting it up I was greeted by a very poor looking flash cutscene and thought I was tricked into buying a crap game, this was not the case. After the cutscene you are thrown into a world that is extremely artistic and creepy. I am not very far into the game mind you, but from what I played I must say I enjoyed very much. My only problem as stated before are the flash cutscenes, they make the game feel cheap and it ruins the immersion of the game. Other then that I would give this game a 9.5 / 10.			"

												Poorly optimized and noticed some bugs. Lacks in options, like couldn't go for 1920x1200 resolution which is the native resolution of my monitor.Haven't finished the game yet. Basically you choose a level and then you end up somewhere and you have to figure out what to do. So far pretty easy puzzles and stuff but also interesting ones. It's one of those games that are hard to describe.Oh well anyway, I look forward for the next levels. Would recommend to pick it up from sale, but probably not at full price. Mostly because of the performance issues. Might be just my setup, but let's be honest. It's not that good looking game and runs on unreal3.			"

												Somewhat brief but fun first-person exploration game. The plot for this is somewhat unique - something about people being able to upload their memories into the ""cloud"" to live on in a state of semi-eternity, with some twists concerning spurned lovers and server crashes and other stuff that (honestly) I stopped trying to understand.There's a slight element of horror here and the occasional jump-scare, but nothing truly terrifying.There were two things that annoyed me somewhat, but neither enough to kill my interest. First, parts of the story are told through a series of hand-drawn pictures, and I didn't find the quality of the artwork in these pictures up to snuff with the artwork in the rest of the game. They looked a bit underwhelming, to be honest.Second, the game has a few difficulty spikes that seem to come out of nowhere and frustrated me. First, there's a level where you must dodge cars driving straight at you, very quickly. Part of the difficulty here is that you get 4 ""hits"" before the level resets, and you can be hit one (or more) times a split second after you spawn. I nearly gave up on the game after this, but eventually made it through. The second difficulty spike is the very last level, where you have 180 seconds to destroy 5 cubes in 5 different platforming challenges. 4 of those are not too hard once you get the hang of them. The fifth one involves jumps over gaps of different sizes, and (for me) was intensely frustrating, particulary knowing that it was the last thing I had to do to complete the game.Those complaints aside, I really did enjoy this. It was clever, looked good and didn't overstay its welcome.			"

												I enjoyed this game. The story is not bad and the levels are interesting. The puzzles were fun to figure out and the soul cloud idea was thought provoking. However, there are some glitches in this game that cause it to crash forcing me to reboot the game (not the OS but just the game even so... lol! l can't get over how ironic that is considering its title maybe this was supposed to be part of the fun!). The controls are not that fine-tuned so some of the games that require accuracy are not fun but become frustrating (I can only think of 2 or 3 at the moment so the overall number of these games is low compared to the total amount of puzzles/games probably less than 5% but some of them are at the end of levels so if you don't pass it you have to restart the whole level (ugh!)). The save system is also not that great since it's autosave and doesn't save within a level forcing you to restart a whole level if you don't make it the whole way through. As you progress through the game, you have to leave the main area where the memories are. At this point  you are not able to go back to these memories. This was annoying because I wanted to get the achievements after I had beaten the game and there was no way back except starting a new game and redoing it all. It was still pretty fun the second time around though.Even with these minor glitches and gameplay issues this was a fun game.			"

												A first-person puzzle/thriller game, it does a good job of setting a spooky digital atmosphere. It can be frustrating as there is no explanation of controls or anything else in the game so a lot is trial and error. If you are familiar with FPS games then most of the controls will be intuitive such as Shift to run or Ctrl to crouch, and E to use. You go through several different digitized environments basically collecting clues and solving puzzles that gradually unfold the story, though there is very little in the way of direct conversation. It fits well with the theme and you may feel a bit like a detective as you try to piece together just what is going on. Ultimately, a fair bit is left to your imagination. Other than some poorly explained controls and puzzles, it is a fun though brief game at about 3-4 hours.			"

												Master Reboot is a wonderful puzzle based exploration game. Where it falls is it's obvious attempt at horror when it's simply just not very horrifying. If you can get over that the idea behind dream surfing is very enjoyable and the landscapes are very interesting and compelling.I did a review + Playthrough for this game if you're interested.

												NOTE:  spoilers at the bottom of the review.I was quite engaged in this game, up until the latter half, where the writing grew much weaker.  It was a fun playthrough, and I think it was worth the time I spent playing it.Pros:- Pretty graphics, cool settings- Well-executed tension and fear aspects, the sounds and settings keep you on edge.- Interesting, fairly effective storytelling, lets you figure it out as you go along- Most of the puzzles aren't too easy or godawfully hard- Completion requires specific effort, but isn't impossible or overly tedious- Simple gameplay, doesn't rely on fancy controls or inventory- Very cool base conceptsCons:- Most of the end sequence is incohesive.- The boss fight is boring, frustrating, and tedious.- Feels reliant/heavy on jump scares.- The plotline itself is pretty boring.- The antagonist being mentally ill is not a new or interesting idea, and isn't executed in a new or interesting way, and the story plays out pretty predictably after that revelation.

												Loved this game, but it was a bit short; only took me 5 hours. The puzzles are not too hard, the graphics are a simple style that I enjoy, and the environments were eerie and lonesome. There's really no explanation of the story at all, they just throw you right into the game, and let you figure it out. Some puzzle style games can be annoyingly difficult, but this was just right for a leisurelly puzzle game. Great game :)			"

												This game is good.EDIT (2/22/2015 12:09 AM): I can't decide if this game is good, or really good. I think it is really good. I had to think about it more to figure that out.EDIT (2/22/2015 3:49 PM): After sleeping on it, I think the game is just good. It won't be amazingly good until I play it for the 2nd time tonight. Will update review then.EDIT (3/2/2015 12:03 AM): Sorry, I never stopped playing the game since then so I couldn't add to my review. Now that I'm a quarter of the way through the game, I believe that the creator of this game was inspired by the Gettysburg Address.EDIT (7/12/2015 1:56 AM CET) I took a trip to Berlin for a few months to find myself after playing this game. I had many sleepless nights, tossing and turning over what I had seen. There were two distinct ideas residing in my mind: this game was either my messiah or my personal hell. I needed to travel to a city as split in twain as my heart to understand how to move on, how to regroup, how to heal. This will be my last edit. It was in the arms of a plain but empathetic ""woman of the night"" that I had a revelation. I saw before me what could happen when two bodies become one. I saw a unification of ideas in a way I was not even capable of seeing before Master Reboot forced me to grow. I finally feel like I know what I have needed to know since I first clicked ""write review"".This game is alright, buy it on sale I guess if you're really interested but it's whatever "

												This game is ugly. Very ugly. Everything is blocky and soulless, and not in a stylised way. The audio is very... I wouldn't say low quality, but bland and it all sounds like stock sounds/music. I imagine the story is good, but seeing the comments here, it seems like a boring game. The areas all seem very small and use an abuse of lighting that tries to substitute ambiance but all it ends up doing is making the whole thing very, very ugly. In a forest? You can barely see anything. You get this little exposition video in the form of some sort of infomercial for the very uncreatively named company (misspelled word, woooo) and the voiceover is atrocious for one reason: it feels like someone talking to you on Skype, not an official video a company would show the public and new employees.The lack of quality in the visuals and the audio really turned me off, something that doesn't really ever happen to me, which is saying something.I realise I'm probably being very harsh on this game, seeing as how it's an indie game and I barely played it, but I really, really got turned off by it. You get this axe in the first level and the hit detection for the GIANT logs you have to cut is absolutely terrible; I somehow had trouble cutting them at times. Pushing the seemingly out-of-place minecarts gave me the same problem. Just... something felt very off about the game, and not in the horror way; in the technical way.Maybe it all gets better, maybe I'm just being a picky prick, maybe my instincts are right, maybe they're not... but either way, no matter if my opinion were positive or not, this game is not worth the full price. It seems to be a 4-5 hour long game and for 17$? Not worth it. If you really want this (because I do believe there's an audience for this game), wait for a sale.			"

												Finished the game in 5 hours.  and I did take my time looking around - it could be finished faster than that. Would I say it's worth 15 bucks for such a short experience?  + Well it does keep your nerves on edge, since you really never know what's going to happen.  + The individual stages aren't even close to repetitive other than in an archetype sense, which is not bad at all. +/- The graphics are sort of lousy, but you get the sense that the world you find yourself in is the cause of those lousy graphics, so in retrospect, the graphics are 'right'.  And yes it's obvious that this is the case, not too difficult to tell.+/- As puzzler-type games go, this one's more about the ambience than the difficulty - you'll not have much of a problem figuring the game out, which may suck for some who are in it for a thoughtful challenge but for me, that was just right.  I have about as much patience for figuring out puzzles in games as... mm you know what I don't even have the patience to think of something clever to say there.+++ Creepy!!+ Hey, it's got a storylineSo 15 bucks?  It may be short but it's like one of those international grocery stores... it has the variety of a large store crammed into a small space.  It's a fun, short, sometimes tense, sometimes thought-provoking, sometimes I-don't-know-WHAT experience that I'd say is worth a try even at 15 bucks.			"

												There are interesting ideas and in my short time with it nothing seems broken, but this game needs a lot of polish. The controls work fine, but sometimes don't feel great (I played with an Xbox 360 controller). For example, there are occasionally items you have to crouch down before you hit the action button to pick them up/activate/whatever. The problem is you have to HOLD the crouch button while you hit the action button, which means your left hand has to reach over and hit one of the facebuttons. It's awkward. There are things in the audio that bug me, like the small torches that light up an area. They sound like a much bigger fire than they actually are, and the sound zone around them is short and drops off quickly. When I absent-mindedly walked by a torch, I was startled because I suddenly heard a big fire and didn't know where it was from (it didn't register in my mind until a few seconds later that the big fire sound was connected to this small fire). There was also a cut scene that played after the school memory where the the audio seemed way too quiet compared to the rest of the game. The art is competent, but the cutscene art style feels strange juxtaposed to the darker mood of the rest of the game. It's not cohesive.I've played through three ""memories"" (think ""levels"") and I want to like the game, but it just needs more polish. As it stands now, it seems like an awesome student project or a demonstration, but I don't think it's ready for primetime. If there's ever a major update that adds some polish, I'd love to come back to it.			"

												Not bad, but not great, Master Reboot is an interesting game with a few flaws. Master Reboot has a cool cyber world aesthetic and some unique puzzles though they can be very unfair at times (I'll explain later), and has an interesting story to it. In Master Reboot there is a world in a computer called the Soul Cloud, A place were people's memories are transferred before (or after I'm not sure) death so they will have a version of themselves left behind. I wont spoil anything because there is a lot to discover through all this, but when I reached the end I was left really confused. The game might pass as a horror game due to having jump scares regularly but it does not properly pace it self for that, In fact the game doesn't even get scary until near the end. I really need to address the puzzle design, at times it's straight forward and reasonable but other times entirely unfair and unclear. I had to use a walkthrough the first time in the school because I was expected to listen to a piano song and then replay it just by memorizing the sound of the notes. I really don't like to look up walkthroughs of games but sometimes I really have no choice, I'm not sure if that's my fault or the designers. I wish I could say that was the only time I had to use it but the games puzzle design constantly shifts from stupidly easy to just plain obnoxious. However despite the issues I have Master Reboot is an enjoyable game with a great atmosphere and fairly well present story.			"

												An excellent game, especially for Sleepers and Dreamers.  Hard to describe; you really need to experience it for yourself.  Graphics are a tad outdated, though that's only an issue for the casual and twitchy gaming crowds.  Concept is fantastic, and the way the story unfolds was very pleasing.  Not sure why it has such a low Metacritic rating, though I suspect the lack of run-and-gunning would turn off todays admittedly more twitchy gamers.			"

												I bought this game during a sale and completly forgot about it till I was bored out of my mind and skimmed through my list.the concept instantly spoke to me and I remember why I bought it. When people die they get uploaded into a ""soul space"" their memory's and possibly themselves live on forever. And thats where you are. You find out what happened by finding blue rubber ducks which contain memories.The story is very good, the artstyle excellent, its very basic but it suits the world. And it can get quite creepy aswell. This is easily one of my favorite game of all time. 8/10!			"

												Having completed a full playthrough for my YouTube channel, I can honestly say the best word to describe Master Reboot would be ""imaginative,"" and that's a very good thing. It's not the next smash hit, nor is it the most entertaining thing I've ever played or even the best-written script, but it's not really meant to be any of those things; Master Reboot is a trip for the imagination, plain and simple.If you prefer subtle, well-faceted stories, action-packed or original gameplay, or are looking for a spine-chilling horror game, then Master Reboot is not the game for you. If, however, you want to enjoy an adventure in an admittedly rather linear but highly compelling setting of wild, stylized imaginings, then you could hardly make a better choice.			"

												If you could distill and bottle surreal-ness, this game is probably the closest thing you can get. The story and gameplay themselves are nothing to write home about, not bad but not great either. Given the world it sets up, the story could have been executed a lot better. The gameplay is also pretty standard for these sort of games, some of the puzzles were nice at least. What the game excels at is the sheer quality of the sets it shows you, the environments change dramatically  between memories while keeping the vibrancy and strangeness. Each memory is a sheer joy to look at and explore through. Even with the low quality assets that show up, it still manages to be a very pretty looking game. If anything, you should get this game as an experience.			"

												Initially, this game offers no clues as to what to expect. Of course theres plenty of reviews and videos and whatnot, but the game itself drops you into a strangely disturbing art deco style world and expects you to get on with it. This I think is beautiful and as you gradually gain tidbits of story and have your heart leap into your mouth a few times (particularly if you play with headphones in the dark), the immersion is complete. Contains, puzzles, monsters and psychotic computers, all the elements needed to keep you wanting to discover a little more as to 'what the hell?'. Also, you can play it in Welsh.			"

												This is... likely the weirdest game I've ever played. Entertaining? Not so much. What Master Reboot does is make your brain work - along with creepy and suggestive imagery. Very ambient, some jump scares... I could wax eternal in some pretentious rant about parables between the narrative and our growing dependence on social media and ""the cloud"", but meh... Yes, there is a story, but it's presented in a somewhat heady way - as with Myst, you need to piece the various bits and bobs together on your own; nothing is presented with absolute clarity and a thorough explanation.In a nutshell: Everything's colourful. Then everything's weird. Then you go all over looking for little blue rubber ducks. Then there are creepy little girls and teddy bears all around, then things get REALLY weird, weirder still (!), then there's an epic boss fight, and then it ends - and you just sit there wondering what the smurf just happened. On the whole, though, I actually recommend taking a look. You don't get games like this every day. Or every year. Or even every decade.(I personally didn't really care for the music or the artwork, but to each their own.)			"

												This first person adventure features a 5-ish hour long jouney into the memories of a dead person. An unnerving presence and an unfolding story of envy and vengeance make this worth playing. The cutscenes are basic, but the 3D worlds are simple yet beautiful, with lashings of TRON inspired scenery and snippets of twisted real-world scenes. The puzzles are many, but non-too challenging, yet entertaining and varied enough to keep the experience fun.Certainly worth a play if fancy a first-person game with a bit of a difference.			"

												3/5 starsA pretty good game all in all, don't take the ""horror"" genre of it as meaning much, its scary sure, but its more of an ""introducory horror game"", in other words, a good horror for those who don't play many horror games and/or aren't accustumed to particularly disturbing subject matter. Its definitely a sci-fi horror, as opposed to say a supernatural horror, you won't find demons or ghosts here. That being said, expect jump scare after jump scare.Any fan of series like Tron or The Matrix may find some of the plot rather familiar, but with its own unique taste for sure. The visual style of the game may not be the incredibly immersive HD high texture environment many of us are likely used to, but it certainly has its own unique charm.You are perhaps wondering, ""if you liked it so much why only 3/5?"" Well, its buggy, buggy as hell, BUGGY AS BLOODY HELL!!! To the best of my knowledge the development team are no longer working on this game, no updates/patches are planned, so basically you just have to be patient and occasionally a level may even need to be replayed to get past a bug.

												Although I finished the game, I don't reccomend it. Have you ever had an experience where you keep waiting for it to turn the corner? Master Reboot is like that; worse than simply being a bad game, it is an inconsistent game, which robs all the enjoyment you get by implanting a numb sense of deja-vu when the inevitable bug or slapdash scene overtakes you. The atmosphere is great, which is a big part of why I finished the game. The plot is mediocre, but gets better as you go. The drawn artwork is generic, and the 3D artwork is sometimes very cool (Fairground) and sometimes lacking (graveyard). The sound effects are where you see the quality decline - yes, there is a lot of good here, but there's also a lot of bad. Consider the Circus scene, where the sound of footsteps show up for no reason (no-one is there); you hear Kali thud as she lands in the trees near you, but she never does anything, so you start to ignore them after a while. Then there's the puzzles. Often, the puzzles exist just to give you something to do and make no sense (like the block puzzle in the Childhood memory). The plot pieces that the puzzles reveal often don't seem to be worth it. The risk/reward just isn't balanced well.The gameplay suffers as well. For instance, some sections are timed, but the game never tells you this. Some exits are only triggered if you behave the way that the game expects you to, and so if you think different, you will be stuck. Some scenes run on and on and on for no real reason. Worse, the restore points absolutely suck (consider the last scene), and as a result, you often have to repeat scenes again and again until you master some unimportant skill. Also, the achievements never register for Mac OS X.  The theme is a worthy one, but I just don't think Master Reboot really dealt with the theme seriously enough. The characters aren't explored deeply; when the game ends, you feel that you know only one or two of them well. That is a real missed opportunity. So while I did enjoy the theme and the atmosphere, the gameplay was incredibly frustrating and unnecessarily so. I don't want to be harsh, but I feel like the game could have used more dev time and definitely more QA time. Maybe Soul Axiom will be better, but I won't be hanging around to find out.			"

												When someone looks at the screenshots, they may think that Master Reboot has very little to offer visually but in reality what it offers is easily some of the most aesthetically varied environments I've come across in most games. Without getting into spoilers it will be hard to explain why Master Reboot is so enjoyable but here is my attempt.What the developers have achieved isn't a horror game in the normal sense. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that this is not a horror game at all, but it does successfully create an eerie atmosphere through the use of places which are quite unsettling due to how alien they appear. The game itself is set within a virtual world that seems somewhat warped, like a cross between Tron and Alice in Wonderland and that in itself makes it interesting to explore. The puzzles themselves won't tax your mental agility much but there are some really tricky ones that will require some concentration. The decrypting of the code in the graveyard is probably going to have you searching the internet though.From a narrative point of view, there is a plot behind all these places you explore. But you won't make much sense of it without looking for the Blue ducks scattered around the locations since these provide clues to the plot. While I did take a really good stab at collecting them all it seems that I missed some and didn't get to see the alternative ending, but I suspect I know what it is based upon the plot anyway. I would recommend anyone playing Master Reboot to spend some time collecting the ducks to figure out what is really happening in order to really appreciate what is happening. The plot is not handed to you on a silver platter, so you will need to piece together the information from the clues yourself to grasp the depth of the storyline.Overall I would say Master Reboot deserves more attention than it received. It's stylised visuals may not be cutting edge but they were perfectly matched to the storyline and setting of the game. The pacing of things was nice and the developers had a good stab at making the player uneasy but really could have avoided repeating the same cheap scares over and over to the point where they just didn't matter any more. There is some platforming sections here but they really aren't very difficult and they are rare compared to the other activities you will do. Much of Master Reboot is focussed on exploring the environments and solving the occasional brainteaser, so while you will see things like guns and axes in the screenshots you need to be aware that these are not used for fighting. This makes for a refreshing change of pace for an industry which insists on making 90% of its games focussed on overcoming challenges by bullet or blade.What a refreshing change to have games like Master Reboot around who strive to do things differently!

												The controls were poor. There was no indication of which thing you were actually clicking on in various puzzles, and little sense of distance for platforming. The puzzles themselves were mind numbingly tedious and the only horror element was the same jump scare over and over again. There could have been a decent horror story of losing loved ones to death, but it seems they forgot to give the player any reason to become attached to the characters, give them any personality, or write a story for that matter.

												it's an okay game, totally playable from start to finish. but i wouldn't recommend due to it being mediocre. despite having an intresting cyberpunk theme, it fails to do anything intresting with it, which was disappointing to say the least. And the game also suffers from an identity crisis, it seems like it's trying to be a horror game, a puzzle platformer, a walking simulator and a point and click all at the same time, and doesn't really succeed to be anything of that. However, if you are a sucker for cyberpunk like me, this game is neat to have in your collection.			"

												Sorry, can't recommend. I really wasn't feeling drawn to the experience from the start. I think it began losing me at the first cutscene with this god awful art that looked like it was done by a first year art student. I really think I would have been more receptive if they had skipped that entirely. I tried to give it the benifit of the doubt and kept going but the visuals continued to distract with their unconfident, amatuerish look. I had hoped that the first cutscene of terrible photoshop drawings would be the last but it appeared that they occur after every level once you get to the hub.On top of that, there were many cutscenes to highlight changes in the world that I could have naturally found through normal gameplay without taking the controls out of my hands. Not only did this element make possibly interesting events painfully obvious, but it was also incredibly jarring and completely removed me from the experience. I only got an hour in before it became unbearable to continue. I wish I could say something in favor of this game but I really can't. I'd suggest avoiding this one entirely, sorry devs...			"

My mother said to me, ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At the age of 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Great game. I love the aesthetic and the mysteriously unravelling storyline. It's a bit like the original half-life in that sense, that you as the main character start with no idea who you are or what's going on and it's up to you to explore to fill in the blanks.With a style resembling something like Tron mixxed with classic 90's low-poly VR worlds, the graphics of Master Reboot do well to immerse you in the game environment. Minimalistic, but consistant.Without spoiling anything, the game throws you, the player, into the 'soul cloud' where peoples conciousness can be uploaded. Chased by a rogue AI through the levels, you're tasked with exploring fragments of your past to uncover memories that piece your life back together.The game probably doesn't have much replay value beyond completing and finding all secrets, but still i highly recommend picking this up even at it's full $15 price.If anything, it's a unique first person advetnure that you might find yourself wanting to show off to other people			"

												The atmosphere is rather hit-and-miss, and the quality of the puzzles even more so. Some areas are pretty cool (such as the child's memory) but others are just silly (the park), and most of the puzzles can be divided into either ""read the author's mind"", ""search every inch of this area for something you can interact with, in the right order"", or ""blindingly obvious and unoriginal"". Oh, and it doesn't save your progress within an area; if you quit during the action sequence at the end be prepared to repeat all the puzzles.Overall it's not terrible, but there's a dozen other games that are better at each thing it's trying to do.

												Game titles that came by to my mind, when I started this game, were ""Tron 2.0"", ""Antichamber"", ""Amnezia"".The game narritive could be a bit blurry and weird at the beginning, but it make more sence as far as you progress. The important questions are raised. ""What is the soul?"", ""Memories are our treasure or a burden?"", ""Is there a live after death?"", ""How far will techology go?"", ""What exactly define us, as humans?"". I would highly reccomend you this game if you are into alternative and independent titles, this game is quite a journey. Another thing: I would not reccomend you to play it whole day, take breaks at least every 4 hours. It could be rather... Emotionally and mentally excausting after a while. But if you have a weakness for puzzles and existencial games, this game hit the jackpot.			"

												I really want to like this game. The atmosphere, art style, and concept are neat. The music also deserves special mention. However, the game falls completely flat in the gameplay category. Basically, you get to walk slowly around (often excessively large) levels, stopped by frequent puzzles which either make little to no sense, or end up being just ""collect these to unlock the door""-variety. I really need to point out how much not-fun I was having due to moving too slowly. Also, that trite jump-scare where the little girl jumps out of a locker or closet and grabs you gets more than boring, but actually predictable the third time it happens. Especially since you have to Button-Mash-To-Save-Your-Life®.It's plagued by flaws that make it feel like it was made by extremely inexperienced developers. For example: In one level you have a hammer, and see a broken section of wall. You broke similar broken sections with three hammer strikes. So you hit this one three times, and nothing happens. No special sound or particle effect, no change in the wall. Go ahead and hit it three more times, just for luck. Still nothing. You'll be stuck, trapped, respawning over and over (with a cutscene, to boot!) until you discover it inexplicably takes SEVEN hits to break this wall. As well as the next five walls straight behind it in identical-looking rooms. To top it off, after breaking the final wall, I took a look behind me to see if I missed anything. Upon turning around again, for no reason a door had silently closed at the exit, forcing me to redo the section yet again.As for those ""memorable moments"", the only things I can remember about the game are needlessly frustrating sequences like the above. I have to recommend against this game. Better luck next time, Wales Interactive. I hope you learn from your mistakes.			"

												Master reboot does nothing to justify it's price. It feels minimalist in terms of production, like it was a student project. While the story and visuals are interesting sometimes, the devs ruin it by going for a horror game style. I fail to understand why the devs would try horror without even meeting the its most minimal requirments. I realised that the devs were going for horror when they threw a jumpscare at me, i only realised it was a jumpscare after the fact because the atmosphere in the game is as lackluster as the art for the collectable photos.  also the lack of an options screen is annoying, even more so when you can't turn off the music in the childhood level. if your looking for a story driven first person puzzle game look far far away from master reboot.

												So I saw a lot of positive word on this game and thought I would give it a chance on sale. From the start, really bored with the graphics and the lack of any kind of drive or anything interesting happening to get me to go from space to space. I guess I'm just supposed to go. So I stopped playing. Finally, decided to give it another chance. There is a moment of something interesting when we get the nice little graphic telling us what's going on and then we're in this hub thing, which looks appropriately cyberspace-like. And then you enter these section puzzle areas. Why is this interesting? Why should I care? Please, give me a reason. I make it past one section, only to be stuck in this platform jumping thing with rising water level, sluggish movement, and randomly, we're supposed to find our way to the right jumps to get us high enough? After drowning repeatedly and being reset to the beginning of this level, my patience went to zero and I stopped. The graphics have a definite style, but a lot of it looks really amataurish, like it came out of my beginning level design class with more complete functionality, but about the same level of graphical capability. And the story or rather, lack of story... it just made for a really boring game. The concept deserves a better game than this. Not worth 5 bucks. If it were some free download, it might be interesting enough as a student thesis game or something. Then it would be like, wow, that's a cool final project. Well done. Anything else, there are so many better games out there to spend your time and money on.			"

The creativity and overall ambiance are just that good.The game does fall apart during the final chapter, though, switching over to jumping puzzles in first person, with a time limit, and a weapon control system that didn't quite work.  I'm not sure what happened there, because it didn't match the quality of the rest of the game.I want to go back and play it again, but stop playing after beating all the levels in the main ""town"" area.4/5 stars overall, with the understanding that the last level had issues, and that this is an indie title.I wouldn't call this ""horror.""  It has jump-scares in the first level, but those are rare throughout the game.			"

												Disclaimer: This game makes me nauseous. I've tried altering the settings, and I've managed to play a total of 15 minutes in two sessions. This is my impression on those 15 minutes. The remaining time I have logged is just dead time to get cards.It is certainly atmospheric. That is really its strongest point, and if you want nothing but a creepy game look no further. The whole asthetic is certainly cohesive, which makes me wish the art design was too. What I experienced of 'level' design was (mostly) competent though not compelling. The story and premise unfolds too gradually; the first two levels have zero context. Even after that I often found myself looking at things and thinking ""Why does this matter?"" My main gripe however is I found the controls clunky; it's not the best sign when your player gets immediately lost without you putting immpersion-breaking icons over everything. After my third death to a pursuing teddy bear I decided the game was not worth my physical illness.			"

												This is yet another game where the bizarre aesthetics and off-beat graphics are the only redeeming feature. The colour scheme and simple design is really effective: the world of Master Reboot is colourful but manages feels off-putting and alien on the whole. It's really well done and a shame that the gameplay lets it down.While the levels do mix up the presentation and try to keep things interesting they are hampered by the gameplay boiling down to ""hit a button when you see the hand pop up"" or ""solve this♥♥♥♥♥♥easy puzzle"". Adventure/Platformer with a bunch of crap to collect. There is apparently a story which you piece together through the levels and from finding hidden ducks while you're searching for the other things you're collecting.In the end Master Reboot is just really boring. The story is deliberately fragmented (you're exploring memories!) and I imagine there's some kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥twist at the end that was hastily ejaculated into the script by the writer at 5am in the midst of a Robitussin epiphany. Decent bundle fodder, and probably worth putting an hour into it to see if it's your thing.			"

												Master Reboot seems to be more ambitious than anything. It bills itself as an atmospheric indie horror game and for the most part hits the mark.The problem is, the developers seems to have vastly underestimated the importance of graphics and sound. Of course graphics always come second to actual gameplay, but the problem is that horror games in particular rely heavily on visuals and audio to create atmosphere, sensations and so forth whereas Master Reboot doesn't seem to recognize that need.The models used for every object and character have clearly visible polygons (though to be honest, this is easily forgivable), the cutscenes look very cheap and the lighting appears to have been used very incorrectly - At one point I was confronted with a jump-scare that would've been far more effective if not for the fact that the hallway it occurred in was colorful and very brightly lit. No sense of forthcoming dread at all.Master Reboot isn't bad. It just feels as though very little was invested in it, and as a result I have a lot of trouble investing myself in the game.			"

												Surreal and minimalistic adventure puzzle game. As someone who has played every F.E.A.R. game, I couldn't help but to see how a couple levels in this game drew a bit of horror influence with the ghost-like girl running across the screen into darkness. There are a few jump scares. So if you have a fragile heart, then don't play this game unless you have someone else play this with you. The game puts you in a hub-like area, where there are 3 groups of doors, each containing 3~4 doors that each lead to a unique environment and puzzle to solve. I won't disclose what the puzzles are, but they are quite intuitive but a little too easy. There's a lot of people concerned about the scariness of the game, so I'll say that the airplane and the hospital levels are the only levels you should really be ready for. My personal favorite level was the airplane. Without revealing too much, the level for me was the spookiest yet also the most memorable, the way the level was designed. It gives a claustrophobic feeling with nowhere to escape, stuck inside with no one but an unknown ghostly figure that tries to eliminate you.The game will take around 4 hours to complete. I would wait for a sale. $5 makes more sense, but considering how experimental and cleverly-designed this game is, this is an indie game that deserves some recognition. (note: there are sites that sell Steam keys, and sites that look professional, but most of the times they are a scam. and if they do happen to give you a valid Steam key, then your account will be banned from Steam for breaking the ToS.)Gameplay: 7/10Story: 9/10Sound: 5/10Quality: 9/10Level Design: 8/10Visuals: 9/10Overall: 8/10 - Buy on Sale			"

												I actually like this game way more than I thought I would going into it. It's not really as much of a horror game as you might believe it to be. The whole game gives off a bit of a creepy vibe, but nothing really horrific actually happens. There's one or two jump scares that happen during the course of the game, but really, you're mostly trying to piece together the backstory of what you're even doing. Everything takes place inside of human memories uploaded into a computer, so you go to some dark places, but the game isn't made to just scare you like a conventional horror game would be.			"

												Pros:- Graphics are great and minimalistic with great effects.- Controls are responsive and simple.- Very interesting milieu/theme.- Just overall brilliant level design.Cons:- That thing is horrifying. (A character(?) that seems to appear now and then in (at least) the early parts of the game)- Options menu could've been a bit more detailed, but this is minor.Very good, might try to get a little further in the game one day, when I've manned up.

												Well, just a couple of points that stood out for me personally. Keep in mind that I finished the game :)- Graphics are awful (I mean from the technical standpoint - this could have been done in year 2000 using the existing technology without any problem); saying they're like that because that was the artistic intention, etc., makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. This is simply lazy and seriously harms the game.- Only some puzzles are good. However, at least they're varied :/- Platforming is ok, some frustrating bits, surely, but not that bad as some other big name platformers.- There's horror (ok, scares). If you hate horror games (like I do), you will be scared a few times, maybe even turn out the sound. Not for small kids!- Story is ok. Even good, actually.			"

												This is a really interesting game  It is quite unlike anything else I have ever played, both in terms of form and content.  The art style is simple, but effective within the context of the game.  The first person puzzle/survival horror playstyle works well too.  But let's break this down into pros and cons, shall we?Cons:Now, I know I referred to Master Reboot as a survival horror game above, but if you go into this game expecting something so scary that it will keep you up at night, you will be dissppointed.  I did not personally find the game to be all that frightening.  Seren is really not all that intimidating.  At first she is a bit unsettling, but that is about it.  If she does manage to kill you, you just respawn and try again.  There is seldom a real penalty for dying, save a loss of time.  After a while, she becomes more of a nuisance than anything else.  If you want horror that will make you cringe, Outlast is the game for you.Most of the puzzles are fairly simple.Also, I did encounter occasional real-life glitches, but nothing game-breaking.Pros:The style is really beautiful and creative, and the music works well with the atmosphere.Interesting locations.Fascinating story.However, where this game really shines is in how it presents its story.  Unlike most games, there is very little dialogue.  Most of the information you recieve is either through pictures or various notes.  It is then up to the player to peice the story together.  These bits of information are acquired by finding the collectables.  Now, in most games, the collectable-related side-quests annoy me, since finding a bunch of nick-nacks just for the sake of gaining 100% completion feels hollow--like a weak attempt by the developers to increase play time.  However, in this game, each item is a peice of the story.  If you are interested in finding out about what happened, it is in your best interest to find the collectables.Overall, this game is a really fun, interesting experience.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try.			"

												A compelling story in a fun puzzle game with moments of pure running panic.  Unfortunately gameplay is severely  hampered by an inability to remap the input keys.  I might be able to finish the final scene if I could use my mouse and sprint at the same time, but, as a leftie, that's not possible.  I'm frustrated that something so simple makes this game impossible to finish.I'd recommend it - if you're right handed.			"

												I loved this game. It was a blast to play (even if I needed some help in places ^^; ). The environments in this game were amazing and spooky (Carnival, School, Hospital, Kids room). Also, the neon lights and circuits everywhere were a very nice touch. The story is interesting. You work at a company called Mysteri and as an employee it is your job to traverse the soulcloud, a cyberlandscape made from the memories of people. You have to protect these memories from an intruder. You travel through a bunch of different memories picking up bits of the story as you go. My only complaint is that in some places it was a bit tricky to figure out what you needed to do. I definitely recommend this game. Can't wait till I get a chance to play Soul Axiom. I did a playthrough so here is a link if you are interested. Any critique is welcome.

												This game is just.  .  . Strangely addicting.It pulls you in, and once you ARE in, it's rather hard to get out. The graphics are simple, they aren't perfect, but not trash neither. You are in a world where death isn't such a huge barrier anymore, but something goes wrong and they have to reboot, causing the strange 'little girl' you will find in the levels. For me, in the plane, if you look at her legs, you can tell she's not human. It should be obvious she's a robotic device. And. . . The graveyard is FREAKY. For me. If you get rather scared easily, there should be a huge BEWARE sign all over this game for certain levels. Luckily, it also provided the players a break. For me, they were the beach and the hub itself. There, safety was obvious. Until the robotic girl just HAD to come along on the boat and ruin the beach. Sorry, ahead of myself, no?There are puzzles as well. (I can imagine some of your groans. Hush, now!) They're simple! I finished them easily, they were a little random but still fun. All in all, it's a good game FOR the right gamers. Some just don't think it's good enough, which is fine. It's all opinions nowadays, isn't it? If you're considering this game, watch perhaps the first episode of a Let's Play. That will aid in your decision. I hope this did as well.			"

												Not a bad game. The art/design of the game fits very well with the story. The story is told mostly through short drawn cut scenes or momento/items you can collect throughout the game.

												One of the more intriguing yet frustrating games I've played in quite some time. Yes, the visual design, level design, and gameplay mechanics lack polish, and the story can be difficult and deliberately confusing in places, but when it's good it's *really* good, and made me repeatedly come back for more. Whether you'll enjoy the game essentially boils down to how willing you are to forgive its negative aspects (and believe me, there are many). I personally found the world and overarching story fascinating, so I was more than willing to wade through some of the crapper puzzles and laughably bad animations just so I could delve further into the Soul Cloud and Astrid/Madison/David's story. If you have enough patience and can get the game for a bit cheaper than the full price, then I highly recommend playing this. A flawed gem.			"

												Master Reboot is a very interesting... attempt. There seems to be a lot of potential in it - bold color palettes, ambitious storyline and delivery method, extremely varied gameplay mechanics and environments.Unfortunately it crumbles under an amateur delivery - the aesthetic choices are surprisingly poor, the modeling - weak, sound design sounds very ""stock'y"" and constant hijacking of the camera whenever the game wants to emphasize something - disorienting and frustrating.I really wanted to like this game, but had to put it down and uninstall after just a few levels, unwilling to fight against the handicaps.

												First the good. The idea behind this game is interesting and the visuals are very nice. The feel of the game is very good, quite scary and futurisitc. Too bad the game, while having a bit of athmospheric scare to it, relies almost exclusively on jumpscares.However, the gameplay is quite frustrating. While the puzzles are very simple (too simple), they still manage to make the game feel very grinding. Missing a duck means doing the whole level over, cutscenes and all, and instead of being fun and exciting over finding out more about the world, it just makes you feel annoyed and not wanting to bother.In short, the gameplay feels monotone and frustrating after a few levels.I reccomend looking at a playthrough of it on youtube rather than spend money and time playing it yourself.

												Master Reboot is a mixture of exploration, puzzle solving and survival.  The basic premise of the game is that in the future, people can upload their dead relatives' memories to an interactive computer system, ""the Cloud"" where they can access them through a computer and share treasured moments etc. When things inevitably go wrong the creators of the Cloud send the game's Heroine to investigate.Much about the setting can be learned along the way and if you pick up all the source information scattered around the game the truth about the Cloud and its conception in the ""real world"" becomes chillingly clear.Puzzles are fairly simple for the most part, more than a distraction but by no means the defining feature of the game, as you also have to deal with occasionally quite terrifying manifestations of the Cloud/Memories all the while trying to make sense of what you find along the way.Visually Master Reboot has a slightly Manga-esque vibe; the design has an atmospheric, dream-like quality that draws the player in, slowly at first but after about a half-hours worth of play I was totally hooked.  If I were forced to compare this to anything I would say it is like the written fiction of William Gibson and Philip K♥♥♥♥♥♥ but with a distictly Anime, Ghost in the Shell style visual aesthetic.  Overall Master Reboot is an excellent piece of interactive storytelling.  It is relatively short, so I wouldn't recommend paying full price for the game this long after release; however if it's on offer snap it up, it's well worth your time.			"

												Where is the ""meh"" button when you need it.It looked and sounded great on paper. It's a very simple game with unqiue theme around a vague story with incredibly simple mechanics and puzzles while enshrouded in a plethora of glow and blur effects. I'd say the minimalist visuals attracted me the most about the game and little else.I beat the game quite quickly - you mostly run around [until your virtualized character runs out of breath *shrug*] clicking all of the blue-glowing rubber ducks. And then when you run out of ducks to click it usually meant there are some other, vibrantly glowing thing you are supposed to click instead. I enjoyed the theme and the simple mechanics, but the whole time I had a poor understanding of who I was playing as and what I was doing - by the time I worked out the ""who I was"" part, the game was nearly over. Even then I still wasn't sure what I was doing or why I was even here in Tron-land aside from the chronology of seemingly unrelated ""memories"" I was collecting. I would guess that the final-boss character has something to do with the ""Soul Cloud"" having errors, but that wasn't ever clarified [that I saw]. The creepy, threat messages left by the ""Goddess of Death"" were never really explained either.Starting from the beginning, someone dies and you become Tron. Your purpose is to find the exit door (blue cube thing) to each level that you begin for no reason other than having a door that you can enter. When you have gone through all the doors, you will have accumulated enough ""memories"" to piece together a vague story about some common tragedies and something-something-something that you won't realize has anything to do with you until someone calls you by name for the first time near the end. And then after that you realize, as an audience, that you really didn't care about the story anyways and continue looking for that damn exit door.Some better character development for the protagonist would have really helped the game.Actually, the game would have been more interesting from the perspective of Seren [seren.exe], I think.Speaking of, I'd say that the only real fright value in this game is that the glowy-eyed Seren might occasionally try and make you jump in your seat a little. It's a game suitable for most ages, I'd think.Oh - And I'll give a Recommend to the game only because between a scale of 1 to 10, the game sits at least somewhere over 5.1 - or something. Like I said, where is the ""meh"" button when you need it.			"

												I feel like this game is still in Alpha. It needs a lot of polishing. I read a lot of reviews about interesting plot and spooky this and that but I just can't bring myself to play far enough into the game to figure out what any of the plot is. Not because I'm impatient, but because I'm battling the interface and facing rendering issues along the way. I had to try several keys to figure out that the first one was enter, then space is jump and crouch is.... C? Then I tabbed out to answer a FB message and when I came back I was stuck staring at the sky through a tree and the ground never came back. My computer isnt amazing, but an i5 with a gig graphics card should be able to handle this game. I got this game in a bundle but I was pretty shocked when I saw it was listed for $15. I would be majorly peeved if I'd paid that for a game that felt incomplete. I would really love to give this game another shot... after a UI designer goes over it and some fresh eyes come in to clean up the graphics.			"

												This is a really interesting game  It is quite unlike anything else I have ever played, both in terms of form and content.  The art style is simple, but effective within the context of the game.  The first person puzzle/survival horror playstyle works well too.  But let's break this down into pros and cons, shall we?Cons:Now, I know I referred to Master Reboot as a survival horror game above, but if you go into this game expecting something so scary that it will keep you up at night, you will be dissppointed.  I did not personally find the game to be all that frightening.  Seren is really not all that intimidating.  At first she is a bit unsettling, but that is about it.  If she does manage to kill you, you just respawn and try again.  There is seldom a real penalty for dying, save a loss of time.  After a while, she becomes more of a nuisance than anything else.  If you want horror that will make you cringe, Outlast is the game for you.Most of the puzzles are fairly simple.Also, I did encounter occasional real-life glitches, but nothing game-breaking.Pros:The style is really beautiful and creative, and the music works well with the atmosphere.Interesting locations.Fascinating story.However, where this game really shines is in how it presents its story.  Unlike most games, there is very little dialogue.  Most of the information you recieve is either through pictures or various notes.  It is then up to the player to peice the story together.  These bits of information are acquired by finding the collectables.  Now, in most games, the collectable-related side-quests annoy me, since finding a bunch of nick-nacks just for the sake of gaining 100% completion feels hollow--like a weak attempt by the developers to increase play time.  However, in this game, each item is a peice of the story.  If you are interested in finding out about what happened, it is in your best interest to find the collectables.Overall, this game is a really fun, interesting experience.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try.			"

												'Master Reboot' is a near perfect blend of exploring, puzzle solving and action with an ominous and eerie tone. The minimalistic visual style and smart sound design give a distinct feel to the game at once, and the jump scares really work when you least expect them in the 'cute' settings. Each section is divided as a fragment of a memory that unveils the story. Besides the fact that it lets you assemble the puzzle at your own leisure it also works great for casual gaming as you can play a memory or two and pick it up later without feeling you interrupted anything. This first person adventure seems perfect for oculus rift compatibility to make it the ultimate immersive experience in the soul cloud, if that ever happens.			"

												Excellent indie walking simulator, with light horror elements. It was very atmospheric and had excellent art direction within the gameplay and environments, with intelligent scare tactics. Puzzles would occasionally fall flat, but most could be brute forced in a reasonable amount of time. My biggest criticism would have to be the art choices in the cinemas, which looks like Tokyopop faux-anime. It was somewhat jarring and clashed with the actual gamespace as juvenile and unpolished. Good game overall, especially if you're Welsh. How many games have native support for the Welsh?			"

												A puzzle game where you have no idea which objects interacts with another, and what the result will be? It's not a puzzle if I just have to try everything to find a logic.

												This game is made in a simple style, and there's not much you can do. However, simplicity can just as, if not more, beautiful as complexity.It's a neat little game with a very interesting story with two possible endings. The story is broken up into little pieces you must find throughout the game. It's okay to miss a few (unless you want achievements); most are out in the open. You can play through the game without ever looking at the story pieces, but there's not much of a point in doing that; this is a story-driven game with puzzles and limited exploration.I recommend it and all its complex simplicity.

												This game is just.  .  . Strangely addicting.It pulls you in, and once you ARE in, it's rather hard to get out. The graphics are simple, they aren't perfect, but not trash neither. You are in a world where death isn't such a huge barrier anymore, but something goes wrong and they have to reboot, causing the strange 'little girl' you will find in the levels. For me, in the plane, if you look at her legs, you can tell she's not human. It should be obvious she's a robotic device. And. . . The graveyard is FREAKY. For me. If you get rather scared easily, there should be a huge BEWARE sign all over this game for certain levels. Luckily, it also provided the players a break. For me, they were the beach and the hub itself. There, safety was obvious. Until the robotic girl just HAD to come along on the boat and ruin the beach. Sorry, ahead of myself, no?There are puzzles as well. (I can imagine some of your groans. Hush, now!) They're simple! I finished them easily, they were a little random but still fun. All in all, it's a good game FOR the right gamers. Some just don't think it's good enough, which is fine. It's all opinions nowadays, isn't it? If you're considering this game, watch perhaps the first episode of a Let's Play. That will aid in your decision. I hope this did as well.			"

												I actually like this game way more than I thought I would going into it. It's not really as much of a horror game as you might believe it to be. The whole game gives off a bit of a creepy vibe, but nothing really horrific actually happens. There's one or two jump scares that happen during the course of the game, but really, you're mostly trying to piece together the backstory of what you're even doing. Everything takes place inside of human memories uploaded into a computer, so you go to some dark places, but the game isn't made to just scare you like a conventional horror game would be.			"

												Surreal and minimalistic adventure puzzle game. As someone who has played every F.E.A.R. game, I couldn't help but to see how a couple levels in this game drew a bit of horror influence with the ghost-like girl running across the screen into darkness. There are a few jump scares. So if you have a fragile heart, then don't play this game unless you have someone else play this with you. The game puts you in a hub-like area, where there are 3 groups of doors, each containing 3~4 doors that each lead to a unique environment and puzzle to solve. I won't disclose what the puzzles are, but they are quite intuitive but a little too easy. There's a lot of people concerned about the scariness of the game, so I'll say that the airplane and the hospital levels are the only levels you should really be ready for. My personal favorite level was the airplane. Without revealing too much, the level for me was the spookiest yet also the most memorable, the way the level was designed. It gives a claustrophobic feeling with nowhere to escape, stuck inside with no one but an unknown ghostly figure that tries to eliminate you.The game will take around 4 hours to complete. I would wait for a sale. $5 makes more sense, but considering how experimental and cleverly-designed this game is, this is an indie game that deserves some recognition. (note: there are sites that sell Steam keys, and sites that look professional, but most of the times they are a scam. and if they do happen to give you a valid Steam key, then your account will be banned from Steam for breaking the ToS.)Gameplay: 7/10Story: 9/10Sound: 5/10Quality: 9/10Level Design: 8/10Visuals: 9/10Overall: 8/10 - Buy on Sale			"

												I loved this game. It was a blast to play (even if I needed some help in places ^^; ). The environments in this game were amazing and spooky (Carnival, School, Hospital, Kids room). Also, the neon lights and circuits everywhere were a very nice touch. The story is interesting. You work at a company called Mysteri and as an employee it is your job to traverse the soulcloud, a cyberlandscape made from the memories of people. You have to protect these memories from an intruder. You travel through a bunch of different memories picking up bits of the story as you go. My only complaint is that in some places it was a bit tricky to figure out what you needed to do. I definitely recommend this game. Can't wait till I get a chance to play Soul Axiom. I did a playthrough so here is a link if you are interested. Any critique is welcome.

												Initially this game won me over in the first half hour, but sadly soon spiraled into a rabbit hole of disappointment.   There's a lot to like about Master Reboot.  Mainly the atmosphere and the story as you can make it out.  The game itself is broken into many set pieces which initalliy played like a variety of large scale minigames.  This I really liked in the beginning until I started to realize that the variety was thin and it was essentialy the same scavenger hunt just in a different location usually with a gimmick to spice it up....find the three things in an oversized child's room.....find the three things on a plane while hiding from a spooky flight attendant of death.....find the three things in a hospital with a flashlight....find the three things using a metal detector..... you get the point. That sound design was pretty bad to the point of painful in some instances....kinda laughable in others (shoot some bottles at the carnival and you'll know what I mean.)  The controls however are what ended up killing the entire experience for me.  Movement is clunky which is even more of a negative considering the game relies pretty heavily on first person platforming in several parts.  Now combine this with a rage inducing bug plaguing the game that causes the controls to stick in one direction (usually left for me,) making you to run constantly into walls or off of platforms.  After replaying the finale of the game (a rather long timed platforming bonaza) and failing three times due to the control issues, I flipped off the screen and decided that even though I was seconds from completion, it just wasn't worth the trouble.

There are times I felt happy or sad in respose to the locations I was exploring.As a 3D puzzle platformer, it's not really hard but has some interesting puzzles in it.So, have at it!			"

												Master Reboot is an atmospheric game about the singularity-well, that, and one woman's quest to regain her memories and find out what's going on. You are a person who is part of the Soul Cloud, an initiative to preserve memories and souls, essentially, in a digital cloud. Things aren't all that well, though, because there is a mysterious digital girl who is trying to kill you.How does it play? It's a first-person exploration-type game, something I think a lot of people are familiar with by now. You wield ""weapons"" in a few instances, but most of the gameplay is exploring, solving puzzles, and doing the occasional other action like sneaking around or doing a QTE-and this is actually where my criticisms of the game begin.There's a few moments that can be frustrating for players: there's a few puzzles that are confusing as hell or require you to be really good at memorizing things. There was one QTE that took me like four tries because the controls weren't perfectly intuitive. Near the end, I found myself looking up a walkthrough.This does not make a strong case for the game, so what does it have going for it? Nice atmosphere, interesting level designs, a plot of at least decent quality (with some tear-jerker elements), nice 2D-animated cutscenes here and there, a slight horror element (very slight), and just a general air of creativity. For a game about the singularity, it's a good fit for the concept.I would recommend this game, but it's not something I'd play through twice. Still, if you find a hankering for digital-soul stuff, do check this out.			"

												As much as I'd like to recommend this game, there is so much that I take issue with that I cannot really suggest buying it. While the premise of the game is interesting, it lacks to polish, visual consistency, and precise controls to be entirely enjoyable. Environments and character models look very clunky and rough, and while some of this can be attributed to the visual stlye, some of it is simply a product of poor production. Furthermore, the illustrations in-game have little to do visually with the style of the game, and it's odd to see such convincing art on the store page while the art actually used in-game is just so generic.Though this game does well to build tension, deliver jumpscares, and create a sense of dread, performance issues and bugs, combined with clunky controls, really hinder this game's chance for success.

												My first impressions of Master Reboot…This is not really a review, just my first impressions of Master Reboot.  The game ran great in full screen resolution set to 1920x1080 for the first two memories, but after that, it ran terrible and started freezing and skipping frames.  Also the sound started popping in and out.  This game doesn't seem to be optimized for Mac's.  I even tried lowering the resolution but some parts of the game just are too convoluted and needs to be optimized better.  It really takes away from the whole immersive experience.  I ended up quitting because of this stupid platforming part in the game!  I was doing fine and all of a sudden, I had to do every thing all over again! It's weird too, because you don't really need to do much when platforming, but initiate the jumps.  It's fairly automatic.  I don't know how I ended up back on the bottom.  Anyway it was frustrating, so I quit playing.  Upon quitting the game, it crashed hard!  I had to force quit the game and force quit Steam to get completely out.Anyway, on a positive side, the game is pretty trippy and has some creepy effects and atmosphere.  It is unlike any other game I have ever played and sometimes has some very cool atmosphere.  It has a very retro and a sometimes Tron-ish/Matrix-ish (the movies) feel to it.  I only played the beginning and four memories.  I will continue to play, but some of the puzzles are really dumb and frustrating!  The gameplay can get stupid at times too, because lack of direction and dumb platforming sections.  At times, you will be shaking your head and rolling your eyes saying to yourself; ""what were the dev's thinking of?""Some people will absolutely love this game just for the atmosphere alone.  I have not gotten to the real scary parts yet and some of the memories really were a real pain to get through.  What is nice, if you don't want to finish a memory, you can leave and go back later.  The school memory is tough and sometimes a bit stupid!  I left and will go back later to finish it.  I do like the game enough so far to recommend it, but only on sale!I may update this later.  I really can't give a fair review based on the limited time I have spent.  Just know that this game is very different than most other games I have played and has a charm to it that may attract some gamers, but drive others away from the game.  The graphics are not all that great but fit the game well.  The sound is creepy and sets the mood for most of the memories just fine.My main complaint is that sometimes the game with start running terrible for no reason.  Some of the memory levels are tiny and should run much better than they do.  Even when the lighting is low and the levels are dark, it still can run terrible for no reason.  Just all of a sudden you go from 60 fps to 1 fps!  It's frustrating at the least!Here are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8.

												It's alright if you just want a game that will make you think into space for what the game offers..... Too many puzzles also, so if you are young then you will not appreciate the game.			"

												It’s alright but it’s nothing special. The story is cool but I feel like the writing kinda fell flat at points. While the gameplay parts looked fine this game really needs a kick in the♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to the cutscenes because they look like something out of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flash animation. The actual gameplay is okay, it’s a puzzle game but the hardest puzzle in the game is only hard because it’s time consuming. Overall it's still enjoyable despite it’s flaws.			"

												I like it! It had great atmosphere and the levels were pretty neat, as is the artistic style. My only real complaint with it, is that some of the scares you can see coming. One of those, ""Gee, I wonder what's going to happen if I do this? Oh, I totally didn't see that coming.. *cough couch*"" Aside from that it was really good and well worth your time.			"

												Before anything, I would like to say that this game is beyond anything I have ever experienced in my lifetime and should be played by all regardless what genre you're into. Now for my review. You play as Madison, who is on a journey to understand what has happened to the Soul Cloud. The Soul Cloud is a program in which the intention is to allow family and friends of the deceased to relive that person's memory. It's sort of like Assassin's Creed with the Animus. Except Desmond never personally knew the Assassins he was related to. Anyways, the game is entirely in first person perspective. The main idea is to relive memories in order to unravel the deeper mystery with lots of puzzle solving, platforming, and some horror elements added to the mix. The game runs pretty well on my Macbook Air but I did notice some small graphical, such as framerates which wasn't that bad, and major graphical glitches in terms of the environment. For instance, there is a level which features a county fair of some sorts which is seen in the pictures before buying this game (the one with the ferris wheel). In that level, it is supposed to be night time from what I gathered seeing lets plays and reviews. But when I was on that level, there was no night but instead, felt like it was morning. In other words, that level that was supposed to be darker and spookier, was bright as day. Like a sunshine in the Mad Max apocalypse world. It also happened again with a level which has you on a beach. You are supposed to see sunshine from a sunset but there was no sky when I played on the Macbook Air. Instead, there was blackness that substituted to all areas of the sky. The ground was visible, chairs were visible, and other things were visible but no way did I see a sky. Just the color black. Other than those instances, I really enjoyed this game. It had great puzzle solving, a cyberpunkish atmosphere, some good horror elements, and a memorable antagonist. The environments looked unique and fresh. It had done so much right and very little wrongs. I am glad this is in my library and the achievements will keep me occupied for awhile. Overall, it's a fun and great experience to be had by all. Heck if this was a physical release, I'd put my money down for it to be a part of my collection. My only recommendation if you wish to play it is that you avoid playing it on your Macbook Air. Use your Windows based PCs instead to play this gem.			"

												I usually avoid all games with horror elements (coward), but this was just too good not to finish once I got a hang of it. It has a really nice storyline and feeling. Would recommend to anyone in interests of horror/scifi/platformer.			"
