												Great game, awesome soundtrack.Now with widescreen and gamepad supportBuy it, do not look at metascore, highly underrated game :)I dont like hip-hop/rap at all, and I am neutral to graffiti/parkour culture. But game perfectly express and show the atmosphere of these subcultures with awesome soundtrack, voice acting and cut-scenes. Yes, the game tecnically not so good ( ""torn"" animation, ugly models and flickering textures and etc), but unique style of this game overcomes most of disadvantages. I think this game deserves at least 8/10			"

												An amazing game, a rare treat on steam, if you are into graffiti art this game is for you. This game has some graffiti artists such as COPE2, OBEY, FUTURA, SEEN, T-KID, and SMITH (they play as themselves) and many more artist that are featured. This game also has a great cast such as Talib Kweli, Adam West, Brittany Murphy (R.I.P), Charlie Murphy, Geogre Hamilton, Giovanni Ribisi, Rosario Dawson, The RZA, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, MC Serch, and Andy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Original music by The RZA and RJD2. Gameplay is dated. The story fits with the game and does not feel like a waste of good talent. The graphics do not look bad ps2 quality. The music and the art is true to the graffiti lifestyle. This game is fun and may even inspire some to make art as it did for me. This game works best with a Xbox controller and is working fine on windows 8.1. Thanks to publisher Devolver Digital for bringing this game back.			"

												I played Getting Up long time ago, but I remembered that there was not a game like this one. It is quite unique mixture of platforming/climbing + fighting the enemies using your combos and weapons + graffiti + some stealth actions.Pluses:+ very interesting story. You play as Trane who wants to become famous, to get up, but later you get into political intrigues and scandals and become a rebel!+ Graffiti! There are lots of styles to choose from.+ Atmosphere of anti-utopian city. There are guards and patrols who will shoot or try to apprehend you as soon as they spot you.+ Music! It is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Songs vary from hip-hop to hard rock!+ CGI cutscenes. There aren't many of them, but they are very well done.+ Voice actors. Rosario Dawson, Giovanni Ribisi, Brittany Murphy and many other famous people gave their voices to different characters.Minuses:- Not very comfortable controls. Your character sometimes just doesn't want to do what you want him to do. And yes, use gamepad. It's just better.- Stealth. I love stealth games such as Splinter Cell and Deus Ex, but here it is just poorly executed. It is not obligatory, but you won't survive otherwise.All in all, solid 9 out of 10! Try it.			"

												Graffiti culture par excellence! This is what Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure really contains. Under the supervision of Marc Eckō, creator of the worldwide known brand Eckō, was this masterpiece of graffiti history designed. Underlined by the beats of hiphop culture and smooth classics you are painting the streets and buildings of the city ""New Radius"" with your character Trane who lives for graffiti. You start with your blackbook which let you use different kinds of art like murals, roll-ups, wildstyles or freeforms like sticker, marker, poster. You try to fight yourself to a legend in graffiti. On your way to the top the story let you fight against the rival crew VanR and tells the you who inspired the graffiti culture (focused on New York).Some product placements like Nokia or Montana(cans) are not disturbing.You like graffiti and you like to colorize the city with your awesome blackbook designs, learn something about graffiti history and to beat some rivals by fighting?You gonna love this unique game like I do.

												Firstly, if you're going to get this:


Xbox 360 controller Mod 
A Guide for Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure
By: LinoleumKnife86

			The partial game pad controls for this game suck. So I used this to replace them and now my wired xbox 360 gamepad works great with this game.		


This was the game that first taught me about late fees - the hard way. When ""underrated/overlooked games"" come up, this is always in my top 3. Even if you didn't play it when it first came out, it's a good freedom fighter/uprising game; you might find the graffiti a little repetitive but there are so many (styles of) tags to spray, it's fine. The combat is simple but fun as well.Some of the textures have seizures, breaking the immersion and some of the sound is muffled (remember it is a port from an old♥♥♥♥♥game); the little I've played of it has shown the transition from obsolete console to pc to be good enough.Charlie Murphy plays a white guy.EDIT 1: The main gripe with this game is the camera: at times, it will be impossible to tell while spraying if you're nearing too much paint on one point. A buffing motion is the best way to combat potential dripping.The next gripe after this is the difficulty: I haven't found an ""Easy/Normal/Hard"" function... Thankfully. I forgot that the fun to be had in this game was only part of the reason I incurred such hefty late-fees back in 2006; the other part was how unforgiving the mobs of officers and gangers are. Especially when using a controller and the Power Move (in this case, X,X,hold X) can only be accomplished with X,X,mash X.I stand by this being one of my favorite (relatively obscure) games ever - very few games are as tense as this. Attempting (and no doubt failing) to sneak around enemies is the calm part; bombing active subway tunnels, the trains themselves, the side of a building being panned about with an authority's spotlight... You very well might get up due to adrenaline...EDIT 2: Amusement Pier: No Checkpoints 'til after you bomb the water tower. Be cautious, especially of the wonky camera angles while on the tower. Do not pick up the bolt cutters until you dispatch the Vandal Squad around the corner. As with most ports I've played, the dialogue within cutscenes likes to cut out or even get rearranged. One scripted line will be interrupted, to resume after what was supposed to be its rebuttal, to be interrupted again by the next line... All I can say is enable subtitles and read fast. Andy D-ick plays a fat-pig-female-cop.EDIT 3: Adam West plays the chief of police.			"

												Getting Up is a reference to getting your name up on the wall, not necessarily climbing up to huge heights to do so. But in Marc Ecko's new graffiti-laced action game, Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure, you'll have plenty of chances to do both. As a mixture of third-person fighting, Prince of Persia-like acrobatics, and frequent stops to get your name up on various surfaces around the near-future city of New Radius, there's a good deal of variety to the action in the game. But Getting Up has more to offer than just exciting gameplay. The story, dialogue, soundtrack, and look of the game all contribute a great deal to the flavor and authenticity of the package. The end result is an interesting and often-exciting adventure that should be appealing to most action-game fans, but will probably hold extra appeal if you're at all interested in graffiti and the culture surrounding it.The gameplay in Getting Up is usually structured like this: You get into a new area, and there are one or more primary targets that you have to get to and paint. There are also plenty of secondary surfaces that you can paint on to earn additional rep points, which figure into the game's unlockables.Painting in Getting Up is a pretty easy process that doesn't take a whole lot of skill. When you get near a surface that's part of an objective, an outline of your tag or piece will appear. You can change the size of it or cycle between a few different options, but then you hold down the paint button and go to work.While there's an element of stealth involved in Getting Up, there's still plenty of face-to-face, hand-to-hand combat to get through.Getting Up has a unique and effective visual style to it that gets across the look of urban decay extremely well while still doing justice to the enemy designs.If you happen to be at least slightly interested in graffiti, you'll get a lot out of the game. If you aren't, you'll probably still be able to appreciate a lot of what the game does, and you just might learn a little something along the way.Overall 7/10.			"

												I remember a long time ago when gamestop still sold PS2 games, I was looking through the PS2 games and for some reason, this game caught my eye. I had played the hell out of this game on PS2. One night I was looking through the new releases on steam and the second I saw this game, I bought it. This game was (and still is) one of the best games I have ever played and is one of my favorite games to this day. This game is absolutely amazing. The game has also aged quite well in my opinion and it stills looks good. 10/10 Buy it when it goes on sale or support the developers and buy it at full price because it is well worth the money!			"

												This game is an under appreciated gem of the PS2 era. It's a game that desperately needs a modern equivalent. If you're a fan of Hip-Hop or graffiti writing in general, this is a must own. The famous graff writer cameos, the RJD2 soundtrack, the Talib Kweli voice acting etc more than justify paying the on sale price of this game ($2.99) What others have said about the camera controls is correct. They are horrible and sometime glitch out. But nothing game breaking and if you're willing to play through that, with some .cfg tweaks, this game is more than playable. (I'm on Win10 btw and it runs perfectly)It has a great story, great soundtrack and a great artistic concept. Imho, it is definitely worth the time/money spent. Would love an HD remake or some new info on Getting Up 2!Other notable voices this game contains:Trane: Talib KweliKry-1: Giovanni RibisiTina: Rosario DawsonMayor Sung: George HamiltonPolice Chief Hunt: Adam WestVandal Squad Leader Aunt Beth: Andy♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Graffiti Legends:Cope2FuturaObey (Shepard Fairey)SeenT KidSane SmithEdit 11/23/16 Still needs a remake or sequel...

												Getting Up: One of the best games I've ever played. The game, basiclly, is a revolution game. its giving you so much things to think about. I also think that its the best game for Graffiti lovers. the battle parts on the game are also pretty cool, I have to admit, thanx to the game giving you a few ways to act while in combat, Gives you even more the feeling of a revolution game. The whole Graffiti thing is also one of the coolest ideas I ever heard for a PC video game, I actually have grown up with this game during the years and that is actuall one of the reason why I like art so much, especially Graffiti art. this game is the best. Highly recommended to everyone <3			"

												Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under PressureSo, when i saw this game on Steam it looked good. I was not sure if it was a game i would like since i have to admit the screenshots on the store page makes the game look a bit boring. But since it was on 75% off, i decided to buy it. Which was a wonderful idea. Because this game is not only fun, it also has a great story and some nice combat. It's right i did say combat. This game is quite old, and so are the graphics. But even though the graphics are old, the game is still worth buying. I never had the chance of trying this game when it came out, so i am glad i can now. I will give the game 8/10 for what i have tried so far.			"

												Great game, the controls are a bit weird I still cant figure out how to sneak without holding the shift key with my pinky and moving with my controller but that should be fixed if you get the 360 controller mod. This game is a must have if you're into graffiti or hip-hop at all, the music is great especially if you like Jet Set Radio but its not as fast paced. There are some missions that focus on stealth but most of the time I get lazy and just beat up everyone so I don't have to sneak. Graphics are a bit dated since it is a PS2 port but they're not that bad at all. Fun story, fun gameplay, great music, and amazing graffiti art. Definitely recommend this game.			"

Everything from fighting cops to looking through your blackbook for which pieces you want to bring to the next level. I have to say though, this game might not be your cup of tea if you are not into the graffiti culture. You have to respect graffiti to see the beauty in this game.			"

I could see myself messing with this game again in the future.Not sure how good the vs mode is since I didn't try it at all.

												Pretty cool game, get to tag everywhere and stuff, story takes around 9-10 hours to beat if you skip all the side stuff so it's pretty long but it's a bit of a buggy pc port, lot of graphical issues and it wasn't designed to run at 1080p so it looks a bit messy and the cutscenes are in 480p but it isn't too bad. There are some annoying missions that have difficult parts but nothing that a few tries won't solve. There are a few times where you have no idea where to go cause sometimes it isn't really pointed out which is frustrating. The keyboard controls aren't great but they are manageable, only real problem is when trying to walk across beams the controls are all messed up so that can be annoying. Aside from that there aren't too many problems and I'd say give it a try if you're into action/stealth games with tagging, gangs and rap music (It does have some dope tracks my negga) 7/10			"

												Moje česká recenze: http://www.playhit.cz/2014/12/marc-eckos-getting-up-contents-under-pressure/This game. I thought it's just mostly about vandalizing and fighting some gangbangers, but it goes far behind that. The controls are complicated, especially on controller and the game simply hates moving the camera. But the story will blow your mind. If you are a rebel in you heart, like myself, you're gonna love it. Corrupted goverment opressing the people of New Radius and you're here to prove that somebody is still free. The story gets even more personal as you learn about a member of your family being mixed in the politics, there will be even more motivation to put the mayor down. I like grafitti, some of them are truly an art. And it's still better to be tagging in this game than in your city. I gotta mention its awesome soundtrack, you'll be singing some of the songs a week later after finishing it. Let me warn you a little people, this is one of the old games that has checkpoints very far away from each other and jumping over buildings can't get by without an occassional fall, so prepare for a little bit of frustration and repettion. It really is worth it though. 8.5/10All I know is what I feelDeceive my eyes and distort what's realOnly truth will set you freeI'd rather die on my feet than to live on my kneesPharoahe Monch - Book of Judges (Marc Eckō's OST)			"

												I feel very conflicted if I should recommend this game or not.It's the most 'hip-hop' game I've ever played, but this port didn't do an adequate job. Any resolution above 800*600 is simply strech, and it doesn't support xinput natively, which means you have to configure gamepad yourself.			"

												One of the games that defined my childhood. Awesome soundtrack. Awesome graffs that are diverse and customizable. Rather enjoyable combat system. The only issue that I personally have with the game is that the camera moves a little too fast, but you will get used to it easily.			"

												I dont know why i didnt made a review of this, well, this game is a legend in my life, i met this game in a magazine in 2006, i was just 11 years old and i had an old pc, i used to put the webpage of the game all the day just to see the info and that stuff, in that times i didnt had a ps2 or a xbox to play so i never played it so long time after that i played in a friend house but was the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ i wanted that game, finnaly like 3 years ago i downloaded a torrent and played it, omg, i love it, its an awesome game about graffiti, it ""teachs"" you stuff about it.Funny, creative, good controls, good thematic, if you like graffiti and you always looked for a game to tag in whatever place u want, this is your game, you will paint from trains and walls until spectaculars, zeppelins, police barracks and more.9/10			"

												Don't be fooled by my game time on Steam. I bought this game when it came out and have played this game well over 1000+ hours on Ps2 and Xbox OG.This game from start to finish, masterpiece. I really wish I could express my exact thoughts on this game, but I cannot put any of it into words. This game is literally a work of art. I hope one day to see a 2nd or at the very least an HD remake, I would sell my organs for it.			"

												I'm gonna start off by saying, I love this game. This game embodies everything I want from a dystopian counter culture videogame. The music is beautiful, all the music is perfectly chosen and the music written by RJD2 for the soundtrack is simply superb.The art direction phenomenal, if you can watch the opening cinematic and not feel the nostalgia Trane is trying to convey, I straight up feel bad for you. Even in game, the art is great, the graffiti you can throw down is all varied and customisable.The story is really good, following a guy who has nothing, fighting tooth and nail to get himself somewhere... anywhere... up. Then there's the rest of the story that I don't want to spoil.Then you get to the game itself and you have a really well put together action-platformer with good stealth elements and plenty of secrets of collectibles to find. A really lengthy game too with plenty of levels that keep changing enough and adding new elements to keep it from getting stale. Don't let my steam playtime fool you, I completed this game several times as a teen on the OG Xbox and I'm probably 3 areas deep in this playthrough, of about 12? (off the top of my head) so if you pick this up on sale, you've got yourself an absolute bargain. Heck, even at full price I still think this release is worth it.			"

												Ok, Let me first start off saying  that this game was once a great game in it's time. i recomend this game to the one's that can keep a open mind that this game was made back in 2000-2005 so please keep in mind it has some bugs and gliches that might cheepin the game play but overall it's a great game . The graphics arn't all that plus on top of that the fighting sytle sucks, but like i said before, ""you have to keep a open mind"" that this game is a graffiti-art game which makes up for the lack of the game's fighting sytle and as well as story line. This game is a classic.			"

												I've been hoping to play this game for quite a while, but I've never relly had the chance. Now I bought it on Steam since it became available and I gotta say: It's really awesome! Perfect just about for anyone, interested in graffiti or not. And don't let the Metacritics score or the outdated graphics fool you. There's just something about this game that makes you want to keep playing and playing. In my opinion, it pretty much deserves 8.5/10.I hope they'll release the sequel soon.			"

												A very unique game with a great artstyle and culture references.Pros:+ your taggs and pieces progress and become more detailed by the end of the game+ very cool leveldesign with gamechanging mechanics and various changing locations+ parkour is very good and the climbing puzzles are some of the best ive seen in any videogame+ very good balancing of the difficulty+ cool soundtrack including rock and hip hop+ you always have additional goals or can place taggs freely everywhere on your own+ controller support! By the time this game came out there was no 360, so naturally there is no support for it. But you can simply edit an ini file to change it so you can use a 360 one. (Steam Guides has you covered)+ the story is nothing groundbreaking but for a game that revolves around the sprayer cultre its pretty good actually+ all the graffiti present in the game are awesome+ well worth your money, this is a lenghty game with 13-16 hours story mode+ boss fights and a variety enemies+ prepare your blackbook and choose your pieces and taggs+ aerosol, wildstyle, pieces, murals, roll ups,  you name it+ combat varies from brawling to stealth elements+ many secrets and collectiblesCons:- stealth is not that great and fleshed out. Often you stumble into an enemy you wanted to kill silently- camera can sometimes be a problem in fights, but nothing too bad- some minor buggs here and there- the fights are clunky and are tempting you to wildly button mash- not many options for the Pc port. You can clearly see this was out on a console firstOverall its a fantastic game with various gameplay elements that fit together. You just have to know that its a 10 year old game now and has some minor flaws. But I definitley recommend playing this, even if you are not familiar with the sprayer culture.			"

YouTube™ Video: Attention! Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure 

			Views: 165		

			http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Marc_Eck%C5%8D's_Getting_Up:_Contents_Under_Pressure http://store.steampowered.com/app/260190/ Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Little_B_Gaming		

http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Marc_Eck%C5%8D's_Getting_Up:_Contents_Under_Pressure The written review is way too long and can't post the whole review here, so you have to watch my video for complete information about the game. Art is a crime and the biggest criminals are graffiti artists. This is according to New Radius mayor and our main character Trane is about to become the most wanted person.I want to start with the things I don't like before I continue with story, gameplay etc. Firstly is the lack of any video options, beside resoluition, that you choose in a launcher. Secondly, you can't rebind in-game the keys. You have to delve in a file if you want to change them, but it's not necessary. Thirdly, mouse sensetivity is high and again you have to delve in to files to lower it. This applies for FOV too. Just check PCGamingWiki. Also I have some problems with the AI, but later I will cover it. There few small bugs, that are worth mentioning. In some cases there is overlapping voices or they are too quiet. In other, the game starts loading, when the cutscene is not entirly over. But the biggest bug I encounter is a flickering, when painting a graffiti. If you select restart in doesn't restart from the last checkpoin, but in the beginning of the level. I found that the hard way. Also it's worth noticing almost 1 minute loading times, when you enter a new level. Non of this is gamebreaking, it's just annoying and most of the problems can be fixed.So after I left all behind all the negative stuff, it's time to concentrate on the positive and from here to the end of this review, it's all that.The graphics are all right. It's 9 year old game, so they didn't age very well, but the game is definitely not ugly. People are jaggy, but the city or to be precise parts of the city are well made, vibrant, colorful, despite the “gray” situation. In the end, if you are turn off by graphics, you will miss a lot.You take the role of Trane, young man, who wants to make a name by become graffiti artist. Despite the protest of his grandmother, he runaway from home with that idea in mind. In the beginning Trane is making his way in the slums, where he grow up and  he paint in the wrong places and encounters Vandals of New Radious and their leader Gabe. Our hero is beaten by gang, but he get up and continues the make graffiti. But in New Radius artist like Trane are not welcome. What in the beginning is getting revenge on VoNR, soon becomes more complicated. While painting graffiti Trane faces the bitter reallity. New Radious is shiny outside and rotten inside. Mayor Sung wants to make the city to look prosperous. For this purpose he is using C.C.K. (Civil Conduct Keeper), armored police force created from the government, to suppress the free speech and people from the slums by using violence, as long as no cameras are around. Pretty soon Trane finds, that the Sung hands are “dirty”. Half of the game is making a name for Trane and the other half everything turns 180 for him and the graffiti is one of his ways to protest againts the corrupt mayor. The other is his fighting skills. The story is worth following, but don't expect something groundbreaking.Ah, sweet, sweet gameplay. It's a mix between PoP-style acrobatics, street fighting, stealth and painting graffiti.Trane likes to make graffitis not only on the ground level, but on high and dangerous places. Big part of the game is platforming. Climbing on outfalls, bridges, walking or hanging on ledges, bouncing from walls on so many different places. Don't expect from Trane to do wild acrobatic stunts like in PoP or AC. He feels heavy, but agile enough and I like this. Trane is regular guy, not some super hero.Fighting system is good. If you are coming from a game like Batman Arkham series, maybe you will be disappointed, but I love it. As a hole battles are little bit slow, but more stratigic. This is not Devil May Cry. You have a punch, a kick, combination of both, grabbing enemy, block and dodge roll. But that's not all. You have to change combos frequently and dodge roll, because enemy adapts and block your punches and kicks. But there is a “cure” for that. Under your health is the Power bar. While you make three hit combo, hold the button on the third press and this will break the block with a powerful punch or kick and make more damage. But the Power bar drains and there is two ways to restore it. Stun an enemy and make humiliating move or just hit him. Of course, you will unlock new set of moves for kicking, punching and so on. Grabbing is especially useful for dealing with powerful enemies. Figthing feels great. Trane doesn't know martial arts, just what the streets taught him. If you run into a 4-5 enemies, you maybe able to beat them. It's hard, but not impossible. It's better to stalk and eliminate the one by one. And when you get in a fight, watch when enemy will make move, then dodge roll and beat him. You can lock on a single target, but I find out if they are more, it's better not to do it, because your combos can hit multiple targets.There are available weapons in the game. You can find pipes, pice of wood, buckets, radio and others. They can change course of a battle. After few hits with, they break. I really like how Trane is picking items – by dodge rolling. This is the coolest way!!! No need to stop and picking it up and wasting time. Great idea!!!Here stealth is encourage. A lot of battle can be avoided, you don't get XP points from them. So, it's better to crouch, walk behind enemy and knock him down. There isn't some stealth mechanic, like sticking to a wall. Just crouch, hide or get somewhere high and wait for you moment to strike. You have to hold 2 buttons to knock enemy down, but either you have to do it extremely precise or i'm doing it wrong, because in a lot of situations I just start a fight. Probably it's my fault.Except fighting and platforming, big part of the game is painting graffitis. They are awesome!!! Their design is incredible! Through them you will gain reputation and unlock concept art, combos, graffiti and so on. While painting, you have limited time for doing it. In addition to that, you must not make drips. If you succeed with both, this will get you more reputation and unlock faster everything I mention above. When you start to paint, pressure in the can lowers and you have to stop to recharge When you enter a level, you have few main graffiti to paint and some optional. More you make, more reputation you'll gain. Other side objectives vary between writing, sticking posters (I hate them) and others to a wall, cars, doors.. Before each mission, you can choose your arsenal of graffiti, stickers and other. If don't want the game will change them for you, if you unlock them.For easier way to find all spots to hit, you have Intuition. Sometimes they are not easy to see. With a press of a button all the places you can paint are marked with “X”. The level design is awesome. The game is linear, it's not open world. Slums, factory for meat, bridge, warehouse and so on. All are greatly design, so you can climb where you need to go, to fight and to paint graffiti. Platforming is not a challenge. You just need to look around for a few seconds. Sometimes they are more wide open, other more linear. When you start a level your objectives will be shown. How you approach them, it's up to you to decide. But start with stealth. A lot of times levels a heavily guarded. There some that keep you on your toes, because of a time limit, other because of the design.			"

The story is that good! It's also a very unique game with the whole graffiti element. This game also has the best soundtrack ever! It fit's so well to the theme and really get's you pumped during fights! You will be fustrated a couple of times while playing, but I will still recomend it. Another thing is the cutscenes. THEY ARE GODS WORK! They are SO beautifully executed, ESPECIALLY the movie ones. All in all a fantastic game, go buy it while it's on sale!

												One of those classic games that came out in the early 2000's for the PS2. This game takes place in a fascist New York where the government is ruthless and brutal and the only way to get your point across and rebel is thought street art. You play as a Graffiti artist named Trane who is out to rebel and get his name up in the Street art hall of fame. You start off as some wanna be thug who tags for the sake of it but things start to get more serious as the story progresses and you find yourself playing more of a freedom fighter rather than a ruffian. A decent game if you're looking for something nostalgic and classic to play.			"

Most things take mose and keybored and that ruins it for me but other wise this game is still fun no matter what. Yes i do recommend the game if you were around those days of the hard core hiphop of the day and dont mind no (real) controller support. Wish they would try in the future to put fully controller support in this game			"

												This game has way too many issues to stay enjoyable 'till the end.- Random Crashes- Sound Issues & Graphical Glitches (final two cutscenes didn't even have sound for me)- Awful combat (it works against weak enemies but when the CCK starts ganging up on you you won't have an enjoyable time.- Annoying Camera which stutters in some situations were you are fighting or chooses some weird angle- Bad Controls (the times i wanted to stealthly finish something and it did a kick or punch while doing it ... aaaargh!)The game felt too long for me to stay interesting as well, you learn new types of graffiti/street art during the game but it's not very interesting or worth it. If i have to say positive things they are...+ Some of the graffiti is really funny or humoristic+ The music fits the game really wellWhat i recommend is to save your money and just watch this on YouTube, you'll get the fun things of the game that way without having to deal with the awful controls and combat.

												Amazing classic game played this when it was first realsed in 2005 and wanted to play it again for years waiting for it to come on to steam and now i can its so much better second time around. You take the role as Trane a young teen who wants to follow in his father's footsteps as a graffiti artist. The game takes you on action/adventure with hours of gameplay and for an old game the A.I and graphics work very well for old mechanics. Its a absoutle must buy for 6 pound well worth it.			"

												Amazing game with one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Great story with fun characters and missions. The fighting is fun has a lot to do in terms of taking down foes. The part where the game shines the most though is through the graffiti and painting aspect with beautiful options. There is tons of options to choose from what to graffiti and fun side challenges called free form challenges. The only complaint I have over the game is that the climbing can be awkward and you can fall to your death from the same spot which can become very frustrating. The game itself is pretty challenging and anyone looking for one should try this game. Overall rating: 9/10			"

												One of the best games ever released on PS2; the last generation from that console era gave us some real diamonds (GTA:SA, God of War 2, Final Fantasy XII, Splinter Cell:Chaos Theory & Double Agent, etc). Has more depth, inventive gameplay, and a better soundtrack than most games of the modern era.Port is awkward; mouse sensitivity is an issue if you don't own a variable speed mouse. A similar problem to the port of GTA: Vice City. But does support a 1080x1920 res. so it does well enough.Maybe has nostalgia value only. It might be difficult for a newbie to overcome the awkward controls. But I plan on 100%ing this badboy again.Let the Mobb Deep play.""New radius used to be alive...""			"

												What's up, your favorite girl to hate on here, let me give you some dislike fodder. I have not really encountered a reason not to buy this if you are interested, nice graffiti focused title, released on steam to pay homage to the yesteryears of gaming. It is crucial to remember that if you are a graphics snob, this may not please you, though the graphics appear tobe light years above the PS2 release, which come on, PS2 cannot be compared to PC, that's just stupid. Anyway. If you were, or are into graffiti subculture. you cannot go wrong here, okay controls, if a controller does not work, or work foryou, the mouse and keyboard are not awful, nor the best. I guess you could simplify this statement, and say that thisgame has controls you must acclimatize too. I would recommend it, just give it some slack, PERSONALLY have notencountered issues, except minor things a simple reset for me fixed. The soundtrack is older mainstream rap, I justplay metal over it, or something else. It is fun to assault police, and vandalize things as they grow in ferocity.I am unsure how to precisely describe the controls, I have not played in  awhile, but I do not remember them being terrible, nor the best. The story is about a graffiti artist named, ""Trane"", and how he rose through ranks of other graffiti artists, and he becomes the typical, ""Anarchists, and bane of authoratative jerks"". It was doing parkour when it was in a time period where it was new to the gaming scene, besides a FEW other titles that had it, it was not a thing yet.I would recommend giving this game a try, keep moderate expectations, either enjoy the game's story, which truly is NOT awful, but not a literary master piece either. Kind of like my reviews to some people. Ho ho ho.. F you....But all merriment aside, also a few cliche moments aside. Pick this one up if parkour/platforming, with a side of action, and... Vandalism???? Is your thing.			"

												So first off Marc,the whole anti-establishment graffiti culture thing is tainted a bit when you put cynical product placement for things like Nokia N-gages and Apple Ipods in your game. Secondly, if you're going to have stealth in your game and have a stealth takedown then it'd be nice if you had it mapped to a single button so you aren't constantly trying to take down a guard but then either kicking the guy in the back or worse still doing an extremely loud kick behind the guard that doesn't connect and leaves you looking like an eejit. Thirdly, if you're going to have so much combat it'd be nice if your enemies didn't have seemingly unavoidable attacks. Fourth that lunge attack the guards make is awful not only is it immensely frustrating to be running away only to get lunged at knocking you to the floor it makes no sense. Are the guards part dog? Fifth, Russian sounding assassin lady who walks around wearing some sort of lingerie, fishnet stockings, knee high leather boots and a mini skirt AND talks in a faux russian accent. Could you be more cliched? Well, yes, you could have your elite super guards in leather trench coats. Sixth ""Art is illegal"" say the guards. In what world is tagging, AKA writing your name on things art?Seven, it is vaguely hillarious kicking a guy off of a buiding then watching as he stands bolt upright  on nothing and just drops. He doesn't fall mind, he drops. On a perfectly vertical axis. Eight, so you go through a level doing the repetitive as all hell minigame for graffiti (which you do aproximately several million times through the game) and then you get killed by an unblockable OP guard you get send back to a checkpoint and have to repeat All... of the damned graffiti minigame arts all over again, those collectables, do it again, those challenges. Again. Or you just give up and cry. It might be fine if their were more checkpoints, if you could trigger them twice, if the game was more fun, there weren't so many collectables and arts to do in the first place.For the love of god, don't play this, if you're already nostalgic for it then fine but it is an attrocious mess. It doesn't even support an xbox controller out of the box you have to change the config files for that.This may be the worst game I've ever completed. If you are considering buying it then personally I would hold out for Banksy's game.			"

												This game is a story-driven beat-em-up with stealth elements, although most of your time will be spent ""going over"" the graffiti of others. At its core, it has a fun concept. There is even a pretty wide variety of graffiti (your designs get more elaborate and varied with each chapter) to keep you going through the graffiti process. But there are three fatal flaws which bring this game down. First, the ""freeform challenges"" require you to write marker tags on things. They're boring as hell, and there is literally no reason to vary your tags. But you get reputation from it which is required to unlock things, so you feel obligated to do them. Second, there is a mixture between action, stealth, and platforming (reminiscent of prince of persia) which really isn't bad overall; however, there is a disproportionate amount of required stealth at certain points in the game with controls and interface that aren't designed for stealth. It's frustrating when you have no indication that someone will or will not see you and a good portion of the game is based on this. The final issue is the camera. It glitches around frequently. By frequently I mean pretty much all the time. As soon as you approach a surface the image will stop popping in and out, the camera will start shaking, or suddenly you will be looking in the complete opposite direction. There is camera control, but it doesn't work for some reason when you're near things.The final straw for me was doing a series of jumps with a group of guards below me when my character suddenly began walking off to the side and getting off the platform. I corrected this, at which point he immediately jumped into a wall and stayed there where the guards (who now saw him) could not kill him with their taser arrow things. Yeah I don't know what those are.TL;DR It's glitchy as hell.			"

												This game had a lot of potential, but is ruined by a terrible control scheme.  The buttons for a lot of things are sort of weirdly placed and the gamepad controls are impossible to use.  The graphics are so-so, and the movement for combat is smooth, but the freerunning they expect you to do is stunted and filled with awkward motions and delays that just make the 'experience' rather unimpressive in the end.  The music isn't bad and I'd consider getting a copy of the soundtrack to add to my collection of music.			"

												Overall this game is absolutely terrible. I would recommend it to noone.Bad points-Gameplay (?) is buried under a ton of issues, but what little I saw was boring. ""Evade the guard"" - the guard is clearly watching you tag his truck repeatedly from 10 metres away (with the same tag at the same angle and same size over and over and over again) and doesn't appear to mind. -Camera is on drugs, jiggling around all over, stuttering, being unpredictable-Controls are horrible. They just respond wrong everywhere-The game ""looks like it might be Mirrors-Edgey"" but it is anything but - the whole thing is clunky.-Animations are... 'wtf'. I don't even know what they're trying to show. -Graffiti system is horrible (hold middle mouse then hold left click!?) and it's not even animated in a fun way. It just draws it from left to right...-Combat system is horrid and horrifically complex (there are about 60 combinations of attack, block, defend all mapped to variations like ""hold left and right mouse button, wiggle the mouse and press e whilst moving around the character"".) And isn't this a graffiti game?-The artwork is not ""bad like old"" it's bad like _bad_. Nothing seems scaled right, the art doens't fit together, there's no atmosphere.-The graphics are bad -the ui is all scaled wrong, covered in weird artefacts and some things just look plain buggy-Menu's are long, slow, irritating and impossible to work out what they meanGood points...-The intro video is pretty-Your name is Trane and you ride a train. That mildly amused me.-Trane's grandma is less than half the height of a door despite being proportioned otherwise normally. "

												There are a lot of things to like and dislike about this game. There were some issues with the problems, that most people seem to have. The problem is that textures on walls and the groun would sometimes glitch. It did not make the game unplayable, but it was annoying to have this problem. Something else I did not like about it is balance issues in the progress of the game. The game would be REALLY EASY in some in some levels and be followed by a REALLY HARD level then go right back to easy.  Other than those two issues I really like the game. It had a good soundtrack. The graphics, when they working at 100%, were pretty good, especially considering when the game was made. I also like the level layouts. They truly thought about the design of each level and where to have you place your tags. I like how they had a stealth aspect to this game and a good fighting system. I would definetly recommend this game to my friends.			"

												This game has Jane's Addiction in it's soundtrack.10/10In all seriousness, this is a great game, I barely got the chance to play it on PS2 back in 2005, as the second my mother heard ""GET THE ♥♥♥♥ OUTTA HERE."" the game was immediately taken back to EB Games.As others have said before, this game isn't for everyone, it has a decent parkour system, a bit clunky, not as smooth a say Tomb Raider Legend which came out around the same time but it's not glitchy. This game is all about ""♥♥♥♥ the police."" but in a good way (Corrupt military police state city.), much in the same sense as Mirror's Edge except you beat people silly AND put your tags on everything, combat is also really good in this game. I really like this game, it's style and the message it portrays and the music is pretty good, most of it being licensed, from Jane's Addiction to Del The Funky Homosapien and Roots Manuva. I haven't played the whole game yet but as far as I've gotten I'd say it's a big recommendation from me.Some pros and cons:Game is obviously dated being that it's damn near ten years old but the dynamic shadows and textures are honestly holding up pretty well. -Game is almost impossible to enjoy with a keyboard and mouse, gamepad DEFINITELY recommended. +Gamepad support.-Gamepad execution could have been a lot better, there are no button prompts and it only uses DInput which gives the Xbox 360 controller trigger issues although the buttons assigned to each trigger do not need to be used at the same time ever, without button prompts the game is difficult to understand control wise. I hope the developers add Xbox 360 button prompts and XInput support just to make it feel more polished.+Game supports 1080p widescreen. -But the HUD and all 2D elements such as the pause screen and main menu are stretched.-I've also suffered audio issues, ambience and all sound effects not playing in cutscenes.In closing, Devolver, we NEED an HD remake of this gem with smoother gameplay, more music and perfect controller support. Please make it happen.			"

I now own it on every platform with 500+ hours on the xbox version and roughly 50 on the ps2. Cant wait to rack up time on my computers with an Xbox One controller. This game has changed my life, I gotta lotta empties in my basement because of this unique masterpiece. The graphics are starting to get a bit dated but the gameplay is still awesome. If you think it looks good and youre not sure so youre out here reading reviews, just wait till you see it on sale. if you know what ultra flat black smells like then buy this, full price is totally worth it and your gonna enjoy it.9/10 --Im taking away a point for that wack camera. seriously.

												I felt that it was easier to put my thoughts on Hip Hop: The Videogame into a Pro/Con list, so here goes: Pros: Levels have a lot of varietyEnemies have a fair amount of varietyGreat SoundtrackCombat is fluid, if but a bit repetitiveSeveral of the CG cutscenes have great directing and cinematographyStealth is often encouraged, and when the stealth sections work, they’re greatThe bosses are fun, but I just finished it and can only remember two of them, so take from that what you willGood story Cons: The story takes quite a while to get goingSome stealth sections are poor and sometimes it’s just easier to kill the roomThis is very clearly a PS2 port, and textures freak out occasionallyThe game’s cameraman sometimes forgets his seizure medicationControls can be janky Verdict It has its problems, but it is definitely worth a playthrough. Get it whilst it’s on sale. "
