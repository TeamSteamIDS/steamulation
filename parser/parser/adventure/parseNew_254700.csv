												Resident Evil 4 is nine years old, and still the best action game I've ever played. It's still thrilling when I nail four Ganados with a single shotgun blast, still tense when I face down a relentless Iron Maiden before it impales me with deadly spikes. I'm on edge even when I know I'm safe, still creeped out by the foreboding pressure Resident Evil 4 constantly exerts through its thumping industrial soundtrack and grim environments.Most of the time, this updated HD version of Resident Evil 4 is the best version of the game I've played, and I beat it on both the GameCube and the Playstation 2. I wish it were perfect, but it's not quite there, occasional moments of slowdown and a few interface issues are minor flaws in an otherwise fantastic port.The most significant additions Capcom made to this version of Resident Evil 4—higher definition textures and a locked 60 fps framerate—are both adjustable in the graphics options settings. The game defaults to the new HD textures and 60 frames per second, but also includes the original textures and a 30 fps option.There's a problem with that locked 60 fps, though—if anything causes the game to dip below 60, which happened to me multiple times in my playthrough, it starts moving in slow motion.Even with intermittent slowdown issues on older hardware, I'd call this the definitive version of Resident Evil 4. 60 fps feels as smooth as it should. And Resident Evil 4 itself feels as impeccably designed as ever, a high point against which other third-person shooters should be judged. Resume: Resident Evil 4 is still a masterful shooter nine years later. Occasional slowdown caused by the locked 60 fps framerate hampers an otherwise great port.Rating: 90-100 Buy it!			"

												(TLDR? This review is also available in video format if you scroll down.)Nine years have passed since Resident Evil 4’s initial release on the GameCube and it still holds up quite well. It’s a massively influential game that helped pioneer the third person shooter genre as well as completely changed the face of survival horror.You’ll once again fill the shoes of Leon Kennedy as he searches for the President's missing daughter, Ashley, in a remote area of Spain. She’s being held by a mysterious cult, known as the Los Illuminados who are utilizing a mind-controlling parasite called Las Plagas in order to gain power. The village that Leon first comes across is filled with infected townsfolk aptly named Ganado or “herd” in English, who are hell-bent on stopping Leon. Resident Evil 4 continues the tradition of offering an eccentric and ridiculous narrative that successfully links some of the franchise's biggest characters to its events but also stands well enough on its own that newcomers are not left scratching their heads.The controls are solid and responsive but may feel somewhat strange to those that are accustomed to modern third person shooters. Leon is unable to move and shoot at the same time and must remain stationary when aiming. The camera also obscures a lot of your surroundings, adding to the overall tension and horror.When it comes to the gameplay and combat, the Plagas-infected enemies present a satisfying challenge. They will relentlessly pursue Leon, often trying to flank him. Removing an enemies’ head will often just allow the Plagas themselves to emerge and engage Leon directly or swing around from the host’s neck. The enemies react appropriately to each wound, dropping their weapons or stumbling rewarding your aim with purpose and control. Shield bearing cult members and blind mutants with massive claws that must be dispatched by killing the parasites on their backs also refresh the enemy roster. Several satisfying boss fights provide the cherry on top of the Resident Evil 4 gameplay experience. It also features a great inventory management and upgrade system, allowing you to customize various weapons to suit your play style.The greater focus on action does mean that scares are less frequent than they were in previous entries. Wandering around a hedge maze with Plagas infested wolves waiting to jump out of bushes and seeking keys whilst being pursued by wheezing, seemingly unstoppable regenerators are some of Resident Evil 4's few terrifying highlights during its three acts. While the first two acts are brilliantly executed, the third act loses a bit of momentum at parts, focusing more on action opposed to horror. This handful of minor grimace worthy moments is largely lost amidst the rest of the experience which will take most players fifteen or more hours on their first playthrough.As if the main campaign wasn't long enough, Assignment Ada offers additional content as a mini game through the third act where you collect five samples of the Las Plagas parasite. Mercenaries mode challenges players to survive and kill as many enemies as possible. It's an addictive mode that would go on to become a staple of the franchise by enticing players with a risk/reward system, stringing together kills gives players a multiplier and breaking hourglasses extends the time of the session, providing a greater opportunity to post a high score.  It’s a challenging variant on the gameplay that requires mastery of each stage to unlock further content and rewards. With these additional modes, it's really easy to get thirty hours of entertainment from Resident Evil 4. If that’s not enough, there’s also a Separate Ways campaign which acts as a mini scenario B filling in Ada’s perspective of the story with new bosses, viewpoints and a new area to complete substantially fleshing out the story.The muted, earth tone rich Spanish village that serves as Resident Evil 4's setting is a massive departure from the dark, claustrophobic and sinister mansion from the first game and the post-apocalyptic city scape of the second and third games. When it was first released, Resident Evil 4 was one of the most impressive graphical showcases of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube. With a 1080p resolution, a frame rate of 60 FPS and some rescaled textures, Resident Evil 4 looks better than ever. It still looks its age but is still capable of impressing. The atmosphere is as rich in 2014 as it was in 2005 but it's still the same game and some low-res textures can be found.Resident Evil 4 is a bittersweet experience, along with Half-Life 2, it helped foreshadow what was to come with new hardware as well as perfectly reinvigorating and updating a franchise that was in danger of losing its appeal as new hardware changed gamers expectations. In doing so however, Resident Evil 4 shifted the franchise's inertia toward action and with the next couple installments; Resident Evil would almost entirely forsake its horror roots. With the death of Resident Evil as a horror game, much of the survival horror genre fell into mediocrity with Dead Space being one of the few titles to successfully straddle the line between action and horror before becoming a victim of the same fate. Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games of the new millennium. It maintained enough of the elements of its predecessors to be identifiable as a Resident Evil game while otherwise reinventing the franchise. Its timeless gameplay, great art direction and mostly excellent bosses make it very playable almost a decade after its original release. If you haven't played Resident Evil 4, now is as good a time as any.TLDR? This review is also available in video format (I did the editing while my friend Josh handled the voice over):

			Contains: Spoilers We sit down and discuss the Resident Evil series, the survival horror genre, and what's happening in the game industry today.		

Pros:+ A solid port, Resident Evil 4 looks better than ever at 1080p and 60FPS. + Amazing gameplay & enemy reactions+ Excellent Atmosphere & Environments+ Fantastic inventory and upgrade system+ Good balance of horror and action+ Great additional contentCons:- Somewhat weaker third act- Irritating Ashley AI- The beginning of the end (The success of Resident Evil 4 lead to the franchise shifting more towards the action side of things.)Note: A controller is strongly recommended. It also seems that quite a few people with AMD/ATI Processors and video cards have been experiencing some slow-down. I haven't had any technical difficulties running the game but I'm running an Intel I5 3570k and a GTX560TI. I imagine this issue will be patched shortly though for those experiencing it.Overall, Resident Evil 4 is a solid port and a must play. The 60 FPS is actually extremely noticeable when compared to the Xbox 360 and PS3 HD releases of the game, making it feel smoother than ever.If you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/ "

												One thing to get out of the way, if you do decide to buy this game, I highly recommend using an XBOX controller. It will make your life so much easier.Pro - The character models for the most part look very nice. Capcom has updated the models to make them sharper, crispier, and added new textures.- The framerate is now in 60FPS-Has all the extra from the re-releases of the game-Great texture mods are available (or will be)-Same great gameplay from 2005-1080pCon - Motion blur is beyond terrible,I highly recommend that you turn it off ASAP.-Only about 10% of the game has HD textures, the other 90% are old textures with a filter over it (2xSAL)-No new extras-You can't aim and walk (not an issue for me but might annoy you)-Tank controls (not an issue for me)-Might not run great on certain computers (runs fine on mine, GTX 880M, i7-4810MQ 2.8Ghz)Verdict-Overall, this is a great version of Resident Evil 4. I don't think Capcom has a reason to release this game again unless they are doing a full ""HD"" version (100% updated graphics, lighting, updated controls, ect..), but I am sure this will be the ""final"" version.-If you love RE4 or have never played it, then I highly suggest buying this game. This is one of the greatest video games of all time. It revolutionized the 3rd person shooter. - I am pretty disappointed at the ""HD"" in the title (it is a little misleading), but this is the ""definite"" version of RE4.			"

												So the game starts off with the blonde dude from el dorado getting lost in spain during the 1500's (I think?) while he is looking for some chick with tig ol' bitties. After  kindly  asking the locals where he may find said boobies, he is locked up with the actor from mission impossible. Then he decides to go fishing, pet a couple of dogies, and remove a tumor from the big friendly giant. At this point, justin bieber is haveing an internal crises and decides to go to church and, what do ya know, big booty Bertha was here the whole time!1! Then they meet the pope, but in this universe the pope is actually the main vilian from assassins creed so he's a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then they run allllllllll around the place and kill a bunch of dudes cause this game is rated M for Masacure and they find Tom Cruise again and then Tom emidiently leaves again, and then they remove another tumor from another giant (this game is actually the spiritual secsessor to surgion simulator) and then they fight the villiage cheese because he was actully ugly or something aND THE VILLIAGE CHSSES IS LIKE ""THIS ISNT EVEN MY FINALE FORM"" AND HE BREAKS OUT INTO HIVES AND HIS STOMACH GOES *CROOSHCI* AND HES LIKE TRYING TO KILL BRAD PITT AND THE WHOLE PLACE IS ON FIRE CASUE SOMEONE DROPPED MY MIXTAPE AND BRADD IS LIKE ""YIPPEEKYAY MOTHERF-"" AND THE WHOLE PLACE BLOWS UP AND THEn he gets the dragon ball. At this point, the locals dont want justin beebs in the villiage anymore so they chase him and his biotch to the nearby castle and the burger king comes out and hes like ""who were you excpeting, sportaflop?"" So now mario is running all around peaches castle trying to get the 210 stars or something and then he gets separated from peach but then he finds her again, also the pope kills Tom Cruise (looks like this mission...was impossible *laugh bit*). Lets see, what else happens, uhhhhh the dudes ex girlfriend shows up and leaves and shows up again and leaves and ummmm the princess is captured again and then you gotta fight an assassin bug thingy or something  can you say ""LSD"" ???  and then after getting the head of a goat, a lion, and a snake (that♥♥♥♥♥♥ACTUALLY happens) you fight Napolean for the finale showdown and UH-OHHHHHHH!!!!!1!! TURNS OUT NAPOLEAN HAD ALL THE CHAOS EMERALDS AND BY SACRAFICING HIMSELF AND ON OTHER MOSTER, HE CAN SPECIAL SUMMON ANNACONDA IN ATTACK MODE! BUT He is easily killed by bullets. An eye for an eye amiright? *laugh bit* and then you get down to the docks and the crazy ex girlfriend is like ""sorry, but your princess is in another castle."" So she takes you to el Dorado which is actually doctor willey's lab. then she leaves again because. just because. So then the blonde guy is like ""I am a god and you must worship me"" but the locals say ""♥♥♥♥ you"" and then they start fighting but you win cause you came from spain and therefore you have guns and they dont. Then you find the princess and then you go dumptser diving and you fight like the most disgusting things ever and then you commence grand theft auto and steal truck and drive it into a building because you let the girl drive (dumbass) and then the princess is taken away like serioulsy put a leash on this chick! Then you fight a slug and JESUSS ♥♥♥♥ING CHRIST WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS- OH MY GOD GET THAT THING THE ♥♥♥♥ AWAY FROM ME I- i- oh man I almost vomited. I'm skipping the slug fight. Then you fight Rambo but in this universe Rambo is actually a♥♥♥♥♥♥(hey, i think ive uncovered a central theme in this game). so then a helicopter shows up and its like that scene from call of duty when the helicoper shows up and its like *BANG BANG BANG BANG* AND *SHHHHHHOOWW BOOOOOOM BOOM BBBBBOOMOOJOAJOMOJM* and it gets shot down because all good things must come to and end (or♥♥♥♥♥to an end if you know what im saying *cricket chirping*). and now its time for the finale showdown with the pope and hE TURNS INTO A-a-ummmmm, what the fu- what is he supposed to be? well, whatever, he has a big eyeball and therefore by zelda rules you must shoot its eye. And your girlfriend is all like ""its dangorous to go alone, take this"" and gives you an RPG and you pick it up and aim it at the bad guy and say ""knock knock, whose there? you're ugly"" and you fire the misille and the bad guys dying the music gets all sad and the women starts singing ""in the arrrrrrmmmms of an angle, fly awwwwaaaaaayyyy!"" and then the crazy ex girlfriend pushes the self destruct button because thats how the road to El Derado ends right? and so the dude and saggy♥♥♥♥♥♥get on the boat and leave the island and use a jet ski to get back to America, or most likely to be eaten by sharksoverall, I give this book a 9/10Its deffinantly in my top ten and maybe even top five games of all time.

												Resident Evil 4 was released in 2005 for GameCube and was later released on other platforms. It looks like Capcom wanted to significantly improve its visuals for the second PC port as the first PC port was released in 2007. The graphics are sharper than ever and the gameplay is very good, although a few small problems exist.This game has been enhanced for 1080p resolution at 60FPS. There is keyboard and mouse support with the ability to customize the keys. Resident Evil 4 HD comes with the Separate Ways campaign to increase replay value. The keyboard and mouse work very well together, but sometimes the laser targeting is not perfect and that can lead to problems when there are multiple enemies near you or when a large boss monster is approaching.The plot of the game begins with the kidnapping of Ashley Graham, the daughter of the president of the United States. Leon Kennedy, the well-known protagonist of the series, has been sent to a village in Spain to rescue Ashley. What happens in the Spanish village is that there is a religious cult that has released an ancient parasite called Las Plagas on to the countryside. The religious cult does not consist of zombies like other Resident Evil games. You begin fighting ganados, a group of foes who carry pitchforks and are both males and females. Later, you will meet darker and tougher foes known as cultists, religious zealots who wear red or black robes.As Leon progresses through the story, there will be memos explaining the plan of the cult known as the Illuminados. These memos keep you well informed of the plot and it seems to get darker and darker. The environments are appropriately creepy as Leon looks for Ashely. Resident Evil 4 retains the series’ history of creepy and dark locales. There are misty forests, decrepit houses, moldy caverns, a large castle, and military facilities. The locales display diversity so that there is no monotony. Leon is joined by other characters like Luis Sera and the Ada Wong. Luis Sera is a local citizen who is willing to help Leon. Leon engages in a long shooting with the ganados while Mr. Sera helps out in this long battle. Ada Wong is a familiar figure to Resident Evil fans and has had a long relationship with Leon. There are bits and pieces of the script that indicate past romances and rivalries. However, the plot keeps you at the edge of your seat at all times, which is the way it should be for a Resident Evil game.The graphical enhancements of the diverse locales are what make this game feel like it is not so old. The details of Leon, his allies, and enemies are impressively sharp and well defined. The walls of the castle look extremely realistic. You can see the dust falling from the ceiling of caverns that make the caverns both realistic and creepy. The textures look amazing in high resolution, but in some cases they look a little bit archaic and out of place. However, the details of the textures are sharp enough to outweigh any archaic look you may find. Military facilities make you feel like that there is a nasty experiment going on while it also feels abandoned.The bosses are diverse and require you to figure out their main weaknesses in order to defeat them. One issue that pops up in boss battles and in other parts of the game is the quick time events. Sometimes you have to press two buttons at once very quickly to avoid key attacks or avoid deadly traps. It can feel awkward trying to press the X + C keys or the two mouse buttons while using the WASD keys in tense circumstances. While it is appropriate to have tense circumstances in a Resident Evil game, it can get frustrating trying to press two keys at once but dying in the process because of you are not able to press the buttons in time. Another issue that comes up is the laser targeting of the firearms. There are times when the laser targeting takes time to be accurate while one or more enemies are quickly approaching you. Also, the laser can twitch in the spur of the moment, leading to more difficult encounters with the various types of enemies and possible waste of ammo. Ammo is always at a premium in the game, so twitching is a bad thing in a game like this.All firearms can be upgraded by visiting the various merchants that stand around waiting for you. Upgrading your weapons will make your shots noticeably more powerful. You can upgrade your weapons to the max so that you can be an “exclusive” weapon that will be far more powerful than the weapon you fully upgraded. The challenge is to find the pesetas scattered throughout the locales and dropped by the enemies. You will have to quite a bit of searching for pesetas and treasures with lots of value if you want to upgrade any of your firearms to the max.There is some randomness when it comes to shooting enemies, especially in the head. Some ganados and cultists will simply fall to their deaths with a headshot. Other enemies will show their Plagas, spider-like figures that emerge from their necks, and continue to try to attack you. You can either fire a shotgun at their Plagas or use a flash grenade to finally finish them off. There are encounters that require crowd control, so you can use different types of grenades to bring some relief to these tense encounters.Other enemies that are interesting and horrific include garradores, colmillos, and regenerators. The garradores do not attack unless they hear your sound and are blind. Their only weakness is the Plagas shown on their backs. Colmillos are terrifying dogs that can jump on top of you by surprise. Regenerators are special monstrosities in that you can only use a sniper rifle with an infrared scope to locate and shoot their Plagas on their torso.Resident Evil 4 is worth playing for its diverse locations, creepy atmosphere, and tense encounters. The nail biting gameplay lives up to what Resident Evil fans expect from a Resident Evil game. The high resolution graphics make the PC version the definitive version to play.My Score: 8.5/10			"

												Looking back at Resident Evil 4 it's almost startling how good this game ended up. It was in development for a really long time, shifted between completely different concepts and almost ended up scrapped a few times.Yet it pulled through, and became one of the most notable action games of the 6th generation. I say action game because that was what made Resi 4 so good. Resi 4 does not take place in the 'states like it's predecessors. Nor do you ever fight zombies. Instead you fight infected villagers. The dev team actually did this in a very unique way. Because of how the game employs a manual aiming system, firing at different body parts produces different reactions from enemies. Like you can stumble an enemy running at you by shooting him in the legs. This provides immense amounts of strategy to fighting enemies. Adding to that enemies will work together and use the environment against you.The atmosphere was extraordinary, the enemies were engaging and the combat was slick and new. Resi 4 might have not aged very well in the last 10 years, but it still leaves an impact that lasts a long time.			"

												We have the supervillain team of Dracula, Napoleon, Rambo, Bin Laden, and the Alien-Predator hybrid involved in a scheme to kidnap the President's daughter and infest her with telepathic parasites that make your head explode when you are shot in the big toe. They are opposed by Leon ""Solid Snake"" Kennedy, who has codec support from Ingrid ""I'm not Meryl!"" Hunnigan and a Spanish guy who gets impaled by Dracula's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥approximately midway through the game. Dracula's plan is to infect the chimpanzee-human hybrid that is the President's daughter with the parasites so that they can send her home to infest the President himself. They successfully infest her. One would think they would then simply let Leon save her, simplifying the process and making her reappearance less suspicious. But no. Dracula's minions apparently think the best way to deal with Ashley and Leon is to kill them. Despite the fact that this completely invalidates Dracula's plan. Some of Dracula's minions are cave trolls that he has imported from Middle-Earth...they must be the ones doing the planning that doesn't come directly from Dracula. So anyhow, Leon goes to a village, which is pretty fun. Then he goes to a castle, which gets kinda boring. Finally he goes to an island, which sucks. Also, Dracula turns into a giant spider and then dies.			"

												Do I really even need to write something here? Alright, if you insist.I reckon most of you are already familiar with this title from one of the previous releases. For those who aren't, well let's just say the trailer didn't lie about it being one of the highest rated games in history. Even if it has been nine years now, it still manages to retain the entertainment aspect. Speaking of this port in particular however, it is a much needed improvement over the previous release. The only thing I was disappointed with was that mouse aim isn't exactly responsive or so you will think when you first attempt to play the game while making use of a mouse. But truth is it just takes some time to get used to. If it was done any other way the game would be far too easy considering the nine year old AI's capabilities or more precisely lack of such.But here's what you really are reading this for...As far as ports go everything is top notch in terms of technical execution!Just as with all the previous Resident Evil ports that have been done by Capcom themselves.EDIT: Turns out the issue with the 60 FPS arose from the fact that it had used my integrated card which I didn't even consider because the game was running perfectly fine unless switched to 60 FPS. So basically if you experience issues with the 60 FPS setting, then just make sure it is actually using your high performance video card.			"

												Not just the best Resident Evil, but one of the best games of all time. Basically unrivaled even today for its pacing, variety, style, and replayability. A masterclass in game design.			"

 TL;DR Resident Evil 4 and its HD port onto Steam is great. For those that played the game back on the GameCube or PS2, everything is still here and better than ever. Those that are new, enjoy a game that is both action oriented, and horror inducing in all the best ways. [ + ] Gameplay is great. While common nowadays, back in 2005 the third person view with close in laser aim was revolutionary, and games like Dead Space and Evil Within owe thanks to this game. Something else I believed RE4 popularized was QTE's, which are used quite frequently throughout the game. I was never a fan of QTE's, and while this game had it's good ones, there were plenty of bad ones as well.[ + ] Graphics, like the gameplay, were amazing back in '05. That being said this game still looks great thanks to the HD port. 1080p with 60 FPS on top of HD textures really help the game look in its prime condition. Animations are also something I look for while playing games, and Capcom did a great job in making everything move and look like it should.[ + ] Plot surprisingly good. Older RE games focused on two things, survive and escape. While RE4 doesn't mess with that formula, it does change it up some. Leon being tasked with rescuing the President's daughter, is on a hunt to find her in rural Europe, then find a way out once that task is completed. The main / side characters I found to be interesting, while a couple others do get annoying as the game goes on.[ + ] Atmosphere holds true to the RE games, and really brings in something new of its own from the very beginning. From woods, to villages, to castles, to an island, they all give off the same creepy vibe of something not being right. You'll encounter scary enemies, fight tough bosses, solve puzzles, and fight to stay alive. Keeping true to the series.[ + ] Sound is standard in this game. The guns sound good, enemies sound scary, and music is average. But the save room music in this game, like all RE games is so...mystic and mesmerizing. It’s hard to describe and really stands out that much to me, giving me an eerily safe feeling before heading back out into that dangerous unknown.[ + ] AI is good. While Ashley's character is generally seen as an annoyance, she does well to stick close by you and never stray far when danger is close. That doesn't make her any less annoying, but, there's at least no unnecessary frustration. Enemies are actually pretty smart too. They'll move out of the way to avoid getting shot, and will dodge, leap, and climb to get to you.[ - ] Puzzles got dumbed down this time around. This was intentional I believe, since the game was going more run and gun, rather than stop and think. There are quite a few puzzles in the game, but only two I found to be challenging. The rest involved simply finding an item or pushing a button to open whatever door / path that blocked the way.----------------------------------------------------------------- As a kid, this was the first horror game I managed to beat on my own. The reason behind that was because even though this game was scary to me, it was so fun I had to push through and finish it. I went on to beat it over 50 more times on my old GameCube version. A truly great game, and one that should be played by the avid gamer, along with the other classic RE games.  "

												I've been playing this game since 2005.Gamecube - ✔PS2 - ✔Wii - ✔Xbox 360 - ✔Playstation 4 - ✔It's pretty much the perfect action game. Well known for it's brilliant pacing, extremely refined shooting mechanics, and the OCD nightmare that is the inventory system, it changed the RE series by changing the view point to an over the shoulder perspective, rather than static. This is now the standard for pretty much any third person game. Gears of War, Mass Effect, GTA V, The Last Of Us, Uncharted... I could go on. But I won't.GraphicsSolid 1080p, 60/30 FPS modes, AF filters and various texture settings. It still looks pretty clean for a game from 2005.SoundThe original SFX/Music on the Gamecube actually sounded good. However, on nearly every subsequent port they were compressed beyond belief. You'll be pleased to hear these are fully uncompressed. They sound like crap by today's standards, but again, 2005.GameplayShoot Spanish people - Recieve money and ammunition - Buy upgrades and new weapons.It's a simple mechanic, but it really does flow unbelievably well. As I said before, the pacing is incredible. The quieter moments at the start are very quickly offset by dudes with chainsaws and Las Plagas head spiders/crabs, not to mention the frequent areas of respawning enemies.Overall it's still a fantastic game, well worth the purchase price. There is however, a new glitch introduced in this version. Some sort of desync or FPS related problem with the rifle reloads. Turns out they were never coded for 60 FPS, and as a result still plays at 30 FPS, which looks dreadful. But I'm a complete fanboy, and I don't use the rifles anyway.                                                        乁། ˵ ◕ – ◕ ˵ །ㄏ			"

												After the abysmal port that was the PC version of RE4, this new release is fantastic. Customizable keyboard controls as well as controller support with both 'classic' and 'modern' sensitivity modes make the gameplay easy for veterans and newcomers. Constant patches from the devs keep the game improving, and the updated HD looks incredible. This game merges shooting tons of enemies with a huge amount of unlockables. No DLC here; all the content is in the game already, waiting to be unlocked. This game was and still is the prime example of a good video game: great gameplay and great replayability. Buy this if you've beaten it 15 times on previous versions like myself, or if you have never played it before. It will reinvent what you think a video game should be like.			"

												The year was, if I recall right, 2003. I was still pretty young at the time, my sole experience with Resident Evil being this one time I'd tricked my parents into letting me rent Resident Evil 3 for the PS1. My family was poor, and this was the sole mechanism by which I could play games.Now, a few years earlier, the PS2 had come out, and I *really* wanted one. The list price was too much for my parents to bear, and instead, I continued playing that PS1 for long enough that no new games were actually coming out. I actually read a lot of books instead. Then, in 2003, I conned one of them into getting me a PS2. They ****ed up and I got a Gamecube for Christmas instead.At the time I was rather irritated, and proceeded to try and hate the box my mom had purchased me, because I was a little s*** like most early teenagers. It came with a few pack-in games - I forget most of them by now - but one was Super Mario Sunshine. It was mediocre but looked nice. I soon realized most of the available Gamecube games were far nicer visually than the PS2, and decided to combat my poor-ness by flaunting what I had, so to speak. I believe this is how most modern rappers make it big. In that respect, I attempted to become the 50 Cent of white gamers.Problem: the Gamecube had a reputation at my school for being a ""kiddy"" console with ""lame"" games and a distinct lack of Grand Theft Auto. I was very, very upset by this, because like most 90s-00s kids, I wanted to be perceived as cool. And cool in those mewling days meant ""having a game with more bloodshed than the news is permitted to show"". Since the news had allowed footage of mass suicide by that point, I was thoroughly ****ed.I loved the Gamecube in the end, don't get me wrong. I even, by the end of that console gen, managed to buy all three machines. But the Gamecube had the most consistently good first-party titles. Alas, quality of games be damned, Metroid Prime was the closest thing to a ""cool"" game my beloved box had.Now, you might notice I've spent 400 words or so distinctly NOT talking about RE4 in this review of RE4. That's because RE4 wound up being a Gamecube exclusive for a time, and everyone basically loved it the moment it came out. But - more critically in my case - it was the first game with extremely detailed locational damage that I had ever seen. Because I was the only one among my friends to own a Gamecube, they had to briefly eat their words and admit that I had something neat they couldn't. That felt nice for a change.Good news is, RE4 doesn't ride on nostalgia OR the bizarre cultural obsessions of the time I was young. It still plays unlike anything else. It's still moronically paced. It's like living a horror movie as directed by Tommy Wiseau.There is a boss character that is literally a midget stereotype of a Spanish castellan.There is the line ""No Thanks Bro"" uttered without a hint of irony.The thing is, it also has bizarrely satisfying combat and just the right level of cringe to be unashamedly brilliant.I don't really need to harp on why RE4 is good, history's done that for me. This is a reasonable port. It's visually dated but runs fine.Basically, I'm encouraging you to drop $7 on a piece of anti-art this summer sale and enjoy the sort of thing a teenager would use to desperately hide his parents' lack of wealth from his violence-obsessed, moronic friends.The worst part is when I finally managed to play GTA, I found I just didn't ""get"" it.RE4 is way better than my childhood is what I'm really trying to say.

												I've been out of the Resident Evil franchise since 1999, got tired of it after 3 games.The 2014 Capcom Steam Sales rolls in and I see Resident Evil 4 HD is on special.Decided then to buy the entire series and resume where I left off.After playing with it for 38 hours, I. Love. This game. It gives you enough of a 'oh crap, I'm out of ammo! What am I going to do!' before it throws very little ammo at you - just enough to barely survive.Consider me back into the Resident Evil fold. Can't stress enough just how good and worthwhile playing Resident Evil 4 is.Also, be sure to check out the Resident Evil 4 HD Texture upgrade project http://www.re4hd.com/ its doing quite a great job of FULLY updating all the textures (not some, which is what Capcom did. HD textures and SD textures being displayed side-by-side) to HD.At the time of writing, the project only released a first public test release of the Village stage. Based on that, it is a massive step up from what Capcom has provided.			"

												The American prevailing is a cliché that only happens in your Hollywood movies! Oh, Mr. Kennedy, you entertain me! To show my appreciation, I will help you awaken from your world of clichés! Story Six years have passed since the viral outbreak in Raccoon City. The Umbrella Corporation has gone bankrupt due to a crash in stock sales after it is revealed that they are to blame for the incident. Leon S. Kennedy, one of the few survivors of the Raccoon City outbreak, has been trained by the U.S. special forces to protect the president of America and his family. Only on his first day Leon is send to a remote village is Spain, to find the kidnapped daughter of the president. When Leon arrives here he finds out that the villagers of this once peaceful place have turned into mindless 'Ganados', with a strange cult called ""The Los Illuminados"" controlling the villagers. Now Leon must find and rescue the president's daughter and uncover a plot that could lead to ultimate global destruction. Gameplay Unlike its predecessors Resident Evil 4 is an over the shoulder third person action game, with a little bit of survival-horror here and there. Like the other games, you can't walk and shoot at the same time, which for many newcomers might seem annoying but actually makes for a lot of tense moments while fighting the games many enemies. The game is split into three parts and five chapters. With the last part being a bit weaker than the previous two, it's still amazing. The game has a few boss battles, which are all very tense and satisfying to battle. The unlocked Professional mode, is a though challenge, but a lot of fun for hardcore gamers. Conclusion As you can see by the hours that I've played this game, I love it. I played all the Resident Evil games and Resident Evil 4 is the one that made me play all of them. For many Resi ""purists"" this was the death of the series, because of its more action focused gameplay. But for me and many other gamers Resident Evil 4 was a phenomenal game. The story has a fun ""B-Movie"" vibe to it, and the gameplay does need some getting used to, is still a lot of fun once you learned how to control it. 9.5/10  "

												Alright let's get the nonsense out of the way first.As Leon Kennedy, you have to rescue the president's daughter, kill small-time Saddler, and shoot nearly a thousand not-zombies in the face. This is one of the best games ever made.See? Easy peasy fo' sheezy. Millions of people know that this game is totally great, and it's a waste of everyone's time for me to write a long review. Still, I feel obligated to write SOMETHING, because RE4 is that damn good.RE4 is nearly 10 years old now, and it only seems to get better with age. It's a third-person shooter that has managed to carve out the perfect identity. It's the definition of a classic. But why is that? What is it that RE4 does so well that makes it a genre-defining masterpiece?Let's start with something basic, sound-direction. One of the most basic ideas RE4 has is that when enemies are nearby, music plays. When the music stops, that means all of the enemies are dead. This is the moment when you can release that tension. RE4 is also one of those games where you're actively harming yourself by playing music over the in-game tunes. Your view is very limited, and all you really have to keep track of your surroundings are your ears. This isn't something you'll notice in RE5 or RE6 because 95% of the time you have a partner. In RE4 your ears are going to pick up every grunt, every foot-step, every little noise, and it's going to save your life.Speaking of partners, I honestly think Ashley is underrated. Yeah ok ""LEEEOOOOOOOOOOON"" gets obnoxious, but it's to be expected. This girl is way out of her element, and protag is the only person she can trust(and vice-versa I suppose, if you don't count the merchant). There's all sorts of little moments that make her welcome company. Whenever you do something cool like shoot a hatchet out of the air, she does a little fist-pump. If there is an enemy behind you, she's going to notice. She serves as a good distraction, is quick to get behind you or duck under your gun. The most dangerous areas also tend to leave nice places for Ashley to hide. Still, I dunno...maybe I just appreciate when she's around. It's like I'm getting a psychological buff. It's easy to forget that with all the♥♥♥♥♥Leon is kicking, that the situation he and Ashley are in is well and truly screwed. Any moment where it feels like things are going right is worth holding onto.The controls and mechanics still hold up perfectly. While having all the cool diving moves in RE6 is really nice, there's something to be said about methodically evading all sorts of stuff by walking ever so slightly to the side and/or backwards. It really gives you a feel of just how much weight goes into each encounter. Movement is just so focused and creates the right amount of context. Where you stand determines so much of the enemy's behavior.  It's like an arcade beatemup. Sure you can walk right up and punch everyone, but you're bound to take a bunch of damage in the process. The trick is to move around enough so that your foes are ""herded"". They're in the right position and distance for you to deal with them appropriately. Losing track of enemies is dangerous, because they could get behind you, approach your sides, and then it's back to relying on your ears as well as your eyes to restore some sort of order.There's a lot to be said about making do with what you're given, which is where RE4 also shines. A lot of shooters have to push the ""variety"" angle to keep encounters interesting. There's always a new type of enemy, different victory conditions, or just some gimmick. Much of RE4 is spent in combat, and these combat situations are typically Leon in an area surrounded by enemies. Early on he has to rely on blocking doors, throwing down ladders, just to keep enemies at bay. As his arsenal improves he's expected to take fight directly to the enemy, also relying on his advanced maneuverability to stay one step ahead. When old doors close, new ones open, that's what keeps a game engaging, not doing something different at every moment. RE4 knows exactly when to create moments that are actually special, not just different. They're memorable, but unless you're replaying the game you won't have to deal with them again. Whether it's just business as usual or these special moments, the core mechanics and design of RE4 are front and center. It's astonishing just how well Capcom/Mikami gets it.RE4 also features one of the best campaigns of any time. I'd say it's at just the right length. Some would claim that the game runs a bit too long, and that some parts could trimmed or even cut entirely. This is not something I can agree with.  Nothing really feels wasted in this game. Like okay there's a kinda dumb moment where you use a crane to drop enemies into the garbage disposal. This part of the game follows shortly after discovering the regenerators and (hopefully) finding the means to destroy them. Having a goofy little moment where you toss a few las plagas in the garbage is...kinda nice. Pacing isn't always just pushing for everything to move as quickly as possible. Even very late in the game RE4 has time to throw ideas around. Unfortunately, this probably says more about the rushed nature that game development is all too easy prey for. The end levels tend to be pushed together. The only intention is that hopefully everything doesn't fall apart. RE4 had seemingly all the time in the world to get everything right and it shows.Back to what I said about the perfect identity. First off, no disrespect to RE5 and RE6. I really enjoy and love those games as well, but they're not RE4. What makes this game such a classic is not something that can be replicated. Even if you could somehow get prime Mikami and top-of-their-game-era Capcom together again and tasked them with doing a 1:1 sequel to RE4, you'd still end up with a lesser title. RE4 is a product of its time, it has limitations, and in a way it makes those into strengths. Sure I'd be curious to see how RE4 part 2 would play with RE6 controls, but it wouldn't be the same.  I guess conceptually it'd be an improvement, but in practice...I don't think it could work. Leon dashing around like he was in a zombie-infested Vanquish sequel? Yeah not feeling that either.Anyway to sum it all up, play through RE4 again. Appreciate it like you never have before. We'll never see another game quite like it.			"

												THe first (and probably the best) of the ""new"" generation of Resident Evil games and the last one to actually be ""survival-horror"" as far as I'm concerned (and it still doesn't feel quite as frightening as the original trilogy). Still, the series needed a breath of fresh air around when it was released and it updates the combat mechanics of the game while not making it too much like any other shooter game with monsters. It usually pulls off feeling challenging but fair, although there are a few cheap parts where you are almost guaranteed to mess up at least once.The story remains captivating throught the game and serves its purpose of keeping the player engaged although there are a few instances of ""cutscene stupidity"" (mostly involving a certain girl getting captured...multiple times...).There's also a fair bit a latitute as far as weapons go once you get futher into the game, with a variety of pistols, shotguns, rifles and some more specialized weapons you can choose from to suit your playstyle. Each of them has certain strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited.As always, the music stays true to the series standard of setting the mode of each area, becoming mysterious, nervous and frantic at the appropriate times (and of course, some of the most disturbing segements are when it ceases playing entirely).My biggest compaint is probably the overuse of quicktime events both within and outside of cutscenes. This is a personal pet peeve of mine, and I think they often mar some otherwise great games. Sometimes this is tastefully employed in RE 4; however, there is one particular scene late in the game that reveals important information concerning the plot which is basically one continous quicktime event. Suffice to say, if you keep dieing during the same scene it gets old fast. It's pretty safe to say that if you enter a cutscene, you need to be ready to hit buttons "" just in case.""Ultimately, RE 4 is a great game, even if it doesn't follow exactly in the spirit of the earlier titles (although argubably, with 5 and 6 out now that spirit is now irrevocably changed anyway). For instance, you didn't feel like an complte badass like Leon S. Kennedy apparently is with his acrobatics and roundhouse kicks:  each and every foe could mean death in 1-3, while this is only a concern with largish groups of the common mooks in 4. This totally changed the dynamic of the game, and yet 4 somehow still makes it work enough to not completely drain the game of suspense. I've heard 5 and 6 are not nearly as success at this, but I can't speak for them since I haven't played through those (yet).In my mind, I tend to think of 4 as a worthy game that stands on its own and not relate it overly much to the originals except for certain minor plot and references that, honestly, aren't even neccearry and wouldn't even effect the value of the game that much if they weren't there if you think about it honestly (other than to retain the title ""Resident Evil""). For what it is, I enjoy it as one of my favorite all-time action-adventures/horror games (9 out of 10).			"

The apex of the Resident Evil series.As a sequel to a franchise such as Resident Evil (Biohazard), trying to make a game that lives up the expectations is no small task to pursue, and yet, RE4 delivers, big time.When compared to previous titles, it is obvious that RE4 has suffered a massive revamp in the way you see and control the world that surrounds you and the characters that take place in it, previous titles revolved heavily around the use of fixed cameras, whereas the fourth title of the saga changes to a third person view camera, this was one of the boldest moves of the game, since, as it's been previously said, the old titles' use of fixed cameras was an essential part of the way Resident Evil told its story and immersed the player in it, now RE4 threw that out of the window, no more innevitable jumpscares and zombies coming straight at you when you had no much room for maneuravility, RE4 got rid of this, the new camera and aiming gave the player more freedom to move around and have more options to choose as to how to comfront the enemies, aiming is now also a very integral part of your survival in the game, you no longer simply press aim and shoot, you have more variables to consider now, how many enemies are coming at you? do you climb that ladder and retrieve to a higher location or do you stand your ground? do you use your knife and save some bullets in the process? That last question is specially important, as you will see throughout your journey in this weird spanish village, ammunition is no scarce by any means, as there's always a box, barrel or monster that replenishes you with more stuff every few meters along the way, but if you are not careful with how you spend your bullets, you will soon see yourself standing surrounded by a mob armed with torches and pitchforks without much to defend you but a couple of gun magazines and a throwable chicken egg!The story of RE4 is quite ridiculous if you actually stop and think about it for a second, you are Leon S. Kennedy, former Racoon City survivor and police officer, tasked with rescuing the daughter of the president of the United States, all by yourself, from a group of religious cultists ranging from simple peasants to fulll-on zombie wolverines, well, not quite, as you will be explained not so later in the game, these are no common zombies as the ones you were already familiar with, these ones are known as ""Las Plagas"" which works more like a parasitic hive under the control of the cult leader, Osmund Saddler, that appear to have a bit more of grey matter up in there, and let's not even get started with some of the bosses in here, that's just in another level of ridiculousness. But in the end, it doesn't matter, because the game doesn't take itself very seriously, so, why would you? Covered almost fully with a long black trench coat, is the merchant, with emblematic phrases such as ""Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger!"" and ""Stranger, stranger... now that's a weapon"", one of the most mysterious characters in the game, who functions as a shop for the player, where you can sell, buy and upgrade your weapons and stuff you find along the way. The various merchant stands that you'll find all over the place are always a nice and useful spot to get a break and a touch of humour.All in all, a great game that stands strong to this day, and with good reason, it's filled with well-developed, charismatic characters that actually feel alive, as well as outstanding level design. And, while it may have taken away some of the survival horror aspects of the original titles, it has given us so much more in its place, an amazing world with a gameplay so fluid you'll feel like you float your way to the end, and most importantly, never losing its soul in the process, unlike what can be said about numbers 5 & 6 of the series, but hopefully RE7 goes back to the right path.If you somehow, after all these years haven't played this masterpiece in any of the numerous versions it's had in various console generations and on PC, please make yourself a favor and buy this (also, free your schedule for the next couple of days),it will be money well spent.Final note: there's an unofficial project from a couple of guys that has taken it upon themselves to retexture the whole game using original real world sources, it currently isn't finished but you can already download the files corresponding to the village part of the game, if you do mind about graphics, this provides quite a significant improvement, even for this ""HD"" version, which it is fully compatible with. If you are interested in this, you can easily google for it: re4hd.			"

												Originally released for the GameCube in 2005 and now bringing all its glory to Pc/Steam users in HD and smoothness 60 fps.Every now and then a game comes along that within the first minute of playing it you know it's going to be something truly special. To say that Resident Evil 4 is the greatest thing to happen to survival-horror games in 2005 and... since it's creation is a bold statement and one that can be backed up by the quality of the game at hand. Resident Evil 4 is the end all, be all that the genre has strived for since its inception and is a fond love letter not just to fans of action or survival-horror but to people that simply like to play games.Frenetic action and giant boss battles aside, where Resident Evil 4 succeeds, as a survival-horror game isn't so much that it's a frightening game, though there are moments where you will be scared, but its haunting atmosphere. Resident Evil 4 will send chills through your spine as its atmosphere takes center stage against seemingly impossible odds as you go off in search of the President's daughter. The game has the right feel to it, it does have it's action go to the forefront as it's greatest strength but it never lets the action get in the way of the atmosphere and the mood. The two combine together to make Resident Evil 4 one of the most masterful games ever made and an example of how to do the genre justice without abandoning what makes it a survival-horror game.You will be lost in Resident Evil 4's game world for at least twenty hours and you will be compelled to play through it again, either on harder difficulties or with all of your previous items in tow for the second go around. The game is truly fantastic and is well worth a purchase today for those who have never played it if only to see how it's influenced games like Dead Space and Gears of War in different ways.Overall: Whether you're a fan of Resident Evil, the survival-horror genre, action games, adventure games or simply good games, Resident Evil 4 has all the bases covered. This is the kind of game that comes along once in a console-generation and it needs to be experienced. It's a bold statement to call a game one of the all time greatest ever made but I can make that claim with Resident Evil 4 and have no reservations about it.			"

												Trying to review Resident Evil 4 in a modern video game environment is almost unfair in a way, as though it was hugely influence when it released, after so many years the mechanics and tone is pioneered have been replicated and refined so many times over that in comparison it’s hard for RE4 to really stack up. It’s not a bad game by any means, but playing it for the first time so long after release many elements come off as unpolished, clunky, unnecessary and occasionally incredibly frustrating. All the same if you manage to get past the many fumbles it makes, the experience at its core is still something rather incredible, with an amazing sense of place and some of the most satisfying combat you’re likely to find to this day.Opening with a brief history of the events leading up to RE4, we follow Leon Kennedy as he travels to a remote village in Spain on a mission to rescue the president’s kidnapped daughter. Upon arrival, he’s greeted with the welcoming screams of mutated cult worshipers and the roar of chainsaws, as the area around him quickly descends into murderous chaos that only grows stronger the closer he gets to whatever is awaking him at its core.To say the plot in RE4 rapidly jumps around in tone would be a bit of an understatement, but instead of being to the degradation of its narrative (or often lack of one) it actually ends up working remarkably well at keeping the plot engaging and entertaining as it transitions from horror to action by the end. That’s not to say it's without its problems, as the oodles of plot holes, stereotypical characters (of which the female ones exist as little more than sex appeal and a way to squeeze in some ridiculous boob physics), and rarely explained backstory can attest, it manages a cheese ball charm that few games manage to pull off with such dramatic alterations taking place throughout the campaign and one of the reasons I think RE4 is so endearing in a lot of ways. It seems almost intentionally dumb, inviting you to laugh along with it and try not to read anything into it.RE4’s combat is easily its biggest asset, though also where the majority of its problems become such an annoyance, being at once an incredibly visceral, impactful, and brutal event where every bullet makes an impact, but also an awkward and consistently annoying undertaking do to the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor controls and horrendous menu system. It’s an incredible feeling to see a shot connect in RE4, to see the result of a bullet that you can’t afford to lose, as you scramble to take down hordes of resilient enemies often in cramped corridors with little in the way of cover. In the heat of the moment RE4 is brilliant, with the slow movement of enemies (which in any other game would be immensely dull, but here buy you crucial seconds to reload and relocate yourself) providing a combat experience I’ve never found in a game. It’s deliberate and intense despite its slower pace than many games, and makes each and every encounter satisfying and engaging, ramping up to some of the most impressive boss fights I’ve ever seen in a game (as well as a few of the worst).But on the flip side there is everything that, perhaps a decade or so was easily overlooked for all that RE4 does right, but now becomes a glaring blight on the game that seeps into every area of the experience and makes it a lesser game than it could have been. Having to open the menu to switch weapons in the heat of battle is extremely jarring and annoying, pulling me out of the experience each and every time as I fumbled to select the weapon I wanted before closing the menu and trying to find my bearings again. Doubling up on this are is the constant wart on the Resident Evil series’s face: tank controls with button mappings that all but require you to entirely relearn how to play a third person shooter, and become a recurring issue that only worsens the longer you play as enemies become stronger. I eventually became acclimated to them, but there shouldn’t be a need for that. Having to spend hours trying to wrap my head around an unintuitive control scheme and make do with what limited mobility I’m given isn’t fun, and should never be a requirement for someone to play a game well.The unlockable side missions that star your sexy, mysterious, but otherwise entirely nondescript blank slate of a companion, Ada, are the biggest testament to this. Taking double the damage of Leon, combat becomes an intensely frustrating affair where running away was often a more viable option than trying to fight enemies that you barely have time to turn around and shoot before they kill you in two hits. It’s also comprised almost entirely of abysmal mission objectives strewn throughout areas you’ve already played through, and ending with what could easily be two of the worst bosses I’ve ever encountered in a video game. Perhaps it’s unfair to pin these failings on the entire game, but in terms of content outside of the core campaign, the Ada missions are a huge missed opportunity and a horrible experience that no one should put themselves through. They add nothing, and you would be better forgetting they are even there.But if I can look beyond my mountain of criticism at so many areas of the game, there is still so much that RE4 does that makes it a game worth playing, though far from the masterpiece it might have been so many years ago. The atmosphere, brilliant sense of place, and fantastic combat still create an experience that’s hard to pull yourself out of despite all its flaws, and often makes it easy to look past many of them because just those parts are so amazingly done. RE4 isn’t the best game I’ve ever played, and there are things about it that if I ever have to see in a game again it will be too soon, but I don’t regret my time with it and if you’ve also neglected it up until now there’s still definitely something great here to witness, though for how much longer I couldn’t say.On the PC port:After the trainwreck that was the first RE4 PC version, it’s a welcome relief that Capcom has come out with something that’s not only playable, but possibly the best version of the game...in most regards. Despite improved KB/M controls, textures, and a higher frame rate, they failed both at optimizing the game for a large variety of hardware, and created new issues by tying the game speed to the frame rate. I experienced consistent slowdown on a machine that ought to be more than capable of running it, and as a result often had audio desync from cutscenes, occasional freeze ups, and a general lesser visual experience having to turn down most of the limited options just to get a stable frame rate (which even then seemed to fluctuate wildly for no apparent reasons). It’s a disappointment, but in many ways this is still a great version of the game provided you far exceed the recommended requirements, and happen to be lucky as the performance issues seem largely random with who they affect.

												Ah. Classic Capcom writing.So they send a single dude to save the American president's daughter. Sounds why bother with more. The guy arrives at a village and immediatelly starts murdering the locals. Like, straight up genocide. The villagers wield axes, scythes, pitchforks and knives, but to no avail. Later the villagers also use crossbows, dynamite sticks, RPGs, chainguns and electric batons. The USA doesn't care. You don't care either - just kill everyone. After genociding like 700 people you decide to request for backup, but the radio signal is being jammed. At some point America decides that they should probably check on the guy and the kidnapped president's daughter (I mean just in case, not a big deal tho), so they send *one guy* with a heli. The heli gets immediatelly shot down by the terrorist RPG wielding villagers.By the end of the game you will have killed over a thousand infected people and saved the president's daughter pretty much single-handedly, after being mocked by the main antagonist that ""americans saving the day"" only happens in hollywood.I don't even, Capcom.

												This game is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time. I have it on Gamecube,PS2,PS4,Xbox 360 and PC. It is in the top ten of my favorite games. This game has the most replay value out of any game i have played because the gameplay is just so damn fun. I come back to this game whenever i dont have anything to play. The game gets really difficult but it the feeling is so rewarding when you get past these parts. 10/10 would buy for a 6th time.			"

												Note: This is my first review of a game on steam (this is also aimed towards people who have never played this game). I hope you find it useful as to whether or not to purchase this game!I should probably make it clear that this is the only version of the game I have played. I have had no experience with any other versions, and one of the first games I purchased after finishing my new build. I was at first a bit skeptical about buying Resident Evil 4. It didn't seem like the type of game I would be interested in. It's old, cheesy (as I found out as I played), and referred to as the game which killed the series. Because of this, I never really considered to play it. I thought it would be a waste of time, money, and an overall dissapointment.I was wrong. I was so extremely wrong.To be honest, I don't really know why I even bought this masterpiece. I never do spend much, so it felt strange purchasing this. (Actually, it was the drought of 2014 which probably did it! And don't worry, Shadow of Mordor, you're an exception!) Anyway, I jumped right into the game right after it finished downloading. At first, It felt really strange. The controls felt awkward, even with the use of my Xbox 360 controller. Only a few minutes in, and I was thrown into the action. I felt vulnerable and angry that the camera never really seemed to do what I wanted it to. After dying several times by means of an axe to the face, a pitchfork from behind, and of course, those God forsaken bear traps, I finally made it to this quaint village in ""rural europe"" which totally in no way seems familiar to Spain on any degree whatsoever, only to meet dozens of infected villagers and chainsaw guy. From that moment on, I absolutely fell in love. Every shot, suplex, ridiculous one liner, and plagas made me love it more and more. So much that I completed it again, and again, and again, and some more. Sure, It doesn't have the graphical fidelity of modern games today, or an amazing story to go along with it. But my God, it is FUN.Well, I guess this wasn't really a great review, or a review at all. Just a love letter to one of my favorite games of all time. I know I didn't cover all aspects of the game and how much it got right (pacing, for example), but by know I think you probably got an idea how I feel about Resident Evil 4. If you haven't bought this game by now, I strongly urge you to do so, and a Pro-Tip before I sign off:Never reload the Broken Butterfly, the Merchant has your back!!!			"

												Editorial incoming!I don't even know where to start....So this is the game that caused the shift.  But seriously, how major a shift was it? In my opinion, it wasn't much...but it was just enough. Apparently as history tells us, the fanbase had gotten tired of fixed camera angles and the bird eye view of the series. Resident Evil: Code Veronica wasn't enough. So Capcom came up with this....It's been around 17 years since I last saw Leon, and I must say that it was great to see him. He has come a long way from his one rookie cop day. Now he is on a mission to save the President's daughter, Ashley.  Doesn't sound like a zombie game to me. In fact it turned out to be more terrifying than zombies. Some people may call this an action horror, but I say that this is still survivor horror. Maybe that is because I was trying to juggle killing willing villager test subjects and learning the new controls at the same time! The controls....I hated them, but I learned them. I hated the fact that the keyboard controls pretty much everything from Leon's movement to the movement of the camera. At times, the over the shoulder view really threw me off, especially since enemies can surround you, and its hard to get a good aim. However, over time, the controls became more familiar. Good my ranting for the controls are over. The game nails the feeling of hopelessness and claustrophobia. Yes Leon is no longer a rookie and he has guns and he can knife stuff and kick stuff, but ammo is scarce and he is one against an army - and what an army it is. Villagers bent to kill you, flying insects that feel that they were taken from the world of H.P. Lovecraft (the migo, look them they are terrifying), regenerators (just run! just run!), spiky regenerators (AAAHHH! Run faster!!) Plus there are traps EVERYWHERE. You hardly get to breathe, except when the illusive shopkeeper who looks like a black market vendor shows up. I have never been so happy to see a vendor in my life. He sells weapons, upgrades, and items, for a price of course. Now when I got used to the controls and the camera view, I really appreciated the use of the camera, or should I say the tightness of it. In classic Resi, the camera was fixed, making looking aroudn the corner not possible, unless you turned the corner. In RE4, the camera is close, making you feel claustrophobic. Sometimes the camera does go for a bit of bird eye view, depending on your location, but the tight feeling never left.Now the story, villains, and dialogue are all classic RE. It is scary, but cheesy. It's over the top, and I loved that. The herbs, typewriters (sans ink ribbon thank goodness), and files are all there for the collecting. Also, the puzzles are still there! They may be a lot simpler (who really wants to go through water treatment puzzle difficulty?!), but they are still present. You cannot continue until keys are found and puzzles are solved. But there is something new! There are treasures to collect for extra money. Trust me you'll be glad to went to the trouble to get those treasures so that you can afford those very necessary gun upgrades and special weapons.I just want to give a special mention to the reappearance of Ada Wong. With all new villains, and an ongoing escort mission of Ashley, it was a welcome sight to see the double playing agent. As I was struggling to get a grasp of the game, the sight of Ada let me know that it was still RE and Leon and Ada were back at it. Speaking of Ashley, just how annoying is she. Very annoying but in an endearing kind of way. She can't defend herself at all, making that already tense situation even worse since you have to protect her. The times when they are separated was a welcome change...unless I was controlling Ashley. Thats right you get to play as Ashley at times, and that is just scary, since she gets no weapons and she has to outmaneuver enemies. Have fun! Now the negatives...and there aren't that many. In fact its just one! I love that after beating the final boss, there is a self destruct sequence! YAY! However, its not enough to beat the enemy in time. Oh no, that would be too familiar. You have to escape via jetski the island that is about to explode. Yeah..who likes to beat the final boss only to die via minigame?! This to me was ridiculous. You have to maneuver a very fast jet ski while debri is falling all around you. One piece hits you and its over. Luckily, you can start over right at the minigame, but still to have the final test be a minigame and not a big bad boss really rubbed me wrong. Now would I call this the best game of the RE series? For me, no.....but it is really fun. The direction is different but is still retains the elements that make Resident Evil classic. As I play through the rest of the series, I'll see if this new story arc is worth exploring.			"

Your quest in this game is to kill the not-zombies and rescue your gucci™ coat from the evil Bitores Mendez, who knocks you out and steals it within the first few hours of the game.It's a tragic rollercoaster of loss, love, and saying no to drugs.

												First off, this is a very good game.  One of my favorites actually.  So I recommend the game itself.  Just, don't buy this version if you have Windows 10.  The game crashes without fail after an undetermined amount of time playing.  For a game where save points are supposed to be far from each other to build tension, this is a huge problem.  I've tried running in compatability mode, running as an administrator, running on the lowest settings, and a combination of some or all of these.  It just does not work on Windows 10 and apparently Capcom has abandoned support for this game.  If you have Windows 10, you're better off buying any other version on using an emulator to play the GameCube, PS2, or Wii version.  I love this game, but it is unplayable on Windows 10.			"

Alot better then the ps2 that's for sure. It's definitely more fluid.The control's are fine, but you'll want to use a xbox controller.My only negative view about this is there only 12 achievment's......TWELVE! Why?!  RE 0, 1 , 5, 6, revelations 1 and 2 all have at least 30+ achievment's... I can think of several more achievment's capcom could of put in this remake.Try to look up ashley's skirtGet decapitated by a chainsawFind all treasure'sCombine 3 small treasure's in one (beerstein, mask, crown etc)Find all blue medallion'sUpgrade a weapon to it's maxUnlock the infinite rocket launcherGet 1000 headshot'sKill salazar with a rocket launcherGet leon and ashley's health maxed using yellow herbsSave the dog from the bear trapBlock 50 arrow's with the knifeKill the traderOutrun the giant boulder Sell 10 G,R,Y herb vial'sSell a fully upgraded weaponRemove the parasite's from Leon and ashleyComplete seperate way's and assignmet adaBut maybe im just being finicky...Overall if your nostalgic or just trying to scratch that RE 4 itch, I highly recommend this game.

												I was very excited for this HD remake to a Capcom Classic make its way to Steam. However, there are a few issues with the game at the moment, that make it totally unplayable for me.  My PC specs are more than enough to play the game, and I checked that my video card was the primary GPU that the game was using. I was so Sad to get in game and experience alot of these problems that will hopefully get patched at a later date._____________________________Problems with the Game at the moment:_____________________________-Game feels un-optimized for PC-Will Run Slow/Normally at random points-Character Animations will slowdown-Running will cause you to move slowly.  (you play a running animation but it's slowed down)-Certain Areas of the game will speed up/run normally/run slow depending on where you are standing/where camera is facing.-Quicktime events will slowdown. (jumping out of windows, cutscene events, etc)-Texture load error with certain enemies (will appear as these black blobs with ""texture printed on them"")-Widescreen support feels like it puts your character and aiming out of alignment-Mouse support is not all that great, laser reticule will sometimes flicker on and off an enemy. ____________Pros:____________Ashley's Panties in 1080p HD.Joking Aside, I don't recommend buying the PC port of the game if you use an ATI or AMD graphics processor at the moment, as there are too many compatability issues._________________________________________________________Edits: 03/17/2014_________________________________________________________-Patch was released that fixes a few things and adds some extra options to tweak your game/settings.-Aiming controls can now be switched from classic mode to ""Modern mode"" that tracks your mouse much better than before. Aiming is now sexy with this enabled. -need verification if the 60 fps setting still slows down for other cards, however the game has run smoothly on my machine.			"

												I remember back in 2006 I first got this game from my grandmother as a gift for Easter... lol one of the best gifts ever!So where do I begin with this masterpiece of a game... this game went through 3 different revisions that you can look up for yourself until it was released back in 2005 exclusivly for the Nintendo Gamecube until Capcom screwed them over and released on every other platform-honestly a good reason-and I bought multiple different versions of this. (got it on PS2 first, played on Xbox, played the hell out of the Wii version, and now the best version: PC HD release!)Story: After the events of RE3: Nemesis, Leon Scott Kennedy is now an agent for the U.S. Government is sent on a mission to rescue the president's daughter Ashley Graham from an unknown organization that's located in Europe. When Leon arrives in a rural area of Europe to discover some bizarre villagers that are attacking him. It then leads to give you some creepy events that you will have find out how the villagers came to be and rescue Ashley.Gameplay: You may know this game is responsible for revolutionizing the 3rd-person shooter genre and making it a standard today and it still lives up to it. Though without a doubt the gameplay does feel dated since you can't move the camera as you would expect from a modern 3rd-person shooter as well as move while aiming, reloading, and shooting. Aiming might feel clunky since you are always swaying your gun around even when standing still and moving around might be strange but you will get use to after a while. Weapons can be upgraded and bought from a merchant with the games currency to give you a better arsenal or even change your gameplay style of what weapons you want to use for your playthrough. The inventory is probably my most favorite inventory mechanic in a video game I have ever used. It's basically a suit case-which can be upgraded-which is were you store all of your items into including ammo, healing items, and attachments for weapons. It's an entire grid array so you can fit many items into but also make you decide if you should take certain items with you or not since you won't have enough space. Also the game has a NG+ to keep all your items and weapons upgrades to give you replay value.Survival Horror: This game can give you the creeps at the start making you say ""what the h*ll is going here"", and leaves it to you to figure out what's happened. Most can be told through documents you find throughout the game and gives interesting plot points. The toughnest of the enemies as well as being out numbered by them and managing your ammo and healing items can make it a tense survival game. Boss fights can be challenging if you don't manage your inventory well enough and they have amazing designs that makes them seem very powerful. Seeing some of the creepy enemy designs latter on in the game will make your skin crawl. Though it can be argued that the game does get way more actioned focused close to the end but for the most part until 3/4 through the game it remains to be a survival horror game and one of the best ever as well.Sound/Music: Gun sounds still sound good to this day and some creature's sound design can sound scary at times. The game's soundtrack does some relaxing music and even some that is really fitting for certain moments in the game whether it would be for a creepy sewer setting or a big enemy base.Graphics: Now you have to understand that this game was originally released back in 2005 for the Gamecube so you have to expect to look outdated which of course they are. Though it does have a few graphics options that does make it look better than any other version but it still does look outdated. Though you do play at higher resolution than the other platforms and this game performs very well and pretty much stays at 60fps consitently. In case if you are interested there is an HD rework project for this game that you can try out for yourself to help give the game better textures.PC port: If you remember the original PC version of RE4 was REALLY BAD. It had no mouse aiming and terrible graphics compared to other versions and was pretty much unplayable. Now with this re-release it's the PC version that we deserved! Decent graphics options, good M&K controls, full gamepad support, and beautiful consitent 60fps performance. You honestly can run this game maxed at get 60fps on a good budget PC and it will run great. No crashes throughout the entire time I played this game as well.Conclusion: So you could probably tell that this is definitly one of my favorite games EVER! It helped set the standard for 3rd-person shooters and survival horror as we know it today. Sure the graphics are outdated and look very flat and muddy but it doesn't pass up for how amazing the gameplay is. The survival horror is still intense compared to other games these days and nothing has come close to match what this masterpiece of a game has made. This will forever remain as Shinji Mikami's masterpiece work of art and it has made him one of the most important video game creators of all time and he is very deserved.Rating 10/10 12/10 I would get this game from Easter again! ;)			"

												I have only a few games I find myself constantly coming back to and Resident Evil 4 happens to be one of them. Years and years ago when I first played it I had such a bad computer that the game kept lagging badly even on the lowest possible settings. But I didn't mind because I had such a good time.The story begins when special agent Leon S. Kennedy, a survivor of Raccoon City, is given a task of finding the daughter of United State's president. She was kidnapped by unknown assailants and taken somewhere deep within Spain. Our hero Leon arrives to the destination but comes to learn the hard way that his mission is yet again going to be anything but simple. Except this time he will not face zombies but villagers entagled in a strange cult.RE4 become well-known for its change of direction compared to previous games. Moving a little away from horror the gameplay features more action and gunplay. Point of view also changed from fixed camera angles to third-person to better reflect the big transformation. Though there are lots more enemies and bullets than before, you can't be wasteful with your items and hence the survival horror. Inventory management is  necessary and your Tetris skills will come handy.Some fans of the original Resident Evil games didn't like what the franchise was shaping up to be; major concern that the charming horror is changing to typical action. I can understand this perfectly well as someone who has seen their beloved video games change into something I didn't like them for. But at the same time I really love RE4 and its different gameplay. I like the balance of horror and action (although admittedly there's less of the horror). One chapter you're shooting groups of crazy villagers and dodging their axes and dynamites, and then some other chapter you're getting ambushed behind a corner by a really creepy, red-eyed monster which can regenerate its limbs. I don't find the game scary but the atmosphere is intense and spooky. And no matter how many times I have played, the red-eyed monsters Regenerators still manage to make me feel nervous and uncomfortable.And the gameplay has various elements to keep it interesting: you kill different enemies in different locations (very well designed enemies), solve some puzzles to get a reward or open a passage (not too many and not too hard, often very subtle like a mechanism to open a door), find treasure and money to buy and upgrade weapons (who doesn't like to buy stuff) and slay a few bosses along the way. And after you've played through the campaign once you unlock a bunch of mini-games if you're left wanting more.While I absolutely love RE4, I can say it is not without a few grivances. The top 20 ""Most annoying characters in video game history"" has to include the subject of your rescue, Ashley. You have to escort this defenseless, complaining, adult-acting-like-a-child around while protecting both of your lives. I'm sure many have felt the same as I have, wanting to shut her up with a bullet even if it results in a game over.The Steam version is supposed to be the best version out of them all, which by now there's so many (GameCube, PS2, Wii etc), but it isn't as good as it should be for an 'Ultimate HD Edition'. The 60 frames per second is a huge plus, and in my opinion the best thing to come out of this edition, but there's a couple of bad things to list. Textures still look very awful because they didn't bother to upgrade them properly, unlike the two guys on the forums who are in a process of doing it on their free time. And I really would like to know why there's no subtitles if the language is set in English, only if it's in any other language. For personal reasons subtitles are a must for me and it's always a disappointment to find there's none. Lastly, the controls definitely take time to get used to. RE4 differs in many ways from the previous games and you have more freedom than before with the aiming and the camera, but everything still feels quite tanky. This can deter some people as controls are perhaps the most important part of any video game. I can't say what it's like playing with a keyboard and a mouse but with a Xbox 360 controller I didn't have much trouble.But at the end of the day Resident Evil 4 reinvented the franchise in a way which made me, and many others, fall in love with it and time and time again it has been considered as one of the best video games of all time. Even today it holds up well and I don't think I'll ever stop liking it. The port isn't the greatest, and it needed more work, but the gameplay is fun and advanced for its time. If you can get past the weird controls at least at first, I hope you can enjoy playing as much as I have.Personal Rating: 10/10 "

												Resident Evil 4, is actually the Sixth game in the Resident Evil series and was released in 2005. Resident Evil 4 is a Third-Person shooter/Horror game where you play once again as Leon Kennedy, the protagonist from Resident Evil 2, who is on a mission from the President of the United States to rescue his kidnapped daughter from a group of cultists. Upon arriving at a local village you encounter townspeople who worship and are infected by a virus called, Las Plagas. Not to go further into the plot, Resident Evil 4 takes place Six years after the events at Racoon City. Resident Evil 4 has won many awards and has been an influence for other, more modern games. Even though it is starting to show it's age when compared to newer titles, Resident Evil 4 is still a good playthrough. I recommend if you enjoy the Resident Evil series, or horror/shooters in general to give Resident Evil 4 a playthrough. The story is interesting and furthers the canon of the overall Resident Evil Universe.  "

												This rushed port would have been acceptable if they at least had the courtesy to optimise the game to run at a decent speed. Aiming is atrocious thanks to the game converting mouse inputs into analogue x/y (controller inputs), leading to a ridiculous amount of negative mouse acceleration leaving me to fight with the controls. The Menus and general user interface remains almost untouched from its roots  yet  this is on a PC now, using wasd to manage my inventory is very tedious when I have a perfectly good mouse (added convenience from a mouse interface would be a grand selling point). However the greatest failure is the slowdown, the moment I walk into the opening village the game begins to dramatically chug as though Leon is walking on the surface of the moon, I look away from enemies and instantly the game pics up. This is unacceptable for a full released game costing £15 and renders the experience sickening (The option for 120 fps would be appreciated considering vice city had it back in 2003).It’s still Resident Evil 4 and that fact is what truly makes this so heart breaking, I would love to be able to just play this game in all of its chainsaw fleeing monster freezing glory but seeing it in this state is truly pathetic. Give me quality non accelerated mouse input, provide a UI optimised for mouse and keyboard for your pc port and spend the time to optimise the game for your user base. "

												Edit: This review used to be based on how I bought the game multiple times, and although I hadn't spent many hours on this version of the game, the PC version, I recommended it. Now that I've finally gone through the game again, I can make a real review and I still recommend this a ♥♥♥♥ ton, now even more. While the mouse and keyboard controls are a bit weird for me, I'm someone who played this on a Gamecube, PS2, PS3, and a bloody Wii remote so I'm just used to controllers after a decade of capcam re-re-re-releasing this game. Besides that, and the fact that the cutscenes for Ada's campaign are not at 1080p for some odd reason (everything else in the game, including the cutscenes for Leons campaign, are in 1080p60fps like usual) there isn't really anything to compl-""LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOON!!! HAAAAAAALLLLPPPP!!!""Sorry, had to throw that in there, because Ashley is so damn annoying. But yeah, besides those points, I love this game. It is once again my favorite Resident Evil game, and one of my favorite games ever made, with a very well done port. I had no issues while playing this game, which is odd because on some other reviews people with PC rigs $1000-$2000 more expensive than mine have problems. My guess is those people are having issues on their own end, not with the game itself, because this game runs fine for me on both my AMD and my Intel+Nvidia computers with no problem. So the game itself - you're the best character Capcom ever created, Leon S. Kennedy, and you've been sent to find the Presidents Daughter, all by yourself, as your very first assignment. She's been kidnapped by a cult that has awakened the ""Las Plagas"", a much different virus than the one in Resident Evil 1-3, where instead of being zombies they're monsters, being controlled by the main enemy, Lord Saddler. He aims to take over the entire world with this power, and seeks to do it by using the Presidents daughter to slowly take over and influence him, eventually controlling the entire government and from there the rest of the world. If you're a player of the older Resident Evil games, there's also...a few other characters for you to see that you'll love to see in this game. Since this has been out over a decade though, I will go ahead and say it's Ada Wong, Wesker although only through a few calls in Ada's story, and Krauser, who has become an enemy. The enemies, the levels, the boss fights AND designs, they're all perfect, especially the horrific ones that game me nightmares as a child, and the worst one for me have always been the Regenerators, which regenerate the damage you keep trying to cause them and have the most disgusting faces ever made while the try to eat you. Their breathing, and the OST made just for them, don't help. You don't need to play the other Resident Evils to enjoy this one, as it gives you a brief explantion of Leons earlier events in Resident Evil 2. You can jump into this ready to be scared, probably not as bad as I was my first time playing since I was in 3rd or 4th grade, and ready to have a great experience. Sure the controls are tanky, but when this first released back in 2005 on the Gamecube that was the best we got, and we're all lucky that this game was ever made, because originally this was apparently going to be a Devil May Cry game. Yeah, not sure how that would have worked out, but Capcom started realizing it during development and changed it to be a continuation of the Resident Evil series so I guess they didn't know how that would have worked out either. I'd give this game 5/5 blunts, with an extra pipe loaded just for the nostalgia.			"

												I've played through every Resident Evil / Biohazard game that Capcom's spewed out from 1-6 and other series (Outbreak, Survivor, etc), but this one tops it as my #1 favorite. It's quite a lengthy experience (in a positive way), excellent pacing, treasure hunting, resource managing, minigames, and a load of extra content that triples the replayability of this game by adding various unlockables from costumes to new guns! All of this packed in a $19.99 pricetag makes it all worthwhile; especially if you pre-purchased the game because it comes with even more extras like the full digital OST.Controls are a bit more difficult if you don't take advantage of the game's controller support, but it's a great way to improve your dexterity with the keyboard / mouse and I'm already rocking my foes without a controller at this point!However......This so called 'HD' port has its share of problems.For starters, there is no real significant graphical improvement to the game. The textures and environments look about the same as their Gamecube / PS2 counterparts, blurry and pixelated. What the hell Capcom, why are you bragging so much about SD / HD comparisons here when there really is no significant difference?Plus the game has the tendancy of slowing down like in the matrix if you play with a fixed 60 FPS setting for most people like me (playing at a fixed 30 FPS resolves the issue, but completely undermines the '60 FPS' this port brags about), which is a real problem especially when you're watching cutscenes; it desyncs the action from the voices & sound pretty badly.Capcom claims this is due to 'Hardware' inferiority, but if I can play games like RAGE or ARMA at relatively high settings with 60+ FPS, and this 'HD' port of Resident Evil / Biohazard 4 slows down when there's even a tiny splash of pixelated water from a puddle just goes to show that Capcom needs to get into gear to better optimize the game, and stop making excuses! This game is nearly 10 years old, how demanding can a game like this be?Despite these problems I've pointed out, I still recommend the game because Capcom's going to have to address the issues sooner or later considering the fact that a majority of people like me experience these issues. Plus it's still very much playable and has a lot of content for the value.			"

Product received for free
												First of all, despite having 'received this product for free', that only applies to this specific Steam version, which I gladly would have paid for. I won it in a giveaway when it was first released here, and I had planned on buying it otherwise, so please don't let that aspect taint your thoughts on this review. This is actually my 5th time owning Resident Evil 4 (1st = Gamecube / 2nd = PS2 / 3rd = Wii / 4th = Xbox 360). I can't get enough. It's easily in my top 5, free copy or not, and for good reason. Why is it so good?It's a fun gameplay loop within a gameplay loop. Moment-to-moment, you use satisfying weapons to take out murderous villagers in satisfying ways. Shooting at their legs, and then coming in for the kick, and THEN knifing them when they're down (to save ammo) is a lot of fun, especially when you're trying that tactic with more than a few villagers. With quite a few variances, you're more or less doing that for most encounters.The larger gameplay loop is, once you beat the game, you get to keep your upgraded weapons, with a few more open to purchase. You get to be extremely overpowered, and it's incredibly cathartic to revisit previously-difficult encounters without a worry or care as you exact revenge. One-shotting bosses, laying waste to large groups of enemies without concerning yourself with ammo conservation, and being able to zip through otherwise long and tedious sequences is incredible, and keeps me coming back for more.And that's just the main campaign! In addition to that, you've got two side stories featuring Ada Wong, with slight changes in gameplay, and the Mercenaries mode, which is Resident Evil 4's take on a Horde mode, of sorts. Limited time, unlimited enemies, see if you can stay alive until the helicopter arrives. The incentive to beat all of these extras comes in the form of even more upgraded/powerful weaponry and costumes (Ashley in the Knight suit for life) for the main campaign.I can't recommend it enough.

												OK, so I'm guessing you've heard about this game. How it's so important, it changed third-person shooters and survival horror forever, yada yada yada. But is it really still worth playing today?Hell yes.After a disappointing experience with RE5, I had just assumed Resident Evil wasn't for me. I could not have been more wrong. This game is amazing. The combat still holds up. Although it might look boring since you can't move and shoot, it's actually one of the most intense games I've played. A single mistake can ruin everything, but you can always recover through a bit of luck and careful shooting. The AI isn't brilliant, but it's still really good, better than many modern games I could name.The HD visuals look really nice. Each weapon is well balanced and serves it's own niche. There are a couple issues, of course. You need a big CPU if you want to run at 60 FPS, and not all the textures have been updated, leaving some rough patches in the scenery. And the cutscenes in Seperate Ways haven't been changed at all. The voice acting and plot are hilariously bad. But all in all, this game is incredibly fun. It's aged surprisingly well, and this edition puts an extra coat of polish on an already fantastic purchase. Even if you don't consider yourself a survival horror fan, you will probably enjoy this game.What are you waiting for? Buy it now!			"

												I think anything I could say about Resident Evil 4 could be easily summed up by the fact that the Steam release is maybe the 5th time I've purchased it. It somehow still manages to hold up, even over RE5 for me. If somehow you haven't played RE4 yet then the Steam version is a pretty good one to buy I suppose, though be careful because it's kinda optimised a little poorly.			"

												The most dificult balance in horror games is how to give the player agency, yet make them feel terrified to move. To give power while making you feel powerless. This game accomplishes that.1. Maintains a dirty ambiance, making you feel grose.2. During combat the music and audio shifts, driving the player to want to find every enemy as quickly as possible just to make it stop.3. An intuitive inventory that limits what you can carry based on the relative size of every item you carry, forcing you to decide between carrying more ammo & grenades or more healing herbs.4. Making ammo and healing scarce so that the player can never go in guns blazing and must aim their shots.5. Using a combat system that is good enough to get the job done, but clunky enough to add the the fear of the situation. You do not run and gun, you run or gun.6. Generating stretch goals that reward you for playing the game multiple times on higher difficulties because you slogged through the game counting each bullet, now its time to use a rocket launcher with infinite ammo to show those zombies what for!I played this when it first came out on the GameCube and it is still terrifying today. Definitely worth the old hype and worthy of anyone's time!			"

												For the 7th time Capcom has milked the cash cow that is Resident Evil 4, as they continue to ♥♥♥♥♥ this series like a pie from looney toons using a finger to draw everybody in. But thats just it, it may be the same kinda pie that we've had before, but it still tastes pretty damn good, and its just the way we like it. A true classic, Resident Evil 4 remains one of Capcom's highest payed hookers, and though she hasn't learned too many new things, she knows exactly where to touch you. 9/10			"

												Story: This game doesn't get enough credit for it's story. It's fun, highly-unrealistic, and action-packed. Characters are also unique and pretty awesome. Sound: Music for this game is pretty good. It's slow at the non-action sections and then hypes up when the enemies start coming. Voice acting is fantastic. Though, one certain voice will haunt you forever.Gameplay: So good. For those not use to it, the controls will feel odd and you WILL have trouble moving around and fighting at first. However, the controls are made to be this way. It helps give it that survival horror feel and requires the player to use more skill and such. You will get used to them in 20 minutes. And, even if you don't, all keys are rebindable. It also has support for the 360 controller, but I perfer the mouse and keyboard. So many brats will stop playing this game because the controls aren't your stereotypical 3rd person shooter. I'm glad they aren't. Or this game wouldn't be nearly as fun. The game has great variety of enemies as well as weapons. The game also hits the dot on challenging without being too hard or too easy, atleast on the normal difficulty. Proffesional will give you one hell of a  fight though. This is also one of the few games that gets escort missions RIGHT.Replayability: Way more then you'd expect. New costumes, new unlockable weapons, a new difficulty level, 3 EXTRA MODES. Also, the game is just fun to play again IN GENERAL. Also features New-Game plus-ish features.Last thoughts: As a fan of the Resident Evil series, I can safely say this is my favorite. I have no problem with the Resident Evil series changing from Survival-Horror to Action-Horror and so many people♥♥♥♥♥♥on this and Resident evil 5 (Also a good game) for the sake of NOT being survival horror. That's rediculouse. Go play SIlent Hill or Amnesia for horror. This game is great mixture of action and certain horror elements (Those regenerators...*shudders*) and is a fantastic game. One of my favorites of all time.9.5/10			"

												Dont buy the game until a patch comes out. I am a HUGE resident eivl fan. But the game slows down alot. It is not my computers problem because i can run Re6 no problem on the normal video settings. But turning everything down to the lowest setting on Re4 still makes it very slow motion for me, do not get, until they fix.			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Resident Evil 4 HD 

			Views: 25,120		

			With the Steam release of Resident Evil 4 HD, we've decided to cover one of our favorite games of the past generation. Join Josh on this nostalgic look at one of the most influential games in recent...		

If a franchise sticks around long enough, it will inevitably be faced with the uphill battle of trying to evolve to meet the needs of an ever changing landscape. After the half step toward full 3D in Code Veronica, Capcom struggled to reinvent Resident Evil for a new console generation. An early effort was re-purposed and became the brilliant Devil May Cry but it would take many years for a new vision to take shape. When Resident Evil 4 finally hit store shelves for the Gamecube in 2005, it would forever change the face of survival horror video games.  Players once again filled the shoes of Leon Kennedy as he searches for the President's daughter, Ashley Graham, in a remote area of Spain. She is being held by a mysterious cult who are trying to utilize a mind controlling parasite called Las Plagas to gain power. The village that Leon first comes across is filled with infected townsfolk called Ganados who are hellbent on stopping Leon and completely loyal to Osmund Saddler, the leader of the Illuminados cult. Lurking behind the scenes is the familiar face of Ada Wong whose activities are a mystery. Resident Evil 4 continues the tradition of offering an eccentric and ridiculous narrative that successfully links some of the franchise's biggest characters to it's events but also stands well enough on it's own that newcomers are not left scratching their heads. The tank controls of past Resident Evil games are gone, the camera instead looks over Leon's shoulder in a fully 3D rendered environment. The camera's position obscures some of the action and creates some tense moments while allowing players to enjoy more fluid and natural controls. When aiming his gun or wielding a knife, Leon remains in a fixed position which may seem unnatural to action game aficionados but it does create some tense moments as groups of enemies converge on Leon's position. With this new control scheme gunplay is a much bigger focus than in past Resident Evil titles. Enemies come in greater volumes, ammo for basic weapons is more plentiful and there are a few set piece moments that require you to gun down scores of ganados lest they tear Leon's limbs from his body. When it comes to gameplay and combat, the Plagas present a satisfying new angle to the gameplay in Resident Evil. The Ganados function the same as the Zombies in prior titles but with added tenacity and dexterity. They throw axes and dynamite, climb ladders and leap across small chasms in pursuit of Leon. Additionally, relieving a hapless Ganado of his or her head may not be the end of a fight since the pesky Plagas are prone to evacuate their hosts and tackle Leon directly or cowardly emerge from the bloody stumps of their necks, flailing their tentacle like bodies like guillotine blades attached to a weed eater. Shield bearing cult members and blind mutants with massive claws that must be dispatched by killing the parasites on their backs also refresh the enemy roster and make the combat in Resident Evil 4 more satisfying. Several satisfying boss fights provide the cherry on top of the Resident Evil 4 gameplay experience.  The greater focus on action does mean that scares are less frequent then they were in previous entries. Wandering around a hedge maze with Plagas infested wolves waiting to jump out of bushes and seeking keys whilst being pursued by wheezing, seemingly unstoppable regenerators are some of Resident Evil 4's few terrifying highlights during it's three acts. While the first two acts are enjoyable and varied the end of the third act is a monotonous shooting gallery that culminates in one of the easiest final boss battles in the series. For a game with so many strong characters and boss scenarios the conclusion is a bit anti-climatic. This handful of minor grimace worthy moments is largely lost in amidst the rest of the experience which will take most players fifteen or more hours on their first playthrough.  As if the main campaign wasn't long enough, Assignment Ada reveals some of Ada's activities behind key moments in Resident Evil 4, fleshing out the narrative and offering some new weapons and mechanics to challenge Resident Evil fans. Mercenaries mode challenges players to survive and kill as many enemies as possible. It's an addictive mode that would go on to become a staple of the franchise by enticing players with a risk reward system, stringing together kills gives players a multiplier and breaking hourglasses extends the time of the session, providing a greater opportunity to post a high score. With these additional modes, it's really easy to get thirty hours of entertainment from Resident Evil 4. The muted, earth tone rich Spanish village that serves as Resident Evil 4's setting is a massive departure from the dark, claustrophobic and sinister mansion from the first game and the post apocalptic city scape of the second and third games. When it was first released, Resident Evil 4 was one of the most impressive graphical showcases of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube. With a 1080p resolution and some uprezed textures, Resident Evil 4 looks it's age but it is still capable of impressing. The atmosphere is as rich in 2016 as it was in 2005 but we do wish Capcom gave this game the respect to completely overhaul it in the same way that they did the fist Resident Evil game for the Gamecube. Rest assured however, this new HD port of Resident Evil 4 finally gives PC players an acceptable version of this classic to play.    Resident Evil 4 is a bittersweet experience, along with Half life 2, it helped foreshadow what was to come with new hardware as well as perfectly reinvigorating and updating a franchise that was in danger of loosing it's appeal as new hardware changed gamers expectations. In doing so however, Resident Evil 4 shifted the franchise's inertia toward action and with the next couple installments, Resident Evil would almost entirely forsake it's horror roots. With the death of Resident Evil as a horror game, much of the survival horror genre fell into mediocrity with Dead Space being one of the few titles to successfully straddle the line between action and horror before becoming a victim of the same fate. Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games of the new millennium. It maintained enough of the elements of it's predecessors to be identifiable as a Resident Evil game while otherwise reinventing the franchise. It's timeless gameplay, great art direction and mostly excellent bosses make it very playable almost a decade after it's original release. If you haven't played Resident Evil 4, now is as good a time as any.			"

												One of the greatest horror games ever made. Capcom should really learn from their past on what makes Resident Evil good. A blend of action AND horror. Not just action with a hint of horror. I mean this is survival HORROR isn't it?ProsAmazing gameplayGraphics look great in HDAudio sounds much better, and not bit crushed anymoreruns great on most PC'sConsAny and all problems in past releases have been fixed in this one.

												As someone who loved re4 finishing it multiple times both on ps2 and the old pc port, after only 10 minutes I was disapointed at how awkward the controls were. The mouse is extremely restricted and slow meaning you can only turn with W,A,S,D and when going into the aim mode there is a delayed mouse response meaning pulling off those quick knee shots is far more difficult. I just don't understand how it could be screwed up this bad when re5 had a great pc port. I recommend waiting for a patch, but if you must play it get a 360 controller. It's a shame because re4 is an extremely fun game that still holds up today			"

												After just completing the game moments ago tonight, I can safely say this is a great game I had a lot of fun with. To be honest, this is the first Resident Evil game I've played in the series, so my review is based on this game alone without knowledge about the others. In this game, you're an American agent known as Leon Kennedy who is sent to a rural village in Europe to rescue the President's daughter known as Ashley Graham from this sinister organization known as the Los Illuminados. Of course, it's not just a simple rescue mission, as it is soon found out it goes much more deeper than that. Without going into spoilers, the game revolves around trying to rescue Ashley and escaping safely, but at the same time, being drawn into and having to stop an organization with their plans that threatens the entire world.I've never played the original version of this game, so I can't speak on differences, how this is better or worse, etc. That said, I found this game to be pretty good and solid. Playing this game, I got the feel from it that it was made several years ago, in terms of graphics and gameplay. Despite that, I found the game to play good. The story and characters were the highlights of the game for me. With characters, I can praise the good design, believable dialogue/personality, and more. With graphics, I can admit that they weren't state of the art like some games released today, but then considering this is an HD remake of a game released several years ago, it's understandable. And even with that, I still thought the graphics to be good with that considered, as I was able to be taken into the game and it's world, story, characters, and more. So basically, while I found the graphics to be showing their age, I did still find them to be impressive. And honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the controls at first with character movement and camera, but as I played more of the game, I got more used to it and it became more comfortable with me. I also found the game to have an excellent variety of weapons, which you could also upgrade and have some customization with them. Overall, I give this game my two thumbs up and a recommendation from me to anyone. A great game that I enjoyed until the very end and wouldn't mind playing again sometime down the road.			"

												EDIT: I'm changing my rating, since Capcom took the time to fix the crappy aim the game had when you using a mouse and now I can finally properly play it with mouse + keyboard. Thanks Capcom.Game is great and I love it, but I have always wanted to play this with a mouse and keyboard PROPERLY, with controls similar or identical to resident evil 5's. This port's keyboard and mouse controls still suck and are a drag to play with, I DEFINITELY don't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a controller or, like me, planned to play it with a mouse and keyboard for the first time.

												I'll say this now. I LOVED Resident Evil 4 and it's my favorite in the series, and I was more excited than anyone I knew for the PC release, but it was nothing but a disappointment, to be honest. For a port of a 10 year old game, it's RIDICULOUSLY demanding. I can run games that look a lot better at 60fps, maxed out settings and never encounter any slowdowns, graphical glitches or anything. People will say ""durrr get a new toaster!"" or ""your pc just suck!"". Well, my PC is only $1000 and daddy and mummy wouldn't give me money for a more expensive gaming PC like yours. This port is POORLYoptimized and for a lot of people it's riddled with slowdowns, off-sync audio, flickering textures, flickering lighting, green flickering between cutscenes, blurry text, and many other problems.As it stands, the game has no subtitles, even though they appear greyed out and off in the options. The game has a misleading ""Return to Main Menu"". Most people can get rid of the slowdowns if you lock it to 30fps, but that defeats the purpose of getting the HD edition for PC eh? You'd have a better time getting it on your console. But with all the graphical glitches this makes this version unplayable for me. I'd be able to crack out my Wii version and have a better time with it, and it would look a heck of a lot better. No patches or anything so far, so I don't recommend this version.			"

												It's Resident Evil 4! It's still a good game that's as charming as ever and the graphics hold up surprisingly well. Don't go into this expecting modern controls or interface though. If you can get past how this game plays (and remember it was one of if not the first game to attempt this camera/control scheme) then you'll find a good version of a classic game here.Also don't go into this expecting good keyboard and mouse support. It's functional and playable but it's obviously emulating the same things a controller would do becuase this game was made entirely with a controller in mind. Still nice that it's an option though!

												What a fantastic game. Resident Evil is horror action game at its best. We play as special agent Leon Kennedy, our mission is to find president doughter and get her safley to home. All we know is that she was kidnapped by some sect. No more need to know if you didnt played it, story is simple but interesting. As i mentioned before its classified as horror game, its more like a 3rd person shooter placed in horror envierment, no jump scares, only bunch of ''zombies''. Tho there are moments of really high scary action, like when we fight Verdugo or our first contact with Regenerador. So if your interested in buying a horror game, there are many better picks. What i must say about the game, is atmosphere. Its best part of the game. Heavy, dark and bronze collored adventure. No horror movie got me to adventure like this game, i was simply sucked in. This edition of game features mouse control, for me it was good, it took about 1 hour to get used to it, but after this time you get really skilled in it. Game is long, about 16 hours for me, but there is still more for me to play, there are many other missions that take place in time of our actions. It lets you to look at the adventure from all perspectives. What can i say? Its 10/10 action game. Trust me, its AWESOME, i am not a fan of horror games, but this atmosphere and tension give you great expirience. Must play for all game fans, specially that it costs less than 5$, its a must have.

												Another Resident Evil HD remake, but I really enjoyed this one just like the others. The textures are nice and crisp, the gameplay is fantastic, and its just plain enjoyable. There is some extra content to enjoy. Really the only thing that made me cringe was the multitude of quickaction cutscenes. They're so random and lightning quick and the consequences are instant death. Never really understood this mechanic. Its a great addition to the collection for anyone who wants the classics in their library.			"

												After spending almost 48 hours on the PC version of Resident Evil 4 (with 100% completion & unlocking everything) I'll give my thoughts on this timeless classic.First off the keyboard & mouse controls in my opinion are perfect but the only issue I've had with this version is that you can't quit the game in fullscreen mode or else you'll have to restart your PC. (You have to exit the game in windowed mode for some dumb reason & 3 years later Capcom has not fixed this bug)Before DLC was ever a norm in videogames we used to have more gameplay in the extras menu like Mercenaries (Horde mode but with classic Resident Evil characters to play as like Wesker for example) & two Ada Wong story modes for example so I don't know why we don't get them anymore (DLC was a mistake) in games but I hope it makes a return in 2017 because I miss browsing through the extras menu to find bonus gameplay.In the Ada Wong missions most of the cutscenes are not in HD but everything else in the game has HD textures & I'm a bit disappointed Capcom implemented the Xbox 360 achievements for this game.60 FPS is very smooth for shooting Ganados but for some odd reason QTEs are more annoying (especially for climbing & pressing the XC keyboard button combo for example) compared to the other versions of Resident Evil 4.Now to a bit of the game itself since we're done the PC port segment of Resident Evil 4.Ashley is still annoying as hell 12 years later with her constant ♥♥♥♥♥ing & I don't know how Leon tolerates it because the island segment almost made my ears die a bit inside + I think in my personal opinion is the biggest flaw of this game is the fact the companion can't do anything useful at all besides cower at Ganados. (She does some useful things like driving the bulldozer for example but that's all the credit I'll give her)Exploration is still very strong in this game with the amount of treasure & guns you can collect, Boss battle design is still intense (Even on Pro mode too), inventory management is crucial for everything, puzzles are balanced (This is one of the few games where I'm fine with slider puzzles) & the merchant is still a mystery (I don't know if Capcom will ever reveal his identity at all) but there have been theories about him.

Here's a bit of trivia about this version of Resident Evil 4 apparently Ashley's breast physics were toned down. (To be honest I'm too busy shooting to care about this tiny feature but it does suck that Japan censored this game)

			Update: Sorry, we really should have shown this. For the neck plaga enemies, as the head is removed only very temporally and the plaga is monster-like in nature, it is the same in the West the first...		

My favourite weapons for the game itself are the Red 9, Blacktail, Striker, P.R.L. 412, Broken Butterfly, Killer7 (Same name as Suda51's game on the Gamecube), TMP, Rifle, Semi-auto Rifle, Knife (In Resident Evil 1-3 the knife is useless but in this game it's your best friend), Bowgun, Infinite Launcher & the Chicago Typewriter.Some hardcore fans of Resident Evil wouldn't like the infinite typewriter saves in Resident Evil 4 but I personally don't mind it at all & the story itself is good but nothing too special (I like fighting the Plagas parasite) but the gameplay has inspired other videogames after it's release 12 years ago. (I'm disappointed that there's not much backstory on Krauser himself in this game)Overall I highly recommend this game & I'm hoping Resident Evil 7 when it's released on January 24th will go back to it's survival horror roots because even though I started the series on the 5th game I've been very disappointed at how distant the story has become thanks to Capcom's greed.If you think I missed anything at all in my review feel free to comment.EDIT: Resident Evil 7 is a success to both Capcom & gamers http://nichegamer.com/2017/01/27/resident-evil-7-ships-2-5-million-series-tops-75-million/http://nichegamer.com/2017/02/10/resident-evil-7-ships-3-million-worldwide/ "

												This game killed the resident evil series. Know to be also one of the best survival horror game it was the end of the genre at the same time. What came after re4 where action horror shooters(re5,re6)  this game was the gap for future horribel resident evil games  they should have ended the series at 4 it would have been one of the greatest franchasis if they did not evovle into re5 re6. That being said re4 is one of the best resident evil game with just enough horror and action mixed in Leons adventure of saving the United State of America's president daughter from some cult kidnappers that have some sort of virus.  If you havent played any Resident Evil games I recommend starting with RE 1 since if u played re4 first its hard to play the old once.			"

												Its a great game.I was first introduced to this game when my dad played it on the PS2 in 2006. I remember ""Inheriting"" the game when he handed the ps2 down to me. I remember it freaking me out and couldnt play it in the dark, with the regeneraters making me put down the game for a few weeks because i was terrified of them.That was a long time ago, and it stood the test of time. Its a good port for what it is. Moving from controller to mouse and keyboard makes it a much more enjoyable experience. Graphically, its what you would expect from a 12 year old game. It got SOME graphic adjustments, but it still has the late ps2 era graphics. Its not an ugly game by any means, just not pretty either.Do I reccomend it? Yes.			"

												The combat and the atmosphere are very tense and well done. The quick-time events and the story are not. Regardless, this is a hell of a game that deserves its reputation.			"

												This is, hands down, one of the best and most replayable games ever made PERIOD.You can like it or not, obviously, but Resident Evil 4 has so much to offer it's quite hard not to have a nice time with it. This was the first game to feature the new Resident Evil layout of commands and at the time it was demonized for not being the classic survival horror as the old games were.I loved them, I really did, but it was time for a change of that clunky movement system(if you played the originals you remember it took a hour just to turn around with your feet planted onto the ground, I still miss the fixed camera though).That being said the game is/has:- REALLY good- decently long- nice and well balanced- different environments- cool bosses and events- a HUGE replay value- more modes to play it even more!- tons of other stuff- tons of mods if you STILL feel like playing itThere's also a couple of bad things like:- the graphic is starting to show its age even though I'm accostumed to it- the porting. It's good but for some reason on quite a lot of GPU's it starts to slow down REALLY HARD when there's a couple more enemies on scene than there should beConsider that I'm running this on a GTX 750 2GB but I've had friends experience the issue on more powerful GPU's. You can either lock the game at 30fps or 60fps(nothing in between or above that) so setting it to 30 ""fixes"" it.I also still reccomend playing it in 30fps because that's how the games was supposed to be played when it came out and the 60fps glitch some stuff(doors and more) and even though we all love the 60fps this is not a complete overhaul of the game but just a re-texture so playing it ""as it was"" is the best option imho.That being said if you're still thinking about getting RE4 well, I love the serie but it's still a classic for those who don't too! Wait for the sale if you're not 100% sold on this but trust me, this will give you a great time and will prepare you for RE5 which you can co-op with a friend too :)P.s. oh and to be clear don't mind my played hours here. I played it on the GameCube during the original release and finished it more than 10 times, then I played it and beat it at a friend's house a couple times, then I finished it on an ""non original"" version waiting for the sale on Steam and only THEN I got it and finished it once here.Now I have a couple more games that are keeping me busy but I plan to finish it over and over again here, it's just THAT good ;)			"

												This is one of the best, if not the best, Resident Evil games out there. The game is nearly 10 years old and it's still as moody and creepy as when it was first released. However, if you've played the Gamecube version you'll notice this PC version lacks a bit of dynamic lighting that was present in the original game. It makes the game a tiny bit less creepy, but just a tiny bit. The PC version makes up for it with 60fps gameplay and mouse support. The mouse support is pretty awful however, so I connected my controller within minutes. Playing with a controller still takes a bit of getting used to, but it's so much better than playing with a mouse and keyboard. Except for the aiming, of course.You aim with the red laser on your pistol and because your character and gun sway it can be difficult to make precise shots. Ammo is limited, so you have to be careful with it and make sure that every shot counts. Even if that is pretty much impossible. Treasures can also be found on the islands and they can be sold to a salesman that sells upgrades and weapons. He does not sell ammo, though. And that's a good thing, because it would've made it an action game instead of a survival horror game. I thought it was all perfectly balanced; I almost always had enough ammo to kill enemies and never too much (ok, there might have been a bit more ammo near the final boss).RE4 is also responsible for the revolutionary over-the-shoulder camera view, which puts you right behind the character and with it adds that special layer of tension and immersion to the game. Brilliant stuff.Also, I'm glad I finally managed to finish the game, because I never was able to finish it on the Gamecube. Your quest is long and will take you a minimum of 16 hours to complete. After that you can play the extra missions that were present in the PS2 version. The game never got boring (unlike RE6) or too scary. Like I said before, it is perfectly balanced.The graphics still hold up, even if a lot of textures are blurry. There's still an amazing amount of detail to be found in the environments and characters, and let me remind you that this is an old game. I'm not talking about the upgraded textures here. I'm impressed the Gamecube was even capable of displaying this back then. The fact that the PC version now has the ability to show the game at 60fps makes it even better. Controls feel more responsive (QTEs are the exception here) and the gameplay is an even smoother experience. The sounds are still awesome and add to the creepy atmosphere of the game. Even the voice acting still holds up, but note that there are still a few corny lines here and there. Nothing that detracts from the experience if you ask me.RE4 is an excellent game that still holds up to this day, and if you never had the chance to play it before, now is the time. There's no excuse to not play it so off you go.[Rating: 92/100]			"

												Great game, compared to my old ps2 copy, the pc version is much better, although the wonky controls still exist, you can get used to it very fast. One thing to note is that if your pc can't run at a constant 60 fps then you will experience slow downs which feels like slow mo, since the game was coded so that actions follow fps, slower fps means slower action. And the game only runs smooth at 30 or 60 fps.If you like the resident evil franchise then you should definitely pick this up as it pioneered the 3rd person view in re4.			"

												Game itself is a wonderful game but the actual way the game plays is horrible compared to its non HD original formats. Lots of probs so far from first impression play from the following so far: Mouse aiming sucks and sensitivity don't help any and in fact makes it far worse, control movements are way off & slow, video cutscenes audio and video don't follow the characters at all despite the game running flawlessly on my computer not syncing correctly. In conclusion, while the games graphics compared to the original PS2 & PC versions have been amazingly been improved and very well done the game itself is just not worth buying unless they plan on making some drastic fixes to make it playable and balanced like its original counterparts. However, if your a fan of the series and especially of Resident Evil 4 and its magnicent impression on the series its worth putting the extra dollar into to add to your collection and if not I do not reccomend buying it and sticking to the original formats on your fave consoles for the best Resident Evil 4 experience especially if your new to the game itself. Buy this one at your own risk of your allowance.			"

												This version on PC seems to work with the Controller Flawlessly.  Join Leon on his real bad day of rescuing the daughter of the president of the united states, to save the world!  All the side missions from different versions are included making the experience complete.  Played the game through with a knife and grenades, spent hours trying to melee or grenade salizar but it wasnt happening.  This game is real fun, so you can challenge yourself as much as you want.    This is pretty much the old PC release with new shinier graphics and some tweaks.  No gamebreaking bugs encountered during the playthrough, this reboot is done by Q-Loc not capcom, gotta wonder if capcom even makes games anyore.  Cant move when you shoot, the AI in this game is great, they even blow themselves up.  The Ada missions under the ""Extras"" on the menu are alot of fun.Rating:  10/10  Value:  $24.99			"

												Don't cross me pls since this is my first time actually finishing Resident Evil 4 fully. I absolutely loved Nemesis and played through the second game. So I know some♥♥♥♥♥♥about these games.I've played this game couple of times, but only some scenes, when I have visited a friend etc...I've always praised this game, beacuse I just know how good it is, a masterpiece in other wordsIt took my 16 hours to complete it on Normal mode and now I am going to second run on Proffessional mode. Really satisfying and engaging story. Leon is sent to rescue President's daughter...seems easy enough well♥♥♥♥♥♥It ain't man... Great voice acting, especially Leon and the villains throughout the game. Merchant is probably the most cool character ever known to gaming community. Feels like an actual Survival-Horror game. You have to conserve ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of ammo, herbs and grenades for mini-bosses and actual bosses. At some point you might find bunch of TMP ammo and then suddenly you find loads of Rifle ammo. So you'll have to choose wisely what weapons you have to use. Difficult and enjoyable puzzles. Now I am that type of guy who hates puzzles in games. I admit that I didn't have that fun solving them. But eventually when you would finish a puzzle you realize how simple it actually was. Especially that puzzle when you play as Ashley and you have to move those stone plates. IT TOOK ME SLIGHTLY OVER 1 HOUR TO FINISH IT. Boss fights are tough and I love it. Once you realize the weak spot of a boss, it's quite simple to kill it. Still requires a bunch of strategy to take bosses down. Killing a boss hasn't been ever this satisfying as in this game. It feels like an actual achievement.I wish nowadays games were like this, as in terms of opening extra content. No stupid paywalls etc... Complete the game on normal to get mini-stories on other characters, epic unique weapons, a mercenary mode, costumes and proffessional mode.This is probably the most important things about it, without making it too long. This game is a masterpiece, no wonder people say it's the game of the century. I cannot wait to get my PS4 Slim so I can get it on there aswell. A MUST BUY "

Third Person Shooter Survival Horror Game


YouTube™ Video: Resident Evil 4 HD || Third Person Shooter Survival Horror Game || Let's Play Part 1

+ The gameplay itself is great, especially if you are looking for a zombie-like horror survival game to really get your heart pounding. You will mostly be alone traveling around while being hunted by tons of creatures in very horror-esque settings.+ Very atmospheric sounds and music which really helped to create suspenseful moments all throughout the game+ The story was good although not special. You play as Leon a US agent sent to Spain to recover the kidnapped President's Daughter Ashley from a group known as the Los Iluminados. This group has been essentially infecting people with mind-controlling parasites, and also experimenting on humans to create abominations. + Boss battles are absolutely fantastic. Every boss is a unique encounter that involves facing some truly large and terrifying creatures. Each one is entirely different, and include some thrilling fights.+ Controls (while also being a negative explained below) makes the game extremely challenging, but at the same time very rewarding. I started the game despising the control scheme as you are unable to move while aiming, and aiming in itself can be very difficult. Although, as I pushed through the game, I started to actually appreciate what the developers were going for as the restricting controls make every encounter dangerous. Even regular enemies can be devestating if they catch you off guard, which really brings out the horror element of the game.+ Great variety of enemies. You will be constantly fighting new creatures throughout the game which keeps the game feeling fresh the entire way through, especially considered every enemy is a threat which you have to learn to take out efficiently.+ A nice selection of weapons to unlock and upgrade. Each weapon tends to have a specific use as well which will have you constantly switch between them during most battles. (Example, Shotgun is great at close range as it has high knockback and dmg, Pistol is good at medium range, Rifle at longrange, etc.)+ Loot & Exploration is absolutely amazing in Resident Evil 4. I was CONSTANTLY looking all over the place for treasure, ammo, and money which can all be traded into the shop to buy wepaons, upgrades, and supplies. It is so rewarding, and almost mandatory to explore as the game's difficulty really requires you to upgrade as much as possible. + I may have mentioned this above, but this game is DIFFICULT. It is not a walk in the park, even on easy you will likely die a number of times as a new player to the series. To me, this is a great thing as a sense of challenge always makes the experience far more rewarding.+ Many mini-games, puzzles,  and side events to break up the mindless shooting. + Lots of content. About 12-15hours+ in length (including 3 bonus missions after you beat the game)  - Pacing is a bit slow at some points throughout the game as it consistantly has you go through maze-like labyrinths which involve a fair bit of back tracking.  (At some points I was just like ""Aghhh I just want to get out of here!)- The story objectives get a bit skewed about half-way through the game.  At one point you are supposed to be waiting for a rescue helicopter for Ashley (The Presidents Daughter)...but end up getting side tracked and going into a dangerous Castle to fight some ultimately unimportant enemies.- The controls are entirely different from any other shooter. They can be very difficult to learn, and often frustrating to new players as simply aiming can be extremely challenging. This is heightened by the fact that there's no way to change the control scheme or to change the movement sensitivity of your controller.- You can't move your character while aiming or reloading, and there is no dodge or roll mechanic. This is a bit annoying to me, as you tend to fight in very small rooms or corridors making it very easy to get hit or damaged.~ Just a personal nitpick, but they should have let you buy ammo from the shop. Part of the game consists of being low on ammo and using it wisely, so they decided not to make ammo widely available....			"

												Are you serious, Capcom/Steam? First of all, I love this game and I cannot reccomend it enough but this PORT is TERRIBLE. First off my computer can handle a lot, so the issue is with the game, not the hardware. When I first started the game, it chugged slower than a snail in molasses. I thought that this was perhaps a first time startup thing. I got to the main menu where the curser itself lagged out and it could barely move. I first went to the options and for good measure I set all the graphics to the lowest settings and all the prettiness to ""off"" to try and improve performance. It barely changed anything, even after restarting the game it churned slowly. I thought maybe just maybe the real game wouldnt be so bad... but to my suprise it was worse. The cutscene was super slow, and when i skipped the cutscene (out of neccessity in order to move past the seemingly frozen frames) I got to the first screen of the game with half the textures missing. It was all black! and Leon moved of his own accord in a small circle shooting at the ground. I checked that my controller was not plugged in and on the floor or something, and that nothing was on my computer keyboard. It seemed as if everything was going wrong. But please, dont take my word for it, just look here at this screenshot and decide for yourselves weather or not to support another badly hashed port of a great game. 


What is even happening? You made a bad port, Steam. A very bad port.

												I don't recommend you buy this. Terrible PC port with god-awful controls. Leon handles about as gracefully as an overloaded rubbish truck with the tyres let out, the mouse speed is so slow that the whole thing plays like one of those underwater dreams (even at maximum sensitivity), sometimes it dislikes it when you try to turn, and casues Leon to end up facing 90-180 degrees away from where you intended (especially in the midst of combat), and half the quick time events are broken. Also, you can't sidestep. Presumably, forcing you to run around a corner and right into that zombie/dynamite trap makes it that much scarier, but I would have to say it's just poor design.Oh, and fairly mediocre plot and character development. So the game is kinda boring, and more than a little frustrating.			"

												This game has not aged well, and the game has not been ported well to the PC platform.  Keyboard and mouse controls are still awful, and gamepad controls are loose and unresponsive even using a program like x360ce to fool the game into thinking you're using an official Xbox gamepad. The textures have mostly just been scaled up to fit the new native widescreen resolutions without actually being improved very much, and the ""locked at 60fps"" and ""locked at 120fps"" options cause a lot of issues in cutscenes, where the sound plays much faster than the video, to the point that the sound will often be five or six seconds ahead of the video.  Additionally, the pre-rendered cutscenes have not been changed since the original 2007 PC port, making the difference between in-game and cutscene very jarring.While this is better than the 2007 PC port, it's still a terrible version of the game and you are still better off buying or renting a used game console if you really want to play RE4 again.

												Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Goldeneye, Halo; What do these games have in common? They’re all revolutionary video games that have altered the way we play and perceive games and gameplay. Resident Evil 4 certainly belongs in that list for many, many reasons.It takes much from a company to invent the wheel twice. The Resident Evil series is known for having codified and popularised the survival horror genre in games. This game though, Resident Evil 4 laid the foundation for modern survival horror games, third person shooters, and other action games that we see and play today. Before Resident Evil 4, third person shooters were a mixed bag. The camera was a mess, or it gave you a terrible view of the action. Resident Evil 4 fixed all that with a streamlined over-the-shoulder-cam, aiming mechanics and challenging gunplay. Stiff controls were remedied with the ability to dodge on reflex button presses, now known as the much maligned quick time events. Finally, whatever we classify as cinematic gameplay these days was perfectly proportioned and executed in Capcom’s 2004 behemoth masterpiece.Many of the aforementioned innovations are mainstay today, but back then they were earth shattering. It is a testament to wholesome game design. Not only are the mechanics polished to a shine, they complement and substitute each other. QTE-s don’t overstay their welcome and they have weight and purpose to them. The camera keeps you, the player, in the game and as a result inside the character; forcing you be careful and actually giving you a reason to prevent grave bodily harm. And bodily harm is ever so present. You’re Leon Kennedy, one of the few survivors from the Raccoon City outbreak and now in the employment of the secret service. Tasked to retrieve the president’s daughter from a desolate rural region in Spain. What you uncover goes beyond the horrors of zombies and corporate scheming. Resident Evil 4 uproots the series established formula and takes survival horror to survival terror. The sheer viscerality of the presentation makes for a non-stop freight. Horrifying villagers drone at you in the dark while their heads make place for disgusting parasitic flails that take precarious aim to keep at bay. The horrifying rumble of a chainsaw soon makes place for the utterly blood curdling terror that are the late game enemies that approach the limits of how much a person’s senses can process while trying to get the girl home safely. The music is frighteningly effective at enforcing the sense of unease. The mild bliss of the piano that plays in save rooms is the only respite. Especially considering the sound design on some of the enemies. Just the breathing of some of these freaks just makes you want to turn your PC off and sit in a corner; crying in abject terror, afraid of the nightmare that you will have when you go to bed later that day. What’s more? What else can a game so amazing offer more? Imagine a season’s pass worth of extra material. Except that you don’t have to pay extra for it. Two extra chapters, a cruelly addictive minigame, new game+ and a whole plethora of costumes and weapons are all included in the single price. It is hard to get such a deal these days, and it shows how far publishers have fallen in terms of packing their releases with content. Ironically, Capcom is one of today’s greatest offenders.Still, the game has aged. The controls are stiff, the textures are muddy at times and the occasional slow-motion might present itself when the lighting engine has to bend in ways it wasn’t designed to. However, do not forget, that Resident Evil 4 is a full package. Everything is balanced in and on itself, creating a wholesome and undeniably enjoyable game that can keep you entertained even ten years after it first saw the light of day on the Gamecube. Resident Evil 4 must be played. Passing up on it is an insult to videogame history and an insult to yourself. You’d be a fool for passing up on a near divine piece of gameplay that is equally hellish in atmosphere.			"

												Capcom must patch this game. I tried to play this game but Leon ends up shooting all over the place and theres nothing i could do. I tried to aim at the enemy but Leon aims behind him instead of the enemy right in front of him. I love RE4 back when it came out for Nintendo Gamecube but this is too much, i can't get past the first chapter without it being stupid.. The game also goes slow motion and the lip syncing is really bad when its in slow motion and i know i'm not the only one experiencing this problem. I want to recommend this game but as of right now i'd say dont buy it unless a patch is released fixing these problems. :/			"

												A masterpiece in general, Residnt Evil 4 has everything anyone could ever want from a survival horror game. The game basically puts you in the shoes of government agent Leon S. Kennedy who is sent out on a mission to retrieve the president's missing daughter, but stumbles on something more dangerous than what he originally thought. For $19.99, you get a lot out of this game. You get an amazing story that is well worth your time, additional modes to play with after you beat the game, a great combat system with unpredictable enemies, and some fairly challenging boss battles that should keep you busy for a while. In general, Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 is one of the best video games I have ever played in my life, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes horror. The Verdict: 10/10 Definetly one of my favorite games of all time. One of a kind, and cannot be redone.			"

A classic that still holds up Very unique from the first installment. Instead of a mansion you have Spanish village/countryside, a castle, and an island. Instead of rationing a handful of items you can carry almost everything (after playing a bit of inventory tetris). Key items don't take up inventory space, finally. There's about ten times the number of zombies--and they all gotta die. They're so eager to get shot in the head the game started engaging full-on Call of duty mode towards the end.A ton of effort was put into develping unique, memorable bosses. Both the fights themseleves and the personalities stand in stark contrast to what little I remember from the first game's characters and lines (other than Jill Sandwich). Tank controls were a huge turnoff but the enemies are sluggish enough for the player to work around it. Every time a cool cutscene came up I mashed f12 to capture it, only for an annoying QTE to appear. Luckily QTEs never caught on with other games in the 90-00s.  Oh wait			"

												Stands the test of time as one of the greatest and most tense action games ever created. Tons of replay value and depth. Pros of PC port:1. Tons of Mod support2. Extra visual features and upgrades compared to others including color filtersCons:1. RE 4 does not favor keyboard and mouse, as quicktime events use the left and right mouse button, and the x and c keys. Also mouse sensitivity needs to be on max to feel remotely in control. 2.Any and all menus can be affected with the mouse which is innaccurate and ruins the flow of the game.3. Only 2 standard settings for FPS, fixed 60 and fixed 30. Just makes me wish there was a happy medium between the 2 like 40-45 fps.4. The absolute inflated PC requirements. Particle effects in particular such as blood, water, and dust will indefinitely hamper your performance at the higher framerate. This is a 10 year old game, there is no reason only beefy rigs should run this game. The visuals don't even suggest that this game suggest a higher pc requirement. Despite these cons, the gameplay is still fantastic. That in couple with mod support definitely make the pc a good purchase either if you've played resident evil 4 before, or never got around to it.

Although this is only a remastered version of the game it's still definitely worth it with the PC's spectacular visual overhaul but still keeping the game feeling like it was your first time playing. I'd give it 9 out of 10, definitely worth 20 dollars.			"

												Basically if you haven't played Resident Evil series before, game may seem a bit clumsy. Well that's obvious. It has been released 7 years before and people in nowadays rather spend money on new battlefield DLC than on old singleplayer shooter. However I enjoyed every second of it. It's combination of FPS, strategy (more or less), and the best thing ... Zombies. Cool missions, secrets, bosses and main character is Leonardo di Caprio. What could be better? So would I recomment it to you?There are many kind of people and I'm quite sure 50% of them won't understand meaning of it so better watch some gameplay videos if your really decided to buy it.I find this game addicting and it's my 3rd favourite game after Metro 2033 & Last Light.8/10. Sentence - Ashley, how about nice cup of shut the hell up!			"

												“what are you buying?... what are you selling?.. is that all stranger?, he he he…. is that all stranger?, he he he… is that all stranger?… is that all stranger?… is that all stranger?… is that all stranger?… heh he he, thank you.”Ah… I never thought I’d hear those words again from our friend the Merchant. Coming back from an eight year Resident Evil hiatus and playing this game again was a refreshing treat. I will also say that I enjoyed it on the PC much more than PS2 or even Game Cube. I really liked the direction Resident Evil 4 shifted towards… and not just because I liked Ashley Graham’s jugs. I’ll admit that it was a big adjustment getting used to RE4 at first. When the game was first released back in 2005, I was whining and crapping out bricks when I got my pre-order copy on Game Cube and played it for the first time. I was upset because it didn’t have any zombies, and I didn’t think that the old men with rakes and pitchforks at the beginning were very menacing foes. But playing further into the game and encountering some of the tougher enemies and intimidating bosses along with the really captivating level designs… this game turned out to be a real gem and became my favorite of the RE series. I even liked it more than Code Veronica X where I was obsessed with Claire Redfield’s jugs… and then before that where I fantasized over Jill Valentine’s awesome jugs… a rack worthy of resting my joystick on / or I should say in between. Sorry, I got lost in the moment thinking about all those gorgeous jugs and giving Jill Valentine a pearl necklace with extra Big Mac sauce… anyway back to my review. I have not Played RE 5 or RE 6, but if they are half as good as RE 4; then they will be well worth playing. I’m really down for playing RE 6; that Helena Harper is one fine piece of♥♥♥♥♥and she has got a phenomenal pair of jugs – and Juggerdan likes his jugs. Seriously though… Resident Evil 4 has got my seal of approval at 10/10. Get this game if you haven’t played it, or missed it to play the newer ones… It’s a classic. Oh and just in case I forgot to mention, that Ashley Graham has got a fine pair of jugs! :)  "

												Lots to say about this masterpiece. First of all Resident Evil 4 is personally ranked as my #2 favorite game of all time. It is also my favorite Last Gen game. I have beaten the game more than 10 times due to its high replayibility and unlocks. I have played the game on gamecube when it first came out around 2004ish, then on my Wii, xbox 360 HD edition, and finally the Ultimate HD PC Edition. I am here to say without a doubt that the PC port is the best version of them all for many reasons. The HD remake is absolutely gorgeous and feels very smooth with its 60FPS option. For a game that has been out for a decade now it still makes some current gen games look older. Not only are the graphics good, but the gameplay is what makes this game such a gem. Its original third person over the shoulder combat style aiming revolutionized the third person gaming world today. This is the kind of game that gets better the more you progress, making replaying on higher difficulties worth it for its rewards. You play as Leon S. Kennedy who is a familiar Resident Evil Character first seen in Resident Evil 2. A ton of other characters make small cameos that I do not want to spoil. You are tasked with finding and rescuing the President's daughter, Ashley Graham, from a group of cult like crazies called Los Illuminados. Without giving away too much, the game follows that story pretty well. Aside from Story Mode, the player can then play a mode called the Mercenaries and other game modes that open up a new character's storyline. All in all there is TONS of stuff to do in Resident Evil 4 and with only 25ish hours in I still have stuff to do in this game. Like I said earlier, I have played this game numerous times and still to this day I enjoy every bit of it. Fantastic masterpiece of a game - 10/10 Masterful			"

												""Whaddaya buyin?Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger.""I will keep it short since basicly everything about this game was already told countless times.I did enjoy playing it a lot. In fact played entired game with my fiance and damn it was a blast how much she enjoyed it.""Because of Ashley and climate, and enemies, las plagas and so on"" those are her words not mine, and believe me she's not really a gamer or a person who like to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up in videogames. And yet we beat it together for the reason above and i do totaly agree with it. Climat is great, atmosphere is really cool especially in the early stages when you are dropped into the village with absolutely no idea what to expect. Graphic... well design is amazing both protagonist and antagonist (sometimes it gets bit confusing who is which of them which is cool too). Desing of enemies along with all sounds and voices does a marvelous job for the game BUT keep in mind that this is and older game and it's just a PC port from PlayStation 2 WHICH was already a port from GameCube soo... You get the idea right ? Overall visuals appeal to gamers but they are far from amazing, and to add you even more graphic WAS of this game could be amazing about... 2 years prior to it's release. Anyway screw it, it does the job fair enough if you will remember that it's old. As I said before Sounds and voices are pure gold, all sounds just like it suppose to and that's most important. Music ? There is none. Gameplay wise - it's realy fun and enjoyable BUT not from the start. At start IT SUCKS. And you know why it sucks ? Because it's the worst kind of port loop. What i mean by that ? Everyone who played probably already know. If there is a thing that will get you mad and ♥♥♥♥♥ing about everything IT'S CONTROLS. You see the most important thing in enjoyable PLAYTHROUGH IS BEING ABLE TO PLAY THROUGH. But give it a shot. I know that game should hook you just from the start, and RE4 tries, it reall tries as hard as it can especially with atmosphere but also unfortunately slaps you straight into you dirty face and punch in the balls. Playing the first hour will get you used to it though and later only from time to time you will ♥♥♥♥♥ about it. All and all i'm telling you guys - if for some reason you did not play it yet, do it. Try to play it in small doses tho since it may become a bit repetetive at times and bit boring at the end. But those are just minor complains that doesn't really affect overall game play experience. There is now also lot of bonus content, like mercenaries mode, sorta like a minor campaigns and literally TONS of content in here. Buy it, have fun and try to forgive that it's rather clumsy port of another port. It's definitely recommended and the BEST resident evil game to date in my opionion and plenty of other players and the game that you should try despite the fact of being or not Resident Evil fan. Definitely amazing, especially the 1st half of the game.Have a good day guys !FrankCastle51 out.			"

												This game holds up perfectly after all these years.  Still one of the most tense and atmospheric video games I've played — and, I would like to point out, largely because of the controls.  Many will whine, ""artificial difficulty!"" but to me they're just as they were in 2005: deliberately clunky yet stylized, oddly stiff and elegant at the same time.  It feels like there's an art to managing headshots and kicks on a crowd of swarming not-zombies, and when you have to move there's a sense of urgency and spatial consideration.  In total, it feels like something halfway between Doom and King's Field, and is quite likely the best Biohazard/RE to date.  The port here is just fine, too, though I've encountered a few fleeting issues with slowdown and stuttering.  Nothing that has kept me from thoroughly enjoying this old favorite.  Oh: the music is really something, as well.  (01/22/15 edit: There are some issues with QTEs tied to the framerate, sometimes leading to issues where QTEs are either too easy or too punishing.  QTEs were the worst part of the game to begin with, aside from a slight decline in the quality of the environments around 2/3 into the game, but they're even worse/weirder here and it does mar an otherwise solid port — albeit one I would still recommend.  Just be forewarned.)			"

												Resident Evil 4: Oh man, where do I begin with this?If you have ever owned pretty much ANY console in existance past the Gamecube, you may have played RE4! It is an instant classic of a game, and while some fans do hate on it for ""ruining"" the series, I disagree.Not only does the game reward you for your hard time and effort, it is extremely replayable! I am not exactly sure why this is, as the map is really linear at some points, but it is a challenge! If you like challenges, this is your game!Imagine if Dark Souls and RE had a child, this would be it. It is difficult, I won't lie, especially in the games hardest difficulty (Professional), but it will reward you for completing the game with weapons, and cool costumes, and you get to keep your stuff after you complete the game for another playthrough. Plus you have another two mini-campaigns and a Mercenaries mode, which you can play as various characters from the Resident Evil franchise (5 stars with all characters on all stages for a sweet surprise!). The cons of the game would have to be the rage-inducing moments it produces, even though that in itself isn't much of a con for me, but maybe it would be for you. Also, the graphics are a bit dated, although this is an HD version of the game, so the graphics aren't exactly too bad... Lastly, the game can get repetitive at times, which may discourage some of you who are expecting a everchanging adventure, but if you can get past the repetitiveness of the game, you will have a great time!Overall, I highly recommend it for RE fans, and those who are seeking a not-so-scary, but not-so-easygoing game. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and I hope this will help you to decide on your purchase of this extraordinary game!			"

												Being my first game in the Resident Evil series, I had different expectations after trying the RE7 playable demo. I was pleasantly suprised, however, to find a third person shooter unlike any I have played before, and is without a doubt the best I've ever played. What the game lacks in graphical fidelity, it makes up for im ambiance, mood and immersion. The world, despite having relatively dated textures, has a dark theme that perfectly fits the desired effect the game as a whole produces, with its intense music, risky combat, and overall ""survival"" tone. RE4 is one of the few horror games where I actually found myself planning my upgrade path and managing my supplies and weapons. Each weapon is very unique, and provides a different feel to combat situations. The combat is clunky, but purposely done so in a way to make you think about your shots. The controls are a little wonky on pc, as it is very clear this game was intended to be played with a controller, so I definitely reccomend using one if you can. Quick time events seem to be a problem on M/K, as more than a few occasions I found myself restarting a QTE over and over again because even though I was spamming ""X"", it wasn't really registering. Boss fights are extremely varied, and none of them felt like a chore although I wish they were a little more challenging. Ammo management is pretty easy to manage for the first two thirds of the game, but becomes a problem later in the game which can turn some players away, but I never found myself completely out of ammo.  Overall Resident Evil 4 was an extremely enjoyable experience, with an incredibly atmospheric setting to back up solid shooting gameplay. Pros: +INCREDIBLY well deisgned world and atmosphere, especially in the first area.+Excelent progression system designed to make you think.+Exhilarating combat, forcing you to pick and choose your shots.+Survival aspects work very well, forcing you to carefully manage your inventory, health and ammo.+Interesting story, although I haven't played enough of the other games to really appreciate the plot.+Decently long, I beat it in about 16 hours of gameplay. You will not want to play anything else until you complete this game, it is very addicting.Cons: -Messy mouse and keyboard controls, was obviously designed for a controller-Dated textures (not bad textures, the game certainly has a classic charm but the relatively poor graphics may turn some people off)Overall Score: 10/10 Must buy, the best 3rd person shooter I've ever played.

												I bought this game cause it supports mouse (beside HD quality). It does support but somehow I was more comfortable playing with keyboard only. Mouse only helps you to aim and move camera around you. You still need  A and D buttons to turn. And it's confusing for a while. Even highest sensitivity feels slow. I had terrible headache because of controls.Knifing boxes is probably most used action in this game. However everytime you hold your knife it takes about a second before u can move it. I mean everytime. Thus, knifing enemy on the ground is not preferable at all. You may even want to skip some boxes.I hope they at least fix this knife issue soon.edit: I recently tried Logitech F710 controller, same result...update: knife issue is fixed with recent update. Assuming they will fix remaiming problems soon, I recommend this game.			"

												Let me just say at the top of this review that I think Resident Evil 4 is a fantastic game. My playtime at the time of the writing of this review indicates that I haven't played this game all that much, but I should point out that I have beaten the game twice before in a different version of the game. Highly recommended, I say. No, this is more of a review of the port rather than the game, and perhaps you may want to consider looking at a version of the game that isn't this one.Capcom clearly didn't put forth a ton of effort into the PC port of the HD version of Resident Evil 4, originally released last year for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. One could be forgiven for thinking that the delay was likely for the purposes of optimization    and the inclusion of standard PC options, but Capcom will occasionally pull an Ubisoft and delay PC ports for aribtrary reasons, just for them to end up performing suboptimally (see also: the kerfuffle going on about the upcoming Dead Rising 3 port).They did at least put in a handful of the standard PC options, so it's not entirely bad news. The list of options includes fairly standard anti-aliasing settings, anisotropic filtering, and turning off the godawful motion blur. Allegedly you can turn off v-sync in a config file that I have yet to locate on my computer (for some reason it doesn't exist in the location that I've heard it's supposed to be, so either that's just a problem on my end, or I'm working with outdated information), and sweet, sweet 60 FPS (unfortunately capped at that or 30, but acceptable for a port of a 9-year-old game). What they get wrong, however, are a couple of key factors that keep me from recommending this version of the game. The aformentioned 60 FPS option is quite the boon, but it does run into some issues that are largely attributed to dodgy optimization. The game speed tends to slow down as the framerate chugs, which can be very distracting. I wasn't experiencing too much of this after turning down a few settings, but your mileage may vary, as is the nature of PC gaming.That first issue I could probably deal with, but it gets worse. Usually I don't tend to expect a field-of-view slider in a third-person game, but dear God this game in particular needs one. The over-the-shoulder camera angle in games like this or Gears of War I feel lends itself to the problems of a low FOV in a first-person game a lot more than in games like Max Payne or Grand Theft Auto, where the camera is farther away from the player character. It's arguable that such games should possibly include one anyway for accessibility's sake, however I do understand why Capcom might not have considered it since most people likely played this game originally on a TV at a farther distance than one would be playing the game from a desk. There does technically exist an FOV mod, but as of this writing it doesn't work on the current version of the game. Even that I could get past by taking a break every half-hour or so. It's not ideal, but not a deal-breaker either. However this game commits what I consider to be a cardinal sin for a PC port of a shooter. This game has built-in mouse acceleration. Highly noticeable and affecting mouse acceleration. And there's no way to turn it off. No fix currently exists. This makes aiming in this game far more difficult than it has any reason to be. A lack of consistancy in the mouse sensitivity makes the case that the Wii version is BY FAR the most well-controlled version of the game. Comparing it to PC...that just shouldn't be the case. This issue alone I think makes it difficult to recommend this version of the game. I just don't see myself being able to put up with this nonsense throughout the entire game, and I'd imagine others would feel the same way.There are a couple other issues the port has, such as some very noticeable audio de-sync going on in some of the cutscenes. I think I heard that this might be less of an issue depending on how well your machine runs the game, but I think it still bears mentioning, as the delay can get to be embarassingly large. One cutscene in particular had AT LEAST a full second of delay where the visuals were behind the audio. Still, issues such as this one are pretty much nitpicks compared to the awful mouse acceleration.If this game gets a fix in the future, even if it's just through mods, I may revise this review and possibly give it a recommendation simply because the game itself is just that damn good. As it stands, I just can't recommend this right now. If you see this game on sale in the future and are tempted to buy it, I'd check pcgamingwiki.com or the Steam forums to see if the major issues have been resolved. If so, go for it. Otherwise, just pass, even if the price is attractive to you. If you're looking for another version of the game to play, I'd personally recommend the Wii version due to the controls actually working pretty well if you're willing to put up with a bit of waggle during the QTEs (to those who argue that the more precise aiming ""throws off the balance"" and makes the game worse, all I have to say is we'll have to agree to disagree on that debate). Otherwise, pick up any of the other console versions that exist as I'm sure they're all just fine and dandy.Just don't pick up the original PC version. Just...don't do it.			"

												Not exactly the hottest port or update, with the main difference being not so great new textures and a couple UI fixes for higher resolutions. Despite the base game being over 10 years old, there are some areas where frames dip even on a gtx 1080 @1080p There is also a complete lack of audio options. In spite of those shortcomings, it still runs well most of the time. KBM support works well enough with 2 options for mouse aiming, they both take getting used to, but either one should grant more precise aiming than the old gamepad once you've become accustomed. Despite the silly humor and cliche moments, it always finds a way to put you back into tense situations where only fast feet and sharp shots will save you.  And for the most part, that feeling of tension stay with you the whole game.  There's nary a dull moment with our hair-parting hero in the game's 12-16 hour long campaign.  In addition to the main campaign, there's also 2 smaller campaigns featuring RE2/4's Ada Wong and a Mercenaries mode that is basically a survival mode where you can choose your character and each character has their own loadout for you to experiment with. Overall, its a great game that has a LOT of replay value with it's main campaign and the Mercenaries mode.Looking toward the future, hopefully if they decide to do yet another port/remaster, (which they probably will knowing how many times they've already ported it, and during this age of remasters and reboots,) they'll do a complete overhaul and do it on the RE Engine that they used for RE7, not just a coat of paint with a couple more pixels on the textures and call it ""ultimate.""

												Keep in mind that this game is the first Resident Evil game I've played.  Ever.I can't speak for how different this game is from the past instalments.  However, this game is fantastic and I find that it's succesfully managed to get me hooked on the entire franchise; I'm a picky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to the games I like/craft the badges for nowadays, but I just had to do it for this game.  It's fun, satisfying and well worth the money I payed for it.The story is summed up like this; Leon S. Kennedy is sent to a rural Spanish village, where it is most likely the President's kidnapped daughter will be.  As you can expect, things go wrong very quickly and Leon is forced to fight his way to the President's daughter and fight his way out.  Not completely original but still not executed poorly; whatever story was there was enjoyable to follow and I feel like it increased how much I liked the game.Anybody who is accustomed to modern third-person shooter controls will find these ones stiff at first; you can't run and shoot, you can't run and reload, you basically can't run while on the offensive.  That being said, this feature makes Leon feel more helpless, making the atmosphere and the environment of the village-gone-wrong even more effective.  Going up against a mob of people and being forced to run away so you can regain your composure and reload is something that is key to the game and I actually think it's a good idea it's there.A problem that I faced, however, was a good amount of framerate issues.  At first these really weren't that prominent; however, when you get later in the game this just seems to get far worse than before.  Since I was already hooked on the game I didn't quit after this, nor did I find it to be a gamebreaking issue, but it still really affected how immersed I was with it.  I'm not sure that this will be fixed entirely; this is a Capcom game and to be truthful they aren't exactly amazing with their fan service (GFWL not being removed from most of their games, apparently ruining this franchise with Resident Evil 6 and Raccoon City, DLC that's completed and on the disc yet still charging customers extra for it, managing to bury my favourite Mega Man spin-off franchise).  That being said however, it isn't a MAJOR MAJOR issue and you could easily look past it with how much you're getting.To sum it up, I had and am still having a lot of fun.  Pretty much at the last parts of the game at this point and I hope that the ending will be a satisfying touch to an already great game.  I think Capcom really did justice to this instalment.			"

												Resident Evil 4 is widly considered as the best survival horror video game of all time, which is true the game get's a lot of things right in gameplay, design, and presentation.  The story is good too, as it does fit well to the resident evil formula and takes the series into a bold new direction.  6 years has passed since the devestation accord in Raccoon City.  Taking place at Europe in the rural part of Spain, U.S. Government Agent Leon Scott Kennedy is tasked to search for the President missing daughter that has been kindnapped.  Upon his arrival Leon finds out that the village isn't all what it should be as he attacked by not zombies, but by Ganados which are humans infected by the parasite know as Las Plagas.  Leon soon get's injected by the sperm of Las Plagas and only have a matter of time to complete his mission before he'll end up being one of them.Resident Evil 4 retains the series novelty, but also streamlining the frustration that has plagued the series for awhile.  It does away it's complex puzzle, fixed camera angles in favor to a more action-oriented approach, it has the best camera I've seen in RE4 and it does a great job keeping up the frame of the action and showing it's dark, gloomy visuals the game is build upon back in 2005 when it was originally released.  You know what, I should say this anyway:  Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition is a solid port to a great game, it's better then the 360/PS3 version in all aspects since the settings is superb in everyway, there are a huge framerate problems in some areas, but the sence of scale and fun action is enough to enjoy this already excellent game.  Don't expect much out of this version, because this is the same PS2 version you got back in 2005 since it has all the content it needs.  Capcom needs to step up the re-release of these games and give us more of it or stop doing it entirely. (They won't stop doing it thou...)  The questionable performance is a curious one since it requires a good computer, but no matter how good your PC is, you will run into framerate issues in this ""Cough"" Ultimate HD Edition.  Still, I recommended for those who wants to experience this legendary horror game for the first time or your playing this because your a fan of the series.  Rest assure, Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition is a solid port and worth the value it's asking.			"

  Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4  This is the fourth and remastered edition of the games in the series. In a game we play as a well known to us police officer from Raccoon City, Leon S. Kennedy, which is currently a secret agent of the US government. Our ancestor is sent on a secret mission to Europe to find the president's missing daughter. The clues bring our hero to a small town in Spain where we realize that this is not the usual town. When if was not enough for the people the game offer the main campaing but also additional campaigns ""Seperate Ways"" where you play as Ada Wong, where as the agent of the Umbrella Corporation her task is to get a sample of the virus. Mercenary mode, where as different characters in the game we have to survive on the map and collect points. Personally, in my opinion it is the best game in the series I have ever played. The game has a great sound system, charismatic characters, very good gameplay where you have to constantly think and conserve ammo, great atmosphere and interesting story. The biggest downside of this production is controls, for me personally I do not mind but many people may hate. Apparently the game has support for the mouse and keyboard, but definitely a game more comfortably on the gamepad. This does not change the fact that it is much better than the original. However, before buying I advise you to think about that. "

												The controls take a little getting used to (M+KB anyway) and some of the later areas are a little weaker, but this 11 year old game still holds up amazingly well. Lower res textures aside, it looks very good in most places. The gameplay variety is also fantastic. Given how it still plays today, it's easy to see why it blew everyones minds in 2005. 9/10. Highly recommended! (Note: I played it entirely on a Win 10 laptop and had no slowdown or glitches whatsoever. It only crashed once for me in nearly 19 hours when trying to load a save, which didn't repeat)			"

												If you have not played Resident evil, you can never find a better place to start than this.Resident evil 4 is still a great game 10 years later with it's incredibly satisfying gunplay, great atmosphere, replayability, etc.However when one of the greats first made it to pc, the result was abysmal.Now only was it a straight port from the ps2 version(the graphically inferior one), it had no mouse support and the keys were clunky.However 9 years later, Capcom Re-did the port with not only updated visuals and mouse support, but also made it run at 60 fps which feels great.If capcom keeps fixing up older ports like Onimusha 3 and Devil may cry 3, they could have themselves a winner.If you already played Re4 a bajillion times, you may or may not want to pick it up.But if you wanted the re4 pc port you had in your dreams, this is worth it.If you haven't played re4 at all, absolutely get this.8/10 not only a great game, but a significant upgrade from the original 2005 pc port.

												If you've never played Resident Evil 4, this is the best one of the series. This is because it drops all the awful Resident Evil story garbage on the porch and just gives you Spanish zombies and Spanish Napoleon with a giant robot, something that might show up in a Crazy Dave Tape video. It's a great mix of horror and action, rather than just being dumb horror or all action, all the time. It's bonkers the same way an old third-degree VHS slasher is bonkers. Don't play any of the other games in the series, they all suck like a Hoover with a wig and googly eyes on the end at a thoroughly sinful Sears.If you still have Resident Evil 4, have your old console with the game, have it on PC somewhere and don't care about Xbox 360 controller compatibility: You're paying $20 for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HD textures, don't bother.

												so many years, so many consoles and versions, so freakin many playthroughs i cannot even count anymore... one of the best games ever made, and even more noteworthy considering the state of video games when this was released. there were other games that seemed to do some things better, but this was and continues to be a real jewel. notice i don't misuse the phrase 'diamond in the rough', as so many numbskulls do these past several years, but symantics is a whole other subject. team fortress 2, for example, was a diamond in the rough 5 or 6 years ago, and it has since evolved to an online masterpiece. a diamond in its rough state, in other words, not a diamond among lesser things. but i digress...worth 20 bucks, though it can be had much cheaper if you have the knowledge about how to shop. buy it for 2 or 20, but buy it. i don't care as much about the remaster, as i am (ironically) using a 1024x768 monitor for the first time in a decade, but this version has everything and then some that has ever been included in a release of RE4. i do think the textures are better than before as well, despite my low res rendering, and it all does help some with immersion. honestly though, this game has a unique and brilliantly executed atmosphere that permeates the game world even when blurry textures were more of a standard thing in this game. i use and have always used a controller for this game. i guess use kb/m if that's your thing, but controllers are just the better way to connect to the world in most games, and this one is no exception. controls are as good as ever, and using xbox one controller is even another small step up, but that has nothing to do with the game directly... get this game if you dont have it, or if you want to revisit it, or if you want to prove that you are the one person in the world who isnt going to like it. nothing much needs to be said, and ive been rambling since i started this unnecessary review. everyone knows it's a marvelous game, now you can be sure i know it too.

												The best version of Resident Evil 4 to date, runs at 60 FPS, supports resolutions up to 1920x1080p(or higher if you downscale/upscale),has somewhat better looking and higher detailed textures,uses some of the cool Gamecube shading and lighting effects which were so far only available on the Gamecube version of the game(duh),has  all of the nice extra content that came with the PS2 version such as Ada's separate ways campaign and it has pretty damn good M&K controlls.I don't think i have to say much about the game it self, it's Resident Evil 4, you probably allready heared about it,saw gameplay of it and maybe even played it in the past few years unless you've been living under a rock .This game came out pretty much on every possible console, even the PC has two versions now, the first version that was bad and this new one which is very good.Bottom line, very good version (best so far imo)  and the game is still a ton of fun even today and better than most games  we get today.

												I've heard a lot of mixed reviews on this one. Personally, I found it to be quite entertaining. Out of the more modern Resident Evil games, this is the best. The story isn't all that amazing, but the gameplay is very fun. Controls are nice and tight, and visually looks great. My only gripe is the quick events, this is the RE title that started them. At times they're completely fine, and other times they're just really frustrating. For example, in the middle of a dialogue movie you'll need to press two buttons or just die on the spot... sometimes my hand isn't even on the keyboard as I'm watching the video... and I have to take a death and do it over. Another time I was finishing a ~5 minute event and it was followed by not one, but two events that I failed consecutively to my death. Lazy design on those in my opinion.Other than that, if you're a fan of Resident Evil... check this one out.Got this for $10 during the Halloween sale, and is WELL worth it.			"

												Speaking of Resident Evil 4, I want to just yell at each corner - a masterpiece, a revolution in gaming, etc. I note a few words about the game itself. What you need to know to modern gamers:- A game which is ahead of its time, even now, the game is played just fine;- For the first time people start the game will be a surprise in the form of Challenge;- A huge variety of gaming moments;- An interesting story.And much more. It makes no sense to talk a lot as it is necessary to look for another gamer who has not played this game.About remaster - it is excellent. Here is excellent, reworked control, which finally did sane on the PC. Level graphics - GC (that the praise remaster) with some twists such as filters, shadows and mastareys 60 fps .... and it's all a matter of fact. And it's wonderful. This is all the exact same game we all love, in the best version, and I recommend it to all, an unequivocal masterpiece for the ages.			"

												Although this game is a great one, and very well loved, I can't play it on here. It's not my PC, as I can play games like Skyrim on the highest settings and it runs fine. That said, whenever I play this game, cut-scenes run fine, all menus work as they should, and all animations are smooth overall; however, the gameplay itself is playing in slow-mo... I don't know if this is due to being a port, or what, but, what I can say is that I can't recommend getting this game on PC. You're much better off getting another version of it, on its original release system, if you want to play it... I've re-installed and uninstalled multiple times, and as I said, can play high-end, more modern games on high graphics settings. I can't figure out why this game doesn't run at a decent pace. Oh, and none of the dialogue is matching up with the cutscenes, either (they speak before the mouths move).			"

												Yes, it looks dated, yes, the controls are a bit clunky, but yes, it's still a classic. Resident Evil 4 is still a tense, unsettling game. Ammunition is scarce and the 'zombies' are plentiful, sporting dungarees and looking like refugees from the 'Deliverance' movie. Maybe this is what happened to Dexy's Midnight Runners since they split up. The lack of guns and bullets make you ponder your next move, and wishing you could collect more pairs of underpants, rather than whistling as you work your way through the hordes with an AK-47. You can pick off a batch of them from a distance with a sniper rifle, only to turn a corner and find a gang of them high-tailing after you. And they aren't even zombies, they are disgruntled nutcases, another unwanted gift from the ever-shady 'Umbrella' corporation. These unpleasant chaps and erm 'ladies' shout at you in a sort of unintelligable lingo. They love their pitchforks, axes, dynamite sticks, and huge boulders which they roll down hills at you. Fortunately they are less than proficient at throwing dynamite, often blowing themselves up if you stand on higher ground. But watch out for the array of booby traps scattered about. Trip-wire and bear-traps are popular. And if you run out of bullets, you had better perfect your knife slicing technique or these raving loons might just make sandwiches out of you. Resident Evil 4 sent the survival horror genre off in a whole new direction when it was released about a thousand years ago, and it would have been nice to see the game reimagined for next-gen, but the difference between the HD version and the original does seem only cosmetic. The game deserves more than just the lick of paint it gets here, but it's still as gripping an experience as it ever was. 9/10 (As scored in 1861, when I had a Gamecube)			"

												FIRST let me just say this game is AMAZING, a true classic that has aged like fine wine. Got that? Okay cool.The one thing....the one damn thing that ruins and prevents me from wanting to play this on Steam is that it comes with a crippiling glitch for your computer. For some reason after playing in full screen and exiting the game from the main menu the computer goes completely blank, no return to desktop, no close....just ends. I had to restart my computer recovering from a system crash because of the game failing to shut down properly. You also cannot use the Windows button to go to your desktop or use CTRL + ALT + Delete to end the software from playing.The game its self runs perfectly fine though, a nice smooth frame rate with tight controls HD to boot. Ashley's Panties out of 10. #""YouPervert""My advice? Stick to the console versions if you don't want to risk running in to this annoying glitch, it won't crash on you, although I can safely say this glitch does not happen to everybody, I run a dual screen set up so that might have something to do with it? The game is still very much playable.....it is just you can never leave. "

												This version of RE4 is a port of the xbox 360 version, which was meant to be a 'HD remaster', the port functions and is serviceable. There are two fans giving this version a complete HD overhaul, even 3D modelling in areas that need it, and they're doing a great job of it, but Capcom should be ashamed of themselves for this, I'll explain why.Two people are capable of doing what Capcom couldn't. You mean to tell me Capcom couldn't put in the effort that these guys are putting in? Did they not have two people to spare, is manpower really that scarce over there?Nah, we all know why they didn't bother giving it a proper HD treatment, and that's why I can't recommend this game.

												Played it on GameCube. Played it on Wii. Played it on PC.This game changed Resident Evil and even if you don't like the new ones, this is just amazing.Like in other games the basic gameplay stays the same but the environment and enemies vary in a nice and exciting way.Dependent on the difficulty you choose, the game achievs the true meaning of survival horror.You don't♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants but you may run like ""oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!"".Sometimes your companion can be annoying but most of the time he/she moves smarter than companions in other games.The checkpoints are kindly placed, so you can try to start the game on normal mode, even if you don't feel brave enough.There isn't a huge selection of weapons but later in the game you can choose between different pistols and rifles, which is a perfect amount for me. All in all this game is pure fun. There are no gamebreaking bugs (I didn't experienced any bugs at all) and the gameplay is fluent (no long loading screens, boring things et cetera).I recommend to play this game with a controller.

												This is one of my all time favorite games. While it may not be the best PC port of a game, if you do get it running then get ready for an amazingly horrifying journey. This game lets you play as Leon S. Kennedy, You travel to a small village in Europe to look for the presidents daughter. Along the way you'll be able to play through some of the most terrifying locations ever created. You will use an assortment of weapons from pistols, to shotguns, to SMG's, to even an RPG. The gameplay is the best its ever been in any of the games. So all around, while I do still prefer the Wii version of this game, the PC port is still good......when it works...........PC Port:8/10Wii:10/10PS2/PS3/PS4/Gamecube/Xbox360/Xbox1:9/10			"

												One of the greatest horror games of all time. If you consider yourself a fan of the third person shooter genre, the horror genre, or video games in general, you are doing yourself an immense disservice by not playing this game. The PC controls are a little odd at first, but once you get the hang of it they feel great. Tons of replayability. Runs great, and the graphics have held up pretty well for a game of it's age.			"

												As we come closer to a decade since Resident Evil 4 was first released for the Gamecube, Capcom decided to tie up some loose ends, remaking the PC version.Since this is a re-issue and not a brand new game, I think it's better for this review to focus on the improvements and flaws this ""Ultimate HD version"" offers, rather than talking about the game itself. 9 years after its release, I think we all know Resident Evil 4 was a great game, that marked a new direction to the series, aiming towards the Action genre instead of the Survival Horror themed games we were used to back in the day.Comparing this game to the original Ubisoft version is pretty much of an insult... to the Steam version. The Ubisoft version was an awful port that is hard to believe it could come into existence (at least as the status it had when released). Thankfully, there are some good hearted people who tried to fix most of the catastrophic blunders that version had so they could turn it into an actual enjoyable game while we waited for this new version.The Steam version comes on and I'm glad to see many of the problems being solved; starting with being able to recognize which key/button to use either with the keyboard or controller, rather than patching the game. Forget about getting crushed by boulders just because you have to guess with key/button is supposed to be ""3"" and ""5"".The lighting and shadows look way better than the patch Ubisoft released for their dreadful version. The fact that you can actually destroy torches, affecting the lighting of the ambience, is a good highlight.The quality of the textures are good overall, although I'm a little bit disappointed since some of the textures in the fan made ""Albert Texture Patch 2.0"" for the original version looked way better.The cutscenes are probably the best improvement in this version; while in the other platforms and versions you could recognize many differences between cutscenes and gameplay, in this one there's no such differences.The 60 FPS mode was the hardest thing to get used to. The first times I played the game I felt the sensation that it was going too fast, but I ended up used to it.There are, however, some problems I found in this version.-In first place, some enemies go crazy. Some Ganados and Garradores use to spin in the same position for no apparent reason.-As far as I remember, there's still a poor quality cutscene in the game, specifically one of the first ones in the Separate Ways campaign. In fact, it looks worse than the Ubisoft version ones, and that's saying a lot.EDIT: I'm reading some reviews here on Steam from people complaining about the whole Separate Ways campaign to have mediocre cutscenes. So, that makes things even worse.-Sometimes, the game drops to a barely playable framerate. It happens mostly when throwing a flashbang to the first plaga that emerges from the head of a Ganado, or during the final battle against Saddler. My PC meets the requirements to play this game with no such problems, but they keep happening.-What's up with gravity in this game? When you shoot say, a spinel, from a cave or a wall, it falls at a ludicrously high speed.-The amount of achievements in this game are poor. And most of them are so easy to get. Achievements are supposed to be an extra challenge to the player. They could have put, for example, one for destroying a certain amount of torches, or by getting a specific score in The Mercenaries.Overall, this version is worth the money. It takes one of the greatest games of the last decade and puts it into the quality that PC Gamers deserved on the first place!			"

												This is a wonderfully creepy game, with fantastic pacing and a decent enough storyline to keep things interesting. On startup I disliked the controls and camera angle, but as you play you realize the game is very specifcally designed around the controls and the speed of the game suits the actions. The game also supports multiple playstyles--you can succeed as a bull-in-a-china-shop player, or as a more patient player. The game does contain some surprises and shocks, but I didn't encounter any overly cheap tricks. The best part of the game is how terrifying it can get--I jumped and screamed numerous times, and if you really get into it (sound up, lights low) I think you'll find this a good RPG/shooter with fantastic atmosphere.

Posted: July 11, 2014
												I'm going to discuss the quality in this purchase in two ways: in the first paragraph I'll talk about how it is as a port, and on the second I'll talk about how the gameplay stands up.In case you don't want to read the full review, I'll just come out: It's a bad port to a good gameSo why is this a bad port? Well first of all, the automatic framerate is set to 60 fps. Now I run a good computer (flawlessly playing skyrim with 70 mods good) but when I played it with that setting the whole game slowed down. I felt like I was watching a slow-mo replay that never stopped. There really is no excuse for that from a ten year old game. I changed it from 60 to 30 fps, and it worked perfectly for me. HOWEVER, I noticed on the reviews some complained about headaches from the jumpiness of the framerate, which they say must have been below 30. Honestly, I didn't notice. I felt fine. So, if you're sensative to that kind of thing, be wary. But like I said, I didn't feel a change. The aiming also can get a bit janky, but honestly, the fact I can use the mouse made up for that. The other thing is that the controls can be REALLY weird. They were already weird on the gamecube, but hell: if you want to rotate an item in your inventory you have to use the ""delete"" button. And they never tell you. And you can't change it. (I'd be angry at Capcom for this impossible to guess choice of button, if it wasn't for the fact I was legitimately concerned with Capcom's mental well being. xD) Then there is the promise of HD textures. HD?! More like Hardly Different! AM I RIGHT, FOLKS?! But no, seriously, there is nothing HD about it. (That being said the standard graphics really aren't bad, so eh.)So does this game hold up today? YES. Is it fun? YES. Does the poor quality of the port get in the way of fun too much? NO. Really, if this port is the only one you can get your hands on, you should get this (unless, of course, the headache issue above may be a problem for you). I was told that some of the later Resident Evil games (that I didn't play) became repetative and boring. Resident Evil 4 doesn't, and it does this a few ways: There is a constant difficulty, you always have to worry about a zombie flanking you, or just about the sheer force of the enemy; the enemies are often varried, not excessively, but enough that things are spiced up, and the level design is just really good. There is a section where you're in a castle for a long time, so the game designers are like, ""You know what be cool... A room full of lava... And there are dragon flame thrower things... Bro... That'd be so cool."" and then they did. And it was. (to be fair, this probably should have broken my immersion. It didn't. But it should have.If a survival horror game has a lava-dragon room, you know repetitive environments are NOT an issue. xDThe shooting itself is a bit weird, only allowing you to move or shoot, not both. I feel like this is actually a really good choice, it makes it so where you position yourself is more important (Tactics!) and it means you have a steady enough aim to get proper headshots (Gore! Sometimes!). Ammo conservation is also a big deal if you're not careful, it can get really tense when you realize you don't have many shotgun rounds to fall back on.The dialogue is literally the cheesiest thing I've ever heard, but it's one of those ""so bad it's good"" situations, and the story itself is... Okay, I suppose. You're certainly not going to be playing it for the story, anyway. You'll be playing for the gameplay. DID I MENTION THE GAMEPLAY IS GOOD? YES? AT LEAST FIVE TIMES? GOOD. LET ME TELL YOU A FEW MORE. This is a good game, it's just good. I had fun. It was a fun time.			"

												After ten years since its original release, Resident Evil 4 still looks and plays great. Superb pacing and lots of extra content makes it an easy recommendation for those who want to scratch that Capcom action itch. It should also be noted that no piror knowledge to past Resident Evil games is necessary.			"

												I'm glad Capcom decided to re-master this PC port of RE4, this new version is so very well done - from the textures, characters as well the gameplay settings. I really enjoyed playing this new RE4 remastered, it also gave me a big nostalgic feels as the first game that made me follow the entire Resident Evil/Biohazard series.			"

												I own this game on GameCube. I beat it four times, back to back. I love this game. It is, by far, my favorite, non-Zelda-game, of all time. This version; for Steam, I anticipated and even pre-ordered; something I swore I would never do again, after being burned on Aliens Colonial Marines. I pre-loaded this game as soon as I was able, and the moment it was released I played it....or, at least I tried to. The game runs in super slow mo whenever there are lighting effects visible. Leon’s run is at half what his walking speed should be. I tried everything to make the game run smoother. I set it to its lowest setting. Went so far as to run it in a tiny window with no anti-aliasing. Didn’t help. I run BioShock Infinite and Tomb Raider on Ultra with hardly any slow down, even in action intense sections. So, I know I don't have a problem with my hardware. What is the deal Capcom? Patch this nonsense NOW....pretty please. I want, so badly, to play this game again and relive all those magical days of calling in sick for work because I forgot to go to bed the night before -up all night playing. Fix this slowdown issue and I will forgive you and update my review to sing your praises.			"

												If you are reading this review because you are unsure if Resident Evil 4 is a good game, AND you are the owner of a monster spec PC, then stop reading, buy the game and enjoy it because it is amazing. However, if you are concerned about the PC port, keep reading.At the time of writing this review, only the actual PC port was tested. Firstly, it is MUCH better then the original RE4 port however it is not perfect. There are a few options which are pointless because they cripple your view. Motion blur makes you feel like you are drunk and the post-processing adds a black and white film-grainy filter to it. It is 3 different colours and it makes the game look worse. Also on my AMD R7 250, I could not run the game in 60FPS on 1080p however it ran fine on 720p with the occassional drop. Yes this could be because my card is not amazing but what I am saying is that maybe it could be optimised to run at 60FPS better on lower end systems. Not everyone owns a monster-spec PC though Capcom! The game has 2 frame rate settings, 60 and 30. If your computer cannot handle 60 then the frame rate will drop to 30 and because the FPS is connected to the speed, it will half the speed. The default settings reset button seems to be accurate enough though when it comes to optimising the game for you, which is a first!Finally, the mouse controls work fine however you cannot use the mouse in the inventory. Not a big deal but its fine. The game is still RE4 alright though and it is clear that it was taken seriously that the game was going to be ported. Keep in mind that you probably will need a high-end GPU in order to play 1080p/60FPS. Overall, Capcom has done a good job but there is still room for future performance patches to improve performance on lower end cards like my R7 250. However, I can report that overclocking my R7 250 ,which more-or-less increases the quality of the card so it is equal to the 7750, makes it run fine with AA off. Final verdict, the port is great.

												To those who have never played this game:short version: It good. Very.long version:I have never played any of the Resident Evil series before, but I remembered hearing that this one game was the epitome of survival horror for its time, so I finally decided to get it (over a decade later, ikr). (It was also a favorite on G4's X-Play! Anyone else remember them? Anyone? Ok...) I read that some people were not satisfied with the control scheme, but here's my opinion: IGNORE THEM. This is an awesome game! The inventory management, treasure-hunting, upgrade system (gotta love the Merchant), and combat makes this game extremely addicting. Also, there is plenty of FREE in-game DLC you can unlock, just the way it should be!Some cons: when I started, the default motion blur made me sick, so I recommend turning it off. I made some other change but cannot remember it now. (Just tweak the settings until you like what you see.) And some people do not like that you cannot move while aiming to shoot, and they do not like the tank-like controls. However, I got accustomed to it using my 360 gamepad, and you can too. If you just can't let go of your CoD or Halo control schemes and will cry if you have to, then maybe this isn't for you. But get over it. It's really worth it. Also, quick-time events are occasional gameplay, but it gets predictable and easy to work with. Oh, and one boss fight seemed too unfair, but whatever.If you've never played this, buy it. I'm glad I did. It's an experience you will not forget. Be warned though. You will become addicted...Merchant: ""WHAT ARE YA BUYIN'?""			"

												Very enjoyable game. It's a bit different than the first few resident evil games but that isn't a bad thing. It's a great game and if you played it on gamecube like I did then you won't regret buying it, playing it is a very nostalgic experience. It looks and plays smooth in 60fps and I've played through the game multiple times without any gamebreaking bugs. IMO it's definitely worth the money. Hopefully there will be an RE 2 remaster available soon..... also you should pick up resident evil remastered and RE 0 remastered if they're on sale because those games are also definitely worth the money.

 So I have beaten the main story line/seperate ways/assignment ada. . UPDATE ON FPS DROP IN POSSIBLE BUGS. |||||||  If your 60FPS mode starts going into slow-mo. Press M for the map screen, wait 2 seconds then it should be back to smooth. Instead of alt-tabbing out. Haven't crashed like this.||||||||||||||||||||Having only played the gamecube version of this game with at least 75+ hours clocked in when I was younger, I expect a lot. I expect a lot especially as the first port, that I actually have, ended up as garbage. lolI saw that this game is being updated with its bug fixes/add ons which makes it feel promising so I decided to buy it. I loved RE4 too much not to give this a try. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\First off, having played RE5/RE6 where the controllers are smoother on pc, I feel spoiled. I won't take away/bad talk  RE4 due to the fact that they are trying to keep this game as close as possible to the original which I can appreciate(or at least I Think they are). You can't move/strafe while aiming, you have to aim to reload,  the movement feels old (it came out in 05 lol) Stuff like that is something I will just get used to.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ POSITIVES \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Fortunately, you can change the key binds. I already hated using ""E"" as a action button. I switched that to ""F"".The 60 FPS and graphics looks sexy as ♥♥♥♥.After a good 20 minutes, the controls felt smooth, they feel almost exactly how I played on the gamecube. The ""modern"" aiming style is phenomenal. The only thing that scared me was the first QTE from the boulder run, made me smash X with XC to dodge. UPDATE: Just started 2-2 and I cannot complain. So far I am loving this game! The controllers feel great after you get used to them and aiming does not feel restricted! The team could not have done a better job. UPDATE: The team really out-did itself by listening to the community and fixing the bugs! They remade the game enjoyable and I love them for it. NEGATIVES \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\A negative I found is using the inventory. Maybe I haven't figured it out yet but using the inventory is a pain already lol. I don't want to have to move my hand from my mouse just to move stuff around. Yes, call me lazy but thats just me.   You have to deal with Ashley again lolThe audio-desync started happening near the ending scenes. I'm sure they will fix this tho as they have fixed more than half the game already. Seperate Ways movie clips look like complete♥♥♥♥♥lolPOSSIBLE BUGS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\After I save, the frame rate dropped to 30 but since the settings are on ""60"", the game speed was just cut in half. All I did was alt-tab and it would be start working normal again. This was from the first save typewriter, the ones after that were normal without bugging out.I have been having a lot more FPS drops/""slomo""bug. My game will become really slow/drop to 30fps but all I have to do is alt-tab out and alt-tab back in.It seems that the FPS drop/""slow mo"" keeps getting worse and worse. It happens often anytime I switch the screens like say I go to the merchant or just simply press tab. Of course all I do is alt-tab back in but that crashed my game once so now I'm scared. This is something that should be looked into and fixed ASAP.My pc specs are AMD Phenom x4 965 OC'ed to 3.8ghz8gb DDR3 Kingstong HyperX ram at 1333mhzMSI Twin Frozr III GTX 560 TI 448 core			"

												I was actually shocked to see this announced. With a terrible and hopeless port of RE4 being released years ago, I thought this'd never become a reality. I squealed like a weeaboo teenage girl when I saw the pre-orders in the steam updates popup.Upon release my heart was broken, as was the game itself. The aiming went all over the place and made the act of playing the game stressful as all hell, and I'd realised that I'd given all my hopes up for something that was probably asking too much in the first place. There would be no perfect edition of Resident Evil 4. Such is life, such is the way of porting games from nearly ten years ago...But then, to my surprise, they came out with a patch not a week later. A new aiming mode? All the aiming issues are fixed in both modes, you say? I was so genuinely surprised that in one simple patch they managed to fix every single issue I encountered. Pure ecstasy, and all my friends who were put off in the beginning were once again interested. But then I started encountering new issues with the game, for instance 'struggle' QTEs were hard as balls to pull off like I could in the console versions. Suddenly, here come the beta patches. Pretty much any issue I encounter gets targeted and I'm very grateful for that.Honestly, I'm sat here still letting it sink in that one of my favourite games got a successful makeover for current operating systems. The game looks and feels fantastic at high resolutions and framerates, although I had to turn motion blur off because it's not the best kind of blur. Only thing I could say is that I'm disappointed that it doesn't have the crosshair aiming system from the PC version of Resident Evil 5, especially since that functionality was in the Wii edition, but you can easily look past that and in the end it's still easily the best version of RE4 on the market today. Thank you Capcom! This is easily the happiest I've been with a release in a long time. And I hope you continue to support this game and hopefully allow some form of modding community access to the game, just to keep breathing life into it.			"

												What can I say about this game that most people don't already know?  It was the first over the shoulder attempt in the Resident Evil series and without a doubt the best of the three.  RE5 had the co-op to hold it together, and RE6 was just a joke.  RE4 pushes the limits from time to time, but Leon still feels vulnerable enough to leave a sense of survival behind -- unlike RE5 and 6.  Both difficulties, if played in order, give the player an extremely well balanced game.  Get your knife ready, because you are going to need it!The game-play in RE4 is awesome; however, if the player is stepping back from RE5 or 6, then the character will feel a bit clunky at first.  The enemies are also a bit more responsive than in RE5, which keeps the player on his/her toes.  There is a good variety of enemies for each section of the game, and the progression as well as the pacing is spot on.  This game also has better exploration than its follow-ups. Some parts actually require the player to back track in order to acquire certain weapons if he/she does not want to buy them from the merchant.The idea of a giant escort mission can sometimes turn people away, but this game creates the perfect setting for such a task, and it also paces the escorting so that it does not become repetitive or annoying.  The escorting brings a feeling of co-op from time to time which helps keep the game interesting.The inventory system in this game is hands down the most enjoyable of all the RE titles.  Leon is given  an upgradable backpack that the player can organize to the way he/she sees fit.  The weapons are also upgradable and numerous -- for an RE title.Over all, this game is well paced, action packed and well designed -- occasionally a little cliche or cheesy.  The PC version doesn't offer much beyond a sharper resolution and better controls for those that prefer a mouse and keyboard, but the game is still worth $20 in my eyes.

												Resident Evil 4: Ultimate HD Edition,a scare from the past or a ruined childhood?--ABOUT--Resident Evil 4 was originally released on the GameCube back in 2005,and claimed high critics and overall top scores.You play as Leon Kennedy, and your mission is to rescue Ashley Graham,the president's daugther. She's been kidnapped and brought to a villagesomewhere in Spain. And Leon soon realizes not everything is normal inthis village.This Re-release of Resident Evil 4 has been given the name Ultimate HD Edition,and features revamped textures, all of the bonus contents previously releasedon other platforms and improved PC controlls.--RREVIEW--First off I will start by saying that Resident Evil 4 was one of my favorite gamesduring my childhood. I loved the hell out of that game. UnfortunatelyI sold my old GameCube system many years ago, so when I sawthey were going to release it on Steam, I was genuinely happy,I could finally play it again, and it was the Ultimate edition.We need to understand that we're talking about a 8-9 year old game,and think back to when this game was released, this gamebroke bounderies for graphics and gameplay back then,and there's actually a limit to what they really can do withthis re-release. This is not Resident Evil 4 with Crysis graphics,it's the same good old engine as the original.The textures has been improved slightly, but there are HDmods out there that gives you even better textures.The gameplay is same as the original, clumsy-tank controlswhich adds the feeling of claustrophobia and panic when thezombies (Los Ganados) surrounds you.In 2014, we're used to tight responsive controls for the PC,so many will not like these old'days tank controls.Tank controls means there's a design aspect where youcan't look or turn around using your mouse. To turn aroundand change your walking direction you need to use yourA and D keys. For many this will bring frustration and agony,for others it's perfect game design which improves uponthe scare of the game.This is still to-date (based on personal feelings) the bestResident Evil game made, and this Re-release stays trueto the original game mechanics and controls.It took me around 12 hours to finish this game, after completingthe game once, you unlock 3 types of mini-games, ""Separate Ways""which lets you play as Ada Wong and see her side of the main storyspanning 5 stages, ""Ada's Assignment"" is a small minigame with1 stage only where you need to run around collecting stuff andfighting the Los Ganados, and then there's the ""Mercenaries""game which is a type of enemy-wave mode where you needto kill as many Ganados as you can within a time limit.The objective is to get the highest score possible, and basedon your completion and glory you get to unlock morecharacters to use in that game mode, this game modealso features 4 different stages.Completing these mini games will award you withcostume unlocks for the main characters during themain story game. After completing the game onceyou also unlock the New Game option, where youstart over again but with the equipment, ammo and weaponsyou had from your previous playthrough.The game did have problems at launch, several performanceproblems, basic elements in the game menu was missing,like Audio Options, unlogical PC control layout forinventory management and Quick-Time-Events.---CONCLUTION---This game will easily provide you with 17-25 hoursof enjoyment (main story + mini games), and evenmore hours if you decide to do a New Game playthrough.The game is a classic, and the game mechanics and controlsis not like the new modern games. If you're a veteran ofRE4 and have played the original releases, you willmost likely love this new re-release, but if you're newto this game, you might find the graphics andgameplay disappointing.The asking price is 20€. I think it is a tad too highfor a 8-9 year old game. So you have to decide for yourselfif the price is worth it. For me it was.---SCORE---I feel it's unfair to compare the graphics upagainst today's eyecandy games like Metro: Last Light,Crysis and Battlefield, so the graphics score will bebased on how good it is compared to how good it COULDhave been for this re-release.Because of a troubled launch, and some majorunlogical PC control decisions, this takes a big negativehit on the Gameplay score.Graphics: 7/10Story: 7/10Gameplay: 6/10Value: 8/10Score: 7.0/10			"

												I've played and owned this third-person shooter/survival horror masterpiece countless times before. I have some complaints, all of which are very minor:-I could only run this game efficiently at 30 FPS, windowed, and with low shadow quality. This of course may vary based on your own set-up.-I still have to open my inventory every time I want to switch weapons.-Lack of new content. This can also be a good thing. After all, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.Now the good:-Even at 30 FPS, windowed, and with low shadow quality RE4 still looks FANTASTIC. Honestly, the differences I saw between HD and Standard are so slight they may as well not exist.-Keyboard/mouse controls have that 'getting used to' phase, but quickly become very easy to use and responsive.-It's Resident Evil 4, need I go on?

												I jumped out of the window from the second story of a farm house, shot a guy in the face, roundhouse kicked him and the people next to him, and killed a crow that dropped a hand grenade. Afterwards, I came home to find RE 4 HD was on sale and bought the Hell out of it!When I think back to the games that brought me the most fun and joy, one of the first to pop into my mind is Resident Evil 4. To this day, it's still tied for my favorite game of all time. With a story that both terrifies me and makes me want to keep playing, linear gameplay that still encourages me to explore and has almost seemless chapter transition, an arsenal of weapons that makes me feel badass at one point and barely strong enough at others, and a lead protagonist who screams complete awesomeness, Resident Evil 4 is, for me, the highlight of the franchise as well as the highlight of my entire gaming career.

												One of my favorite games ever, I've played it over 6 times to completion now.  Everything about it from the cheesy scenes, the gun animations, the merchant, the boss battles, the other characters is just wonderful.  I just love everything about this game.  It's a 3rd person action/adventure I suppose, the horror from past games isn't really here.  There is also the Mercenaries mode, professional mode and a slew of add ons made after the original release on Gamecube that gives this game an insane amount of conrent.  The game isn't really scary like former RE games but it's so much fun to play.  Easily worth the buy (this was the 3rd time I've bought it).If you're thinking about getting this, some modders are doing some crazy work here:http://www.re4hd.com/ "

It happens often anytime I switch the screens like say I go to the merchant or just simply press tab. Of course all I do is alt-tab back in but that crashed my game once so now I'm scared. This is something that should be looked into and fixed ASAP.My pc specs are AMD Phenom x4 965 OC'ed to 3.8ghz8gb DDR3 Kingstong HyperX ram at 1333mhzMSI Twin Frozr III GTX 560 TI 448 core			"

												Resident Evil 4: Ultimate HD Edition,a scare from the past or a ruined childhood?--ABOUT--Resident Evil 4 was originally released on the GameCube back in 2005,and claimed high critics and overall top scores.You play as Leon Kennedy, and your mission is to rescue Ashley Graham,the president's daugther. She's been kidnapped and brought to a villagesomewhere in Spain. And Leon soon realizes not everything is normal inthis village.This Re-release of Resident Evil 4 has been given the name Ultimate HD Edition,and features revamped textures, all of the bonus contents previously releasedon other platforms and improved PC controlls.--RREVIEW--First off I will start by saying that Resident Evil 4 was one of my favorite gamesduring my childhood. I loved the hell out of that game. UnfortunatelyI sold my old GameCube system many years ago, so when I sawthey were going to release it on Steam, I was genuinely happy,I could finally play it again, and it was the Ultimate edition.We need to understand that we're talking about a 8-9 year old game,and think back to when this game was released, this gamebroke bounderies for graphics and gameplay back then,and there's actually a limit to what they really can do withthis re-release. This is not Resident Evil 4 with Crysis graphics,it's the same good old engine as the original.The textures has been improved slightly, but there are HDmods out there that gives you even better textures.The gameplay is same as the original, clumsy-tank controlswhich adds the feeling of claustrophobia and panic when thezombies (Los Ganados) surrounds you.In 2014, we're used to tight responsive controls for the PC,so many will not like these old'days tank controls.Tank controls means there's a design aspect where youcan't look or turn around using your mouse. To turn aroundand change your walking direction you need to use yourA and D keys. For many this will bring frustration and agony,for others it's perfect game design which improves uponthe scare of the game.This is still to-date (based on personal feelings) the bestResident Evil game made, and this Re-release stays trueto the original game mechanics and controls.It took me around 12 hours to finish this game, after completingthe game once, you unlock 3 types of mini-games, ""Separate Ways""which lets you play as Ada Wong and see her side of the main storyspanning 5 stages, ""Ada's Assignment"" is a small minigame with1 stage only where you need to run around collecting stuff andfighting the Los Ganados, and then there's the ""Mercenaries""game which is a type of enemy-wave mode where you needto kill as many Ganados as you can within a time limit.The objective is to get the highest score possible, and basedon your completion and glory you get to unlock morecharacters to use in that game mode, this game modealso features 4 different stages.Completing these mini games will award you withcostume unlocks for the main characters during themain story game. After completing the game onceyou also unlock the New Game option, where youstart over again but with the equipment, ammo and weaponsyou had from your previous playthrough.The game did have problems at launch, several performanceproblems, basic elements in the game menu was missing,like Audio Options, unlogical PC control layout forinventory management and Quick-Time-Events.---CONCLUTION---This game will easily provide you with 17-25 hoursof enjoyment (main story + mini games), and evenmore hours if you decide to do a New Game playthrough.The game is a classic, and the game mechanics and controlsis not like the new modern games. If you're a veteran ofRE4 and have played the original releases, you willmost likely love this new re-release, but if you're newto this game, you might find the graphics andgameplay disappointing.The asking price is 20€. I think it is a tad too highfor a 8-9 year old game. So you have to decide for yourselfif the price is worth it. For me it was.---SCORE---I feel it's unfair to compare the graphics upagainst today's eyecandy games like Metro: Last Light,Crysis and Battlefield, so the graphics score will bebased on how good it is compared to how good it COULDhave been for this re-release.Because of a troubled launch, and some majorunlogical PC control decisions, this takes a big negativehit on the Gameplay score.Graphics: 7/10Story: 7/10Gameplay: 6/10Value: 8/10Score: 7.0/10			"

												Resident Evil 4 is great game (in my humble opinion the best from Resident Evil series) but had terrible port for PC from Playstation 2. Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD version recompenses all drawbacks, it has improved graphics and mouse support. Game is really long and challenging, it has a lot of puzzles and hard enemies. Controls are easy to learn and with mouse support it is easier than with game pad. Really great third person shooter with a lot of challenging puzzles. I recommend this game especially to PC players who were unsatisfied with original version published by Ubisoft.			"

												Resident Evil 4 (Also known as Biohazard 4 in Japan), is a third-person shooter/survival horror video game developed by Capcom Productions in 2005. It's a departure in the long running series and is considered to be a forerunner in the third-person shooter genre, making many enhancements to the established gameplay that have later become a standard.The game was released with a massively positive reception, winning multiple game of the year awards from different publicizations around the globe.When it comes to gameplay, RE4 takes the clunky controls from the original games and throws them into garbage bin. The camera is set up behind the main character and you can aim in full 3D, you can't however move while you're aiming. A brilliant idea from the developers, since this combined with the rather difficult aiming mechanic makes up for some truly terrifying situations where you have to aim precisely on the different pressure points the enemies have. You can pop their heads off, shoot them in the legs to make them fall and preserve ammunition by stabbing them, among various other things like explosives and disabling them by shooting their hands to remove their weaponry.Regardless, RE4 is a lot more action packed than the previous iterations in the series and therefore isn't as chilling. This, however, is compensated by some truly amazing set pieces and some of the best pacing you will EVER see in a video game. You will never have a dull moment playing this game, and if you already haven't, you should.So is there really something you can criticize about this game? Certainly! It doesn't have a memorable soundtrack, most of it is ambient which does fit the moody atmosphere quite well but isn't something i'd personally listen to while i go jogging in the morning. Speaking about atmosphere, the game does something unexpected a little bit after the halfway of the game. And, without spoiling anything goes absolutely INSANE.This however, is not an issue if you dont mind campy stuff. But will be a big problem to people who were enjoying the extremely serious and atmospheric nature of the game for the first 12 hours.Giant spanish robot midget Napoleon, what the ♥♥♥♥ Capcom!?:DIn the end, even 9 years after the release, this is a game YOU whoever you are should be playing. It's a horror/action classic that will never be forgotten and will be admired and imitated for years to come.PS. Since this is a review of the Ultimate HD Edition, i should note that the port is fine. But you shouldn't even consider getting this unless you have an X360 Controller for PC. The mouse and keyboard controls are absolutely awful.			"

												Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition (PC Port Review)FINALLY!!! Capcom is giving appropriate attention to giving the PC heads a proper HD port!!! We can all forget that last one >_>Performance: Runs great on my system, however I have heard others having performance issues. I am able to run in max settings at a stable 60 frames through out! No frame loss through out.Input: They nailed the K/M controls. X360 controls are the same as they were on consoles, I personally have forgotten my controller completely when playing on K/M. However, if you plan on playing with K/M unplug any other controllers as the input detection seems glitchy.Good/Bad? Okay, I'm a little biased here because Resident Evil 4 is my absolute favorite game of all time. But, this is an OK port. The game itself is still all there in all it's glory, but the small performance issues I've read up on, and the glitching controls for when you try and use K/M when controllers are plugged in is a bit disheartening that Capcom got lazy with it. Worth the purchase if you loved the Resident Evil series, and if you don't have a console and have yet to experience this amazing game? This is a great way to see what transpires in rural Europe with Leon.Game: 4.5/5Port: 3/5			"

												There's not much to say, it's the same good game, with solid gameplay, only a bit more shinier. And I do mean only a ""bit"" more. Feels like CAPCOM really didn't put much effort into making more textures, Since only character/enemy and maybe some boss enemy textures were redone, a few weapons and items look better, but I'd prefer more fidelity in making the whole game look better, rather than some of it's parts. There are a couple of guys doing a WHOLE retexture project, but as of now, it's still ~40% done at the moment. Might take a year or more for them to finish it, so I'd say do not rush it, and get it at a better sale price. 60fps setting does make the game run very smoothly, combat feels even more responsive than ever and it definitely helps with the signature clunky ""tank"" controls.However, if you by some random magical reason haven't played Resident Evil 4. Buy it, it's really worth it's price, especially for someone that hasn't played it at all.If you by chance do get this game, but want a little bit more out of the visuals, and don't want to do any heavy modding, you can always use SweetFX 1.5.1 (latest version). You can easily get this even from Skyrim Nexus, since you only need the base files. Either use the default settings, or browse in google for some player created presets (found at least 5-6 in the first seconds of searching) and find a preset to your liking. I highly recommend you check out http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/board/62/re4-modification-releasesThere are numerious ENB presets, SweetFX presets available. Also get the shader fix, which makes the game look A LOT better. Even if CAPCOM is lazy, doesn't mean that you can't make the game look better with a little bit of elbow grease.			"

												I’m kinda late to the party here, still please bear with me in case you're among those veterans of the PS2 version who now think that this game didn’t age well. For that was exactly what I was thinking (at first blush) when the ""ultimate HD edition"" came out. I found the graphics dated and outright hideous in places – the (supposedly) “HD” overhaul cannot be compared in any way to those of REmake and Zero HD, where textures range from nice to absolutely stunning. Furthermore I had real problems to get used to tank controls again - after all these years this control paradigm of old felt real clunky to me. And so, after about an hour and a half in, I shelved RE4 HD again. Instead I poured 200 hours into Mikami’s “The Evil Within”, which I personally think is indeed the spiritual successor to RE4. Regarding the Resident Evil franchise, I regularily played (and still play) the PC versions of RE5, RE6, REmake HD, Zero HD as well as Revelations 1&2. You see, I’m a fan of both the old survival horror games AND the newer, more action oriented games. That’s why there still always remained a certain itch to pick up and try out RE4 yet again.  I eventually did when I recently got wind of a modding project where two very dedicated guys are redoing all the textures to make them real HD (while at the same time keeping the look and feel faithful to the original). They’re not done yet, but they’re making fast progress and what they already have to show looks absolutely fantastic. Once the overhaul is complete, this game will look as good (and in places even better) as the later entries or remakes of the franchise. I originally planned on waiting for the whole texture modding project to be done, but then decided to give the unmodded version one last go. In my earlier attempts to do that, the main obstacle to enjoying RE4 like I used to were the tank controls. I imagine I’m not the only one with that problem, even though nobody dares to say it aloud for fear of getting the “Go and play CoD then” dress-down. Anyway, I can report that the uncomfortable feeling of not being in total control over my character completely went away once I decided to put some conscious effort into getting the controls down again. It turned out it was not that hard too, really: I felt comfortable again even before the first chapter was over. I now realize that the controls are not “clunky” at all, just different.I’m now enjoying the game very much again, and I’m very happy that I stayed with it. Taking the HD modding project into account, there’s really only one aspect of the game left where I think it didn’t age too well and that is Mikami’s decision to sometimes let enemies spawn where they physically shouldn’t (because you checked or cleared out that very room or section just a few seconds ago and there’s no way these guys could have entered from somewhere). He sure did this for “horror effect” back then, but nowadays it just feels wrong. All in all, this is a very minor annoyance, though, which definitely shouldn’t deter you from enjoying this game, which is not just a great classic, but a landmark of the history of gaming itself.P.S.: As a bonus I have posted in the comments section of this review a solution to the only potentially game breaking bug the ultimate HD edition for the PC has.

												Shinji Mikami's second masterpeice after the 1996 original: Resident Evil, and before his most recent masterpeice of 2014: The Evil Within.This is when the RE franchise took a step in a new direction and became an Action-Survival Horror Third Person Shooter. However, I believe solely due to Mikami's influence and direction that they got the formula correct. They kept most gameplay mechanics similar (I.E. Scarce Ammo, Scarce Health, Limited Movement), while also increasing the amount of action the player encounters, re-invigorating the franchise with a new light and giving the player the choice to either evade or confront.RESIDENT EVIL 4:Play as Leon Kennedy as he investigates a mysterious town lead by a sadistic cult. His mission: To rescue the President's daughter, Ashley Graham.The HD port is faithful to the original, while being the best version yet. Multiple optimizations, including but not limited to: 30/60 fps, 1080p resolution, and different grain filters.Normal, Hard, and Professional difficulties available.New game plus unlocks upon completion, only available for the difficulty level completed.*Official Horror Inventory Tetris Simulator 2005.

												An absolutely good classic game with slightly refurbished graphics.Most people's favourite Resident Evil game (of the more recent ones). It took me around 10 hours to beat, which is a fair amount of hours for a main story these days.Only annoying part is the quicktime events, which, lets face it, everyone hates.I've heard that this is a terrible port, with audio lag problems and stuff, which I can confirm, at least for my weak laptop.On my computer however it works perfectly fine at constant 60 FPS at 1080p with all details maxed out, my specs are:Intel i7-4770 | Geforce GTX 760 | 8 GB ramAs usual, I strongly recommend using a 360 controller with this game, but I guess any other halfway decent one will do.

												The phrase ""it's a good game, just not a good ___ game"" fits perfectly here. RE4 is mostly a campy action game with hints of horror here and there, but that doesn't mean it isn't great. The gameplay is solid and the devs knew exactly what makes a story about an American hero who takes on an army of foreigners to save the president's daughter charming and hilarious in its absurdity. The gameplay is fun, the campaign is excellently paced and the extras like Mercenaries can be addictive.			"

												I played Resident Evil 4 back in 2007/2008 with a Gamepad-Controller (Mouse + Keyboard were impossible to play) and it was such a masterpiece. In my Opinon the best Resident Evil Game from the Series. I lost my CD so i decided to buy the Steam HD Version. Its pretty the same Version as 2007 but my old controller didn't worked well with this Version, because i couldn't fully configure my controller, i experimented with the config file, but it didn't helped, so i played it with Mouse + Keyboard and i have to say: its ankward. First you have to configure your config file with a guide on steam or the character will rotate instead of the camera, without it's not playable and sometimes the character is moving ankwardly. The second big problem i noticed is the savegame spot, since the savegames are tied to your steam account u can't copy an other savegame from the internet and play, no you have to repeat normal difficulty to play professional, very bad, no idea why they changed it and there is no way to manipulate the save file, the only working part is money freezing but that's not a big deal. The Achievements are a nice extra but it could have been a lot more. The HD-Textures are a total joke, the only thing i noticed: the characters looked more detailed, but all other textures still looked the same.TLDR:-The HD-Textures are a joke, characters more detailed, other textures still looking bad.-Savegames are tied to your Steam-Account so changing/manipulating Savefiles are impossible.-Nice Achievements, but it could have been a lot more in my Opinion.-Mouse+Keyboard Controlling are available, but it needs a manually change in the config files via a guide or it's not playable (the character will rotate instead of the camera).Would i recommended this game? Totally yes, but to be honest, i liked the old 2007 PC-Version more. "

												Many of you are probably already familiar with the game. RE4 is the turning point of the franchise. Capcom decided to change the way you play the game simply because REmake and Zero didn't sell well (GameCube). For the first time Resident Evil was fully 3D with behind the shoulder camera. Many people loved it and called it the best RE ever made, many people hated it and said that it's the reason behind the downfall of RE series, others liked both old and new. Will you like it? That's for you to decide.Just like in my other REviews I'll make a list of pros and cons. This time obviously I'll compare it to both oldschool and newschool REs. So, here's a list of alphabetical pros and cons:Pros:-Camera. It's been finally patched and now you can choose between classic and centered camera. Whatever you like the most, that is.-Characters. RE4 features characters we already like (especially Wesker, heheh) and introduces bunch of new cool ones.-DLCs. RE4UHD features all available extra content there is for free! Separate Ways, Assignment Ada, Mercenaries. No need to buy them.-Enemies. New undiscovered enemies add extra scare factor.-Graphics. The game now runs in 1080p @ 60fps. there are some extra effects such as motion blur, post processing. The game's main story features real time rendered cutscenes.-Melee. Now you have a knife that doesn't take inventory space. Also now you can do special moves (basically coup de grâce but they're not always lethal).-Mercenaries. RE is well known for it's mercenaries mode in which with the given time limit you kill as many enemies as possible. It's a really fun mode and everyone should try it.-Mods. You can expect to see model, texture and even ambient effects mods!-Puzzles. Just like in old times there are few puzzles mixed in.-Replay value. The game has a decent replay value, especially with extra items you can earn, plus it allows you save all your end game's equipment and transfer it to a new game (obviously within borders of one difficulty).-Single player. ~70% of the time you're alone which is (of course) better (and more scary) than being with someone.-Soundtrack. The game features a good soundtrack. -Survival Horror. Still somewhat scary.-Upgrades. You can upgrade your weapons! A really satisfying (but less realistic) feature. And as an extra you can attach thing to your weapons (stock, scope).-Variety of weapons. Knife, handguns, shotguns, rifles. magnums, TMP, bowgun, RPG, mine thrower and other bonus weapons!-Weather. Unlike in previous installments which had almost static weather (always night) RE4's weather changes with the areas/chapters.Cons:-Characters. There are few characters people would like to forget about. Mainly Salazar and Ashley.-Controls. Might be one of the biggest problems here. I'm not saying that the controls are bad. They're were OK when the game was released and still can be mastered. However, the horror that is crafted by the expense of the controls is a matter of discussion. You can't dodge or counter, the controls are tanky, but now there's finally a native mouse support.-Enemies. There are no beloved zombies. Only parasite (Las Plagas) controlled humans and other species.-Escort. ~30% of the time you have to escort a person with you. Sometimes you can hide him, sometimes there's no other way but to fight with him. It's possible to accidentally kill this person (enemies can kill too, y'know) which will result in ""Mission Failed"" screen.-Graphics (and Performance). RE4UHD allows you to play at anti-aliased 1080p, 60fps. That's pretty much it as the ""HD"" textures are ...erm... ""Capcom HD"" as in barely HD at all. There's a big inconsistency going on when there are extremely old blurry together with higher res new ones. Also one more thing should be mentioned. Some textures look more cleaner than the old ones aka less scary.-QTEs. The QTEs here are unforgiving. They give you somewhere around 1.5 seconds to react and some of them require great button mashing skills.-Story. Barely any.I can't remember everything, so excuse me if I forgot something.I tried to make the pros and cons list bias-free, but it seems like I did not satisfy the fanboys.Final verdict: it's a love/hate relationship. So play the game and see it for yourself.			"

												Resident Evil 4 - Одна из лучших игр в жанре Survival Horror,одна из лучших игр в серии Resident Evil, генеальнейшая игра,одна из первых игр с видом от пелча.Игра вышла в 2005 году,эксклюзивно для приставки Nintendo GameCube,через 8 месяцев игра вышла на PlayStration 2. После портирования PS версии начали портировать на ПК,заключив договор об издательстве с Ubisoft. Порт получился очень плохим,графика была куда хуже,чем даже на PS2 и целится приходилось с помощью клавиш. Через 7 лет вышел Ремастер с подзаголовком Ultimate HD Edition. Графика была улучшена,добавлено адекватное управление и разрешение тоже завезли.Сюжет Resident Evil 4 рассказывает историю Леона Кеннеди,которому было дано задание спасти президентскую дочку. Которая,по неким сведениям была увезена в деревню. По прибытию Леона ждёт сюрприз,ввиде нового вида паразитов.			"

												What can I say about it?  It's influenced just about every game after it and does it better than most of them.  The game that introduced the over-the-shoulder camera that zooms in for aiming your gun, is this.The game is the perfect action horror shooter.  It killed my favourite series, and I prefer the classics, but it is potentially the best single-player third-person shooter to date.  Something about the mechanics, they're so fine-tuned that everything is addictively rewarding.Mechanics, now that brings me to an important point:  the game uses tank controls, which in 2005 none of us noticed actually, but apparently a lot of younger gamers find INSANE.  Poor sods.  Well, if you just try to get used to the controls, you'll find it is perhaps the most balanced combat system designed.  You see my 51 hours on record here?  That is the tiniest fraction of the time I've spent playing this game on various consoles.  Because every single enemy in the game is designed to use tank controls just like you, and it just works perfectly.The game is on average a good 20-25 hours if you're not rushing, and is so wonderfully varied and evolving over the course of it, that the moment you're done playing it on Normal, you'll probably want to get going on Professional, and you absolutely should; the game is utterly different.  Professional changes several things, like enemy AI (dramatically), enemy placement, enemy health, and enemy damage.  Several surprises occur on professional that won't in Normal.Beyond that, Assignment Ada is a decent hour of play, and Separate Ways is at least five (can't remember, could be more).  And then there's Mercenaries.  On the surface a simple arcade game where you just kill things a lot.  But the majority of my time on record here has been spent in Mercenaries, and that's because when you have combat mechanics this good, you can really rely on them to carry something.  RE4 continues the RE tradition of fantastic mini-games that rival the main game in how engaging they are.The story is more ridiculous than any RE before it and it's fantastically enjoyable.  Leon is like a caricature of the Hollywood action hero and it's hilarious.  Oh, and an RE's American main character is finally played by a person that isn't blatantly obviously Canadian, not that I cared before, because it was funny.  I don't know what kind of name is Osmond Saddler but I don't think it's Spanish.  Anyway, it has a story that keeps the game going despite being really really stupid.  It's charming.  You'll like it.People that are new to Resident Evil and see both this and the Resident Evil Remake remaster on Steam, they're utterly different games and styles.  The Remake is the true survival horror style the series had from 1996 until 2003, and RE4 in 2005 is the first of the action style the series retains to this day (though RE4's atmosphere does horror really well, unlike later RE games).That's the majority of what needs to be said.  I'll finish by saying that this port is good overall, but lazy as all hell when it comes to making it 'HD'.  Some people report problems that occur at 60fps which didn't occur in older versions at 30fps and can be solved by setting the game at 30fps, but I have had no problems in this regard (though the rifle animation is still at 30fps so it looks ridiculous).  However, the true HD mod that's coming out looks glorious and worth getting this port for, if it's HD you're looking for.Additionally, the gamepad controls work really great in my opinion, though I do not appreciate having to use a mod if I want to change the configuration, and a lot of people say the keyboard and mouse controls are great.  My one problem is that the right analogue stick appears to have only the four cardinal directions as opposed to true analogue or even an eight-way directional system.  I never felt weird using it in any other version and I've played them all.That's it.  10/10, buy it unless you're a closed-minded bell-end and you really can't bear the thought of a control system that's mildly differernt to the one you like, or if you really hate action games (although even there, I know people that don't love action games that were won over by this game because it's that good).  Buy it.			"

												This ""Ultimate HD Edition"" of the survival-action ganado blastin' classic, while at its core a port of the PS3/360 HD release,lives up to its name by offering several unique aspects such as a 60 FPS mode (while still offering the original 30 for those wanting a pure experience) as well as completely redone HD textures compared to the simply upscaled console versions.In short, this PC version is right up there as THE definitive version of RE4 to date. Be wary that these unique options does require higher specs than you'd think, so be sure to look at 'em before buying.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played and definitely one of the most influential in my life. This was one of the first games (Other than Super Mario 64 & Super Mario Sunshine) I've ever played and really dumped hours into in my early years of gaming. Other than being absolutely wonderful with gaming mechanics but it perfected the third-person over the shoulder camera angle. This new innovative angling of the camera gave this game the winning seat in the entire franchise. The economy works well in this game, is not buggy, and you can not really glitch your way to unlocking everything in a short period of time. It also rewards you for beating on higher difficulties and replaying the game. I've beaten this game 10 times and I still find amusement playing it again and again. Most titles I can never find myself coming back too but this game was definitely one I'd gladly sit around and play all day. While it is ok on the computer, I had my most fond memories playing on my gamecube but I am still glad that valve had published it to Steam. While also having a huge influence on myself it has also had a huge influence on fps and other genre's of games. At times, it may seem dumb but still to this day it scares me. When I first downloaded it for steam I was scared to go into the starting village knowing I'd be facing Dr. Salvador. It literally took my 3 whole days to man up and finally go in. Even those game is older it has aged quite well and still remains good to this day. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an amazing and nostalgic game.			"

												This review will focus on the overall quality of the port and ""updated"" textures. Also if the game itself is still up to par.TEXTURES AND PORT QUALITYPros:+The updated enviorments, character models, and texture quality look much better than the previous versions*+Mouse and keyboard support, and it works*+Load times are wonderfully quick compared to the earlier versionsCons:-The increased texture on the game gradually becomes less apparent less than half way through the game.-Majority of the textures in the game are either untouched, or just smeared.-Mouse and keyboard work, but feels too slow and sometimes unresponsive. Highly recommend a Xbox 360 controller.-The Separate Ways side story still has the terrible looking pre-rendered cutscenesOVERALL GAMEPros:+Great production quality and still holds up+Great boss battles+Varied enemy design+Very balanced diffculty curve+Music and over all graphics are very good+The game play is till top notch* and satisfying+Pretty long game, and play time can vary tremendously on how well you play+Ton of content and replayabilityCons:-The controls are very dated and takes time to get used to-Ashley is an idiot.-/+The story is not really that engaging, but the lore behind the village people and the infection is pretty interestingI'd say if you can get passed the controls you will have a awesome time with this game; RE4's focus is primarly the game play, so its very hit or miss if you will like it. I don't think any issues on the behalf of the porting job should detract you from enjoying it.			"

But the majority of my time on record here has been spent in Mercenaries, and that's because when you have combat mechanics this good, you can really rely on them to carry something.  RE4 continues the RE tradition of fantastic mini-games that rival the main game in how engaging they are.The story is more ridiculous than any RE before it and it's fantastically enjoyable.  Leon is like a caricature of the Hollywood action hero and it's hilarious.  Oh, and an RE's American main character is finally played by a person that isn't blatantly obviously Canadian, not that I cared before, because it was funny.  I don't know what kind of name is Osmond Saddler but I don't think it's Spanish.  Anyway, it has a story that keeps the game going despite being really really stupid.  It's charming.  You'll like it.People that are new to Resident Evil and see both this and the Resident Evil Remake remaster on Steam, they're utterly different games and styles.  The Remake is the true survival horror style the series had from 1996 until 2003, and RE4 in 2005 is the first of the action style the series retains to this day (though RE4's atmosphere does horror really well, unlike later RE games).That's the majority of what needs to be said.  I'll finish by saying that this port is good overall, but lazy as all hell when it comes to making it 'HD'.  Some people report problems that occur at 60fps which didn't occur in older versions at 30fps and can be solved by setting the game at 30fps, but I have had no problems in this regard (though the rifle animation is still at 30fps so it looks ridiculous).  However, the true HD mod that's coming out looks glorious and worth getting this port for, if it's HD you're looking for.Additionally, the gamepad controls work really great in my opinion, though I do not appreciate having to use a mod if I want to change the configuration, and a lot of people say the keyboard and mouse controls are great.  My one problem is that the right analogue stick appears to have only the four cardinal directions as opposed to true analogue or even an eight-way directional system.  I never felt weird using it in any other version and I've played them all.That's it.  10/10, buy it unless you're a closed-minded bell-end and you really can't bear the thought of a control system that's mildly differernt to the one you like, or if you really hate action games (although even there, I know people that don't love action games that were won over by this game because it's that good).  Buy it.			"

												This ""Ultimate HD Edition"" of the survival-action ganado blastin' classic, while at its core a port of the PS3/360 HD release,lives up to its name by offering several unique aspects such as a 60 FPS mode (while still offering the original 30 for those wanting a pure experience) as well as completely redone HD textures compared to the simply upscaled console versions.In short, this PC version is right up there as THE definitive version of RE4 to date. Be wary that these unique options does require higher specs than you'd think, so be sure to look at 'em before buying.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played and definitely one of the most influential in my life. This was one of the first games (Other than Super Mario 64 & Super Mario Sunshine) I've ever played and really dumped hours into in my early years of gaming. Other than being absolutely wonderful with gaming mechanics but it perfected the third-person over the shoulder camera angle. This new innovative angling of the camera gave this game the winning seat in the entire franchise. The economy works well in this game, is not buggy, and you can not really glitch your way to unlocking everything in a short period of time. It also rewards you for beating on higher difficulties and replaying the game. I've beaten this game 10 times and I still find amusement playing it again and again. Most titles I can never find myself coming back too but this game was definitely one I'd gladly sit around and play all day. While it is ok on the computer, I had my most fond memories playing on my gamecube but I am still glad that valve had published it to Steam. While also having a huge influence on myself it has also had a huge influence on fps and other genre's of games. At times, it may seem dumb but still to this day it scares me. When I first downloaded it for steam I was scared to go into the starting village knowing I'd be facing Dr. Salvador. It literally took my 3 whole days to man up and finally go in. Even those game is older it has aged quite well and still remains good to this day. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an amazing and nostalgic game.			"

Very rewarding ""Side-Pathing"" to get treasures, clues, puzzles, and of course~ Guns >:3  The game encourages it, especially since the best overall shotgun is one you find inside a damn barn. But remember, using a keyboard a mouse is not something you wanna do when you play this game. Due to ""lol quicktime events"" The Resident Evil series has presented for quite sometime. I suggest picking it up and if you know me, message me about it. I'd be glad to help anyone else enjoy this amazing immersive game.			"

												When released back in 2005, Resident Evil 4 was the first in the series marking a shift away from the Survival Horror genre to a more Action-oriented style, with an over-the-shoulder perspective. Whilst this game retains a haunting soundtrack and fear inducing moments of its predecessors, some ' Old Skool ' fans of the series will miss the older pre-rendered backdrops and thought provoking puzzles which made the first 3 games genuine classics. This 2014 HD-remastered version has been polished and boasts a smoother 60fps framerate. Resident Evil 4 was originally released for consoles, so you'll get the best playing experience using an Xbox 360 controller. My only gripe with this port is the audio during weapon reloading is out of sync, and more effort should have been given to keyboard & mouse support.			"

												If you don't remember, back in 2005 the Resident Evil francise was pretty niche and regarded as a bit of a fad from the previous console generation. That was until Resident Evil 4 was released that year for the GameCube, blowing everything and everyone away with it's incredible story and mix of Survival Horror and Action/Shooter gameplay.X-Play (the game review show on G4) went ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for RE4, I remember them specifically because I watched that show every night, and rightly so. Its won numerous awards from pretty much every major award giving body in the industry, and has settled at a near perfect 96/100 on MetaCritic (for what that's worth). Now the Resident Evil francise is known as an action oriented horror series, but this game is where it all got started. I've only played about the first hour of the game, but thats enough to tell you that this is just as good as the original version in performance, but with the added bonuses of the later versions and new ""HD"" textures.The controls are exactly like the GameCube's, which some people seem to be complaining about. This game was made for these controls and they only take a second of gameplay to get used to. If learning the controls to a game are going to keep you from playing it, then why do you own a steam account?The ""HD"" textures are just ok, they make it look as good as it looked back in 2005, but on your 1080p PC, which is great. Some textures even look better than they used to, but its kinda pick and choose.Overall, if you've never played this game before, make sure to pick it up now that this is probably the final release of the classic game. If you have played it before, buy it again to play through all the new content! This game will never dissapoint.			"

												This version of RE4 delivers on most of the promises as it can be played in 1080p and 60 frames per second with all the settings turned up to max (If your system can handle it that is!). It works great with KB+M or a 360 controller so you can use what suits you best. All is well so far but there are some problems which I have to mention.1. The textures aren't upgraded much so the visuals will not blow your mind2. When reloading the bolt-action rifle the fps had a drop (despite being locked at 60FPS) but quickly went back to 60 3. The climbing up from ledges Quick Time Events to prevent falling are almost impossible to complete on the first try (or the 10 next attempts) and could potentially lead to damaging the buttons on your keyboard or controller you have to mash to complete them (Chapter 4-3 ledge climb and the chase sequence in 4-4 are the biggest offenders)If you have trouble with the QTEs I mentioned above, lock the frame rate to 30 via the config.ini, find the part that says variableframerate, change the number from 60 to 30, complete QTE and change it back after you've done it.The config.ini is located at: C:\Users\yourname\Documents\My Games\Capcom\RE4 Also the cutscene quality in the Separate ways bonus campaign is rubbish but not in the main game which is weird as several of the cutscenes are reused from the main game.Despite these issues I'd still recommend the game if you've never played RE4. Personal rating: 7/10			"

												A classic and still amazing survival action experience, but the PC port is almost barebones to a fault. It works and plays beautifully, even if the 60fps conversion makes some of Leon's animations look hilarious (Gotta QTE fast!). There are no audio options to speak of whatsoever, and surround mixing appears limited to 2 channels. This is still a game defined by its very distinct tank style controls. A gamepad is necessary because it feels right, and because mouse and keyboard does not (as in, it tries to mimic the gamepad through acceleration and it just feels off). Texture work is cleaned up considerably and the image is properly scaled to 16:9. This is still a GameCube remaster so don't expect the world, but I've a fondness for graphics from that era anyway so everything looks fine to me. Also, turn off motion blur, because it's atrocious and not the modern, good kind of per-pixel or object motion blur. With the tech out of the way, a couple of reasons why Mikami's RE offshoot still remains one of the greatest games ever made. Pacing? Action, exploration and setpiece are carefully balanced and generously doled out with each passing moment. There is zero filler. Tension? Ever present and punctuated by moments of calm and recollection. That amazing 'Serenity' track during safe zones. Variety? You could be careening down a minecart in one moment; fighting your way out of a kill box in the next; be hunted by invisible predators down sewage tunnels; or solve any number of the simple but rewarding puzzles. There is rarely a repeated scenario, and if there is, it's subtly tweaked and inserted where you wouldn't expect it, which takes us to another point: gameplay. Though encounters are generally scripted, how they play out manages to be dynamic each time depending on your preparation and reactions. There is never an idle moment: this ain't a cutscene, PRESS A. The flow of battle is incredible too. You can efficiently shoot heads off, but the plagas that may sprout throw a wrench into your plan. You can line up a rifle shot and clear out rows of enemies like bowling pins. You can incapacitate a leg and go for Leon's suplex (still some of the simplest but most satisfying combos in games). Or you may deliberately time a roundhouse attack for its i-frames. Swapping between attache case and real-time action may seem cumbersome, but it actually affords an almost turn-based pacing to the encounters as you quickly dive into your inventory to swap for a grenade in the heat of the moment - think Parasite Eve on PSX.RE4 has it all: ageless gameplay, masterful pacing, a cast of exceptionally dumb RE villains and most of all, THE GREATEST reload animations ever. This game is preeeety good.			"

												A solid action with occasional moments of horror, and in its own right it's a well-crafted and enjoyable game. Long-term players were divided on the change of direction we saw with #4, and I'm personally divided; for me it come down to story and realismThe original Resi's were believable, with human (read: mortal) characters who weren't roundhouse kicking or engaging in arial knife fights, they were your average police officers. The virus was a fantastic premise and the non-zombie monsters were mutations of animals or lab projects; this all added to believability.It's a real shame that Resident Evil threw all that away for the generic, over-the-top cartoon characters we have in #4 (well, really Code Veronica onwards to be fair) as this, in my opinion, is the biggest thing that is holding RE4 back. This is more Resident Evil meets House of the Dead in terms of story and characters and would have been incredible as a seperate series from Resident Evil given how far the story has departed from its roots, and it would have been awesome!But anyway, I digress!If you can look past all this (which I recommend you do) you will find a solid and enjoyable action / horror with interesting enemies and combat. Ammo is plentiful and there's plenty of variety in weapons to choose from, which is good as there are plenty of enemies! There is a bit of a tactical approach to combat this time around, as you're able to shoot projectiles out of the air and shooting an enemy in the knee, arm or head will cause different reactions. To be really efficient on harder difficulties you'll want to play skillfully, shooting the dynamite in an enemies hand will blow it up and take out all nearby enemies, and staggering an enemy and roundhouse kicking them will send the group flying (sometimes off cliffs) and then there's the environment...You can baricade doors, jump through virtually any window and kick down ladders. The sense of tension as you have enemies approaching from all angles is very well done.So would I recommend this game? Definitely. It's bittersweet as I think we all know Capcom have lost their way over the years, and this started when they lost their direction with their various series' (what are they doing over there?), but despite that here's a lot of fun to be had here. As a story it was at best a medicore B-movie, but as an action it was second to none for it's time and holds up pretty well even today.			"

												Whenever I played this game on consoles when a friend brought it over/had it, I wasn't able to get past the village.  Now that I've forced my way through that roadblock, I can see that this is as fun of a game now as everyone had said it was when it came out.  Like everything before RE6, this is tank controls, stand still to aim.  You have to be mindful of your lack of sidestep, which has gotten me axed to the face a few times.QTEs still kind of annoying, though.  Switching from mashing X to pressing L+R is kind of hard for me, and smashing the stick back and forth is not great either.Having fun overall, though.  I speared a fish, and ate it.  I killed a snake, took the golden egg it was gaurding/had eaten whole, and sold it.  I tetrised the inventory.			"

												5/5At this point in gaming history there's nothing else I could add about Resident Evil 4 that isn't common knowledge; a game that clearly inspired and raised the bar for upcoming releases (sadly not for the ones from the same franchise), survival horror redefined, with an iconic recipe to blend humour and action, probably the first game to introduce interactive cutscenes (learned that the hard way:Verdugo throws Leon's own knife back at him) along with a new targeting system for the genre and for the first time ever... the most efficient and polite black market dealer we could ever expect at the turn of a corner.The Good:- With the exception of a fairly easy final battle, the rest can be considered absolute perfection.The Bad:- The main purpose of your mission, first daughter Ashley Graham can be a ""little"" annoying to mantain safe and alive.The Ugly:- Mostly everybody that isn't on your side.""Stranger, ha ha, what do ya' need that for, goin' huntin' an elephant?""

												Without a doubt, one of the best games ever made. I've bought Resident Evil 4 four(heh) times, now. Gamecube, PS2, Xbox 360, and PC. And everytime I do, I beat it at least once or twice-- 7 so far in terms of PC. And oddly enough, PC was my first attempt at Professional mode and it was a blast. RE4 is the perfect blend of over the top action, difficulty and exploration that very few games, modern and not have ever reached.It's also super fun to speedrun!			"

												Best port for Resident Evil 4 so far. The controls for the PC may be a bit dodgy at first, and may take a little tweeking in the options, but once you get the hang of it, it's super fluint and works wonderfully. My only complaint is sometimes whenever I enter my inventory to equip another weapon, I leave the inventory and Leon for no reason yet known to me turns around in the complete opposite direction away from the enemies, and it usually results in taking a hit or even getting killed. This happens a lot and I don't know if it's a glitch or what, but it does get annoying once it happens the 5th or 6th time.			"

												I've beaten this game numerous times on PS2 and so far, from what I've experienced, the HD version of RE 4 on PC is a nostalgic trip down memory lane.  The textures have been sharpened nicely, the lighting effects are pretty, and the water reflections are more noticeable.  As a diehard RE fan, I believe 4 was the last amazing installment in the entire series considering it was at this point where the games core mechanics drastically changed, ie, third person, elimination of top-down camera angles that only altered upon entering different rooms (which I miss desperately because they increased the sense of fear and suspense throughout  playing, even though there were critics who believed this point of view made controls more difficult), combat moves such as kicking Ganados when they're stunned, weapon upgrades, collecting relics worth money TO upgrade/modify/buy weapons, inventory size, etc; the list goes on and on.  Ultimately, though, RE 4 is an excellent game that introduced a plethora of features never before seen or utilized in the series prior to this installment.  It was a fantastic game on the Gamecube, PS2 and yes, it's even better for the PC when you take into the consideration that, if your PC can handle it, the 60 fps makes an enormous difference in your gameplay. My only con with the game so far is the mouse and keyboard controls.  I realize this is just preference and can be fixed by using a 360 controller, which I intend on doing, but overall these controls are difficult to adjust to at first.  Other than that, what are you waiting for? Get this now and relive a piece of gaming history!			"

												rebinding keys are great,  but the mouse still sucks, which needs to be fixed, you have to move left or right arrow just to turn, the mouse will not, very, very bad in battle, or running, and you can't run left or right, only forward, they need to fix this old style gaming controls, all pc games should have controls similar to doom3, or like tomb raider reboot, this should be the standard, and the people who made these games should update the controls with patches, AS you all ready know, the old doom 1, 2 have no updates on the controls, and old tomb raider games 1 to 5 do not have mouse support, and there is maybe even more, that i don't know of, AND it seems that the companies do not care to listen, and talk to these developers in updating thier games, hence you are going to buy a game with joy, and find out it does not play, lost your money, like a thief pick your pocket, and last, you do not have my permission to remake resident evil 2 and 3 which would make the perfect set collections, until you fix the mouse and more rebinding keys, similar to tomb raider reboot, this is a major steam problem, so buyer beware.

												I played this game a while ago on the PS2 and just loved it, the atmosphere and the gameplay are just a great mix of horror and action. It teaches you to play the game as it is meant to be, what is good if you ask me. You can't just play as you want just using one weapon that you like, different situations need to be solved in different ways, thats what you learn by failing all the time if you don't pay attention. Although i had really big problems with the controls at the beginning i recommend playing it. The console versions may be easier to handle but you will learn how to play the game with your mouse and keyboard pretty fast until you won't notice that the controls bothered you at first. The graphics are quite well considering how old the game is, even though i didn't notice the changes of the HD remake all to much. So if you like zombies, horror and some action then this game might be just perfect for you.			"

												First of all, give you a favor and play that game with a xbox controler...forget the k/mPros:Still the best Resident Evil (arguably).If you never played it it's a not brainer...buy it.High resolution and all side contents included.Cons:The game lagged sometimes ,and it's a 10 years old game, so even with 60fps, there is no excuses.They say the game is HD and the texture is high res. Well thats true, but some are still low res so the game is now really uneven in his pixel ratio.The fact thats its HD doesn't help on the whole look of the game... the gamecube and wii version looked a lot better because the tv added some smudginess and grain, making everything more creepy and real.Not the best port i played, if you can stick with the old console version don't buy it, otherwise don't hesitate.

												I had never actually played this game, so when I figured with the HD release it was probably time.Overall, I'm glad I did. RE4 is still a fun game and is overall a very enjoyable experience.Mechanically, it all works as expected. The graphics aren't fantastic or anything, but definitely playable. About what you'd expect from a 10 year old remaster. The controls are wonky in that Resident Evil way, but the game is built around them so they work well enough.Honestly, if you're reading this, you've probably already played RE4 and you're just wondering if the HD PC version is good. It is.If you haven't played it before, you're in for a pretty good time. With Separate Ways (a mini campaign unlocked after beating the game), it took me about 18 hours. Good value.			"

I own this game aback on the ps2, I have to buy it again after all this year and now on a new platform Resident Evil 4 follows the story of Leon on a mission to save the presidents daughter and getting caught up with the twisted nature of the natives. The first Biohazard game story sticks true to the Capcon game style. While on your mission you slowly realise something is not right with the villagers.

												I have played through Resident Evil 4 probably fifteen times, and before I die I will probably play through it fifteen more. It's the kind of game that always feels good to play--it has challenging but masterable combat mechanics, an addicting weapon upgrade system, and most importantly, wonderful level design and environments. There's no respectable story to speak of, which makes the game all the more remarkable since it manages to snare the player solely on the merits of its design and mechanics. The main reason I keep playing Resident Evil 4 is because I enjoy being in the game's environments. Sure, there are a lot of locations in the game that are absolutely miserable, but those locations are an essential half of a contrasting environment dynamic the Resident Evil games have always deployed. To build tension and horror, Resident Evil games cram the player into dark, cramped, filthy places, and it's only after the player has managed to make it through these uncomfortable spaces that they are rewarded with a ""safe"" space, usually an area with a typewriter (for saving games) and no enemies. I've always liked the atmosphere of these areas, but in Resident Evil 4 they are especially wonderful. Often these safe spaces appear outdoors after the player has been trudging through some claustrophobic indoor location, and the experience can really feel like a breath of fresh air. This tension-and-release dynamic also makes the game really satisfying to play, because the player feels like they've earned each moment of peace and safety.The combat mechanics in Resident Evil 4 took some flak when the game first launched in 2005 because Leon can move and attack, but he can't do both at the same time. Of course, anyone who understands the need for tension-building in horror will recognize the ignorance of those complaints. One of the big reasons RE4's combat is so compelling is because of Leon's mobility handicap; it feels really stressful to be anchored in place while a horde of enemies creeps ever closer, and it feels really rewarding to survive a hairy encounter by skillfully knowing when to move and when to shoot. As I said before, RE4's story is pretty terrible. Still, the game has excellent pacing which is set by the level design and enemy frequency. Unlike earlier Resident Evil games, there's not a lot of area recursion in RE4, so the game feels like it's always progressing quickly even though it takes nearly 15-20 hours to complete. Resident Evil 4's weapon upgrade system functions in tandem with a simple yet addicting in-game economy based around treasure hunting. Unique treasures are hidden throughout the game world, and players who find them can sell them and purchase new weapons and upgrades. The game economy is well-balanced, and the weapon upgrades always feel like they're popping up at just the right moments--more evidence that the game was meticulously planned out. I always like my survival horror games to be on the difficult side, and from my experience, the original GameCube version of RE4 had lower values for treasure items, making the upgrades slightly harder to get and the game more difficult. The PS2 and Steam versions of the game seem comparatively easy to me, even on Professional difficulty. There are some things I've found in this world that, despite their dark themes and focus on death, give me a surprising feeling of calm and comfort--the now defunct band ""The Paper Chase""[thepaperchase.bandcamp.com] and the YouTube channel ""Ask A Mortician"" are examples. I also add Resident Evil 4 to this list. Yes, it is the game where my heart races as I carefully count the number of shotgun shells I've unloaded into the chainsaw-wielding monster trying to decapitate me, but it is also the game where I step out onto moonlit castle battlements, my footsteps on the cobblestone breaking through the quiet night and startling a murder of crows away from a gem-filled fountain. Resident Evil 4 is a game full of spaces and experiences to which I will always return.			"

												Resident Evil 4 may have celebrated its 11th birthday, but it doesn't feel a day old. Having never really played RE4 before (or any Resident Evil, for that matter), I set out to play what many consider to be a best survival horror/3rd person shooter ever. They were correct.The gunplay is tight and visceral. Giving you a tight camera that narrows your vision and can only be flipped quickly enough with a quick key press while also forcing yourself to stand still when taking shots creates a large amount of anxiety and fear as you enter gunplay, yet the entire game is designed around these facts, which means you rarely feel cheated or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tted. The atmosphere is incredible. After a few cutscenes to set the mood, you find yourself alone in a Spanish village filled with large amounts of ""zombies"" seeking your death at once. The pure tension found within seconds is admirable, but it manages to carry that tension and atmosphere for quite a large portion of the game before hitting the full action stride. To tell you the truth, I've never played a true horror game before, and found myself having to save and quit numerous times in short intervals in the beginning,The survival is real. You'll find yourself counting your shots and making every last bullet count as ammo and health is apparently scarce--at first, anyway. You always have to be careful when faced with a large horde of enemies or a bossfight--you never know what's going to empty your ammo supply and force you to utilize your knife.The story and dialogue is cheesy as hell, but it's incredibly fun and fits the game like a glove. While maintaining a serious presence, it isn't afraid to make you laugh or throw in a ridiculous scenario or set piece every once in awhile.Resident Evil 4 is a solid 10/10. To me, I find absolutely no faults in this game whatsoever, and I'm excited to go through all of the bonus content and new game+.			"

The end of an era and the beginning of another...Prior to Resident Evil 4, previous games in the series were known for it's isometric levels, tanky controls, claustraphobic environments and limited (but scary) zombies. In 2005 Capcom changed the formula and released Resident Evil 4 which began the action series as well as inspiring games such as Dead Space.PlotYou play as Leon S. Kennedy, a former police rookie (resi 2), now US secret agent tasked with rescuing the president's daughter (Ashley) from a group of cultists. In the remote european village, Leon discovers that there are far greater forces at play here and a sinister plot which threatens the world.GameplayGameplay is the main highlight here. The game is presented as a third-person shooter, like later installments. Levels compose of areas which the player must go through until they reach the end. Each area has enemies and traps hinder your progress. There are a wide variety of enemies including, but not limited to: dogs, melee/range guys, flying insects etc. Further more, there is a wide cast of bosses and mini bosses which each require different strategies and tactics to takedown. To assist you, there  are typewriters which you can use to save the game. A merchant may be also located in the area, which allows to to buy new weapons, upgrades as well as sell item like treasures to. Such weapons include pistols, magnums, snipers, smg, shotguns and grenades (explosive, flames and flash). Ammo is not sold by the merchant, so you need to preserve what little you have and scavenge the area for more. It is highly recommended that you only stick to upgrdaing 2-3 weapons as it is impossible to accumulate enough money to upgrade them all. Like many resident evil games, you have an inventory that is used to store items like weapons, attatchments, ammo and herbs. You have limited space, which can be expanded via upgrades. At the end of the level a cutscene will play signalling the end of one level in the chapter and the begining of another. I completed the campaign in about 18-20 hours, but there is plenty of replayability here with new difficulties and playing with only certain weapons (as well as newly unlocked ones). Completing the campaign unlocks a new difficulty, new weapons, new costumes, raid mode, theatre mode, the mini game :""Assignment Ada"" as well as the expansion 'Seperate Ways'. One of the negative points I found with the game (especially with 5) were the quick time events. Such events occur so quickly that it is difficult to press the correct keys on time, which usually results in death (especially during cutscenes) or taking alot of damage. At on point in the game I was forced to lower the FPS to 30, in order for my 'button mashes' to register in game. Such events I found detracted the game, and ruined the overall flow of gameplay. What was further frustrating was that the key inputs would be randomised so it is difficult to predict which were the right keys to press until it was too late.AudioThe sound is great. Weapons sound powerful. Voice acting ranges from decent to bad. Leon's voice as well as a few characters are decent. While ashley's voice is irritating. Music is played when enemies are present in the area and only turns off when all enemies are defeated. This feature is indicates when you should be vigilant or relaxed.ControlsControls are passable. The game uses tank controls, meaning that you can't move and shoot at the same time. It is much more clunky than resident evil 5,rev and 6. You can switch the mouse control schemes to original or modern, which affects how fast you aim with the mouse. movement is slower than resi 5,rev and 6, however this is compensated by the fact that enemies are much slower than later entries in the series.GraphicsThe graphics range between decent to subpar. The HD release improved some of the textures in the game, such as some trees. However, other textures were left untouched. Furthermore, the character textures have been improved slightly and are less rigid. You can choose to switch beteen the HD and old graphics at any time. There are also a few colour filters available from the get go, which change the look and feel of the game. Overall, I found the graphics worster than rei 5,rev and 6.ExtrasBesides the main campaign there is also: Mecenaries, Assignment Ada and Seperate ways. If you are unfamiliar with resident evil, mecenraies is a mod first introduced in resident evil 3. You select from a range of characters which each have a unique loadout of weapons and equipment. The aim is to survive against waves of enemies until the timer reaches zero, whereby you get extracted to safety. Each map hold a variety of crates, herbs, ammo etc which can be collected. You start with only one character selectable (Leon), with new characters unlocked when you earn enough stars in each stage. Compared with resi 5 and 6, there is only a limited number of characters and stages available. Furthermore, unlike later entries, you can't play this mode with a friend (ie no co-op)Assignment ADA is basically a mini game unlocked after completing the main game. You play as ADA (obviously), in a non-canon story whereby you are tasked to collect virus samples located in the area. Unlike the the main game and seperate ways, there are no save points in this game mode so you have to complete it in one run. This also forces the player to conserve ammo and look for herbs to keep in the fight. There are enemies in each area that you have to take out. At the end of the mode, you will face a boss. Completing this mode also unlocks a new weapon in Seperate Ways. Should you die, you will have to start from the very begining of the mode.Seperate ways is basically an expansion, where by you look into Ada's motives in the main game. You play as Ada Wong (resi 2), a Chinese American agent, working for a secretive organisation, tasked with retrieving a sample of the virus. The levels are set during the main game, showing how she came to be in the main game. You start with a set of weapons, which have already bean leveled up a bit. Unlike Assignment Ada, you can save the game by accessing type writers. You can also buy weapons and gear from the merchant, but you are unable to upgrade weapons. It is shorter than the campaign and yet longer than Assignment Ada. Completing this mode will unlock new costumes and weapons in the main campaign as well as cutscenes to view in theatre.Final ThoughtsIf you want are a resident evil fan or want a good action game with more horror elements than what resi 5 and 6 had to offer and don't mind, quick time events and old control schemes, then resident evil 4 is right up your alley.

												The first pc version of Resident Evil 4 was quite flawed and lazy but thankfully Capcom turned things around in 2014 with a remastered version featuring sharper graphics and full keyboard/ mouse support. As Leon you'll be tasked with rescuing the president's daughter from a group of fanatics and you'll soon realize things are way darker than you've expected.While showing its age in places and strying somewhat far from the slow burn horror of its predecessors RE4 is a great game finally given a worthy port.PROS:-good sound design and soundtrack-great atmosphere-a pretty straightforward and less cheesy story that works quite well-the infected villagers and other bioweapons you'll encounter are a breath of fresh air from the usual zombies and'll require new strategies-great boss battles-the game is more action oriented than the previous ones thus providing an enjoyable and challenging experience where you are often pitted against many enemies: you'll need to strategize-great length, expect at least 14 hours (plus extra modes after you complete the game if you're so inclined)NEUTRAL:-the standard RE cheesy dialogues clash a bit too much with the serious tone of the story-while the graphical update is welcome it's a bit of a mixed bag, character and monster models are pretty nice but most textures aren't too sharp-puzzles are very simple, I'm personally fine with it but some might miss the more complex ones found in previous episodes-sections where you have to babysit the presiden't daughter can be a bit annoying CONS:-cramped camera-controls feel a bit sluggish overall and betray the game's age-instadeath quicktime events during cutscenes are just annoying-a couple of quicktime events are extremely buggy if the game is set at 60fps, they're almost impossible to pull off and you'll have to quit the game (losing about 10 minutes of progress if it happens in the mine cart section) and set it to a slightly nauseating 30fps to pass them


resident evil 4 / biohazard 4 
A Screenshot of resident evil 4 / biohazard 4
By: stranger1982




Resident Evil 4 abandons the old fixed camera shots and most of the sense of dread in favour of an over-the shoulder camera and tense fights that often pit you against many enemies able to use tools such as weapons, shields or objects in the environment: it's a big change, one that not only provides a fresh experience but that also influenced the next games both in plot and gameplay.It works, and it works quite well even though it's not as innovative as it was when it first came out: in fact the somewhat clunky controls and cramped camera will possibly make modern players turn up their noses. It must be said that as awkward as they might be at times old design choices like being rooted on the spot when aiming and having a limited turn radius do evoke a genuine sense of dread when you're faced with several enemies scrambling from different directions or simply need to target a bioweapon's vulnerable spot while trying to not be shredded to bits.My only complains are the annoying quicktime events during cutscenes, they add little to nothing and are just frustrating when you miss them and have to watch the cutscene all over again. Even worse are two unsolved bugs where Leon fails to climb on ledges if the game is set to 60fps: the biggest culprit here is the mine cart section where the previous save point is 10 to 15 minutes beforehand. Having to quit the game to set it to 30fps and then having to start over to pass the bugged QTE was not fun at all and is a bug that'd have been solved.Even with a few niggling issues Resident Evil 4 is a great game in the series and the last remaster finally gives us a worthy port to enjoy on PC: it's a definite purchase for fans of the genre, maybe just read beforehand on the two bugged QTEs to avoid any annoyances.

												Ahh this game was great back in the old days, still is to this very day actually, the port isn't THAT bad at all, which is really weird, but I shall explain.PROS:Framerate/HD version: Yup this game is now even MORE high res than the PS3 and 360 versions, and to cap it all off you can pick the settings to 30 frames or 60 frames, why you would put it on 30 is beyond me though.Nothing has changed: From what I can see nothing has really changed, then again I didn't get THAT far in the console version, since the Wii is utter s%$t, and the aiming on that console was terrible, especially the castle level.Inventory: You can get a HUGE inventory in this game, and I love it, although at times it's like a game of damned tetris since you have to move everything around where you want it/want more space, and the fact you have to pause the game to get your gun out each time, it's not annoying though, nice for a second of relaxation.Ashley: I may or may not get hate from this, but Ashley is the ONLY AI character I enjoy having, mainly because you can hide the b#$ch in a dumpster and she won't leave until you say so, nice since you don't have to worry about her all that much.Keybindings: When I played this I was a little scared cause I didn't know what the key bindings would be, but they are kind of simple really, except for some button pressing sequences anyway, those can be a hassel 1-2 times.The Beginning of the end: What I mean by this, is that this game was the point of ALL Resident Evils, and after this they dropped pretty damn quickly, cause 5 you had annoying sheva and the GOD AWFUL inventory system, Yes Sheva I know i'm hurt and I see that you care, but seriously, I ONLY LOST A PEG OF HEALTH DONT BE SO DAMN MOTHERLY.  And don't get me started on 6 or Racoon City, cause Racoon city was just terrible, and 6 was a little better but still awful.Ammo and health: When I started this I got a HUGE ammount of ammo and health, and I thought ""Man I wonder if I should have put this on a harder difficulty..."" Then later I barely had any ammo left and a crapton of healing items, seriously RE4 you could be a LITTLE more forgiving, yes I know the enemies drop stuff but it's mainly money, give me some damn ammo or something.Bosses: Some of the bosses are a total challenge to fight and some are just really simple, like the lake monster you fight all you have to do is avoid him running you into trees and just start throwing spears at him the whole time, don't even have to waste ammo.The ""Merchant"": I still don't know why this guy is here, or why i'm buying/selling stuff from/to him, but atleast he's not a a$$hole or anything, but DONT KILL HIM, or you won't be able to buy/sell anything ever again for the whole game, but the one thing I REALLY hate is that he doesn't sell ammo or grenades, WHY?! When I go to his big shops I can SEE ammo and such in the back behind him, what, is he hoarding it or something?Block doors/windows: In certain areas like the town you can block the doors or windows with bookshelves and dressers that are nearby, it's nice to barricade a part of the room, atleast for a bit till they end up breaking it down, that way you don't have to worry as much.CONS:Mouse aiming: The aiming with the mouse is a little weird, but it's not bad, it's a little slow behind you're actual movement but i'm sure if they would have made it like a actual aiming mouse it would have made the game WAY too easy, so i'm glad they didn't change it.Ammo: Ammo ends up being VERY scarce later on in the game, I recommend trying to keep ammo of a certain type on you at all times and using other guns instead, I made the mistake of wasting some on downed enemies when I should have knifed them.Knife: Yes it is useful for breaking barrels and crates but I never really used this thing other than that, I did start using it later when I was low on ammo, I would shotgun the guys down, run over there, and just start knifing them, actually did more than what I thought it would, I wish they would have made the knife abit more obvious or maybe something that got peoples attention, cause I rarely use it.Dogs: THESE mother f#$kers are the most annoying enemy out there, if they jump on you they can take a good 1/4 or 1/2 of your health away in just one pounce, REALLY?! I like challenge but when a enemy is heavily overpowered it gets really tedious to fight them.Some bosses: Some bosses are a total D$#k half the time, later you have to fight these 2 giants in a boiler looking room, you can make one fall into the lava to die so you will only have one left, the problem? If you get too close to the edge of the one that fell in the f#$ker grabs you and pulls you in with him, one time I was in there and made the guy fall in, then I went around the edge, he popped OUT OF THE LAVA and pulled me in, seriously?  Hell a button pressing sequence would have been PERFECT there.No subtitles: There is a option but it's not accessible, which is really annoying, there may or may not be a fix for this, it's just a little thing I hate, I like to read what they are going to say most of the time.The god damned Rail sequence: At one point you go into a tomb and have to ride a railcar to get to the other end where this key is at, now enemies can drop into the carts with you, but you can shoot them off before you get to them and make them fall, but it's a total b#$ch to hit them, and even the quick time sequence at the end killed me about 5 times, I am glad I don't have to deal with that again.WHAT I THINK: I think that CAPCOM had actually done something good apart from the other hideous Resident Evil games that have been made, i'm looking at you 5 and 6, and you too racoon city.  I am really glad they brought this to PC, because I loved this game so much back in the day and I still love it to this very day, it's one of the actual good games that is still entertaining.Out of all it gets a good 8/10, there are some things that still annoy me but once you get past them atleast you don't have to worry about it again, unless you decide to do another playthrough.Is this worth it on it's current price? YES. On a sale? YES.			"

												This was the 1st resident evil in which it changed the series and the game play. There are some puzzles but there nothing like the puzzles you have saw on resident evil 1,2, and 3. The new experience is amazing. Its less scary unless a zombie comes out of nowhere. The new port for resident evil had a bad start but at the end it now works. I enjoyed the gameplay, even though I own the original game on pc which ubsoft did. Once you beat the game you get 3 other game modes. This prob adds about 2-3 hours worth of gameplay depending how you are.MercenariesOperation AdaSeparate ways "

												Resident Evil 4 is a ground-breaking title in the Resident Evil franchise. For some, it might have made the series a bit worse, for diverting from it's survival horror roots and more. However, I disagree on that idea. For while RE5 and RE6 might have gone far from it's roots, RE4 at least still has it's parallels to keep intact with the preceeding titles. Survival horror changes it's gears to action horror in this installment, although it retains a lot of the original Resident Evil flavour - typewriters and odd puzzles remaining in the core. RE4 is a great title. This new PC edition is a godsend for it's HD abilities, and the fact that it overwrites the previous PC port that was god awful. I loved this game ever since I first played it. If you haven't bought the game yet, then buy it! It's not as outlandish as 5 and 6, instead having a nice charm to it's somewhat cheesy nature with our hero Leon. Stuff to keep in mind is the fact that subtitles aren't available for English players, albeit it seems the other versions of RE4 didn't have English subtitles either way. Also, this could just be me but, while this game has a decent 60fps lock on it, the game often slows down. The frame rate drops to about 40-50, and everything acts like Bullet Time from Max Payne is enabled. It does go away though. What's up with that? I'm sure it's just a problem on my part though.  In the end, RE4's new HD PC port is worthwhile to get. As the time of writing, it's on sale! For an astounding $6, no less. Cop it as soon as possible!			"

												What need be said? Resident Evil 4 came out in 2005 on the Gamecube, and eventually landed on PS2, XBOX 360, Wii, probably PS3 and original XBOX as well. Now, it's been released on Steam 9 years later, and it's selling like hot cakes for a reason. This is the FIRST Resident Evil game I ever played, and I originally didn't want to bother with it. ""What? No zombies? Screw that, sounds lame, it's not even FPS!"" I said, but my good friend told me ""Nah man, you have to try it. I know what you mean, but here I am, RE2 is my favourite in the series, but I still love RE4 as well!"" So I tried it, and of course, it has become one of my all time favourite games. I've since played the first Resident Evil, Code: Veronica, Outbreak File 1 and 2, RE5... and that sixth one... ugh... and well, RE4 is my favourite, with RE5 probably coming 2nd, and the original at 3rd. I'm sure if I played through the RE2, it'd probably come in at 3rd or maybe even beat RE5 for 2nd.It's truly unfortunate that RE5 has become more of a 3rd person action game rather than a survival horror, and RE6 was just... blegh... HOW DO YOU SCREW UP ZOMBIES?! Anyways, I find RE4 still retains much of the survival horror that the more recent releases are lacking. It has a decent amount of firearms (Not as many as RE5, but there is still a nice selection), I love the inventory system even if it is outright unrealistic, and the characters are very well rounded. Voice acting, atmosphere, good puzzles, the only things I can say that I hate about the game is some of the Quick Time Events. Also, some of the firearms in the game don't shoot the ammo that is given, however that can be overlooked.I do like to pay extra attention to realism in games, however RE4 is so much fun, I easily look past the few unrealistic qualities it has. Even if you're a diehard FPS gamer like I am, even if you're really anal about realism like I am, even if you think RE5 and RE6 are leading to the death of the series (IMO, RE5 was saved by the co-op gameplay, interesting inventory system and selection of firearms, however RE6 is outright disappointing), I believe you will still find some fun in RE4 if you haven't yet tried it out. The replayability is amazing, there's LOTS of stuff to unlock, and there is most certainly a challenge if that's what you're looking for. Especially when you unlock Professional mode. There are many memorable scenes, characters that you will genuinely become interested in and come to love or hate, and there are a multitude of ways in which you can approach a situation instead of just go in and start shooting.Oh yeah, in this rendition of RE4, they really went all out with how the game looks. If you have a high-end computer, you can have 60 frames per second, and HD quality visuals. I have a tower that's about a year old and doens't have anything special in it, so I had to bring it back down to 30 frames per second (You can change it in Options on the main menu), and I also turned off the Anti-Aliasing... which I'm not gonna lie, I have no idea what it does in the first place. All I know is when I tried to play it at max settings, the game was basically stuck in slow-mo. Quite annoying. I just turned down some of the graphical options, and it runs almost perfectly :) ... wow, 4 paragraphs. Sorry for typing so much, I hope this helped you decide whether to pick the game up or not. In the end, I can't think of very many reasons NOT to get it lol Like I said, the replayability is there, and if you want to unlock everything, you'll get over 40 hours worth, minimum. Like I said, there's challenge there if you want it, but if you're more casual and just want to experience the story, or if you're just not used to the unique controls of Resident Evil, then easy mode will be a good way to get past the learning curve without too much hastle. Have fun!			"

Away with the irrational fan-love. Bring the real love which is more productive even if they don't listen. When Resident Evil had a real name, the fourth installment made it clear to gaming that survival can only be made with a good map, some life organizer inventory, ultra-violence and tension leaving you scared sh*tless and a interesting plot to back it all up. On PS2 glory days, graphics were already good but with those HI-Res textures, RE4 just got some rightful restorative treatment. It isn't a revival or something, the zombies were only sent to some nice relaxing spa. They still angry though, the feeling to have many half-smart zombies (which is scarier than the full ret@rded ones) coming so slowly close to you, the darkness all around... it all still leaves a heavily armed ex-cop feeling like a girlie about to get r@ped in the woods - its all stills there. It's still hard, it still mature. Stills ultra-violent.For my incredible surprise, it is still scary enough too. The plot was simple at first, but complex through it and full of interesting turning-points like every Biohazard before that. Never played it? Don't think twice. You will have some problems with the joystick on the gameplay, but they implemented some variations on the options. You just need to explore that until you feel confortable with it and start tweaking from there. This is the last great Resident Evil and I used to be a fan. But if Capcom now thinks that I'm going to love anything thrown at my face just because it bares ""Resident"" on its title, they must think I'm a b*tch and I'm not. Specially when they spell it wrong. Resident Evil Revelaitions anyone? That's sad.			"

												Really good game i played total 30 hours and am not disappointed . Although its old (i played this game back to 2005 on my ps2..)  i believe that the most important thing of every game is the gameplay and  some other elements (story etc.) ..and of course in these is perfectly made with a nice story, good atmosphere , fast action gameplay ,creeping moments and monsters ,nice characters etc. But... i found the graphics  pretty good for an hd remake, i think that they could be better. But lets be fair ...the game is old..and so the engine of the game is hard to make it to look like 2016 or 2015 graphics on the same engine that they used back to 2005 ...Concluding anyone should play this game and shouldnt be missed this .. thank you for your time			"

												Easily one of the best video games ever! I've played through it about 5 times now on different platforms. Even though it aged a little bit, it's still funny and thrilling to play this survival horror masterpiece! Some negative aspects to be mentioned about this version...""Ultimate HD Edition"": The Texture resolution could be a lot higher, character models are fine but in sequences, you can see some relicts of the lower power of the consoles which this game was orignally made for. When there are like 20 villagers, about 80% of them are a lot less detailed (look at screenshot 4 of 19). No idea why they couldn't fix this. They re-recorded the scenes but Capcom didn't care that it might hurt the atmosphere not to fix this. I would really like to know, if they will fix this for the XBO/PS4 release.The controls:I played this game on Gamecube, PS2 and PS3 before so I was pretty excited to see, if Capcom installed good Keyboard+Mouse controls. I thought it would make the game a lot easier.I can just say: if you haven't played this game before, then it will feel extremely odd overall, because it's still using the same mechanics which let you move like a tank. It's a bit more precise than a controller, but I'm using a X360 controller anyway (maybe it's just because I'm used to it... :D) because the controls were obviously made for gamepads - you can feel that.

												A TECHNICAL MESS! DO NOT CONSIDER PURCHASING UNTIL IT IS PATCHED!!! Resident Evil 4 is a great game. Arguably one of the most infamous games ever released and the best in the RE series. This port is even crappier then the original PC Port. YEAH, it's THAT bad! :/Massive slowdown, graphical glitches, FMV cutscenes don't work for me. This is a massive letdown.Even with all settings turned down to low and running the game in 800/600 resolution, the game runs like crap on my computer. Don't even get me started on the supposed requirements to run the game in it's HD resolution. Laptop users need not apply. The game is simply NOT optimized for PC yet, and clearly was designed a console game anyway.Though I understand that the game may run better on other hardware then on my PC, it would seem that many other users on the Steam community are experiencing similar problems. Even top of the line CPU's and graphics cards seem to struggle with this game. It's poorly optimized and very demanding, having supposedly been developed with the Crysis 3 engine.Should Capcom release a patch and fix it up, I might be able to recommend it. However, unless a major patch is released, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME on STEAM!PLEASE CAPCOM! FIX THIS GAME!!!			"

												Resident Evil 4 makes for an enjoyable survival horror title which really reinvented the Resident Evil genre. The game keeps you on your feet as you make your way through rural Spain as you try to secure the daughter of the President of the United States. Although at its toughest times, it may seem like a glorified escort mission (which you will think, in time), it fights this through responsive gunplay, secrets and more. The only turn off for some is the tank controls for Leon, which you do eventually get used to as you play through the title. I give Resident Evil 4 a 9/10			"

												Oh the nostalgia! But let me be quite honest in this review, Resident Evil 4 is a game that revolutionized survival horror and will provide you with hours of fun. If I may dare to make an analogy, the average price for a movie ticket to a 2 hour showtime at night is about 15 USD, and if you want concessions add about 20 USD on top of that. Add together the 2 hours of entertainment, 3 hours for the quality of the entertainment, and 5 hours if you went with friends or family or someone special and continued the night after the movie. That's a wopping 10 hours of cummulative entertainment. At the time of this review I have logged 33 hours on this game for a total price of 20 USD. If you have never played RE4 before, buying this game would be treating yourself to hours of entertainment in the survival horror genre. If you played this game on Gamecube or PS2, or even the older 2007 ""revamped"" PC format (I'm dreadfully sorry if you did because you practically wasted your money if you weren't involved in the modding community) than this new HD version won't exactly blow your mind; but, there is still major benefit to purchasing the game. The HD textures are very much noticeable during combat and overall gameplay. The characters look amazing, the explosions and bullets look wonderful, and the merchant's blue torches have never looked creepier. The updated smoothness to your FPS makes movements and actions seamless and much more realistic. I really have enjoyed this game thoroughly and have no doubts in my mind that I will continue to play despite clearing the main campaign three times so far and the subcampaigns once each. I highly recommend purchasing Resident Evil 4 to anyone who is a fan of the survival horror genre.			"

												What can I say, its Resident Evil 4, a classic for those that owned Gamecube and PS2. Now the game is exactly the same way it was on the consoles, including all the extras such as: Seperate Ways, Assignment Ada, and Mercanaries. Although the game claims to be Ultimate HD, its really not. The textures are improved for sure, and the gameplay is at 60 FPS which is amazing, BUT because of the age of the game there is only so much that Capcom can do without re-making Resident Evil 4. As for those that claim the game is a bad port because of crappy mouse + keyboard controls, they are just idiots that never played RE4 on the Gamecube or PS2. This game was designed with ""tank controls"" in mind, meaning that the camera DOES NOT CONTROL Leon's movement in any way. You do not use the mouse to turn Leon while holding down W to move forward. This is how the original game was designed, and for PC gamers this may take some time to get use to it, since we intuitively use our mouse to turn our characters ingame. The mouse is just used for aiming while in ""aim mode"". All-in-all this is a great port, and I highly recommend this game for all Resident Evil franchise lovers, or anyone in general that enjoys this genre.			"

												If you played this game back when it was released almost a decade ago you get pretty much the same experience again, but as that's what I was looking for I'm really happy with it. If you use a controller you may need to play around with the pre-set layouts until you find one you’re happy with but otherwise it plays as you would expect it to. Well worth the price even if it’s just for the nostalgia value.If you never played RE4 before but are a fan of the series it’s well worth the purchase to see Leon and Ashley’s story.  "

												Steam's UHD Version of Resident Evil 4 was ported to PC from the XBox 360 version.Not going to talk about the game itself because you know it very well. I'll just make some comments on the UHD version for Steam, in case your thinking to buy it:1 - HD TexturesThe Village textures looks pretty much HD, but we can´t say the same for the rest of the game.Some ""Casstle"" textures (just a few) and a lot of textures from ""The Island"" chapter, look like the SD versions. Besides, weapon's textures are pretty awfull (that's what bothers me most :P).2 - 60 FpsSome animations (like rifle and bowgun reloads) were not ported to 60fps. Also some animations like ganado's exploding heads, etc.Sometimes, 60 fps brake the game (it's VERY RARE tough). Sometimes it makes enemies run in circles and stuff like that.Falling objects drop at double speed (U3's cages, spinels, etc). This is a minor detail, but it's not very neat.Besides all the ""downsides"", playing the game in 60 fps is awesome. And a Feature of this version only.3 - Mouse & Keyboard support.After 6 game patches, controls work great.4 - Vissual FXNothing to critisize in this aspect. Altough the GC version is still superior (DOF, multiple screen filters, etc), the UHD port is VERY decent (everything important was included).5 - Real Time cutscenesCutscenes are real-time, except the ones of ""Separate Ways"" mode and ""ESPECIAL 2"" custome in the main campaing (since this costume wasn't included in the GC version of the game).6 - System requirementsThey are quite HIGH for a 10 year old game. I own a Phenom II X4 955 with a HD Radeon 6870, and I have to disable AA in order to run the game at 60 fps and 1080p.Also played it at 60 fps 800x600 on a Nvidia 8600GT videocard.Conclusion?Very good port (FAR better than the 2007 one) but it still needs polish. Not better than the GC, but pretty close, with the addition of HD textures (65% of them), 60 fps, and of course: the K&M support (this alone makes it worth for any PC user)The game is super FUN.Hope my review will be usefull to you.Regards.

												Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games ever made.  It rejuvenated the series as it was slowly becoming stagnant.  RE4 didn't kill the series because it was bad but rather because it was so good any further sequel would be worse no matter what.  It's a flawless mix of survival, horror, action, a pinch of puzzle solving and a huge amount of camp.  I love that this game doesn't take itself seriously like 99% of games these days.  RE4 practically invented the set piece action sequences seen in most modern games but it also features plenty of ""meat n' potatoes"" gameplay in between the set pieces.  The environments are incredibly varied and it's simply a blast from beginning to end.  Perhaps controversial are the QTE's.  While I don't particularly enjoy QTE's I can appreciate their usage in RE4 for heightening tension and not going overboard with them as some games do.  I could go on and on, but these are all points shared across all versions of the game.  The most important thing this PC re-release provides is mostly functional 60fps support.  Playing this at 60fps is a revelation; there is absolutely no going back.  It's so much easier on the eyes and plays much better.  Aiming is smoother, even with a controller.  I've been gaming on a 120hz monitor for a few years now and even though the game is capped at 60fps it feels smoother than most games do at 60fps.  I think because the animations are keyed to the framerate is why it appears this way.  For example, Wolfenstein: TNO feels downright choppy at 60fps whereas this is absolutely butter smooth.  Mouse and keyboard support is present but not quite as good as I'd hoped for.  The mouse is a tad wonky even with the ""modern"" aim setting.  It feels like there is a slight amount of dampening but at least it seems as though the negative acceleration is gone.  It supports key rebinding but the defaults were just fine IMO.  Overall, M+KB is definitely usable but not necessarily ideal.  For a game like this, it really was intended to be played with a controller and it plays very well with a 360 pad.  If you're a huge fan of RE4 like myself, you need this version for the 60fps alone.  Sure it has some minor bugs and glitches but it's still by far the very best vanilla version of RE4 available and it'll only get better with further modding.  I wish this had had a higher budget internally at Capcom.  I'd gladly have paid a full $60 for a flawless re-release of RE4 with a more moderate graphical overhaul, perfect M+KB controls, no bugs or quirks, etc.  RE4 really deserves better than these budget re-releases Capcom's been doing, but overall it's hard to complain.  This release feels 90% finished for $20 which is still much, much, much better than the craptastic Sourcenext original PC release.			"

												Resident Evil 4 has been one of my favorite games since its release back in 2005 on the gamecube. It is back with all of the extra content from versions after, and looks better than ever.  I do wish it came with less bugs though I cant seem to get the audio working correctly since patch 1,06 added positional audio. Switching to beta 1.02 works but then you lose bump mapping and specular lighting. Kind of inecusable especially since this was the 2nd try on the PC.			"

												I bought this game for GameCube back when it first came out. I've also owned it on PS2 and now through Steam on PC. All-in-all, I can tell you that this is a very good game - the fact that I've bought it 3 times should tell you something. This is by far my favorite of the Resident Evil series games, after playing all of them, minus Code Veronica. The story is very well thought through and to back it up, it takes a solid 12-15 hours of gameplay for a seasoned player that knows all of the tricks in the game. There are 3 main areas in the game, starting in a Village, progressing to a Castle, then onto an Island. (Each takes several hours to complete.) This has always been among my favorite games ever since i first played it 7+ years ago, which is why i was thrilled as hell to see it remastered and put onto a PC version. Controls are easy to configure/get used to wrether you're using a controller or the keyboard/mouse. If you're not new to this game, but worried that the remastering of this game changed it too much - don't be. There have been zero glitches so far for me and the graphics didn't really change that much tbh, other than removing some pixel blur here and there, which adds up for a better visual experience. It's just as I always remembered it when I was a little kid that dumped his birthday money on this game for the GameCube. Overall, I would gladly go out of my way to recommend this game. It has great replay value, due to higher difficulties, game-modes, and bonus weapons/costumes unlocked through beating it in each difficulty. A solid 9/10 from me overall - even in today's standards. Well worth every penny, and long enough to justify $20. To be honest, I'm surprised that Steam didn't charge more due to it's remastered version.			"

												Oh my gosh. I'm just going to gush about Resident Evil 4 for a bit. This game is my favourite of ALL TOYME.First time I played this game was on the Wii many years ago. I had never played a Resident Evil game and didnt play many third person shooters, let alone horror games. I had only seen a few Youtube videos about the game and that was enough for me to want to try and play it. And oh my Gosh this game is perfect. Its atmospheric, the designs of everything is so eerie and creepy, the action is great, the learning curve is perfect, the puzzles aren't too difficult, the bosses OH THE BOSSES ARE SO COOL. THERES A GUY WHO GROWS REALLY TALL AND GOES RAWR AND THE ROOM IS ON FIRE AND ITS SO CRAMP AND ITS SCARY! Now as for controls its a bit of a different story. The keyboard and mouse are just fine, though playing with a controller is a bit wonky since its a very early TPS game of its kind. But its very easy to get a hang of. The inventory system is perfect how you can organize it and rearrange your items so you can hold what you want! The story is very simple, and you could probably say thats a drawback but I dont think of it as such. Its easy to follow and the voice acting, while cheesy, is cheesy enough that its enjoyable to listen to (except for Ashley). Just... just buy this game is perfect.10/10.. 100/100.  Best game, best game.  "

												Before reading this understand - I played through my Gamecube version over 20 times and the Wii Version twice. I KNOW THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND. I'm mainly putting some quick thoughts down for those who haven't played it or played an older version.Ok, obviously the games good. Worth the cost if you haven't played it or want to go through again. It still holds up fantastically, The PC version has all the extras from the GC and PS2 editions which is a nice little plus. Keyboard and mouse controls are kinda gross, and Quicktime events can screw you over on an xbox controller because there is a glitch where it shows the keys to press instead of the controller buttons.This is the pinnacle of the Resident Evil Series - creepy but not too scary, controls great (with a controller at least), hard but not impossible, and chock full of little secrets. A few too many QTE's but most of them aren't troubling. If for some reason you don't have a copy of this game, you need to get it. It's worth every single cent. For some reason I had a little more trouble noticing items on the PC version but that may be an issue with my monitor. I cannot find any outstanding issues with the port over to PC.The story is great, every part is memorable and noteworthy and you can feel the meticulous planning and love that went into every detail of the game. You don't need a super strong PC to run it smoothly so unless you're running an ancient rig or still have an other version to play GET THIS VERSION AND PLAY THROUGH IT ALREADY.			"

												I bought this game for GameCube back when it first came out. I've also owned it on PS2 and now through Steam on PC. All-in-all, I can tell you that this is a very good game - the fact that I've bought it 3 times should tell you something. This is by far my favorite of the Resident Evil series games, after playing all of them, minus Code Veronica. The story is very well thought through and to back it up, it takes a solid 12-15 hours of gameplay for a seasoned player that knows all of the tricks in the game. There are 3 main areas in the game, starting in a Village, progressing to a Castle, then onto an Island. (Each takes several hours to complete.) This has always been among my favorite games ever since i first played it 7+ years ago, which is why i was thrilled as hell to see it remastered and put onto a PC version. Controls are easy to configure/get used to wrether you're using a controller or the keyboard/mouse. If you're not new to this game, but worried that the remastering of this game changed it too much - don't be. There have been zero glitches so far for me and the graphics didn't really change that much tbh, other than removing some pixel blur here and there, which adds up for a better visual experience. It's just as I always remembered it when I was a little kid that dumped his birthday money on this game for the GameCube. Overall, I would gladly go out of my way to recommend this game. It has great replay value, due to higher difficulties, game-modes, and bonus weapons/costumes unlocked through beating it in each difficulty. A solid 9/10 from me overall - even in today's standards. Well worth every penny, and long enough to justify $20. To be honest, I'm surprised that Steam didn't charge more due to it's remastered version.			"

												Resident Evil 4 has been one of my favorite games since its release back in 2005 on the gamecube. It is back with all of the extra content from versions after, and looks better than ever.  I do wish it came with less bugs though I cant seem to get the audio working correctly since patch 1,06 added positional audio. Switching to beta 1.02 works but then you lose bump mapping and specular lighting. Kind of inecusable especially since this was the 2nd try on the PC.			"

												There isn’t much to be said about Resident Evil 4 that hasn’t already been beaten into the ground. All these years later it is still one of the most lovingly detailed, polished, and meticulously put together games of all time. Easily Mikami’s best work and undeniably the game that shifted the paradigm of horror games for years following its release (for better or worse). What is lacking in horror is made up for in tense encounters that encourage quick take downs and efficient use of supplies. The story is pure ham - even by Resident Evil standards. The series may be known for jumping the shark, but Resident Evil 4 takes it to new lengths. A Napoleonic little person, bizarre cults, a giant automaton, and cringe worthy one-liners are just part of what awaits the player. It is all good fun, however, and the game seems as if would be far less without its off kilter humor as well as personality.Resident Evil 4 itself is a lengthy game, the main story alone shames most anything that comes to mind in terms of variety and content. In addition two scenarios featuring series regular, Ada, as well as the much loved Mercenaries mode round out the offerings, if that was not enough the game offers a slew of unlockables. Even at full price the value proposition is excellent.The PC version itself feels a bit perfunctory. That said it runs at just any resolution one would expect at a rock solid 60 FPS. In addition the game supports the Xbox 360/One controller without issue. This version of the game is easily a far cry from the original PC port. This reviewer personally experienced no issues with the game. A must have for any fan of the genre or even third person action games in general. Highly recommended.			"

												Although I definitely recommend this game, as it is a classic, I have a few issues that are bugging the hell out of me.I used to own this for the Gamecube, and a lot of the ""HD"" textures seem half done, or not changed at all compared to their low-res counterparts. Leon's jacket seems hardly different. I've seen much better, higher res textures developed independently and available for free download (the Epsilon/Darkplaces mod for Quake 1 comes to mind).Also, they bound actions to X rather than A, without enough customization to swap the two. This left me with a rather confused thumb, since even newer console games have you pressing A to pick things up. And though I am proficient in games with WASD controls, keyboard and mouse are not an option for a game like this, regardless of customization. They should have let you set individual buttons for both keyboard and controller. It's nothing I can't get used to, but it's still very inconvenient. If you're new to RE4, then you probably might have a better relationship to the controls. But if you're a veteran, beware of missed button presses.Though it is indeed a HUGE step up from the initial PC release from 2005, it's still very lacking for a ""remastered"" game. They could have done so much better like they did with the more recent RE1 remaster.I almost want to say it isn't worth the 20 bucks I spent on it. This game is a classic and deserves better. But as a fan, I still think people should buy it because it's full of action and awesome gameplay (with the exception of escorting Ashley, the annoying little twerp).			"

												I highly recomends this port, now that months past away, the game recieved a lot of official fixes and some community fixes. you can find to downlaod in the communty tab, wich are a few and awsome.the game now looks, like never before ,with the restored, mised effects, in one moment when the game launched, lacked from some visual effects,, but now restored, looks even superior ,than the gamcube version, and thanks to the www.re4hd.com ,you can download for free, and upgarde to HD trough an enviromental pack, from all the village section, of the game ,wich the textures this guys are making the game looks incredible and sharper mainting the same textures and colors capcom did. Putting the same pictures ,that capcom used,  when they maked the game in 2004.A game, that change the resident evil formula forever ,from estactic cameras, to third person camera shoulder, with horror elements, this game will keep you electrified, and tense trough al the long campaing, shooting ganados surviving monsters and traps, amazing and creppy atmosphere, all to rescue the sutpid president daughter, but if you are a new comer fon resident evil games this games and like dead space or alan wake or evil within among other you cant miss the first who changed all. it resemble to much games now, because many developers took resident evil 4 like a parameter to design the new games from 2004 and late Sois a classic to me so i give it a great note and will recommend this to anyone.9.8/10			"

												Good ol' Resident Evil 4, the game that introduced me to this great series and now available on Steam. For the first time ever, you can play this game at 60 fps, which is fantastic. Want to know what esle is fantastic? The fact that this game has all the content from the PS2 and Wii  versions further adding more replayability and gameplay hours. You'd be finding yourself playing these little modes like Mercenary mode and trying to survive the onslaught or you'll be playing the story for the 20th time in a row on higher difficulty. It's important to note, however, that though this game is considered Survival Horror, it is not exactly scary... well, safe for the first encounters with the Regenerators that is. But old school Resident evil fans might not get the scares they look for when playing a Resident Evil game. Regardless, its solid gameplay is more than enough to make this game a great purchase and the amount of content you have access after beating the game increases its value in general. Highly recommend!			"

												This game is weird, maybe I'm infected with ALL the praise this game have received, everywhere they review 2000 and NGC and PS2 games RE4 was mentioned. I haven't been able to stop playing, I've been spending weekends playing at 1:00 am , and even daydream about playing this game which I haven't felt since last Call Of Duty Black Ops, for which I stayed till 3AM playing.The biggest downside about this game it's the controlls are really DULL and weird to play,  that they left the old controls scheme, you can't walk and enjoy the scenery like many FPS and over the shoulder games have made standard. You can only walk bacwards and forwards and turn with the same joystick, awfull to play and I was about to quit playing at the first hour. I try to understand this since I played all resident evil before up to RE3 which was the last release on PC. I try to understand they tried to keep this old RE gameplay, and I try really hard, but this is a remake, controll should have been imporoved.Anyhow graphics are really neat, you can even read all the details on a grenade.Also I liked the fact they use a fanservice version, I read back when RE4 was released they added an animation when you try to look under asahley's skirt when she is on the roof or top of ladder, and japanese version didn't added that animation of ashley' screaming and covering her skirt			"

												Resident Evil 4 makes for an enjoyable survival horror title which really reinvented the Resident Evil genre. The game keeps you on your feet as you make your way through rural Spain as you try to secure the daughter of the President of the United States. Although at its toughest times, it may seem like a glorified escort mission (which you will think, in time), it fights this through responsive gunplay, secrets and more. The only turn off for some is the tank controls for Leon, which you do eventually get used to as you play through the title. I give Resident Evil 4 a 9/10			"

												(Quick verdict at the bottom)Score: 4/5Resident Evil 4 is actually the fifth game in the main series, and definitely the most popular. Critics and gamers alike heap praise on this title like there's no tomorrow, and you can't blame them, because the game really is incredible. And although it's set some questionable trends, like the hideous and cheap quick-time event, or the genre shift from horror to action that it's successors unjustly receive criticism for, the game holds up incredibly well today. Thus it should be no surprise that it has been released on basically every platform in one way or another; this one is the second PC version. We're talking about Capcom here, people! The master milkers! This review will be mostly a comparison between the original (abysmal) 2007 PC port and this re-release.Graphically, this game isn't a remake but an HD overhaul, so don't expect it to be amazing. The new textures look great in comparison to the old ones, but still kind of washed out and muddy. Animations are exactly the same, but no complaint there, as they're extremely fluid and, well, kick♥♥♥♥♥ There's a new lighting engine and it looks good, but still not great. Far better than the original 2007 release though. There's also a variety of video options to tweak, which, while standard, weren't there for the original, so it's a nice addition. 60fps looks great if your PC can handle it, but the option to stay at 30fps is still there for lower-end machines. I've heard complaints about how the game runs, but I haven't run into anything major so far, so I assume they've patched a couple of things. Monster design is unique and some of the best in the series, for sure. Regeneradors/Iron Maidens still scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me, and they look even worse now in HD. Menus are crisp and finally the cutscenes are in real-time, which is so much better than those eyesore FMVs in the 2007 version.Sound-wise, it holds up well. Being the middle point for the series, the voice acting sort of follows suit; it's like halfway between a B-movie (from Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 and Code: Veronica) and a Hollywood blockbuster (Resident Evil 5, Revelations and 6). Still camp, but in a good way. Music is phenomenal, very appropriate and moody depending on your circumstance in the game. Enemies sound chilling (again, the Regeneradors scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me) and just damn cool a lot of the time. The bosses especially provide some traditional Resident Evil-style mutations. I do have an issue here though; every now and then the game will just stop playing all sounds, only for them to all play at once after a couple of seconds. It doesn't happen often but it is kind of annoying nonetheless.Story: typical Resident Evil. As in, it's just all over the place and weird. Kind of a mixed bag. One thing I never liked about the plot in Resident Evil 4 is how radically different it is from its predecessors. If you ignore the fact that Wesker, Ada and references to Umbrella's downfall are in the game, it really doesn't have anything to do with previous entries. It's pretty much entirely self-sufficient. The fact that the gameplay changes radically as well further alienates it from the earlier games. But the story has never really been a drawing point for me in this series, and it's not too complicated and gets the job done, despite some cliches here and there. Leon S. Kennedy, from Resident Evil 2, is tasked with rescuing the President's daughter, who's been kidnapped in rural Spain. He interacts with a cast of mostly interesting characters, there's a couple of plot twists, and there's some nice political stuff thrown in.The gameplay is where this game shines, and it's easy to see why it's renowned as a classic and one of the best games of all time. Gone are the fixed camera angles, pre-rendered backgrounds, solving puzzles, zombies, and avoiding enemies. Resident Evil 4 is pure action, but this isn't a bad thing, because it's done so well. Setting the trend for basically all future third-person shooters, Resident Evil 4 is played in an over-the-shoulder view from Leon's perspective. Tank controls are far less restricting when the camera moves with you, and aiming is now free, allowing for precision, which you'll definitely need. Enemies react incredibly well depending on where you shoot them, or what type they are. No, you can't move and shoot, but you get used to it quickly (especially if you've played the earlier games).In the place of zombies are Ganados (Spanish for ""cattle""), humans who have been injected with a parasite which makes them all hive-minded servants, hell-bent on slicing you open with a scythe, or rake, or hatchet, or kitchen knife, or chainsaw. Shoot them in the arm and they'll drop their weapon. Shoot them in the leg and they'll drop to their knees, allowing you to perform a crowd-clearing and oh-so-satisfying kick to the head. They're relentless, smart and they greatly outnumber you, and they're always getting stronger and more intelligent, which keeps them from being boring and keeps you on your toes. Their human qualities and behavior makes them all the more creepy too. And there's far more than just Ganados, too. There's tons of different enemies to kill, all requiring different tactics and weapons.Weapons are now acquired (mostly) from a travelling Merchant, who is simply the greatest Resident Evil character of all time. Not really, but he's cool. You can also upgrade weapons, find and sell treasures for more money. Your inventory is now an attache case with a grid-based spacing system, meaning items such as herbs take up a mere two slots, whereas rocket launchers take up a huge a mount of space. You can rotate items to allow for more space, or throw stuff away. Pretty much everything is upgradeable, and the sense of progression is really, really satisfying.Resident Evil 4 is also perhaps the only game in existence to have an escort mission that is actually ENJOYABLE. For about half of the game you have to escort Ashley Graham, the President's daughter, to safety. If she dies or gets captured, Game Over. Thankfully, her AI is actually pretty good, and the fact that you can tell her to stop and hide rather than having to constantly be on the lookout makes the game much less of a hassle.It controls well, although they definitely haven't aged as well as everything else. This port allows for much greater compatibility, either with a 360 controller or keyboard and mouse. Nothing astounding, but when you consider that the original 2007 release miraculously didn't have mouse support, it's a nice touch. And there's a slew of extras after completing the game. Tons of content to unlock, to keep you going. Sure, there isn't anything new in this version that you haven't seen since the original came out, but at least it's all there!If there's one bad thing I can say about this release, it's the fact that it's basically a giant middle-finger to the awesome modding community of the original 2007 version. The people here: http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evil_4_PC/index.php?showforum=10 made what was one of the worst ports in history into one of the best through their hard work and dedication. I'm assuming Capcom either saw what they transformed this game into, or given that it's easier to port nowadays and that there's already a PS3/360 HD version available, decided that they'd just re-release it for some quick cash. However, there is a new modding community for the HD re-release, and if it picks up even a quarter as much as the original community, I'll be really impressed. After all, I did support Capcom and their money-grubbing ways by buying it again.Verdict: Buy it if you haven't played it before or in a long time. It's definitely the best version. Otherwise, stick with whatever release you currently have. There's nothing new here. But that ain't a bad thing!			"

												Resident evil 4 is a sequel that changed this franchise for worse, however this is a really good game. The story is that the president’s daughter: Ashley graham is kidnapped and held in a rural town somewhere in Europe, most likely somewhere in Spain where everyone is infected with the plagas virus which involves and an evil cult who wants to take over the world. The story starts off trying to be grim, disturbing and serious than halfway through the game the story decides to become completely ridiculous and not take itself seriously. The gameplay is a significant change from the previous games: you now have a third person over shoulder view point with precision aiming though you still control like a tank, (moving forward and backwards but turning left and right) there are a lot more enemies this time round and they are basically piñatas and drop health items, ammo and money, there’s a currency system where you can by weapons and upgrades from a merchant and you can also sell treasure to the merchant, your inventory system is now a suit case with a grid and all of your times are now represented as diagrams varying in size from the smallest being an egg and the largest being a shotgun or a sniper rifle, typewriters are much more common now and you can use them how many times you want now instead of having limited saves on ink ribbons, you also have quite a varied enemy roster from snakes, to your standard human enemies, to the heavies, giant bugs, dogs and the infamous man with a chainsaw aka Jason Voorhees from part 2, and the gameplay itself usually shifts and changes quite a lot. There are still boss fights and puzzles but for the most part this is a third person shooter more than anything. Oh yeah and you have to escort Ashley for half of the game. The things I don’t like about this game are:The quick time events. Sometimes you’ll just be watching a cut scene than all of a sudden QUICK TIME EVENT and then you die and have to watch the cut scene over and over because you weren’t quick enough the first time it the buttons to press change each time. Ashley graham: one you have to escort her for half of the game which is bad enough (luckily if there’s a dumpster you can just throw her into it and clear the area first) but also she’s really annoying, how many times did you want to twist her head of her shoulders every time she says: “LEEEEOOONNN, HAAAAAAAAALLLPPPP!!!” “HALP ME LEON!!” and every time she screams…ughh… Even when you’ve upgraded the handguns its random of how many shots it takes to blow someone’s head off. This game can be quite frustrating at times but it’s not all that bad. (Resident evil 5 gets the crown for being the most frustrating and annoying) But for the most part this is a fun game to play, it’s the only third person resident evil game that I would say is definitely worth playing.

 Simply a masterpiece.  Nominated for the ""Test of Time"" award for the Steam Awards. There's a reason people call Resident Evil 4 one of the greatest games of all time, because it really is. Capcom took a big risk by transfering the Resi series to the 3rd person perspective, and my god did it pay off. Limited ammo and supplies, puzzle solving, many horror elements and a overall great story. It's still survival horror, it can still get scary, it's still fun and it's still Resident Evil.Easily deserves a 10/10. I'm not over exaggerating, it seriously deserves it. This game is THAT good. I recommend it to every gamer out there that, for whatever reason, hasn't played this game yet.			"

												This game is still as amazing as it was before, on the gamecube. The only thing is, this takes a better computer to run than i thought it would, which did stagger me a bit. Besides the whole ""30fps drop when reloading the rifle"" and the fact that i have no idea where to get my pre-order bonuses, i love it like i always have.			"

												One of the most undderated titles of all time. Resident Evil 4 is one of the best resident evil games ever made and the first resident evil game I ever played. The controls are great and responsive and the story is cheesy as all get out but entertaining and actually can be genuinly scary at times. A great game for people who are new to horror video games and are just looking for a fun experience.			"

The port has like 1 or 2 issues but the game is great. If you have a decent system you shouldn't have to worry at all.Don't just stand there, BUY IT!I've beaten the game three times already.			"

												An HD remake of one of the greatest games I've ever played. The graphics look pretty good and the lighting is much improved over the vanilla 2007 version. The HD textures of the unmodded game however cannot match the image quality of the modded HD textures of the 2007 version. So the most signifcant improvement is the 60fps (if your PC can handle it though)M&K controls are awesome once you get used to them, and if you don't mind to adjust them manually till you find your best settings. The Mouse control  is very responsive and the aiming is very smooth. Those who suffer from Mouse responsiveness issues I suggest them to adjust the sensitivety as the default setting is very slow. One of the downsides of this version is that it requires a hefty CPU to run at 60fps -(you need at least a CPU that is based on Nehalem architecture from Intel (First gen Core i5s/ i7s) or a K10 CPU from AMD (Phenom IIs)  to have 60 fps)-. However it is not hard on any high-end or mid-range graphics card that has released 5 years ago or later.I played the game on 3 cards and all of them managed to get constant 60fps at 1920x1080 8x MSAA and all settings on High : GTX 470, HD 7950 and GTX 780 Ti.I highly recommend this game, I give it a 9/10.

												Dead lord does this game have a terrible PC port. First of all when I start the game its in slow motion! I tried changing some of the options like resolution, motion blur, etc, but its not that. Its a bug which needs to be patched up. I've tried looking up how to fix this which I did, which is lowering the FPS but for some reason it wont allow it and it just pretty much doesnt exist. I cant put subtitles on just like FPS and hd mode, and the dialogue in the cutscenes isnt matched up with the animation. Dont buy game unless using a controller or reading this review, becuase it does not work! Waste of $10.			"

Resident Evil 4 is the game that changed Resident Evil and set a new benchmark for a new world of action/horror games.It may be hard to appreciate now, but when this game was released, it was revolutionary. If you liked Resident Evil 5 and 6, then you'll feel right at home with 4. However, if you're a purist (As in, the only ""real"" resident evil games are those before 4) then you may need to ignore the title ""Resident Evil"" as this game is totally different to what you're used to.I'm so glad this game came to PC, I enjoyed playing it on the PS2 and likewise on the Wii. However, I feel as though the controls are pretty weird.The game runs super smoothly and I haven't discovered any bugs, yet.			"

												Used to play this game on Ps2. Its a good port to PC, mouse sensitivity is little slow at start but after increase on options its good. Mouse+keyboard controls are great. Quick time events can be fast at start but not imposible,im doing every one flawless. Suffers from slow-mo from time to time,but fixes after entering inventory and exiting. Pros: Great Gameplay         Variety of enemys         Great selection of guns each with diferent stats         Guns can be upgraded for better preformance and each gun has one uniqe upgrade         Great mix of action and survival horror          New Game+         Additional content after when you finish the main story Cons:Ashly............

And AGAIN!Then I purchased the 360 version and finished that numerous times. After building my gaming PC recently I decided to purchase my 1st game on Steam- Resident Evil 4 HD edition! In glorious HD AND 60 FPS! This is easily the best version of the greatest game ever created. If you haven't played it yet, please go ahead and purchase this ground breaking masterpiece of a game. It's worth 100 times the asking price, and more!This game gets my highest recommendation possible!			"

												It's fame preceeds it, its a very engaging action game with a side of horror, or at least jumpscares.The story is very engaging, I always found myself playing overtime just to see what happens next, and even though it has many cliché moments, it manages to add an original spin to it, and it isn't afraid of making a bad joke in the middle of a disaster; it's like the characters where actors of a movie, and from time to time they just took a break from their roles.The gameplay is sturdy and heavy, meant for you to walk carefully in case there's an ambush ahead (and there will be many), even shooting is heavy to control and will demand skill from you more than just a big weapon most times. There's quick time events all over the place, and even when sometimes they feel unfairly quick, they reflect the context of the characters requiring to think fast while under pressure.The environment is wonderful, it builds up with all horror game details to get the spooky atmosphere that will tense you up at times, and even when left in complete silence, it still transmits anxiety for the player of what comes ahead.Most fans of light horror and/or action will recommend this game, and it's not a frequent top game of all time for no reason... despite of what Capcom has made with the franchise over the years			"

												Without a doubt one of the greatest games ever created, if not the greatest depending on your tastes.You could beat this game several times and discover new secrets, strategies, ways of being more conservative and efficient, cutscenes, etc.It certainly is the most thought out game I ever played and the amount of different playstyles that are possible depending on your loadout and knowledge of the game is more than you would ever think for a third person shooter.It also has quite deep combat mechanics for a shooting game, probably the deepest of it's genre.If only more action games could be this be open ended and fun. While still being replayable and providing interesting and immersive atmosphere.If you haven't played this game yet and consider yourself a gamer you are missing a massively important title to your repertoire.

For my full review, read the article I wrote here: BlazeKick.com review[blazekick.com]Resident Evil 4 is probably one of the most recognized and renowned survival horror games in history. With this in mind, I've actually never played it very much at all. I jumped on the opportunity to play this game on PC in what they called the ""definitive version."" I was not disappointed.Returning fans will enjoy the updated graphics, though they should not expect current-gen graphics. Most of the textures are mainly just given a spit-polish; this is to compensate for current computer specs (like widescreen support and higher resolutions). The options allow you to choose between the original graphics and the new HD graphics, improved motion blur, various post-processing shaders, etc.The gameplay, in all directions, have been left alone. Don't fix what isn't broken, right? The PC controls feel very fluid, and players that prefer using a controller will feel just fine with the Xbox controls, as well. Other controllers (like a PS3 controller being emulated through MotionInJoy) are also responsive, although the buttons are just listed as their designated numbers.You can upgrade and buy your weapons at the merchant, play a little shooting range mini-game for some cash, and various other quirky things that make this game feel like it legitimately progresses. I didn't feel any slow moments after the beginning; they constantly threw new things at me and I loved every minute of it.Nothing in the game has been streamlined; this includes the Ashley sequences. Don't get me wrong, I understand that everyone has their preferences, but I don't understand the hate behind the escort sections. They were fine to me, but that's just me, I suppose.The level design is incredible. With an open-world dynamic to each region, players can explore to their heart's content. The game features few branching paths, but a few extra things that require various things to access, like Ashley.The sound is updated to fit a higher quality standard. Not much worth of noting here, but potential buyers should be warned that the sound can desync from the video at times.Overall, the game gets a ""must-buy"" from me. For $20 USD, players get a game with an incredible amount of replay value and extra content.			"

												What can I say, its Resident Evil 4, a classic for those that owned Gamecube and PS2. Now the game is exactly the same way it was on the consoles, including all the extras such as: Seperate Ways, Assignment Ada, and Mercanaries. Although the game claims to be Ultimate HD, its really not. The textures are improved for sure, and the gameplay is at 60 FPS which is amazing, BUT because of the age of the game there is only so much that Capcom can do without re-making Resident Evil 4. As for those that claim the game is a bad port because of crappy mouse + keyboard controls, they are just idiots that never played RE4 on the Gamecube or PS2. This game was designed with ""tank controls"" in mind, meaning that the camera DOES NOT CONTROL Leon's movement in any way. You do not use the mouse to turn Leon while holding down W to move forward. This is how the original game was designed, and for PC gamers this may take some time to get use to it, since we intuitively use our mouse to turn our characters ingame. The mouse is just used for aiming while in ""aim mode"". All-in-all this is a great port, and I highly recommend this game for all Resident Evil franchise lovers, or anyone in general that enjoys this genre.			"

												If you played this game back when it was released almost a decade ago you get pretty much the same experience again, but as that's what I was looking for I'm really happy with it. If you use a controller you may need to play around with the pre-set layouts until you find one you’re happy with but otherwise it plays as you would expect it to. Well worth the price even if it’s just for the nostalgia value.If you never played RE4 before but are a fan of the series it’s well worth the purchase to see Leon and Ashley’s story.  "

												Oh the nostalgia! But let me be quite honest in this review, Resident Evil 4 is a game that revolutionized survival horror and will provide you with hours of fun. If I may dare to make an analogy, the average price for a movie ticket to a 2 hour showtime at night is about 15 USD, and if you want concessions add about 20 USD on top of that. Add together the 2 hours of entertainment, 3 hours for the quality of the entertainment, and 5 hours if you went with friends or family or someone special and continued the night after the movie. That's a wopping 10 hours of cummulative entertainment. At the time of this review I have logged 33 hours on this game for a total price of 20 USD. If you have never played RE4 before, buying this game would be treating yourself to hours of entertainment in the survival horror genre. If you played this game on Gamecube or PS2, or even the older 2007 ""revamped"" PC format (I'm dreadfully sorry if you did because you practically wasted your money if you weren't involved in the modding community) than this new HD version won't exactly blow your mind; but, there is still major benefit to purchasing the game. The HD textures are very much noticeable during combat and overall gameplay. The characters look amazing, the explosions and bullets look wonderful, and the merchant's blue torches have never looked creepier. The updated smoothness to your FPS makes movements and actions seamless and much more realistic. I really have enjoyed this game thoroughly and have no doubts in my mind that I will continue to play despite clearing the main campaign three times so far and the subcampaigns once each. I highly recommend purchasing Resident Evil 4 to anyone who is a fan of the survival horror genre.			"

												In my opinion, the best version of Resident Evil 4 from all the versions I have played. I played the PS3 version years back and couldn't get on with the aiming, found it rather sluggish and using the left stick is a NO NO for me. Using K+M I'm a lot more comfortable with on a game most say is made for a controller which I find very ironic. Compared to the recent 're-release on the PS4 too, this just blows it out of the water. Performance is the most solid, no visual hiccups, controls perfect. Playing this 1920x1080, 60FPS is just amazing for a game that's over a decade long. Leon remains as hot as ever ;)			"

												It's truly nice to play in 60 fps, the changes in textures are also a nice touch but many old textures remain as well as some bugs, however it's still the Resident Evil 4 we loved many years ago and I'm very satisfied. I only wanted to have a better videocard to play smoothly the 60 fps fixed promised as it seems to drop and causes slow motion when you use a lowe end video card.  After all Resident Evil 4 is one of the games that no matter how many times you have played, if you play again you're still gonna have fun.			"

												One of the greatest games the franchise has ever seen, Resident Evil 4 has been one of my most beloved games throughout my history of playing it on Gamecube, Ps2, Xbox 360, and now even PC. I'm not sure what it is about the game, but it is one of the few games that I find more and more entertaining each time I play a new game plus or try on the hardest difficulty. Pros:-Cheesy but loveable voice acting and characters-Leon is actually cool (Unlike RE6's Leon)-Gunplay is extremely fun and satisfying-Replay value is infinite-Fun little extra gamemodes to play (Seperate ways, Assignment Ada)-A healthy number of guns to try and to upgrade-An inventory system OCD people will adore-Bosses that are challenging though they may lack in combat creativity-Some puzzles that are a bit challenging -Enemies stay tough enough to provide a challenge and they appear with new weapons and ""boss"" enemiesCons:-PC ""Biohazard"" may still be slow when there are a lot of particles to display (Like a LOT of explosions or an excessive amount of any effect displayed) especially with the last boss fight.-As I said in Pro's, bosses are kind of easy to beat once you get the hang of things-May be times when you are helpless to a horde of enemies with flails that hit you infinitly and kill you-""HELP ME LEON""Overall:-This game has followed me through several systems and I still play it relentlessly today, maybe it's just me, but I can't help but love the life out of this game, and I reccomend it if you're looking for a RE game that isn't all horror or all action as the franchise has been lately, it has a perfect blend of each. Everything about the game feels well balanced and purely entertaining and I hope you consider it.			"

												Used to play this game on Ps2. Its a good port to PC, mouse sensitivity is little slow at start but after increase on options its good. Mouse+keyboard controls are great. Quick time events can be fast at start but not imposible,im doing every one flawless. Suffers from slow-mo from time to time,but fixes after entering inventory and exiting. Pros: Great Gameplay         Variety of enemys         Great selection of guns each with diferent stats         Guns can be upgraded for better preformance and each gun has one uniqe upgrade         Great mix of action and survival horror          New Game+         Additional content after when you finish the main story Cons:Ashly............

Resident Evil 4 is the game that changed Resident Evil and set a new benchmark for a new world of action/horror games.It may be hard to appreciate now, but when this game was released, it was revolutionary. If you liked Resident Evil 5 and 6, then you'll feel right at home with 4. However, if you're a purist (As in, the only ""real"" resident evil games are those before 4) then you may need to ignore the title ""Resident Evil"" as this game is totally different to what you're used to.I'm so glad this game came to PC, I enjoyed playing it on the PS2 and likewise on the Wii. However, I feel as though the controls are pretty weird.The game runs super smoothly and I haven't discovered any bugs, yet.			"

												The game is made to be fun and is set in a spooky atmosphere. If you took the dirty, spooky, gross atmosphere out of this game it would still be fun unlike almost every horror game ever, which is why it's so replayable. Not to mention the 3 bonus missions (DLC expansions circa 2005) you get after beating the game and the three unlockable outfits you can get. I'd be okay spending $70 on this, unlike most games today this game is actually worth the money.			"

Quick Breakdown: A remastered version of Capcom’s 2005 horror classic. At times a slow paced survival game, punctuated with bursts of more frenetic third person shooter action.Length: 20-25 (Main game), 30+ (Main + extras)Genre: Survival Horror / Third Person Shooter / ActionScore: 8.5/10Review Date: 2016-07-04Full Review: Having not initially played this game until almost a decade after its release, it’s more difficult for me to fully grasp the impact it originally had on the industry, and while I’d love to go in depth with that, I’m just not familiar enough with those details. Instead we’ll focus on what we have here, which is a game that is still fantastic to play, even for the first time.You play as Leon Kennedy, as US government agent sent to rescue the President’s daughter from a crazed cult in Spain. While doing so, he uncovers a more sinister plot involving a mind controlling parasite known as Las Plagas. It’s a pretty decent story, and more than enough to keep things interesting.On to the meat of RE4: the gameplay, and it’s solid. The controls are a little bit dated, utilizing tank controls, in which your character turns left and right instead of strafing, and the mouse aims without changing the camera angle. It took some getting used to, but probably 2 or 3 hours of gameplay, but it was worth it in the end. While I certainly prefer more modern controls, they at least works for the game.The game starts off very slow paced, very much a survival horror game in its early stages, having to scrounge around for weapons, health, and ammo, and just barely managing to scrap by. Resources eventually become a more easily manageable thing in the later game, once it transitions to be more action heavy. That’s not to say you can ever stop worrying and just coast without thinking of supplies, especially since you have to play inventory tetris. You have a limited amount of carrying space, represented by a grid, which each item taking up one or more grid spaces, and in various shapes representing the item itself. It’s not the perfect system, and it has its drawbacks, but at the same time it has a charm to it that does add a unique element to the game, while managing to benefit the survival element of the game.The game has a good horror atmosphere, featuring unsettling environments, and a host of interesting enemies, from crazed villagers, horrible beasts, parasitic lifeforms, and religious fanatics. The bosses in the game are massive, colossal behemoths, grotesquely deformed parasites, and a hell of a lot of fun to fight.Some of the game seems to draw a lot of inspiration from John Carpenter’s The Thing, which given that it’s one of my favourite movies ever, is certainly a good thing. This can be seen in some of the enemies (Las Plagas seems to borrow some inspiration), and especially a level in the later part of the game set in a frozen laboratory (which also calls to mind the original The Thing From Another World from 1951). Possibly I’m drawing more connections between the two given that I greatly enjoy each, but it’s nonetheless something that I can’t help but notice and chalk up as a positive.If there’s any downside to the gameplay that jumps out, it’s the quick time events, which add little-to-nothing, and are sometimes frustrating. There’s even a QTE or two where some people had to turn down their graphic settings, else they’re impossible to pass. I don’t remember if I personally had this problem, but I know my brother did, and he played on a machine similar to mine. For reference, one of them was the QTE at the end of an action filled mine cart passage (which in itself was a lot of fun), but the QTE involved rapid button mashing.The game itself looks beautiful, the remastered graphics manage to really bring out the environments and enemies. I haven’t played any of the previous versions of the game, but from what I’ve read poking around online, this is the best version to play if you’re new to the game. If you’ve already played the game before, there’s no need to play through this again just because it’s been remastered, unless of course you simply want to play it again since it’s a great game. (Something I myself intend to do at some point).The main game itself will take you around 20 or so hours to finish the main campaign; though I think I took a bit longer than that myself, adjusting to the controls, and exploring everything. (Not that I got 100% or anything). There are a few bonuses that you manage to unlock by finishing the campaign, a pair of mini-campaigns where you play as Ada Wong, which will take about an hour or two each, and are a fun romp.There’s also a mini-game, called The Mercenaries, in which you can play as 5 different characters (4 of which must be unlocked), and your aim is to earn as high a score as possible before the time runs out. Points are earned by killing enemies, with combos and boss enemies rewarding more points. It’ll help kill at least an hour or so just dicking around, and it’s decent fun.If you’re a fan of horror games, especially survival horror mixed with action, this is a must play. Otherwise, it might not do much for you, but it’s worth at least a try if it piques your interest.			"

												Resident Evil 4 is the (much beloved) black sheep of the Resident Evil series. While still maintaining the classic tank control scheme from a new perspective, Resi4 takes the prerendered action adventure series and turns it into an arcade action game. While the over the shoulder camera angle and setpiece levels lends itself as a more cinematic adventure, Resi4 is a thoroughly mechanically focused game and uses its tight and limited camera angle to create a claustrophobic survival thriller experience which no other game has managed to successfully replicate, including Capcom's own later efforts. If there is any grand flaw in this game, it's that Capcom explored the gameplay experiences this sort of 3rd person combat could provide so definitively in this one game that ironically it sort of refutes the need for another game to follow up on what this game provided. My only hangup is how mediocre this port is. I was almost ready to give this game the thumbs down because I was struggling to make this port work at all. Resi4 was never optimized to run at 60 fps, and that sadly remains true of this port. I ended up playing the game at 30 fps in order for it to be playable. This might be the only pc game in which anyone would recommend playing at 30 fps over 60, but there are other reasons besides optimization. It's clear that this game was designed to be played at the 30 fps mark, with mechanics, play speed and animation timing all built around a locked 30 fps. This isn't so much a failing of Resi4 or Capcom, but more a testament to how thoroughly this game was built to run for the system it was originally made for. There is nothing wrong with building a game around the limitations of the hardware it was meant for, many classic console games were made for the purposes of playing well on their native console. But it also means that when straight ports such as this one are made that they risk turning off die hard pc fans who refuse to drop below 60. If it's any consolation, this game plays very well at 30, and is one of the few pc games I'd ever play in which I was happy to play at 30 fps. This thumbs up is for how great Resi4 is to this day, despite the quality of this port and not because of it.			"

												Parts haven't aged as well as I thought, but you can't deny the games charm after all these years, or the effect its had on other horror and action games since its release. The item management is still satisfying and the keyboard & mouse controls are fine. The whole castle section though, pretty much the middle of the game just doesn't hold up. From the parasite knights to the lava temple and rollercoaster carts, it all just feels out of place and nearly soils the game for me. Its a shame considering how good everything around it is but I think antiquated descirbes it best.			"

												The best looking and smoothest RE4 you'll find. Textures have been improved a bit, looking almost as good as L4D2's, The keyboard and mouse controls come 2nd best to the Wii version. If you've beaten RE4 a long time ago and want to revisit it, THIS is the one to play. If you're new to it, don't judge it harshly. The controls are like a tank (old school) and the graphics still have a 2005 vibe to them but much much cleaner than before. If you haven't played any RE game before, this one is good to start with as it doesn't have zombies from earlier in the series, instead has a different plague. As of now, the game needs patch for some small issues, and a big one that's not in the main story mode. That shouldn't stop you from buying it. It's an excellent survival horror/action. Something I should note, the game's speed is tied to the frames-per-second (like an emulator). There are 2 FPS settings: 30 and 60. If you can't keep a steady 60, try 30. If you can't keep a steady 30, give up. lol.			"

Doesn't detract from the experience though.  Worth all of your $20, can't pass it up on a sale!			"

												An HD remake of one of the greatest games I've ever played. The graphics look pretty good and the lighting is much improved over the vanilla 2007 version. The HD textures of the unmodded game however cannot match the image quality of the modded HD textures of the 2007 version. So the most signifcant improvement is the 60fps (if your PC can handle it though)M&K controls are awesome once you get used to them, and if you don't mind to adjust them manually till you find your best settings. The Mouse control  is very responsive and the aiming is very smooth. Those who suffer from Mouse responsiveness issues I suggest them to adjust the sensitivety as the default setting is very slow. One of the downsides of this version is that it requires a hefty CPU to run at 60fps -(you need at least a CPU that is based on Nehalem architecture from Intel (First gen Core i5s/ i7s) or a K10 CPU from AMD (Phenom IIs)  to have 60 fps)-. However it is not hard on any high-end or mid-range graphics card that has released 5 years ago or later.I played the game on 3 cards and all of them managed to get constant 60fps at 1920x1080 8x MSAA and all settings on High : GTX 470, HD 7950 and GTX 780 Ti.I highly recommend this game, I give it a 9/10.

												It's fame preceeds it, its a very engaging action game with a side of horror, or at least jumpscares.The story is very engaging, I always found myself playing overtime just to see what happens next, and even though it has many cliché moments, it manages to add an original spin to it, and it isn't afraid of making a bad joke in the middle of a disaster; it's like the characters where actors of a movie, and from time to time they just took a break from their roles.The gameplay is sturdy and heavy, meant for you to walk carefully in case there's an ambush ahead (and there will be many), even shooting is heavy to control and will demand skill from you more than just a big weapon most times. There's quick time events all over the place, and even when sometimes they feel unfairly quick, they reflect the context of the characters requiring to think fast while under pressure.The environment is wonderful, it builds up with all horror game details to get the spooky atmosphere that will tense you up at times, and even when left in complete silence, it still transmits anxiety for the player of what comes ahead.Most fans of light horror and/or action will recommend this game, and it's not a frequent top game of all time for no reason... despite of what Capcom has made with the franchise over the years			"

 Simply a masterpiece.  Nominated for the ""Test of Time"" award for the Steam Awards. There's a reason people call Resident Evil 4 one of the greatest games of all time, because it really is. Capcom took a big risk by transfering the Resi series to the 3rd person perspective, and my god did it pay off. Limited ammo and supplies, puzzle solving, many horror elements and a overall great story. It's still survival horror, it can still get scary, it's still fun and it's still Resident Evil.Easily deserves a 10/10. I'm not over exaggerating, it seriously deserves it. This game is THAT good. I recommend it to every gamer out there that, for whatever reason, hasn't played this game yet.			"

												One of the most undderated titles of all time. Resident Evil 4 is one of the best resident evil games ever made and the first resident evil game I ever played. The controls are great and responsive and the story is cheesy as all get out but entertaining and actually can be genuinly scary at times. A great game for people who are new to horror video games and are just looking for a fun experience.			"

Resident Evil 4 is the game that changed Resident Evil and set a new benchmark for a new world of action/horror games.It may be hard to appreciate now, but when this game was released, it was revolutionary. If you liked Resident Evil 5 and 6, then you'll feel right at home with 4. However, if you're a purist (As in, the only ""real"" resident evil games are those before 4) then you may need to ignore the title ""Resident Evil"" as this game is totally different to what you're used to.I'm so glad this game came to PC, I enjoyed playing it on the PS2 and likewise on the Wii. However, I feel as though the controls are pretty weird.The game runs super smoothly and I haven't discovered any bugs, yet.			"

												Used to play this game on Ps2. Its a good port to PC, mouse sensitivity is little slow at start but after increase on options its good. Mouse+keyboard controls are great. Quick time events can be fast at start but not imposible,im doing every one flawless. Suffers from slow-mo from time to time,but fixes after entering inventory and exiting. Pros: Great Gameplay         Variety of enemys         Great selection of guns each with diferent stats         Guns can be upgraded for better preformance and each gun has one uniqe upgrade         Great mix of action and survival horror          New Game+         Additional content after when you finish the main story Cons:Ashly............

												Resident Evil 4 is different from the early entries of the franchise and it becomes quite ridiculous in the castle area, but the gameplay, after all these years, still remains some of the most fun I've played in a shooter (or any game for that matter). The Remaster has poor textures, but the character models look pretty good and the fact that you can play this fantastic game in 1080p is reason enough to warrant a purchase.			"

In glorious HD AND 60 FPS! This is easily the best version of the greatest game ever created. If you haven't played it yet, please go ahead and purchase this ground breaking masterpiece of a game. It's worth 100 times the asking price, and more!This game gets my highest recommendation possible!			"

												Resident Evil 4 is the best game ever. I mean that. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpeice. Every setpeice puts a first time player on edge with effective scares, scenery and  atmosphere. I've completed this game around 14 times, give or take. I spent many restless hours piddling through this game when it first came out. I was young at the time, and I never played anything like it. It was indescribably captivating. As a veteran now, even my proffesional playthroughs are pieces of cake that run like clockwork, but that first fluid playthrough as a kid playing on my friends gamecube eating junk food and shivering in fear was a perfect gamin experience. What a wouldn't give for the feeling of the tingling of my knuckles and the drop in my stomach I felt  the first time I saw Dr. Salvador. The game is comprised into three acts like a movie. The first consisting of Leon's forray into the parasite infested forrests of Madrid, the second into a mansion landscape with bizarre cultists around every corner, and the final a makeshift industrial complex where Umbrella tests on the Spain denisans. Each room  or area is memorable in an unbelievable way. After playing through once or twice you could do it with your eyes closed. This inspired a genre of the uninspired. But what it has over other 3rd person cover shooters at the time is that it's great, a masterpiece. For any gamer it's a practically mandatory experience. I've bought it on every console it's came out on. Do yourself a favor and buy it. (just be sure to set the game to 30 FPS due to the speed bugs caused by 60 FPS.)			"

												I never played the original Resident Evils but I enjoyed the story on this one. It wasn't so much as ""zombies"" but another form of control. The movement was kind of off but the combat was satisfying. You will have to play through this a few times to get all the weapons and upgrades. Their is even a way to play Ada on various missions.I tried out the other extra mini games and wasn't a fan. You just have to keep killing people and finding hour glasses to increase your time. I guess it would be fun if you have nothing else to do with your time. Overall I think the look and feel of the game was good for it's time.+Graphics+Sound+Bossses-Movement+Combat+Story+Level Design9/10After playing I fear for real life If I ever get parasite in my body.. will stock up on cleansers.

												I love this game! So much nostalgia..I played this game when it first came out, and playing it over again, it has stood up to the test of time. It's not perfect, but I do think this is a must try for anyone..Though the controls don't translate well to PC, and most people have to turn the graphics down to cut back on slow down, it's still a fun game. The ""HD"" graphics aren't amazing, even with all the settings up, but personally I don't care about that. There are mods to fix that, I think anyway..Oh, and I know it's not really a good thing, but for players who aren't the greatest at this sort of thing, considering the way you aim..a bit of slowdown can help a bit, if you don't mind being slightly slugish. Anyway, the point of all this is that Resident Evil 4 is an amazing game. Maybe even the best, though Resident Evil 1 was pretty good too..The only thing I think that could surpass this would be RE7..check that out too if you have yet to see it. [Oh, and if you have the option, the port on the Wii is the best out of all the ports, in my opinion anyway..The aiming is much easier in that one]			"

												Resident Evil 4 is a fun game that has much to offer. I think the best part of Resident Evil 4 (as well as other Resident Evils) it the inventory management. Personally I am addicted to upgrading and buying new weapons and that made me search every area up and down to scratch by with the latest purchase from the merchant. It's also great when you're almost out of ammo and surrounded by enemies to offer that fleeting experience. Admittedly it does lose that survival aspect half way through the game and becomes more action oriented, but that just makes it better.			"

												A very fun and probably one of the greatest Resident Evil games that was ever developed with all things considered with the later games. The game was the first to change up the formula from the old camra angles that remained stationary, that many games afterwards would reproduce, thinking that was what made te series scarey, but often doing it really bad compared to Resident Evil.With this one it changes to a 3rd person perspective with the camra following close behind so you don't realise an enemy is behind you until it's too late and the upgrades to the weapons can make some of the weakest weapons, the best in the entire game.The story itself has some great cheese to it, which makes it a lot of fun with interesting antagonists to engage in and Leon Kennedy being quite a fun character too in the entire thing with his unsubtle way of hitting on women and making many quips against his enemies before he finally faces them.What's most fun is the unlockable weapons from completeing the game, completeing the additional game content such as Operation Ada and Seporate ways, both starring Ada Wong who you meet in the game and you play as her with her grapplying hook, replacing the need for a second character to help piggyback over areas.It's a really fun game and when playing alone can get quite creepy with the new enemy who aren't zombies, but are possessed with little to no free will of their own.

												First of all, let me just start by saying this game is amazing and should never be forgotten since it was a vital part of the shaping of the seventh generation of console shooters. Many of the aspects this game introduced or perfected from previous use have become a staple of pretty much every third person shooter that came out after 2005. While Gears of War may have pushed other games to have these features, RE4 was the one who brought them into the survival horror action esq genre.So I came into this game with mediocre expectations from hearing what others had to say about the modern Resident Evil games. They all said that 4 killed the series, and I though it killed it in a bad way. That's not the case. RE4 was the creative peak for the Resident Evil franchise. This game is the most self aware game I've ever played and is proud of it. I can see the game designers in an office saying to themselves how they want their main character to not react to anything, even when it's a F*CKING WALL OF FLESH BLOCKING YOUR ONE WAY OF ESCAPE! Anyway, the way this game killed the franchise was not a bad way. 4 is like the oddball of the Resident Evil franchise. It doesn't fit into the classic RE games, and it doesn't fit into the crappy modern ones. It found a balance between action and survival horror attempting to pease everyone. And it actually did! I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of this game. It appeals to fans of the series as well as newcomers. The story introduces new characters, and the old characters have new motives. The overarching storylines of some of those characters are mentioned, and are even major factors of the main story at points! The game is a third person shoulder shooter with survival horror atmosphere. The game controls okay on PC, but the keyboard and mouse controls don't really do the ""limited movement"" charm of this game justice. It's kinda hard to be in a tense situation when you could just flick your wrist and blow somebody's head off. If you have the money, play this game with a controller. It's near perfection with a controller. Also, there is a heavy focus of limiting ammo in this game even though the game favors enemy confrontation rather than enemy avoidance. Of course, you could always charge into battle holding down fire, but that's just plane stupid. There are many, many ways to dispatch the enemies. You have melees and knives, so knock yourself out.There are, however, some problems I had with the game.1. I thought the game was just a bit too easy even on the hardest difficulty2. There are only 3 difficulty settings3. There are few boss battles4. The game reuses a few of their fights with little to no changes5. Some of the characters are not fleshed out, no matter how self aware the game isOverall, RE4 is an amazing game. If you've never played it before, pick it up right now. After playing it, it became my favorite game of all time. Just be cautious if you are a hardcore shooter player. The tank controls and not being able to aim while moving are hard to get used to. I give Resident Evil 4 a solid 9.5/10			"

												Although it is the first indication of the change in Resident Evil, it is also the top mark in 3rd person action, and gameplay! If you have not experianced this game yet, you will not regret it.EDIT: Although my profile states 2 hours on record, I have owned 3 copies of the game on the Playstation 2, Xbox 360, and now the steam version. Having played through the game multiple times, I can safely say this is a worthwhile purchase.			"

												RE:4 is a classic. It has been ported over many times to different platforms and for good reason. This port in particular is an excellent one, adding HD textures and aditional extras that didn't ship with the original GameCube on its initial launch. The game features great controller support, but I've found that a mouse and keyboard to be my new favorite way to play. If you're new to the game, this is currently the best way to get into it. PROS: Gripping storySolid mechanicsSatisfying inventory systemReplayability with different modes unlockedSolid ""level"" designCONS:Menu navigation could use work with kb+mouseOverall I'd give the game 8/10. The game would of been a perfect 10, but I feel like the atmosphere lacks a little in this game. Something the RE franchise lost over time, but it doesn't disqualify this entry from being one of the best in the series.			"

												Besides the delay filled cutscenes and the assraping frame lag when theres too many particles and/or when using the Sniper Rifle, its well worth the $20.00 you pay for it. If you're very anal about cosmetics and performance maybe wait it out until they throw out some patches to fix theese issues, or if you're not stupid like me and you can actually tweak your settings to improve performance, do that instead.And I highly reccomend playing it with an Xbox360 controller, If possible. I've been instructed by a friend that the Keyboard/Mouse controls are sluggish and stupidly bound.All in all, fun as ♥♥♥♥, I'd give it 7/10. The score would be higher if those damn video faults wern't there QQ			"

												Stil a great game after all these years, and challenging as well. This game is not easy and not for anyone who enjoyed RE6, as they are leagues apart. The horror elements are strong and pop up everywhere and the game handles survival well enough by pitting you against enough enemies with limited supplies, and expecting you and a partner to survive. The puzzles are decent and still prevalent, the shooting is stellar, the mechanics of the game have enough action to stay interesting, and most deaths wont be cheap, minus the QTE that this game spawned in the series. This game is easily head ans shoulders above its series' counterparts and a true highlight of a Resident Evil that kept true to its tank-like survival horror style and the sequels which were inspired by the true life of Michael Bay. This game earns itself a perfect 10/10, and you should play it, if you haven't already.			"

												I would recommend this game if it was still the 30fps and gamecube graphics.There is a reason it has been ported to almost every system ever made.about 16+ hours for the first playthrough then so much more for all the extras.Every character in this game is likeable and unique.Alot of people see this game as the start to Resident Evil's Downfall but even they still acknowledge it is a great game.They did promise that we would be able to switch to ""HD"" or ""Original"" graphics ingame and that we would be able to switch from 30fps to 60fps in game and also the subtitles are only for other languages(You can switch them only from the main menu) and the special graphics option was also a disapointment beacuse it was just a color filter. They also say that only the Sepreate ways cutsecenes are not in HD(Another disappointment) however a few short cutscenes in the main game do not look HD. When they said there would be leaderboards  I thought it would be for mercenaries like many others, however it is only just for speed run times on the main game and other modes.If you have never played the game before now is a great time.

												Nostalgia at it's finest. You get a remastered version of the game plus ""Seperate Ways"" for only 20 bucks. You can't beat that. The games shades and textures definitely make the game feel brand new again. 60 frames keep it fast-paced and will keep you on your toes while still looking smoother than ever. Playing with a controller is a must seeing as how the keyboard and mouse controls feel too rigid. Keep post process quality off unless you want the game to run like like a one-legged dog with a vestibular disorder. If you experience any lag you may need to adjust the anisotropic filtering. I found it strange that the subtitles option was locked at 'off'. No matter. I highly reccomend this port for Biohazard veterans and newcomers alike. Steam definitely redeemed the PC version of Biohazard 4 on this one. 10/10			"

												An old classic. There isn't much to be said about it that probably hasn't been said before, so I'll just strongly encourage you to buy it. Sure, it's a little dated, but it's a decade old. RE4 is by far the most fun of the entire franchise, and some parts still give me goosebumps. The only downside is, of course, the gameplay mechanics that plague (ha!) Resident Evil. It's clunky on purpose, to drive up the stress you feel during combat. But RE 4 takes what should be frustrating and turns it into a rewarding victory when you do succeed. Most of the game is an escort mission, but Capcom even managed to make that seem fun too. Your charge is smart and durable. She makes her way to safety and fights to keep from getting caught. Just don't try to look up her skirt. Yes, I'm serious.Yeah, sometimes the dialogue sounds like someone put a bunch of lines into a hat and just drew them at random, but the story still progresses with the help of the stiff but somehow likeable characters. The action more than makes up for canned conversations. You'll fight your way out of gloomy castles, rained out villages, and the obligatory Resident Evil laboratory. The puzzles aren't really demanding, but you're not here to play Myst, are you? Bottom line: get it even if RE4 is the only RE game you'll ever play.			"

												An instant classic, one of the best games ever released on the Gamecube, and quite possibly the peak of the RE franchise that'll never be reached again until CRAPCOM starts getting their♥♥♥♥♥♥together, with the only other game near its awesomeness being RE2. This is the time when the RE franchise focused more on Horror and tense gameplay (and a little bit on puzzles as well,) and much less on Action (RE5 and RE6.) At least Revelations was a step in the right direction, so let's hope they can manage to follow up on it.Wonderful tension thanks to the stiffness of the game - RE6 proved this, with its non-stiffy-ness. A perfect blend of Horror and Action. But let's be honest here; We all hate babysitting Ashley.PS. Make sure to check out the RE4HD fan project. The amount of work put into it is outright amazing.

												Resident Evil 4 is the best game ever. I mean that. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpeice. Every setpeice puts a first time player on edge with effective scares, scenery and  atmosphere. I've completed this game around 14 times, give or take. I spent many restless hours piddling through this game when it first came out. I was young at the time, and I never played anything like it. It was indescribably captivating. As a veteran now, even my proffesional playthroughs are pieces of cake that run like clockwork, but that first fluid playthrough as a kid playing on my friends gamecube eating junk food and shivering in fear was a perfect gamin experience. What a wouldn't give for the feeling of the tingling of my knuckles and the drop in my stomach I felt  the first time I saw Dr. Salvador. The game is comprised into three acts like a movie. The first consisting of Leon's forray into the parasite infested forrests of Madrid, the second into a mansion landscape with bizarre cultists around every corner, and the final a makeshift industrial complex where Umbrella tests on the Spain denisans. Each room  or area is memorable in an unbelievable way. After playing through once or twice you could do it with your eyes closed. This inspired a genre of the uninspired. But what it has over other 3rd person cover shooters at the time is that it's great, a masterpiece. For any gamer it's a practically mandatory experience. I've bought it on every console it's came out on. Do yourself a favor and buy it. (just be sure to set the game to 30 FPS due to the speed bugs caused by 60 FPS.)			"

												One of my most favorite games of all time. If you haven't played this game you were either too young to realize what your missing by not playing it or you live under a rock. In some third world ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And you should still rob the nearest person with a couple dollars to there name and get this game.			"

												My first time ever playing this game was here on steam and I admit it needs a couple adjustmants here and there to get it to play correctly but in the end once you've got your specs and changes right the game is fun as hell! Only drawback is that you need a good graphics card and a high resolution to play this beast of a game. I'd recommend this game to anybody with a computer that can play it.			"

												Although it is the first indication of the change in Resident Evil, it is also the top mark in 3rd person action, and gameplay! If you have not experianced this game yet, you will not regret it.EDIT: Although my profile states 2 hours on record, I have owned 3 copies of the game on the Playstation 2, Xbox 360, and now the steam version. Having played through the game multiple times, I can safely say this is a worthwhile purchase.			"

												Resident Evil 4. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this with mouse and keyboard support, aiming is infinitely easier and more fun (faster and more precise and easier to control), even though I first played this on ps2. Controller support is also there. You can switch between/use both seemlessly, which is always nice in any game (seriously, the more games should implement this, the better). I tend to use the mouse in RE4 now, despite starting on ps2, and even though I use a controller for RE5. Currently only the character models are remastered in HD, but there are very nice HD reskins in the works that are making the entire game look better, improving all the textures by 8-16x and so on. Game is optimized well. Despite the long awaited 'being able to move and shoot' in RE6, 4 and 5 remain better games. Mercenaries is a fun arcade mode that adds replay value as well, then you have 'Seperate Ways' and 'Assignment Ada'; short, but extra campaigns. Campaign/professional mode and mercenaries are the meat and potatoes. Unlocking the super weapons is fun and rewarding. After using them for a while you'll want to go back to starting over with more regular weapons for a challenge, or playing mercenaries. A lot of people apparently joke about the story of this one, while it's not without its cliches and perhaps a few laughable moments, it's not bad at all; I've always liked what of a story is there. Great game. ""Help me, Leon!""			"

												RE:4 is a classic. It has been ported over many times to different platforms and for good reason. This port in particular is an excellent one, adding HD textures and aditional extras that didn't ship with the original GameCube on its initial launch. The game features great controller support, but I've found that a mouse and keyboard to be my new favorite way to play. If you're new to the game, this is currently the best way to get into it. PROS: Gripping storySolid mechanicsSatisfying inventory systemReplayability with different modes unlockedSolid ""level"" designCONS:Menu navigation could use work with kb+mouseOverall I'd give the game 8/10. The game would of been a perfect 10, but I feel like the atmosphere lacks a little in this game. Something the RE franchise lost over time, but it doesn't disqualify this entry from being one of the best in the series.			"

												Resident Evil 4 is by far my favorite Resident Evil Game. The game stars Leon (first introduced in Resident Evil 2) as he searches for the President's daugther Ashley. He finds the both of them injected with a parasite called ""Las Plagas"" by a man named Sadler and must escape while searching for a cure and a way to stop Sadler. The game moves away from the T-Virus and focuses on this new threat. The game is an over the shoulder Third Person Shooter game unlike other RE titles, and brings a bit more action to the table. Unlike future installments however, RE4 doesn't ditch puzzles entirely and there are still a few great ones. While Leon has access to more weapons and ammo then other games, Enemies are a bit more tricky. Some will try to dodge his attacks, while others will sprout a Las Plagas upon defeat that takes over their body (Not unlike the Anime/ Manga Parasyte). The game has quite the few tense moments (like the one hit Kill Chainsaw Weilders) but is not too difficult. My one major complaint is the lack of Subtitles when playing with the Language set to English. Other than that, RE4 is an awesome RE game that stands at a comprimise between the older titles, and the action based Resident Evil 5 and 6			"

												A very fun and probably one of the greatest Resident Evil games that was ever developed with all things considered with the later games. The game was the first to change up the formula from the old camra angles that remained stationary, that many games afterwards would reproduce, thinking that was what made te series scarey, but often doing it really bad compared to Resident Evil.With this one it changes to a 3rd person perspective with the camra following close behind so you don't realise an enemy is behind you until it's too late and the upgrades to the weapons can make some of the weakest weapons, the best in the entire game.The story itself has some great cheese to it, which makes it a lot of fun with interesting antagonists to engage in and Leon Kennedy being quite a fun character too in the entire thing with his unsubtle way of hitting on women and making many quips against his enemies before he finally faces them.What's most fun is the unlockable weapons from completeing the game, completeing the additional game content such as Operation Ada and Seporate ways, both starring Ada Wong who you meet in the game and you play as her with her grapplying hook, replacing the need for a second character to help piggyback over areas.It's a really fun game and when playing alone can get quite creepy with the new enemy who aren't zombies, but are possessed with little to no free will of their own.

												The controls are really awful and some of the movie files are low-res, but the game is a hell of a lot of goofy fun and easily overcomes that and any other issues with its age.  All the characters, dialogue, setpieces and the plot are utterly ridiculous but this is NOT a bad thing.  It remains a really charming game and certainly good for at least one playthrough, including Ada's Side-Mission Extra you unlock by beating the game for the first time.			"

												A turning point for the series, the genre and the industry at large. Game play, sound design and art design are interwoven so well that the experience is truly visceral. The feeling of dread, terror, suspense and panic are put upon the player in all mixes, and the game's incredible pacing and generous campaign deliver it all in spades. Possibly the best third-person perspective game I've played. There's the right mix of progression, puzzle tasks, item upgrades, weapon introductions, boss fights, and environments that stun the player in their imagination.			"

Heavily recommended if you are even the least bit curious.The version at the time of this review i'm writing seems to have plenty of compatibility issues. For people with laptops here's how I fixed my game crashing: go to Services , and stop the service that says ""Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service"". Don't ask my what's the relation, all I know is that my game crashed every 15 minutes unless I stopped this service. You're welcome.			"

""Luiiiiiiiiis!""This is only my second Resident Evil game (the first being Resident Evil Revelations), but I really enjoyed it a lot.Story:The story... didn't really make that much sense, but that's okay. You arrive at this small village where the president's kidnapped daughter has been spotted, but soon realize that something is wrong. When you find the girl, at first the bad guy says he plans to keep her for ransom. Then they need her for some kind of ritual. Sometimes they want you dead. Other times they just let you live. However, one thing that should be said about the story is that it really makes you (or at least me) want to play Resident Evil 5, 'cause it sort of ends on a cliffhanger.Gameplay:Coming straight from Resident Evil Revelations, it took me a while to get used to the way aiming worked in Resident Evil 4. At first I tried using a mouse and a keyboard, but that made controlling Leon really awkward, so I switched to my gamepad, which worked out much better.On my first playthrough I just shot pretty much anything that moved, which led to me running low on certain types of ammo pretty often, but on my second playthrough I relied much more on my knife and melee attacks, resulting in me having to sell ammo because my inventory was full. Despite my second playthrough being on professional (hard), it felt much easier than my first playthrough, so the game might be a bit easy for some people. It does have its hard parts though, and I died multiple times during certain (boss) fights. However, more often than not it was not me, but Ashley, our damsel in distress, who ended up dying. I thought she was suppose to be their precious hostage or part of some ritual or whatever, but apparently that doesn't mean that they won't kill her...And I'm not sure if some of the quick time/button mashing events in the game are bugged or not, but I spammed that X-button as fast as I could, and poor Leon still dropped down into the abyss. In the end I had to put my controller on the desk and just press the button as fast as I could using my index finger. Some people say that it might have something to do with the game not being optimized for 60 fps, which could certainly be the case.Graphics:The game is fairly old, but it still looks good to me. Certain parts of the environment/background look pretty bad, as does Leon when he is wearing his gangster outfit, but those are just minor details. Most of the enemies look good/creepy/silly/crazy, which is what's most important.One thing that was a bit annoying though was that the game would slow down at times, making it feel like you are playing the game in slow motion. This seems to be a common issue, and while I did try some of the fixes posted on the forums, nothing worked. It made the game a bit easier than it should be (since you have more time to react to things), but it only happened a few times, so I just lived with it.Music:The music fits the mood pretty well, but as soon as you notice that creepy music = danger, no creepy music = safe, it sort of makes the game less scary.Also, some of those voice actors/lines were pretty damn funny (even when they weren't suppose to be). ""Luiiiiiiiiiis!"" was my personal favorite, but ""Miiiiiiiiiiiike!"" was pretty great as well. Just not ""Leooooooon!""Overall:Overall I enjoyed this game a lot, and although it was not as creepy/scary as Resident Evil Revelations, and also felt a bit easier, both of those Resident Evil games have been a hit for me. It took me about 20 hours to finish the campaign once (the difficulty didn't really make a difference), plus a couple of hours on the extra missions which you don't wanna' miss, so I can definitely recommend this game - even at full price.Resident Evil 5 ReviewResident Evil Revelations Review			"

												Bit of a let down to be honest.I mean... whilst I'm sure the gameplay is good and the metascore is definitely decent; a port that was promised to live up to the best version, sadly... just doesn't. Keyboard and mouse controls could have been a bit more refined, but they seem to have been implemented in the cheapest, easiest and most convenient way possible and I could say the same with the 'HD' graphics. Everything about this port just seems rushed, budgeted and minimalistic.Still, I do recommend it for people that have never played RE:4, but if you already own any version; save those pennies.			"

												Resident Evil 4 is one of my favorite games of all time.  This game blew my mind 11 years ago when I first played and it is to this day one of the best games I have ever played.  At the time the shooting mechanics, with the over the shoulder and with the laser sight, were revolutionary and although easier to use than the previous Resident Evil titles, still could create lots of tension.  This game was also one of the first games to ever use quick time events that would add so much cinematic elements to the game and would be used in many other games several years later.  This is probably one of the few perfect games I have every played.			"

												It's Resident Evil 4. Of course it's great. If you haven't played it yet, why? One of the best 3rd person action games ever made and the port isn't total garbage. This is also the only port that allows 60fps gameplay, which after playing is impossible to go back to 30. 60fps can cause slowdown after menus or pausing, but it can be fixed by pausing completely and then unpausing. Also, free look can be somewhat problematic but it's entirely manageable.Plays surprisingly well with the Steam Controller with correct configs.just buy it and get your head choppde off by the chainsaw man.9.8/10			"

												Great game. This is the first RE game I have played, via a recommendation. Absolutely loved it, so I went back and bought the original one when it was on sale. Beautiful atmosphere, in a dark, disturbing way. The monsters are creepy. Don't shoot them in the head (why did you just do that after I warned you not to?).			"

												Resident Evil 4 is a fun game that has much to offer. I think the best part of Resident Evil 4 (as well as other Resident Evils) it the inventory management. Personally I am addicted to upgrading and buying new weapons and that made me search every area up and down to scratch by with the latest purchase from the merchant. It's also great when you're almost out of ammo and surrounded by enemies to offer that fleeting experience. Admittedly it does lose that survival aspect half way through the game and becomes more action oriented, but that just makes it better.			"

												Resident Evil 4. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this with mouse and keyboard support, aiming is infinitely easier and more fun (faster and more precise and easier to control), even though I first played this on ps2. Controller support is also there. You can switch between/use both seemlessly, which is always nice in any game (seriously, the more games should implement this, the better). I tend to use the mouse in RE4 now, despite starting on ps2, and even though I use a controller for RE5. Currently only the character models are remastered in HD, but there are very nice HD reskins in the works that are making the entire game look better, improving all the textures by 8-16x and so on. Game is optimized well. Despite the long awaited 'being able to move and shoot' in RE6, 4 and 5 remain better games. Mercenaries is a fun arcade mode that adds replay value as well, then you have 'Seperate Ways' and 'Assignment Ada'; short, but extra campaigns. Campaign/professional mode and mercenaries are the meat and potatoes. Unlocking the super weapons is fun and rewarding. After using them for a while you'll want to go back to starting over with more regular weapons for a challenge, or playing mercenaries. A lot of people apparently joke about the story of this one, while it's not without its cliches and perhaps a few laughable moments, it's not bad at all; I've always liked what of a story is there. Great game. ""Help me, Leon!""			"

Finally, he kills the Mastermind who was responsible for all of this and escapes together with Princess Peach on a Jet-Ski to get laid. All the while, he finds drugs to cure his wounds and to improve his health (Legalise Weed!) and sells treasures and goods from the people he kills to a teleporting Merchant who may or may not be the TRUE mastermind behind everything!

												My Fab game from reisdent evil games. I'm happy it was given to HD when I play 100's of hours on the ps2 version.When it become HD though I feel that Dark atmosphere is gone and that resident evil feel of survival and horror is pretty gone. It looks like your playing an average third person shooter. You do have the choice to pick HD or not so you can get the feel of what the game used to be so It's not that bad but I Think the atmosphere Is what makes Resident Evil special in background.Becides that. the game is amazing. 3 Main areas Village,Castle and Island (sounds dull but that's the names)One bad part about this game I think Many would agree is Ashley. A whiny, annoying little girl that everytime she's in danger, it sounds like she dropped her milk at school. over half way of the game, Leon on his own and that's the shine of this survival Horror, not a girl piggy backing you.

												This game is awesome! RE4 is my favourite game of all time.Yes, the controls are a little clunky, you can't strafe and you have to stand still to shoot, but each of these factors add to the tension of the game. They make things a little uncomfortable and a little more dangerous... (In a lesser game, no strafe movements and having to be still to shoot would be deal-breakers for me, but I got the hang of them quite quickly and haven't really missed them at all).RE4 has fantastic atmosphere, challenging bosses and even the QTEs aren't nearly as frustrating as most other games I have played. I was initially concerned about having to babysit an AI character (Ashley) and though (in a few of my other-console playthroughs) she caused me to die more than a few times, her presence added to the 'danger' of the game. (I know a lot of players hated Ashley, but I thought she could be fun to protect).So whether you play this on one of many consoles, I recommend it! Give it a shot!			"

Quick Breakdown: A remastered version of Capcom’s 2005 horror classic. At times a slow paced survival game, punctuated with bursts of more frenetic third person shooter action.Length: 20-25 (Main game), 30+ (Main + extras)Genre: Survival Horror / Third Person Shooter / ActionScore: 8.5/10Review Date: 2016-07-04Full Review: Having not initially played this game until almost a decade after its release, it’s more difficult for me to fully grasp the impact it originally had on the industry, and while I’d love to go in depth with that, I’m just not familiar enough with those details. Instead we’ll focus on what we have here, which is a game that is still fantastic to play, even for the first time.You play as Leon Kennedy, as US government agent sent to rescue the President’s daughter from a crazed cult in Spain. While doing so, he uncovers a more sinister plot involving a mind controlling parasite known as Las Plagas. It’s a pretty decent story, and more than enough to keep things interesting.On to the meat of RE4: the gameplay, and it’s solid. The controls are a little bit dated, utilizing tank controls, in which your character turns left and right instead of strafing, and the mouse aims without changing the camera angle. It took some getting used to, but probably 2 or 3 hours of gameplay, but it was worth it in the end. While I certainly prefer more modern controls, they at least works for the game.The game starts off very slow paced, very much a survival horror game in its early stages, having to scrounge around for weapons, health, and ammo, and just barely managing to scrap by. Resources eventually become a more easily manageable thing in the later game, once it transitions to be more action heavy. That’s not to say you can ever stop worrying and just coast without thinking of supplies, especially since you have to play inventory tetris. You have a limited amount of carrying space, represented by a grid, which each item taking up one or more grid spaces, and in various shapes representing the item itself. It’s not the perfect system, and it has its drawbacks, but at the same time it has a charm to it that does add a unique element to the game, while managing to benefit the survival element of the game.The game has a good horror atmosphere, featuring unsettling environments, and a host of interesting enemies, from crazed villagers, horrible beasts, parasitic lifeforms, and religious fanatics. The bosses in the game are massive, colossal behemoths, grotesquely deformed parasites, and a hell of a lot of fun to fight.Some of the game seems to draw a lot of inspiration from John Carpenter’s The Thing, which given that it’s one of my favourite movies ever, is certainly a good thing. This can be seen in some of the enemies (Las Plagas seems to borrow some inspiration), and especially a level in the later part of the game set in a frozen laboratory (which also calls to mind the original The Thing From Another World from 1951). Possibly I’m drawing more connections between the two given that I greatly enjoy each, but it’s nonetheless something that I can’t help but notice and chalk up as a positive.If there’s any downside to the gameplay that jumps out, it’s the quick time events, which add little-to-nothing, and are sometimes frustrating. There’s even a QTE or two where some people had to turn down their graphic settings, else they’re impossible to pass. I don’t remember if I personally had this problem, but I know my brother did, and he played on a machine similar to mine. For reference, one of them was the QTE at the end of an action filled mine cart passage (which in itself was a lot of fun), but the QTE involved rapid button mashing.The game itself looks beautiful, the remastered graphics manage to really bring out the environments and enemies. I haven’t played any of the previous versions of the game, but from what I’ve read poking around online, this is the best version to play if you’re new to the game. If you’ve already played the game before, there’s no need to play through this again just because it’s been remastered, unless of course you simply want to play it again since it’s a great game. (Something I myself intend to do at some point).The main game itself will take you around 20 or so hours to finish the main campaign; though I think I took a bit longer than that myself, adjusting to the controls, and exploring everything. (Not that I got 100% or anything). There are a few bonuses that you manage to unlock by finishing the campaign, a pair of mini-campaigns where you play as Ada Wong, which will take about an hour or two each, and are a fun romp.There’s also a mini-game, called The Mercenaries, in which you can play as 5 different characters (4 of which must be unlocked), and your aim is to earn as high a score as possible before the time runs out. Points are earned by killing enemies, with combos and boss enemies rewarding more points. It’ll help kill at least an hour or so just dicking around, and it’s decent fun.If you’re a fan of horror games, especially survival horror mixed with action, this is a must play. Otherwise, it might not do much for you, but it’s worth at least a try if it piques your interest.			"

												The orginal hybrid of action and survival horror. Before RE5 Gears of Warsed everything, removed the humor and traced and retread RE4 (But with fun COOP and excellent tech) you playws as Dude Americana as he ♥♥♥♥s up a place full of blonde hating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s/zombies/ganados (Which totally aren't just zombies that can hold things.) in Europe where everyone speaks broken badly acted Spanish in addition to dropping ammo even though they don't use guns in an attempt to save the Presidents idiot daughter Ashely who dresses like a 5 year old and is one mocha latte away from being a basic you know what. That said seriously the Spanish in this game is RE1 levels of wrong. The games level design is amazing and while not the first it pioneered the over the shoulder perspective. It still holds up and looks great for 04/05 (Especially because it came with lighting and mouse aiming this time unlike the 2007 port by Ubisoft or Source something that was removed from Steam but not forgotten by me). There is a lot more action this time around but Proffesional difficulty will keep this from devolving into a mindless shooter and it will keep you on your toes. It never gets dulls thanks to the well done set peices and changes of scenery. Investing time and ingame money on upgrades for weapons still feel like they are worth your time even after all these years. Not to mention the Merchant is an excellent character and mechanic that never appeared in future titles. I'd buy a game with him in it at a high price! The few issues I have are the later levels feeling a bit ""we gotta finish this game already"" and the dated quick time events which while invented by Shenmue were popularized by RE4. Stuff like running from a boulder in the middle of a small village feels disjointed and isn't particularly fun the first, second or third time let alone whenever I replay it years later. The presidents daughter could be seen as a slight negative but having played it myself I feel that the claims were greatly exaggerated. Shockingly she is less of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥then your armed ""partner"" Sheva in RE5 and she gives you a wider FOV when she's with you making her useful too. Rarely if ever does she get in your way or get captured unless you are REALLY not paying attention. She does get captured in a lot of the cutscenes though you ♥♥♥♥ing cucks. Pick up this game at whatever price it's at because it's worth your time and money.My review of Resident Evil 5 (The product as a whole) can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/21690My review for Resident Evil 6 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/221040 "

												EDIT: I have since re-done this review, because the game received a patch back in April.  Since then it has become much, much more playable.CHANGES:--There exists now a ""modern"" mode which fixes the clunky, unresponsive mouse controls, making them much more smooth and fast.  (Also in classic, the unresponsiveness has been fixed, but the sensitivity is much lower than it would be in modern)--A and D are still used for actually TURNING.  This is an intended feature, however, and the game is balanced around it.  You get used to it, eventually.  You can use the mouse to free-look quite well, while not aiming.  --The quick-turn button still isn't always responsive, but you have to hold S and then press Shift for it to recognize the input.  Q can also initiate a quick-turn.There is still a problem with the low FoV, but it's an intended feature much like the tank control turning.The game is now much more playable for mouse + keyboard input.  I p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶d̶ died for 6 hours straight the day before I wrote this.  Very fun.------------------------OLD, OUTDATED REVIEW WRITTEN BY SOME STUPID NERD (me):------------------------The game itself is great, no one will dispute that.  However, this port, I found, isn't very friendly to M&KB:--I had to move my mouse across my desk at least 4 times to do a complete 360 (This is at maximum sensitivity)--You can't steer with just M&KB, you have to use just the keyboard for turning (A and D to turn left & right.. but you get used to it)--There is significant delay for actions sometimes.  For example, when you pull out your knife and go to swing it at someone (using the keyboard), it takes about a second for the game to recognize that you're actually moving your mouse.--The quick-turn button (shift + S) doesn't always recognize your inputs, so times when I wanted to turn around to start actually defending myself, I couldn't.  I couldn't, because I ended up tapping the keys about 3 times, and all Leon did was backpedal a little.--The mouse is vastly inferior to the controller for this game, because all too often, the game hinders the use of the mouse by slowing it down to stupid levels.  I don't know why they didn't just use the code for the mouse that they used for RE5 (for aiming, general movement, ect).I get that the game is supposed to feel ""clunky,"" because after all, it IS a survival horror game.  SURVIVAL, combat is not supposed to be easy.  However, that doesn't mean it has to be broken for mouse input.  If you're not entirely sure what I mean by this, imagine the mouse controls for the original Dead Space on PC.  It can be that bad at times.On top of this, while I was playing (about 25 minutes in) I started to get HORRIBLE FPS drops.  In the top right of my screen, apparently the game kept queueing up a download for the art book and soundtrack.. but.. kept downloading them over, and over, and over again, while I was playing?  I got about 5-10 FPS at this point, when before I was getting 60 without drops.  Don't get me wrong, from a technical standpoint, this game is pretty rock solid when it comes to performance.  This was the only performance hitch I got.Specs:i7 2600k @ 3.4 GHz GTX 770 @ 4 GB 12 GB DDR3 RAM			"

												Alright, listen up. You probably have already played RE4 at some point, so this is going to be a ""port report"". First off, the game speed is tied to the framerate and you get to pick between a 30 and 60 FPS lock. Now although this is an old game, you are probably going to need at least a Quad-core CPU and more than 3GB of RAM if you want to run it at 60 and not experience any slowdowns even with the standart textures. The game was never meant to work at 60 FPS, and this is especially obvious when it's raining and the framerate gets cut in half, but I think this is probably because I'm barely over the minimum requirements. Also, I believe that 6 patches in, QLOC, unlike Capcom, have done all they could to truly make this the definitive version of RE4 given their limitations. Even if you have to play the game at 30 FPS with standart textures, you still get a version with all DLC (unless you are German, because again: Capcom), proper PC controls (you still have to deal with tank controls, but at least you get proper QTE prompts, rebindable keys and mouse aiming) and basic modding support with a HD mod project being worked on as we speak, which is set to replace EVERY texture with a HD one.In conclusion: This is a decent port and QLOC did everything they could to fix and improve it (unlike Capcom which can't be bothered to patch RE5 more than once after they did a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job of porting it to Steamworks, instead just adding trading cards and stickying fan fixes for gamebreaking bugs).

Quick Breakdown: A remastered version of Capcom’s 2005 horror classic. At times a slow paced survival game, punctuated with bursts of more frenetic third person shooter action.Length: 20-25 (Main game), 30+ (Main + extras)Genre: Survival Horror / Third Person Shooter / ActionScore: 8.5/10Review Date: 2016-07-04Full Review: Having not initially played this game until almost a decade after its release, it’s more difficult for me to fully grasp the impact it originally had on the industry, and while I’d love to go in depth with that, I’m just not familiar enough with those details. Instead we’ll focus on what we have here, which is a game that is still fantastic to play, even for the first time.You play as Leon Kennedy, as US government agent sent to rescue the President’s daughter from a crazed cult in Spain. While doing so, he uncovers a more sinister plot involving a mind controlling parasite known as Las Plagas. It’s a pretty decent story, and more than enough to keep things interesting.On to the meat of RE4: the gameplay, and it’s solid. The controls are a little bit dated, utilizing tank controls, in which your character turns left and right instead of strafing, and the mouse aims without changing the camera angle. It took some getting used to, but probably 2 or 3 hours of gameplay, but it was worth it in the end. While I certainly prefer more modern controls, they at least works for the game.The game starts off very slow paced, very much a survival horror game in its early stages, having to scrounge around for weapons, health, and ammo, and just barely managing to scrap by. Resources eventually become a more easily manageable thing in the later game, once it transitions to be more action heavy. That’s not to say you can ever stop worrying and just coast without thinking of supplies, especially since you have to play inventory tetris. You have a limited amount of carrying space, represented by a grid, which each item taking up one or more grid spaces, and in various shapes representing the item itself. It’s not the perfect system, and it has its drawbacks, but at the same time it has a charm to it that does add a unique element to the game, while managing to benefit the survival element of the game.The game has a good horror atmosphere, featuring unsettling environments, and a host of interesting enemies, from crazed villagers, horrible beasts, parasitic lifeforms, and religious fanatics. The bosses in the game are massive, colossal behemoths, grotesquely deformed parasites, and a hell of a lot of fun to fight.Some of the game seems to draw a lot of inspiration from John Carpenter’s The Thing, which given that it’s one of my favourite movies ever, is certainly a good thing. This can be seen in some of the enemies (Las Plagas seems to borrow some inspiration), and especially a level in the later part of the game set in a frozen laboratory (which also calls to mind the original The Thing From Another World from 1951). Possibly I’m drawing more connections between the two given that I greatly enjoy each, but it’s nonetheless something that I can’t help but notice and chalk up as a positive.If there’s any downside to the gameplay that jumps out, it’s the quick time events, which add little-to-nothing, and are sometimes frustrating. There’s even a QTE or two where some people had to turn down their graphic settings, else they’re impossible to pass. I don’t remember if I personally had this problem, but I know my brother did, and he played on a machine similar to mine. For reference, one of them was the QTE at the end of an action filled mine cart passage (which in itself was a lot of fun), but the QTE involved rapid button mashing.The game itself looks beautiful, the remastered graphics manage to really bring out the environments and enemies. I haven’t played any of the previous versions of the game, but from what I’ve read poking around online, this is the best version to play if you’re new to the game. If you’ve already played the game before, there’s no need to play through this again just because it’s been remastered, unless of course you simply want to play it again since it’s a great game. (Something I myself intend to do at some point).The main game itself will take you around 20 or so hours to finish the main campaign; though I think I took a bit longer than that myself, adjusting to the controls, and exploring everything. (Not that I got 100% or anything). There are a few bonuses that you manage to unlock by finishing the campaign, a pair of mini-campaigns where you play as Ada Wong, which will take about an hour or two each, and are a fun romp.There’s also a mini-game, called The Mercenaries, in which you can play as 5 different characters (4 of which must be unlocked), and your aim is to earn as high a score as possible before the time runs out. Points are earned by killing enemies, with combos and boss enemies rewarding more points. It’ll help kill at least an hour or so just dicking around, and it’s decent fun.If you’re a fan of horror games, especially survival horror mixed with action, this is a must play. Otherwise, it might not do much for you, but it’s worth at least a try if it piques your interest.			"

												Resident Evil 4 is the (much beloved) black sheep of the Resident Evil series. While still maintaining the classic tank control scheme from a new perspective, Resi4 takes the prerendered action adventure series and turns it into an arcade action game. While the over the shoulder camera angle and setpiece levels lends itself as a more cinematic adventure, Resi4 is a thoroughly mechanically focused game and uses its tight and limited camera angle to create a claustrophobic survival thriller experience which no other game has managed to successfully replicate, including Capcom's own later efforts. If there is any grand flaw in this game, it's that Capcom explored the gameplay experiences this sort of 3rd person combat could provide so definitively in this one game that ironically it sort of refutes the need for another game to follow up on what this game provided. My only hangup is how mediocre this port is. I was almost ready to give this game the thumbs down because I was struggling to make this port work at all. Resi4 was never optimized to run at 60 fps, and that sadly remains true of this port. I ended up playing the game at 30 fps in order for it to be playable. This might be the only pc game in which anyone would recommend playing at 30 fps over 60, but there are other reasons besides optimization. It's clear that this game was designed to be played at the 30 fps mark, with mechanics, play speed and animation timing all built around a locked 30 fps. This isn't so much a failing of Resi4 or Capcom, but more a testament to how thoroughly this game was built to run for the system it was originally made for. There is nothing wrong with building a game around the limitations of the hardware it was meant for, many classic console games were made for the purposes of playing well on their native console. But it also means that when straight ports such as this one are made that they risk turning off die hard pc fans who refuse to drop below 60. If it's any consolation, this game plays very well at 30, and is one of the few pc games I'd ever play in which I was happy to play at 30 fps. This thumbs up is for how great Resi4 is to this day, despite the quality of this port and not because of it.			"

												Some people say this game ruined the Franchise, I disagree that title goes to RE5 even though RE5 is still a great game in it's own way but anyway onto the review: The Game does take away the Survival Horror routes but I think this was the last true Resident evil game as it still had some classic Resident evil moments which the future Resident evils took away until the Revelation series.Ashley is also a great addition to the game, some people might disagree with me but I loved protecting her not once did she do anything stupid when I played the game, the boss fights are unpredictable as well, you don't know when a Quick time event is going to happen which comes to my last point.The Quick Time events can go die in a hole, they refuse to work properly half the time even though I was clicking the right keys, the main issue happens in Chapter 4-4, the QTE there was just enough to almost make me rage quit but thank god I didn't as the rest of the game is pure amazing.Not only do you have the main game but when you finish the game you also unlock extra content such as playing 5 chapters about what Ada was doing during RE4, a non canon game mode where you play as Ada again retriving 5 Plaga samples, this game mode can be frustrating but is still fun and also The Mercenaries which is where some people spend most of their time but I really don't like The Mercnaries that much in this game it is so much better in RE5 because of the Co-op.Get the game, I really wish I could just play it for the first time again :(			"

												The game is made to be fun and is set in a spooky atmosphere. If you took the dirty, spooky, gross atmosphere out of this game it would still be fun unlike almost every horror game ever, which is why it's so replayable. Not to mention the 3 bonus missions (DLC expansions circa 2005) you get after beating the game and the three unlockable outfits you can get. I'd be okay spending $70 on this, unlike most games today this game is actually worth the money.			"

												The orginal hybrid of action and survival horror. Before RE5 Gears of Warsed everything, removed the humor and traced and retread RE4 (But with fun COOP and excellent tech) you playws as Dude Americana as he ♥♥♥♥s up a place full of blonde hating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s/zombies/ganados (Which totally aren't just zombies that can hold things.) in Europe where everyone speaks broken badly acted Spanish in addition to dropping ammo even though they don't use guns in an attempt to save the Presidents idiot daughter Ashely who dresses like a 5 year old and is one mocha latte away from being a basic you know what. That said seriously the Spanish in this game is RE1 levels of wrong. The games level design is amazing and while not the first it pioneered the over the shoulder perspective. It still holds up and looks great for 04/05 (Especially because it came with lighting and mouse aiming this time unlike the 2007 port by Ubisoft or Source something that was removed from Steam but not forgotten by me). There is a lot more action this time around but Proffesional difficulty will keep this from devolving into a mindless shooter and it will keep you on your toes. It never gets dulls thanks to the well done set peices and changes of scenery. Investing time and ingame money on upgrades for weapons still feel like they are worth your time even after all these years. Not to mention the Merchant is an excellent character and mechanic that never appeared in future titles. I'd buy a game with him in it at a high price! The few issues I have are the later levels feeling a bit ""we gotta finish this game already"" and the dated quick time events which while invented by Shenmue were popularized by RE4. Stuff like running from a boulder in the middle of a small village feels disjointed and isn't particularly fun the first, second or third time let alone whenever I replay it years later. The presidents daughter could be seen as a slight negative but having played it myself I feel that the claims were greatly exaggerated. Shockingly she is less of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥then your armed ""partner"" Sheva in RE5 and she gives you a wider FOV when she's with you making her useful too. Rarely if ever does she get in your way or get captured unless you are REALLY not paying attention. She does get captured in a lot of the cutscenes though you ♥♥♥♥ing cucks. Pick up this game at whatever price it's at because it's worth your time and money.My review of Resident Evil 5 (The product as a whole) can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/21690My review for Resident Evil 6 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/221040 "

												EDIT: I have since re-done this review, because the game received a patch back in April.  Since then it has become much, much more playable.CHANGES:--There exists now a ""modern"" mode which fixes the clunky, unresponsive mouse controls, making them much more smooth and fast.  (Also in classic, the unresponsiveness has been fixed, but the sensitivity is much lower than it would be in modern)--A and D are still used for actually TURNING.  This is an intended feature, however, and the game is balanced around it.  You get used to it, eventually.  You can use the mouse to free-look quite well, while not aiming.  --The quick-turn button still isn't always responsive, but you have to hold S and then press Shift for it to recognize the input.  Q can also initiate a quick-turn.There is still a problem with the low FoV, but it's an intended feature much like the tank control turning.The game is now much more playable for mouse + keyboard input.  I p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶d̶ died for 6 hours straight the day before I wrote this.  Very fun.------------------------OLD, OUTDATED REVIEW WRITTEN BY SOME STUPID NERD (me):------------------------The game itself is great, no one will dispute that.  However, this port, I found, isn't very friendly to M&KB:--I had to move my mouse across my desk at least 4 times to do a complete 360 (This is at maximum sensitivity)--You can't steer with just M&KB, you have to use just the keyboard for turning (A and D to turn left & right.. but you get used to it)--There is significant delay for actions sometimes.  For example, when you pull out your knife and go to swing it at someone (using the keyboard), it takes about a second for the game to recognize that you're actually moving your mouse.--The quick-turn button (shift + S) doesn't always recognize your inputs, so times when I wanted to turn around to start actually defending myself, I couldn't.  I couldn't, because I ended up tapping the keys about 3 times, and all Leon did was backpedal a little.--The mouse is vastly inferior to the controller for this game, because all too often, the game hinders the use of the mouse by slowing it down to stupid levels.  I don't know why they didn't just use the code for the mouse that they used for RE5 (for aiming, general movement, ect).I get that the game is supposed to feel ""clunky,"" because after all, it IS a survival horror game.  SURVIVAL, combat is not supposed to be easy.  However, that doesn't mean it has to be broken for mouse input.  If you're not entirely sure what I mean by this, imagine the mouse controls for the original Dead Space on PC.  It can be that bad at times.On top of this, while I was playing (about 25 minutes in) I started to get HORRIBLE FPS drops.  In the top right of my screen, apparently the game kept queueing up a download for the art book and soundtrack.. but.. kept downloading them over, and over, and over again, while I was playing?  I got about 5-10 FPS at this point, when before I was getting 60 without drops.  Don't get me wrong, from a technical standpoint, this game is pretty rock solid when it comes to performance.  This was the only performance hitch I got.Specs:i7 2600k @ 3.4 GHz GTX 770 @ 4 GB 12 GB DDR3 RAM			"

												I agree with Rock, Paper, Shotgun's conclusion that this feels like a PC port from 2007.  It's much better than the original port and it's nice and stable, but the controls are still clunky enough to give you some ""not quite there yet"" nostalgia.  For instance, if you want to quit the game you need to go to the main menu but there's no option to do so.  Instead there's a ""reset game"" option, which literally reloads the game and brings you to the main menu as though you'd hit a vestigial reset button.  You can play it with a mouse and keyboard but it feels awkward and clumsy, and there's enough crosshair jittering that the weapon stocks are still a worthwhile investment (which was not the case in the Wii version).  After playing with M+K for a while I switched to my X360 controller, which I found to be much more comfortable.  As for the graphics, well, it's a game from 2004.  They can toss on some filters and post-processing and slap in some higher res textures but there's only so much they can do.  This game is not look as good as Resident Evil 6.  Or 5.  Or Relevations.  It looks OK for what it is, which is a decent version of a great game.  If that's what you're looking for and you can forgive a few blemishes, give this one a shot.			"

												Resident Evil 4 has been my favoite game since i started playing games on PC , and now its on Steam with better video. I think this is 1 of the best games Valve has ever sold on Steam. The only problem though is that the cutscenes are slow and the gameplay moves slow in big areas of the game, but i dont know if thats me or the game itself. I still give this a 5/5 , thanks Valve :)			"

												Resident evil 4 is one of those games that I have fond memories of playing when I was younger. In my opinion, this is the best out of all the Resident Evil games. Maybe it's the nostalgia, but I just can't stop playing it. The first thing you need to realise, is that this game uses a 'tank' control scheme. What I mean by this is that you cant move while aiming your gun. You cannot side-strafe like in the 5th and 6th games, making it very awkward to play without a controller. That being said, the controls are as good as they can be on a keyboard and mouse, but I would still recommend using a gamepad.  I think these controls actual help the gameplay in several ways. First off, the game is in third person view, which obscures a lot of your view to begin with. Second, not being able to move or see at wide angles really helps the atmosphere. It makes you feel anxious in battles, especially when you know something is creeping up behind you. The gameplay is challenging and fun, but it may seem a bit repetitive at times. You will battle many bosses throughout the game, but they will all have a different style to them. Some bosses will have you running around enclosed spaces, trying to avoid their attacks, while some others will have a mostly stationary boss that sends in minions and hits you with powerful slow attacks. There are many weapons you can unlock and buy, including a rocket launcher (which can be used to cheat through some of the harder bosses.) The inventory system is one of my favorites in any game. You have to fit all of your guns, ammo, grenades, rocket launchers, and herbs into one tiny briefcase by roatating and organzing each and every item. Just picking up items is a puzzle! The graphics are nothing to write home about, and this particular port has bunch of framerate problems, but it isn't anything I would regret paying for. In the end, I would recommend this game over any other Resident evil game. And as a side note, the games' title is all lowercase letters in your steam library. This is a minor flaw, but when you have over 500 games like me, having only ONE lowercase steam title is irritating. Unfortunately, no amount of ♥♥♥♥♥ing will get this fixed, as it is a copyright problem.			"

												A snake drops Chicken eggs - Capcom Logic - would play again Resident Evil 4 is a survival horror game. It was first released in 2005 which makes it more then 10 years old, yet it still looks great GameplayIt is a port from consoles to a PC - second one. I played both, first one and this and I can say that this one is much better. Although controls can feel still sort of clunky, weird but bareable. Aiming is what you'd expect from console port... it is ""consolish"" at first it may feel really, really weird but after some 15-20 mins people will get used to it (whilst playing on mouse).As for the gameplay itself, for me game ran smoothly expcept for several occurances (reloading sniper rifle, some boss fights) when there was stuttering and drop in FPS rate, now that just might be me... eitherway it wasn't a big deal. The game is not that scary for those who are comming for horror factor. There are few times when you get scared but they are rather scarse... although if you are like me and get scared by sounds of weird breething and scary music, you ll be satisfied well enough. What I really enjoyed were Boss fights as they are each very different, there is wide enough range of enemies and changes in locations. What can get kinda annoying is protection of one NPC but that is only during few parts of one chapter if I remember correctly (thank god). There is wide range of weapons to choose from and upgrades (YAY!) for said weapons which makes gameplay and managing your money fun. You'll also need to look for hidden treasures and manage your ammo smart as it can be scarse at times. During the 5 chapters you'll encounter some 10 puzzles, some are fun, some are less so. Overall game plays nice and hours pass fast while you play, you'll enjoy your dose of cheesy lines and puns, tough macho proclamations by your characters and foes, few WTF moments and a lot of fun while shooting zombies heads off. GraphicsAs I stated before, the game is about 10 years old so don't expect miracles, some textures look good some don't. Overall I think that the game aged rather well, and gameplay makes up for the aging of the graphics anyways. What does look weird and goofy at times are explosions, those just don't look like explosions at all... it looks more like yellow bubble than explosion. But that is just small detail, I don't expect people are going to buy decade old game in expectation of graphics spectacle. ExtrasOutside of a main ""campaign"" or story mode, game offers several minigames that can keep you entertained for few more ours. Two of minigames are sort of mini campaigns, the third is sort of arcade stile game, where you play on maps from main game and you need to collect as much points as possible from killing zombies while under time limit. By playing these game you can unlock new costumes for characters in the game and more characters for the arcade style ""mercinaries"" game. SummaryOverall if you enjoy console games, bit of action, bit of horror, 3rd person shooter and boss fighting I would not hesitate to buy the game, although I would recommend to do so, if its on sale as full price seems a bit much.  7.5/10 "

												The best transition from horror to action/horror out there. Resident Evil 4 moves from a fixed camera with pre rendered backgrounds and tank controls. To an over the shoulder third person shooter but they didn't forget to put in some atmosphere and creepy enemy designs. Where Resident Evil 5 was just running through the bullet points of Resi 4. Resi 4 was the first of its kind in the Resident Evil Franchise. Forcing Capcom to try some new things but they were smart enough to keep Resi 4 feeling somewhat like a Resi game. There are plenty of Weapons to buy and upgrade, plenty of ways to limit yourself on future playthroughs to make the game harder. (Handgun only, Knife only, No Max Health Increasing Herbs, No Attache Case Upgrades, no weapon upgrades) There is a new game plus mode. Mercenaries mode, There are two side campaigns where you play as Ada. There's new costumes and hidden weapons to unlock. This game is basically my favorite Single Player Game of all time. I play through it at least once a year and if you haven't played it yet, you should.			"

												Has it really been almost ten years since this game came out?  Wow, time flies.  Given how many times Capcom has ported this game a Steam release was inevitable.  The game looks gorgeous and runs beautifully at 60fps.  Nothing has changed from the game.  It still has the dynamic difficulty mechanic and everything else you'd expect.  I'm also assuming it comes with the extra content that is on the PS2/Wii versions of the game.  If not, shame on you Capcom.  The only downside is the achievement list.  I was hoping for a bigger one.  Sadly, it's the same one that's on the PS3/360 versions.Side note:  The aiming sensitivity seems was higher than it was when I played the GC/PS2 versions.			"

												Looking for a game to become addicted to, especially a fan of New Game+? Look no further! I own the Wii and GC versions of this game, but this version is definitely top tier just due to the fact the textures and frame rate are superior in comparison to both of those. If you don't mind paying $20 to run through this fun action horror romp again, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Resident Evil 4, since its release, has been one of my favorite games of all time. In fact, it is probably tied with Ocarina of Time as my favorite game of all time. I played and beat the original on the gamecube hundreds of times, and I could not miss out on the opportunity to finally play it on my PC. My experience thus far with this port has been nothing short of fantastic. It is the same game I fell in love with a decade ago, but with a few neat bells and whistles to spruce it up. The HD looks good, but can be jarring at first, since I was very accustomed to the gritty looking old graphics. The sharpened look of everything actually may even make things look even faker than they used to, but it never detracts from the experience. The only real annoyance I have had is an inability to fully customize the controls for a gamepad. I have become very set in my ways using a gamecube controller, and some of the button mapping (while making sense) is just not for me. I keep pushing Y to go to my item screen, and keep pressing X to run. It will take a very long time to retrain myself, since the old controls are second nature/habit for me, and I wish I could just map them as I wish and do away with that learning curve. Other than this, the game seems flawless to me. I have encountered no bugs or performance issues, and have been enjoying this playthrough.			"

Crashes, fps problems, crashes, audio desynch, crashes-- you get the idea. I can't get it to get past the freakin' first half hour of the game, for pity's sake. Right as the bell rings, give or take a few minutes, the game essentially commits suicide.Capcom's done this one a massive disservice by releasing a port that just won't work. On Windows 10, at least. Until some kind of patch releases, this is virtually unplayable.I recommend it strongly but do yourself a favor and get another version on some other platform.			"

												I am gonna do a simple pros and cons review for this legendary game.Pros:-1. Gunplay which is extremely responsive and precise. You can even go to new game plus runs where you carry over your old weapons .While this makes the game easy yet it is satisfying to kill that boss which gave you so much trouble previously.2. Movement schemes which to some may seem hindering yet the pacing of the enemies make it viable.3. Separate ways and Assignment ada which are both excellent and show the story from a different perspective.4. The mercenaries. This is truly an amazing mode for RE4. You get to play as Leon,Ada,Hunk,Krauser and Wesker in 5 challenge maps. These give a new flavour to the gameplay and playing as Hunk ,Wesker or Krauser is extremely enjoyable.5.Boss fights. Some of the boss fights in this game are truly epic. The bosses are well balanced and can be taken down by simple handgun or a single shot rocket launcher .6. Weapons. No weapon is bad. The puny handgun you get at the beginning can help you till the end of the game. Even weapons which aren't considered good like mine thrower can be used effectively.7. This game isn't newbie friendly. You will have to give time and even then you will die alot. You'll have to give it time and learn to play.Cons:-1. Quick time events and button mash events are never a good thing.2. The Story is nice but the appearence of Ada as the mysterious lady and the age old cliched dialogues are not sweet on my ears.3. The performance can be a mixed bag for many. The graphics aren't that great and the 30/60fps cap occasionally slows down the game.Overall i'd say it is an amazing game although this port and the previous one leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance.

												I am a little bit bias going into this review considering this is an all time favorite to me but I will try my best to be objective for the sake of it being ported to PC   So right off the bat I want to plainly say the game runs fine.  At least for me but everyone's PC is different so some have issues and others do not.  About the so called HD textures, well I hate to pop any bubbles of self gratification but there not impressive nor do they look like that big of an overhaul over the originals Gamecube graphics.   Yet if your like me you could give two poops about that crap because we just wanted to kick some butt!  Now does the game run at 60 FPS.  Yes and no,  I will explain my observation on the subject.  The overall experiece runs at a great 60 fps and looks great. I could feel the quick responsiveness of Leon with those lovely tank controls but...  Some things are naturally going to be buggy considering this bueatiful piece of art was made a long time ago.  Some of the reload Animations are finnicky,  definately the rifle reload.  Everytime I reload my rifle it looks like Leon's whole animation for his weapon and body slows down  but the game is still running at 60 fps. Its like the reload animation is 15 fps and the game is ahead of it,  Its hard to explain  and not game  breaking either just clunky looking.  You can notice little things out of place on enemies because the game was never truly meant to be ran at 60 fps.   Other then that though its fine.       Alright so lets get down to what you really want to know should ya buy or nay.  Here's what I say if you love the game and you already have it on a console then I would say nay. Personally I feel this is just for people who want it on PC or perhaps dont have their consoles anymore. Now if you always dreamed of your favorite console game coming to PC like me then a big hell yes for buying it!   Overall it plays great and its relatively cheap.    Like always though think for yourself and draw your own conclusions and have a good day!			"

												Resident Evil 4 was one of the greatest survival horror games of the Gamecube and PS2 era, and still greatly holds up to this day.Without going into too much detail, it's your standard good vs. evil story line, with a few twists and turns along the way.That being said, there were no real plot twists that really left my jaw on the floor.But most people, including myself, don't play the Resident Evil games for the story. We play it for the fun, survival horror style elements , and decent gunplay. The lack of moving and aiming certainly feels dated, but this revolutionized the over the shoulder Third Person shooter. As I said, the game feels dated, but the new HD makeover looks pretty good.Finally, we have a Resident Evil game that runs at a constant 60 FPS, and it looks very fluid. That being said the framerate drops for some reason when reloading any sniper rifle. Note: You will need a pretty powerful PC to run this game on max settings.The dated feel and tank controls may turn off some ""newer"" gamers, but by itself, it still remains to be one of the greatest survival horror games in existence , and should be checked out by any fans of the the Resident Evil series, or survivial horror fans who missed it when it first came out.8.5/10 "

Simply perfectI have been playing RE4 since 2005, and ten years later this game still kicks major a$$.Very involved storyline, great soundtrack, an assortment of dope weapons, and groundbreaking visuals for its time. If you played the original PC version of this game (and you know how crappy it was), you will feel compensated with this HD remaster.The graphics are now more crisp, and trading cards along with achievements are a nice'n'sweet cherry on top of the cake. Having played this on the PS2 most of my life, the default joystiq controls for PC seemed quite uncomfortable, however installing a mod by DarkSamus fixed everything like a charm, so no problem there.To conclude,  this is a very solid game with loads of things to do, very solid HD remaster, and the price tag on this is more than reasonable. This game will please both Resident Evil and other action shooter fans alike.10/10 "

												This game is so good that if you played it and liked it you'd love to visit it back. And I did with the best aiming control: the mouse. If that's enough to get you interested then you should try it.Aiming  is responsive, but is needed to remind you the trembling of the aim is a game thing present in all versions, not just ""unresponsive aiming"". Game also responds pretty well to 360 joy. Also, for better control go to options and set aiming in Modern. If you didn't play this game but loved Dead Space and Evil Within, it may be very hard for this game to scare you, but combat is great. A very influential game, so influential than ruined or saved Horror games, depending on who you ask.			"

												Yup, exactly as I remember it being like... 10+ years ago or something... of course it's gotten a bit of a face lift.

God I'm old....) If you're looking for a solid survival horror game... well look elsewhere because this game was the beginning of the end for RE as we know it...

That's 13 playthroughs of the same game, I know it inside and out and it never gets old.I would write a in depth review of everything it did right, but it did EVERYTHING right.Just think about any part of a video game that can be done right, and the answer is YES.

												The Final Verdict: A-Resident Evil 4 barely shows it's age even now. It's still one of the best games you can play, and even more so if you're a zombie fan. It kind of started the trend of the game being even less survival horror. But if you play it again after playing Resident Evils 5 and 6, you will see how much more similar 4 is to the older games.I won't lie, yes I am a zombie fan, but this game is just a classic.			"

												This is both a really short review and a recommendation for those who are having the slow-motion cutscenes and slow-motion in game problems.The Review: I loved this game when it came out on Gamecube and PS2, and am loving it now that its on PC. By far my favorite Resident Evil game in the franchise. 9.5/10Now, for those who are having the aformentioned problems above, I found a solution for my computer (I will list specs at end of review.) What I think the problem is (at least for my computer) involves the two options for Frames Per Second in this game. My computer couldn't handle the game constantly trying to get itself at 60 FPS, thus causing the ""slow-motion"" effect. What I ended up having to do was turn my frames down to constant 30 FPS instead.  I also lowered the resolution down from 1600x900 to 1280x720. Both of these things can be done in the in game options/video options menu. This fixed slow motion problems and now my game runs just fine. If you continue to have these problems after lowering FPS and the resolutions (try experimenting) then you probably either have to slow of a computer, or something else is wrong. This is just a quick fix guide that happened to work perfectly for me and took like 2 minutes of experimenting to find my ideal setup.Now for my specs: AMD Quad-Core Processor A6-5200AMD Radeon HD 8400 Graphics Card6GB DDR3 MemoryI use Windows 8.1 (sometimes can affect games)Hopefully this helped anyone who was having these ""Slow-Mo"" problems, as I saw many people asking why this was happening in forums and on Steam.PS: Almost forgot, if you want to improve performance, right click on RE4 in your Library go to ""Properties"" then ""Set Launch Options"" then put in this: -high -cpuCount= -noSplash -maxMem=Now for cpuCount, put in how many cores you have for your computer, for example it should look like this: -cpuCount=6 if you have a 6 core processor.For -maxMem, put in the number of Mb of ram you have (there's 1024 megabytes in a gigabyte) so if you have 6 gigabytes of ram then it would look like: -maxMem=6144              because 6X1024=6144Mb. So now my first example would look like this with those specs: -high -cpuCount=6 -noSplash -maxMem=6144That's what it should look like when you type it in.As a last note, make sure all of the little dashes ""-"" are in front and there's spacing between each command            ""-high -cpuCount"" etc.Hopefully this helped those that were having these problems and the last bit helped those that just needed a little bit of help making the game run better. This is NOT a fix all, be all guide, it's just a little bit of help for that extra oomph and for those who were having the ""Slo-Mo"" problem.Cheers,Tiny Box TimPS: My computer is not the highest end as far as computers go (most who view my specs can probably tell), but I can run the game just fine after these changes. Also, apologies for this being kind of an essay. PSS: Also, ignore what Steam says about me not playing this game, it may say around 0.0 or 0.1 hours, but I've played at least 3 hours of the game.

												I am a little bit bias going into this review considering this is an all time favorite to me but I will try my best to be objective for the sake of it being ported to PC   So right off the bat I want to plainly say the game runs fine.  At least for me but everyone's PC is different so some have issues and others do not.  About the so called HD textures, well I hate to pop any bubbles of self gratification but there not impressive nor do they look like that big of an overhaul over the originals Gamecube graphics.   Yet if your like me you could give two poops about that crap because we just wanted to kick some butt!  Now does the game run at 60 FPS.  Yes and no,  I will explain my observation on the subject.  The overall experiece runs at a great 60 fps and looks great. I could feel the quick responsiveness of Leon with those lovely tank controls but...  Some things are naturally going to be buggy considering this bueatiful piece of art was made a long time ago.  Some of the reload Animations are finnicky,  definately the rifle reload.  Everytime I reload my rifle it looks like Leon's whole animation for his weapon and body slows down  but the game is still running at 60 fps. Its like the reload animation is 15 fps and the game is ahead of it,  Its hard to explain  and not game  breaking either just clunky looking.  You can notice little things out of place on enemies because the game was never truly meant to be ran at 60 fps.   Other then that though its fine.       Alright so lets get down to what you really want to know should ya buy or nay.  Here's what I say if you love the game and you already have it on a console then I would say nay. Personally I feel this is just for people who want it on PC or perhaps dont have their consoles anymore. Now if you always dreamed of your favorite console game coming to PC like me then a big hell yes for buying it!   Overall it plays great and its relatively cheap.    Like always though think for yourself and draw your own conclusions and have a good day!			"

												Resident Evil 4 was one of the greatest survival horror games of the Gamecube and PS2 era, and still greatly holds up to this day.Without going into too much detail, it's your standard good vs. evil story line, with a few twists and turns along the way.That being said, there were no real plot twists that really left my jaw on the floor.But most people, including myself, don't play the Resident Evil games for the story. We play it for the fun, survival horror style elements , and decent gunplay. The lack of moving and aiming certainly feels dated, but this revolutionized the over the shoulder Third Person shooter. As I said, the game feels dated, but the new HD makeover looks pretty good.Finally, we have a Resident Evil game that runs at a constant 60 FPS, and it looks very fluid. That being said the framerate drops for some reason when reloading any sniper rifle. Note: You will need a pretty powerful PC to run this game on max settings.The dated feel and tank controls may turn off some ""newer"" gamers, but by itself, it still remains to be one of the greatest survival horror games in existence , and should be checked out by any fans of the the Resident Evil series, or survivial horror fans who missed it when it first came out.8.5/10 "

												9.5/10Would look up Ashley's skirt with my Semi-Automatic Rifle againThis is a great PC port of Resident Evil 4 and i recommend buying it.60 FPS, updated textures, some new content depending when you first played RE4.Only gripes (not big, very minor)that i have are as follows:-A small slowdown in animation when reloading the Semi-Automatic Rifle-Slowdown of entire game when you go from your inventory back to the game too quickly (not too common)-Some problems with animations cutting off and making the game unplayable when emulating an XBox 360 controller on a Dualshock 4 (DS4) controller (My fault, i don't expect devs to fix emulation 3rd party software but something to be aware of. I'll list how to fix if this gets any comments asking)Other than that, the game is great and i really do recommend it until we get a Resident Evil 4 Remake in 5 years.			"

												I am gonna do a simple pros and cons review for this legendary game.Pros:-1. Gunplay which is extremely responsive and precise. You can even go to new game plus runs where you carry over your old weapons .While this makes the game easy yet it is satisfying to kill that boss which gave you so much trouble previously.2. Movement schemes which to some may seem hindering yet the pacing of the enemies make it viable.3. Separate ways and Assignment ada which are both excellent and show the story from a different perspective.4. The mercenaries. This is truly an amazing mode for RE4. You get to play as Leon,Ada,Hunk,Krauser and Wesker in 5 challenge maps. These give a new flavour to the gameplay and playing as Hunk ,Wesker or Krauser is extremely enjoyable.5.Boss fights. Some of the boss fights in this game are truly epic. The bosses are well balanced and can be taken down by simple handgun or a single shot rocket launcher .6. Weapons. No weapon is bad. The puny handgun you get at the beginning can help you till the end of the game. Even weapons which aren't considered good like mine thrower can be used effectively.7. This game isn't newbie friendly. You will have to give time and even then you will die alot. You'll have to give it time and learn to play.Cons:-1. Quick time events and button mash events are never a good thing.2. The Story is nice but the appearence of Ada as the mysterious lady and the age old cliched dialogues are not sweet on my ears.3. The performance can be a mixed bag for many. The graphics aren't that great and the 30/60fps cap occasionally slows down the game.Overall i'd say it is an amazing game although this port and the previous one leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance.

Simply perfectI have been playing RE4 since 2005, and ten years later this game still kicks major a$$.Very involved storyline, great soundtrack, an assortment of dope weapons, and groundbreaking visuals for its time. If you played the original PC version of this game (and you know how crappy it was), you will feel compensated with this HD remaster.The graphics are now more crisp, and trading cards along with achievements are a nice'n'sweet cherry on top of the cake. Having played this on the PS2 most of my life, the default joystiq controls for PC seemed quite uncomfortable, however installing a mod by DarkSamus fixed everything like a charm, so no problem there.To conclude,  this is a very solid game with loads of things to do, very solid HD remaster, and the price tag on this is more than reasonable.

												Shinji Makami's last game he made of resident evil, this is a great game a perfect mixture of survival/horror and action, although i am more of a fan of the classics re1-3 becuase there was more tension and survival aspects, this game still is rated close behind them in my book its deffi better then re5-re6. The port doesn't seem that terrible as everyone says, the controls are decent for keyboard and mouse compared to what i hear about it, but also i havent played very long yet though. I really cannot say i like the idea of the controlled enemies by las plagas while its a cool idea in theory i thought the regular zombies produced alot more fear, also the soundtrack is just decent compared to the ones dones in re2 re3. but this is coming from a huge fan of the classic RE games.

												Resident Evil, such a classic series! This one differs greatly from the ones that came before. Instead of having a partner who can fight with you or at least take care of themselves..you have Ashley, the president's daughter who excels at ruining your day. Seriously girl, pick up a damn stick and start swinging! I enjoyed this game, but it got a whole lot better when she wasn't there for some parts. It's a good experience if you love the series, and even if you haven't played any Resident Evils before, give this one a go! 7/10 ( because Krauser and Ashley need to be deleted from existance >.> )			"

Although you still have that as an option in the menu if you prefer the classic control.I would have preferred updated 3rd person - current controls full out as in, the ability to run and shoot. But you get used to it.Very fun, very scary. One of my favorite games of all times .. !			"

A must-play at this point, RE4 even holds its mettle against modern games in its genre.A long involved campaign, plenty of weapons and items to upgrade/use, intense bosses, and a wide variety of enemies keep RE4 a riveting game from beginning to end. In my opinion, the greatest Resident Evil game, and a top 5 in its genre. Highly recommend. "

												The most impressive thing about RE4, and what the sequels so miserably failed to recreate, was the progression of designed enemy encounters as you go through the game. In many action games before and after RE4, the developers seem to be struggling to find a gameplay loop that is fun for the player. If ""something fun"" is found, the instinct is to repeat the success over the entire game. Many successful action games are designed like this, and the best ones manage to use graphics, story, and positive feedback mechanisms such as collectibles to mask the repetition for the player. Another common strategy to mask repetition is to mix up the successful gameplay loop with scripted sequences that give the impression that gameplay is changing, when you are actually just pressing buttons to progress through interactive cutscenes.On the other end of the spectrum, you have a few game series that are not designed with the described ""repeat success"" mindset. A particularly rare philosophy is when a developer sees a successful gameplay loop as a starting point, and tries to introduce new successful loops through an entire game. The ""moment of fun"" is explored and investigated from every interesting angle, but after that it is time to move on to the next thing. The problem is, developing games according to this philosophy requires really talented people, lots of time and huge piles of money. Nintendo is the the only reliable producer of these type of games, with the 3d Mario series and the Legend of Zelda games.And that brings us to RE4. RE4 was developed with exactly the type of mindset that makes the Mario and Zelda games so unique. It was a revelation to play a third person shooter, or for that matter any type of shooting game, that explored enemy encounters to their fullest potential, but then briskly moved on to the next thing. There was no ""trickery"" to give a fake sense of gameplay progression. There were no ""reskinned"" levels with the same challenges. There was no overabundance of scripted sequences. There was no reliance on story to motivate the player to go through boring gameplay. Instead of this, the game had a string of perfectly tuned enemy encounters, where almost every one brought something new to the table. However, RE4 did not just provide variation from one encounter to the next, but it also unified the encounters with a strong sense of progression, which it arguably did even better than the aforementioned Nintendo games. The increased player agency from finding weapons, pesos and buying upgrades were almost perfectly tuned against the challenge level in RE4, which made it so depressing to play RE5 (or RE6) where they just didn't care due to the impossibility of balancing coop anyway.

												Overall, the game is very faithful to the original.  In some ways, I would say a bit too faithful.While the graphics are decent and smooth.  Your controls are locked unless you are willing to change the settings file directly and there is no way to setup a mouse look.So you are stuck with the same ""Tank"" style control method you used on the playstation 2 regardless of if you are using a Keyboard and Mouse or a Controller with no way to change it to a more modern style which basically just makes the game more difficult for difficulties sake which is more frustrating than anything unless you want to relearn an old control style that most games ditched years ago.So, if you use the mouse to pan to your right and go to shoot, when you pull out your gun, you aren't aiming where you are looking on your screen, you are aiming straight infront of your character at whatever is off-screen in that direction.Other than the dated and frustrating control style, it actually seems very well done from what little I have played so far.Also 1080p resolution & 60 FPS which really nice			"

												Beat the old PC version many times, I would say that this remake sure has some huge jump in graphical detail. The rendering and color tone is still similar, but high quality textures as well as the 60 FPS do make the game look way more smooth and polished than the original PC release. I applied 60 FPS mod also enhanced texture, even ENB profile to the old PC release, and I don't think it look as good as this. I am really satisfied with this game even though it costed 20 bucks. The in engine cutscenes was what I desired for a long time. Only down part for me is that, I am really used to the keyboard control in the old release(might sound silly), but since this game is semi keyboard/mouse and does not let you to go full keyboard, I have to learn the controlling mechanism again(not a bad thing at all for newer players though).

												I can handle the dated tank controls, kind of sloppy aiming, and other problems with a game as old as RE4. I cannot, however, handle the game running like sloppy♥♥♥♥♥on a rig that should be able to run it with a fair amount of ease.Resident Evil 4 is an amazing game, but the PC port is sloppy and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as they come. You'd think Bethesda did the port with how badly it's done. As much as I love this game, I cannot recommend it on PC. If you really want it, buy a Gamecube and play it on that. Or a Wii. Or a PS2. Or...It's been rereleased enough there's no excuse for it to be so terrible.			"

												I've played the Gamecube version, the Wii version, and now the PC version to absolute completion, and it's still a fantastically fun game to play. It's just the right amount of spooky and grotesque, and also manages to be a fun shooter. I don't think the HD textures are enough of an update to justify the purchase if you have other versions, but if you haven't played it before, its certainly worth picking up. My last note is the controller support is awesome, and it feels better to play this game with an Xbox controller as opposed to the others (Gamecube, Wii, or Mouse & Keyboard).			"

												Long overdue. Game is released in the proper version finally. It feels very good, I was afraid I remember it well and that maybe I should not touch it... But I was clearly wrong, it has better mood than current RE games and is by far better than RE6 or 5. Combat is pretty challanging and the only things that can still annoy in PC version is no mouse free look (so you basically play with keyboard and use mouse only to aim or shift camera view while standing - it is actually harder to operate when you move it while moving). This is still a small issue that dissapears fast enough, when you forget the recent RE habits. Can't say about any RE games that they were scary, but this is probably the only one where you STILL feel the tension and danger at all, which brings back nostalgia.The weapon and items systems are very rewarding and I like the ability to choose weapons and upgrade them. While game is still great, this release should have happened a long time ago, BUT If you didn't play any RE games and wonder if you should get this or RE6, than I tell you - get RE4. I'm a big fan of the WHOLE franchise, including ALL the games and the movies (+anime), but I honestly think this is the better game. For me it's just after Code Veronica. (I even have Resident Evil: Chronicles on ps3, Wesker FTW :P)			"

												Gotta say it is pretty great to play this game again but I can not recommend it for people who run on low end computers/laptops with integrated graphics cards .... Friendly advice if you are experience what is called the slow - mo glitch is to reduce the texture quality, shadows, ect and reduce you video resolution.With that out of the way ....This game is ... for the lack of a better word a unicorn .... everything about the game that looks good on paper some how managed to work here .... now with that said this game isn't for everyone, even on easy this game isn't a pushover if you are performing very well. Every fight will have you constantly thinking on your feet and having you really think about ammo managment .... (which to be fair ammo isn't TOOO sparse if you know what you're doing).  I will say that this isn't completely Dark Souls level of brutal unless you have decided to do a professional (the hardest difficulty for RE 4). There are a ton of unlockables LOADS of replay value to this game and more often than not you might've  missed a few things on subsequent playthroughs, its just one of those types of games which seem quiet rare in todays era where singleplayer games are more often than not fairly short .... only to have a serious focus on multiplayer which is a shame really ...Also well ... for how good this game was this game also marks the Decline in the RE franchise from  survival horror games with Some elements of action to full on action adventure blockbusters that .... faceplant out the door. (However I've heard RE 5 wasn't too bad but 6 and the others suffer from a bloated cast of returning characters and plot ....)Anyways with that all said ... I suggest you take that lockpick kit and keep it with you ....since you're the master of unlocking...har har har.			"

												I never played Resident evil 4 until 2016 so i'm qualified to give an honest review without nostalgia burden on my shoulders. I'm however familiar to the series and played resident evils 1, 2 & 3 on playstation in the 90's.Resident evil 4 is really fun and challenging to play. Constant presure of low suplies makes you think your decisions everytime as there are many ways to deal with your enemies. The pacing of the game is made perfect: new monsters, weapons, characters, areas and bosses apears right when you need one. Never felt bored while playing and that's not something i can say with every AAA-game.The whole game world is weird in pretty much every way. Characters are strange and their actions during cutscnenes are sometimes just ridiculous. Mysterious merchants keep their shops in every empty hole you can find in the area. Village looks poor but every shelf is filled with jewels, gold coins and bars. Leon can jump 20 meters straight down without even hurting a toe (physics doesn't seems to apply in this game) . I'm not saying all this is a bad thing and i laugh all game long.There are four problems with RE 4, none of them are gamebreaking yet all of them are annoying while playing. You can minimaze controls + inventory issues by playing with a controller. Unfortnunetely I don't have one. - Controls are really clunky and slow to respond. The lake scene is almost unplayable with mouse+keyboad as it is really hard to aim the harpoon.- Inventory management is really frustrating as you can't use mouse when moving items on your inventory screen. Managing your inventory space is really important in this game and you are moving items all the time.- Some of the wall and cliff textures looks ugly. Just pure laziness by the developers... all character models are made excelent.- no subtitles during cutscenes. You can find subtitles section in options but it can't be activated for some reason.Despite all the flaws resident evil 4 is entertaining package with hours of fun. Definitely worth checking out even today if you missed this title back in the days like i did. 10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												10/10 Highly recommended!I've purchased this game a total of 7 times across 5 different platforms(GameCube, PS2, Xbox360, Wii and PC).This game is amazing. I first played it back in 2005 on my brother's GameCube and I was hooked forever(even though I was stuck at the same part up until 2006).The primary reason this game get's a 10/10 from me is because it's a nostalga trip through and through.It has held FIRST PLACE on my favorite games of all time list since 2005(beating Halo and Half-Life2).Pros:+ Graphics have aged amazingly+ A near perfect inventory system(personal opinion)+ A lot of fun little puzzles+ Scary enemy introductions+ Lovable characters(that's including enemies)+ Cheesy story, but in a good way+ The Merchant(Buy weapons, health sprays, maps, armor, larger inventory cases, etc.)+ Stylish costumes(Especially the ""Special 2"" costume)+ The files, letters and notes are all good reads that explain everything going on in the game.+ Beautiful soundtrack(that I still listen to)+ Main campaign, Separate Ways(second campaign), Assignment Ada, Mercenaries.Pro/Con(some people will like, others will hate)(compared to the previous titles):+/- Over the shoulder camera instead of fixed camera+/- More action based+/- The game that changed the series+/- Unlimited saving(still uses a typewriter though)+/- The Merchant SystemCons:- Controls have not aged very well- Can't move while shooting- Not nearly as scary as previous RE titlesIt's an overall fun time and I'd suggest trying it out.If I think of more, I'll add to the list.*NOTE* I've seen a few negative reviews from people saying that the game is laggy and just a bad port overall...I can confirm this is inccorrect. The game runs at 60fps smoothly on my dated PC.			"

												Resident Evil 4. One of my favorite games and one of the best games of all time. Perfectly paced, tight controls, brilliant story and excellent characters. Needless to say, when I saw this was coming to steam I preordered it on the spot. I have the game on every other system it's come out on, so why not the computer. I mean what could go wrong, it's just a port to the pc. Well, I would say something major went wrong. They locked the fps at 60.the game runs fine, perfectly even, I'm getting the sixty frames per second as advertised. However the cost of this is that the game runs in bullet time. I get to see every frame of every animation in the game. Unless it decides to stop doing that at random intervals which result in the el gigante puching me in my face and/or smashing me into the ground. To be honest if this was just in the gameplay segments I wouldn't have a problem with it, but it's in the cutscenes. Every signle one of them. This issue may seem to be a minor gripe, however lets take a look at this from the point of view of someone who had never played the game before. They have heard so much about this game and are now finally able to play it since it's on the computer. They buy it and load it up. Now if their copy has the same issue as mine, the first thing they are going to notice is that in the openingcutscene the audio desyncs from the video. ""it's just a glitch."" they say as they continue forward. Once the cutscenes over, they get set adn start heading playing. Only to find that every step takes a second and a half and that the game seems to now be Max Payne having a fever dream. ""could just be the game map loading in."" So the player gets to the first house and gets another desynced cut scene. Than when it finishes the very first enemy starts lumbering over to you in slow motion. You raise you gun and prpare to fire, when the game speeds up and goes at the proper speed. Next thing the first time player knows the villager is upon them and hacking their face off with a scythe. continue this porcess though out the game. Every time the cutscenes desync it reminds you that your playing a game and takes you out of the setting and narrative. No matter how much the games trys to set the mood again, it just doesn't stay. The broken out of sync cutscenes, the enemies playing red light green light, and the in ability to see the world in anything other than bullet time destroys this games power. You are no longer able to connect with the characters or feel for their struggle. You sit terrified that the game will speed up when facing an enemy that can one shot you, and may even find your self having trouble with quick time events where failure means death and possiby watching a cutscene over.

												To its current state, i do not recommend the game at all.Slow motion bugs (which you can fix, but its annoying to restrain all the graphical options)Audio DesyncGrenades don't explode at all, literally.You can't kick down the doors in the first village.When you make a second port for a computer you're suppose to make it better than the previous one, not worst. I still have the first port to the PC and it's much better than this crap. For months since this has been released, i've seen no improvement what so ever and this is just a way for capcom to suck the money out of its customers. Thanks a lot.			"

												Resident Evil 4 is pretty good, I guess.Leon is the biggest dïck G ever. In Resident Evil 2 he was like an awkward teenager but now he's a badass super dude.Ashley looks like she's 14 but she's equipped with the assets of a 25-year old, that's a pretty good description of Ashley.Everything else in the game is rock solid but then you meet Ashley who is basically an anime girl from one of Liam's waifu games.Luis is some Spanish bàstard who is pretty smooth with the lady people. Though I think he's homosexual.Saddler is the lamest villain ever, his plan is the worst and his name is pretty lame for a Big Boss.Salazar is like 12-years old, even though he's 20. He's like Squeaky-voiced teen.Krauser is like some guy who Leon knew once but you, the player, wouldn't know about him if you hadn't played the worst Resident Evil ever.This game is pretty good, I've probably beaten it like 25 times.

												People have been going on about how Resident Evil 4 is one of the best games ever made. On the GameCube this might have been the case, but this port to PC is certainly not. The graphics are what you would expect, but for an HD remodel, it kinda looks the same to be quite honest. The controls are horrid for a keyboard and mouse.  They also kept the static camera, giving a feel of the general game being blocky and unfinished. To add insult to injury there is NO 'additional exclusive content' as advertised in the description. It was good on the GameCube, Waste of $20 on the PC. 4/10. (also some steam achievements do not work)			"

												Resident Evil 4. One of my favorite games and one of the best games of all time. Perfectly paced, tight controls, brilliant story and excellent characters. Needless to say, when I saw this was coming to steam I preordered it on the spot. I have the game on every other system it's come out on, so why not the computer. I mean what could go wrong, it's just a port to the pc. Well, I would say something major went wrong. They locked the fps at 60.the game runs fine, perfectly even, I'm getting the sixty frames per second as advertised. However the cost of this is that the game runs in bullet time. I get to see every frame of every animation in the game. Unless it decides to stop doing that at random intervals which result in the el gigante puching me in my face and/or smashing me into the ground. To be honest if this was just in the gameplay segments I wouldn't have a problem with it, but it's in the cutscenes. Every signle one of them. This issue may seem to be a minor gripe, however lets take a look at this from the point of view of someone who had never played the game before. They have heard so much about this game and are now finally able to play it since it's on the computer. They buy it and load it up. Now if their copy has the same issue as mine, the first thing they are going to notice is that in the openingcutscene the audio desyncs from the video. ""it's just a glitch."" they say as they continue forward. Once the cutscenes over, they get set adn start heading playing. Only to find that every step takes a second and a half and that the game seems to now be Max Payne having a fever dream. ""could just be the game map loading in."" So the player gets to the first house and gets another desynced cut scene. Than when it finishes the very first enemy starts lumbering over to you in slow motion. You raise you gun and prpare to fire, when the game speeds up and goes at the proper speed. Next thing the first time player knows the villager is upon them and hacking their face off with a scythe. continue this porcess though out the game. Every time the cutscenes desync it reminds you that your playing a game and takes you out of the setting and narrative. No matter how much the games trys to set the mood again, it just doesn't stay. The broken out of sync cutscenes, the enemies playing red light green light, and the in ability to see the world in anything other than bullet time destroys this games power. You are no longer able to connect with the characters or feel for their struggle. You sit terrified that the game will speed up when facing an enemy that can one shot you, and may even find your self having trouble with quick time events where failure means death and possiby watching a cutscene over. I'm looking at you krauser. Overall a very dissapointing port to the pc and I hope that a patch comes out soon to fix this horrific mark on an outstanding game.			"

												I am a long time Resident Evil (And Survival horror fan alike). This wasn't my first RE but it was one I have enjoyed emensly to this day. I've bought it 3 times (GC, WII, now PC).. Of the versions I bought this is the worst version I have gotten, the audio cuts out you absolutely can not play it without a controller, the 60 FPS are nice until you hit quick time events and have to turn it off. But worst of all is the actual way it plays in some areas, I get absolutly terrible FPS..Im going to buy it a 4th time but for my Xbox one which will atleast work. I am disapointed that such a good game got terrible treatement.			"

												FALSE ADVERTISING ALERTIf you have a mobile graphics card, AVOID THIS PORT AT ALL COSTS. The game is horrifically optimized, and cannot run above a stutter on my machine. Note, this is a laptop that can run a majority of modern games at a solid 30-to-60 fps on med-high settings. But for this port of a game from 2004 - I am SOL. I can hopefully push 30 frames per second at the bare-minimum of settings, running like molasses. It is Capcom's duty to inform potiental consumers of potiental incomapitibility between their software and consumer hardware, which they have failed to do in this game's System Requirements section. As I am far from the only user to experience this slowdown (observing the Steam Community page, which highlights many other issues among laptop users), it's unlikely that Capcom is also ignorant to the issue.

												This game is one of the best survival horror games i have ever played, But this port is dead and needs fixing.Good* Aiming with the mouse feels great, even at close range.* Wide arrange of Weapons and tactical equipment.* Best Partner A.I i have ever seen. (Gives you commands on if they should stay or follow.)* Bosses are fun and creepy.* Sounds in this game are great (When they work.)* The story is great.Bad* Game only launches properly when you go through steam. (No desktop shortcuts and if you do there's crashes and no sound.)* Game won't even run the HD VERSION YOU BUY THE GAME FOR PROPERLY, MASSIVE CRASHES AND AUDIO IS UNSYNCED. (Barely works on original graphics and it's not my Pc's fault.)* Sound bugs out randomly and sounds terrible. (Gunshot sounds and background tracks will mess up a lot.)* Achievements sometimes messes up and won't award them, Usually crashes before awarding them.Overall if you're going to buy this game i recommend it, Just buy the original or if they ever release a proper Pc port.

												A great revival of an awesome game.New lighting effects. Enhanced Textures. Extra added details. 3 new post processing effects (B&W and 2 other color effects). Improved controls. Faster loading times. This is what the original RE4 should have been.But it's good to see the devs took their time to make a great revival in the Steam version. I was really surprised to see it wasn't just another re-release with thrown in HD textures.I posted comparison photos between the Steam version and Retail Disc version (modified with HD Textures) for you to see in my Facebook game community here:https://www.facebook.com/gamergenkisanThis is definitely a must have for any Resident Evil fan. :)			"

												A little story time:When capcom released RE7, I was thrilled. When I saw the price, I was...less thrilled. Especially after I saw footage of the whole game. It wasn't worth the money to me, especially not when the entire game felt like an autistic lovechild of Outlast and F.E.A.R That's when i decided to re-buy all the old RE games or at least those available on steam. This game was the very first game i ever played on the Wii, when the console came out. Let me tell you, lil 9 year old me was terrified of this game.The graphics were THE♥♥♥♥♥♥back then, even if it looks outdate for todays standards.But hear me out - the athmosphere created in this game is still phenomenal, even if the graphics are, yes, outdated. It's dark and dull, washed out colors, the sounds are authentic, gross and fit perfectly to the situations. The dialogues are cheesy af, but thats a common thing in resident evil games! The voiceacting is pretty great as well, compared to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ robotic voiceover in RE5 ( not to mention RE6, yuck! )I've seen people complaining about the controls and how stiff and unresponsive they are - but let me tell you, the Wii version was stiff and unresponsive too, even WITH motion controls, besides I am convinced that stiff controls are simply a part of the experience, just like Tomb Raider. I personally got used to the controls pretty fast, especially since most enemies move at a pace of 5 meters per hour anyway, and are not much of a problem to deal with once you get the hang of it. They are pretty satisfying to shoot down too, also there are variations in enemies and enemy behaviours, which I missed in RE7.I know some hardcore fans of the games say that RE4 is a bad game compared to the previous games, and it just might be my nostalgia speaking here, but i still love this game, even if it does have its flaws. I still play it though, and i'll always consider it the first game that got me interested in both third person and first person shooter games. "

												One of the worst PC Ports I've ever purchased. Everything from the Frame Rate to the Audio, to the responsiveness are broken. Audio cuts out, smooth 60FPS for 15 seconds with 5 seconds of 2-3FPS in between. Lots of people getting these problems with little in the way of fixing, outside of trying several different graphics cards.Great game altogether. The controls are a little out there, but if you can get past that, you can have allot of fun.I HIGHLY recommend you play the Wii, Gamecube, or Playstation 2 version (Wii is best if you can configure your controller for it) via Dolphin or similar emulator. It's not as graphically enchanced but that doesn't matter because now you can actually play the game!			"

												Updating this review to reflect that I have found a solution for my problems, which was that this game was using the Integrated Graphics on my system by default instead of the high-performance graphics card. I was able to fix the slowdown issues by changing the settings in the nvidia control panel as instructed in the forums for this game.Now that that's fixed, this game is a much better version for the PC than the original port. Resident Evil 4 remains perhaps the best entry in the Resident Evil series to date. The controls feel a little clunky compared to newer entries like RE 5 and 6, but that's not really a fault of this updated vrersion.All that said, Capcom still needs to patch this game to be aware of cards that have the dual-mode feature. No other game I have has this problem of needing to manually set it to use the NVidia card instead of the integrated graphics controller.			"

												I am quite a fan of old Resident Evil series. Been playing first, second and third parts long time ago in my childhood and this part was a gamechanger for me. Let me explain myself... The game by itself is good, there are horror elements, interactive movies when you press a button at the right moments, puzzles, scarse ammo and you have to choose wisely what do you need and what you don't. BUT... This game marked for me the end of the Resident Evil series the way I used to know it. Not it's more of a shooter and less of a horror survival. Still a okay game series, it's enjoyable. Just not quite the same as it used to be.			"

												The story takes place 6 years after the Raccoon City incident where a viral outbreak happened by a company called Umbrella. You are Leon S. Kennedy one of the survivors of the incident. Now hired by the government as an high-ranking officer, he is sent to rescue the kidnapped Daughter of the president, Ashley Graham. While searching you will encounter alot of enemies and uncover an evil plot that could change the face of the world as we know it. The environments in this game are good-rendered and retain a singular ""spooky"" ambiance throughout. The character models are clear and crisp, with minimal faults in animation.The music suits the game, it flows well with the ambiance of each area. Sound effects are well-done also.Resident Evil 4 takes around 10-15 hours to complete. After you have completed the main game you are rewarded with three extra game modes. Separate Ways serves to delve deeper into the plotline of the game, taking you deeper into the story and showing the player that not everything that occurs throughout is coincidental. Assignment Ada plays much like the main game as well. The Mercenaries is a mini game where the player has to kill enemies to earn points before the evacuation chopper arrives in the allotted time. By completing these extra game modes, weapons become available in the main game and Separate Ways, coercing the player into numerous replays in order to obtain all of them.If you do not already own Resident Evil 4, I can highly recommend that you buy it. This game can easily be enjoyed again and again.Sounds 9/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												The game that redefined the third-person shooter genre, Resident Evil 4 is the perfect blend of modern-day action and classic survival horror. Originally released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2004, Resident Evil 4 has aged exceptionally well. The mechanics do not feel outdated, and the graphics are sharp without appearing visually painful as has been the case with some other HD re-releases on Steam. Even ten years after release, Resident Evil 4 will still command your attention! Highly recommended!			"

												OK, first off --- IF YOU'RE USING A MOUSE AND KEYBOARD YOUR GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME.At first I was disappointed because the pc controls were very poor. Luckily I had a wired xbox 360 controller around and used that. If you use a controller you shouldn't have any problems whatsoever. I Beat this a bunch of times and unlocked everything on the PS2 back in the day. If you never got around to playing the Resident Evil franchise, you should probably pick this one up. This is one of the good ones. It looks pretty good for how old it is, and the plot is solid. For some reason, there are only 12 achievements for this game. As a regular CS GO player, this is quite weak considering CS GO has 167 achievements. Also I forgot how annoying Ashley is when she screams ""LEON!"", and the merchant only has a handful of sayings.Overall it's good. I'll admit that $20 is a bit steep for a 10 year old game, but the price will drop with time.8/10			"

												Resident Evil 4 took the franchise to a different level of survival horror and action. The campaign itself is relatively long and features Leon Scott Kennedy, a fan favorite character from Resident Evil 2. The gameplay itself was a drastic improvement from previous titles in the series, abandoning the fixed camera angles and switching to a 3rd person view. Another feature added into the mix was a grid based inventory system, which sometimes forced the player to make some decisions when it came down to being low on space. Aiming a weapon is easier than ever thanks to laser sights, and becomes more challenging as you progress farther into the story. Ammunition can be scarse during the beginning, but becomes more available later on. Your mission is to rescue the president's daughter from a mysterious group, and survive the nightmare that awaits you. Not only will you need to protect yourself, but also Ashley from the hordes of enemies you will face. Along the way you will collect gold which can be used in exchange for weapons and upgrades that will greatly help you get through the whole story. Resident Evil 4 is by far a masterpiece, and still shines after its original release on the Nintendo Gamecube. If your a fan of survival horror, and have yet to play Resident Evil 4, what are you waiting for? You know what your buying next, and certainly not at a high price, for $19.99, it's a wise chose.

												It's Resident Evil 4.My only real gripe with this version is the mouse controls. It is WAY wonky, to the point where Leon will sometimes flail all over the screen if you turn the mouse too quickly while raising or lowering your gun. You'll inevitably run into this problem at several points in the game, and you WILL die at least once 'cause of it.Other gripes include: no ability to legitimately exit out of the game once in one, you have to Alt+F4 to exit out.

If you haven't played Resident Evil 4 in a long time, this is a good pick. If you want a reminder of what the only good game in the series was, this is a good pick.Otherwise, this is pretty much just another obligatory Capcom cash grab.			"

												So many people have probably already played this, but it is still so good. So tense and challenging, while still being fun. Hilarious and over the top melodrama in the plot, but if you know Resident Evil, you expect that and probably love the silliness of it all. My only gripe is the Quicktime events. I HATE THEM. Not just in this game, but any game. There are some things with the controls that feel super dated, but once you accept that it is part of the challenge, it's not hard to get past it. It is so worth playing again.			"

												English:Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition is quite a self-describing title: it is probably the best Resident Evil 4 version ever released, adapted at its best for modern gaming PCs. At the same time, it fails in providing something new for those who played the original, and for newcomers to the Resident Evil saga it will probably be something unappealing due to the deprecated gameplay mechanics.Italian:Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition tiene fede alla parola di essere, probabilmente, la migliore edizione di Resident Evil 4 mai creata, donandogli tutti i comfort di un gioco odierno ma senza snaturarne l’impatto originale. Al contempo, questo suo pregio è anche il suo peggior difetto: ora come ora, non c’è davvero alcun motivo per voler spendere 20 euro sull’ennesimo rifacimento di un gioco che gli appassionati avranno sicuramente già giocato e che i neofiti non sarebbero in grado di apprezzare. Da prendere solo ed esclusivamente se fate parte di questa seconda categoria ma siete in grado di andare oltre alle apparenze e adeguarvi al sistema di controllo. E, con un po’ di fortuna, sarà davvero l’ultima edizione.Leggete qui la recensione completa: http://www.gamesource.it/resident-evil-4-resident-evil-4-hd-pc/ "

												Resident Evil 4 on Steam is still the same fantastic game it was on the Nintendo Gamecube almost a decade ago, albeit with a couple of technical quirks. This mostly has to deal with the new option to adjust the game's framerate from the previous 30 to a silky 60 frames per second. While this works fine about 90-95% of the time, due to the game originally being coded to run at 30fps, cutscene dialogue will de-sync, some particle effects will disappear early, and most damning, timing for the game's many QTEs (notably the ""mash"" actions) are adjusted significantly. Again, the rest of the game is fine, but if you're looking to sit back and watch the cutscenes, or you're stuck on a QTE sequence, you might be better off leaving that setting alone.			"

Quick Intro:Welcome to the World of Leon S. Kennedy, one of the greatest Zombie survivors and characters in all of Resident Evil, play him as he fights his way through another Virus called the Plagas where he will verse a Village of seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of Zombies, Creatures and (Pedos) I mean Very powerful Villains who kidnap little girls Who is the President’s Daughter. Graphics:From when this was created is was my favourite and at top rank with Final Fantasy X. The graphics and scenarios as well as cinematic were outstanding, as you wonder into the abyss and unknown terrains you can admire some beautiful scenes and really appreciate the games developed as it’s taken from the previous games from 1-3. With the Characters, bosses and the way the texture was layed out I would give it top marks.Game play:This game will have you on the edge of your seat and will test you reflexes to the max as you fight of Villages and guys with Potato Sacks on their head, Which when you hear the noise will get you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your panties if you don’t know what’s to come or even if you still do. If you were a controller player then its pretty standard with the aiming and shooting and activation buttons and will take time to switch to keyboard and mouse and vice-versa. This game give you tons of puzzles, characters backgrounds, random Enemies and an amazing new way of carrying items as you are given a suitcase to carry out your items and Weapons.The fun doesn’t even stop there. After completing the game you have the chance to continue the story as you play with Ada Wong in her story line. And Mercenaries as where you get to play with many Characters Such as Krauser, HUNK and ALBERT ♥♥♥♥ING WESKER (THE LEGEND OF ALL VILLAINS)Advantage:This game will challenge even the best of players and as the Story-line continues on Leon S. Kennedy you will not be disappointed in any of the game, with funny Quotes, Merchants who you will love/hate.There are Special Figures and bonus packs which come with the game so no add that’ll keep the game interesting and with surprises around every corner you will always be happy with this game.Disadvantage:The only things I truly believe that’ll frustrate you, would be the Ai as sometimes it’s hard to try and command Ashley to do what you want in certain situations that would probably get you killed as she runs towards the danger because she found weed...I mean Herbs.Overall:I do believe this is my favourite Resident Evil game and has been for a very long time, with everything from the story-line, Cinematic, game play, and the way the game was structured. I would give this game my 10/10 this is including all the flaws.This is Hands Down the best Resident Evil game in my Opinion and I do believe those who are Resident Evil Fan would also agree with me too.Thank you for reading and Peace Out.

												One of my favourite games of all time. Redefined survival horror into something I actually wanted to play. Always hated the static camera of the older games. Super atmospheric, interesting characters, creepy enemies, epic bosses and awesome weapons that feel so great to wield. I've had it on the Gamecube, Wii and now PC. Graphically speaking this is the best of the bunch. Otherwise playing on the Wii with the wiimote was the superior experience. It just fit so well. Mouse and keyboard does a decent job though. I've found it better than using a controller at least. All the issues they had at launch seem to be gone now. Game looks great and runs at a solid 60fps. Highly recommended!			"

												Great game from start to finish. The only thing that brings it down is the Quick Time Events which have no place in a game like this, it doesn't help that they change constantly as well which can lead to multiple deaths, I probably died more to them then actual zombie / boss fights.Upon completion you unlock:A new difficulty 'Professional' New weapons for the playthrough.Under the extra tab missions unlock where you can play as 'Ada Wong' and see her side of the story. Mercenary Mode.I haven't dabbled too much into the extra content yet, but there is plenty of content here for your money.I completed it using a 360 controller and had no issues with the controls.

												I played RE4 on the Nintendo Game Cube for many years, and i fell in love with what i would consider; the last REAL RE game.  Now that I own it on the PC in HD, I am absolutely in love again.  This game has lots of action and an enthralling storyline that will captivate your imagination to the fullest.  The graphics are gorgeous.  Those that are experiencing problems with HD should just tweak with their video settings in the game.  No big deal.  It also helps if you have a high end graphics card (which i do have).  You're gaming people; start upgrading your hardware for goodness sake.  I had this issue only when recording my action scenes on 60 FPS.  It's my recorder that has a problem, not the game itself.  Once i lowered it to 30 FPS, i had no problems with video and audio synching together.  Without recording, I can up the FPS once again and my game runs just as smoothly as before.  As far as the controls, well, I use the 360 Controller, and it does take some getting used to.  But once you get the hang of it, you're gonna be kicking butt.  No regrets here folks.  I highly recommend this game to all hardcore RE fans out there.			"

Oh and how utterly useless Ashley is. But I think that's been said too many times. Overall: Pick it up, this is the definitive version of Resident Evil 4.

												Resident Evil 4 is a highly classic game, originally released in 2005. Resident Evil 4 has epic boss fights, awesome cutscenes, and that needy girl, Ashley. You play as U.S. Agent Leon Scott Kennedy. You have been sent to Europe to rescue the president's missing daughter. Upon arriving, You see a house and as you approach a peron in the window moves away. You enter the house, and ask the man a few questions. He then preceds to attack you. After you gun him down, A truck starts up and you hear the officers yelling. There are a few more guys outside you have to deal with. This was the very first moments of Resident Evil 4. You want the rest? Buy the game. 19.99 is a really good price.			"

												Old, fond memories. But that is about it for the experianced Resident Evil fan.If you're new to the Resident Evil franchise, this is a must have. Aside from setting the identity of the horror/action genre for video games since it's release in 2004, its a hell of an intense ride. Amazing atmosphere, amazing gore and guts, and some silly resident evil moments. But for the experianced RE4 gamer, this is just another port. Capcom has dressed it as a huge improvement, and a lot of times you can see it, but you don't feel it much at least. The controls for the Keyboard are slightly clunky, and (of course) for today's standards, some of the visuals/animations don't entirely stand up anymore. And as far as I can tell, the most they have added is a leaderboard to see who ran past the most ganados to beat the top time of completion.Those aside, it is a great nostalgic peice of terror, if it even can scare you any more. Worth a buy if you havn't played it, and maybe worth a buy if you have the cash laying around for the veteran.			"

												OK, first off --- IF YOU'RE USING A MOUSE AND KEYBOARD YOUR GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME.At first I was disappointed because the pc controls were very poor. Luckily I had a wired xbox 360 controller around and used that. If you use a controller you shouldn't have any problems whatsoever. I Beat this a bunch of times and unlocked everything on the PS2 back in the day. If you never got around to playing the Resident Evil franchise, you should probably pick this one up. This is one of the good ones. It looks pretty good for how old it is, and the plot is solid. For some reason, there are only 12 achievements for this game. As a regular CS GO player, this is quite weak considering CS GO has 167 achievements. Also I forgot how annoying Ashley is when she screams ""LEON!"", and the merchant only has a handful of sayings.Overall it's good. I'll admit that $20 is a bit steep for a 10 year old game, but the price will drop with time.8/10			"

Originally released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2004, Resident Evil 4 has aged exceptionally well. The mechanics do not feel outdated, and the graphics are sharp without appearing visually painful as has been the case with some other HD re-releases on Steam.

												Resident Evil 4 took the franchise to a different level of survival horror and action. The campaign itself is relatively long and features Leon Scott Kennedy, a fan favorite character from Resident Evil 2. The gameplay itself was a drastic improvement from previous titles in the series, abandoning the fixed camera angles and switching to a 3rd person view. Another feature added into the mix was a grid based inventory system, which sometimes forced the player to make some decisions when it came down to being low on space. Aiming a weapon is easier than ever thanks to laser sights, and becomes more challenging as you progress farther into the story. Ammunition can be scarse during the beginning, but becomes more available later on. Your mission is to rescue the president's daughter from a mysterious group, and survive the nightmare that awaits you. Not only will you need to protect yourself, but also Ashley from the hordes of enemies you will face. Along the way you will collect gold which can be used in exchange for weapons and upgrades that will greatly help you get through the whole story. Resident Evil 4 is by far a masterpiece, and still shines after its original release on the Nintendo Gamecube. If your a fan of survival horror, and have yet to play Resident Evil 4, what are you waiting for? You know what your buying next, and certainly not at a high price, for $19.99, it's a wise chose.

												It's Resident Evil 4.My only real gripe with this version is the mouse controls. It is WAY wonky, to the point where Leon will sometimes flail all over the screen if you turn the mouse too quickly while raising or lowering your gun. You'll inevitably run into this problem at several points in the game, and you WILL die at least once 'cause of it.Other gripes include: no ability to legitimately exit out of the game once in one, you have to Alt+F4 to exit out.

												ONE OF THE VERY BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME FINALLY GETS A GOOD (NOT GREAT) PC PORTIf you were already a serious gamer back in the mid-'00s, you probably consider RE4 as one of the most important games of all time. Just like Gears of War, RE4 helped redefine the action-adventure shooter genre; it was a wild 3rd-1st person shooter hybrid with SWEET sniper weapons and, while it wasn't a traditional '90s survival horror game, it featured many elements of previous RE games, and it was a scary, dark game (not as dark as RE2-3 though). Sadly, the original 2007 PC port suffered from average graphics/textures and a total lack of mouse support (making aiming a living hell, yet the game was playable once you LEARNED to aim with the A-W-S-D keys-EPIC!, lol). That means the GameCube / Wii versions were the ultimate ports of RE4...until now...NOW we have this RE4 HD revival, and FINALLY serious PC gamers have the opportunity to play this game with mouse support and good-to-great textures/graphics. BUT BEWARE!, this HD 2014 pc port suffers from two major (or minor, depending on how good your pc is) FLAWS:a) the game is playable, but needs a fix; I can play 2012-2013 games on high-to-ultra settings with no problems, but I HAVE to run RE4 HD without motion blur, anti-aliasing, and I'm forced to use 30 fps (not the 60 fps option), at least I can run it with the HD graphics, LOL!; but gamers with 2010-2011 computers will STRUGGLE to run this game even on low settings and without (!) the HD graphics---EDIT: GAME ALREADY FIXED AND WORKING LIKE A CHARM---b) the gameplay is EXACTLY the same as RE 5, that means you can't walk/run while aiming, and you can't really move with the mouse (too slow-awkward), so you'll have to stick with the A,W,S,D keys for movement. That kinda makes RE4 HD a bit old-school; those who were hoping for a Mass Effect 3/Resident Evil 6-like gameplay will be disappointed....final verdict: 8,5/10 (the original GameCube-Wii game remains a solid-historical 10/10)			"

												I am quite a fan of old Resident Evil series. Been playing first, second and third parts long time ago in my childhood and this part was a gamechanger for me. Let me explain myself... The game by itself is good, there are horror elements, interactive movies when you press a button at the right moments, puzzles, scarse ammo and you have to choose wisely what do you need and what you don't. BUT... This game marked for me the end of the Resident Evil series the way I used to know it. Not it's more of a shooter and less of a horror survival. Still a okay game series, it's enjoyable. Just not quite the same as it used to be.			"

												To me, this is one of the best games of all time. Very intense atmosphere, addictive gameplay, exciting boss fights, a lot of unlockables, and much more! I've already played through the previous PC version 4 times unlocking basically everything several years ago. I can't describe the feeling of getting more and more powerful with each playthough and the fun just grows stronger and stronger. I'm planning to have a few playthoughs of this new high res version. I want to at least unlock Thompson and rocket launcher, infinite ammo, and of course all the custumes.Although the previous PC port sucked and crashed on me every couple of hours, It couldn't stop me playing this amazing game! I managed to complete the Ada adventure, in which you cannot save. What happened was I played half way though, then it crash and I had to restart the adventure. I did this over and over again until I finished the adventure quick enough before it crashed on me again. This is how good the game is - even with crashing I still stuck to the very end.Mercenary mode is good too. Although it's not as good as the Mercenary mode in RE6, it all started from this game. So there is no reason not to give credit to it.This game is woth every cent it asks for. Stop reading reviews and get it NOW!			"

												Resident Evil 4Original Release: 2005 (Gamecube)Genre: Third Person Over the Shoulder (Inspiration for other great games with a similar angle), Horror.Game of the Year for Multiple Magazines & Websites in 2005 + Great Graphics (10/10)+ Fluent Controls for Controller AND Keyboard (9.5/10)+ Achievements & Trading Cards (NA)+ Well Developed Story/Gameplay (9/10)+ Very High Replay Value (9/10)Overall Rating: 9.5/10(All games aren't perfect, especially this one, the only complaint is that CAPCOM should have released a BETTER port on PC earlier)I strongly recommend this game to those who haven't played it before AND those who enjoy the series. What's not to love with running at 60 Frames Per Second? Pure HD graphics? Full controller support? This game IS a port that should have been done along while ago. However I'm finally relieved that they released a great port such as this one.			"

												One of the greatest video games ever made finally gets a (good) PC port.At its core, RE4 is a TPS with an over-the-shoulder view, and usually regarded as the game to introduce and popularize that camera setup. It mostly eschews the old horror trappings of the Resident Evil series for a more uptempo, ""action thriller"" pace, while nonetheless maintaining constant situational tension and classic ""survival"" mechanics such as a fleshed out inventory system and game-long resource and ammunition micromanagement. Spatial awareness and thinking on your feet are highly rewarded, and while deft aiming and accurate shooting can extricate you from sticky situations, you're bound to pay a dear price for being overaggressive or mindless of your approach. Tackling a room in a gung-ho, reactive, ""autopilot"" manner is sure to put even experienced players in some hot water. RE4 is the first mainline RE to be envisioned as a shooter, but it nonetheless still retains a large focus on finesse of movement, which is absolutely required for close-quarters combat and evasion. Melee finishers (usually prompted by the player's shooting of a specific spot of the enemy, such as the head or knee), and the myriad setups this shooting + finisher interplay can uncover present inventive players with endless combat opportunities. Two given RE4 playthroughs can and will vary wildly, and this is a game which will require multiple playthroughs to truly appreciate, understand and master.Highly challenging, packed with tons of content (the Mercenaries unlockable minigame is, in itself, nearly as addictive and compelling as the main game), secrets and esoteric techniques to be learned, RE4 is one of the finest action games ever made - a work of sheer genius whose excellence is, for my money, yet to be surpassed in the TPS genre.

												So I wanted to make this review a two or more part review. My first impressions and then later my overall opinion on the game. If you are reading this early on then you will only see my first impressions as im going to put more hours in before making part 2. Most of us purchasing this game have played it in the past. So to discuss its epic gameplay and cult following would likely leave me sounding like a broken record amongst other reviewers here. However like many here, I played this game years ago on gamecube and then had it for the Wii later on. It is in my opinion; one of the best games ever made. That along with Far Cry Instincts however im referring to the xbox version, I understand that the pc port seems to be different. Anyways back to Resident Evil. The only concerns are these, for starters we have the difficulty. This is a difficult game, this may not be a game for your twitch button smashing COD player, but more for your Skyrim player. You will need to be somewhat tactical regardless of what approach you take. The enemies usually require headshots and ammo is scarce. So walking in to the center of the crowd and firing off alot of rounds is going to maybe kill 2 enemies and the other 10 will no doubt slaughter you. The other concern is the only thing id call a drawback. The controlls are not good, I found its a little easier using an xbox one controller however I think it really just comes down to personal preference. They are clunky, its hard to aim as well as look around. When you pair this up with the difficulty of this game your walking into some dangerous waters. However you seem to learn to get used to the controlls and they become functional. As of right now I see the issue to be nothing more than a beginning of game issue. When I get part 2 released I will have a deffinite answer for you. So is this game worth the money? Yes it is. Would I reccomend you get it? Yes if you enjoy games like Skyrim, 7 days to die or have played this game in the past.SMALL UPDATE:So this is not a deal breaker by any means. However I have discovered some odd performance issues that should not exist in a game this old on a pc as beefy as mine. Often times when in fog and with numerous enemies around the game slows down... Not really a noticable frame drop (picture is still smooth). It is more like everything is in some form of slow motion. Very odd and more likely than not something that the developers need to fix. This is the only real problem I have had!			"

												ONE OF THE VERY BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME FINALLY GETS A GOOD (NOT GREAT) PC PORTIf you were already a serious gamer back in the mid-'00s, you probably consider RE4 as one of the most important games of all time. Just like Gears of War, RE4 helped redefine the action-adventure shooter genre; it was a wild 3rd-1st person shooter hybrid with SWEET sniper weapons and, while it wasn't a traditional '90s survival horror game, it featured many elements of previous RE games, and it was a scary, dark game (not as dark as RE2-3 though). Sadly, the original 2007 PC port suffered from average graphics/textures and a total lack of mouse support (making aiming a living hell, yet the game was playable once you LEARNED to aim with the A-W-S-D keys-EPIC!, lol). That means the GameCube / Wii versions were the ultimate ports of RE4...until now...NOW we have this RE4 HD revival, and FINALLY serious PC gamers have the opportunity to play this game with mouse support and good-to-great textures/graphics. BUT BEWARE!, this HD 2014 pc port suffers from two major (or minor, depending on how good your pc is) FLAWS:a) the game is playable, but needs a fix; I can play 2012-2013 games on high-to-ultra settings with no problems, but I HAVE to run RE4 HD without motion blur, anti-aliasing, and I'm forced to use 30 fps (not the 60 fps option), at least I can run it with the HD graphics, LOL!; but gamers with 2010-2011 computers will STRUGGLE to run this game even on low settings and without (!) the HD graphics---EDIT: GAME ALREADY FIXED AND WORKING LIKE A CHARM---b) the gameplay is EXACTLY the same as RE 5, that means you can't walk/run while aiming, and you can't really move with the mouse (too slow-awkward), so you'll have to stick with the A,W,S,D keys for movement. That kinda makes RE4 HD a bit old-school; those who were hoping for a Mass Effect 3/Resident Evil 6-like gameplay will be disappointed....final verdict: 8,5/10 (the original GameCube-Wii game remains a solid-historical 10/10)			"

												One of my favourite games of all time. Redefined survival horror into something I actually wanted to play. Always hated the static camera of the older games. Super atmospheric, interesting characters, creepy enemies, epic bosses and awesome weapons that feel so great to wield. I've had it on the Gamecube, Wii and now PC. Graphically speaking this is the best of the bunch. Otherwise playing on the Wii with the wiimote was the superior experience. It just fit so well. Mouse and keyboard does a decent job though. I've found it better than using a controller at least. All the issues they had at launch seem to be gone now. Game looks great and runs at a solid 60fps. Highly recommended!			"

The only thing that brings it down is the Quick Time Events which have no place in a game like this, it doesn't help that they change constantly as well which can lead to multiple deaths, I probably died more to them then actual zombie / boss fights.Upon completion you unlock:A new difficulty 'Professional' New weapons for the playthrough.Under the extra tab missions unlock where you can play as 'Ada Wong' and see her side of the story. Mercenary Mode.I haven't dabbled too much into the extra content yet, but there is plenty of content here for your money.I completed it using a 360 controller and had no issues with the controls.

												One of the greatest games ever made. I first bought it to my gamecube back in 2005. Then my PS2, then my Nintento Wii and now to the PC with HD textures and 60 FPS. The atmosphere and the game mechanics makes it one of my best game experiences of all time. I'm really happy with the PC version. I have non of the problems reported by people, such as missing textures and or slow-mo. It runs perfect and it looks really good. You need a controller to play this, and the control scheme will take some time to learn but once you do, its flawless. You won't be dissapointed, though, this games has it all.Replayed on 4 different systems. A masterpiece!			"

												One of the greatest games ever made. I first bought it to my gamecube back in 2005. Then my PS2, then my Nintento Wii and now to the PC with HD textures and 60 FPS. The atmosphere and the game mechanics makes it one of my best game experiences of all time. I'm really happy with the PC version. I have non of the problems reported by people, such as missing textures and or slow-mo. It runs perfect and it looks really good. You need a controller to play this, and the control scheme will take some time to learn but once you do, its flawless. You won't be dissapointed, though, this games has it all.Replayed on 4 different systems. A masterpiece!			"

												OH PISSBALLS THIS IS AMAZING. Just sit there and awe in the amount of cpu you need to play this game. A GOD DAMN LOT!!! But once you have the right computer to play this on OH JEESUS CHRISTICLES THIS IS AMAZING. The story is while quite cliche has got some really good twists and turns. The gameplay is amazing with heart pounding sequences all around. The characters all are really memorable and the bosses OH THE BOSSES are either really fun and a good chalenge (eg Salazar and Saddler) but some are just frustratingly annoying (eg the double el gigante fight and vertigo). the games music is well... AMAZISAURUS REX. After you beat the great story mode you unlock fantastic other gamemodes that even show other sides of the story making for a completionists delight. this game is not only amazing with the epic and action packed sections but also sometimes scary as all hell making you jump out of your chair and scream louder than an airhorn. Anyway I have been a big fan or the resident evil series for a long time and now after replaying this it is definitely the best once.10/10 (seriously buy it, BUY IT WITH MONEY)			"

												Don't expect a complete re-invention of the game you played before.   This is, for all intents and purposes,  the *exact same* RE4 you're used to.   But that's not a bad thing.  In fact,  it feels alot like this is simply the port that PC gamers should have got several years ago in place of that P.O.S Konami pushed out that you needed a bunch of mods just to be able to play.  There are some basic control and graphical settings here which were absent before ( Mouse acceleration / sensitivity , keyboard re-mapping,  anti-aliasing,  etc.)  but generally speaking, it's still pretty light on options.  Even with the updated control options the feeling of playing RE4 with a mouse and keyboard is quite clunky.   And you know what?  The more I play this game, the more I feel like that's just part of the appeal.  Your enemies are slow and clunky and so are your controls.  Therein lies a huge part of why the game is so tense.   I'm glad that RE4 finally got the treatment it deserves on PC, but for some people it will be too little, too late.  Especially if you already bought the previous RE4 port.  But if you're a huge RE nerd, this is definitely worth trying out. 8/10.			"

												The game is simply amazing. A great port from console. The only problem that I have had so far has been trying to run the game and 60fps, the game nearly becomes unplayable with how slow and laggy it becomes. I fixed this by switching to 30fps. I do not think the game is optimized to run at 60fps at this time. My computer can easily handle newer games at max settings with no problems this game becomes so choppy at the first village swarm level that its nearly unplayable.I still recommand this game and I have hopes that Capcom would re-release the other Resident Evil games for PC as well! I would gladly buy them/ preorder them as soon as they got announced.			"

												Resident Evil 4 is my favorite game in the series!With over 30 playthroughs completed on PS2, 360, PS3, and now on PC, it is safe to assume that I know quite a lot about this game.Although not a perfect game, RE4 is the game that changed the old Resident Evil’s clunky controls for good. Also the voice acting is actually not as cheesy as the older games. The brand new 3rd person shooting mechanics made the game much more enjoyable as well.It is also the first game in the main series not to feature regular zombie enemies that walk slowly towards you. The newer enemies are infected Ganados that can offer quite a challenge during your first playthough.The only major flaw in this game is the horrible AI (a.k.a Ashley).9/10.			"

												Resident Evil 4 on Steam is still the same fantastic game it was on the Nintendo Gamecube almost a decade ago, albeit with a couple of technical quirks. This mostly has to deal with the new option to adjust the game's framerate from the previous 30 to a silky 60 frames per second. While this works fine about 90-95% of the time, due to the game originally being coded to run at 30fps, cutscene dialogue will de-sync, some particle effects will disappear early, and most damning, timing for the game's many QTEs (notably the ""mash"" actions) are adjusted significantly. Again, the rest of the game is fine, but if you're looking to sit back and watch the cutscenes, or you're stuck on a QTE sequence, you might be better off leaving that setting alone.			"

												I was expecting Resident Evil 4, but instead I got Rrrreeeeeesssiiiiddddent Eeeeeevvvviiiillll Foooooouuuurrrrr.My system is way more than enough to run this game, after all, I can run Battlefield 4 on max settings, yet I get slow motion gameplay. I'm not the only one with this problem, but I'm still in a minority.After I managed to get it running at a playable framerate (about 28-30 FPS) the resolution was 1280x720 and I had to turn off AA and advanced shadows, along with the ability to have 60 FPS. Fortunately the HD textures still work so it looks a little better than the version released on the PS3 and 360.Although I have no problem playing games on a low resolution due to the fact that I just now got a 1080p capable monitor (and an old one that is blurry at that) I can fully enjoy this game because it is REALLY good. Unfortunately, however, I cannot recommend it because I know other people will not be as forgiving as I am.A company like Capcom, with all of the money they have don't have a single excuse for releasing a botched port like this. This is something you have to expect from Japanese developers, however, because PC gaming isn't very popular in Japan.Buy at your own risk.			"

												I'm a follower of the saga when it started, with RE1, RE2 and RE3 on PSX and never got to play RE4 until 2016.The game mechanics are just like the good old days, but with dynamic scenarios instead of pre-rendered ones.It's difficul to get used to the controls compared to current generation games but perhap's that's part of the reason why this game keeps the essence of the classic titles.Cheesy conversations, probably because of a direct translation from Japanese.As a Spanish myself, I must say it's annoying that they used south american voice actors for the enemies' voices: The expressions and accents are way different from the spanish-from-spain ones.One thing that seriously bugged me is how there are few models for the zombies and it seems like you are killing the same zombie over and over again.Still, recommended for old times sake....

												English:Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition is quite a self-describing title: it is probably the best Resident Evil 4 version ever released, adapted at its best for modern gaming PCs. At the same time, it fails in providing something new for those who played the original, and for newcomers to the Resident Evil saga it will probably be something unappealing due to the deprecated gameplay mechanics.Italian:Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition tiene fede alla parola di essere, probabilmente, la migliore edizione di Resident Evil 4 mai creata, donandogli tutti i comfort di un gioco odierno ma senza snaturarne l’impatto originale. Al contempo, questo suo pregio è anche il suo peggior difetto: ora come ora, non c’è davvero alcun motivo per voler spendere 20 euro sull’ennesimo rifacimento di un gioco che gli appassionati avranno sicuramente già giocato e che i neofiti non sarebbero in grado di apprezzare. Da prendere solo ed esclusivamente se fate parte di questa seconda categoria ma siete in grado di andare oltre alle apparenze e adeguarvi al sistema di controllo.

												First things first, people need to start this game with the mentality that this is a 2004 Gamecube game that inspired many of the tropes seen in Third Person Shooters made today. Given that, it's also an incredibly unique game in its own right. This game was designed around controversial ""tank"" controls, and many people who are well adjusted to today's run of the mill TPS may be surprised to find that this game does not allow you to aim, shoot, or reload while on the move. Fear not, for the game has been from start to finish balanced and designed around this fact -- many encounters are designed such that you need to learn when to be shooting, and when to be moving to avoid enemy attacks; in this game they are two distinct actions that you need to constantly evaluate throughout a fight.The game mechanics are top notch, from satisfying melee's (Can you imagine suplexing someone so hard it blows their head off? It's amazing.), to an inventory system that will bring out the OCD in all of us. While it is true that one of the greatest games of the 6th generation is missing some of the current lineup's bells and whistles, if you go in with the right mindset, you'll find that Resident Evil 4 is impeccably paced, balanced, and thought out.The story is right about what you'd expect out of a Resident Evil game; it's a cheesy B movie, filled with memorable one liners (I see the president has equipped his daughter with... ballistics) and villains you'll remember far after you've disposed of them. If you like cheesy, this is the game for you. If you like games full of pretense of greater meaning, you'll need to look elsewhere.And finally, the game as a PC port. As a long time fan of Resident Evil 4, and a purist, the PC port is everything I could hope it was -- controls are intact, the sweet deadzones left untouched from the Gamecube version, and minus a specular effect here and there, uses the (at the time jaw dropping) assets from the Gamecube version. Textures might stick out to people accustomed to newer games, and yes, you're right, there are no fancy lighting effects, but the game has a clean aesthetic that doesn't blind you from the love put into the game's visual design. There is an HD texture pack available in the menu, however I've found that many textures fail to be consistent, from overly clean wood in some places to the old SD textures in others. Many find them an improvement, while I personally stick with the SD textures, because they are more consistent.The 60 FPS feature is... rushed. If your computer can handle it with no problem, 60fps is a beautiful sight to behold in this game. However some animations are still keyed to 30fps (A result of the game's Gamecube heritage) and can be jarring at times. Also, if your computer cannot run this game at 60fps for any reason, you will experience slowdown due to the way it is coded -- be aware you may need to set the game to run at the original 30fps to allay this.All in all, I would recommend this to ANY fan of Resident Evil 4, as this is so far the most complete version to render above the original 480p, and the few hiccups present in the porting are mostly limited to the new additions, and a patch is sure to clear most of those up. For people just getting into it, be ready: This IS NOT A NEW GAME. Keep in mind that it's a Gamecube game that, at the time, revolutionized the TPS genre, and that it will have its resultant quirks, and you're sure to have a good time with this masterpiece.			"

												If you are a true RESIDENT EVIL fan and worship the old classic games of the franchise. I tell you that RESIDENT EVIL 4 was not completely screwed up to this point. This game marks the end of an era in which capcom was still able to make good RE games. And After this title, all the sequels were nothing but recycled garbage. And even that they have improved the gameplay and the graphics a little, no RE game sounds as authentic as this one. Resident Evil 4 has a strong personality that conveys the feeling of all previous games respecting its universe.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Resident Evil foi revolucionário quando surgiu em 1996 como uma franquia de survivor horror no Playstation e Sega Saturn. Com a direção do criador da série Shinji Mikami, os títulos seguintes conseguiram se consolidar no mercado construindo uma personalidade forte no gênero tanto em termos de enredo, como jogabilidade e gráficos excelentes para a época.Quando a fórmula tornou-se no entanto um pouco desgastada, Shinji Mikami lançou Resident Evil 4 que surgiu com a árdua tarefa de renovar o estilo e trazer novas experiências para o gênero. Posso dizer que até aqui o game ainda mantinha muito da personalidade que fez do mesmo um grande sucesso, apesar de embarcar de vez em uma experiência mais ACTION e menos Survivor Horror. A história possui a maioria dos clichês dos blockbusters hollywoodianos e apesar de não ser extraordinária, ainda assim, quando inserida no contexto do game consegue trazer momentos emocionantes e de grande tensão, causando ao final do jogo a sensação de ter assistido a um grande filme de terror clássico americano. Resident Evil 4 mantem grande familiariedade com os lançamentos anteriores, pois muitos dos elementos antigos foram mantidos. Ainda é possivel usar a máquina de escrever para salvar os checkpoints, o baú de guardar itens para administrar munição e outros achados está presente, há ainda os puzzles e a possibilidade de investigar acontecimentos por meio de notas, agendas, fitas cassetes, vídeos e livros espalhados pelo mapa.  Além de tudo, RE4 expande o universo da saga para o enorme mundo 3d com muita qualidade e cuidado. E a maior parte dele se passa em ambientes escuros como mansões, calabouços, cavernas e fazendas afastadas da civilização, aumentando o clima de terror, mantendo os elementos de suspense e fazendo as pazes com os títulos antigos. Apesar da enorme mudança de ambientação e história, o ""Set"" é típico desse universo e consegue alcançar momentos épicos e cativantes a medida que o jogador progride na história.Os controles nesse novo game respondem bem e combinam com o estilo de jogabilidade. Parece que tudo se encaixa perfeitamente ao universo de Resident Evil e mesmo a movimentação do personagem sendo um pouco dura e sem agilidade, contribui para aumentar o nível de pânico e tensão durante os combates. Demora um pouco para conseguir se habituar, mas logo tudo flui intensamente.O jogo foi um divisor de águas no gênero survivor-horror e ação, trazendo consigo mecânicas de game inovadoras, como o campo de visão acima do ombro em terceira pessoa e os famosos ""Quick-events"". Durante a experiência de jogo, há a sensação de que o game não tentou forçar uma nova continuação, história e acontecimentos no universo de Resident Evil a fim de extrair novas continuações sem pé nem cabeça. E é exatamente por isso que o game consegue ser mais autêntico e agrada até mesmo os fans mais hardcore de longa data. Resident Evil 4 tem excelentes gráficos, aúdio de qualidade, bom nível de desafio e muita diversão. Pecando apenas no fato de não haver zumbis e na jogabilidade que com o uso do gamepad torna o game meio duro, pouco fluído e ágil na hora de movimentar o personagem. Sendo assim, RESIDENT EVIL 4 é um excelente título para colecionadores da saga e não deve em nada para outros games de survivor horror já lançados até hoje, tendo gráficos que ainda encantam e uma experiência única entre vários games do gênero, sendo por isso a edição mais premiada de toda a saga.9.5Nota Geral			"

												Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 HD edition is great, it is one of the best singleplayer games out there.The controls are difficult with mouse and keyboard, but I quickly got used to it.If you can't stand the PC controls, connect a gamepad and use that instead, you will get the got ol' console controls.[ You can switch between PC controls and gamepad controls at any time, no changing in the options required. ]The story itself is decent, I personally like it.Resident Evil 4 is definatly the best Resident Evil out there, it is better than Resident evil 5 and 6, no doubt about it.

												Aside from the terrible play control this game has, it falls into the RE franchise quite well.The superficial aspect of the game is good (graphics, sounds, music, etc.).The game mechanics are simple, but what do you expect from a RE game?Right now, the game seems linear, a nice well made corridor to follow that you cannot leave. :/But what kills the game is the awful controls typical of a console game.

												If you are a true RESIDENT EVIL fan and worship the old classic games of the franchise. I tell you that RESIDENT EVIL 4 was not completely screwed up to this point. This game marks the end of an era in which capcom was still able to make good RE games. And After this title, all the sequels were nothing but recycled garbage. And even that they have improved the gameplay and the graphics a little, no RE game sounds as authentic as this one. Resident Evil 4 has a strong personality that conveys the feeling of all previous games respecting its universe.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Resident Evil foi revolucionário quando surgiu em 1996 como uma franquia de survivor horror no Playstation e Sega Saturn. Com a direção do criador da série Shinji Mikami, os títulos seguintes conseguiram se consolidar no mercado construindo uma personalidade forte no gênero tanto em termos de enredo, como jogabilidade e gráficos excelentes para a época.Quando a fórmula tornou-se no entanto um pouco desgastada, Shinji Mikami lançou Resident Evil 4 que surgiu com a árdua tarefa de renovar o estilo e trazer novas experiências para o gênero. Posso dizer que até aqui o game ainda mantinha muito da personalidade que fez do mesmo um grande sucesso, apesar de embarcar de vez em uma experiência mais ACTION e menos Survivor Horror. A história possui a maioria dos clichês dos blockbusters hollywoodianos e apesar de não ser extraordinária, ainda assim, quando inserida no contexto do game consegue trazer momentos emocionantes e de grande tensão, causando ao final do jogo a sensação de ter assistido a um grande filme de terror clássico americano. Resident Evil 4 mantem grande familiariedade com os lançamentos anteriores, pois muitos dos elementos antigos foram mantidos. Ainda é possivel usar a máquina de escrever para salvar os checkpoints, o baú de guardar itens para administrar munição e outros achados está presente, há ainda os puzzles e a possibilidade de investigar acontecimentos por meio de notas, agendas, fitas cassetes, vídeos e livros espalhados pelo mapa.  Além de tudo, RE4 expande o universo da saga para o enorme mundo 3d com muita qualidade e cuidado. E a maior parte dele se passa em ambientes escuros como mansões, calabouços, cavernas e fazendas afastadas da civilização, aumentando o clima de terror, mantendo os elementos de suspense e fazendo as pazes com os títulos antigos. Apesar da enorme mudança de ambientação e história, o ""Set"" é típico desse universo e consegue alcançar momentos épicos e cativantes a medida que o jogador progride na história.Os controles nesse novo game respondem bem e combinam com o estilo de jogabilidade.

												Let me start off by saying Resident Evil 4 is a great game. I've been playing Resident Evil since the 2nd game and I have to say they really rebooted the franchise in a amazing way with this title. From the controls to the gameplay everything seemed to come together.  With all that being said I have to caution you about this HD version of the game as I ran into some issues that soured my gaming experience a bit with this title. The most jarring complaint I have with this game was the sudden drop in frame rate during certain moments. It's hard for me to believe that a game this old despite the HD update could not maintain a constant 60fps when certain particle effects like rain or a large amount of characters were on screen at one time. It even effected one of the boss battles something that could have easily taken me out of the game if it ultimately deterred my ability to move forward. My second complaint was the controller support. While the game did detect all of my buttons there were some weird moments during quick time events where they would not register. There was one point during the game that I basically had to use the mouse and keyboard just to get to the next area and unfortunately once I switched,  my controller was no longer responsive and I had to use the alternative until I could find a save point..not the best time with that.   With these two issues paying for the game at the full price would have felt like a mistake. Lucky for me I grabbed this during a humble bundle sale. I'm giving this a recommendation because despite some of the bad experiences, this is a good game and you should play it. I just want to make people aware there may be some issues.			"

												Bought it on the gamecube, ps2, wii, xbox 360, ps3, and now pc.I have beaten it over 10 times and each time is just as good as the last.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good action third person shooter with a very small side of survival horror.  This game is great and hasan't aged much at all in the decade plus since its release.I will say though that there are some bugs in the game.  It did crash a few times, and sometimes when I would quit the game, it would not end properly and the screen would go completely black; not even bringing up task manager could bring back the screen.  I would then have to do a complete system reboot.  Not a huge, huge deal, but it is definitely something worth noting.Anyways, buy this game, and experience a masterpiece.			"

												Its a amazing game, RE4 make great changes in RESIDENT universe. The theme is perfect and las plagas brings a new kind of game, without zombies BUT with enemies strong enough. Leon is a protagonist strong and funny with some jokes along the game. The track sound is cool. The suitcase system is better than the old weapon boxes in resident evil.Sure, the game have some problems, The QTE(Quick time events) are very easy, if you press the four buttons at the same time, you just pass, the ultimate boss is the easier one, just keep distance and shoot him. I finish without take one hit from him.I played the separete ways with the beauty Ada, is a plus in history, you gain more hours in game. Congrats CAPCOM.			"

												This is not a good port unfortunately. The graphics are not really updated, although it does run at 1080p 60FPS.The worst part for me were the controls, espcially keyboard and mouse. The game is playable if you choose to get used to them. The game was not updated to move like a modern day shooter, ie use the mouse to steer the character. Instead A and D are used to move/rotate.Use an x-box controller or get used to the awkward keyboard/mouse set-up.I can't recommend this version unfortunately. Hopefully PC will get a newer patch when the PS4 version is released??			"

If you can get your hands on any other platform's release, play it there.  If you must play it on PC though, it's worth picking up on Steam.  Just beware that the mouse controls weren't very well implemented in-game as is.  Also, it is surprisingly system intensive for a game this old.			"

												One of the best games of all time! I had so much fun with this game back when it came out. I was so happy to see that there's a native pc port of this game with hd textures and new game engine for steam. This is one of the best survival horror games; if not, the best of all survival horror games, period. The controls with the keyboard and mouse is surprisingly good and so is the controllers controls as well. The graphics is still one of the most stylish looking games, the hd textures are pretty good looking. I had to stand around certain objects and just go ""wow, that texture..."". I personally can't wait for what modders will do with the graphics in the future. The sound quality sounds a lot better and clearer than the previous pc port or the consoles version (excluding the ps3/360 port). The cutscenes are real-time and looks great in 60 fps, I have decided to just watch all the cutscenes again, now that it's in HD, 60fps, and has subtitles as well. The gameplay is amazing to this game, I still think that the gameplay is better than most games I have played in the past few years. I totally recommend this game for any pc gamer both new and returning players to this game. This is the best way to bring back your good memories of this game. Any new players will very much enjoy this game as well.			"

(see below)CONS:* Still missing the same Nintendo hardware specific 'tricks' which provided a few subtle texture effects* No overhauls of the controls for keyboard and mouse players* Still the same control system, which may bother some people* Textures are almost all still the same source as the original* Some systems will experience slow down due to the way in which the engine is forced to time itself			"

												Resident Evil IMO is the best game in the franchise, although it may be the catalyst to the garbage we have today (RE5&6) it still delivers a great experience with an interesting setting with enemy’s while sometimes being pushovers can provide a decent challenge.Only 3 difficulties with one of them being unlocked after completion (Spoilers) which is Professional mode and I’m pretty sure I killed someone after the amount of times I died during my first playthrough on this difficulty. Great inventory system, with a good choice of weapons and upgrades. Highly recommend playing on Normal instead of easy as the game isn’t as enjoyable on the lower difficulty.Ashley is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥from time to time but is manageable once you get used to protecting her in tight spaces, some decent bosses and Regenerators which made me scream my minuscule balls off the first time I encountered them. Final Boss is a bit too easy for my liking and probably one of the worst in the series IMO but I digress.A decent amount of things to do after the games completed such as the 2 Ada Scenarios and the mercenaries’ mode which is really fun and challenging. Defiantly worth picking up, wait till it goes on sale as the current price is a bit too much however great game all together 9/10 because of Ashley. "

												Let me start off by saying Resident Evil 4 is a great game. I've been playing Resident Evil since the 2nd game and I have to say they really rebooted the franchise in a amazing way with this title. From the controls to the gameplay everything seemed to come together.  With all that being said I have to caution you about this HD version of the game as I ran into some issues that soured my gaming experience a bit with this title. The most jarring complaint I have with this game was the sudden drop in frame rate during certain moments. It's hard for me to believe that a game this old despite the HD update could not maintain a constant 60fps when certain particle effects like rain or a large amount of characters were on screen at one time. It even effected one of the boss battles something that could have easily taken me out of the game if it ultimately deterred my ability to move forward. My second complaint was the controller support. While the game did detect all of my buttons there were some weird moments during quick time events where they would not register. There was one point during the game that I basically had to use the mouse and keyboard just to get to the next area and unfortunately once I switched,  my controller was no longer responsive and I had to use the alternative until I could find a save point..not the best time with that.   With these two issues paying for the game at the full price would have felt like a mistake. Lucky for me I grabbed this during a humble bundle sale. I'm giving this a recommendation because despite some of the bad experiences, this is a good game and you should play it. I just want to make people aware there may be some issues.			"

												This is an old game so the review won't be too long.Gameplay-Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game still outclasses every ♥♥♥♥ing third person shooter to date. Pretty much every ♥♥♥♥ing TPS game these days got its ideas from this game. This game made shooting enemies in the face for 20 hours FUN. Blowing off a head never ♥♥♥♥ing got old. The game also changes it up every now and then to keep it exciting. They give you ♥♥♥♥ing mine carts, they give you ♥♥♥♥ing harpoons, they give you ♥♥♥♥ing creepy mazes, oh you want some jet skis too? This game has that as well. This game's got it all. This game kicks ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥ Why can't Capcom make games like this anymore? Some people complain that this game wasn't as scary as the originals and that the puzzles were way too easy. Who the ♥♥♥♥ wants to solve puzzles in a zombie game? The puzzles in the originals were boring as ♥♥♥♥ and pointless filler to make the games seem longer. The original RE's weren't even ♥♥♥♥ing scary. They just had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls to make up for the fact that it wasn't scary. Some people actually want them to put the overhead camera in the next RE game, ♥♥♥♥ no. The overhead camera was acceptable in the PS1 era but not now. The older RE's sucked balls and you know it. Metal Gear Solid had an overhead camera and it was 1000000000x better than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RE games. They weren't even ♥♥♥♥ing scary. The only thing scary about them was the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. How many people do you know would be that ♥♥♥♥ing slow when zombies are chasing them? RE4 is better in every conceivable way, and manages to be pretty creepy at times even though it doesn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angles. The inventory in this game also kicks♥♥♥♥♥because you can carry multiple weapons at once but have to choose what weapons and how much space you will leave for healing herbs, ammo, etc. It makes you really think about what you will carry and makes it a little more tactical. This game also gives a ton of content since you got the main game, which is around 20 hours long. A kick♥♥♥♥♥Professional mode ( New game +) an awesome round wave type mode called Mercenaries, an extra 5-6 hour campaign where you play as this hot chick named Ada who is one of the characters in the game, another hour long minigame where you play as her collecting stuff, and a ton of costume, bottle caps, and weapons to unlock. It also has a lot of secrets in game. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game and hate Capcom for abandoning all this cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ The bosses and weapons kick♥♥♥♥♥as well. The game also manages to be hard but not frustrating because when you die it's usually your fault.Sound-The sound in this game ♥♥♥♥ing rocks. The quality may be outdated but interestingly enough it still beats every game out there in terms of atmosphere and♥♥♥♥♥♥ The sound in this game makes you feel like you're ♥♥♥♥ing there. The thunder and rain, the chantings of the enemies, the creepy regenerator sounds, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. The sound in this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ I masturbated to the sound of ashley crying out for leon like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. The VA is not bad, the dialogue is cheesy but it's almost perfectly delivered and made me crack up quite a bit.Graphics-Ok this HD port sucks♥♥♥♥♥but since it's a 9 year old game I'll give it some slack. The game looks kind of muddy but it still looks a lot better than alot of games these days such as The Saboteur and there's never any frame rate slowdowns or any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that. The HD port looks pretty much the same as the Wii version except it brings back the laser sight which makes it alot better since you can't just shoot all over the place and it cleans up some of the textures a bit so as not to make your eyes disintegrate. It still looks kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at some parts but it's definitely bearable and the gameplay still kicks ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥regardless.StoryOk usually I would rip on a story like this but the reason I don't is because even though the story is really ♥♥♥♥ing cheesy the game actually acknowledges this and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's actually quite enjoyable and the dialogue is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Some of Leon's lines are awesome. Though the story is cheesy it does keep you involved and the cutscenes are short and get to the point. Eitherway, the gameplay kicks♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Bought it on the gamecube, ps2, wii, xbox 360, ps3, and now pc.I have beaten it over 10 times and each time is just as good as the last.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good action third person shooter with a very small side of survival horror.  This game is great and hasan't aged much at all in the decade plus since its release.I will say though that there are some bugs in the game.  It did crash a few times, and sometimes when I would quit the game, it would not end properly and the screen would go completely black; not even bringing up task manager could bring back the screen.  I would then have to do a complete system reboot.  Not a huge, huge deal, but it is definitely something worth noting.Anyways, buy this game, and experience a masterpiece.			"

												I've probably beaten Re4 at least a hundred times between every platform it's been ported to. I personally think it's extremely overrated, with people clinging to it like it was the best thing ever created. Pros:- Probably the last decent RE game!- LEON, WESKER, ADA, SHERRY.. i mean ASHLEY! The gang is all here!- You can kill stuff!- Puzzles and Mazes!- High replay-ability! (A lot of cool overpowered unlocks)- So much nostalgia!Cons:- No zombies?- Krauser? (Who is this guy who they try to act like has a back-story?)- Ashley's voice- Wesker is the bad guy again!- Not having enough cash, stranger- Seriously though.. the first RE without zombies.If you've never played it, it's worth the buy! If you HAVE played it, it's worth the buy! OMG JUST BUY THIS AND PLAY IT!			"

												Its a amazing game, RE4 make great changes in RESIDENT universe. The theme is perfect and las plagas brings a new kind of game, without zombies BUT with enemies strong enough. Leon is a protagonist strong and funny with some jokes along the game. The track sound is cool. The suitcase system is better than the old weapon boxes in resident evil.Sure, the game have some problems, The QTE(Quick time events) are very easy, if you press the four buttons at the same time, you just pass, the ultimate boss is the easier one, just keep distance and shoot him. I finish without take one hit from him.I played the separete ways with the beauty Ada, is a plus in history, you gain more hours in game. Congrats CAPCOM.			"

												What i can say about this RE game.....hmmm. Its not bad but also is not a survival horror like the old ones. But still have some of this little taste of ""survival horror"" (compared with 5 and 6, RE4 still have many factors that make this game a ""little"" survival). Other good point of view about this game is that now you can play it at 60 FPS (the old one was only playable at 30 FPS). So, is much better for your eyes (the human eyes can only see 60 frames per second. More FPS is nonsense)Also, it have HD resolution, some post-procesing effects (light) and new textures.I really recomend this game. For 2 reasons: Is one of the newest RE games that keep that survival horror taste. And second, becouse i am a big fan of this saga (attention, not confuse with a fan boy :))			"

												This HD remake looks good and runs well. It is hard just like all the other RE games but has more in common with why 1-3 were mainly hard: the tank controls. 5 controls much better than this game and 6 controls better than them all combined. They didn't put zombies in 4 or 5 which is imo the worst thing about them, then they finally brought zombies back in 6. The game plays well and is a classic fun RE game. I played it on the PS2 a ton and loved it back in the day. All ports until this HD one for the pc have been horrible so it is finally nice to play the game again after so long. Not my fav RE game but still a great one.8/10			"

												Resident Evil IMO is the best game in the franchise, although it may be the catalyst to the garbage we have today (RE5&6) it still delivers a great experience with an interesting setting with enemy’s while sometimes being pushovers can provide a decent challenge.Only 3 difficulties with one of them being unlocked after completion (Spoilers) which is Professional mode and I’m pretty sure I killed someone after the amount of times I died during my first playthrough on this difficulty. Great inventory system, with a good choice of weapons and upgrades. Highly recommend playing on Normal instead of easy as the game isn’t as enjoyable on the lower difficulty.Ashley is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥from time to time but is manageable once you get used to protecting her in tight spaces, some decent bosses and Regenerators which made me scream my minuscule balls off the first time I encountered them. Final Boss is a bit too easy for my liking and probably one of the worst in the series IMO but I digress.A decent amount of things to do after the games completed such as the 2 Ada Scenarios and the mercenaries’ mode which is really fun and challenging. Defiantly worth picking up, wait till it goes on sale as the current price is a bit too much however great game all together 9/10 because of Ashley. "

												A solid and quality rerelease of a classic action adventure game for current systems. If you like to play classic games, warts and all, and with all the old gameplay mechanics and controls intact, then this game is for you. Take a trip down memory lane by playing one of the greatest games ever made.PROS:* Just like the original Gamecube/Wii editions but enhanced (subtly)* Not the absolutely terrible SourceNEXT port of the Ps2 version* A port of the Xbox 360 'HD' version of the game* Xbox 360 gamepad integration and three control profiles* Three post processing effect profiles to try out* Original textures improved for clarity and compression but ... (see below)CONS:* Still missing the same Nintendo hardware specific 'tricks' which provided a few subtle texture effects* No overhauls of the controls for keyboard and mouse players* Still the same control system, which may bother some people* Textures are almost all still the same source as the original* Some systems will experience slow down due to the way in which the engine is forced to time itself			"

												One of the best and most loved Resident Evil games of all times. I was really excited about this port and the game is as fantastic as it was back then. But we all played RE4 so I don't want to talk about the game itself, but about the technicial aspect of it.As promised you're getting a RE4 HD experience like never before. 60fps really gives the game a new feel but unfortunately there are some issues with that as well. The game's engine wasn't designed to run at 60fps so there are some bugs. But overall doens't hurt the experience.The so called ""HD textures"" are a complete joke and aren't much of an upgrade from the original. Luckily there's a fan made high res texture pack on its way that looks beyond promising and it might be worth buying just for that. On top of that this game is poorly optimized, so if you have a low end computer, be warned, it's much more demanding than the original PC port and you might not be able to run this. All this aside, it's still a great game and I do recommend it.			"

												I picked this game up as part of a humble bundle for about 70 pence, and it is now my current favourite game I have played in 2016. This is the absolute perfect horror and third person shooter single player game!- Really well designed tank controls (be super aware of your surroundings at all times)- Absolutely no jumpscares- A variety of upgradable weapons- Alternate costumes for characters- A 5-6 hour side campaign unlocked after beating the main game- Lots of replayability- Unique enemy types that I'VE never seen in another game- Cheesy Dialogue- Mercernaries Minigame- The Chicago TypewriterWould highly reccomend.

												Great goodness this port is BAAADThe game is near a decade old but it struggles to play in certain areas so much I had to dumb down my resolution and turn on the 30 fps limit.My Computer is old, but it's not so much a clunker that it should have any reason to run Resi4 horribly.Capcom dropped the ball again!(you had TWO shots at this port!)They're in my book near Ubisoft in PC ports!As for the game itself:I have never played RE 4 up until now.I just heard so much hype and praise around it, especially when RE 5 and 6 came out, or any ""personal top games ever"" I hear from people.And I would like to say.They're not wrong.I like this game but I don't ""love"" it.It is a fantastic game yes, and I am enjoying it.Maybe its my personal inability to get hooked or maybe I actually don't like it(probably the former) but this game is in no way bad.Stuff I like:+Tense... especially when I never played this before and everything is new to me.+Managable.  On ""Normal"" I've been having to ration ammo but I rarely ever run out to the point where I have to knife everything.+Tank Controls...  yeah... the tank controls made it harder to perform fast,precise actions therefore added to the tense ""I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!"" moments+Inventory Tetris isn't that bad... I kept my inv. clean and never really wound up with the infamous clutter this game is known forStuff I didn't like:-Horribad PC Port-Ashley's voice-Ambiguous healing amounts: When I need to heal I sometimes catch myself struggling whether or not the weaker mixed herbs or a single green is enough-Knife distance: Nyeh! NyeH! get closer DAMNIT!!!-Bad Keyboard Mouse... apparently... never really used them cause people told me not to and I defaulted to controller.So the stuff I didn't like are basically minor gripes.  This game is GREAT! BUUUUTTTTT it'lll probably be for the best to get it on console to avoid half the problems of running it.			"

												This is the game that killed, yet strangely saved the resident evil franchise. If this game hadn't been as successful as it was it's possible the franchise wouldn't still be here today. What I mean by ""killed the franchise"" is that it made a drastic change from the first three games by putting itself in a more action oriented enviorment, leading the franchise to pop out many terrible games with very few good ones recently. Speaking of action it makes the game much scarier than its predecessors in my opinion. You have a scarce supply ammunition, enemies which act as bullet sponges, and a combat knife. The damage is distributed similairly so to how it is done in the Dark Souls series, enemies deal massive damage with slow attacks. When all of these elements are used in tandom you are forced to rely on your own wit to outsmart, outmanevour, and defeat your enemies. The gameplay is really fun while being pretty scary, its definitely one of the high points of the game. When it comes to the story what are you expecting? It's a resident evil game, while I wouldnt say the plot is predictable you should have an idea of what to expect, if that makes any sense. The game also has a series of unlockables for when you beat the game in different scenarios adding a lot of replay value. Most notable of the unlockables is the mini-game ""Mercenaries"" where you fight hordes of enemies with predetermined weapons in 1 of 4 stages. It can definitely keep you occupied after the main campaign. In the end this game is easy to reccomend at only $20, I can say with confidence that the game is an easy 9.7/10.			"

												It's been a minute since I've played this on the Gamecube. So how is it?.............................................+ gameplay is pretty tight. Sometimes I wish I could move the camera faster or turn faster, but aside from that it feels great to this day.+ This game works its tones well. On one side the cheesy dialogue and whacky characters are super fun like Salazar skimpering out of the spike room and on the other we have tense, eerie moments like being hunted by Verdugo.+ music is varied and lets me drink in each environment.+ good amount of challenge in this. You can't move and shoot, so taking careful aim and thinking about how to out pace the enemy is key.+ checkpoints are pretty generous. Save opportunites come often, but they still place checkpoints at the beginning of most rooms in case you goof..............................................~ for the most part the port is good. HD graphics are nice and this package gives you a lot of extra content; however, I did encounter a few odd hiccups. Notably the infamous minecart QTE  section that I had trouble passing because the graphics were set to fixed 60 fps. A more unfortunate one was a hard crash after a lengthy section of trenches and a helicopter..............................................- I'm always going to dock this for changing the direction of the game to action horror from survival horror. Don't get me wrong I love this game, but this could EASILY have not been a Resident Evil game and just swapped out Leon and Ada.- There are lots of things this game brought to the industry, but I can't remember QTEs being as popular after the release of RE4. QTEs can be fine, but instakill QTEs are just frustrating. Make QTEs like stairs: step correctly and keep going. Step incorrectly and slip a bit, not break your head open at the bottom of the stairwell..............................................Don't choose a side. Lots of people like to be on one side of the fence when it comes to RE games, but dare to stand in both. I personally love the survival horror ones, but these are still fun and worth your time.			"

												I won't waste time talking about why you should play RE4, people have been telling you to for years. Instead, I'll complain about the port. Even on a decent rig, it runs pretty poorly. Locked 60fps/30fps only options cause cutscenes to lag/audio to desynch. You can manually override these, but it screws the game up even further and makes some event triggers unresponsive (the one that drove me crazy was doors not opening and that truck in the one part not exploding). Resident Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is a poor treatment of a fantastic game. It amazed me to learn that this is supposed to be the UPDATED port and that the older port was even worse. So do play Resident Evil 4, but get it on another system. The PC port isn't worth the frustration.			"

												As much as I love this game, this port is a complete joke.You will be lucky if your game does not crash every 15 minutes and get audio stuttering every time an enemy appears.The ""HD"" textures are so good that a bunch of amateur did a better job than Capcom (give a look to the forum if you ever buy the game by mistake).Oh, and I almost forget about the snipers animation that are still at 30fps (!!!).I guess I should be glad that I did not buy the game and got it through Humble Bundle.

												Today's Review: Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 HDNot a real review but more like a ""let's think for a moment"" review of this amazing game.Disclaimer: There are many reviews telling you the game is good or fun or not, so i'm gonna go with the assuption that you've read those reviews and know why you should or should't buy this game.Let's cut to the chase, The Plot: It's been 6 years since the Raccoon City incident and Umbrella has fallen, from that other companies have risen to provide the market and keep developing and selling the virus and in some cases modifing the virus to keep making more RE games. You step on the boots once again of Leon S. Kennedy, protagonist of Resident Evil 2, on Spain sent by the President of the United States to save his daughter that have been kidnapped, now here's the first thing i don't get, He's the President of the United States, the most powerful nation on earth and thenfore the most important person on earth, and when his daughter is kidnapped he sends a single man? for god's sake send several FBI teams! i mean they send Marines highly trained for hostage situations on Irak  and they are just regular ppl and you're sending a man alone to save the most important person in your life? I mean it's basically the same as let her die, and on top of that Leon during the game recieves little or no support to acomplish this great goal of saving her, only Hunnigan during the first 2/4 of the game and 1 chopper nearly the end, this was the first problem with the plot, the second problem comes with the actual plan of Saddler. Saddler had as a plan to kidnap the president's daughter (which i recon must be pretty difficult considering who she is and pretty easy considering how much the president has put in to save her) Infect her with ""Las Plagas"" a host/master parasite that renders the mind useless and takes control of the body of the host, being Saddler the master, so essentially his plan to control the world or get money (as Leon is told) it's to send her back to his father's arms and infect the president with this ""Las Plagas"", now here's what i think, when Saddler knew leon was in to save her, would't be the best option to let him save her and then, when she returns to his father, make more believable than sending her back by ""good will"" instead of trying to kill Leon and maybe Ashley during the course of the game? I mean are all the Ganados really stupid ? If you let Leon rescue her without telling Leon your plan, he might think everything's ok, she will go back to her's father, infect him with the parasite and then the president himself will be a minion of Saddler, instead he hires Mercenaries such Krauser or even the bosses like Salazar to kill Leon and ""return her"" to his father, would that be really suspcious? am i overlooking this? i mean if you played the game this are really good questions.Obviously for this to actually be a game with good guy and bad guy the plot it's overlocked, it's a really good game so enjoy it!

												Super disapointed in this game, i think this only affects the one who have played the originals, RE1-2& 3 on console back in the days.. terrible controller port to, it just feels bugged and wrong. and to start of with leon, and not Barry or Rebecca, jumps this offgrid straight away.. same with no chooise between alpha or bravo S.T.A.R.S team.. if you turn the clock back to 1996 and you played the first ones you understand my point.. if not i guess you will like it as it is, since you dont know the background story of the game at all.. for me who likes the games to keep the original line this is not good at all.. and jill & chris scenarios all gone to so..  i give this 1 of 10 same with res6 since it has nothing to do with the originals, and i dont like changes! Have fun playing this..			"

												The PC controls are sluggish compared to the original on PS2. I've heard they're better with a windows controller but I don't own one. Even if I did, and I didn't own a PS3, I'd still want to watch some youtube or a friend play with a controller to confirm it was a better player experience before purchasing. As-is, I can't recommend anyone play this port. If Capcom decides to patch this to make the controls as sensitive as they were originally, I'll be glad to change my review.Update: I've now played with a windows Xbox controller, and the controls are still as sluggish as with the mouse scrolling. I specifically recall the PS2 version playing much better and aim scrolling much more quickly. I am definitely not satisfied with this product.			"

												RE4 HD edition is a really weak port. It is better than the previous PC release, but it still sucks a fat one in many aspects. The performance is completely horrible for a game that is nearly a decade old. It has this bizarre framerate limiter that can either be set to 30 or 60. It isn't regular vsync. If the framerate drops below the specified range, the game goes into slow motion and the audio drops out of sync. This would be almost forgivable if there was a user definable frame limiter (supposing there was some kind of wonky engine limitations that make such a handicap necessary), but simply chosing between 30 and 60 is a slap in the face. The game is virtually unplayable when it is locked at 30fps, and to add insult to self inflicted, rage induced injury, the motion blur option doesn't smooth things over at all. In fact, it makes it looks literally nausia-inducingly bad. I would not recommend this to anyone with a vaguely mid range computer.			"

												Let me start this shïte off by saying that outta my many hours of playing this game, I've only had it crash or ♥♥♥♥♥ up ONCE. And that was (evidently) not a reproducible error or anything.Seriously, the sheer stability of this game alone makes it a digital architectural masterpiece, and that's just mentioning that one freakin' subject!Moving on, the gameplay is either difficult or easy to explain. Ever played Dead Space? 1 or 2. You have? Great. You'll feel right at home. Just aim for the head instead-a the arms, otherwise it's basically the same kinda gameplay.Sound? Well, shït... there's nothing to report there. It works, no glitches or issues, but it's not something you really nerd-fap to or whatever.Story? Ehh... it's cheesier than your mum's cooch, but it works. Kinda tongue-in-cheek (or at least I hope so... it's Capcom, after all. The lousy hacks...)Length? Lemme put it this way... ever played NG+ in Dead Space? SAME THING. AGAIN. I swear, DS must-a ripped RE4 off BIG TIME for ""inspiration"". Simply put, you can play the game over and over with the same savefile a hundred billion times if you gots the time for it. (I sure as hell don't.)So, bottom line... is it fun? Yes. Yes it is. But is it worth the price? Ehhh... maybe. If you're a massive fan of RE4 (and really, let's face it, that's the only GOOD one in the entire freakin' series!), then yeah. It's worth it. Hell, a freakin' GameCube copy of it'll cost you at least twice that of Steam's askin' price! And then there're the sales...Anyhoo. Score-stuff. It's a solid 9/10The lack of subtitles unless you play in japanese is just ♥♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but fortunately the voice-acting is good 'nuff to not warrant subtitles as a necessity. It's got full controller support, so us PROPER RE4-players will feel right at home, too. So yeah. Definitely good, but not perfect. 9/10			"

												Finally a decent port to what I consider the best title on the series.If you haven't played RE4, I really wouldn't consider it a horror game but it's by far one of the most entertaining action games I've ever played. Combat is really solid, exploration and loot gathering encouraged, managing the inventory and upgrading weapons addictive as hell, plus it sports a really long campaign with some fantastic pacing making this a classic.Plus, the completely ridiculous story and hilarious characters do nothing but improve the experience.As far as the PC version goes, it looks and works great. I believe that the original RE4's graphics still hold up due to some great art and design, but the constant 60 FPS (which make a VERY noticeable difference), improved textures and the fact that cutscenes aren't pre-rendered anymore mean that this time it's actually enjoyable.If I were to complain about something, it would be that you can't customize the controls, just pick from a few presets, and having to shoot with X (on the Xbox pad) feels super weird.

												When I was younger I remember shivering with anticipation at the mystery and atmosphere of Resident Evil 4. While flawed it was an engaging piece of entertainment, and I remember its nuances and creative design most favourably. This HD super-dooper remake, however, disappoints. My computer is not very powerful, but even with the overhead of an emulator can run the PS2 version well. This, however, runs like a rusty chainsaw even when lowered -below- PS2 version graphics specs. It lags horrifically seemingly at random, the performance is uneven, and the mouse support is poor. I am reminded of the catastrophe that was the original RE4 PC version. This would seem to be a reskinned version of that failure. For $30 I expected a proper remake, not more reskinned garbage like we've been seeing.I would appreciate, but do not expect, a refund and in future a new version of the program made available that is actually designed for PC and supports a mouse somewhat better.

												I love Resident Evil 4. It's one of my top 3 favorite games of all time. I bought it on GameCube, I bought it on PS2, I even bought it on Wii. So it pains me to say that I can't recommend the Ultimate HD Edition. Between the clunky controls, the ever-present slowdowns regardless of whether you're running on 30 FPS or 60 FPS and regardless of how good your computer may be, and the gamebreaking crashes on Windows 10 that make it literally impossible to continue through the game, it's just not worth your $20.If you're really looking to play RE4 again, or even for the first time, get it on the PlayStation Store. Get it on the Xbox Live store. Hell, find your old GameCube or PS2 or Wii and dust that off. But don't waste your time or your money on this poor excuse of a port.			"

												I'm writing this as someone who's played waaaay more RE5 than RE4. Sorry for not kissing the game's♥♥♥♥♥like every nostalgic fanboy on the internet. I'll update the review as more pros and cons come to me.Pros+The music is leagues better than RE5's. Surround sound survival horror gaming bliss.+The game runs at 60 FPS. Running on Windows 8 with no problems optimization-wise.+While the graphics are slowly starting to show their age, the level aesthetics are timelessly creepy.+Enemies are significantly scarier with far less effort, making RE5's seem goofy and tryhardish (even moreso than usual).+Combining treasure is fun and rewarding.+The merchant is one of the most interesting and likable characters in the Resident Evil lore, and we know nothing about him. Let's keep it that way, Capcom.Cons-No strafing. -So much as touching the right stick causes the camera to swing to either side of Leon.-No aiming sensitivity setting. I hope you like aiming at a snail's pace.-The only stun point worth shooting is the head. There's no melee prompt for any other stun point.-Combining ammo with a firearm in-menu does nothing.-Leon aims his gun like Micheal J. Fox. USA's secret service training sucks a big one.-The merchant is a stingy chainsmoking jerk. I know you have ammo, you know I'm good for it! Take my money!The controls feel ancient, and it started Resident Evil on its so-called ""downward slope to action,"" but it's still a good game, and a decent port (speaking from a win8 perspective). Wait for a sale.			"

												Great game, but not very realistic! ;-)Coming at this game on a PC will be a shock. The controls are bad, and they're bad on purpose. This game's difficulty was balanced for consoles, and it remains bad on PC. Don't expect to be landing headshots and powering through levels like you're the marine from Doom.Pretend that it's keyboard only. You don't steer with the mouse. It's hard to get used to at first - like if you started up a shooter and the Y-axis is inverted. Deep down, your brain still understands the mechanics, but it takes some time before it fully integrates into your playstyle.If you can get past that, you're in for a treat.			"

The controls are too far apart and you are forced to move with the arrow keys on the key board instead of the mouse. If I compare resident evil retribution to this game it's like playing packman. Steam is no help at all. This game is not what I thought it was, therefor I tried to exchange it through steam. I never heard from them. Don't wast your money or time with resident evil 4 and forget Steam customer service because it doesn't exist.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this port, but if you're PC is only average, you'll probably experience frequent crashes every ten minutes like I have.  I tried updating my video card driver, verifying the games cache, downloading the 4GB patch, running the executable in administrator mode, different compatibility modes, I even had to contact Capcom support, and nothing worked.It's really such a shame, because honestly, Resident Evil 4 is my favorite game...

												This is a game that I don't feel bad about being upset when people say they haven't played it, as it has been ported to almost every console that has come out since the game's release in 2005.Resident Evil 4 is, and may always remain, one of my favorite games of all time. I'm not going to go in-depth with why because I feel I'd just be preaching to the choir, but it is a game that is worth playing even 9 years after its release. Do yourself a favor and check out the game that defined the era it first existed in and has continued to shine through all of its various ports (except the original PC port, we like to pretend that one didn't exist.)

												Nice graphical update of a ten year old Gamecube game.  The gameplay is classic Resident Evil: tank controls, bullet sponge monsters, huge boss monster duels, and the constant scramble to find ammo.   The story is also classic RE, meaning it barely has one.  That said, it is still a really fun game to play.			"

												Well, after playing through the game several times, unlocking all the achievments, and doing more research into this, I've come to the conclusion that I cannot recommend Resident Evil 4 to everyone in its current state. Elaborating on that, I CAN recommend it to you if you have a very high-end PC. I mean higher than the Recommended specs listed on the store page, because this game is poorly optimized and will cause lag even if you have a decent computer that can run other high demand games at fair settings and a steady frame rate. Even setting the textures to SD and locking at 30FPS can still cause slowdown in some rooms.Slow down problems aside, the game is also moderatly buggy. Nothing game-breaking I've noticed so far, but after an event that takes the camera away from Leons back (such as being grabbed by an enemy), the camera will glitch out and be stuck in the position it took when you were grabbed until you move your mouse/analog stick around. That will most likely be fixed in an upcoming patch, and I haven't noticed any other horrible bugs.But the second biggest problem I have with this port is the extremely lacking texture quality. Promising ""HD textures"" was a flat out lie. The game does have some slightly upscaled textures, but it mostly feel like they took the models, items, and about 50 of the most common assets and polished them up a bit. So I hope graphics aren't a big deal for you, because you certainly won't be getting your moneys worth there. Some guy took it upon himself to make his own HD textures for the Wii version using Photoshop and his textures look BETTER than what people at Capcom are being PAID to do! And he's doing it by himself! Utterly disgraceful.So, in review:Pros+Good gameplay+Decent mouse support +Achievments and LeaderboardsCons-Limited graphics settings-Subtitles option is displayed in the graphics menu, but cannot be turned on (WTF)-Poor texture quality -Locked at either 30 or 60 FPS, no in between or above-50/50 chance a QTE will use the X and C keys, a very strange choice considering most QTEs are instant death and people would not be prepared to reach down and hit both X and C (it feels like it doesn't even work sometimes)If this game is availible to you on another medium (Wii, Gamecube, PlayStation 2, or the other HD versions on 360/PS3) I'd recommend those over this half-baked port.

Attempted to get support for this game... only to find out it was produced by Ubisoft and none of the support links work.

												I went ahead and preordered this game because I'm a huge fan of RE4. It is probably in my all time top 5 games. In the end however I'm pretty disappointed. I hope they continue to patch and improve on this game for the PC. I've completed this game on the Gamecube, PS2 and Wii.  So far the Wii wins.I would give this game three out of five stars for the PC version. For one, serious sound issues for me.  The dialouge is entirely out of synch with the cutscenes. As far as gameplay I'm really conflicted. Part of me thinks that it's just really difficult to make that transition of WASD -- A and D being strafe left and right instead of turning left and right. This REALLY messes with me and I can't really fault the developers on that because that's just the way the game was designed. So, part of it is just getting used to the controls. However there seems to be other issues that I can't really put my finger on. I love the new textures but they certainly don't make the game.  There's something about the controls that leave something left to be desired. I feel like a 3rd rate gamer when playing this version.Granted I need to give this game some more play time.  Perhaps I just need to adapt to the controls.  As it is though, I would recommend you dust off that old GC, PS2, or hopefully if you have it, that Wii edition. Otherwise, wait for this to go on sale -- in retrospect that is what I would do.			"

Very dark and disturbing, Incredibly Immersive and amazing frantic survival horror/action gameplay. It is also considered by some to be the high point of this amazing series. You probably know all this already. What you may not know is how great this port is. looks down right GORGEOUS in 1080p at 60 frames a second with brand new HD textures. Also surprised at how well this plays on keyboard and mouse as well. Just... buy this game. If you have never played it, treat yourself to one of the greatest games in gaming history.			"

												Excellent. Not perfect, but excellent. Capcom delivers with this port. If you liked Resident Evil 5 or 6, this is a must buy.Some people may cite it lacking certain graphical elements, however in spite of this the game looks great. Arguably the effects will be missed, but going back to the Wii version won't feel the same without HD and 60fps.Ultimately, this PC port shows that Resident Evil 4 has aged remarkably well. Though it will never be a COD or a BF, we need to remember that it was never meant to be. One of the godfathers of ""over-the-shoulder"" 3rd person shooter, this port of RE4 brings the masterpiece to PC gamers and sharpens features that were sadly lacking in the PS3/360 HD ports.			"

I played the campaign 4 times in the Wii and now doing my 5th on PC.HOWEVER, as fun as the game is. This port is just terrible. KB&M controls are below average and sometimes right after I hold the aim button the screen just pans to the left, and I haven't even moved my mouse yet. The game goes all slow mo for me when I play it in 60 fps (well im palying it on my laptop). They say it's HD but it's not much of an HD... but that doesnt realy bother me too much. I really really really hope the devs will release a patch soon.. please.With that said, as horrible the controls may be.. I'm still gonna play it because it's Resident Evil 4.			"

												Resident Evil 4 is definatly a good game, if you dont have it or want to upgrade from GameCube or PS2 version I'd say buy it. It is the same Resi 4 as before and it is still as good, if that is what you want then I recomend it. Mouse and keyboard is totaly playable, there is full mouse suport in the menus and gameplay but not in the save/load screen or the inventory. The inventory in this port is annoying overall; backspace to pick up items, page down to rotate, Tab does back out of some menus but not others.  This is a much better PC port than the last one but there are some technical problems it has. The games run speed seems to be tied to the FPS, which defaults to 60. Any lower and the game runs noticably slower. FPS drops to about 40 during rainy/water filled areas.Having any kind of post prossesing or AA will drop your framerate by a small amount. The game will look much smoother if you turn these options off. I suggest you turn off AA anyway as it appears to put a grain filter over the whole game while its active.Overall I think if you want resi 4 again and can put up with the technical issues go ahead and buy it, if you cant overlook these problems or have a low end machine that will struggle to run it at full res 60 FPS then you should probably avoid this port.

Even if it's the one hundred walkthrough, it never gets old. For me, it has that special feel of chaos and mistakes done at every gunfires. Without a doubt, RE4 got reworked everywhere and i've got every single version of it. Seeing it evolve from assignment ada, to separate ways. It was like DLC's, but console in consoles till i get this reworked PC version. Should you get it? Of course, if you don't you'll probably be missing one of the greatest games from the 6th generation of gaming consoles. Whatever the graphics, modeling and animations. These Ganados are always fun to kill, making it tru the game again and again is not so bad and personally, if you get bored of it. Mercenaries mode is there to satisfy your needs of killing some more!			"

												The worst controls I've encountered in 28 years of gaming across over a dozen platforms. Some will call the controls ""old school"" which is a nostalgic way of saying outdated, or moreover, obsolete. If you've played any Dead Space games, this experience will be nothing short of infuriating while trying to use a keyboard and mouse. Do not buy this game unless you have a controller. The HD is not a big improvement. The atmosphere is unique and well done. Perhaps some day I'll come back to this if I have an Xbox controller handy. In the mean time, it's a complete waste. I should have gone with my gut and stayed clear of all things RE on PC. It's obvious the devs didn't have PC in mind. 3/10			"

												I used to love playing this game back when I had it on Gamecube. I didn't make it too far though cause I sucked at games back then. It was refreshing to visit this game now that I have gotten better at gaming. One major gripe I have with this PC port is the controls. Maybe it's just me but it takes a fortnight just to turn around and I tried playing it with my not Xbox controller for windows and it is ABYSMAL! So I played with just my keyboard and mouse and it was less trash, but still kind of trash. But in the end the controls didn't hinder the gameplay too much and I was still able to relive the glory days before I hated my life. So yeah definitely recommend! Just don't use a USB controller.

												Why did I get this game? For some reason, the frames are sooooo bad! And it's not like my computer is crappy, I can play Resident Evil Revelations without any problems. The worst I had with frame rate issues comes no where close to this. Even the menu has terrible frames. Maybe it's good for you, but not for me. I want my money back.			"

												Sou fã da franquia desde os anos 90, quando eu ainda era bem novo, por isso meu rage quando Resident Evil 4 virou modinha foi grande... Enquanto os 3 primeiros jogos abusavam do terror e temática pesada, sendo survival horror puro até o talo, Resident Evil 4 chegou trazendo Leon de Resident Evil 2 mais eminho do que nunca para salvar Ashley, a filha do presidente dos Estados Unidos da América. Nada de mortos-vivos, nada de puzzles claustrofóbicos e tensos e o cúmulo da gurizada todynho e trakinas: Agora é possível comprar armas!♥♥♥♥♥! Survival Horror não pode ter sistema de juntar moedinha pra comprar arminha não... A franquia sempre deixou isso bem claro, pois armas vc encontra pelo cenário, e as mais fodonas ficam em lugares fodões, cheio de sangue e monstros! Agora vc pode até tacar ovo de galinha nos inimigos, haha... Absurdo... Em termos de gráficos e jogabilidade o jogo deu um avanço, mas em trama, conteúdo de survival horror e dificuldade caiu MUITO! Por isso até um tempo atrás eu detestava esse game... Comprei na promoção da Steam pra zerar de novo quando eu estiver entediado, mas de um tempo pra cá eu venho pensando que a Capcom só queria inovar em algo e presentear os fãs, mas o problema é que esses fãs ridiculos e todynhos, trakinas leite com pêra enchem o saco idolatrando frescurinhas e ahh...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..Prós:-Gráficos legais-Easter Eggs e modo Mercenários bem legais-Além da campanha de Leon, temos a campanha da Ada também depois de zerar o game-Roupas desbloqueáveis-Muitas armas-Cenários bem grandes e detalhados que de vez em quando conseguem passar um clima de terror-Inimigo de Moto-Serra que lembra o maníaco do machado em RE: Outbreak File #2-Os modos Easy e Normal são interessantes... O normal possúi coisas que o Easy não tem, como um labirinto de cachorros no castelo e um cenário onde duas senhoras de moto-serra aparecem para perseguirem o jogador.Contras:-Puzzles fáceis-Personagem coadjuvante chata-Clima de Survival Horror dos jogos anteriores quase totalmente descartado, tendo em exceção apenas alguns cenários assustadores e poucas situações-Personagem principal passou por uma situação tensa a 6 anos atrás em uma cidade tomada pelos zumbis onde era apenas um policial comum e iniciante que demonstrava medo, tensão, etc... e agora é considerado um super Badass pela gurizada por motivos de criancisse-Pouquíssimas opções de alterações gráficas nesse porte HD para PCNota 6/10Recomendo pra que curte um shooter bacana, mas pra quem quer conhecer a franquia, recomendo começar pelos primeiros!

												The last PC port was crap, but this one...well better sorta.I'm gonna make this one short since this game has been around for a long time and it is one of my favorite Resident Evil games of all time. I'm gonna start off with the downs. I wouldn't really call this ""HD"" and reason is because the graphics look the same just some slight retextures. I can't really tell the difference since it all looked the same to me. The game is still not keyboard and mouse friendly, however, there are key customizing which is nice to have. I would highly recommend a 360 controller to play this game properly. The ups are that it supports 1080p resolution and goes up to 60 FPS. I am happy that the game's performance is outstanding, but at the same time I am disappointed the game is still unfriendly with keyboard + mouse. I'm lucky I have a 360 controller.7/10. Not the best port, but much better than the original PC port. For the 1080p and 60 FPS it's worth the $20. I still think the Wii version is still better lol.			"

												I have never written a review for a game on steam before but felt i needed to with this particular title. The game could have been very good were it not for the terrible controls both using keyboard and mouse and also with a game pad. Even tried the patched version which is supposed to improve the controls but does not. Do yourself a favor and avoid this title unless you want to struggle not to punch your monitor due to terrible controls.			"

												Well, after playing through the game several times, unlocking all the achievments, and doing more research into this, I've come to the conclusion that I cannot recommend Resident Evil 4 to everyone in its current state. Elaborating on that, I CAN recommend it to you if you have a very high-end PC. I mean higher than the Recommended specs listed on the store page, because this game is poorly optimized and will cause lag even if you have a decent computer that can run other high demand games at fair settings and a steady frame rate. Even setting the textures to SD and locking at 30FPS can still cause slowdown in some rooms.Slow down problems aside, the game is also moderatly buggy. Nothing game-breaking I've noticed so far, but after an event that takes the camera away from Leons back (such as being grabbed by an enemy), the camera will glitch out and be stuck in the position it took when you were grabbed until you move your mouse/analog stick around. That will most likely be fixed in an upcoming patch, and I haven't noticed any other horrible bugs.But the second biggest problem I have with this port is the extremely lacking texture quality. Promising ""HD textures"" was a flat out lie. The game does have some slightly upscaled textures, but it mostly feel like they took the models, items, and about 50 of the most common assets and polished them up a bit. So I hope graphics aren't a big deal for you, because you certainly won't be getting your moneys worth there. Some guy took it upon himself to make his own HD textures for the Wii version using Photoshop and his textures look BETTER than what people at Capcom are being PAID to do! And he's doing it by himself! Utterly disgraceful.So, in review:Pros+Good gameplay+Decent mouse support +Achievments and LeaderboardsCons-Limited graphics settings-Subtitles option is displayed in the graphics menu, but cannot be turned on (WTF)-Poor texture quality -Locked at either 30 or 60 FPS, no in between or above-50/50 chance a QTE will use the X and C keys, a very strange choice considering most QTEs are instant death and people would not be prepared to reach down and hit both X and C (it feels like it doesn't even work sometimes)If this game is availible to you on another medium (Wii, Gamecube, PlayStation 2, or the other HD versions on 360/PS3) I'd recommend those over this half-baked port.

												Best Resident evil game ever made ?!Of course it is !!As we were waiting long time a steam version of Re4,we got it and also in HD !Yeah the fps sometimes sucks at some moments,but that's  not quite important.Had this on pc in normal version and ps2,ah damn childhood hehe.But let's take a more look on it ! SPOILERS INCOMINGPositives-The upgrading system was introduced in this re for first time,and it's probably the only best upgrade system for weapons(in other residents i didn't like it much,except Re5 ,there it was same)-A lot of Weapons(From pistols to Cannons)-Mercenaries(one of my favorite Merc ever)-Seperate ways,because it's good to be back in those times when there were no dlc and that other bullcrap,it's nice to have things like this in game.-Graphics(at all it's good)-Best final boss fight ?! (for me it was)Negatives-yet the GRAPHICS AGAIN (as it is good,it is also bad ....)-fps drop on some scenes and locations(even with gaming pc [doesn't matter what i have,it's gaming XD] there are still few drops in some locations and scenes,mostly times during some boss fight starts.-Leaderboards(what kind of board is this...)Yet that'S probably all i can say.After this playthrough i never had any crash so it's good,because the old versions had many crashes hehe.But yet at least i heard once again WELCOME ,what do ya sellin ?!I highly Recommend this to ya ,unless you are a little piece of (gaben would ban me for this) so i will sayunless you are a little kid that doesn't know what good game is !ALL WHAT YOU NEED IS SAVE ASHLEY or you will hear LEOoooooooooon HElp !!

												First, the game: if you haven't played RE4, it's the game that reinvented the series and set it on its tracks to mindless action shooter series, but for the case of this one game they really got it right, between the enemies, weapons, atmosphere, and controls. It's so campy and the combat is so visceral that it rarely feels like a horror game, but there's just enough challenge to keep a tense atmosphere. Almost a decade later, this still holds up quite well.Now, the port: It's passable. It's a pretty no-frills drag-and-drop job of I guess the already-HD 360 rerelease from a while ago, ostensibly with a new 60 FPS option... but in practice you may well end up having to turn down your graphics settings including framerate because either the port is HORRIBLY optimized or there's some major issue somewhere cropping up for a lot of people that's causing catastrophic slowdown. After cranking it down I was able to get a couple chapters in mostly without issue. Controls work fine despite what all the gripers are saying, gamepad works exactly as it was originally designed and M+KB works akin to the Wii port, minus the tacked-on crosshair.Presently I'd wait to see if they can hammer out the slowdown issue, but otherwise recommended.

I've watched my friend's play it on Twitch many times and was excited to experience it myself, and I had a lot of fun in the time that I could play it. But unfortunately it crashes about every 10 minutes without fail! I've tried so many fixes suggested by the community, and I've seen that many many people have the same exact problem as me, and it prevents them from playing and enjoying the game!Edit: There is a fix

												I do recommend this game but the Devs have lied about it being HD it's the same textures as the gamecube verson only some tiny changes where made to key ingame textures thats it, and the controls are rubbish, keyboard and mouse keys are a mess and will get you killed most of the time and using a 360 controller takes a while to get used to,I give this game a rating of 5/10 is a great game but both PC ports ""Steam and Retail"" are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥would recommend the gamecube or PS2 verson of the game!!!

												Played it so many times on PS2 and PC that I actually lost the count. It's amazing to see the HD version on PC and now I'm enjoying it more than ever, thank you CAPCOM. Now we just need RE 1-3 to be relased in HD here on steam. <3			"

												I really wanted to like this game because I love the Resident Evil franchise but I really hate the control system. I like FPS and I like 3rd person shooters. This one is just awful no matter how it is configured. The movement is awkward (and that's putting it kindly). When aiming the gun or yielding a knife you cannot move at all, you have to stay rooted where you are! I mean really, you are holding a knife and the nut with an axe is getting strikes on you because you are rooted? And it's a battle just to get the character following the trail to and through the village - if I was observing from a distance it would look like a stumbling drunk person wandering in all directions.

												When I stop and think about it, Resi4 is probably my most played game of all time. This is strange because I've been playing games since the SNES, but yeah I've beaten Resi4 on the Wii somewhere around 30 times, not counting the hours in Mercenaries and the occasional dabbling into Separate Ways.I'm saying this as a bone fide veteran of Resi4, do not buy the Steam edition.For starters the keyboard and mouse controls for this game are godawful. Yes I know a gamepad is better, but when you're releasing what is effectively a 3rd person shooter on the PC, you're keyboard and mouse controls have got to ♥♥♥♥ing work.Plus the port feels very incomplete, for one there is bizarrely no mouse support for inventory menus. This means you have to guess how to move and sort your attache case, because nowhere does the game tell you how. I pressed keys at random and found out that left clicking, ""e"" or enter selects, backspace picks up, and I had to look up that PAGE DOWN rotates, really, page down, have you ever played a PC games that required you to press page down?And that's not even the worst part, the game is buggy as all hell, frame skipping is one thing, but even at the lowest settings the game can crash at any time for no reason, I had two crashes in just thirty minutes of gameplay and was done. Thank Gaben for Steam refund.Bottom line, play any other version of Resi4 over this, especially the Wii version as that's still the best IMHO. I know it's tempting to have the convenience of Steam but the game isn't worth by any measure, a complete failure.			"

												I had this game for the GameCube. This game is a freakin legend in the gaming community for a good reason... But the HD edition on the PC has its problems. I want to be clear that this might be an isolated incident and for you to try anyways. I could not progress further than the first el gigante boss fight (not a spoiler he has zero story importance aside from 'that's one big man baby!') the game would crash every single time he hit me and if he grabbed me the game would glitch out and would not progress or do anything, just sit there awkwardly while el gigante shook me around like a dog toy for all eternity. Cutscenes went out of sync with their audio and the game has forced frame rate caps. Who does that?! Seriously capcapom? Instead get this on the wii, or a console where hardware won't play a part in this because like I said I think this might be an isolated incident.			"

												I used to have this game on the wii but i sold it just to buy the pc version. It looks ok but ITS NOT HD!! . Theres barely any change on the textures. Its feels like an anisotropic filtering upgrade. If you know what anisotropic filtering is you will understand, if you dont know watch this video:

			AF or Anisotropic Filtering increases the quality of textures in video games particularly at extreme distances or angles.		

 . Theres still a lot of low res textures and the exact same glitches from the original. Buy it just if you like RE4 but if you are looking for a real hd remake dont buy it. Everyone knows RE4 is one of the best RE games but as i sad, theres barely any changes. Also this game has some overpowered system requirements, this game is 10 years old therefore it should be able to run in a toaster.10/10 game5/10 graphics upgrade			"

												Absolutely Shoddy Rehashed Piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I shouldn't have to buy a controller to play a PC Version of a Game.I enjoyed Resident Evil 4. On the Gamecube that is, i'd argue that its a superior version compare to whatever buggy shoddily made mess this is. Most of the ingame resources stay the same from the original and adds very little of substance. HD Graphics you cry? They really really really really aren't as good they seem. I have multiple problems with running this game.The Sound doesn't Sync with the Voices.A Absolute ♥♥♥♥ing annoyance, it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off and often confused me in the Quicktime Events.Its a carnal sin to release a game like this, imagine Final Fantasy 13 (""oh yeah great game"") with most of the dialogue ingame not synching up to the voices. It would constantly♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, wondering who was talking what.The ♥♥♥♥ing controls.by god i have never ever seen such a ♥♥♥♥ed up control set for a Third Person Game. The Menus run horribly and aiming towards a headshot, man your literally better off stitching your own nipples together and ripping them off in the pure fury of the Mouse Lag. It really really is just about bareable. Its another ♥♥♥♥ing sin that you require a Controller to play this acursed release. Hell, if you bought this for the sole reason of using a controller on it? Just get a ♥♥♥♥ing emulator or hell DO ANYTHING but buy this god damn game. It Controls TERRIBLY.Im not gonna lie, i loved the original console versions but thanks to this release im never trusting Capcom again with a PC Release if my life depended on it. I'd rather throw myself into a ♥♥♥♥ing river than have to deal with the amounts of issues this game has. I'd probably have twice as much fun with it too. I don't honestly have the care or the amount of time to fix it.Capcom is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing money grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥s and im not trusting them with another re-release until they ♥♥♥♥ing get it right for god damn once.

												Ummm... Resident Evil 4, one of the greatest video games of all time?  Who wouldn't buy it?  Now on to a serious note.  There are some minor bugs.   But even compared to a Bethesda game this game works well, very well.  My hat off to Capcom personally.  Some people seem to have major issues, most have very minor issues if even that.   I for one had well no real issues.  1 CTD, 1 Slow Down, with max settings during the entire duration of the game so far.   I find the mouse aiming controls working wonderful, 30FPS setting it seems to aim faster, while 60FPS setting it's slower but easier to manage well.   Quick Time Events, are well Quick Time Events, the most Hated Thing in the game, is still my most hated thing in the game... Quick Time Events.  Controls for them take a bit of getting used to, but I only died vs Krauser 3 times which is a personal best.I have to say this is the easiest Resident Evil 4 I've ever played.  Mouse aiming truly helps a lot.  Shooting Range was a Cake Walk, getting head/knee shots is a snap.   Performance as I said earlier for me as been wonderful, even with this 5 year old PC.   There are some minor graphic issues, noticable textures which stand out even with the HD textures being on that look bad, but common the game came out in what? Almost a Decade ago?  Even with improved textures for much of the game.  Without them it is still an awesome game and complaining about the texture quality which is obviously better than the other PC version, well complaining about it is just stupid in my opinion.    I pity anyone who complains about this game.  I think it's wonderful.			"

												don't buy this crap! I thought with the HD remake that you could control the gun with the mouse instead of what capcom/UBISOFT did in the original boxed pc version of the game where there was no mouse control and all was controlled by the keyboard. All they did was allow you to do with the mouse is move the camera around (not a head or gun camera like re5 and re6, more like a free floating camera) which screws you up if you are used to the mouse being head/gun control like re5 and re6.

There is some terrible gamma problems too but it only was blarringly obvious like 3 times throughout the whole game.  Still a great game for the noslagia kids out there, i was for the msot part always at 60 frames with minimal graphical errors.  Get it!			"

												Played it on the Wii and really enjoyed it.  Bought the PC HD version to see how it looked on better hardware, but like many others, found the controls too awful to use.Tried a 360 controller, the default keyboard & mouse and the alternative keyboard & mouse option detailed in the forum - all equally bad.  Despite being able to complete the game on the Wii, I couldn't even get out of the first village in this new version.Great game, awful controls on the HD remaster.  Unplayable for me.			"

												don't buy this crap! I thought with the HD remake that you could control the gun with the mouse instead of what capcom/UBISOFT did in the original boxed pc version of the game where there was no mouse control and all was controlled by the keyboard. All they did was allow you to do with the mouse is move the camera around (not a head or gun camera like re5 and re6, more like a free floating camera) which screws you up if you are used to the mouse being head/gun control like re5 and re6.

												When I played RE4 for the first time on the game cube back in the day I played it front to back, at my friends house after a 2 day lan party with no sleep. Probably my favorite game of all time. I cannot recommend it enough to anyone who has not played it. It completely redefined the horror genre and spawned many clones that will never even come close to the stress inducing horrific mayhem of RE4.... Im looking at you Dead Space.			"

												I never got around to playing Resident Evil 4 when it originally came out on the Gamecube so I was happy when they announced the Ultimate HD Edition. In fact, the only Resident Evil game I've beaten is 5, and I watched a friend play through the first one in its entirety, so having only really experienced those two, I wasn't sure what to expect with 4. I know it received massive acclaim when it was released because it completely changed the formula for the series, so I was kind of expecting something a bit less.... cliched. This game is just full of cliches and goes on to make fun of those cliches. It's kind of surreal.I think Leon is arguably the coolest character in the Resident Evil series and the writers definitely know that when they decided he was going to be a government agent after the Raccoon City events. He's sly and makes stupid puns, but is intelligent and quick thinking. The fact that he's sent to find the President's daughter in a Spanish village sounds normal enough. But things are obviously not normal when he gets there. The game starts off like a survival horror, but immediately, I stopped being terrified as it was clear that there's more action for our ""action hero"". Leon is ultimately painted as an action hero, and boy oh boy, the in game villains can not stop referencing that. The basic story is that, as I've stated, he's sent by the US to find the President's recently captured daughter, Ashley Graham (she's quite the character too) and he does it, obviously. There's more to this village though, they've been all infected by some parasite, Las Plagas. Instead of the slow, dreary zombies, we have psychopathic Spanish people that wanna kill you. As the game progresses, you face different variations of these people as well as the people in the cult that are behind it and some military types. It gets pretty weird really fast. I mean, this game blends the survival horror trope with weird religious cult attitude and a high conspiracy plot potentially involving Umbrella. It's loads of fun but definitely off the walls insane. Which is exactly why I love it. The gameplay is a huge shift from the first three Resident Evil titles and the completely bizarre setting is what makes it so unique. Plus Ada is in it and she's so cool. Like, really, they could have called this game ""Resident Cool"" because all of the coolest characters are in this game.9.5/10			"

												Despite what my play count is on Steam, trust me, I've put a whole ton more hours in on the PS2 version. I'm going to give you information on the game as from what i've experienced so far: The graphics are stunning in HD, but here's the catch: Runin 60 FPS, and you'll be feeling like it's constant slow motion. I don't know if it's just my system, but hey, Just throwing it out there. I haven't tried 30 FPS yet, but I do plan on doing that. You get CUSTOM mouse acceleration, quite a few differnet resolutions to play at... The ability to rebind your keyboard keys if you want to play the game with a keyboard and mouse. When I put the game on ""fixed 60 FPS,"" the opening cutscene became out of synch at somepoint, but yet again, I don't know if it's my own hardware that's doing that injustice. This is an oldie by now, but it's a goodie! Better than Resident evil 5, I can tell you that! "

												OK, I'll just say Resident Evil is fantastic in terms of atmosphere, mystery, story and setting. I really enjoy the game and have played it many times on different settings.But, one thing that's particularly annoying NOW are the damn controls!!!  I mean, they were always a little wonkey on the PS2, but you could get used to them after a while. Now it's been ported to the PC, and the controls still SUCK!!! And how about a manual to explain the key layout? Would it really be that hard??? The mouse is laggy, even when you've got the speed cranked way up (mine's at 30), but the movemenet controls are just slow and not great. I think they could have done a much better job, and the fact is, they should have.			"

												Great game since i first played back in the PS2 days. I've been modding the living hell out of the PC version to get it to look good, but keep everything original. This is done very well. It looks amazing! I have collected 8Gb worth of patches over a month of searching for the original PC version. When I say this game looks great, then take it from me. It looks great! PLUS, it has all the extras from the original version: Seperate Ways, Assignment Ada and The Mercenaries mode!CONS:Mouse controls are painful. Took a while getting used to it, but sometimes, the mouse goes crazy, especially while trying to move the camera and aim.The quicktime events are a PAIN on keyboard. ""X+C"" is a nightmare! This cannot be remapped!Slow Mo after coming out of the inventory or from pause menu sometimes. This is disappointing.(I really hope a patch fixes all these)			"

												In order to help commemorate the release of the “Ultimate HD Edition” of Resident Evil 4 on Steam this week, I figured I’d post about how awesome this game is. It's actually difficult for me to put my finger on why I like this game so much. On paper, it seems like a game I would absolutely hate. The story is pretty much ridiculous. The puzzles feel tacked on and unnecessary. There's instant death quick time events in cutscenes. All things I hate. Plus it's a shooter, and I'm not usually enthralled with action/shooters. But somehow this game really won me over and became one of my favorites. Resident Evil 4 marked a huge shift in the franchise's gameplay. RE 1-3 were really more pure survival horror games. Ammo was scarce. Enemies were scarce, which made it more intense when you encountered one. Aiming was kind of awkward which gave a real sense of vulnerability. The emphasis was on atmosphere and trying to creep the player out. I liked these games, especially the first Resident Evil. RE4 is a very different kind of game. There's enemies all over the place, the controls are tight, and the emphasis is on the shooting and action. It's a different kind of fun. It still does atmosphere sort of well through the first half of the game, but kind of abandons it through the second half in my opinion. What I think this game does very well is variety. Variety in enemies, variety in weapons, variety in locations and so on. While I think RE4 does some sections of the game better than others, at least you never get the sense that you're doing the same thing over and over which I frequently get while playing shooters. There's the atmospheric lonely feeling of the village in the beginning of the game, the creepy cultists in the castle, the unnerving bizarre science experiments in the laboratory and the over the top action sequences near the end of the game. There are lots of unique and memorable experiences in RE4. There's everything from being trapped in a cabin with legions of zombies trying to break in to running from an invisible monster through dimly lit sewers. There's even epic gigantic boss fights and a few vehicle sections as well. It's not as nerve-wrackingly scary as the first RE games, but there are a few jump scares scattered throughout RE4. There's a sort of fun metagame of deciding which weapons and items you'll take with you with limited inventory space. And deciding which guns to upgrade and which upgrades to purchase is fun too. It's just good old zombie killing fun. Check it outFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												This game is probably the best game i've ever played. I don't know why, but other games i'll only play through once or twice. This one though, i've beat it at least 10 times on PS2, Gamecube, and 360 each, and I hope to continue that with the PC version. The story is fantastic, the gameplay is amazingly fun, it is just an all around fantastic game. I really would reccommend it to anyone. It truly has the most replayability that i've ever seen in a game. I know I have alot of games I say are my favorites (Assassins Creed II, Kingdom Hearts, Deus Ex, and more) this is the only one I can play over and over without getting bored of it.It also has a good amount of unlockable content, such as; costumes,weapons, modes(mercenaries, Assignment Ada, Seperate Ways, etc.). The game is reasonably challenging on the normal difficulty, but it really kicks it up a notch with PROFESSIONAL difficulty. Thankfully, the game allows you to start every game with your old weapons, so it's still fun.My only complaint is that EVERY boss can be one shotted with a rocket launcher. It just seems dumb to me. But, it doesnt detract from the game, so who cares.Overall i would give this game an 11/10. Easily the best game I've ever played. Now, if only they would put all the other older ones on here.			"

He is not really cheese, if that helps you face him.9/10 would buy for full price (even at full price!)			"

												Although not my favourite Resident Evil title, I have been thoroughly looking forward to this release; especially since switching to PC gaming has sadly caused me to miss out on classics such as Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil etc.The store page on Steam states that resident Evil 4 features the following:-Stunning HD running at a smooth 60 frames per second for the first time. -A complete visual overhaul has been performed to bring this revered title to the highest graphical quality ever. -Fully optimized for the wide screen, texts have been sharpened and textures have been upgraded on characters, backgrounds and in-game objects. -Steam platform support with Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Steam Trading Cards, global leaderboards, and full game controller support. -Native keyboard and mouse support with customizable key binding, mouse sensitivity, and mouse acceleration settings. - This new PC version will include everything from the prior iterations including subtitle support in English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish as well as previously released bonus content such as the Separate Ways epilogue.Now, I personally would not call it “stunning” – the new textures are okay but nothing to write home about. Yes, they are an upgrade from the original’s blurry, illegible textures (some of which still remain) but they still look dated and fairly low resolution; not to mention some of the old broken-down and dirty textures have been replaced with much cleaner, out of place textures. Luckily, for some users, Capcom offers a choice between original and “HD” textures. On the positive side, the user interface and text do look much sharper and easier on the eyes – far superior in quality to the original game.This isn’t helped by the “Motion Blur” setting. Usually I am a fan of such an option, but I know many people love it or hate it. Sadly in RE4 it’s a very low quality blur, almost giving the impression of a lower frame rate. Luckily this option is completely optional, as Resident Evil 4 does a good job of allowing users to change texture quality, shadows, anti aliasing etc.A comparison between the “HD” and “SD” textures can be found  [HERE] [www.capcom-unity.com]It is far from a “complete visual overhaul” – especially when compared to games such as Final Fantasy X | X-2 HD Remaster, which not only reworked textures, they improved pre-rendered backgrounds, completely replaced low poly LOD meshes with higher polygon versions and even went the extra mile to completely re-arrange the old MIDI tracks with a full orchestral sound track.On to the “Native keyboard and mouse support” - Sadly this is where things get more disappointing. Although Capcom have added the ability to turn mouse acceleration on or off, it’s rather moot as the mouse aiming feels like it’s just emulating  XINPUT commands, causing floaty, clunky aiming that feels far from “native.”The most irritating issue regarding controls is that mouse support is completely absent from menu screens, such as the inventory management. Instead, you must use WASD to move the cursor around the grid based attaché case, press E to select it, Page Up and Page Down to rotate and E again to place back down. This is vastly disappointing, I would have expected to simply have a drag and drop system where I can freely move objects with the mouse.The game is fully compatible with an Xbox 360 controller, so at least that’s an option if the mouse issues are too much, and unlike the original PC port – This version correctly displays newly textured prompts to correspond with using a controller. No more “Press Button 8 to dodge”.I must admit, however, even on controller, the control-scheme has not aged well. Like most people, I’ve been spoiled by modern systems, fluid 360-degree motion and 3D camera systems as opposed to Resident Evil 4′s tank controls. I don’t remember the original being so clunky but I’m quite certain that’s due to the system being fairly good for it’s time back then. I wouldn’t class this as a negative, however. It uses the same controls as the original, and if I enjoyed it so much back then I’m sure I just need to get back to grips with an older style of play.Complaints aside, running Resident Evil 4 at native 1080p at 60fps is a great thing. I cannot imagine myself going back to the 30fps version, and I would go as far as saying, despite its flaws, this is the definitive version of Resident Evil 4. Especially when compared to the original PC port.			"

												A solid game that stray away from the original formula that was used in previous Resident Evil games and that we knew and loved. The third person mechanic works well to still provide that horror game feel while being a little more action based. The HD update looks very nice in comparison to the original game and allows you to immerse yourself more into the game. While it doesn't contain any zombies, it is still a very solid game that you should definitely play (or even re-play). 8.5/10			"

												I'll preface this by saying that the only other version I've played is the Wii version, and that I play with an Xbox 360 controller.The first time I played it, I thought it was an amazing game. Years later, and an 'HD' upgrade, I still think the same of it. It is not a perfect port, and there are issues. On the whole, however, it remains the same fantastic game it ever was.Whilst it is called 'HD', not all textures were given the same amount of love and attention. Numerous other reviews detail this, but when you see the better textures juxtaposed with textures which were not updated, it looks jarring. They touted that the text on the grenades can be read, but frankly I could not care less about this. On the whole, the textures are an upgrade - I just wish they had spent more time doing ALL the textures (or at least making them somewhat better). Another niggle is the poor background textures during the game. This is most noticeable in the Castle area, and it's a shame, frankly. I wouldn't expect intricately detailed backgrounds, but something better than what was provided on consoles that could manage 640x480 only would have been nice. Furthermore, the frame limiters are too 'literal'. They are not caps, but actual limiters. If your computer is not capable of 60fps when you set the limit to 60fps, the game will play in slow motion. This makes it smooth, but ruins the experience. I'd rather it let the framerate drop below 60fps (or 30fps, if that's your limit) to allow gameplay to be at a consistent speed.I was never into speedrunning as a concept - I enjoy looking around and discovering new things - but with this version I decided to bite the bullet - and happily the glitches have been left in (the ones which help speedruns, but don't ruin normal gameplay).The gameplay is as it has ever been, which is to say fantastic. Some lament the fact that you cannot move and aim/shoot, but this adds to the tension imo. Lack of a FOV option isn't too bad - I've never had problems with limited field of view (whilst some have), but I like being able to see more of what's around me) - because again, it adds to the tension.There are some strange minor issues, but I would recommend it if you've never played it before, or if you want a better PC version than existed before. Keyboard and Mouse users may want to hold off for a while however, since some are complaining about the support for K&M setups.			"

												Well worth a revisit but oh my - the controls!!!I was under the impression this was going to bring the game into the present in terms of updated visuals and mouse/keyboard control. Well, be warned. The control system is so incredibly frustrating; much as it was using the arrow keys to aim in my original retail copy.  Mouse doesn't control movement, WASD does. This control set is known as 'Tank Controls' apparently and this is how it plays. Imaging driving a tank around a multi-story car park...Still enjoying it though and it's well worth the money but I wish they had upgraded the mouse control more.			"

												I think a lot of people here writing negative reviews are all based on controls, however, I believe it isn't the controls so much as what they expected. You can compare the controls of say, the original Mario to the Original sonic, because they are both platformers. You can't really compare the controls of this game to any other game because it is a pretty unique style. I think a lot of people expected a high sensitivity FPS style control where Leon does 360s. But that's not how it was on PS2/GC so why would they change that now? Personally I have had minimal problems with controls, it just takes some time getting used to. Really the knife is the only one that bothered me and that I got used to.That being said, this is the greatest zombie killing survival horror/action game ever. It's flawless, if you've never played it before, you would be doing yourself a great deed by playing it.			"

												""The Ultimate HD edition"" it lives up to it's name. This game works perfectly with both controller and mouse and keyboard. A survivial horror game that delivers on the survival. The vast need for ammo and save points keeps you going and when you find one, you'll be the happiest person alive. The rush of Resident Evil 4 is like nothing I have ever experienced. With a story that may seem cliche', 'Save the presidents daughter' but you start to feel for both the main characters, Leon and Ashley as they go through the game trying to get off the island that is overrun with a destrucrive and infected cult. Not interested yet? How about some quick time events, gorgeous cutscenes, an atmosphere that will leave your spine tingling. And what about the sound of a chainsaw from the distant knowing the person holding it, is out to cut your head off? I recommend Resident Evil 4 to anyone and everyone. It's known as the 'last true Resident Evil' and believe me, it's one of the best.Just play it.			"

												Ultimate HD as a port:Resident Evil 4 is a game that has been ported nearly as much as Duke 3D at this pointResident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition (or as steam calls it resident evil 4/biohazard 4) has a dislike by purists calling the Wii version superior and the this port awful.Which is pretty harsh considering RE4s last venture to Windows.I can't help but disagree though as my experience replaying this game was much better than playing on the previous console versions.Its nearly identical to the Wii Version in terms of content featuring all the modes and costumes.The differences really come down to the speed and look of the game, which has changed in this portUltimate HD really pushes the fact that its now 60 fps, and thats mostly true excluding a fair amount of animations that seem unoptimized for the transition (Granted the game still allows a fixed 30fps for those who want a more vanilla experience). Another thing HD has is 'HD' textures, which is a stretch being only some of the games textures are actually given this treatment, and as with any makeover it changes some of the original look. Its also somewhat jarring to see some of the HD textures next to clearly unchanged texture. I can't justify complaining too much about this either as the original textures are still an option and there is already a fan made one up for download. The color looks warmer but there are 4 color filters, the last looking more similar to the Wii/Gamecube version and there is a fan made color filter made to emulate the Wii/Gamecube look. I hear some people having issues with quick time events and other button prompts at 60 fps, but having played this with the current patch with a 360 controller I have had no issues.I also have heard of slow downs and crashing, and I haven't had those either.The one thing I can agree with is poor keyboard and mouse controls, having played this with a 360 controller though, I had no issues with the presets given. Another small quip is that you there is no quit to desktop from the game pause menu, as its set up similar to the console version.I really only have 2 complaints aside from K+M controls:1. No English subtitles, which is a real bummer for me as the option was in all previous versions and I generally have difficulty with dialogue.2. The Steam overlay has some sort of issue with this game, it really doesn't work.The game is only slightly taxing to my PC at max settings giving me no problem performance wise, I really think most the complaints come from the port upon launch.In short: This isn't The Silent Hill HD Collection, pretty much all of the changes can all be reverted and there is a purpose to this port as the last Windows port was pretty much garbage without fan mods/patches. All the content is here and I would argue that its the best version of Resident Evil 4, even though its mainly just because it contains the same game, ready to play on PC without the ABSOLUTE NEED to mod but still the ability to.

												don't buy this crap! I thought with the HD remake that you could control the gun with the mouse instead of what capcom/UBISOFT did in the original boxed pc version of the game where there was no mouse control and all was controlled by the keyboard. All they did was allow you to do with the mouse is move the camera around (not a head or gun camera like re5 and re6, more like a free floating camera) which screws you up if you are used to the mouse being head/gun control like re5 and re6.

												There's always that one game you pretty much know inside out, for me it's Resident Evil 4.That being said, I am by no means a professional player here. I'm still scared of levels, I still dread encounters I know are coming, and I still end up missing a great deal of my targets - but it's fun.INSANE fun. Try using one gun, or only eggs, or using no health or upgrades and just running away.This may have lead to the decline of the series but at least it set a noteable benchmark.Monsters, Guns, Upgrading, Headshots, Horror, Cults, Inventories, Attractive Girls and plenty of Gore. I think that equals a well earned: Heck Yes!			"

												This game is probably the best game i've ever played. I don't know why, but other games i'll only play through once or twice. This one though, i've beat it at least 10 times on PS2, Gamecube, and 360 each, and I hope to continue that with the PC version. The story is fantastic, the gameplay is amazingly fun, it is just an all around fantastic game. I really would reccommend it to anyone. It truly has the most replayability that i've ever seen in a game. I know I have alot of games I say are my favorites (Assassins Creed II, Kingdom Hearts, Deus Ex, and more) this is the only one I can play over and over without getting bored of it.It also has a good amount of unlockable content, such as; costumes,weapons, modes(mercenaries, Assignment Ada, Seperate Ways, etc.). The game is reasonably challenging on the normal difficulty, but it really kicks it up a notch with PROFESSIONAL difficulty. Thankfully, the game allows you to start every game with your old weapons, so it's still fun.My only complaint is that EVERY boss can be one shotted with a rocket launcher. It just seems dumb to me. But, it doesnt detract from the game, so who cares.Overall i would give this game an 11/10. Easily the best game I've ever played. Now, if only they would put all the other older ones on here.			"

												So I just got through my first run of the game, I got interested in the franchise of Resident Evil a while back cause the YouTube channel Game Grumps played the REmaster so I watched it and decided to get this game as it was on sale, I just got around spending the past 2 days dedicating all my time to it and I've got to say although I dont feel as if this game is a masterpiece, the gameplay is extremely solid and fun, I've heard in the Resident Evil community that this either comes along to most as the best RE game or the worst because it took a turn for the franchise, I can't say since I dont have too much experience with any of them except watching the REmaster of the first and beating the fourth myself. As a casual gamer I considered this to be a 9/10, im really getting into the franchise because of this game now and look forward to beating the rest this following year, possible cons I might list that might bother people but not really meBad voice acting (in some scenearios) and just weird dialouge in generalNot too much context or story as I would've wanted, but then again that helped with keeping the game fun soo personal prefrence.Just not enough explanation is my complaint really, I mean im not a reviewer per say, but I really did have fun with the game, the best way to describe what I consider a 10/10 game to be, would be that it would contain such fun and diverse gameplay and can really drive my emotion and connect with the characters which I felt this game lacked but dont think they were aiming for in the first place to begin with.Just buy the game if its on sale, even if its not the regular cost is already a bit cheap, you wont regret it :) "

												Although not my favourite Resident Evil title, I have been thoroughly looking forward to this release; especially since switching to PC gaming has sadly caused me to miss out on classics such as Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil etc.The store page on Steam states that resident Evil 4 features the following:-Stunning HD running at a smooth 60 frames per second for the first time. -A complete visual overhaul has been performed to bring this revered title to the highest graphical quality ever. -Fully optimized for the wide screen, texts have been sharpened and textures have been upgraded on characters, backgrounds and in-game objects. -Steam platform support with Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Steam Trading Cards, global leaderboards, and full game controller support. -Native keyboard and mouse support with customizable key binding, mouse sensitivity, and mouse acceleration settings. - This new PC version will include everything from the prior iterations including subtitle support in English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish as well as previously released bonus content such as the Separate Ways epilogue.Now, I personally would not call it “stunning” – the new textures are okay but nothing to write home about. Yes, they are an upgrade from the original’s blurry, illegible textures (some of which still remain) but they still look dated and fairly low resolution; not to mention some of the old broken-down and dirty textures have been replaced with much cleaner, out of place textures. Luckily, for some users, Capcom offers a choice between original and “HD” textures. On the positive side, the user interface and text do look much sharper and easier on the eyes – far superior in quality to the original game.This isn’t helped by the “Motion Blur” setting. Usually I am a fan of such an option, but I know many people love it or hate it. Sadly in RE4 it’s a very low quality blur, almost giving the impression of a lower frame rate. Luckily this option is completely optional, as Resident Evil 4 does a good job of allowing users to change texture quality, shadows, anti aliasing etc.A comparison between the “HD” and “SD” textures can be found  [HERE] [www.capcom-unity.com]It is far from a “complete visual overhaul” – especially when compared to games such as Final Fantasy X | X-2 HD Remaster, which not only reworked textures, they improved pre-rendered backgrounds, completely replaced low poly LOD meshes with higher polygon versions and even went the extra mile to completely re-arrange the old MIDI tracks with a full orchestral sound track.On to the “Native keyboard and mouse support” - Sadly this is where things get more disappointing. Although Capcom have added the ability to turn mouse acceleration on or off, it’s rather moot as the mouse aiming feels like it’s just emulating  XINPUT commands, causing floaty, clunky aiming that feels far from “native.”The most irritating issue regarding controls is that mouse support is completely absent from menu screens, such as the inventory management. Instead, you must use WASD to move the cursor around the grid based attaché case, press E to select it, Page Up and Page Down to rotate and E again to place back down. This is vastly disappointing, I would have expected to simply have a drag and drop system where I can freely move objects with the mouse.The game is fully compatible with an Xbox 360 controller, so at least that’s an option if the mouse issues are too much, and unlike the original PC port – This version correctly displays newly textured prompts to correspond with using a controller. No more “Press Button 8 to dodge”.I must admit, however, even on controller, the control-scheme has not aged well. Like most people, I’ve been spoiled by modern systems, fluid 360-degree motion and 3D camera systems as opposed to Resident Evil 4′s tank controls. I don’t remember the original being so clunky but I’m quite certain that’s due to the system being fairly good for it’s time back then. I wouldn’t class this as a negative, however. It uses the same controls as the original, and if I enjoyed it so much back then I’m sure I just need to get back to grips with an older style of play.Complaints aside, running Resident Evil 4 at native 1080p at 60fps is a great thing. I cannot imagine myself going back to the 30fps version, and I would go as far as saying, despite its flaws, this is the definitive version of Resident Evil 4. Especially when compared to the original PC port.			"

												A solid game that stray away from the original formula that was used in previous Resident Evil games and that we knew and loved. The third person mechanic works well to still provide that horror game feel while being a little more action based. The HD update looks very nice in comparison to the original game and allows you to immerse yourself more into the game. While it doesn't contain any zombies, it is still a very solid game that you should definitely play (or even re-play). 8.5/10			"

												Mouse movement is awful. Cutscenes sometimes delay making lips not match words, random frame drops even though it claims to be constant 60 fps. Textures are nice but the game is unstable. Capcom must patch this a bit. I love the game but this port is an utter dissapointment.			"

												16/6/16_______________So I gave the game another run since why not I spent my time to download it, the first part of this review was my first impression of the game, and even tho I dont meet recommended settings, minimum means it can still run (aimed of course), and yeah the port should really be ran at 60 fps to give it a much smoother experience.Now onto my over all review, the game it self is good, I'd recommend getting it if you like the franchise (since this is the one that changed the ""survival horror"" this franchise use to be) however be warned the game is more better off being played with a controller, with keyboard and mouse (excluding the mouse really) the controls feel almost clunky, this is why I'd recommend using a controller (even tho you can change the key bindings its still better off with one).After looking further into it, I've decided to give it a thumbs up review, as the game itself is an amazing creation that made me love the Resident evil franchise as a whole, while as my first impressions was negative.  But then again don't let 1 persons review determin if you want this game or not.15/6/16_______________I use to play this on the PS2 when it came out on it I loved the game completely, it felt so smooth and a hell of a lot easier to paly the game than it is on the PC.So Just to say my specs meet the minimum PC specs so I ran the game according to what I could, however when playing on the PC version of this, it feels severly clunky and no smooth transition between running and shooting, and honestly personally this feels like its not very well optimized for the PC port.

												Resident Evil 4 is probably (IMO) the best game in this perspective. It brings that creepy feeling you had when you played Resident Evil 1 or 2.. Especially when you are walking about in a huge place like the estate/castle (or whatever), hearing nothing but Leon and Ashley's footsteps and then suddenly.. ZOMBIE! I recommend it highly. 10/10. And IMO (once again), it's best to play with a controller. Gives you that console feeling from back in the old days. The storytelling is epic, the characters, zombies and the sub-bosses.. Just truly epic and outstanding. If you do not have this game, you are missing out on something truly epic (once again!).			"

												In a word:  Disappointing.While the storyline is good, the controls are absolute junk.  While it uses the WASD keys for movement the mouse only pans and requires entirely too much movement even when the sensitivity is cranked up.  There is no side-to-side movement, only rotation which makes trying to look in one direction while moving in another quite awkward.  “A” and “D” keys will rotate the player but nothing to sidestep.  Aiming is done over the shoulder style with a laser sight, instead of through the sights as is standard on first person shooters.  Moreover, you can not simultaneously move and shoot (or use knife).  You must aim, shoot, come off the sights, then move only to stop moving again in order to aim and shoot.  And just because you are looking straight at your enemy doesn’t mean your point of aim will be there when you do prepare to fire.  Expect to have to furiously pan around at times to figure out where your view rotated to.For those that have previously played the game on consoles and are looking forward to awkward controls, movement, and aiming, you may enjoy it.For someone who is used to more traditional controls and movement found in first person shooters, pass on this.  The unintuitive controls truly make for a miserable gameplay experience.  Instead of fighting enemies you spend your time fighting the controls.  So as a result, the game has an entertaining storyline, but it is lost to the cumbersome controls that should have been updated to reflect the standard keyboard and mouse setup of a PC.			"

												I really wanted to like this game because I love the Resident Evil franchise but I really hate the control system. I like FPS and I like 3rd person shooters. This one is just awful no matter how it is configured. The movement is awkward (and that's putting it kindly). When aiming the gun or yielding a knife you cannot move at all, you have to stay rooted where you are! I mean really, you are holding a knife and the nut with an axe is getting strikes on you because you are rooted? And it's a battle just to get the character following the trail to and through the village - if I was observing from a distance it would look like a stumbling drunk person wandering in all directions.

I'm still scared of levels, I still dread encounters I know are coming, and I still end up missing a great deal of my targets - but it's fun.INSANE fun. Try using one gun, or only eggs, or using no health or upgrades and just running away.This may have lead to the decline of the series but at least it set a noteable benchmark.Monsters, Guns, Upgrading, Headshots, Horror, Cults, Inventories, Attractive Girls and plenty of Gore.

												This game is probably the best game i've ever played. I don't know why, but other games i'll only play through once or twice. This one though, i've beat it at least 10 times on PS2, Gamecube, and 360 each, and I hope to continue that with the PC version. The story is fantastic, the gameplay is amazingly fun, it is just an all around fantastic game. I really would reccommend it to anyone. It truly has the most replayability that i've ever seen in a game. I know I have alot of games I say are my favorites (Assassins Creed II, Kingdom Hearts, Deus Ex, and more) this is the only one I can play over and over without getting bored of it.It also has a good amount of unlockable content, such as; costumes,weapons, modes(mercenaries, Assignment Ada, Seperate Ways, etc.). The game is reasonably challenging on the normal difficulty, but it really kicks it up a notch with PROFESSIONAL difficulty. Thankfully, the game allows you to start every game with your old weapons, so it's still fun.My only complaint is that EVERY boss can be one shotted with a rocket launcher. It just seems dumb to me. But, it doesnt detract from the game, so who cares.Overall i would give this game an 11/10. Easily the best game I've ever played. Now, if only they would put all the other older ones on here.			"

												So I just got through my first run of the game, I got interested in the franchise of Resident Evil a while back cause the YouTube channel Game Grumps played the REmaster so I watched it and decided to get this game as it was on sale, I just got around spending the past 2 days dedicating all my time to it and I've got to say although I dont feel as if this game is a masterpiece, the gameplay is extremely solid and fun, I've heard in the Resident Evil community that this either comes along to most as the best RE game or the worst because it took a turn for the franchise, I can't say since I dont have too much experience with any of them except watching the REmaster of the first and beating the fourth myself. As a casual gamer I considered this to be a 9/10, im really getting into the franchise because of this game now and look forward to beating the rest this following year, possible cons I might list that might bother people but not really meBad voice acting (in some scenearios) and just weird dialouge in generalNot too much context or story as I would've wanted, but then again that helped with keeping the game fun soo personal prefrence.Just not enough explanation is my complaint really, I mean im not a reviewer per say, but I really did have fun with the game, the best way to describe what I consider a 10/10 game to be, would be that it would contain such fun and diverse gameplay and can really drive my emotion and connect with the characters which I felt this game lacked but dont think they were aiming for in the first place to begin with.Just buy the game if its on sale, even if its not the regular cost is already a bit cheap, you wont regret it :) "

												Although not my favourite Resident Evil title, I have been thoroughly looking forward to this release; especially since switching to PC gaming has sadly caused me to miss out on classics such as Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil etc.The store page on Steam states that resident Evil 4 features the following:-Stunning HD running at a smooth 60 frames per second for the first time. -A complete visual overhaul has been performed to bring this revered title to the highest graphical quality ever. -Fully optimized for the wide screen, texts have been sharpened and textures have been upgraded on characters, backgrounds and in-game objects. -Steam platform support with Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Steam Trading Cards, global leaderboards, and full game controller support. -Native keyboard and mouse support with customizable key binding, mouse sensitivity, and mouse acceleration settings. - This new PC version will include everything from the prior iterations including subtitle support in English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish as well as previously released bonus content such as the Separate Ways epilogue.Now, I personally would not call it “stunning” – the new textures are okay but nothing to write home about. Yes, they are an upgrade from the original’s blurry, illegible textures (some of which still remain) but they still look dated and fairly low resolution; not to mention some of the old broken-down and dirty textures have been replaced with much cleaner, out of place textures. Luckily, for some users, Capcom offers a choice between original and “HD” textures. On the positive side, the user interface and text do look much sharper and easier on the eyes – far superior in quality to the original game.This isn’t helped by the “Motion Blur” setting. Usually I am a fan of such an option, but I know many people love it or hate it. Sadly in RE4 it’s a very low quality blur, almost giving the impression of a lower frame rate. Luckily this option is completely optional, as Resident Evil 4 does a good job of allowing users to change texture quality, shadows, anti aliasing etc.A comparison between the “HD” and “SD” textures can be found  [HERE] [www.capcom-unity.com]It is far from a “complete visual overhaul” – especially when compared to games such as Final Fantasy X | X-2 HD Remaster, which not only reworked textures, they improved pre-rendered backgrounds, completely replaced low poly LOD meshes with higher polygon versions and even went the extra mile to completely re-arrange the old MIDI tracks with a full orchestral sound track.On to the “Native keyboard and mouse support” - Sadly this is where things get more disappointing. Although Capcom have added the ability to turn mouse acceleration on or off, it’s rather moot as the mouse aiming feels like it’s just emulating  XINPUT commands, causing floaty, clunky aiming that feels far from “native.”The most irritating issue regarding controls is that mouse support is completely absent from menu screens, such as the inventory management. Instead, you must use WASD to move the cursor around the grid based attaché case, press E to select it, Page Up and Page Down to rotate and E again to place back down. This is vastly disappointing, I would have expected to simply have a drag and drop system where I can freely move objects with the mouse.The game is fully compatible with an Xbox 360 controller, so at least that’s an option if the mouse issues are too much, and unlike the original PC port – This version correctly displays newly textured prompts to correspond with using a controller. No more “Press Button 8 to dodge”.I must admit, however, even on controller, the control-scheme has not aged well. Like most people, I’ve been spoiled by modern systems, fluid 360-degree motion and 3D camera systems as opposed to Resident Evil 4′s tank controls. I don’t remember the original being so clunky but I’m quite certain that’s due to the system being fairly good for it’s time back then. I wouldn’t class this as a negative, however. It uses the same controls as the original, and if I enjoyed it so much back then I’m sure I just need to get back to grips with an older style of play.Complaints aside, running Resident Evil 4 at native 1080p at 60fps is a great thing. I cannot imagine myself going back to the 30fps version, and I would go as far as saying, despite its flaws, this is the definitive version of Resident Evil 4. Especially when compared to the original PC port.			"

												Resident Evil 4, having played the original Gamecube version back in 2005 it's safe to say that this version of the game is a better updated version of Resident Evil 4. This is the first time that Resident Evil 4 is running at 60 fps, which is a nice change compared to the console 30 fps cap. Overall, awesome game if you love Resident Evil 4 and there are a couple of set backs along the way. First, the default controls are very odd and second when your aiming your gun at an enemy Leon's parkinsion's grip of the guns are more noticable than I remember. Great game, I highly recommend this game especially if you haven't played Resident Evil 4 before.			"

												One of the best games of all time, hands down, no questions asked. If you find this game for less than 10 bucks then there's no reason you shouldn't buy it. Hell, if you don't own it, just buy it, it's that good. Seriously, I've played through this game 20+ times and I'll still come back to it in the future for another run through of this action packed, spine-chiliing, pickle-tickling, Los Illuminados-slaying,♥♥♥♥♥♥throbbing, ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece of a videogame. Games like this are the reason why God put us on this planet; to quote the Lord himself on the subject: Genesis 1:28 ""God blessed them and said to them 'be fruitful and make Resident Evil 4' "" and so man created Resident Evil 4, the most ♥♥♥♥ing cash money game of all time. This game holds a special place in my heart, just as it should in your heart as well. So do yourself a favour and buy this game, you won't be disapointed.			"

												Clearly one of the best PS2 games ever released, and we got the chance to play it in PC.. Yes, the controller is a bit different and takes time to get used to, but the game experience is equally satisfying. A huge game with massive replay value, 3 different difficulties, 3 side missions, unlockable weapons and costumes. One of my all time favorite games and a classic in PS2 material.			"

												I had this game for the GameCube. This game is a freakin legend in the gaming community for a good reason... But the HD edition on the PC has its problems. I want to be clear that this might be an isolated incident and for you to try anyways. I could not progress further than the first el gigante boss fight (not a spoiler he has zero story importance aside from 'that's one big man baby!') the game would crash every single time he hit me and if he grabbed me the game would glitch out and would not progress or do anything, just sit there awkwardly while el gigante shook me around like a dog toy for all eternity. Cutscenes went out of sync with their audio and the game has forced frame rate caps. Who does that?! Seriously capcapom? Instead get this on the wii, or a console where hardware won't play a part in this because like I said I think this might be an isolated incident.			"

												Resident Evil 4 is one of my favorite games of all time, and the PC controls make a good game better. Playing with a mouse is a great improvement over a thumbstick. The QTEs (Quick Time Events) have been made easier. In previous versions, the QTEs would involve a random set of buttons each time you faced a QTE event. This meant that, if you missed one input while running from a boulder and were then curshed by the boulder, you would have no idea what buttons you would need upon respawn to succeed, and might die agian to the same QTE. For RE4 on Steam, however, the QTEs have been adjusted to be the same for each singular instance. There is no way to eliminate the QTEs from the game, however.The RE4 options menu is surprisngly basic, but if you have a low-end machine you should be able to manage 30fps with ""classic"" textures (the same way the game ran on the Gamecube).Gameplay:

												As a huge fan of this game on other platforms, I was really disappointed by how badly this was ported over.

												“Insect lives don’t compare to human lives!”OK, first thing to get out of the way is the fact that the dialogue is atrociously camp and the characters are mere caricatures (not to mention oddly sexist, especially for 2005) – as if the whole thing was written by a teenage boy – but, like Star Wars’ wilful ignorance of science, politics, or military ranks, these things have become a hallmark of the series, and it wouldn’t feel like Resident Evil without them.Taking that into account, I really loved this game.  It gets everything right that, oddly, the more recent game, The Evil Within, by the same designer gets wrong.  The two games have plenty in common, but RE4 gets the balance right every time where TEW fails to do so.  They both have wonky controls, but they are just responsive enough in RE4 so that it doesn’t feel like the game is actively fighting you.  They both have challenging boss fights, but where in TEW you have to use the One Solution and can be one-shotted by almost every boss the moment you make a mistake, in RE4 you have options -- and because a boss has to hit you a few times to kill you, you can actually learn from your mistakes, backing off a bit to heal and/or switch weapons.  I find it much more dramatic to figure out how to defeat an enemy while fighting it than sitting on the load screen (or tabbing out to the internet) because my character was killed instantly for putting one foot in the wrong place.A related area where RE4 shines is its autosave points.  Unlike TEW, where defeat often meant having to replay whole sections of the game just to get back to the fiendishly difficult point, RE4 saves before every boss fight, as well as at other key points.  Not to mention the manual save points, which are spread out just enough to make you value them.  The pacing is also excellent, alternating betwen tense, life-threatening situations and calmer moments when you have a chance to explore the area.There is plenty of content in this game, ranging over a variety of settings.  Several times when I thought it was about to end, I was pleasantly surprised to find there was another chapter to follow – yet it never wears out its welcome.  This is partly to do with an expertly-designed progression of power.  The chances to improve Leon’s abilities and weapons are doled out at just the right pace, not giving you too much at once and forcing you to make choices, but not being miserly about it either.  Enemy difficulty ramps up at an appropriate pace as well, and although there were a few instances where it seemed to be unfairly challenging, after succeeding on a second attempt it all felt right – I never had that “how was I supposed to know to do that?” feeling.I could mention some minor niggles, like there being no hint anywhere that you have to aim to reload your weapon (why??), the inexplicable (though appreciated) dropping of ammo by foes with no firearms, or the fact that their houses are full of it, or the strange, persistent presence of a mysterious arms dealer who seems to be ignorant of all that’s going on around him (and who has plenty of weapons but not a single bullet for sale) – but those don’t hinder the gameplay at all.  My strongest complaint about the game is probably Leon’s ridiculous hairstyle, but if that makes it to the top of a problem list, you know the game itself has to be really good.The add-on missions that are unlocked when you first complete the game don't quite measure up to the main story: there's hardly any power progression and very little to buy with collected treasures, and there are one or two times where the game forces the character to take actions that make no sense, but none of that takes away from the main game.RECOMMENDATION: if you use kb & mouse and remap the keys to anything other than the default, I strongly recommend you edit the ini file (http://steamcommunity.com/app/254700/discussions/0/627456486960742247/) to change the QTE keys to something more convenient.  I use the arrow keys for movement, and I was able to change KEY_1 and KEY_2 to Left and Right so I didn’t even have to move my left hand.			"

												Now before you all start to send me Hate Mail for leaving this as a Thumbs Down I should State that I have Spent Countless Hours on the GameCube and the Wii Versions of this - and I still do.  The reason I bougt this is because I am away from Home for Long periods of time and I can't take all that Equipment With me so I bought this for my Gamig Laptop.However - (and I know this won't apply to everyone) What the Hell have they done to the Framerate here?!  Honestly within Seconds this Game gives me the worsed case of Motion Sicknes I have ever Expierienced.  And I am not alone in this.  Maybe it's the awful Controls or a Combination of Both but For me this is quite literally Unplayable.   Alan Wake was bad but this is so much worse.This is not a Computer Moniter Issue either as I also plug this into the same Large Screen as the Wii which does not bother me at all, however I get the same Intense (almost Instant) motion Sickness that i don't get with the Wii or GameCube.  I'm genuinely interested ti know What the heck has happened here?Plese be aware of this before you buy.			"

												i really wanted to like this game but the controls just don't quite cut it.  using A and D to turn feels very un-intuitive, and for my keyboard, i can't even turn right while running (shift+W+D doesn't register as a command or something).  plays fine on a controller except for the fact that you can't change the stick sensitivity.  i know it just came out, but it's kind of disappointing that they took the time to add in HD textures and improve the frame rate (both things that didn't have much bearing on the game experience in the first place) but not update the controls to be more in tune with other PC games.  i don't doubt that this can be fixed in a future patch or update, but for the time being this is not a great port of the game.  :(			"

Whenever I run, it feels like I'm walking. Whever I walk, it feels like I barely move. It rarely has a point where it actually feels like it is not lagging.

IF your playing with contoller (which is best) i suggest you stick to it but no matter, this game will betray you with slow rotation. If you go with keyboard the game will fail you with handling.whatever you go for your game will betray you when you you reach level 4-3 when you jump out the mines and your player refuses to respond to either and thus leaves you to die...FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER...that is unless you find a cheat to skip the level.... good luck.

												Having owned this game on every console it was available on, watching the visuals get progressively better, I decided to see how much Capcom could improve from the HD versions on the PS3 & 360 on my new System. First of all I can run it at maximum settings on my temporary GTX 760, so at a guess even lower end systems should be able to run it no problem. Obviously this is a game that was made for older platforms but with the new high quality textures & the smoother 60fps it just looks absolutely amazing. If you are a massive of Resident Evil 4 like me & have been wanting a proper PC version of the game, this is definitely for you!10/10			"

												I love the game a ton, and have owned it on Android, GameCube, PS2, Wii, and the previous PC release by SourceNext in one area of the world and Ubisoft in another. The game falsely advertised itself as ""ULTIMATE HD EDITION"" when it came out, though the title seems to have changed since only 1/10 of the game's textures were actually remade to be ""HD"" (though they weren't really HD, just not as SD).ProsUp to 4K resolutionHas 60fps supportMouse aim, unlike the SourceNext/Ubisoft portArguably the best RE to dateCons60fps ties the game speed to framerateTextures are NOT by ANY means HDAnti-Aliasing kills performanceCrappy controls in menus and inventoryCapcom was lazyPoorly optimised; requires a medium-high end CPU to maintain 60fpsCapcom was extremely lazy to the point that two modders took the ""HD"" aspect of the game that was supposed to be the selling point for this release into their own hands. Not only that, but people have reported, since release, that their systems are unable to handle this game somehow, even with the 30fps lock on. It's kind of ridiculous when a 780Ti and i7 4790K can't handle the game, but a Pentium G3258 and a Radeon 5570 can. Overall, the game, while being good itself, is not really worth getting.Also, I don't condone getting any of Capcom's games actually, since recently with their RE5 Gold Edition release, they broke the game on various degrees and removed features, and hadn't given a discount or free DLC to those who already owned the game before its special release. Capcom, among other developers, are lazy, and need to be called out on these practices.			"

												Very poorly optimized.  I am running Windows 7, 8 GB of DD3, Intel Core Duo at 3.24 Ghz, an Nvdia GeForce with 1.72 Ghz clock and 2 GB of DD5 and I still can't get a solid 30 fps with the resolution at 800x600 and all the settings turned down.  This game should run on anything with a screen.  Unacceptable.			"

												Don't know if it's a problem with me or the game itself, but no matter how low the resolution or the video settings, this game just will not run right. I meet all the minimums but the audio is still horrificly off. Stuttering, lagging, missings sounds entirely. It runs fine in every other aspect but having the audio so choppy has rendered this version of the game unplayable for me. Waste of money			"

												The cutscenes don't work correctly. The animations and sounds are completley off. The Gameplay is sluggish. The movement does not feel right. This game has some serious issues. Very Dissappointed. I dunno how steam could release this . It's not even playable. My pc is fine. I run RE6 RE revelations on high settings. For some reason.... I can't even run RE4 old azz game on 30 fps low settings. SAVE YOUR MONEY!			"

												Resident Evil 4 was originally launched over a decade ago in 2005, it's still mostly good as new and definitely worth playing.Pros:+ Graphics look almost modern+ Large variety of interesting weapons+ Very intelligent AI+ Fantastic boss battles+ Amazing atmosphere+ Detailed and interesting environments+ Excellent soundtrack+ Lengthy singleplayer (took me 15 hours)+ Ridiculous amounts of extra content+ Very replayableCons:- Controls are very awkward and take time getting used to- ""HD textures"" included in Steam edition are total trash, disable them in the options- Enabling 60fps causes several problems involving enemy AI and quicktime events			"

												Resident Evil 4 is by far the best game of the franchise and I played it tons of hours on my ps2 years ago, yet I can't recommend this game to anyone playing with a keyboard and mouse. Taking up aim to shoot someone or something is a very very slow process where you really have to stay calm and try to give your best to continue the game. Furthermore the movement and ingame progress is ridiculously slow.Playing this masterpiece with a 360 controller would solve the problems, yet who want's to play with a controller after there was a promised new pc port. One of those games just slowly dying due to a lack of proper support and maintenance.			"

												Resident Evil 4 returns after 9-10 years of it being almost forgotten! Thank goodness capcom thought of remaking and reviving the old, loved games as their next move to have time to create a GREAT sequel that brings back the traditional, and classic resident evil style of play. This is an amazing game, and for 20 bucks? It's perfect... yeah sure not all the game is redefined with next-gen graphics but some of the textures are improved with HD-styles... and as I said; we used to get this game for what? 40-60 bucks back in its old days? Now, with atleast a little bit of improvement and for 20 bucks?That's what I call, a bargain!Thank you Capcom for bringing this back...To capcom:I also recommend to you guys that you bring back the classic resident evils... (Resident evil 1, 2 and 3, and also Code Veronica and Code Veronica X) with next-gen graphics... you can also add to the story in an APPROPRIATE way but NOT TAKE AWAY ANYTHING from the old days. If you do this, you will regain your loyalty from your fans that you lost after abandoning them... including myself (Bringing re4 back made me appreciate u lads again :D)I hope you like this review, and I highly suggest capcom does what I said to them, and what the rest of the community says, as well as me suggesting you guys (the dudes reading this) to buy this game! :D			"

												The controls work so differently in comparison to any other 3rd person shooter PC game. It just hurts my brain trying to get used to it. Leon goes to save the daugther of the president an cannot even move sideways? He must stand still to use the knife?Please CAPCOM, if someone is reading the forums, implement the following features:  Set [A] and [D] to strafe. Make the mouse turn the player.I already paid for the game as I have read the forums finding out that this way of controlling is supposed to give the unique resident evil experience. For me it feels like a terrible console port.They got the controls in Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6 on PC right, why not here?The next time I am considering getting a new resident evil, the first thing I do is to search for the following on the Internet: ""resident evil bad controls"" ... Expensive lesson to learn.			"

												TL;DR - You wont regret buying it 10/10Resident Evil 4 is a Classic. One of the best Resident Evil's in the series that was released. Its always fun to go back to this game and replay it over and over. It really never gets boring. As soon as this got released i played for a good 12 hours. If you are new to the resident evil series, you'll love this one. Resident Evil 1,2 and 3 was around horror and not exactly action, and 5 and 6 were based mostly on action, and 4 is inbetween horror and action, giving a brilliant combo. You mainly have to try to conserve your ammo (depending on your difficulty) and survive. Giving it a nice survival aspect. Secret treasures and areas that reward you if you keep an eye out and the game never lets you down when you go the wrong way, instead, you get rewarded with other items, such as herbs (which can heal you, increase your maximum health depending on the herb), ammunition etc. etc. I've played this game on and off ever since its release, and its still fun to this day. Good storyline, Good Fun. 10/10.			"

												I just wanna put it out there that I am apparently the only person in the world who doesn't dislike the port but just plain dislikes the game. I don't think there's one negative review that doesn't say ""I just wanna start by saying I loved this game on (insert sixth generation console here)"". I'm not really sure what I dislike about this game, I just know I don't like any of it, as much as I wanted to.Headshots just aren't a thing in this unless their heads happen to explode, effectively making the pistol entirely useless, for a good while at least. It turns out kicking them with Leons stronger-than-bullets roundhouse is the most effective way of killing them. I'm aware that they're not technically zombies, they're just extremely hard headed Spaniards but still! It seems the only good zombie game out there that isn't just trying to be a barrel of laughs for the whole family is The Last Of Us (again, I know they're not zaaahmbies!) The controls are abysmal in pretty much the same way all of these old games are. You can't aim and move at the same time and even when you do aim it's like Leon has Parkinsons and god help you if someone throws a grenade at you (or a stick of dynamite 'cos you're in a farming village and apparently farmers always need to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up), moving out of the way of one of those suckers in a tight space is like trying to dodge a fart on an escalator and even if you do manage to turn around it seems to take ten minutes before you can start moving in that direction. Oh and the camera, don't get me started, it's just awful. I played with a controller by the way, any moron who plays a game that was designed for a console with a keyboard and mouse and then complains that they don't work as well as they think they should shouldn't be allowed outside without adult supervision and a high-vis helmet.I think overall it just suffers from Capcoms trademark crappiness, the only games of theirs I like are the first two Onimusha games. For some reason every game has the same style, where every main character has a pretty boy haircut and is almost completely void of a personality and comes alongside a ridiculous plot.I suppose I don't like it mostly becuase I didn't play it when it came out like everyone else so I have no rose-tinted specs to view this through. That or I'm just venting my anger 'cos I haven't slept and I found out my wife's cheating on me... I lied, I don't have a wife... maybe that's why I'm venting. Point being, I wouldn't recommend buying this game if you've never played it before (which would make you an anomaly it seems). I would suggest trying out someone else's copy as a demo before you make any decisions, otherwise just don't buy it. Thankfully that's what I did, I damn near bought this a while back.			"

												It is good game, too bad my PC is too slow to run it or maybe it is to epic for my PC to handle. I have many versions of this game, 1 (2 disc set) on Gamecube, 1 on Wii , and 1 on playstaion 2. My rating will have to be 7/10In this game you play as Leanardo Dicarpo on mission to rescue the president's daughter (sorry wrong guy). (correct guy this time)In this game you play as Leon Scott Kennedy on a mission to rescue the president's daughter.			"
