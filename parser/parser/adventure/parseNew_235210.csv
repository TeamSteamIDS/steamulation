												Definitely does the name justice and worth every cent thus far.Graphically it's a 2.5d game (obviously). But the effort gone into all the lighting effects really shows and adds a lot to the detail level imo. Love the scarf being used as a dynamic light source. Didn't skip a beat fps wise and overall it's just a joy to play. The entire world is lovely, as is the accompanying soundtrack. Supports 1440p+ and 120hz+ setups which I was impressed with given capcoms history.Game contains one giant world but it has reasonably intelligent level design, backtracking to unlock new areas with moves that were not accessible before and such. Guessing at the length it should last  around 6-10hrs. Maybe more if into collectables and higher difficulty modes. Tight controls with a decent combo system that should keep expanding for a while. If you're a fan of Strider or metroidvania styled games in general, at this pricepoint it's a must buy imo. Immersive and enjoyable experience so far that fans should not be dissapointed with. Thanks for being faithful Double Helix. :)			"

												I don't often write reviews but this game is jaw dropping amazing and as a gamer I had to do my part to encourage other gamers to purchase this masterpiece.  The game is fluid and fast.  The game plays like the Marvel vs Capcom series but with less emphasis on combos and a barrage of enemies to mutilate.  It is the type of game that makes you wonder why it took so long to come out.  It plays like Ninja Gaiden but with every game element taken to it's limit.  You can climb ANYWHERE, secrets are EVERYWHERE, and robotic thugs aim to punish you.  Enemies come in both the cloned and overly personalized varieties.  The bright flash of colors and the effects are as intense as a psychodelic experience at times.  It feel's like a playable anime and it never givse you a moment to rest those button mashing fingers.  Intense and hardcore as they get.  Buy this now, you will not regret it, and thank you capcom for this wonderful experience!			"

												Strider is a reinterpretation of Capcom’s 1989 arcade platformer classic of the same name. Reboots are always tricky, particularly reboots of a certain age. How much should a developer pander to the existing fanbase? And how should they entertain newcomers? Off the back of the largely successful Killer Instinct reimagining in 2013 for Xbox One, developer Double Helix Games had its work cut out for it when making 2014’s Strider.It’s not entirely clear where game developers drew their inspiration from in the 1980s. Looking back at Capcom’s original Strider, it’s all somewhat reminiscent of a scene from Aldous Huxley’s darkly satiric A Brave New World, with its looming dictator state, pseudo futuristic flying machines, and lone protagonist forced into rebellion. Don’t get me wrong, it was great fun, but like many of its 80s peers - Space Harrier and Altered Beast, prime examples - it was also a bit mad: level progression was jarring, and it was never really clear what was actually going on. What’s clear now is that 2014’s reimagining of Strider adds a little more cohesion to the old story, whilst compromising very little of the good stuff. With what appears to be a less than subtle point to prove, the new Strider hits the ground running, all guns blazing, firing on all cylinders, and whatever other relevant speed/capacity related cliche you can think of. It’s fast yet at the same time entirely cool, striking an almost perfect balance for the most part. Immediately following a familiar hand glider descent into Grandmaster Meio’s robot-policed Socialist republic Kazakh City, frontman Strider Hiryu wastes no time in relaying his reasons to player and enemy alike: he’s a cyber ninja and he’s here to kill. A flash of his Cypher sword immediately leaves a pair of automaton foes sprawled out on the concourse, but before their short-circuiting innards hit the floor, our hero has cartwheeled onto the next duo, executing the same lightening speed maneuver to devastating effect. And so Strider sets the pace which it manages to maintain almost from start to finish, doing so whilst retaining the vigor and swagger and red scarf-flailing of the protagonist’s quarter of a century-old predecessor. Best of all - it looks and feels brilliant. Much similar to his older brother, Strider Hyru is capable of such enemy trouncing acrobatics in concert with a wide range of skills. The only difference this time round is that the ninja’s skill-set must be learned, each individual skill in turn, via the game’s freshly imposed Metroidvania structure; or “gear-gating,” a term which seems to be becoming increasingly popular. At first, Strider’s arsenal is limited, but this is matched by lesser-skilled baddies - largely generic foot soldiers in the opening stages - whereupon enjoying the velocity of the kill is more important than strategy, something which actually never gets old. Health orbs appear in abundance early on too, diminishing only slightly as the game progresses, but with a slew of evenly-spaced checkpoints throughout, back-tracking never really becomes an issue.Although reluctant to overuse the slightly lazy term ‘Metroidvania’ - Strider is a bloody good one. By adopting such a mechanic, not only can powerups like sword-charging be learned - used to cut through shield-bearing foes - but classic stunts such as Hyru’s signature double jump can also be accrued, adding not only a clever layer of depth to the game, but also a certain level of order - something distinctly lacking in the original. As expected in gear-gating games of this nature, each respective boss battle requires deft use of the previously learned skill - my favourites including the ability to deflect bullets ala Metal Gear Solid’s Grey Fox, and manipulating time portals in order to unlock otherwise inaccessible areas - with completion often unlocking the next in turn. This works well on the whole, however there are the odd occasions where confusing layouts, regardless of the HUD map and pointer icon’s input, lead to lengthy misadventures which terminate at superfluous collector’s items, as opposed to the ‘right way’ - ie the next boss. For a game that relies on - and largely operates in - its fast-action, high-octane sequences, this proves incredibly tedious, placing a needless obstacle between the player and what the game does best. Another issue with Strider’s setting is its lack of variety. Although integral to the original, Kazakh City wasn’t the game's lone location, as an Amazonian-style jungle and Arctic-inspired snow land also featured. These zones were initially included in early screenshots of the 2014 edition, however were dropped from its final iteration. This leaves certain areas feeling slightly monotonous - particularly in the latter third of the six hour or so quest- only noticeably switching things up upon entering Meio’s headquarters towards the game’s end. This, however, is best portrayed here by a gravity switching sequence, which will more than satisfy those in search of nostalgia. But what Strider lacks in landscape diversity, it makes up for with deft use of camera angles. Although fixed throughout, the way in which the game switches from close to long range with each scene serves to govern the pace of each battle. With interchangeable camerawork akin to the Oddworld series, bouts viewed from distance tend to be drawn-out, planned affairs, wherein the player is afforded the time to pick and choose which enemies to engage with, traversing walls and ceilings with the strider’s automatically activated grapple hooks; whereas closeups regularly become a mash of sweaty, quick-fire button-bashing until everything on screen has stopped moving. Boss battled are designed to steal center stage, and often do. Each showdown has a sequence which must be understood and then adhered to and followed in order to match each antagonist. That said, some foes can be outdone by simply seizing space and battering the attack button, racing your health bar against theirs. More often than not, following the correct process works best but can at times becomes frustrating, as the difficulty of each boss is less than predictable. How much of a problem this actually is depends on the player, however I saw this balance of challenge and luck more of an homage to the difficulty of the coin-operated games of yore, of which Strider hails from. Strider is unapologetic in its approach: it’s a Metroidvania that thrives on speed, slashing, and general carnage. It manages all four very well. Story-lite it may be, but it never tries to be otherwise, and a host of bosses and enemies such as mechanical crabs, robotic gorillas, and snaking mechanised Chinese dragons, not to mention an army of drones and Strider-sized soldiers all keep the entertainment flowing. Of course the aforementioned cyber mammals, reptiles and arthropods will likely resonate with existing fans; yet the ferocity of these battles will also appeal to newcomers. And that’s why this Strider works as a ‘remake’ - it clearly is a new game, built from the ground up, but is also laced with sentimentality.Bear in mind the original Strider was introduced as a coin-op arcade game, predating the 90s and a fair whack of the modern market, therefore capturing a new audience is something Double Helix has clearly also set out to do. Match this with the Californian outfit’s reimagining of Killer Instinct last year, and it would appear they know what they’re doing when reinterpreting the classics. By adopting a Metroidvania-guise here, rather, gear-gating, Double Helix shows that it can in fact teach an old dog new tricks.			"

												Upon its release, Strider promised gameplay faithful to the original series and attacks as responsive as your button presses. Poor marketing if you ask me. They leave out the magic of the Charge Strike Meter, which fills up every time you hit an enemy without getting hit yourself. Charge Mode is best described as ""Fry with 100 cups of coffee"" mode and for my money, blows away its Sleeping Dogs equivalent in the dust. It transforms the gameplay entirely, turning your Strider from a vulnerable hoppy-avoidy ninja who has to manage his button presses into the ultimate human chainsaw able to finish off monstrous killer robots before they can fire off their next shot. You lose all of that power the moment you get hit, so there's actual tension in those hellish games of chicken.It might seem wrong to enjoy a Strider game on the strength of playing a death-crazed berzerker rather than a nimble evasive ninja, but it's fun in its own right and that's what counts; right? Dare I call it an intelligent button-masher? Because you work to enter Charge Mode, you work to stay in Charge Mode and you work to take advantage of the 5 seconds of Charge Mode, I say yes. That's right: Strider is worth your money for the 5 seconds of Charge Mode it provides. The exploration aspect? You live in a bleak cacotopia where every enemy is a one dimensional evil baddy. Finding stuff is a chore, not a reward. The attacks most associated with Strider, to wit the Slide and the Down Strike, feel tacked on by the necessity of this being a Strider franchise. In practice, these attacks are mostly used for area unlocking rather than combat. I might've bought this game on the strength of its franchise but now I've discovered a much greater, far more exciting game that would exist outside of it...Other weapon mechanics are a mixed bag.Your Kunai and Options are powered by an energy bar which refills over time, encouraging you to use your specials at any time without taking undue importance from your Cypher attacks. Your Cypher Upgrades on the other hand seem oddly mismanaged. Your first upgrade is the Reflect Cypher and it's the coolest by far, turning you into some sort of Jedi and allowing you to reflect bolts with your sword if you time it just right, opening up synergy with the Charge Mode mechanic for its slowdown effect. Too bad enemies stop using reflectable bolts midway through the game. The second upgrade is the Burst Cypher and completely trivializes all other upgrades by simply making your enemy explode. It is, in fact, the best upgrade. Third upgrade is the Ultra-Cold Cypher, for turning enemies into ice platforms and better explore the game whle the fourth upgrade fires ranged boomerangs from your sword, somewhat defeating the whole ""you have a sword, your enemies have guns"" motif inherent to ninja-related games. It's the last upgrade though, and as such feels enough like an end-game mechanic that you forgive it for being dead simple.Although not as exciting as the combat, the platforming can be enjoyable on its own thanks to the Plasma Catapult, your 8-way short-ranged teleport dash device. The challenge comes from planning your trajectory, working the flexible nature of your jumps along with the linear nature of the Plasma Catapult to form elaborate mid-air travel paths. The Plasma Catapult also gains from the Cypher Upgrades to form some cool but essentially useless gimmicks. For example, the Magnetic Plasma Catapult turns the targets you pass through into living magnets for enemy fire! Too bad it's tied to the ranged Magnetic Upgrade, making it more convenient to just shoot them from a distance. In fact, every combat gimmick tied to the Plasma Catapult is nullified by the fact that the Plasma Catapult phases through your enemies, bypassing the very notion of combat!On the topic of Challenge Mode, one important notice for the developers: you need a way to show the player his top score and rank in a stage BEFORE they clicks the mission, so the player knows which stage they aced and which stage still needs work. Otherwise, since Story Mode is rather short and offers rather little replay options, alternative modes of play become greatly appreciated. Thankfully, Challenge Mode missions are built around the best aspects of the game: races across the city, and combat!I gripe, but I had fun. The developers, Double Helix Games, have thrown a great deal of ideas at the wall and many of them stuck. You want a sequel and you want an editor, someone who will focus the game on the more thoughtful mechanics and axe all the overpowered♥♥♥♥♥♥ No seriously, the first Option you unlock, the bird, turns each and every boss fight into easy mode. EVEN THE END BOSS FINAL FORM!REVIEW EDITED FOR LENGTH.			"

												This is how you do reboots. Strider Hiryu returns, along with his arsenal of animal friends (now plasma entities as opposed to robots) and his trusty sword. Everything from previous Strider games can be found here, though this game feels alot more fleshed out in comparison to the arcade titles.  Hiryu's moveset's been given an upgrade, with some of his Marvel vs Capcom moves making an appearance. His heavy launcher from UMVC3 is here, for instance.  Enemies can be juggled, certain projectiles can be parried and alot of the ""outside the box"" stuff from modern action games are also implemented. I really appreciated being able to pull off some combos utilizing the launcher attack and the directional light attacks in the air. Along with special moves such as a ground slam ability you obtain, there's some depth to the combat system. Strider's an assassin, he's not a tank. As the player, you'll be dodging attacks and avoiding bullets as opposed to blocking them. Hiryu's really mobile, so it's no problem. The lack of a block button might be off putting to those more comfortable with modern games, but I really liked figuring out patterns and dodging gunfire.Boss battles are frequent and all of them feel satisfying to defeat. The only real issue I found with this game is that the PC port does not seem to be optimized pretty well. I have a decent machine and was experiencing some slow down in certain areas, and constant screen tearing. Especailly during cinematics. I would definitely give this a shot if you are a fan of Strider's previous games or just action platformers in general. It's a fantastic reboot, which often times feels like that'd be an oxymoron, but it works very well in Strider's case.  "

												Strider stands as a reboot to an old Arcade series by the same name. The game stars Hiryu, the last remaining Strider to be sent on a suicide mission that involves taking down Grandmaster Meio, the iron fisted ruler of Kazakh City and the Earth and avenging the fallen Striders.The game's mechanics are pretty simple, like an old school title should. It's structured very similarly to some older games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Super Metroid and the such as it has a lot of backtracking as well as you gain new powers to unlock new doors and the such - which may lead to new powers, health upgrades, energy upgrades, kunai upgrades, etc. There's lots to find in the game.It's a standard Action Platformer, Strider can jump and he can cling to walls to get to higher places. It's a very vertical oriented game and you will need to explore literally every nook and cranny if you want to find every collectible. As you gain new powers, such as the Double Jump, or the Blast Cannon later on in the game, you gain more mobility and ways to go about exploring. *~Some stages have Two planes, meaning it's a secondary map of the same stage that counts as one stage. You need a Power for it, which you get early on in the game. *~There's also a way to move about each stage quicker when later on in the game you get the Panther Upgrade. These are called ""Panther Runs"" and they serve as key hubs in a stage, you essentially transport from one to another.*~ The Kunai (which is an upgrade btw - you may see it on a Loading Screen tip but cannot use them until you obtain them later on), is used to open doors aswell. You target a door's recepticle (not on the door itself), the door unlocks and re locks after a certain time passes, so you have to be quick on these aswell.Some stages, like the ""Black Market"" stage, have all sorts of traps and environmental hazards that serve as puzzles as their own. Taking damage from some of these traps can issue a ""Reset"" where Strider teleports back to the nearest safe zone or they can cause knockback. In other instances, hazards, such as Acid or Lava, deal constant damage as you stand on them.*Note - There is NO Fast Travel options for those out there that need clarification on this. If you take your time out to explore, just like in those titles mentioned before, you HAVE to travel back by yourself through the stage. Also, I'm not pointing out every way you have to open doors, that's part of the challenge. Combat is pretty straightforward aswell, with a few twists. At the beginning, you'll have your basic Cypher (Identifiable by the colour scarf Strider has) which doesn't do anything right then and there. Strider will attack as fast as you press the button too   which can help deal additional damage to bosses and enemies as well as the standard slash attack being omnidirectional. Wherever you point the analog stick is where Strider will strike. Ex- If you hold top right, Strider will attack top right. You also get a slide, which can help avoid enemy attacks and help you set up moves aswell. Upgrades come in many different flavours. Your standard Cypher (Red Scarf - Also known later on as Reflective Cypher) gains the ability to deflect projectiles back at enemies and you also get a Charge attack very early on in the game which is needed to deal additional damage and break enemy shields. Cyphers also affect Kunais and Blast Cannon - but these upgrades need to be found separately. There are a total of 4 different Cyphers you'll be getting in the game additional to your standard one:*Reflective Cypher (Red Scarf) - Deals normal damage, adds the ability do deflect enemy projectiles. No special Kunai Upgrades, No Special Blast Cannon Upgrades.*Freeze Cypher (Blue Scarf) - Deals Normal damage, adds the ability to freeze enemies in place (enemies can be used as platforms). Kunai will freeze enemies on contact. Blast Cannon adds a wave where Strider is that will freeze enemies in place as you fly past them.*Fire Cypher (Orange Scarf) - Deals the most damage, adds the ability to damage enemies over time. Kunai will attach and explode over time on enemies or ground. Blast Cannon will damage and burn enemies.*Magnetic Cypher (Purple Scarf) - Turns Swipes into Boomerang (Cannot Mash button to attack faster - Have a max of 2 hits then must wait until blade comes back to you). Kunai bounces off surfaces, Blast Cannon deals additional damage.Apart from these, obviously - Strider has 3 additional moves that expend energy, like the Kunais. Option-A (Eagle) appears above Strider and does a sweeping motion according from where it was summoned and hits for high damage, you'll be using this one a lot on bosses as it deals the most damage. Option-B (Panther) appears next to Strider, and moves forward until it hits a wall, then he runs the opposite direction (like a turtle shell in the Super Mario Bros games) and Option-C (Bots) summons two robots that appear around Strider that shoot spheres as you attack adding additional damage to your basic swipes. Enemy types, sadly where the game faulters, is not very varied. You have your basic grunts with different weapon types - one can carry a Sniper Shot that if it hits you can cause knockback, another can have a rifle, shotguns, RPG's or a Machine Gun (deals most damage but won't see much of it during the game). Some grunts can carry shields - the non color shield can be destroyed by Option-A, Option-B or a Charged Swipe, likewise a Blue shield can only be destroyed by Freeze Cypher moves, Orange shields by Fire Cypher and Purple Shields by Magnet Cypher. The color shield enemy grunts only appear as you obtain the upgrades and then later on in the game, but they aren't really adding any challenge, more adding to the nuisance of having to switch Cyphers - like the Magnet Cypher, which was nigh useless to me outside of opening doors with it. One thing that annoyed me was how they only recolor the grunts and drop em on different stages, it felt a bit lazy. Another enemy type, are flying bots that use about the same weapons grunt use and are really annoying, especially those that can cause knockback with rockets or heavy fire. Some bots later on, can actually charge at you and cause knockback. Then there are the larger enemies, like the Heavy Trooper (Yellow and Red) that have an arm that extends to where you are if they are facing you, or have napalm shots that home on where you were standing, you can deal with these guys easy though - the enemy that REALLY annoyed me was the Brainwalker, most of his attacks can cause knockback, he can charge at you and can push you off him if you're close enough - his shots can also home in on where you are.Bosses fare a LOT better though. They all have attack patterns very similar to bosses from games like MegaMan X and some are actually pretty tough like Solo. All in all though, bar a few annoyances, like Strider not being able to slash downwards directly if you're not jumping, the knockback state, the nearly useless Magnet Cypher and of course the game being short - this was definately one of my top games for 2014 and my top one for 2014 at the time of writing. It harkens back to older games like Symphony of the Night/Super Metroid/MegaMan X. Plays like one, feels like one and is a very welcome return for one of my old school favourite heroes very easily worth the asking price.Pros:+Amazing Combat System+Fantastic Stage and Level designs+Amazing Soundtrack+Game looks amazing+Great Particle and Weather effects+Bosses can be challenging and tons of fun+Tons to Explore and see+Diverse Upgrade System+Challenge Modes+Tons of CollectiblesCons-Limited Enemy Archetypes-Magnet Cypher is nigh useless in combat-Knockback state can be annoying-Game is short-Odd Checkpoint system "

												Damn good action platformer. Its very fast paced and exciting. Metroidvania-style progression through a city overworld. It might tax your computer a bit due to how constantly fast-paced the gameplay is. But if you can run it at full graphics, Strider is a beautiful 2D platformer as well. Its the best matroidvania game ive come across in quite some time, so if you like that kind of experience, you can't really go wrong with this (unless you really hate fast paced action). Worth it at full price, a must-have on sale.			"

Plot The plot is pretty simple, you're a ninja sent to kill the evil mastermind Meio who has dominated the world and for that you have to infiltrate into his city fortress, making your own path by destroying his minions and getting stronger in the process.Gameplay Menu interface: By pressing the map button you also can access the menu: The map can be zoomed in and out and it highlights power ups if you happen to get nearby enough. It also allows you to check maps of the areas you already explored. I had troubles checking other areas using the map. It seems the coordinates of the map stick to you so other areas map's are not centered and you will need to zoom out and then try to find it, there are also cases when you can't see the whole map if you are not completely zoomed out. Since the scrolling limit is reached before you get to the edges. Then you have an equipment tab which only purpose is to tell you the skills and power ups you unlocked so far.It kind of spoils the game since it tells you how many health, energy and kunai power ups are in the whole game and also the quantity of ""locked"" slots hints to the quantity swords and dashes you will get on the long run.And finally a suit tab, as you explore you will find different ninja suits which can used as soon as you get them. These suits have a small lore and are purely cosmetic (they're just palette swaps).Movement: It's quite fluid. The controls are very responsive and easy to use. Hiryu moves really fast and can jump into walls and ceilings, moving between them is relatively easy and this allows to explore the map to find hidden bonuses and power ups.Attack: Hiryu can run/jump/climb and attack with his sword at the same time giving him a lot of fluidity while attacking. You can also change the angles of your slashes. Depending on the situation, charge your attack and deal a high damage slash or deal quick slashes at the speed of your button mashing skills. You also unlock different elements for your sword, and kunais which allow you to reflect projectiles, burn, blow up, freeze and stun enemies and different kind of skills, adding lots of variety to your attacks.World: Each area is interesting in its own way, the first areas are quite basic, letting you learn the ropes and the limits of your starting abilities and each area increases the platforming difficulty taking into account the mobility skills you have acquired, forcing you to use them to its maximum potential. ex:  as you acquire double jump, the next area will ask you to jump an electric barriers which would have been impossible if you lacked that skill.This also happens when you unlock air dash.As you go further into the game, you unlock different types of ""swords"" and skills which, in a really metroid-esque style, allow you to gain access to previously inaccessible parts of the map or warp between areas. The map is indeed big so these fast travel devices really help at moving around the areas (which you will do a lot if you want to find all the hidden power up and extras which are almost always behind a door that can be unlocked with one of your newly acquired skill). One thing I noticed is that these ""warp"" devices, while they always take you to the same place, it is never previously told to you to where you're being sent. So if you don't memorize where each one will take you, you could end up wasting some time.  The enemy variety is quite lacking tho, it relies on upgraded version of the same enemies to up the difficulty as you keep advancing.Difficulty:You have infinite lives, there are a few checkpoints in each area, if you die. You get a fision mailed screen and then spawn in one of them so you can try again.The enemy variety is like this: mech-soldier, turret, big dudes and stationary cannons.  Mech-soldiers: They're pretty much the same. Their variety relies on what weapons they use (rifle,shotgun,machine guns, small rocket launchers or shields), most need from 1charged slash and/or 3 slashes to die since they grow a bit more durable as you progress. Flying turrets: They're pretty much the same as mech-soldiers, except airborne. Big dudes: Durable and slow, they telephone their attacks and can be easily kill-able by just jumping from their left to their right (they prioritize turning and they do it really slow). Stationary Cannons: Placed on walls or ceilings, they shoot at you rapidly, recharge and shoot at you again. Outside of bosses, the game is relatively easy even on hard difficulty. The charged attack has a wide range, deals high damage which allows you to take care of many enemies in a row and just needs approx. 2sec. to charge. Your normal attacks interrupts most enemies so as long as you keep hitting them they wont retaliate. As you get more power ups and new skills, you keep getting stronger to the point where most enemies won't really pose a threat to you. Platforming is also quite forgiving. Stepping on the acid/lava deals low damage as long as you jump out of it asap (which is pretty easy since the pools are shallow, they reach Hiryu's thighs at most) and anything that should one-shot you just does some chip damage and then returns you to the closest safe place you landed before so you can try again. So save for some exceptions, it's almost impossible to die from failed platforming,The bosses difficulty is harder compared to the normal enemies. They follow attack patterns as you lower their hp and enter ""phases"". this can be learned mid-fight, so as long as you learn it, the easiest ones should be doable on the first try.You're most feared enemies will be the popup messages by npcs which take space near the bottom of the screen, hiding enemies, traps and projectiles which you could have seen otherwise.Music:There really isn't any memorable soundtrack here, nor there are area specific music, so you will end up hearing around 5 different musics as you play.ExtrasThere are a few extras that are unlocked by discovering them in hidden parts of the world areas.  Artwork: Developers drawings and drafts Enemy data: Description of enemies and lore followed by their respectives 3D model. Challenges: Gauntlets and Speed runs. Clearing them would provide of an extra hour of gameplay but this doesn't really unlock anything additional.Conclusion:Strider is a decent game, It takes around 10hrs to clear the game if you backtrack to get all the power ups and most extras(I got around 78% of the extras when I cleared the game) I did backtrack on my own to get them earlier as soon as I unlocked a new skill, thinking I would never go back if I hadn't... The game had me go back anyways. So knowing this, one a new run it would take me 1 hour less or so to clear the game.The controls are nice and each new skills adds a lot to your mobility and damage but they don't really offer enough to provide the possibility of multiple playstyles until very late game. the platforming is quite challenging but also very forgiving in deadly areas via re-spawn. The difficulty is intermediate even in its highest difficulty with not much enemy variety. I would recommend it as long as you buy it on a 50%+sale.			"

												As a Strider fan, this game was a disappointment.Compared to other ""metroidvania"" games, this game is a disappointment.New and improved review with impressions I wrote up when asked for specifics about why I disliked the game so much.For the record, I spent somewhere in the neighborhood of 9-10 hours with Strider. It was just enough to get 100% and then delete it from my hard drive immediately. I can honestly say I will NEVER play that game again. EVER. And here's a list of reasons why:(1) There is no variety, in anything. There's two main types of levels -- futuristic cityscape and sewer. Maybe you could count the temple area... maybe... but it reminds me a lot of a blend between the sewer and the city. This makes it feel like you're never going anywhere.(2) Continuing the no variety, there's maybe about 6 enemy types throughout the whole game, not including bosses, and that MAY be including the stupid♥♥♥♥♥color coded enemies.(3) Speaking of, it has color coded enemies, enough said.(4) There is no challenge. At all, except for the first boss on hard if you haven't played before, the expected cyber gorilla fight because he does ridiculous damage, and one random encounter in the elevator on the ride up to the boss which is a difficulty spike of epic proportions on hard (I had 100% of the upgrades and only was able to manage it once I started using the gravity/purple slingshot for the special ability).(5) The game is short. Ridiculously short -- and there's nothing to make you really go back because the combat is just mashing x for the most part. My first run, collecting everything, on hard (first time playing) clocked in around 6.5 hours, give or take. My speed run to get the final achievement would've clocked in at under 2.25 hours easily, but I decided to go out of my way to get a few extra upgrades just to make sure I wouldn't have a problem with that poorly designed encounter in the final area.(6) The gameplay, at it's core, is extremely simple and ultimately boring. There is a practically useless upward attack mapped to Y, which was only ever useful for some of the reflecting projectiles from the wall cannons, so for the most part, combat is a total snoozefest. I was bored of the combat (and traversal mechanics) within the first 45 minutes or so and the only ability/upgrade that gave me any sort of repreive was the slingshot catapult which you get kind of late.(7) The ""cutscenes"" are some C-level voice acting. You would think this is some fan made Strider game that failed out of kickstarter and was made anyway judging by this stuff. Add in the ridiculous ""portraits"" that don't match and sprinkle in the non-existent story and that side of the game makes it so that gameplay (as usual) should be the reason to love the game if there was one. But based on the above points, there's nothing good about the gameplay, as far as I'm concerned. It's mediocre and boring, at it's best.(8) The lack of attention to detail really bothered me... I had a bunch of examples, but the one that always gets me is that from the very moment you take control of Hiryu, he has a pouch/pack on his shoulder containing kunai -- you get a very good look at it during one of the first parts of gameplay. And yet you don't actually get the kunai ability til 50% of the game is over. There were other examples, I'm sure, but this is the one that just stood out for me about all others.(9) The lack of NG+ kills any potential hope of replay value. Did you miss collectibles? Did you want to get every single retro ""collectible"" they hid in places (which are kinda lame themselves)? Oh, you already went to take on the final boss? Tough, start over from scratch. And I don't think they ever patched it in.(10) Beyond all this, the game had technical issues like crazy. While I never really encountered many, I have a pretty good graphics card and it's more than capable of handling the game as intended with DX11. But for those without such niceties? Good ♥♥♥♥in' luck.I could probably spout more reasons I did not like the game, but for me it was the most boring and disappointing way that Strider could have returned in his own game and I'd honestly rather have the PSX game via emulator or play the arcade rom in the Capcom collections on my Vita. My nostalgia hyped me up and the promo trailers they put together gave me hope for the game when I originally thought it would be bad since announce because I didn't like the 2.5D or the Metroidvania direction it was going in. I gave in, I got it for about $9 and made a bunch of that back via playfire rewards for 100%'ing the game. But I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone, ever, and I highly advise anyone interested make sure they check out one of the demos for the game on consoles if possible. If you own a PS4 and have PS+, get it that way, maybe you like it, maybe you have fun with it because your expectations were non-existant due to not knowing or caring about the Strider franchise. But as a die-hard Strider fan? This is not the game we deserved, not even close.So to be fair, my hatred of Strider comes from the intense disappointment I felt for the game. If you're not like me, you could probably play the game, maybe enjoy it for what it is, and it would be like a 7/10 max, but probably more like a 5.5-6.5. But for me? It's the most disappointment I've felt in gaming since January of 2002 -- where after 15-20 hours invested into FFX, I found that I did not like the game and thought it was terrible. And I kept pushing forward hoping that the next few hours would change my opinion... but it never happened. This is the same thing that occurred for me with Strider 2014. I kept pushing forward hoping it would get better and I would like it... and I never did. In fact, if I'm talking Capcom reboots, I would put DmC leagues above Strider... but that's another story.I know I talk like Strider came to my house, beat my dogs, and then♥♥♥♥♥♥in my microwave... and that's a bit of hyperbole... it happens because of the disappointment I had with it after letting my hopes and expectations rise the week before it's release.

												Strider is one of Capcom franchise that been on arcade in 1989.This is a 2D Side scrolling hack & slash game. It's a mixed of Megaman + Castelvania or Metroid.There are various skills and items to unlock in the game.Some item can't be reached at first because you have to unlock it with a certain skill.You will explore all the places over and over again because you just got a new skills.The boss fight isn't hard if you have know the pattern.I love this type of game because I love to play any game alike.

												Okay I saw this game and expected some high-quality remake like Bionic Commando Rearmed and Duck Tales Remastered. You know, they're great classic games, uplifted with polished graphics and sound, but honestly the whole point is to get that dose of retro nostalgia. If you didn't care, you might as well download the rom image and play the old version on an emulator for free, right? For a long time that's what I assumed Strider would be like.OH WOW WAS I WRONG.It's so much better than that. This game isn't about nostalgia at all, it was made out of a genuine love of old platformer games and strives to bring something fresh and exciting into that genre. It's like what kids back then thought future videogames would be like, a supercharged progression of what they already have, and now it's come true.Also, I'm convinced it's THE best ""metroidvania"" since Super Metroid. I never thought I'd say that.			"

												Hits all the right notes, while on normal it may be not all that difficult it still provides the right level of fun. The combat flows nicely and the Metroidvania elements add extra appeal to this hack and slash. If you've enjoy Dust: An Elysian Tale or Mark of the Ninja you'll likely enjoy this game as well. With a good sundtrack and great art direction keep the game never out stays its welcome clocking in around 5-7 hrs. If you gather all the items and complete all the challenge modes you're looking upwards to 20hrs though. It's worth the price but if you're still not convinced pick it up on a sale. I doubt this will be a purchase you'll regret.			"

												Love it!Loved the old NES and Genesis versions but this just kicks the hell out of them. A lot of passion went into creating this and it shows big time. The music, sound design, game play, art and graphics, character animation, level design is all fantastic. The story is weak but that is perfect--I think too heavy of a story would have held back the fast-paced rush of this game.This is back to the old style of 2D gaming I grew up with but with a 2.5D punch. You feel like a damn hero playing this game. I miss that!! They also kept the ""Soviet"" influence we remember from the pre-90s and amped it up to be more present throughout the game for a more futuristic dystopia. Actually...maybe...unfortunately not so futuristic. Listen to the propaganda in this game and it sounds familiar.UPDATE: Forgot to mention I used a Logitech Precision gamepad. Like Bionic Commando Rearmed, I had issues with it being recognized. There is not a gamepad setup in-game, so I had to use the Logitech Profiler to assign the keystrokes and it worked fine.			"

												A sidescroller where you control a samurai-esque character. The game starts off with two attacks and the jump button - as you progress and defeat bosses more movements are introduced. Everything just feels very slick, polished, and futuristic, the controls are responsive and it is easy to land attacks on your ennemies no matter what you are doing, you can gradually change your direction in mid-air, you can hook onto just about any surface and everything looks way cool. Game gives a greate sense of empowerement through and through. Very nice sci fi anime look to everything.Tags : Sidescroll - Brawler			"

												Genre - Japanese Sci-Fi Action/PlatformI played the original back on the Atari ST and I don't remember getting much past the first boss, but I still enjoyed it. This is a change of pace with difficulty settings and power ups to help even the odds. The graphics look ace and Strider is a cool character to play. The bosses can be a challenge even on the easier modes.  It can get a bit repetitive though so I would recommend playing it in small doses.			"

												Strider is the sort of man who flies a hang glider into a warzone. He doesn’t get bogged down in the details, preferring instead to slice first and ask questions later. His latest hack-and-slash action game is the same way. Without preamble or pretext, you’re dropped straight into the action, cleaving through one hapless guard after another. Strider’s capacity for carnage is boundless, and the acrobatic precision with which he dispatches his foes makes him a delight to control. Right away, you have everything at your disposal to feel like a one man army, and as your arsenal grows, so too will your enjoyment of this well-crafted game.Simply being Strider feels great. The way he moves from running to sliding to climbing a wall to bisecting a robot is so seamless that you feel like a tempest on the battlefield. From the arc of his jump to the range of his slide, all of Strider’s movements are perfectly measured to give you complete command of the action. In the beginning you can do little more than jump and slash, but by exploring the world and defeating powerful bosses, Strider unlocks new techniques for his arsenal. Reflecting bullets, throwing knives, and summoning a eagle made of pure energy are just some of the powers you earn, and those powers expand your fighting repertoire in new and interesting ways. Instead of mindlessly cutting down the competition, you could send your eagle to intercept airborne foes while you take out those on the ground. Alternatively, you could employ a long-range strategy using the throwing knives and reflection cypher to dispatch foes from afar.Whichever you choose, juggling these powers together is a real delight, and cartwheeling through the air while dispensing death at 360 degrees is extremely empowering. There are plenty of locked doors to be found early in your quest with no means of entry--this is the game’s way of teasing you with the promise of new powers--and they grant you no choice but to pass them by. As you unlock new powers, referred to as cyphers, you are able to return to these spots and open the doors associated with your new cypher. This can help you advance along the main storyline or reward you with hidden unlockables such as concept art and new costumes.As you acquire new cyphers, Strider's scarf color will change to indicate which cypher you currently have active.While Strider’s world is filled with surprises, the backdrop itself is disappointingly drab. The game looks slick and clean, with a subtle scanline effect that harkens back to the ninja’s arcade roots. However, the moment you touch down you’re greeted with a futuristic, industrial aesthetic that rarely relents as you progress. Gloomy pipes and heavy machinery follow you wherever you go, splashed with all the browns, greys, and whites you can handle. Admittedly, this style has the benefit of making Strider--in all his crimson-scarfed glory--pop against the background, but even so, more variety in the different arenas would have been welcome.Certain enemies also sport a splash of color to indicate a weakness to a particular cypher. Against such a foe, Strider must switch to the appropriate cypher and use it to disable the enemy’s defenses--most often a color-coded shield--before dispatching him. These enemies help keep fights feeling dynamic as they force you to mix up your tactics and utilize Strider to his fullest. One cypher, the cold cypher, does rise above the rest with its incredibly powerful ability to quickly freeze enemies. Frozen enemies can take no action, and are locked in place for several seconds. Other cyphers add to the enjoyable chaos of Strider's combat, but the cold cypher does the opposite. It simplifies encounters and feels more like a crutch than a compliment to your other abilities.Unlike most rank-and-file grunts, Strider's bosses maneuver around the arena making them very different--and enjoyable--encounters.Once you finish Strider’s main adventure, you can try your hand at the game’s challenge modes. These challenges come in two varieties: survival and beacon run. Survival challenges are all about testing your combat prowess. You’re granted a pre-selected loadout of cyphers and turned loose against wave after wave of enemies. Beacon runs, on the other hand, are all about speed and agility. Your goal is to pass through each of the beacons on your way to the goal, all the while navigating a trap-and-enemy-infested environment. This mode is especially welcome since Strider is so fun to control and the main game rarely tests your platforming capabilities. When a challenge is completed, you are graded on your performance and can compare your stats against others on challenge-specific leaderboards.From the moment you embark on your journey right up until the final deathblow, Strider is a blast to play. Controlling this agile ninja feels empowering right out of the gate, and each new upgrade brings with it an enjoyable new way to engage your foes. While his world is a little drab there’s still plenty to explore even after the job is done. Strider is fun, pure and simple, and serves as a fitting revival of a classic video game hero.Strider / PlayStation 4 & Xbox One / PCThe Good    Strider himself is wonderfully fun to control     Steady stream of new powers and enemies keeps combat fresh     Beacon run challenges let you flex your platforming musclesThe Bad    Strider’s world is rather dull and repetitive     The cold cypher is too powerful8    Great  "

												While not stunningly great, Strider is pretty solid experience from start to finish. While buying I was worried that this game may not deliver its promises. Luckily for me, most of those dark predictions were proven untrue. The biggest problem of this game is that it could use a tad bigger budget. Some areas like voice acting, textures and level variety could use some more polish and work. This is most noticeable while navigating the main menu which in contrast to action packed game, is pretty dull. Not very Capcom-like. There are just some aspects of this game that contrast to the great ideas and design decisions in gameplay department. I also lamented the lack of interesting story that could frame the adventure in broader context. In this situation only the gameplay pushes us to finish the game. This complements mechanics, but plot-less game still feels a bit empty. That said, Strider delivers... This is a button-mash-through-your-enemies gameplay at its finest. Press attack button as fast as you can and see how those Techno Commies are sliced into pieces. Yes, I said Techno Commies. There are also some robotic dragons, panthers, eagles, mad scientists, weird martial-arts sisters and bounty hunters as bosses and all other cool characteristic Capcom-esque stuff. Action is explosive and it rarely slows down. I like it. Otherwise, this is a solid made metroidvania game which spoils you with upgrades every time you explore a bit. Feels rewarding. In conclusion, while production values and the plot disappoint in places, the gameplay drives this game nicely to its home destination. Recommended to all fans of action platformer genre.			"

You start at one point of a level and sprint across it to another, dimembering anything cybernetic that might get in your way. The levels look great, too.

												Strider is a great, fast-paced Metroidvania game that is fun to play.  It's a bit on the shorter side (you can complete the game in under 4 hours), and the collectable/""Metroidvania"" aspect of the game isn't focused on too deeply.  Most of the collectables are within the grasp of where you're supposed to be story-wise, so you never have to veer too far off-path.  I don't think there are any puzzles or any really tricky collectables, so it is missing out on some of the complexity that other games of the same genre have.  The combat and how smooth the game plays makes up for it though, in my opinion.Strider, however, has one major problem.  It tends to crash.  A lot.  My first bits of gameplay were enjoyable, with the game running perfectly fine without any issues whatsoever.  As I progressed further into the game, Strider crashed more and more often.  I'm not exactly sure why, but it is an issue that other users are havnig as well (there's enough proof of it in the forums).  While I've had no problem trying to play through this game constantly crashing (enemies aren't hard to face and it doesn't take too long to progress so it's somewhat manageable), it is definitely annoying (and even impossible if you can't get to the next checkpoint without it crashing).  Although it's an enjoyable game, the constant crashing makes it nearly unplayable.  You can still progress, but just hope that you reach the next checkpoint before your game decides to give out on you.  I can't recommend it in its current state, and who knows if the devs will ever look into this problem and fix it. Don't buy unless you either get it in a bundle, or the devs fix it.			"

												The general hack-and-slash gameplay is good, its fluid for the most part and doesn't stop unless you mess up. Bosses on the other hand blow, 4 of them are almost the same fight. 2 more are nearly identical. Every time you die to a boss you get to watch the same cutscene(s) again before getting another shot, including the one where you're told its name and title. You can skip some of the cutscenes with ESC but not the introduction ones. Writing is bland. Footsoldiers are palette swaps of eachother and sometimes carry shields or guns that inflict different status effects. With the exception of shield enemies none of them pose any challenge. Shield enemies require a charged attack which also doesn't pose any problems as long as you don't face a guantlet of them. Heavy enemies are also palette swaps of eachother and more powerful versions just mean they get an additional attack. They're damage sponges too, not much skill required just lots of jumping. Players have a meter which fills by damaging enemies and avoiding getting hit. Next to impossible to fill during normal gameplay until you get the deflection power up, bullet hell guantlets force you to use it if you want to fill the meter. Unfortunately enemies in later areas have increased health and the deflection power up doesn't do nearly as much damage as the flaming one. The flaming one of course doesn't deflect bullets so the Charge meter doesn't see much use. Really aggravating to get hit by electricity, you can often get stunlocked. Level design is decent but not overly complex. The ease with which you travel was clearly put ahead of complicated or intricate designs. Some hazards instantly kill you (sending you back to a checkpoint) and some do not, its unclear which is which until you find out the hard way. Sometimes fails to load an area if you move too fast (such as by using the dash rings) allowing you to get outside the level boundaries, freqently locking you out of the level proper when it occurs. Looks nice but looses frame rate during certain areas such as obstacle courses or areas with lots of electricity giving you a slow motion effect.tl;dr: Running and slashing is fun, bosses and cutscenes suck.

												Strider is awesome, fans of the original and indeed any of the side scrolling classics such as castlevania or metroid will feel right at home playing this game, its is the kind of game one can get familiar with and speed run, at its highest dificulty i'd say only the mecha gorilla and the last boss pose a threat, but that doesnt mean to say the game is easy, i'd say its enjoyable enough for veterans of the genre  to blaze their way through and intuitive enough that allows beginners to settle in and enjoy this awesome hack/slash/shoot rpg platformer.All the characters and levels are beautifully sculpted and the game really excels in its overall visual appeal.Controls are smooth and on point.My only gripe is there is really no replayability unless you are trying to do speed runs, once you unlock evrything and finish the main story that is it, i guess that isnt a bad thing per say i just felt that perhaps there could be chalenge levels or even a level editor to it.i'll give Strider a solid 8/10certainly a game you should experience once in your life.

												What I liked most about this game was the focus on old school game fundamentals. The game takes the formula from the old Strider games and only expands the map size a bit. There’s hardly any dialogue or cutscenes at all. It’s no-nonsense ninja sidescroller action. I can’t remember the last time I played something that felt this stripped down and focused. Even the logos when you start the game go past faster than other games. This is the game for everyone who’s ever complained about modern game trends, and that they “just want to play the game”. It does this without wallowing in nostalgia. This isn’t a retro sidescroller, this is better than them.I had a good feeling about Strider after I saw a clip of it, but even so I was pleasantly surprised by how good it is. It does basic things right, such as putting the coolest stuff at the end, and the second coolest stuff right before that, and so on. The controls are as responsive as the Itagaki Ninja Gaiden games, and details like the sound design augment how good it feels just to move around and do things. I only have minor quibbles with it like how mouths don’t animate in cutscenes, and that you can’t skip some of them when you retry bosses. On the whole it’s one of the best sidescrollers I’ve ever played. Sections of the game had me thinking of Turrican 2, which is always a good thing. I loved it.			"

												I don't know Strider from anything outside of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, so you won't find a hint of nostalgia in this review. It doesn't need it though, being as expansive and fast-paced a platformer as it is. There are plenty of metroidvanias out there but I can't think of many that let you play as a spastic cyber-ninja, and that's just as fun as it sounds. Despite a few design hangups it stays fun the whole way through, too, so it's an easy recommendation for an action-heavy take on the genre.Strider dumps you into the cyberboots of Strider Hiryu, out on a mission to kill the mysterious despot who rules the world from high-tech Kazakh City. This isn't really explained in the game intro which drops you into the snowy outskirts of the city, leaving you to pick up the pieces of the story through the game's terribly talkative bosses. I can't say I minded too much because right from that intro I was somersault-slashing robot soldiers into cyberfillets and speeding across rooftops, and at that point I wasn't questioning it.This game wastes no time in getting you to the action, so I'll waste no time lauding them for it: This is one of the most viscerally fun metroidvanias out there to tear around in. Combat in Strider is always fast-paced, kinetic, and full of possibilities. Your spry protagonist will quickly unlock a full suite of combat moves including charged slashes, sliding kicks, diving strikes, and air dashes. Even his basic attack is a lightning-fast swing you can rapid-fire like the Crissaegrim from Symphony of the Night, in any direction no less. On top of that are the plasma types, allowing Strider's sword to reflect bullets or freeze enemies, throwing knives which can share those plasmas, and three combat options like a holographic panther and orbiting drones.All of those tools will be necessary for cutting down the hundreds of cybernetic foes standing in your way. Enemy troops carry all kinds of firearms and almost every group has a shield soldier to dispatch with a charged slash or a specific plasma. Then there are flying drones, turrets, and larger mechanical menaces that make for longer encounters. You'll need to be agile to take on beefier foes but flipping willy-nilly all over a giant robot as you hack it up never gets old here. Once you master the movement you can control the flow of battles, slipping between shots and removing threats as you see fit.Your swift, fluid movement will help you traverse the vast metropolis of Kazakh City as well. The map is divided into thematic districts, from rain-soaked cityscapes to cramped industrial complexes to vast underground caverns. Strider starts the game with the ability to cling to and climb along any surface, walls and ceilings included, which greatly multiplies the spaces that can conceal secrets. And indeed, there is stuff to find stuffed into every corner of the sprawling world. This is actually one place where the game's design works against it, because the levels are a little too vast to comfortably retread to find new secrets. There's no fast travel system either, so hiking back to the starting areas can be a laborious undertaking.The level design is definitely the weakest part of Strider, which is a pretty big deal for a metroidvania. And it's doubly painful because the levels LOOK great, with tons of little details in the fully-3D landscapes. But all that detail can make it tricky to pick out the walls and platforms in the foreground, especially when things get cramped. They get cramped pretty often as well, with many levels going overboard on long, featureless halls to sprint down. Strider's normal running speed makes this less of an issue, until you need to backtrack somewhere. But that's the other part that got to me, the backtracking. It's to be expected in any metroidvania especially after you score a new power, but here it feels particularly forced. You'll be sent to a new level to do something and all of a sudden you'll get a notice that you need a new option or plasma to proceed. It could be as simple as one locked door between you and your goal, but the game will happily send you through three enormous side levels to get a new power to open that damn door. Or it might arbitrarily send you back to the middle of an early level, or into a back entrance of an old map, or so on. It's not the worst thing in the world since you get more to explore, it just tends to be terribly arbitrary.I feel pretty confident that the action will help push you through the worst offences of the level design, though. The fights never get boring and the bosses all have fun gimmicks and lots of dynamic attacks. Strider isn't a terribly difficult game on normal, either, so it should be clear sailing right up to the final area. The journey will take you a good 5 or 6 hours and there are additional difficulties and challenge modes to top it off. The sound design is great, with plenty of rich metallic tones and a pumping soundtrack to keep you pushing on. The graphics are nice and clean but leave the characters looking stiff and plasticky in the cutscenes, but at this point I'm just nitpicking. There are certainly nits to pick but honestly if you like metroidvanias and ninjas, just get it and immerse yourself in hours of quality skulking and slashing.			"

												Strider is the name, and the game is speed. Very fast, high paced, no compromise, 360 degree platforming action. An effective cross-breed between free-running and a metroidvania style map makes this a modern day halmark for the genre and the series.So the original strider was a platformer with some sick hack 'n' slash elements. It had cool moves and a whickedly long sword that was fast to boot. You'd make your way from one end of the level to the next while slashing everything to bits; including the Soviet parliament. Good times.The new version is not a remake; more like an emulation and update. With the finesse of today's hardware Strider has been made more agile, and faster. Everything about him is smooth and flexible. You can attacks in eight directions, while in motion, on any surface. Ok, not while hanging from a ceiling, but it is still more than you're getting from Simon Belmont. The flexibility of Strider's movement options is so amazing you'd wish you could play other games with them. Along with the fluid movement options you also acquire a number of powers. Like shield drones, energy panthers and power hawks, along with elemental powers and kunai. All these tools are needed to fend off the never ending tide of conscripted enemies and bosses. You can clear a room on the fly, but sometimes you need to stop and think and moderate your approach before being gunned down by a crossfire of machinegun bullets. It is awesome and fun to deal with obstacles in such a fast and agile way. It helps keep the pace up and the fun coming.You make your way through an open world, with indicators telling you where to go. Certain abilities unlock new areas, just like in the classic Metroid games (I'm calling them classic now; I have little faith in Nintendo at this time). This sends you round the world with the option to go back for more powerups or to plow on ahead, straight for the boss' head. Three ways the game offers you a level of freedom. In movement, in combat, and in exploration. The game takes a step back from it's Soviet roots and propells you into a Soviet controlled neo-industrialist nation that is being opressed by a powerhungry madman. Standard fare. Not much time is spent on story or expostion. Just so you can get back to that sweet high speed action all the faster.			"

												It's a Metroidvania.  You're a ninja.No, seriously, that's all I have to say to try to sell you.  The combat is sleek, the gameplay in general is smooth.  Most of the powerups are in plain view, while some of the collectables are really hard to find.  Basically, Strider goes out of the way to not break the game's flow.  Falling in a pit or hitting a laser moves you back to the last solid surface with a small amount of life loss.  Even full-on death happens shows a quick ""mission failed"" screen, and moves you back to the last checkpoint, which are pretty frequent.The story was really weak, but it's not a story-centric game.

												Solid Metrovania style game that does the original version proud. There can be a few times where the game may seem unfair but if you rethink your approach and use the provided skillsets those challenges can become much easier. The only thing I wish I could change would be the dialogue between characters as it's a bit tiring and melodramatic. If you want a good game to kill an afternoon with than I would easily recommend Strider.			"

NINJA VS. ROBOT DRAGON! | Strider, Episode 1 
A Video of Strider
By: Murdoc

			Paul tries being a ninja in Strider! He's not very good at the whole ""stealth"" bit. Please thumbs up if you liked this video and don't forget to subscribe!		


This up front: I have played the old arcade Strider game from long, long ago.That aside, I still quite enjoy this game. The action is quick and flashy and, most importantly, fun.It feels and runs like a solid, 2D, action platformer. It gives you upgrades that significantly change gameplay as you go on, throws new enemies at you every major ""level"", and is, simply, quite fun.It CAN have its frustrating moments, however. Sometimes it's bad about telling you where you need to go, as sometimes the arrow on the minimap seems to bug out or simply not point in an intuitive direction. There has been a time or two that the game's difficulty jumped up quickly on me for a section out of nowhere. Despite this, I recommend it, especially if you can snag it on a sale.			"

The bosses are enjoyable to fight but seem a little to easy and that rings true for the entire game aswell. Theres alot of collecting, outfits etc etc and I do suggest you try and collect them all to get the most from the game.

												Strider Hiryu, ready for battle.Now this is how you do a reboot of a franchise. Capcom has done an amazing job bringing back one of their beloved franchises in Strider (2014). The game is beautiful, fast, frantic and simply alot of fun to play. No other game makes you feel like such a badass ninja such as this one.Story: The story is nothing to write home about. It is pretty stock standard, the Strider organization sends their best assassin, Hiryu, to kill the dictator Grandmaster Meio who currently rules with an iron fist in Kazakh City. The plot is pretty paper thin and is only there to progress the gameplay.Graphics: On high graphics settings, Strider is a joy to look at. The character textures are super crisp, colours are vibrant and pop off the screen and the landscapes are incredibly pretty. Capcom has done well to modernize the game yet keep the charm of the original arcade classic released in 1989.Sound: The soundtrack is fantastic to listen to. The composers of the game have done well to remix old tunes such that they sound fresh yet familiar and harken back to the glory days of the arcades in the 80s to 90s. The sound of Hiryu's blade cutting through enemies is very satisfying and the laser blasts have a nice retro sound to them. Each of the villains are voiced admirably, being cheesy yet fun to listen to.Gameplay: Strider's gameplay is just too much fun. The game moves at a much faster pace than the original arcade game and I think is better for it. You can rapidly tap the X button on the Xbox 360 to slice and dice your way through enemies and use the trigger buttons in combination with the A button, to quickly dash through the air and jump through obstacles. Each of the gameplay elements is refined to a tee and is a pleasure to play.Overall, Strider is a fantastic reboot of a much loved arcade franchise. It is the perfect example of how to create a modern take on a series and yet still remain faithful to the original's spirit.There should be alot more remakes like this one.9.5/10.			"

												Back in 1989, Strider was released in the arcades. It's basically how International Relations would go if the participants were  futuristic ninja assassins, robots, and god-like evil entities. The game turned out to be a success, paving the way for a couple of sequels, fighting game cameos, and so on. However, along the way something was lost. Kouichi Yotsui aka ""Isuke"" was the visionary behind the original Strider. After leaving Capcom he designed a similar arcade game by the name of Osman / Cannon Dancer, and most recently Moon Dancer (XBLA/PSN). He left behind a blueprint for all subsequent Strider games, and Capcom hasn't done much to deviate from it.Strider (Arcade/Genesis/various ports) stars Strider Hiryu. He battles the evil grandmaster Meio, faces off against a trio of female assassins, slays the bounty hunter Solo, and cuts through a cyborg/mutant/??? army. He climbs walls & ceilings, and finds power-upsStrider 2 (Arcade/PSX) stars Strider Hiryu. He battles the evil grandmaster Meio, faces off against a trio of female assassins, slays the bounty hunter Solo, and cuts through a cyborg/mutant/??? army. He climbs walls & ceilings, and finds power-ups.Strider 2014 (Current-gen platforms) stars Strider Hiryu. He battles the evil grandmaster Meio, faces off against a trio of female assassins, slays the bounty hunter Solo, and cuts through a cyborg/mutant/??? army. He climbs walls & ceilings, and finds power-ups.Note that I'm being exceedingly unfair in these descriptions. There are numerous differences between the three games, ranging from mechanics to level-designs to bosses. The story never changes though, and each itineration feels safer than the last. Unlike the previous games, Strider 2014 is an action-adventure game. Progress is tied to exploration, and Strider comes across abilities that help him reach new areas. Also unlike the previous games, Strider's cypher (sword-thingie) has multiple modes. For example, he can deflect bullets, or cause explosions, and even freeze enemies. Most of the time players will stick to the one mode that fits their play-style, only switching to others when it's absolutely necessary (color-coded shield enemies....ugh).The most common enemy in this game is the overly-standard grunt with a gun. It seems that Strider brought a cypher to a gun-fight, but his maneuverability allows him to close gaps in a hurry. Battles tend to be exceedingly one-sided, with Strider easily cutting through everyone. Larger foes make rare appearances, and you can't have an action-adventure-platformer without flying enemies. Still, this game doesn't have any style. The military's lack of imagination is painfully apparent, when every room is filled with GWGs, big mechs, turrets, FEs, and zombies. Early on there's a fight with an elite who uses a double-bladed staff, he doesn't show up again until the end of the game. Nobody ever gets the bright idea to try anything original. Strider is killing everyone and finding kickass abilities, and the military can't come up with anything more than more guys with guns? More guns with guys? Guns guns and guns that gun? Give me a break. At least the bosses try to be different, and for the most part they're pretty good. When not slicing through foes more generic than the last, Strider is exploring each area for upgrades, costumes, and art unlocks. Acquiring some of these treasures requires the usage of different abilities, and it's nothing that hasn't been done before. At least getting around is fluid, and the mid-air dash is very handy. The environments never seem to graduate from cold & sterile though. I guess this is to be expected in Neo-Russia, and I can't imagine that Strider would suddenly run through an Amazon forest, but it leads to every area being too similar to one another. The mechanics of this game are solid enough, but nothing stands out. There was a level of finesse to the first game, and you really had to be on-point with your movements and jumps. Here, it doesn't seem all that necessary. In a way it's nice, because the original Strider has a punishing level of difficulty. However, I tend to get lulled into a state of complacency. The damage I take is largely irrelevant due to large number of health-replenishing capsules, and whatever traps I run into take a mere sliver of life. Granted, I played on the normal difficulty, and I died a few times, but the idea of replaying on the hard difficulty, just doesn't sound appealing. Enemies in this game also tend to be sword-sponges. By that I mean they take a lot of hits until their vitals give way and they're split into pieces. There is a charged attack for dealing with everyone quickly, but the kunai tend to be more effective after a few upgrades. Also, while the first game had ""blink and you'll miss it"" amounts of violence when Strider killed someone, it still looked really cool. Here? It just isn't the same. Since practically no blood is spilled, the combat isn't as satisfying. It's fun weaving in-between the bullets, but the pay-off isn't there. All that said, Strider 2014 isn't a bad game. My review might make it sound that way, but I believe it functions properly enough. The controls are suitable, the bosses are solid, i's are dotted and t's are crossed where it matters. It is a perfectly safe product for consumption. I just don't think it's exciting. The original Strider was rare, almost alien in quality, and every moment feels weird and interesting. Strider 2 is more standardized, but still works as an enjoyable arcade game. Strider 2014 checks all of the boxes for what can be considered an ok or even a good game, but it's so safe and bland I'll probably forget I even played through it a month from now. Moon Dancer? It's a piece of crap, but at least it played around with new ideas. In short, this is a decent game but I don't recommend it.			"

												First the bad:-The game can feel short. -It sometimes feels like it lacks a little bit of depth compared to what one would expect from a metroidvania nowadays.-If you're experienced on the genre, the game might feel a little bit unchallenging. (though, I've yet to play it on harder modes)-The story feels quite 2D for a game that has such a gorgeous 3d.The good:-The gameplay is perfect. You really feel like a badass and deadly futuristic ninja. It's fast, is fluid, is flashy. You'll not get this quality of rushing-through-enemies-while-they-break-apart-The graphics are, again, gorgeous. An excellent combination of scenary and level design showcases beautiful places that are pleasant to the eye.-The character design. Even if the story and dialogue feels a little bit lacking, the characters are all funny and even memorable. From the cackling filled of hubris mercenary, to the blinded water-priest, ending with an interesting this-is-not-even-my-final-form villain.			"

												Extremely fun game. The controls of strider really make you feel like you're running super fast. Good soundtrack and the bosses were just the right amount of hard for me to get by after learning their patterns. The only times I got frustrated with the game were trying to understand how the gravity controls worked. Other than that, I would highly recommend. I didn't pay much attention to the story but I was having too much fun dashing through the levels to notice.			"

												It's been a while since I played this genre, a metroidvania that is played on 2D but has 2.5D graphics. No fps loss and spikes whatsoever and the graphics are very intuitive except on bosses. Settings gave me an option to set it @ 99 hz or 119 hz but it was still locked @ 59fps. Not a big deal, just found weird.I really liked the first 1-2 hours of the game, it slowly gives you the abilities on the game making it feel like a tutorial after the first boss. As you continue on the game, you are presented with up to 4 different plasmoids and with their different uses with the kunai having a secondary effect as well. The pacing was just great.The difficulty scaling on enemies is perfect and all the bosses are unique though some can be cheesed especially the second evolution of the final boss. It was the most underwhelming boss fight even though it was also the final one.The controls are somewhat finicky on keyboard when aiming for the kunai as well when sticking on walls, but that might be just me sometimes since I always want to charge your attack (holding the atk button). Despite of that, the fighting controls feels very responsive and you get this nice feeling when you are juggling you plasmoids on bosses.The game has been bundled twice now but if you missed those and are planning to get it, I'd buy this at least 50% since it is quite short but nevertheless you'll have great fun with it.Overall Rating: 81%			"

												A little romp of a game about mashing the attack button and jumping around everywhere.  Not nearly insane enough to be a proper strider game though, even though all of the dialogue is stunningly stupid.   In my 4 hour run of the game I stumbled into a handful of pretty wild bugs where I got trapped in the walls, and then one where I died while beating the first form of the final boss resulting in the game crashing and then loading my save with me unable to attack,  use the catapult move, or reenter the final showdown area again. I manged to fix by leaving the zone, by kind of sliding through a door I shouldn't have been able to without the launch move, closing the game and loading my save again. Just like in real life doors complain that you aren't attacking them with the right kind of sword.			"

												In a nutshell it is Metroid Ninja Flavour.Strider is honestly a great looking, smooth handling metroidvania. The only real complaints I have are that the boss difficulty felt a little all over the place (mostly with physically larger bosses being very easy to cheese with a certain upgrade) and with the lack of a central hub/quick travel system it is a hideous chore to go back and collect previously unobtainable powerups. Even the in-game map doesn't tell you which borders are the area transitions and where they lead to.It's a touch short but of course there is always hard mode or finding 100% of the collectibles if you have a compulsive need to fulfill some kind of $X/hr of entertainment rate.

Simply because this is the Strider game we deserve.This game aces everything.Those of you that have played any of the previous Strider games, will be familiar with the hack n slash gameplay and unique acrobatic approach.You get collectable upgrades as well as new powers/abilities after defeating a boss, new enemies appear around every corner, with that in mind the challenge feels fair and balanced.Add Metroidvania elements to all of that and you've got yourself a fun,challenging and unique experience with comfortable and soothing controls.  Besides slightly dated graphics and cheesy voice acting, the game is great and a must buy for any Strider fans as it certainly deserves a chance.    "

												Story: The dystopian atmosphere (think 1984 but with robot enforcers) is nice, but when the characters start talking (good and bad guys) it makes the experience a bit too cheesy.Gameplay: Not smooth/responsive like a Megaman game. The game helps you so you can't have perfect accuracy with anything. Some areas and bosses have cheap things meant to kill you the first time facing them. Combat variety consists of unlocking a new color (red main, yellow fire, blue ice, purple boomerang) and switching between them (which isn't very smooth and only the boomerang has new animations) for the enemy types.  Map/World is connected, so lots of backtracking to get to your next destination.Sound: Generally good for the gameplay and music. Voices are atrociously bad. Some bosses (notably the dragons) have 16 bit sound effects for some moves for whatever reasons.Graphics: Looks very cool. No moving lips during dialogues though. That and animated/comic cutscenes weren't in the budget.Summary: Not as good as it could have been, but not as bad either. I was expecting something deeper gameplay-wise and Strider is a modern team's attempt to create an older experience. But they make too many artificial decisions rather than let the game flow like it should. Despite that I'm still inclined to recommend it, but just as okay and with caution towards its many flaws/""design choices"". It's not quite the high production game I was (and you might be) expecting.			"

												Strider is one of those few old games that doesn't get the giant cult of nostalgia it actually deserves. There were several versions, the original taking the form of a difficult but innovative action platformer with excellent animation for its time. The version I played many times was the NES version, which was one of the earliest examples of the famous ""Metroidvania"" style of gameplay where gaining levels and abilities unlocked new opportunities in levels you had already visited previously.This new version of Strider boldly sports both playstyles. It pays homage to the NES version with its sprawling levels filled with hidden secrets and upgrades, but it stays true to its arcade roots with lightning fast action and fast, fun boss encounters (you'll recognize all of them if you were a fan of the original). It's basically a retelling of the original story too (what little there was) so you don't need to be a fan to get into this EXCELLENT game.Did I mention it's only $15?			"

												Deserves the 'Metroidvania' tag, doesn't deserve the 'ninja' tag because there's no stealth + nice skill progression, I had no clue at the beginning and 8 hours later, I had beaten hard mode.+fluent movement that motivates + level design and respawning that keep the frustration level in the yellow zone+ music and sound fit the speed and add to the atmosphere+ awesome boss fights- a really minimalistic approach to a equally minimalistic story. I restarted twice because I thought there must have been an intro cutscene that explains who I am and what's going on. Well, there is none and even after the final cutscene, I didn't really have a clue why I was killing all those enemies. There are unlockable story entries though that are hidden within the levels.- not much variety when it comes to weapons and enemy types. You can get 4 weapons that also unlock doors of the same colour. They are pretty different but it could have been more variety. Same goes for enemies, even the big ones appear again and again. At least you got the tactics correctly at the end.- no stealth, would have been nice though.			"

												Fantastic action-platformer with some metroidvania-style gameplay elements. It combines the best of all older Strider games, like the arcade machines, the NES game, and the later adaptations for home consoles. It throws them into a blender, and underlines the delicious mix with flawless visuals, pumping sound effects, an excellent soundtrack, fluid and responsive controls, awesome boss battles, and a gameplay that has perfectly tuned difficulty settings. Hunting down collectibles and extra challenge modes will give you plenty of extra re-play value, as well.And yes: you will see gravity break. Just as you should in any good Strider game. The gravity-warped areas are back. So are the Four Winds, Solo, and facing off with Grandmaster Meio.This. This is how you remake an old game series. This is the definitive Strider experience.			"

												This game brings a heavy dose of nostalgia. It's fast paced, smooth and, with a few exceptions, controls nicely. Artistically, I think it looks great with a modern and almost cartoon like appearance particularly in the backgrounds. My main complaint is lack of enemy and environment variation. You'll be fighting the same guys over and over and most of them serve to just get in your way as they're almost on 1 - 2 shot kills. Everyting takes places within a gloomy futuristic Eurasian-like setting.In keeping with its nostalgic feeling, the game doesn't improve upon gameplay very much from its 1989 counterpart. There's running, wall climbing and anti-gravity platforming.Sound is mediocre and, in keeping with Capcom tradition, the voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard.Fairly quick to play, this game easy with the rare frustrating moment. All in all I enjoyed it and didn't blow me away.6.5/10 "

												Don't be fooled by the modern look: Strider is still an arcade game at its core. The one thing to be aware of is that this is by no means a metroidvania game: there's a map and a few traversal abilities, but the navigator always points you in the right direction, and detours only lead to basic upgrades. The focus is not on the exploration at all, but rather on avoiding enemies and environmental dangers, be it by deflecting bullets, or wall-climbing, or blinking: ""fast"" is the keyword here.The combat is extremely straightforward, relying mostly on oldschool button mashing with no combos. A rather big flaw can be found in the game's pacing, lacking any new combat option or major upgrade for the first couple hours, which might be a boring start for most players. Mid-game onwards, though, the combat becomes more engaging, balancing button mashing with more precise striking in order to reflect bullets, ranged options and cool ""special"" abilities, without ever slowing down the action. The level design actually encourages making full use of the strider's arsenal, mixing plasma swords (reflecting, explosive, freezing, magnetic) and turning an otherwise too-straightforward, one-button combat into a fun, fast hack'n'slash. Despite lacking tight, tactical approaches, or complex enemy movesets, the combat still feels engaging and satisfying.With fun and speed at its core, the game doesn't slow down on any meaningful story or characters' background, instead throwing at the player a number of bosses with little context but very solid ideas, at least visually. This is probably where the futuristic, cyber-warfare setting shines the most.Additional game modes (time trials, enemy/boss rush) can be unlocked by finding collectibles, for those who find the game too short (it actually is). This, coupled with the lack of any real customization and very linear progression, speaks clearly about how Strider retains its arcade soul, compelling the player to play just for the fun of slashing away at cyber-troops with style.Despite a few shortcomings, Strider manages to turn a very oldschool concept into a fun, fast paced game, even by today standards, aided by some neat polish and good visuals. It doesn't want to be a metroidvania, it doesn't add customization or rpg elements, it just sticks with the classic hack'n'slash and makes it fun and good to look at. The one highlight of Strider is that it perfectly nails the feeling of being a badass ninja with stylish powers fighting an army of cyber-soldiers. An amusing experience, to be sure.			"

Controls are tight and smooth, levels are laid out in that great metroidvania style of peeling back layers as you upgrade your abilities, and boss battles are unique and challenging experiences.

												Pretty good 2d hack'n'slash metroidvania.You run around several different locations hacking down enemies with your sword, killing bosses, and gaining upgrades that allow you to access previously inaccessible locations.  You'll start off weak and grow more powerful with every upgrade including more health, more energy, long range attacks, etc.  Enemies and bosses have tactics and weaknesses that you learn and exploit.  There's not really much of a story to the game, you're there to assassinate the baddie, that's pretty much it.  Characters aren't really explored and are cliche for the most part.  Expect the dialogue to be not so good.  Game is pretty much constant action/exploration which makes it enjoyable.The game does have several issues.  The biggest is probably the wall grapple controls.  You can attach to almost every wall/ceiling in the game and move around.  Getting off of these can be problematic at times.  You'll press the jump button to detach and instead he'll keep on hanging there.  The game automatically moves you up platforms if you get to the edge of them instead of waiting for a prompt from you to do so.  This can get annoying at times if you're trying to get close to the edge of a platform without wanting to go up on it.The second problem is that the difficulty is inconsistent.  I played on hard and while I found the very beginning to be sufficiently difficult, it got easier from there, especially once you get the first 2-3 health upgrades pretty quickly.  Some areas are overabundant in health pickups & killing enemies gives you a little health back as well.  Save points recover all missing health.  There's occasionally an area or two where the difficulty spikes for a little, but not too often.  Once you learn the basics of enemies, they'll usually give you little problems.   Later on, you can usually just run by enemies and mostly ignore them.  Bosses also suffer from the same problem.  There're 2-3 that are pretty tough and will probably kill you a time or two until you learn from your mistakes and win, but others are incomprehensibly easy.  The Pooh Sisters will barely put up a struggle and will probably only take down a fraction of your health before you slaughter them.  I beat both the final boss and his alternate form without dying once, and I arrived at the final boss with only about 40% of my total health.The game can get a touch repetitive as you'll be fighting most of the same enemies throughout with occasional palette swaps which grant them different health/damage/special abilities/weaknesses/etc.  Would've been nice to have more enemy variety, though enemies do use different weaponry (Rifles, Snipers, Shotguns, Rockets, Machine guns, etc) which do make fights feel different.You don't unlock the quick travel points until about 60-70% of the way through the game and the most that any one area will have is 1.  Some areas don't have any.  This can make backtracking for upgrades/pickups a little annoying later on when you've got all the special abilities.  Especially since some areas are relatively sizable and could take 5+ minutes to run through.  Most 'essential' stuff is usually somewhere close by where you find a new special ability.  It's usually only the unlockable art/intel/character info that are far off somewhere, so it'll only be really annoying for people trying to 100% the game.Graphics are fine, music is hit and miss but is decent enough for the most part.  Didn't run into any bugs/crashes at any point.  Most of the games problems are minor points, though I would have really liked the game to be much more challenging, especially the bosses.  It's a solid entertaining game.			"

The reboot, a really fun Metroidvania style game, is a great addition to my library. The game comes with a couple extra play modes other than the campaign if your into that stuff (I'm not). Combat is fast paced and the abilities are varied.Pros- Fast responsive combat- Skill based platforming feels rewarding- Extra costumes- Fun boss battlesCons- Some abilites are useless in combat and I only used for opening doors- Travel takes forever, wish they had a faster teleport ability to move around the world mapDefinitly pick this up if your into ninjas, platforming, or Metroidvania style gameplay.

												After almost 30 hours and getting all the Steam achievements, I'm satisfied with my pre-purchase at full price. I've played through almost every previous Strider game from the past many times. This includes the original Arcade (as well as the Genesis version), NES version (which I love), and Strider 2 arcade version (via PSX). The only one I haven't finished is Strider Returns on Genesis because that game was horrible.Many of the original elements of the game can be found here, but it's not a remake of any previous game. While the original arcade version was just 5 stages to blast through, this one is total Metroid-vania style with a complete new layout. Right from the beginning, you find places you know you will have to trek back to later.I think the music could have been a bit better. It's there and at times it can enhance the game play experience (i.e. remade NES Kazakh level), but it seems like it's more ambient at other times. It's definitely more of a modern style gaming music. This is probably just wishful thinking on my part. I totally did not like that Meio's song from the original Strider was not remade for this game. He also doesn't say ""All sons of old gods, die!"" while you're fighting him... His laugh isn't anywhere to be found either. I felt that was key to the original.The original familiars are there: eagle, panther, drones, but they're used differently than the original game. Once you achieve the ability to call them, they're only around for a short time. Instead of having 1-2 drones follow you around until you get hit, they're just like when you activate your super on Marvel vs Capcom. They spin around you and fire when you use your sword.The panther ""spirit"" appears and just runs back forth across the ground once, then disappears. The eagle just swoops through in front of you destroying almost everything in your path (I think it's more useful in this game than the original arcade).There are new power-ups not found in previous Strider games, and they're what separates/makes this game.There are new cypher powers not found in previous games. The only time you get a longsword power-up is when your meter is powered up enough after killing enough enemies consecutively. This meter also goes down over time or when you get hit, so it's not easy to build up. It would've been nice to get a longsword power up that lasts longer like the original arcade game.Would I recommend this game to Strider fans? YesWould I recommend this game to Metroid-vania fans? YesI give it an 8 out of 10.			"

												I did hear good things about this game but was a bit skeptic. In my view it looked so generic on those trailers, so I thought ""great, another generic looking 2.5D game to cash in on an old franchise"". I must now eat my words. Thoughts. Whatever.I only played two strider games, this and the one on Mega Drive. I never knew there were more until I recently googled it. So my review will occasionally compare this with the 'original' (well, it was a port of the original anyway so every time I say ""original"" I mean the Mega Drive port) and occasionally talk about the game as its own thing.I loved the original game. Never finished it, as it was usually the case back then. But what really stuck with me was how different everything in the game felt from every other game. The east european backgrounds, the level where you could only see silhouettes behind lightning strikes, the crazy gravity sections. The game never ceased to throw new things at me as I made my way through the levels. Today is common place for a game to have movie-like soundtrack, with those orchestral arrangements that follow no specific tempo (in movies they follow the whatever-is-happening-on-screen-tempo) but, to my memory, Strider seems to be one of the first games that did it, and I loved it.Why am I saying all this? because I think that feeling of playing a game filled with things I have never seen before was one of the defining features of the original and is the only thing missing from this reincarnation. Strider (now we are talking about the current game) doesn't take risks. It looks great but does nothing I haven't seen before. The few things that stand out it brings from the original, like the gravity mechanics, but not everything came and nothing ground-breaking was introduced. Granted, most of those features on the original are now commonplace and new Strider is in a tough position of showing newer things. But my point is that it doesn't take any risks in any aspect.However, while Strider sits in its own comfortable zone, it does everything extremely well. The game plays much like the original, your attack is as fast as you can mash the button without so much as slowing you down and you can climb walls and ceiling. Only a million times better than the original and with much more depth. There are so many maneuvers, different attacks, different enemies, that make battles extremely deep and incredibly satisfying. At first you just run through the enemies mashing the button, but as the game progresses you will find this strategy lacking. Shielded enemies will start appearing, flying enemies, enemies with different attack modules and so on. So each combination requires different strategies and fast thinking. By the end of the game I was jumping, dashing, changing weapon type in mid-air, activating powers, all within a second. The combat is, without question, the star of the game.The linear progression of levels was abandoned in favor of a metroidvania structure. And it definitely works. Metroidvania, open world, or any other kind of structure that has you backtracking all the time, works very well with action gameplay. It's also a well made map to explore and improve your character stats by finding upgrades. I think it was a nice addition, but the fact the combat is so good is determinant.One last thing. I thought the difficulty curve was ideal. I mention that because I read people complaining it's too easy. I did beat the last boss on my first try but that doesn't mean it was easy, I did it while standing up and shouting continuously at the screen until the ugly thing was dead. Very exciting stuff.			"

												This is a ""side-scrolling"" action game. Your character, Strider, is an assassin in a technologically advanced future dystopian world. There's an evil dictator in Kazhak and you have to assassinate him.Basically you run around the levels, slashing up bad guys with your high tech sword. Strider stats off as a fairly advanced side-scrolling melee action hero. He can run, jump, slide, climb walls (even hang ceilings), and slash enemies with this sword, you even get to charge up your super attack meter. You have a life meter so you can get hit a few times before dying. You also have a mana meter that autochages but you start without any mana or skill to use it.Killing enemies will grant you a little bit of life and mana and help charge your super attack meter. Getting hit takes away life and some of your charge meter. When your meter is fully charged, for  a short period of time, your attacks are more powerful and have extended range.As you explore the levels and progress through the story you earn power ups for Strider and his sword. He can learn new actions: double jump, dash, downward flying stab, throw daggers, deflect enemy shots, charge the sword, and summon mosnters to attack or for ""fast travel."" Summoning monsters to attack and throwing kunai use up mana.You also earns elemental upgrades for the sword: fire, ice, and magnetic charge. These elemental upgrades can also be applied to his charged sword attacks, throwing daggers (kunai), and dash attacks. You can choose which element to have active.There are also optional upgrades to find throughout the map. Extend life bar, extend mana bar, increase mana re-charge, and number of kunai thrown per use. These require a bit of backtracking. They are not necessary but very helpful to have.I played this on easy difficulty and found it to be an enjoyable experience.I highly recommend using a controller. I used an xbox 360 controller.			"

Fun and finely crafted remake that outshines its predecessor.Strider is a remake of a 1980s era action platformer.  By every measurable criteria, the modern Strider far surpasses its predecessor.  I was not a fan of the original and though it looked great, the action was clunky and overly challenging in spots, which were hallmarks of the time.The modern Strider, released in 2014 by Double Helix Games is a graphical delight and a blast to play.The combat is fast paced and represents gaming at its best.  Lower tier enemies are quickly dispatched and it is quite enjoyable to utilize your speed, mobility and ninja moves to savagely respond to a group of rifle toting cyborgs putting you under fire.  Bossess and larger enemies take some pattern recognition, which is reminiscent of the finest old-school gaming.Strider simply has the best platforming mechanics in gaming as well.  Double jumping, wall climbing and ceiling climbing have never been done better than this.  Jumps are fast, controllable and tight and climbing a wall is not a chore to accomplish.The game has leaderboards and is littered with hidden collectibles and unlockable options adding quite a bit of content and replayability.This remake was refreshing to see and Double Helix did a fantastic job here.  Though the game has top-notch graphics, they did not try to force 3D and perspective change to modernize the game as the Castlevania series regrettably did.  This is how you remake a game, by taking what was good about the original, do it better, focus on fun gameplay, improve and modernize the graphics and add in a ton of extra content.			"

												Ah Strider, what happened to you buddy?  You were my favorite genesis game, my number one pick for any Marvel vs. Capcom game (HUR DUR LETS PUT HIM IN MVC3: VERSION 25 1/2 A FEW MONTHS LATER).  You had style, you had soul.  You also didn't have Double Helix producing you and Capcom wasn't what it is today, but let's just chose to ignore that for now.  Hopefully this review will clear anything up for you if you are a Strider fan, but are worried about making this purchase. I took the nostalgia goggles off, and gave it a shot.You are Strider Hiryu, a ninja in the distant future that has a blade that slices through metals in a way that you and I would cut through a wet paper bag.  Top of your class and supposedly last of your clan, you set off to fight Meio, the mysterious overlord of Eurasia (who are we kidding, it’s just Russia).  That's what the Strider game was originally based off (I think) and that's what I'm sticking to.  Your gameplay includes slashing things at all times.  If there's a platform section in this game, keep slashing anyway.  Just a heads up if you are looking for something that requires a little more in-depth combat.  You aren't going to find it here, at least not a very deep level anyway.  What do you want?  Try playing the Gen and Arcade Strider game before you even think about getting this one and try that out.  That is what a Strider does.Did you play it yet?  Whatever you learned from the Gen/Arcade game, you can forget, except the slashing bit.  No longer do you get health bar increases, or blade extensions pick-ups; you must play the *metroidvania* game and hunt them down, piece by piece.  If there is an area that you can't get to, don't worry about it.  You'll probably fight a boss and get a power up to be able to explore that area in a bit.  Can't find out where you are going?  That's fine.  We'll hold your hand with our waypoint system so you can find your way there with little to no back tracking or challenge.  We'll lead you to all the important things in the game, but if you want collectibles, we're going to only show them as markers on the mini map.  No help after that!If you can't tell, this is a serious gripe for me.  If you are going to turn this game into a Metroidvania, then just do it.  Take the dive, remove all the safety gear, and give the players a decent challenge.  <------  If you are an original Strider fan, this is what you come to expect.  I understand there needs to be some types of flow in this game, but at least take away the hand holding.   Fine, give us the objective, but don't point us in the right direction.  It's a slap to the face.  You don't increase our play time or our enjoyment by doing this.  Strider games from the Gen and PSX were based off a linear path, and guess what?  It was a big enough challenge that it kept us coming for more.  That's what we like.Power ups and items come in two flavors; Health bar/energy bar and abilities.  I hope you didn't expect stats in this game (being a metroidvania and all), because there aren't any.  You can refill energy/health at ""Safety points"", off your enemies’ deaths, or through hovering capsules.  The blade mechanics don't change much (except for a charge swipe), and if you can slap people around enough without getting hit, you'll go into ""RED HULK CYPHER MODE"" for a few seconds.  It's not really that great, and trying to achieve this during regular combat doesn't really impact gameplay.  It’s a nice benchmark to know that you are moving quickly and not getting hit though.  That's not to say that Strider doesn't pose some challenge in fights.  Certain areas can get frustratingly overwhelming if you let it.  The problem is that after a few power ups, such as option a or b, this problem is eliminated.  Boss fights are.... disappointing, for a Strider game.  I expect more thought put into this area other than sound clips from the bosses while I ignore them and slash away.  ""NOT SO TOUGH NOW HUH STRIDER?""  I guess it would be cool if I could taunt back, but sadly, Double Helix cuts more corners than an Indy driver.  Boss patterns are predictable and easy.Keyboard and mouse controls were okay.  If you are going to attempt to play this on a keyboard, be forewarned; stopping or changing directions at times was awkward, but I believe this was more of a design flaw in the game than it was for the keyboard.  I found it easier to spam on a keyboard for slashing, but a bit more comfortable on a controller for extended play.   If you have a controller and going to make this a marathon, I'd suggest the controller.  Whatever floats your boat?Strider is a multiplatform game, so we get a ported version.  I didn't check the system specifications on this one, but when I did, I laughed.  Recommended 4 gigs of ram, a dual core processor, win 7 64 bit, DX11, and 4 gigs of hard drive space,  and a lower grade graphics card (GTS 720), which isn't terrible, but I have to wonder where the 4 GB came from to place on my hard drive.  I've noticed scaling issues attempting to go full screen at 1080p, and it does not seem to give the option for higher resolutions.  Keep this in mind; they did not port this well.  Expect to see some glitches and bugs.Sound is there.  We won't get to enjoy a decent soundtrack, but I suppose that’s what to expect when the company wastes most of the budget on getting voice actors for a Strider game.  Bad ones, at that, and a poor script to boot.  You'll hear the Strider theme every time you find something.  Expect nothing else.  You won't be surprised.  There are collectibles to find, and challenge missions to unlock.  There's some replay here, but I won't waste my time.  I do not see a point system yet, but if there's a total grade at the end of the game, I will of course update it.  Right now I'll just plod through this mediocrity, reminiscing of the Strider of old.  This game got too stale too fast.I'll give it a 5.7, which hurts my own feelings.  Decent grab, but get it on sale.  Some may enjoy it, but Strider fans of old games, you’ll finish it with a sense of disappointment.  The quality isn't there. *Those who aren't familiar with this term, it refers to Metroid  and Castlevania games that enjoy free roaming in a 2D setting, that progresses through different areas through the acquistion of items.*			"

												Strider is a 2d action platformer that has exploration and item collection much like other metroidvania-style games. I recommend playing with a controller. Fortunately for me I didn't run any into bugs, glitches or crashes while playing.You don't have to be familiar with the other titles in the Strider series to get into this one. This is a perfectly fine standalone title and the first one to have a seamless metroidvania-style of progression in it. It has 3 difficulty settings (I beat it on normal) and some difficult steam achievements. You play as the Strider, Hiryu, who has been sent on a mission to hunt down and assassinate Grandmaster Meio. It's not quite that simple though as many obstacles and diversions are put in your way. Meio lies inside of a tower, sealed by 3 Gravitron power cores you will need to destroy. As you go you'll find different powerups that will teach you new moves, increase your health and energy, unlock shortcuts and this game's version of elemental attacks to your main weapon, the Plasma Cypher. It's worth noting the elemental upgrades are a key mechanic to the game as they will allow you to defeat specifc enemies and open specific doors you'd otherwise have to ignore. It's really fun to play and see just how versatile Hiryu is. He can slide, jump, double jump, air dash, ground pound, climb up walls and across ceilings and reflect enemy bullets back at them. There's a lot more too as you get more Cypher (weapon) upgrades. The enemy variety is decent. Most times it's different difficulty variations and palette swaps of the same foot soldiers but it is done in a way that keeps it fresh as you go through this 6+ hour adrenaline fueled ride.The boss fights are where this game really shines. The mid to end game boss fights are challenging and will no doubt test your reflexes to their limits. Without going into spoilers, I will say there is enough unique variety of boss encounters to always keep you on your toes. Another high point is the world the game takes place in, each area is interconnected with areas you can backtrack to and unlock other secrets or create shortcuts as you progress and learn new abilities. You don't necessarily have to walk back on foot the whole way though, you get the ability to summon an eagle and a panther that will take you to other areas if you find the right tile to use them on. The map system is excellent, areas that are currently inaccessible will be marked as such so you can find it later when you have the right ability to get through it.The soundtrack is okay. Not bad but I wasn't impressed with it either. The voice acting isn't the worst but it is pretty bad. The sound effects themselves though were both crisp and fitting of the theme & technology found in the game. The biggest flaw I found, which may be considered a nitpick by some, is that when Hiryu climbs a wall and gets close to a ledge, he'll automatically pull himself up. Now that might sound like a good thing but there are some precision platforming puzzles where this is an absolute rage inducing annoyance and I've unintentionally pulled myself up right into an electrical grid or a laser beam more times than I'd like to count. Or when I'm trying to jump down onto a wall right below the ledge only to pull myself back up. The way Hiryu handles can feel a bit floaty too when you're trying to do some precision double jumping and air dashing for some of the harder end game areas. Aiming his cypher with the analog stick also doesn't feel 100% accurate.When all is said and done, I recommend this game. I had a blast and enjoyed the challenge it offered. I think Double Helix did a great job with this Strider reboot.			"

												Rating 8/10Overview: 2D action/platformerThe Good+ Great graphics+ A fun if not flaws metroidvania type game. As you play you acquire upgrades which can then be used to traverse further into the game. You can also backtrack to collect more upgrades. + A wide variety of boss battles which are fun and challenging  + Good controls and combat. Light and heavy attacks mixed in with 3 different types of magic. + Easy achievements The AverageThe overall level design itself can be a bit confusing and the method to traverse between areas can be cumbersome. The Bad- Voice Acting and dialogue are really bad- I got a lot of slowdowns despite very little happening in the game. - Frustrating encounters with enemies, you get knocked down over and over again with little chance of recovery. ConclusionA great 2D action platformer open world game. The overall level design is not as good as some of the best out there but this is still a great game to play if you are a fan of the genre. "

												A frenetic Metroidvania-style remake of the original arcade game, this 2014 retelling of an action classic pretty much nails it. Strider lets you know it's no B.S. from the instant you start playing, showcasing the addition of more refined controls and level design to the breakneck action of Strider 2. The result is hectic, satisfying combat, smooth controls, and a big map full of hidden goodies. Nailing those essential elemets would have sufficed, but gorgeous visuals and a fleshed-out story (complete with voice acting for all the dialogue) really ice the cake. Still, it's not so perfect a game that you can expect it to go down as a modern classic in its genre. It's hampered just slightly by the addition of too many combat mechanics that do little more than overcomplicate what should have been more straightforward hacking and slashing. And while there's a large world to explore, this game has the most convoluted map I've seen in a very long time, which makes exploration and secret hunting a massive headache. Nonetheless, Strider's a great addition to a great series, and the developer's proficiency in all areas of its design make it an overall success.			"

												This game is vastly superior to Bionic Commando Rearmed! Is it a good Metroid game? Yes. It has a decent amount of exploration, the graphics and music are also pretty good. Almost better than Other M. The negatives. The game has no lip sync. Production quality in the cut scenes/story is very low. Strider's movement is analog. This game is a port from the 360. that's why they went that route. The most negative thing I have to say is this game would be far better with dpad movement. I died a few times because of analog. If you like Metroid style games, but more action, less exploration, this is the game to get. Whatever game journalist that gave this game a bad review should be Kunai'ed. It's worth a buy!			"

												Great remake of the old arcade game, that excells both visually and technically. It's pretty fast paced, however the battles you will encounter are balanced; even if you can't shoot, your blade is more than adequate. Especially, beating large foes and bosses with it feels greatly rewarding.  Also, there is a slight ""metroidvania"" feel in the air (acquire ability x to open door y) which removes linearity a bit and adds to the gameplay. Recommended!			"

												Strider was always a favorite of mine, dating back from the Nintendo Entertainment System, Arcade, Sega Genesis days and PlayStation 2, with the exception of Strider 2. No, not this Strider 2, this Strider 2 aka Strider Returns, a non-Capcom Strider…. man that game was so bad, but anyway. So I was pretty excited when Capcom and Double Helix announced that they were going to create a new game in the Strider series.Systems: PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox OneRelease Date: February 18, 2014 for PS3 & PS4. February 18, 2014 for PC, Xbox 360 & Xbox One.Developer: Double HelixPublisher: CapcomPrice: $14.99*Reviewed on the PC version of the game and final code*First and foremost this is not a remake of the original Strider but a completely new adventure that infuses elements from games such as Castlevania and Metriod (Hence the game being labeled as a Metroidvania game) and as such certain areas will require some back tracking if you want to find and explore every bit of the game. The combat is fast paced and fun with plenty of enemies and bosses to slay, all which have their own charm though their attack patterns are very easy to pick out.Thankfully the game adds more control freedom to the character this time around as you are able to aim your attacks in multiple directions using the analog pad, useful for snagging that out of place health kit or enemy. They’ve even given Hiryu several additional attack moves such as a down-ward thrust that allows you to take out both enemies and floors below you, a charged up Cypher which is handy for breaking down shielded enemies and adds  an attack bonus to your normal attacks. Even Strider Hiryu’s trademarked jump makes a return intact with no changes what so ever. I will add however that there is an issue on the PC side of things and while the game does support gamepads, it only natively supports either PC controllers (Logitech, Matcatz) or Xbox 360 controllers. If  you plan on using either a Playstation 3 or 4 controler with an emulation app like Xbox360ce or Motionjoy then be warned it may not work as there have been numerous reports of it not working with the title.Graphically the game looks beautiful, the art direction gives of a futurist vibe while the game moves along at a smooth 60 frames per second on the PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, however only at 30 frames per second on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. While the game is bright and has a cartoon-ish look to it, it doesn’t take away anything from the game and I’m sure that you’ll stop from time to time to notice the detail that was put into the game.  Luckily I purchased the game on PC and got to enjoy the 60 FPS along side my 2560×1440 resolution and damn does it look good (Not that I’m bragging). On the music front those who have played the Strider games of old’e will be right at home as there are plenty of remixes of classic Strider tracks as well as new ones. As an added bonus those who preordered the game on Steam were treated to a digital release of the soundtrack which contains 20 tracks  that includes 7 remixed versions of music from the past. Sadly the only other way to access the Strider soundtrack was to purchase the Limited Edition of Strider dubbed the “Strider Hiryu Special-A Class Limited Edition”  which is only for the PlayStation 3 and a Japanese only release but does include a 3 disc release of the soundtrack among other things. So if that sounds like something you may want, you better get to importing.While many fans of the series were unsure if Double Helix could do the Strider name justice, it’s reassuring to see that not only did they do the game justice but this is perhaps the best version of Strider to date, easily trumping it’s past iterations. If there are any negative things to say about the game is that it’s too short. Many gamers will finish the game well within 3-4 hours if they’re going for a straight finish, though if you’re one to unlock every secret and achievement then you can easily double that. Sadly once the game is beaten there is no new game+ mode, which isn’t a huge issue but it’s one of those nice to have things. Currently there isn’t any news about any upcoming DLC and with the acquisition of Double Helix by Amazon not much is known about the status of anything going.Even still for $14.99 you can’t go wrong especially in an age where even $60 dollar games are just as short,  Strider heralds back to the hey days of the side scrolling platformers and makes for an enjoyable experience for both new-comers and veterans alike. You can’t go wrong either way.  To those looking forward to getting the PC version of the game, there are two issues to be aware of other than the controller emulation issue that I mentioned above. The first is there is no way to map the buttons in-game which is totally unacceptable but at the same time we need to realize that this is a port of the PlayStation 4 & Xbox One versions. Though it is possible to bind the controls by editing the binds_pc.cfg file. The other is that this is a DirectX 11 title, meaning if you want this for the PC and you are either running a 32-bit OS and / or your video card doesn’t support DirectX 11 then you’re better off getting this for the consoles as this won’t run for you. Please keep this in mind since trying to get your money back on a digital only release isn’t going to be easy or fun. Hopefully this isn’t the last that we’ll see of Strider Hiryu and we’ll get another update of the classical Capcom ninja and sooner than later.			"

												The developers behind this 2014 remake/reboot of the Capcom arcade classic really got the balance right. They paid respect to the gameplay qualities that made the original fun, while carefully modernizing it with new elements which really elevate experience.The gameplay starts off *very* simple, letting you learn the basics, and then slowly adds new moves, attacks and special powers as the game progresses. The difference between the complexity of the combat in the beginning and in the end is REALLY dramatic. That's a double edged sword, because on one hand it helps keep things fresh and  interesting, but I can see how it could make someone toss the game aside after 20 minutes because he/she felt the gameplay lacked depth.The control scheme is really excellent using an xbox 360 controller, but in the midst of heavy action I sometimes experienced some problems getting the dpad to select the desired plasma type. Probably just my overworked, uncoordinated old fingers, but it did annoy somewhat.The graphics are pretty much perfect. They nailed the whole sci-fi ninja theme, and the 2.5d rendering dynamically zooms in/out depending on the area you're in, so that it feels confined and in-your-face when fighting in narrow corridors, and vast and open when you're outside in big areas.The sound effects are also excellent, but I found the voice acting (there isn't much) and music just a tad above mediocre.The game lasted me around 10 hours on ""normal"". 90% of it was an absolute joy, but the last 10% was sadly tainted with frustration due to a combination of high difficulty, my low skill level and some stupid game design decisions:- Checkpoints aren't save games! You have to reach a ""save pod"" to save your progress to disk. It blows my mind that someone felt the need to punish the user for having to turn off the computer!- Some checkpoints are placed too far before boss fights (of which most are great btw), making you replay a dull, unchallenging part of the map over and over. - No ""retry from checkpoint"" option.- Unskippable cutscenes before boss fights (well, you CAN after watching the first 15 seconds or so, but when boiling with rage after dying 15 times this feels like half an hour).At it's best, Strider 2014 brought me stellar gameplay moments, and while I do reckon this is in my top 3 action platformer games, there's no denying that the above complaints poisoned my overall enthusiasm somewhat.82%			"

												The last time we saw a full release Strider game was the good but frustratingly short Strider 2 for the Playstation 13 years ago. Most of us remember the NES version or the Genesis title very fondly, and interestingly this game is an amalgamation of the ideas presented in those two titles. With no small amount of modesty and admitted bias I have to say (and hope to describe why) it's absolutely brilliant and has completely surpassed my expecatations.  This is the way you welcome back the most bad♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ninja in history!The Good:- Metroid-in-a-tunnel sort of progression (until you unlock certain powerups that let you properly backtrack) while staying true to the arcade & genesis sort of fast action platforming gameplay.  You're encouraged to explore in a forward direction and there's always action to keep you engaged, and it's a really nice mix unique to this style of game.  You'll also encounter areas you can't access that you'll have to come back for (or not).  Anecdotally, I love these types of games, and it's nice to have another solid title in the catalog.-Controls are solid This assumes you're using an XBox 360 or XINPUT controller; I wouldn't recommend playing this game with a keyboard.  Hiryu is fast, easy to control, and very responsive with a nice selection of gadgets and moves. Gameplay, even combat, focuses heavily on skill and movement which are Hiryu's greatest characteristics, and the focus controls place on these aspects add a big layer of immersion to the game.- Level design is very well done, and progression feels natural.  You're given plenty of opportunity to leap, dive, and smash your way through levels that are as much vertical as they are horizontal.  Platforming is enhanced by the upgrade system.  You have a marker and a map that points you in the right direction, but hidden upgrades absolutely encourage you to explore every inch of the map.-Combat is visceral, flashy and satisfying.  As with previous versions, Hiryu attacks as quickly as you can press the button.  Normally you'd think a character that can literally move to any part of the screen almost instantly and attack as frequently as you want would feel broken, and while Hiryu feels insanely powerful, there are appreciably challenging portions of combat throughout the game.  Some of the bosses have some interesting mechanics and can catch you offguard if you get too nonchalant. It's a nice balance of feeling powerful while being challenging. -The overall aesthetic of the game feels genuine, and  I feel like this is the most important pro on this list.  Almost all of the game's music consists of remixes of songs used in previous games.  Many of Hiryu's signature moves, including the hard slash ""gram"" and launcher from Capcom vs. Marvel along with his robotic options and companions return and are incorporated well.  Hiryu and really all  character design looks great; bosses are interesting.  The art style is well done and fits the IP; all of the levels have a futuristic tech-look to them which fits well with our 2000+ year old ninja's style.  -The upgrade system is great.  Upgrades come frequently and they do a respectable job at making you feel more powerful.  This includes cypher upgrades all the way to health increases (think energy tanks from Metroid).  It makes you want to keep hunting to find out what you'll get next, though you don't have to find them all if you don't want to.  I think this game would be heaven for a speedrunner.-Game seems solid technically and looks beautiful.  I'm playing this on a mid range i5 3570k with an HD 6800; a very mid-range setup, and I've got the game maxed out at a constant 60 frames with no stutter.  I haven't encountered any bugs or crashes during my first playthrough (at last boss now).  The art direction really shines; the game looks striking.  Backgrounds are well done, effects look good with attacks lighting up the screen and defeated robots raining debris.  Again, this enhances the fast gameplay.The bad:-A few annoying technical details including characters who speak without moving their lips and pixelated textures when you're shown certain characters close-up are mildly distracting and look a bit silly.  You'll likely notice them right away and it will nag at you a bit, but it's not a huge deal for most of the game.-Story is barebones.  I'm not taking marks off for this at all honestly, but if someone actually reads this it's quite possible this will matter.  I haven't really gone over much of the extra content but in-game you aren't really given much to go on as far as why Hiryu's fighting, who he's fighting, or given much of a sense of urgency at all.  I think even Super Metroid set the stage a little better than this game did, and it was even more bereft of characterization.  Honestly though, if you're like me and you just want to destroy robots as the best ninja around, you shouldn't notice too much.-Unlocks aren't as exciting as you want them to be.  When I say ""unlocks,"" I'm talking specifically about concept art collections and new costumes for Hiryu, NOT the upgrades you get in game that affect gameplay.  The costumes are nothing more than pallet swaps, which is terribly lame in my opinion considering Hiryu actually has had some different threads in the past.  It would've been cool to have something like Strider Hien's (from Strider 2) costume as well.  A small bit of a missed opportunity in my opinion.-Controlls aren't apparently great if you aren't using an XINPUT control.  I would go ahead and discourage anyone from playing this if you don't have a controller you can use.  I'm using the wired Logitech F310 and it's perfect; I can imagine it would not be so great without one. -Gameplay does have it's nuances.  Hiryu can attack in 8 directions, and sometimes this will make it hard to hit certain enemies.  Some fights encourage you to spam attacks which can make it hard to focus on what's going on.  Certain fights have ambiguous mechanics that can be frustrating while others may feel too straightforward and uninteresting.  Some powerups (I'm looking at you option A) when combined with Hunter mode are pretty broken.  Things like this may turn off certain players.  Personally I feel like these sorts of things come with the territory in a game like this and add to the character.Other things I didn't touch on are the survival and beacon run modes you unlock through playing.  The main story on Normal difficulty should take you 7-9 hours of gametime, which in my opinion is a good length for this type of game.To wrap up this review (which is much longer than I intended), I just want to reinforce how surprised and pleased I was with this game.  I grew up playing the NES Strider to death (still love it) and I have to say that if I were going to make an update of that game it would very closely resemble what this is.  For my money, this is easily the most value packed $15.00 you can spend on Steam right now.  Worth every penny and very strongly recommended.			"

												Ah, another Metroidvania game. Strider is a fine game that knows perfectly well how the Metroidvania system works. As you may have guessed Strider does this with success. If you're unfamiliar with the term, please look it up.Except for a few difficulty spikes Strider is well balanced. Battles hardly become frustrating (one of the boss fights made me furious, though). Checkpoints aren't always set up in the best of ways, however. Restarting certain checkpoints may trigger an unskippable cutscene. Which is fine if you died a first time, but if you're having one of those difficulty spikes it quickly becomes infuriating. I'm referring to one of my boss fights later in the game here.The graphics are beautiful, with plenty of detail and color. The environments aren't always the most interesting, but thankfully there are plenty of secrets and upgrades to be found, making them a bit more interesting than if there weren't any.The voice acting is solid, even if the main character has a higher voice than expected. I expected him to have a deeper voice. But that's nitpicking. It's something most of us gamers won't notice. I have nothing but good things to say about the music and sounds otherwise, even if the music isn't always my main priority if we're talking about sounds.Strider isn't particularly long, only 5-6 hours. But if you want to collect all the upgrades you can add a few hours here. Despite the game not being extremely long it's enjoyable all the way through and I think anyone can finish it.I had a good time with it at least and I would certainly recommend this game to others.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												This incarnation of Strider is a Metroidvania-style game with it's focus on hack n' slash platforming. The music is decent, the action is solid, and the controls are sharp (an absolute requirement for this sort of title). The voice acting is so-so but that isn't what you're really here for, is it? Sorta wish they'd have kept the original cipher sounds, but ultimately I don't mind the update. Total gameplay time is around 6 hours. There's an achievement for finishing in less than 4. A controller is definitely recommended for this title. For: Strider series fans, people that like slicing things to bits, anybody who thinks cyber-ninjas are the future, action and platforming fans.Not for: The easily frustrated, people who hate backtracking for pickups, people who hate 2d platforming.

												The game is unbelievably good and completely captures the spirit of ALL of the originals, including the obscure NES one. Runs flawlessly with perfect performance on midrange DX11 hardware. In fact, I am playing it in native 4K maxed out at a locked 60 FPS with my midrange 2016 hardware! BUY IT NOW. Especially if you like fast 2D action sidescrollers (like Megaman X) and ESPECIALLY if you liked Strider or Strider 2. Hell, even if you just know Hiryu from Marvel Vs Capcom you should probably buy this game immediately (do try the original two however - just a word of caution: Skip Strider Returns and make sure you play the Arcade or Playstation versions of the original two titles).

												Mark of the Ninja makes you feel like a ninja by having you sneak around, cool and calculated. Strider makes you feel like a ninja by throwing you into huge firefights armed with only a sword and reflexes. You also have an inexplicable glowy laser scarf. GLOWY NEON COLORS EVERYWHERE. So pretty.The default difficulty level is kind of high; I recommend playing on easy. You can attack as fast as you can mash the attack button, and higher difficulties just up the HP of enemies.			"

												Strider is a great metroidvania-style game - the pacing is good, the bosses are fun and the environments are varied. All that said, I don't know what Double Helix did with this version of the game, but it crashes nonstop. I've tried it on two PCs, one an i7-4790k with a GTX 1070 and the other an i5-6500 and GTX 970. Both are more than capable of running this game, yet at random points it will just crash inexplicably. It's doesn't seem to be tied to what's going on in the game at the moment, and it can be really frustrating to have the game lock up before you reach a save point. If you can tolerate the crashes, there's a good game here. But there's plenty of great games in this genre that take quality control a little more seriously.			"

												I have great things to say about the new Strider; although I've not played the older games, this Strider is an excellent game in its own right and I have nothing but adoration for it.The game throws you straight into the fray right away; you'll be able to dive right into the fast-paced slicing-and-dicing as soon as you start up the game. Did I mention that the controls are ridiculously smooth? Although Strider is not a particularly difficult game, combat is rewarding and satisfying.The game is visually stunning, especially for a game as cheap as this. I found myself often just staring at the cityscape background, just soaking in the details. However, it can be a little jarring watching NPC's talk, however; their mouths don't exactly move...The soundtrack is great and fun to listen to while you slash robots and other minions to pieces. The voice acting can be a little cheesy, however; one particular character's voice--Professor Schlange--will make you want to dig your eardrums out. Regardless, I'm merely nitpicking. Overall, Strider is a ridiculously fun game for its price, and doubly worth the investment. "

												Dans ce jeu éponyme vous controlez un personnage mélange de ninja et samuraï, dans un univers cyber-futuriste en 2D.Strider est un savant mélange entre action et plateforme, très inspiré du genre ""metroidvania"". Les niveaux sont liés les uns et autres au sein de la grande carte d'une ville, et petit à petit l'on acquiert des pouvoirs permettant de débloquer notre progression vers les divers boss et la fin du jeu.On saluera l'identité graphique respectée et remise au goût du jour, ainsi que les mécaniques de gameplay et la bande son (l'utilisation d'un gamepad est fortement conseillée).On reprochera une absence de challenge en dehors du plus haut mode de difficulté, et des chutes de FPS dans certains environnements.A recommander aux amateurs du genre, en promotion de préférence :)			"

												I'm just gonna say it.  This game is boring.  It looks nice, the controls are mostly good (except when you want to jump off a wall then it gets a bit mind bendy), the sound is ok but everything is dull, really dull.First, the story.  What frigging story?  I have no idea what is going on, nothing is explained about who I am why I dropped into the ""eastern-european-psuedo-stalinist-but-really-it's-japanesey"" city of can't remember the name.  What is my purpose?  The game tells me to go to A then B then C but why?  You get these bizarre cut scenes that tell you nothing and make things more confusing, who are ""the winds"", when did I♥♥♥♥♥♥on their birthday cake because I don't remember why they are desperate to slice me up.But I think this is supposed to be an arcadey type game so let's move onto... combat.  Again this is so dull it's difficult to know where to start.  Enemies fall into 3 main camps that I've seen so far.  Aerial and annoying, on the ground and annoying and on the ground and sometimes annoying.  Strider, for reasons not adequately explained, decided to bring a short sword to a gun fight and so you spend all your time trying to get to the enemies which are usually dispatched in one or two hits.  Most of the enemies you just literally slice in half, sometimes you get one with a shield which means you have to use the charge attack and then slice them in half.  That's some innovation folks.  You then get the bosses or mini-bosses or whatever they are.  These are just enemies with limited attacks with more health.  Learn/dodge the attack and they are defeated.  No challenge or skill required.The final point of desperate boredom is the exploration.  Remember how in Super Metroid you had a feeling of achievement when you worked out how to get up the wall and into the small hole to get the new weapon?  Or how you remembered you could now go back to an area and explore beyond the unpassable door or wall?  There is none of that here.  You just feel like a rat being led through a maze.  The collectibles are pointless, yay I got new intel on something and yay I got more health that I didn't really need because enemies drop health and there seems to be a giant health rat wandering around pooping out endless health packs (seriously there are hundreds of the things all over the place).Overall the problem with Strider is that it's trying to be lots of things and failing at all of them.  It's trying to a fast moving hack-n-slash platformer but the enemies are like marshmallows and the platforming is dull.  It's trying to be a Metroidvania but the exploration is pointless and without real rewards and you are led around on a leash (there is a ""how far you have to go to your destination distance ticker under the mini map).  It's trying to be an old school arcade game with next generation gameplay with a veneer of seriousness but there is no skill challenge, you don't have to be creative when fighting enemies or be skillful in the platforming, at times it tries to evoke Super Meat Boy but you can cling to walls so where's the challenge?  Trouble is having never played the original Strider I don't have any nostalgia goggles available to help me brush over what is a rather boring game.			"

												 Overall I thought Strider was a good spin on the classic game. Turning it into a Metroidvania style open world game with secrets and plenty of worthwhile backtracking was a smart move. I did find the environments repetitious and lacking in variety. This hampered my desire to explore and as such I finished the game at only 75% completion when I usually shoot for 100%. The boss battles were the highlight though they also could bring some frustration if you aren't good at memorizing attack patterns as there is usually little to no way to heal in these encounters.

Fast combat with tight controls, a very interesting and visually appealing style with a dystopian soviet-style metropolis and a love letter to fans of old school gamers and especially Strider Fans. There are some parts of the game that could have been more polished (some frustrating enemy encounters from time to time and for a Metroidvania game, the travel between places can be a little cumbersome and could have been designed better and some times it could use more variety - the setting could provide for more originality in some places) but if I keep going this review will end up into nitpicking. Besides no game is perfect.For its price I think it's a game worth your time if you like this genre. Nothing mindblowing but not shabby at all! I enjoyed it.			"

												Contrary to popular belief Capcom does in fact have IPs besides Street Fighter and Resident Evil,  This is one of them.  It harkens back to Strider's Action Arcade roots but uses the Metroidvania game design to expand on it.  Solid Platforming, Tight Controls, very Atmospheric and humorous Saturday Morning Cartoon-esque dialogue.  It has two minor problems in that with too many projectiles and enemies on the screen at once the game may chug and the FPS may drop. the other problem is that some areas rely on copy-pasting rooms to increase the longevity.

You can go around the map to get extra items like max hp boosts but you'll end up with 8/10 of every item like that just playing the game with only minimal backtracking and exploration.I do not recall getting much of a story at the beginning of the game that explained why you're fighting.  Basically the story is ""they bad guys, you ninja.""The gameplay is where this game shines and, what can I say, it's a Strider game.  There are only two times in the game that feel especially cheap to me, both of which took an extra 5 minutes to get through.If you want a 4.5 hour, no-story, high-quality-gameplay 2-d platformer with some decent boss fights then give this game a go.

												Balanced proudly on the back of a galloping jaguar of pure energy, cybernetic ninja Strider Hiryu has returned at long last!  With holographic scarf streaming in his wake, he blazes through the laser-sculpted city of Kazakh, his objective:  to end the life of demigod despot Emperor Meio, and release mankind from his soul-crushing grip!  Strider Hiryu has always been a majestic character, but it is only in this game that he finally seems himself, sprinting, sliding, blasting and slashing with an elegance and speed his original creators could only have dreamed of, and his older games could only suggest.  Raucous applause to Double Helix for bringing out the best in this iconic hero!  Now let's have a sequel that takes its primary inspiration from the fascinating but fatally flawed NES iteration!  We can have Hiryu and friends hanging out in a giant unicorn-shaped space station, teleporting at will to a variety of evil-infested locations around the globe -- and this time Double Helix can make good on the promise of that 8-bit tragedy!

												PUT SAVE POINTS AFTER PRE-BOSS CUTSCENES, NOT BEFOREThat's my main criticism, although that's not all I have to say. This is my first Metroidvania game (if you don't count Terraria - sort of), and I guess I was expecting a bit more. The curve of mobility upgrades could have been a bit more developed, and the combat seems to take up more of the focus. That's not really bad, but I feel like I was expecting something different. Also, back on the subject of saves, they're way too far apart here. Iteration time is NOT a hard concept. Even better, put in quicksaves, which no one ever has ever objected to.For what it is, the game is very good. The animations are nice, I love the art style, and the combat is entertaining, and can bear being repeated several billion times as you try to defeat the boss fight right after the current room because there's no save between room and boss (seriously, this is elementary stuff). I was just expecting something different. On the bright side, however, this has made me even more excited for such games as Super Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I think this is a genre I can really get into.P.S. I bought this game purely on Yahtzee's recommendation. He represents it well, and everyone should watch Zero Punctuation.			"

												Quick summary: Strider is a side scrolling hack/slash platformer game, like playing Mega Man with a sword. The game uses modern particle graphics and is overall a fun (but challenging) way to spend about 9 hours. You play Strider Hiryuu, a kind of futuristic ninja fighting against the forces of Grandmaster Meio, who rules the city with an iron fist (+ magic powers). Your fellow striders have fallen in battle, and you can find their remains occasionally as you wander the areas of the game. Finding a fallen strider gives you a new skin (just a different color suit). Grandmaster Meio isn’t your only problem though, he has an army of henchmen, cyber troops, and bosses for you to battle before you even see him. As mentioned before, the game is a two dimensional side scroller and you will spend most of your time double jumping, climbing walls, and boosting around with your plasma catapult (a kind of air dash). Since there is no money or exp to pick up, you can actually run or jump past most of the enemies in the game. That’s why the game has an achievement for completion in under 4 hours. I took 10 hours my first run through since I tried to grab all the upgrades around the game world. Strider has a world map similar to Super Metroid, where you can see most of the upgrades on the map as soon as you get close enough, and you’ll constantly be encountering doors that you can’t open until later in the game with the appropriate weapon. Almost all of the fighting is done with your trusty sword “cypher” that can be upgraded with special effects like fire, ice, and bullet reflection later in the game. You also have special attacks like throwing kunai, and “summoning” support, but your sword will deal with 95% of your enemies.Pros:+The game is challenging (especially some bosses) but there’s no penalty for dying so you can try out a bunch of different ways to tackle enemies. Be aware though, that some bosses have an unskippable dialogue scenes so if you keep dying and restarting boss fights you’ll get annoyed with their long-windedness.+You can cling to almost any surface and with double jump + plasma catapult there’s all sorts of nooks and crannies to explore in the city. A lot of upgrades can be found this way.Cons:-Not much of a story, but the game is pretty casual (not the difficulty) so it’s not that big a deal. You’re probably playing for the ninja action anyway.-Some of the gameplay elements aren’t explained very well.  I didn’t understand until about halfway through the game how the energy system worked or what the “combo meter” did. Neither of these things are critical to winning (at first), but a short tutorial would have been helpful.Overall, Strider is fun and just challenging enough that you’ll find yourself respawning a few times at the bosses.  If the regular enemies become too repetitive, you can just run and jump past them. You should probably play this game with a controller though I used keyboard (no mouse input). The reason I used the keyboard is that you mash on the attack button a lot, which I don’t like to do on my controller.  "

												To start it off, I enjoyed this game. In the beginning, I felt it was fairly bland, but it slowly turned into something much better. I initially felt this way due to simply being able to go through the metroidvania-like map by dashing forward and pressing one button to go through enemies. While it was like this for the first 90 minutes or so, it became much more challenging. The enemies changed from being one dimensional and the bosses were actually challenging. They weren't impossible to beat, but it did require that you face them 2-3 times and learn their attack patterns. This game has much more to offer than what I experienced/was willing to do, but that's generally the type of gamer I am. I prefer to play for the story instead of trying to unlock every single little thing. There are unlockables scattered all over the map, but I pretty much just went after the power/energy upgrades instead of actively searching for hidden content. Overall, this is a fun game and I recommend it. 3.5/5			"

												Fun ""metroid-vania"" style of game where you play a cyberpunk ninja. The story is fairly unremarkable, but serves it's purpose of carrying you through various zones and boss encounters. Level design is pretty solid, and each area is full of skirmishes with mooks, hidden secrets, and secrets that are obvious but require items that are obtained later in the game. Enemies can be threatening and require use of a decent amount of combat techniques learned throughout the game. There are definitely some overpowered weapons available to use, but they are optional items, so they may not be encountered without some searching around the level. The blade-changing mechanic is well-implemented, and there were never situations where I felt like I needed to rapidly switch back and forth between various powers. Boss fights are the highlight of the game, ranging from reflex-testing fights to bullet-hell dodging and positioning tests.			"

												I wasn't sure if I would like this or not, but the more I played it the more I liked it! Very Metroid-esque, but with a ninja, which is amazing. I really enjoyed the arc from the beginning to the end of the game, with the amount of extra talents/attacks you get. It is immensely satisfying taking down an entire army of shielded and/or flying bad guys in a matter of seconds without being hit, when at the beginning of the game it would've been near impossible to do it at all.

												Finally Beat the Game. It was really good. It's how a reboot should be done. It feels like a combination of Metroid except you have a sword instead of an arm cannon. I dont remember the other games being like that, but it's a welcome change with a more metroid-vania style level design. It had a few challenging/frustrating parts but overall 9/10.			"

												I unlocked a new abillity: double jump. Which on my first try, glitched me through a wall, causing me to fall through the world. And that did not even kill me. There is nothing Strider can't do.10/10 would dubble jump again.			"

												A brisk, kinetic action-adventure (or metroidvania, if you’re down with that), which puts the player in the role of invincible cyberninja Strider Hiryu. At the time of its release, this type of game wasn’t quite as abundant as it is now, but the standard formula was set in stone: explore the world (smacking baddies as you go), find new items, and use these to explore further. Strider is comfort gaming in that it does nothing to shake up the formula, but is pleasant to look at and play, and is over before it outstays its welcome.I used a gamepad to play, and it worked well. Hiryu, with his flowing scarf and permanent crouching dash, is a real treat to control. He’s always fast and agile, and fans of the series will be pleased to hear that his cartwheeling jump is present and has been perfectly realised. The movement and animation is smooth, but I found that Hiryu would cling a bit too readily to walls and ceiling, and his movement when in this clinging state is significantly slowed. It’s hardly a deal breaker but I did feel it wasn’t as slickly executed as the other running and jumping. It would be remiss of me not to mention that you can’t bind movement to the d-pad, which will probably be a deal breaker for some players.Unlike some games of it’s type, there isn’t much menu hopping in Strider, so you’re free to roam and fight. A creature of habit, Hiryu uses only one weapon, a kind of laser sword, and he’s so comfortable with it it's like an extension of his body. Hammering the light attack will produce a series of very quick attacks, and holding it will charge up for a big horizontal swing. This can stagger the game's weaker enemies, and - BONUS! - it makes a wicked slicey sound. You can do launcher attack as well, but I rarely used it as you can’t launch larger enemies for air-juggling, and the weaker ones go down quickly enough with basic swings. This isn’t a game where you’ll have to memorise combo attacks, which makes it more accessible but also means the combat has little depth. The iconic appearance of the sword and the sound it makes means it feels great to use, and at the start of the game I was cackling with glee as I tore through entire regiments of robot enemies, but as the large mech enemies began to appear at the end of the game, and even footsoldiers started to carry shields, I longed for a bit more variety in my means of attack. At that point your tactics basically come down hit the bad guy in his unguarded back, which works in almost every instance.Some variety comes in the form of unlockable kunai which can be thrown to pepper weak flying enemies or hit far switches, but they don’t have any of the punch of the sword and can’t be thrown often enough to be much use in a heated fight. In addition to these, you’ll find different modes which affect the sword and kunai, for example an icy blue one which can freeze enemies solid, useful for both traversal (frozen enemies are platforms) and combat. You can switch to any state with a single button push, so can vary things up as much as you like without getting bogged down in menus. Lastly, Hiryu can collect three “Options”, powerful tools which can seriously damage bosses, but which are limited in use by an energy meter. I, ahem, always forgot to use them, but they’re there and they work fine.My biggest complaint about Strider is that it’s short and fairly samey throughout, definitely a more linear kind of metroidvania. You explore one large city, Kazakh, themed around a soviet dictatorship. Although you’ll travel through a prison, an army base, and an underground lab (oh, and a sewer for some dumb reason) each area looks pretty similar to the last. I didn’t get lost much in Strider, but that’s not because I’ve got a great sense of direction or was able to navigate by landmarks, but simply because most areas aren’t very big and don’t allow for much in the way of diversion. If you go down the wrong track, more often than not you’ll find a “secret” pickup, usually a piece of concept art, and then you’ll have to double back and go the other way. The map is actually pretty good, but you won’t often use it.The story, such as it is, isn’t worth mentioning. These guys are baddies, and Hiryu has to stop them, simple as that. There’s a smattering of cool bosses in here, but also some weak and forgettable ones. None of them really tested me as a player, and honestly I breezed through the game on the standard difficulty. But, I’m not complaining: I tend not to finish a lot of games these days, so it was nice to play one which gave me just what I was expecting, and didn’t throw up any big roadblocks.With good controls and animation, okay combat, and so-so level design, Strider doesn’t quite do enough to really stand out from the pack, but if you’re looking for a quick, bombastic adventure, you’d be remiss not to at least give it a try.

												This game rocks. it's a good old Metroidvania styled gameplay with a twist. Run around, explore a huge open world with kick♥♥♥♥♥powerups. slice some dudes up, dodge bullets, destroy giant cyborgs. it's REALLY fun. Very responsive controls. What I personally love about this is that there is no delay before you can swing your sword again, meaning that a guy like me, who can mash a button pretty damn fast, had TONS of fun mashing the ♥♥♥♥ out of the attack button at ridiculous speeds. there's no damage reduction for this, though unfortunately, a well placed charged beam is safer and does more damage, on top of paralysing bigger foes after 3 hits....*cough* Anyway, the aesthetics are great, the environments look pretty damn awesome. The music is sweet, too!on the downside, the characters don't even have lipsync. the voice acting is kinda crap too, imo.I highly recommend a controller for this. also, if you're the least bit experienced in games, I recommend trying it on hard. I REALLY enjoyed this game, it might be a bit on the short side, but I'd say it's well worth it. I give it 7/Potato			"

												So what is this? I'd put in the vein of Bionic Commando: Rearmed. It's a solid reboot of the franchise, telling the 'original story' in a new style, with a slightly redesigned Strider Hiiryu, feeling very familiar control wise. The graphics and gameplay delivers. I'd certainly recommend a gamepad for this one, as it simply didn't... FEEL right with the keyboard. It sounds good, plays well, it's a BIG game, and it has an almost Metroid like feel of exploration and discovery and unlocking!Gripes? Hiiryu /looks/ like he's moving fast but he feels... Sluggish. Sure you can spam that cypher like the blue bloody blazes, yet overall, it still feels 'paced'. And not for nothing? But I'd like to set him from 'Norma' to 'Turbo', otherwise he feels like this semi-sluggish speed demon being chained up by gum on his boots. Not the speedy quick sumnabeach we all knew from MvC.All in all? Great game. Grab it. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Short version: Strider is a 2D platformer with Metroidvania qualities, priced at $15.  Beautiful visuals, heart-pumping soundtrack, simplistic storyline but a richly detailed world, can be completed in 6-10 hours. I recommend you play this with a controller, and that you have the specs to run it well. Buy it.Long version: I had never heard of the Strider series until recently. I watched a series of YouTube videos explaining its origins, its evolution, and the clones it inspired. I then became quite interested in Strider, and decided to buy this reboot by Double Helix (makers of Killer Instinct). I have not regretted my purchase after a 12 hour playthrough, and I plan to 100% it in another playthrough.In Strider, you play as Strider Hiryu, the last and best S-class Strider (ninja assassin). He is tasked with eliminating Grandmaster Meio, the ruler of a dystopian future Earth. That's the plot.As stated before, Strider is a 2D platformer with Metroidvania elements. Your primary weapon is Hiryu's signature cypher, which he can swing as fast as you can mash the attack button. Throughout the game, you upgrade what your cypher can do, navigational movements for Hiryu, and ""Options"", magic abilities. As well as assist in defeating enemies, these abilities can open pathways previously inaccessible, leading to secrets such as concept art and background information about the story and characters. Strider is riddled with challenging boss fights, each one is satisfying. All the bosses have complex attacks, but they're easy to learn and once you learn them, you feel great. (Can't speak for everyone)Strider is a great game for both old-school fans of the series and newcomers that want a badass experience. I strongly recommend dropping the $15 on this gem of a game.			"

												The original Strider was released way back in the 80s, and supposedly it was very popular. And then, aside from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knockoff and a single mediocre sequel in 2000, everyone forgot about it. Until Hiryu, the protagonist, was included in UMvC3. Riding on the resurgence of popularity, this game (2014 Strider) is released. Disclaimer: I have never played any previous Strider games, but this one is very fun. The combat is not very complex but it is enjoyable all the same. It definitely feels satisfying to cut through the hordes of enemies you come across, and the ability to control your slash direction gives you options to engage them. 2014 Strider is a BEAUTIFUL game, and the colors and flashiness add to the exciting experience. Many of the animations are homages to the original game. The exploration is also well done. Due to the fact that Hiryu can climb on 99% of the surfaces in the game, secrets can often be found in unexpected places. The levels are built, however, so that searching for said secrets never feels too tedious. Similar to games like Metroid, the entire game takes place in a single world  and so backtracking is essential to unlock everything. Overall 9/10, even though I've never played the original it's very obvious the developer is fond of the metroidvania games of the 80s and this reboot is very well executed.			"

												Fantastic - probably the best Metroidvania-revival game I've played next to Guacamelee. Control is fluid, the music remixes are great, and the power-ups varied. Sure, you got your staples like the double-jump, but you also get some interesting ones beyond that, like a knife-throw attack that can be endowed with elemental attributes. My only real gripe is that the boss battles manage the rare feat of being too easy, but also feeling very cheap - you will take damage from some apparently unavoidable attacks, but they do so little damage there's no real incentive to try to learn to avoid them. I also wish the objectives were presented a little more creatively than having your AI computer thing just tell you where to go. Finally, it's lacking some of the zaniness of the original Strider - sure its got a mecha-gorilla callback, but where's the stuff like the Politburo transforming into an armored dragon? Or a dinosaur popping out of nowhere? Or some even crazier original ideas?If you enjoy Metroidvanias, you owe it to yourself to play this.			"

												Few hours into the game, its very similar to the older stirders, only with a emphasis on exploration, removing the liniear, segragated stage format. Strider also has a bevy of new attacks and abilities, and the boss fights are varied and fun. tons of power ups and bonus content such as concept art and data files for story elements are scattered aroudn the stages. Animation is smooth and the pace of the game is very quick, despite the emphasis on exploration (which is ultimately optional, but rewarding). It's worth noting that the game gradually unlocks new abilities for the player as they progress. The world of strider is also fleshed out in more detail compared to the previous games, Meio's capital city is run in a very totalitarian fashion, and there are some great throwbacks to works that featured similar governments. anyone recall a certain ""ministry of truth""? well, one of the areas in the game is called ""ministry of propoganda"" which got a chuckle out of me. any strider fans owes it to themselves to give the game a shot. if there's a minus to the game, its that I had trouble getting a controller to work on it properly. ""full controller support"" is misleading.			"

												Time Played: ~9 hours (according to the timer in-game)Purchase Price: $1 - humble bundle ftw!Verdict: Yes yes please more of this, yes.I bought this game as part of a humble bundle a few weeks ago, and I had played the previous versions of this game (including the original on the NES when it came out)...  so maybe I'm a bit biased, but this game is pretty much everything I want from a platformer.  Period.  Pros:Lots of sprawling areas to explore, and return to once you have more mobilityFast paced action game, lots of enemies, always stuff going on.Boss fights were entertaining, though a couple were pretty frustrating (of course, what platformer is complete without the boss or jumping puzzle that keeps you banging your head)Well designed levels, decent replayability.Cons:I couldn't stop playing once I started ;) (I seriously blew a good chunk of this weekend playing)You can't go back to the rest of the game once you enter the last board.  I am thus stuck at 92.8% complete (I swear I thought I'd gone and gotten all the unlocks, but I missed one.  LET ME GO BACK WITHOUT STARTING OVER!)Switching plasma mid-fight does not feel very fluid.  On some fights I'd have to go blue, yellow, purple, and I lost a lot of health doing that.  maybe having one of the two kunai buttons as a ""next plasma"" might have been better...  maybe it's just that I am really terrible at remembering which direction is which plasma, or something...  or I'm bad at using my left thumb on the controller?  Not sure.Unplayed portions:I'm still missing quite a few achievements, I'll possibly come back to get those later.I haven't played any of the challenge modes.  I will have to take a look at those to see how they go.  I've unlocked them all (I'm a collector so I've gone through and done them all)Haven't tried a 4 hour speed run yet.haven't played on Hard yet (played through on normal)Other:Even though I paid $1 for this game, I would easily have spent 10 or 15 on it, because the quality was fantastic.  If you're on the fence, I vote you go for it.  if you hate it, you can always ask for a refund, but I think it's totally worth the investment.			"

												All sons of old Gods...DIE!!The return / reboot of Strider!This reboot borrows heavily from both the NES and Arcade versions of the game, fusing all the great aspects of both but also changing the layout of the entire game drastically for a brand new experience. Grandmaster Meio is the main villain so no worries for arcade purists. This is a true reboot and does not segway in to Strider 2 on the PSX or have any connection to any other Strider games previously released. The lore has been changed from Strider Hien's backstory to prove this.The soundtrack is pretty decent, the newer songs aren't so great, they're more like ambient noises, however the old school remixed tracks are amazingly well done. The remixed tunes span across nearly every re-imaging of the game from the coin-op version, the turbo CD, NES and even a track from Strider 2. ;)The gameplay is fast and frantic and once all of your abilities are unlocked you feel as if you can handle any situation and truly feel like an A-Class Strider. It can become a bit cumbersome while climbing around on ceilings but wall climbing is pretty solid. Boss battles are fairly frequent and require some heavy memorization and skill if you plan to make it through on the Hard setting. Plenty of stuff to do and numerous reasons to re-play the game, speed running, 100% completion and of course becoming an A-Class Strider by conquering hard mode. Definitely worth the price for any Strider fan, new or old.			"

Here we have Strider, a cybernetic ninja hero out to save the day but has nothing to say.  The plot is kind of vague, but it seems to be that he's come to a people's democratic republic of tyranny kind of country with an assignment to kill someone.With eye-popping graphics, intuitive controls, fast-paced gameplay, and sheer badassery, you can't go wrong with Strider.

												The map is horrible when it comes to navigating your way around the inter-connected levels.Explosive Kunai can cheese 99% of the bosses and enemies with no problems at all.Strider is totally amazing, and well worth the full fifteen dollars. If it's on sale, you'd be an idiot not to pick it up if you enjoy this style of game.It's a Metroidvania-Lite, if that makes sense. Combat is melee heavy, and lightning fast, while keeping tight and responsive controls. While you can do some exploring and back tracking to find hidden POW symbols (which unlock concept art, lore, or bonus modes such as survival challenges), or upgrades to add to your health and such, doing so is rather tedious given the horrible game map. The map is split up into sections that it wants to send you down in a linear fashion. Rather than showing you the full thing at once such as in Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night. You can unlock a type of fast travel, but the fast travel points don't tell you what they connect to, or show you a logical route around the city.Aside from that complaint, I really don't have anything bad to say. The music is amazing, and is a perfect mix of new and retro, blending in some of the classic tracks from the NES version of the game, while not over powering the soundtrack with chiptune nonsense. The voice acting is over the top, to play to the B-Movie vibe the story and world has, and fits great. The boss fights are the main attraction, and there are many of them. Each one is memorable, and unique. Often your reward for defeating a boss is an upgrade, such as a new ability, or a new beam type... I mean, a new plasma type for your blade.The game shouldn't take more than five hours or so if you just go through it without much exploring, and veteran action gamers will want to play on hard mode. The game is generous with checkpoints and stations that refill your life, so you won't be set back very far if you die.I should note that I have managed to climb into the walls of the map at one point. At first I thought I had found a hidden area, but that wasn't the case. I was stuck, and had to reload my game.On that note, it can only have one single player game saved at once, which is a big problem if you share your computer or want to have a run going on normal and hard at the same time.While I hope some patches address the minor issues it has, I really can't recommend this game enough if you enjoy things like Super Metroid, Guacamelee, and Symphony of the Night.edit: I thought of a few more complaints I had but it's nothing big. It's annoying that once you get a new plasma type for your sword, which act as keys for certain types of doors, that you have to switch the blade type to open the door. I wish I could just attack it and have it open. It's a tedious step that doesn't really need to be there. Granted, it's super fast and easy to change types (D-pad) but if I'm fighting guys and using the ice sword, I don't want to have to change to gravity sword just to open a door. Also, the sword swings as fast as you hit the button, except for the gravity sword. That shoots out a little projectile that loops around when you attack, and you can only have two out at once. If you have two out, you can't attack at all. It should let me swing my sword, just not shoot out another thing. It makes using it feel like a liability rather than something I would want to do.That being said, I feel like I have been exploring my♥♥♥♥♥off, and the maps still show my item collection at like 80% or so for most of them. That's pretty cool.			"

												TO KEEP IT SIMPLE: Do you like Metroid, but don't want to play Metroid, because you've already 100%'d all the games 5 million times? Then here you go, a new Metroid game. Buy it now.To those who don't know: A typical Metroid game typically boils down to exploring a semi-open world, defeating bosses in each area. As you progress through the game you'll obtain upgrades and powerups allowing you to access more areas of the world as well as approach combat in different ways. It's a simple progressive formula that almost any action/adventure game uses now days, but few have pulled off as masterfully as the Metroid series has.The main difference between Strider and Metroid is the combat. While Metroid tends to have combat here and there, combat in Strider is plentiful, yet easy to avoid if you don't want to bother with it. Basic combat boils down to mash attack until the enemy dies, maybe use a robot companion if you want extra damage. The tricky part is that you die VERY quickly, particularly on higher difficulties. Meaning you can't just stand there and mash attack, you need to be evasive. This creates a scene where you're flipping through the air, bouncing off walls, sliding past enemies; all while attacking. As a result, despite how basic the combat is, it turns out to be pretty fun. This is taken to the extreme late game when you're thrown into rooms with 10+ guys with different weapons and set ups; where standing still for just one moment means you're dead.			"

												I cannot recommend Strider at this time.  There are numerous major bugs with controls, graphics and resolution-swithching. The game won't run full-screen at all on my system (a modern PC with an nVidia 760 GPU), and the system requirements are absurdly high for a simple platform game.  64-bit and Direct X 11? For what? There are no features in this game that require anything close to that level of tech.If, like me, you leapt before you looked, there is some hope. Checkout the ""Borderless Gaming"" group here on Steam for a solution to the resolution issues. It solved most of my problems, and borrowing a controller from my Xbox 360 fixed the controls.			"

												Quoting another review, Strider makes you feel AWESOME!Where else can you throw shurikens and slice up enemies while you are cartwheeling around bullets and missiles launched against you?The movement and the different attacks are extremely repsonsive and they are a joy to use. It is rare to see a core design executed so well.I only had two minor problems:1. Traversing the levels can be problematic if you are trying to collect every collectible because levels have different entry and exit points. The game would have benefited from a teleport system, or at least, labels on the map that clearly say where these exits lead to.2. Some of the enemy's attacks can knock Hiryu down which I understand to some degree but it also can be flow-breaking and frustrating as well. Who knows, maybe I wasn't playing too well, because often I wouldn't be able to dodge these attacks. :)Overall, if you want frenetic and responsive action that lasts for 6-8 hours, then look no further.

												JUST STWIDEW MANG. I beat it on Hard Mode. Couldn’t help but proceed straight to writing something about it. It’s a very well made game and deserves some credits.Out of habits though, I’ll mention some of its drawbacks first.- While most of the combat controls are very intuitive and gratifying, Strider’s main slash attacks don’t really feel as good as they could be. First off, this might be a personal preference thing but, it’s because you’re slashing metal most of the time, instead of anything soft and vulnerable like say, flesh, the sound effect returned is usually that of a clash between hard objects, and it can be kinda jarring. But that’s understandable because of the setting of the game. Secondly, Strider’s slash attacks sync perfectly with the player’s input, in that Strider just swings back and forth at one direction and there’s no pattern or sequence of swings in many other action games (imagine like, horizontal swing, then uppercut, then somersault, etc). While that’s not necessarily bad for something with this much platforming integrated into combats, it just doesn’t feel as good. There’s a joy in executing sequences of attacks in combats and knowing that they worked. Imagine you have 5 consecutive swings in each attack sequence, and hey that guy has only a little health left, so the first 2 swings will target him, and the last 3 will target the other guy with more health, and then at the end of the sequence the 2 enemies die. And you feel good. Stuff like that. But in Strider you just mash your buttons as repeatedly and as fast as possible. Again, not a bad thing. Just doesn’t feel as good.- This is a bit of an irony, but I was pretty happy at the start of the game because it absolutely did not dump a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of baby-step tutorials on me, and I had a bit of time to learn and try out the basic controls before the real action. While a guide for every time you gain a new ability is required and doesn’t hurt, I completely failed to understand why the game feels the need to remind me of what buttons to press every time I get near anything of interests. And it kinda disappointed me. Like when you reach a thin bridge, a pointer that says “Press LB + Down to pass through” shows up in the middle of the screen and you’re like ??? You respected me as a smart person at the beginning of the game, and then now I’m a baby again who needs constant reminders on what buttons to press? I don’t get the philosophy in this one honestly.That’s the only issues I have with the game, I think. Now onto the good stuff.- A good and consistent sense of progress. Strider does not dump a buttload of mechanics on you and expect you to master them all right away. You start out with very stripped down and basic controls. And even mechanics as simple as the sliding tackle have to wait until the game is sure that you’ve had a fair amount of time to familiarize yourself with the mechanics you have so far. Furthermore, the introductions of new mechanics are spread evenly throughout the game, so it’s simply not possible for you to collect all abilities early. When you’ve collected the last piece, you’re pretty much at the final boss. So you always have something to look forward to from start to end. Unlike in some games (coughFF8cough)- Good approach in handling backtracking. Sort of relevant to the previous point. The game is full of temporarily inaccessible rooms that require later-acquired abilities to unlock. Since as a part of the “plot”, you have to backtrack a whole lot through the same few areas throughout the game, those previously inaccessible rooms help a lot in keeping the players motivated to backtrack.- A decent upward difficulty curve. The first part of the game was really smooth and easy, even on Hard mode, in that you just need to charge at enemies head-on and chop them into pieces since the amount of health killing enemies gave you could offset for what you lost most of the time anyway. So I thought it was a really easy game and was going to stay the same from start to end. But the difficulty actually picked up a lot later on, albeit the curve is a little too steep at some points. But most importantly, about 60-70% of the game requires you to actually learn the patterns in several sections and try out different strategies, with each combining many mechanics together and not just charging relentlessly at enemies. I do think that’s a nice touch for an action platformer.- The damn game is just outright cheesy. Overpowered random guy, aka the chosen one Strider, check. Big♥♥♥♥♥kanji on protagonist’s shirt, check. Straightforward good vs. evil story, check. Brief and cheesy dialogue between characters, check. I know this game is a remake of a very very old game that came out when ninja was a very big part of the media culture, but still, it’s lovely to see something cheesy like this coming out to the modern gaming era today. People need cheesy things sometimes. Not everything has to be super clever and about conspiracies to be enjoyable. In fact, I like games that are honest about what they really are despite being simple and straightforward, rather than those that hope to fool the players with fancy fillers.Overall, totally a must have if you're one of those who enjoy the cheesiness of the classic video games back in the 90s. The price of the game is pretty fair for what it offers as well.			"

Posted: April 7, 2014
												TL;DR If you like Strider series/Metroidvania games/good reboots get this.Strider 2014 expands the ""Strider subgenre"" into metroidvania style platforming.Gameplay is largely the same as in the arcade Strider and Strider 2, with the biggest difference being the addition of being able to slash in multiple directions. This alone adds a huge amount of creativity to combat, with the player being able to jump around and slide under enemies and slash at leisure. The combat has also becomes more Metroid-like with the addition of Plasma types, which function in very different ways in combat. Gameplay upgrades don't feel superflous like a lot of other games in this style *cough30grenadepackswheeze*, the kunai upgrades are well worth seeking out, catapault upgrades not so much. Options have pretty much the same function as in the Marvel vs Capom series, it feels so great using Ouroboros for the first time. Strider has a dedicated launcher, which is great for creating fun combos, but it only works on the normal mook enemies which is a shame because it'd be really fun to launch other enemies or even small bosses. Lots of bosses with a lot of work put into each of them, you likely won't see all of their attacks unless you play on hard mode.Difficulties are pretty diverse, Easy and Normal aren't too difficult, lots of health pickups and save points should you trip up when you aren't shredding through enemies. Hard mode however brings the difficulty more in line with the arcade titles by increasing the amount of damage done to Strider, increasing boss health, and lowering the amount of health you get from pickups, even the canisters. Speaking of health pickups, you don't automatically get health and energy back when you hit them, instead they burst into little particles which fly to your hud, then you get restored, can be an issue at times. When Strider's on low health there's this annoying red flicker effect that appears on the top and bottom of the screen, which you know what, not the worst trend that Strider could have picked up from modern games at the time, could be worse.There is one new gameplay feature that I really have a problem with and that is Burst Mode, which activates whenever Strider does enough damage in a period of time. This to me feels more like a crutch against bosses and doesn't add a lot to the game. Strider's a very mashy genre, but even this is ridiculous.The novelty of Strider becoming a metroidvania pays off in spades when you realize that running, climbing, and ninja jumping around a level is exactly the kind of stuff that lends itself well to running around a big map collecting upgrades. The map is fairly big too, thankfully no elevators are used to get from place to place, instead performed by the Eagle and Panther Options. Some routes throughout the map are one-way though, which can be a little troublesome if you're looking to collect everything. Doesn't seem to be much room for sequence breaking outside of glitches and the Solo Skip. The enviornments are also varied as well though obviously not as much as previous games, just like Shadow Complex there's a lot of work into contextualizing locations.Much of the soundtrack is remixes of past Strider themes. However because of the multitude of sfx in the game a lot of tracks can often sound like ambience ingame, with only a few tracks that really stand out such as Coup. Coup is awesome, always listen to Coup, otherwise keep the music level high and the sfx level at half or so. Voice acting's eh, most of the original characters you won't pay attention to but the usual Strider characters do fine, Strider Hiryu and Solo in particular sound awesome. Artstyle holds up, character designs not as iconic as the MvC era ANIME Strider. 3D models do present an issue where they look fine from a distance but up close in cutscenes not so much, Strider Hiryu's hair especially. Enviornments look great, lots of weather and bloom surface effects in the background.HOW-EV-ER, the graphics were the source of my discontent with my first playthrough. Double Helix it is nice to know that between this and Killer Instinct you clearly love adding on lots of fancy effects to the game, but having to pay the price by my framerate literally being cut in half is not a great thing. For whatever reason this also carried over to cutscenes where audio will clearly finish faster than the cutscene itself and you'll just have 5 seconds of a character gesturing silently. Double Helix in the future please consider putting more extensive graphics editing options into future releases. Double-check your computer's graphics capabilities before getting this on steam, else you seriously risk your enjoyment by having the game slow down to the point where it will take you 10 real world hours to progress 4 in game hours.Played on a MadCatz SF4 SE Arcade Stick. Only issues were due to plasma switching being mapped to DPAD. Camera in gallery mode is mapped to right joystick.The Strider series has been through a lot of troubles but hopefully Strider's UMvC3 appearance and this game mean the series still has a future. Not sure if DoubleHelix will be making another, maybe Iron Galaxy? They seem to be handling Killer Instinct pretty okay.I just want a Strider with the artstyle of 2 and the gameplay of 2014. Is that too much to ask? Now if we could only get a Cannon-Dancer reboot...			"

												my metascore is 95. Capcom gave Strider a much needed modern twist  of a old character and it definitely delivered beyond expected. This makes up for a new megaman game any day. It reminds me of Orson Scott Card's Shadow Complex 2.5d platformer but better. Kudos to making another one.			"

												HEYDO YOU WANT TO BE A SWEET TECHNINJA ON A MISSION TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM A DUDE WITH A LOT OF ROBOT MINIONS, CONTROL OF A HUGE DYSTOPIAN SCI-FI CITY, AND A SPOOKY GOD COMPLEX?THEN YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME BECAUSE YOU NOT ONLY PLAY AS THAT GUY, BUT YOU KINDA FEEL LIKE THAT GUY WHEN YOU PLAY, TOO.Capslock because this game is so cool and fun. Story's nothing new, but gameplay is a blast--think Metroid with a little more guiding, and a lot more absurd sword cipher weapon thing and acrobatic ninja shenanigans. The aesthetics and sound are top-notch; the voice-acting is over-the-top in a way totally appropriate for this game. Lots of stuff to find and collect: power ups and nifty concept art and alternate color palettes for Strider Hiryu.Great game. My only gripe: when I first found the ice plasma for the cipher, it felt like a real step down after getting to play with the flame plasma. Even with the kunai and dash upgrades, it wasn't as fun to use as any of the others.Hoping this game does well enough that Capcom puts some more thought into dusting off some of their franchises and doing something with them.

												Finally Capcom hit the spot with a remake! Awesome game, really!Pros: very responsive controls, strategic gameplay, awesome soundtrack, story and art assets from the extras. Difficulty seems pretty fit; hard enough to give veteran platform gamers some trouble but not impossible for newcomers. Last but definitely not least... IT'S JUST FREAKING HIRYU!!Cons: It just could've resembled a bit more like the classic Arcade/Genesis game, in both the game world (Kazakh City is awesome, but I miss the Polar base and the Jungle; also the Balrog feels rather small when I compare it to the classic games; same for the Grandmaster's Fortress) and the soundtrack.Overall, I'd give this game a rating of 4.5 out of 5 Stars.

												Despite my all the fond memories I have of the NES Strider (8-year-old me's favorite game), and of bugging my parents to stop in the Trapper's Alley arcade whenever we were in Greektown just because they were the only place in town that had the coin-op version, I had really low expectations for this game.  Wow, was I wrong.  Double Helix really pulled off an impressive feat with mixing just the right amonts of several flavors of old with new.  The Metroidvania structure draws more on Metroid Fusion than the globe hopping NES game, which means you always have a very clear bearing to navigate the map toward, and veering from that path or backtracking to previously unjumpable gaps or impassable doors is primarily only for finding health upgrades or collectables.  Combat might initially feel a little sloppy, but after grabbing a couple power-ups, it can feel almost Alien Soldier-esque, especially during the frequently demanding boss fights.  And, of course, there's a ton of fun call backs to the old games.  Considering rad everything else is, I have no problem overlooking that Hiryu has some kind of surgerical mask now rather than the bandito bandana and that the new tunes aren't very exciting,			"

												JUST STWIDEW MANG. I beat it on Hard Mode. Couldn’t help but proceed straight to writing something about it. It’s a very well made game and deserves some credits.Out of habits though, I’ll mention some of its drawbacks first.- While most of the combat controls are very intuitive and gratifying, Strider’s main slash attacks don’t really feel as good as they could be. First off, this might be a personal preference thing but, it’s because you’re slashing metal most of the time, instead of anything soft and vulnerable like say, flesh, the sound effect returned is usually that of a clash between hard objects, and it can be kinda jarring. But that’s understandable because of the setting of the game. Secondly, Strider’s slash attacks sync perfectly with the player’s input, in that Strider just swings back and forth at one direction and there’s no pattern or sequence of swings in many other action games (imagine like, horizontal swing, then uppercut, then somersault, etc). While that’s not necessarily bad for something with this much platforming integrated into combats, it just doesn’t feel as good. There’s a joy in executing sequences of attacks in combats and knowing that they worked. Imagine you have 5 consecutive swings in each attack sequence, and hey that guy has only a little health left, so the first 2 swings will target him, and the last 3 will target the other guy with more health, and then at the end of the sequence the 2 enemies die. And you feel good. Stuff like that. But in Strider you just mash your buttons as repeatedly and as fast as possible. Again, not a bad thing. Just doesn’t feel as good.- This is a bit of an irony, but I was pretty happy at the start of the game because it absolutely did not dump a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of baby-step tutorials on me, and I had a bit of time to learn and try out the basic controls before the real action. While a guide for every time you gain a new ability is required and doesn’t hurt, I completely failed to understand why the game feels the need to remind me of what buttons to press every time I get near anything of interests. And it kinda disappointed me. Like when you reach a thin bridge, a pointer that says “Press LB + Down to pass through” shows up in the middle of the screen and you’re like ??? You respected me as a smart person at the beginning of the game, and then now I’m a baby again who needs constant reminders on what buttons to press? I don’t get the philosophy in this one honestly.That’s the only issues I have with the game, I think. Now onto the good stuff.- A good and consistent sense of progress. Strider does not dump a buttload of mechanics on you and expect you to master them all right away. You start out with very stripped down and basic controls. And even mechanics as simple as the sliding tackle have to wait until the game is sure that you’ve had a fair amount of time to familiarize yourself with the mechanics you have so far. Furthermore, the introductions of new mechanics are spread evenly throughout the game, so it’s simply not possible for you to collect all abilities early. When you’ve collected the last piece, you’re pretty much at the final boss. So you always have something to look forward to from start to end. Unlike in some games (coughFF8cough)- Good approach in handling backtracking. Sort of relevant to the previous point. The game is full of temporarily inaccessible rooms that require later-acquired abilities to unlock. Since as a part of the “plot”, you have to backtrack a whole lot through the same few areas throughout the game, those previously inaccessible rooms help a lot in keeping the players motivated to backtrack.- A decent upward difficulty curve. The first part of the game was really smooth and easy, even on Hard mode, in that you just need to charge at enemies head-on and chop them into pieces since the amount of health killing enemies gave you could offset for what you lost most of the time anyway. So I thought it was a really easy game and was going to stay the same from start to end. But the difficulty actually picked up a lot later on, albeit the curve is a little too steep at some points. But most importantly, about 60-70% of the game requires you to actually learn the patterns in several sections and try out different strategies, with each combining many mechanics together and not just charging relentlessly at enemies. I do think that’s a nice touch for an action platformer.- The damn game is just outright cheesy. Overpowered random guy, aka the chosen one Strider, check. Big♥♥♥♥♥kanji on protagonist’s shirt, check. Straightforward good vs. evil story, check. Brief and cheesy dialogue between characters, check. I know this game is a remake of a very very old game that came out when ninja was a very big part of the media culture, but still, it’s lovely to see something cheesy like this coming out to the modern gaming era today. People need cheesy things sometimes. Not everything has to be super clever and about conspiracies to be enjoyable. In fact, I like games that are honest about what they really are despite being simple and straightforward, rather than those that hope to fool the players with fancy fillers.Overall, totally a must have if you're one of those who enjoy the cheesiness of the classic video games back in the 90s. The price of the game is pretty fair for what it offers as well.			"

												TL;DR If you like Strider series/Metroidvania games/good reboots get this.Strider 2014 expands the ""Strider subgenre"" into metroidvania style platforming.Gameplay is largely the same as in the arcade Strider and Strider 2, with the biggest difference being the addition of being able to slash in multiple directions. This alone adds a huge amount of creativity to combat, with the player being able to jump around and slide under enemies and slash at leisure. The combat has also becomes more Metroid-like with the addition of Plasma types, which function in very different ways in combat. Gameplay upgrades don't feel superflous like a lot of other games in this style *cough30grenadepackswheeze*, the kunai upgrades are well worth seeking out, catapault upgrades not so much. Options have pretty much the same function as in the Marvel vs Capom series, it feels so great using Ouroboros for the first time. Strider has a dedicated launcher, which is great for creating fun combos, but it only works on the normal mook enemies which is a shame because it'd be really fun to launch other enemies or even small bosses. Lots of bosses with a lot of work put into each of them, you likely won't see all of their attacks unless you play on hard mode.Difficulties are pretty diverse, Easy and Normal aren't too difficult, lots of health pickups and save points should you trip up when you aren't shredding through enemies. Hard mode however brings the difficulty more in line with the arcade titles by increasing the amount of damage done to Strider, increasing boss health, and lowering the amount of health you get from pickups, even the canisters. Speaking of health pickups, you don't automatically get health and energy back when you hit them, instead they burst into little particles which fly to your hud, then you get restored, can be an issue at times. When Strider's on low health there's this annoying red flicker effect that appears on the top and bottom of the screen, which you know what, not the worst trend that Strider could have picked up from modern games at the time, could be worse.There is one new gameplay feature that I really have a problem with and that is Burst Mode, which activates whenever Strider does enough damage in a period of time. This to me feels more like a crutch against bosses and doesn't add a lot to the game. Strider's a very mashy genre, but even this is ridiculous.The novelty of Strider becoming a metroidvania pays off in spades when you realize that running, climbing, and ninja jumping around a level is exactly the kind of stuff that lends itself well to running around a big map collecting upgrades. The map is fairly big too, thankfully no elevators are used to get from place to place, instead performed by the Eagle and Panther Options. Some routes throughout the map are one-way though, which can be a little troublesome if you're looking to collect everything. Doesn't seem to be much room for sequence breaking outside of glitches and the Solo Skip. The enviornments are also varied as well though obviously not as much as previous games, just like Shadow Complex there's a lot of work into contextualizing locations.Much of the soundtrack is remixes of past Strider themes. However because of the multitude of sfx in the game a lot of tracks can often sound like ambience ingame, with only a few tracks that really stand out such as Coup. Coup is awesome, always listen to Coup, otherwise keep the music level high and the sfx level at half or so. Voice acting's eh, most of the original characters you won't pay attention to but the usual Strider characters do fine, Strider Hiryu and Solo in particular sound awesome. Artstyle holds up, character designs not as iconic as the MvC era ANIME Strider. 3D models do present an issue where they look fine from a distance but up close in cutscenes not so much, Strider Hiryu's hair especially. Enviornments look great, lots of weather and bloom surface effects in the background.HOW-EV-ER, the graphics were the source of my discontent with my first playthrough. Double Helix it is nice to know that between this and Killer Instinct you clearly love adding on lots of fancy effects to the game, but having to pay the price by my framerate literally being cut in half is not a great thing. For whatever reason this also carried over to cutscenes where audio will clearly finish faster than the cutscene itself and you'll just have 5 seconds of a character gesturing silently. Double Helix in the future please consider putting more extensive graphics editing options into future releases. Double-check your computer's graphics capabilities before getting this on steam, else you seriously risk your enjoyment by having the game slow down to the point where it will take you 10 real world hours to progress 4 in game hours.Played on a MadCatz SF4 SE Arcade Stick. Only issues were due to plasma switching being mapped to DPAD. Camera in gallery mode is mapped to right joystick.The Strider series has been through a lot of troubles but hopefully Strider's UMvC3 appearance and this game mean the series still has a future. Not sure if DoubleHelix will be making another, maybe Iron Galaxy? They seem to be handling Killer Instinct pretty okay.I just want a Strider with the artstyle of 2 and the gameplay of 2014. Is that too much to ask? Now if we could only get a Cannon-Dancer reboot...			"

												Very fast paced melee metroidvania similar to Shadow Complex. If you follow the radar, the game is generally very linear, but there's lots of side paths to explore if you want every upgrade. The abilities you earn through the game and some of the set pieces are really surprising and fun. Great boss fights... some are pretty difficult, but with concentration and practice feel fair. The writing and voice acting are terrible (sort of like a bad GI Joe cartoon), but it doesn't really matter and for the most part can be ignored.			"

												If you're a fan of 90s action platformers you will probably love this.  It goes fairly quickly, especially if you don't run around collecting all the items once you get the required Metroidvania progression items, but it's pretty much all high notes.  There are a few annoying fights, most notably the ones involving shifting gravity (your movement keys are constantly shifting in an awful design decision), but it wouldn't really be a 90s action platformer without annoying boss fights, now would it?

												a sexy looking, fast paced and tight action platformer that stays true to the original, whilst doing its own thing.straight off the bat: this game looks and sounds sweet, there is almost nothign wrong with the sound and visuals (minus the explosion effects at times looking like early stage work).the platforming is tight and responsive (as it should be) and the combat is fast, responsive and fun (as it should be since you back track a bit for collectibles and story related things).story takes a back seat, but i didnt really ind since the action and platforming an collectible hunting where all top notch and fun.collectibles where actually worth looking for (they arent all that hard to find in all honesty) as they reward you with concept art and 3d renders of characters (that you can read about and rotate to see the details on them).i did however throw in the towel at the final boss since he got a little too crazy for my eyes (he telports and talks alot and spams lots of annoying energy things that are a pain since it goes against the fast pace of the rest of the game and makes you sit and wait to atack him).def worth checking out if you love action platformers (or liked the original). worth full price :)			"

												my metascore is 95. Capcom gave Strider a much needed modern twist  of a old character and it definitely delivered beyond expected. This makes up for a new megaman game any day. It reminds me of Orson Scott Card's Shadow Complex 2.5d platformer but better. Kudos to making another one.			"

												HEYDO YOU WANT TO BE A SWEET TECHNINJA ON A MISSION TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM A DUDE WITH A LOT OF ROBOT MINIONS, CONTROL OF A HUGE DYSTOPIAN SCI-FI CITY, AND A SPOOKY GOD COMPLEX?THEN YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME BECAUSE YOU NOT ONLY PLAY AS THAT GUY, BUT YOU KINDA FEEL LIKE THAT GUY WHEN YOU PLAY, TOO.Capslock because this game is so cool and fun. Story's nothing new, but gameplay is a blast--think Metroid with a little more guiding, and a lot more absurd sword cipher weapon thing and acrobatic ninja shenanigans. The aesthetics and sound are top-notch; the voice-acting is over-the-top in a way totally appropriate for this game. Lots of stuff to find and collect: power ups and nifty concept art and alternate color palettes for Strider Hiryu.Great game. My only gripe: when I first found the ice plasma for the cipher, it felt like a real step down after getting to play with the flame plasma. Even with the kunai and dash upgrades, it wasn't as fun to use as any of the others.Hoping this game does well enough that Capcom puts some more thought into dusting off some of their franchises and doing something with them.

												Five hours in: in a nutshell •	The good, it’s really fun to play for a few min to an hour or so. The story is fine, jump puzzles and enemy swarms get interesting.•	Expected some great Strider 8bit music, nope, it’s awful. Personal preference, open music and play some Anamanaguchi or Rymdreglage. Anything is better than the OST.•	Could not play on a 60 hz 720 TV without blackout patches, needed to play it on a monitor & it looks great. Wanted to sit on the couch with a gamepad but the desk and pad are fine.•	The voice acting is attempted but nothing spectacular.•	There are dialogue popups that make tracking enemies, projectiles and landing spots tough at times.•	If you’re a completionist, the replayability  is very high, lots of unlocks artwork, side challenges and so on. I’m just over 5 hours in and at the 30% mark so there is a solid amount of game for the $, just don’t pay full price and don’t bother with the OST. "

												Strider, a reboot of the old arcade and NES/SNES franchise, is a sidescrolling, metroid-vania action platformer with great visuals, awesome music and pretty awesome yet precise combat. The art style is simple yet great due to the use of colour contrasts and comicbook-esque effects. The music, as much as I researched, is a reimagining of old music bits from the SNES and arcade games.The combat feels very good and there are many things to discover, learn and slice through. There are also many upgrades for your weapons and skills. The boss battles are also quite amusing yet very hard and frustrating at time.All in all Strider is a wonderful and awesome experience and is defenitely worth your time and money.			"

Highly recommended!!!			"

												So many good ideas executed very poorly. I have not played the original Strider, so keep that in mind when reading this review. Also this is my first impressions after playing it for about a little over an hour.Controls could have been better, but they are tight for the most part. Strider's animations are very good and overall graphics (especially shader effects) are pretty sweet. Sound effects and music are lacking though. There are times where you are very aware that a sound effect is missing or that the music is trying to pump you up but falls flat. Title screens and transitions seem to lack polish as well.Not enough variety in enemies. It also does this thing where bosses (middle bosses?) become normal enemies (further reducing the enemy variety). Normal enemies are mostly one-shot, which I really like in this kind of game. And the harder enemies require a little more, but not enough to slow down the pace.It tries to be a metrovania game, but I don't feel it. There is not that much back tracking and the fast pace makes it even less obvious that there's backtracking. Upgrades come at relatively good timings and keeps the gameplay fresh. Love the fact that it's an arcade style side-scroller, which means no levels, experience, talent trees, etc, etc.Overall I would say that this game seems to lack polish. It's not a bad game by any means, but probably will not be playing it again. Simple, fast-paced sidescroller with limited exploration. For it's original price ($15 at the time) I would say it's barely worth it. Any more and I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Strider 2014 is a Metroidvania and it's a pretty good one at that.  Fluid movements, great graphics, LOTS of bosses and plenty of hidden weapon upgrades and collectibles throughout this adventure.  There's over 10 bosses to take on, but most of them are push-overs.  While there's always plenty to do while exploring the game doesn't really pick up until the last 30% of the game.  The game is a little slow at the beginning, but that's to be expected for a Metroidvania.  By the time you reach the end the game's set at a fast pace and you're not ready to hang it up.  The map system sucks though.  Trying to find out where you need to go to find that missing health upgrade, large hp canister or other weapon upgrades is near impossible.  If  you select a different part of the map other than where you currently are it gets cut off and you can't see it.  Another nuisance is when the bosses are talking to you (for the Story) and you're fighting the dialog is in the way of the gameplay.  You'll simply take damage due to the fact you can't see it coming.  There's not a lot of enemies either.  Yes, there are tons of bosses, but the random enemy gets recycled throughout the game and the only differences are colors.  The game is very good though and very much worth it for anyone that likes a good Metroidvania.  Grab it on sale.  You won't be disappointed.			"

												Excellent game, a worthy successor to the original two.  They game play is very linear, and very fast paced.  Because of this, there are a few annoynces.  While controls are tight and accurate, you are forced to use the analog stick.  Not a problem for many, I myself find I will sometimes slide when I try to jump, or not launch off a wall properly.  The option to swap the analog and the D-pad would have been nice.  Others have said they had issues with controllers, however any controller using Direct Input, such as the Xbox 360 controller will work fine.  I also had none of the crashing, buggy, or non fullscreen issues.  I should also note my computer does not meet the minimum system requirements, yet still had no problem running this game beautifully.There could have been a bit more polish here and there as well.  Character models have dialog in cutscenes, though their mouths don't move.  That would have been fine in 2001, but this is 2013.  Other than that, the game is excellent, and well worth the $14.99 it costs.			"

												STRIDER is a bit of a throwback to the original NES classic with a fresh coat of paint and a bit more focus on the Metroidvania-style of gameplay. You're mobile and capable, and the enemies act just enough that you have to learn a few tricks beyond just rapidly running and slashing. While it isn't a super-huge game, the price tag reflects this, and it's a ton of fun for the purchase. Definitely worth picking up.			"

Product received for free
												This game was on my wishlist since the beginning of time, and was forgotten as many of them. Now become alive, and is striking harder!STRIDER is a great side-scroller, not fantastic, but well made. I have to be honest : the very first minutes were kinda boring. Simple smashing button and jumping frenetic to evade attacks from enemies, cuz you dont have a parry(block button), but...""hey!...this is what these games are made of... so keep playing!""After the intro, and 1st stage, i realize that some potential was painted into horizon, with unlocks, upgrades, and new challenges. And i wasn't wrong. The customization is minimal, but the progression is massive. You can have at least 20 upgrades, from classical -double jump- to aerial strikes, slides, charges and why not? ""ultra-MO-power-THA-des-FA-tru-KA-ction kills"" XDBasic enemies are easy, and a bit repetitive. Same soldiers over here and there; with some improvements over the journey. The Bosses are a little harder but not frustrating. Overall you can defeat 'em all in two tries after analize its weak points.Health Regeneration is not allowed, but you can gain some from destroying enemies and crashing ""boxes"".Checkpoints are way too far from your objective, but is the only way to advance from point to point.About the graphics, i must add that they are nice, some old vibe (robot anime series) here.The sound is quite simple but satisfying, not intrusive.Menus are classic, you can feel as you were playing some Super NES game, which made ""nostalgia"" grows. You can beat the game in 10 hours. (my real gametime isnt showed, cuz i lost internet connectivity all weekend, so i had to play offline)All in all, is a good game. I recommend to fans of the genre and alike.Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes. This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												(disregard playtime, I actually have at least 50 hours on this)CONTROLLER IS RECOMMENDED! It actually gives an advantage, which you don't normally have with the keyboard. It lets you aim with the kunai in any direction WHILE running and using other abilities!!! It's a pretty huge deal...Excellent game btw! I didn't play the original, but this is one of the best sidescrollers I've ever played. It's right up there with the Disney's Aladdin DOS game and Broforce.What I like the most about it is the movement. Complex, yet fast, lots of options. It makes running through those long levels so much less boring. Remember how in other games you have to always take a long run back towards the objective after you've explored the level? Yeah, this game makes that fun.Weapons (elements) might be few, but each are very different and further contribute to the variety and complexity of enemies and ways to take them out! Then there's also the special attacks. I sometimes forget to use them, but the highest difficulty will actually punish you for forgetting to use them. This game wants you to smash as many buttons as you can, until the screen is full of all kinds of effects. Quite literally - you can attack as fast as you can smash the button!You might be thinking, that if all you have to do is smash buttons, then the game is rather easy and very primitive. Yeah, for the first half an hour. Then it gets hard. + that's what makes this game special. In comparison, in Disney's Aladdin you sometimes had to stop and firgure out the best way to take out enemies and approach them as such. In this game you go full nuts and dash through the level like a cyberninja - for the first half of the game. Then it adds armored enemies with laser weapons, where that becomes more difficult to do, but still makes it the preferred playstyle! Run&slash all the way!			"

												I had a pretty good time with this. I didn't know what to expect, having never played a Strider game before, and I was pleasantly greeted by a fast-paced classic side-scroller. Gameplay is very hack and slash oriented, your primary weapon is a sword that can be swung incredibly fast in multiple directions, even while airborne. This gives you a wide range of flexibility when attacking enemies, which is nice. Along the way you pick up upgrades and special moves/weapons that offer some variety to your attacks. These upgrades also represent the metroidvania elements of the game, as they can be used to further explore areas of the free roaming maps that were previously inaccessible.On the technical side the game runs smooth and fast, as expected from a game of this genre. It offers a pretty good selection of graphics tweaking options, though I assume most PCs these days will have little trouble handling the game. While it’s not a visual spectacle by any means, it manages to look pretty nice, showcasing the unique art style in great detail.Overall, Strider is pretty fun through and through if you're looking for a game of this type. There are a few downsides; combat can get somewhat repetitive before you gain all of your abilities and a few of the bosses are pretty disappointing in terms of challenge, however, they are not too detrimental to the overall experience. You can run through the game pretty quickly (there's an achievement for beating it in under 4 hours), however fully exploring each area will undoubtedly add some extra playtime. Definitely recommended if you're a fan of this genre.			"

It's kept the speed of Strider 2 whilst making combat actually...you know, combat. Not ''Strider runs through everyone slashing like a wildman and they all die''. They've changed the level formula, though. Rather than a straight up 2D hack and slash, you explore a larger map (think Metroid). While I would've prefered what they did in Strider 2, this isn't bad at all and they pull it off effectively. It's honestly not a bad game, but jesus ♥♥♥♥ is the port bad.

												This seems like a decent take on Strider Hiryu.While the gameplay is totally different to the original material, it seems to keep up the speedrun aspect of the original game, which is nice.What isn't though, are the technical issues I have been experiencing :  a quick look at the forum will tell you the absolute gambling aspect of jumping in, playing this game, and expecting consistent performance, something I can attest to. Capcom Chaos!Another big annoyance for me was the forced dependency to the X360 controller if you plan to use a gamepad, which is even more of an annoyance in a game where there is no way to reconfigure the controls.Disappointing.

http://bossdungeon.com/review-strider/ - Full review.Strider is a game that gets off on the right foot in a lot of cool ways. Fantastic controls, high-speed hacking and slashing, and some satisfying boss fights. Unfortunately, it never quite lives up to the promise or standards set by those first couple of hours. Action quickly becomes bland and not very engaging, and enemy variety is severely limited, save for the tiny smattering of larger robotic enemies that are thrown in from time to time. Hiryu's power-ups never really feel all that vital or add much to the mechanics, and largely function to open doors that inhibit progress or hide some shiny baubles scattered about. The exploration part of the game feels largely like an afterthought, and the only things that really feel worth hunting down are the health and special weapon power-related upgrades. Everything else feels fairly inconsequential, which is due mostly to the game's unfortunate and boring combat. If you really NEED to play another one of these kinds of games, by all means, Strider will probably be your cup of tea, but if you want something that's a little more engaging, it's best to look elsewhere.

												Strider is a Metroidvania 2.5d game and a very difficult one at that. As of the release date which is today (Feb 19th 2014) the game has an issue with studdering and crashes for some people, as well as enemies hitting you when they really shouldn't have and not registering moves. Not sure if most of the stuff is unlocked later in the game or what, but I can't use anything like kunais... only jump, primary attack, and secondary attack and stuff gained later after a ""boss battle"" (bosses become regular enemies after you beat the first one.) so the degree of difficulty is very high. Controls feel very clunky for most of the time.At the moment, I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone not looking for extreme difficulty and platforming like crazy. If you need a game to hold your hand, look some place else. If you love challenging yourself, metroidvania titles, or speedrunning (which looks like it will be great for) then you should pick it up now, otherwise avoid at all costs or wait for a great deal. Some of these issues might be fixed in the next couple of days, so keep an eye out for that. Recommend a controller over a keyboard, but you can use the keyboard without issue; stablity really cripples this game severely.Graphic: 6.5/10SFX: 4/10Music: 8/10Stability: 1.5/10Glitchiness: 3/10Keyboard Controls: 4/10Controller Controls: 7/10Overall: 4.9/10Length: You can beat the game in <4 hours, but I doubt you will on your first run unless you are great at this genre.Difficulty: Very High.I'd recommend this once the stability and glitches are fixed, which are understandable in a new release, but shouldn't remain for too long.

												New Strider: do NOT buy.The writing is cheesy, fine. It's supposed to evoke late eighties / early nineties plotlines, fine. When it's so pointlessly ""WE'RE EVIL LOL"" that it breaks all immersion in the game, it's BAD. I can't take it seriously.Then they had a single section that punished exploration. In a Metroidvania game. How stupid can you be?Fine, it's *ONE* place, but even that is enough to annoy me.Also, naming your bosses after the Winds? Revengeance did it first and better. And it just makes me want to go play that instead.Don't buy it, people. Not worth your money. The combat is dumb, the chargeup on the cypher is dumb, and whilst the movement is gloriously fluid and quick... that's the ONLY redeeming feature the game had to me.			"

												This game had so much potential that it almost hurts that it didnt live up to what it couldve been. The graphics and art style are generally amazing and i really enjoy how the plasma sword and scarf effects are rendered. The story in this game is quite literally non-existant. The story can be summarized in 1 sentence and that is ""Strider must kill the evil dictator"" and thats it. Now dont get me wrong Im all for the assassination mission style of story, but after that 1 sentence is told to you at the beginning of the game there is no more of it afterwards. The CastleVania genre has never been one of my favorites, but this game does a good job of scattering health and weapon upgrades consistently across the map. Now here are my problems with the game: First of all its is way too short. I got an achivement for beating it in under 4 hours ON ACCIDENT. I even got most of the upgrades and all the weapon mods. The final boss is also disappointingly easy and saying the ending is rushed is an understatement. You beat the final boss then BAM credits! overall id give this game a 5/10. This doesnt mean the game is bad though, its just average. I recommend you pick it up for $5 during a sale, but it is not worth full price.			"

												Strider is an excellent side scrolling revamp/remake of a classic NES title from the late 1980s. You are a futuristic ninja battling against evildoers in a dystopian society.This game is very comparable to other modern side-scrollers including the brilliant Mark of the Ninja and 360 Arcade exclusive, Shadow Complex. However, unlike Mark of the Ninja, the ninja in Strider does not rely on stealth. He relies on speed and using various abilities gained throughout the game.Boasting excellent graphics and sound, Strider is a very smart and very fun game that I've been enjoying since I started playing. Like games of yore, Strider takes boss battles seriously and you will find a challenge early on in the game when you come across a boss. You must use strategy and learning their rhythm to defeat them. A few of the earliest bosses are relatively easy button bashers, but you will soon run into others that will give you fits.This is a very strong effort and backed by Capcom, I hope to see more of these classic titles remade modern. I highly suggest a controller to enjoy this game to its fullest potential.If I had any criticism of it, it would be that I wish the controls were a little tighter when evasion is important. However, that could be more down to my lack of precision than the game itself. If you enjoy side-scrolling action games that remind you of the great games of yesterday or even if you're too young to remember and just enjoy an action challenge, Strider could be your ticket to fun. I'm 3 hours in and only 10% complete, so I'm hopeful that there's plenty more hours to come in this very fun game.			"

												Short review: Skip this game. It is remarkably mediocre.Long Review:Strider is boringly forgettable as a platformer, as a Metroidvania, and as an action combat game. There is really nothing compelling about it, and its strongest point is that the experience is nice and short (~5 hours on normal difficulty). My major complaints,- The map: This is the worst map I've seen in a Metroidvania, and I've played a lot of them. It has two major problems that are compounded by the lack of useful fast-travel mechanics. The map is basically linear, sprawling from right to left, and the environments are barely distinguishable (basically, sheet metal factory is all you'll see throughout). Because of this, there are few shortcuts to unlock and I never had a moment that made me say ""wait what, this connects to THIS!"" I never really had any idea where I was unless I was constantly checking the world map. You do unlock a couple of powers that let you jump between points, but these warp points are so disjointed (with little indication of where you'll actually end up) that they don't provide a satisfying or quick way to get from one point to another, even at end-game. It just kills any desire to explore or backtrack. It also seems like the designers realized this, because they actually mark all of the important power-ups on your map (only cosmetic and alternate game mode unlocks are truly hidden).- Enemies: this goes hand-in-hand with the uniform environments, but the enemy variety is just not there. There are basically 5-6 enemies that are palette-swapped throughout the game (human soldier, flying drone, ape robot, spider robot, turret, acid-spitting bugs). Even though the game does give you a nice set of powers to mess around with, the combat feels very one-note because you just seem to be fighting the same battles over and over again. This does not go for the boss fights though, which are pretty fun.			"

												just got this game. would like to properly play it w/a usb gamepad but apparently 2 multi-billion $ corporations want me to take a programming lesson in hacking usb controller support before i can play this game that has almost been out for a year now.  this may be a fine process for some, but this is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥support that I'm sure the PS4 & Xbone versions don't have to put up with.  There's gonna have to be a lot more order if they intend the OS & Machines will have any hope in the market compared to consoles.  Things like this make it hard for me to continue recommending friends to pc gaming.  I will eventually play this game when I want to go thru the inconvenience of (apparently non-official or sanctioned from Steam or Capcom) guides.  At a glance of the guide,  it seems I've had more ease setting up emulators than the steps the guide seems to indicate.  The game apparently doesn't recognize (at least for me) 2 separate usb controllers (Sabrent 12 btn usb pad & playstation pad w/adaptor) that work with Street Fighter IV just fine.  The title screen alone looks cheaply done & not impressive as seeing the first Strider game many years ago.  I hope the game is more entertaining than this initial impression I have.update 1/30/15: the game crashes randomly upon booting many times for no apparent reason;   looked online for fix & basically found nothing solid.  used xbox360ce to emulate 360 / xinput pads since this is the only type of pad the developers apparently bothered to allow.  this app alone causes the game to crash as well and the app hasn't been updated in a while afaict.  I only really get the app to work by luck it seems due to it being a factor of the game crashes.  i refuse to drink the ""buy a 360 pad"" kool-aid for any game esp if my pads work 100% for every other game if i can avoid it.  The game is good but not w/o its complaints.  First, it's buggy--random sound effects occur when they are not supposed to (ie level change sound while just running around); i had to reset the game many times while exploring & climbing b/c he'd get stuck in walls but wasn't that big of a deal to me; maps would show an item as not collected (therefore preventing full 100% achievements for a section from being obtained) even though it was obvious it had been; set to play on hardest setting (b/c found the game too easy on lesser difficulties) but didn't get hardest setting achievement--not a big deal but just a little annoying.  The game also doesn't provide quite the impact of the original (the ape boss was too easy & not very large or imposing--he was kinda easy in the original too but more imposing.  There wasn't much variety in the landscapes (was hoping for a dinosaur stage & weird end boss it had from original; no amazon/jungle stage.  There is no save file, if u want to start from beginning, all your previous progress is lost and once u beat the game, you can't use anything u acquired--this is just lazy on their part.  The only thing that remains is the challenge levels which is better than nothing but still not a sign of thoroughness.  Seems like the game was cut in development probably b/c DH knew they were gonna be purchased by Amazon so they just put some polish on console versions first, then whatever time was left--if any--for the pc version.  The game just feels like they rushed it & didn't give it its due.  A concept like Strider is very cool & should be given the full treatment.  Would love to see future versions include blocking or a combo system like ninja gaiden's but uniquelly Strider.  Perhaps the 3d treatement mixed w/some 2d stages if done cohesively.  Also starting the game off w/o the cypher for a level or two if storyline is more epic / movie caliber.  I prefer the original robotic panther but the eagle in this version may be better.  Also preferred the orbs which were more dynamic in movement in the original.  Would've liked to see more & bigger closeups of Strider & his enemies but understand the panoramic & scale of the environments may have been lessened to a degree.  The last tower stage & meio fights; the shiny effects; the sound effects & the music; the different costumes were also cool.			"

												I wanted to like this game.  Well, at first, I wanted to hate this game, because it could barely run full screen - Strider was more like SlowWalker.  Even though I have a relatively nice, new computer, I turned down the graphics, and it ran more smoothly (read: MORE, not completely).  Once I actually got to the game play, I wanted to like this game - a fast slashy ninja game is always fun.  Except this one, where they mess up various aspects of the game play and game mechanics, especially jumping away from walls, their stupid gravity thing, and the useless plethora of attack types.  So while the game had promise, it certainly let me down.  Then there's the length -  I finished the story mode in just over 5 hours, and I think I was eating dinner for 2 of those hours, so you're not getting a lot for your money.  Finally, theres' the laughable plot. There's less plot than in an early Sonic game, and of what is there, I think it's supposed to be a satire of Dragon Ball Z and Star Wars mixed with some Russia.  All in all, I would only buy this if you're okay with several flaws, or if it's less than $3....			"

A short yet fast 2D action-platformer with metroidvania-like exploration where you'll be required to backtrack a bit and open up new places in the world with the new things you get as you play the game. The game takes a lot from the previous Strider games including the enemies/bosses and power-ups/upgrades included in it along with its own new features.Difficulties range from Easy, Normal, and Hard. The only difference with these is the damage differences; the higher the difficulty the more hits you need to dish out and the fewer hits you can take, though I'm finding Normal to still be a bit easy and Hard actually causing me to die quite a lot which kind of forces me to actually pay attention to how I should be avoiding taking damage while still hacking and slashing. The hacking and slashing is as fast as you press the attack button which can be very tiring. You can attack at almost anytime you do anything and the direction as to where you slash can also be manipulated to be pointed almost anywhere around you as you please. I didn't find the exploration part to be very rewarding since a lot of the optional things you go back for can only be attained somewhat late in the game and there's no sort of New Game + to keep at least some of the upgrades. Plus there's a lot of strenuous backtracking to get these optional items.I found it to be a lot of fun though to sort of speed run through the game and mostly follow the indication of where I should run to next. Because it's a 2D platformer a controller is best suited.			"

												It's probably ok for a remake/reimagination of 1988 game.But for a game released in 2014 it incorporates THE WORST possible design decisions.- No tutorial or introduction of some sort (the controls are pretty standard, though)- No feasible story- Bad placement of checkpoints. For instance, if there's a boss fight, the checkpoint is not right before the boss, but 5 minutes ago- Boss fights are extremely repetitive (as are fights with the common enemies, but bosses don't die so quickly)- As noted in the other negative review, all bosses are pretty similar- Enemies respawn when you get back to a previously visited locationOverall, this feels like a 20 year old arcade game with modern visuals. I had a fair share of these games back then, so excuse me, if I don't like this one.			"

												Strider is just one of those really satisfying games. Mashing the attack button to see how fast you can get the cypher going feels so good. The action platformer is a genre that should definetly make a come back. Double Helix did a pretty good job of capturing that sense of 80s action games while still giving it a modern feel as well.But there is a down side... This game runs like crap. It's not a very demanding game in terms of graphics, but I still get tons of slow-down in the middle of boss fights and stuff. When it was first released, the game couldn't run in 1920x1080p, but now that issue has been fixed. Hopefully they'll continue to release updates to fix the issues.			"

												If you like your 2D sidescrollers fast paced, this is the game for you.  If you grew up on Strider either on the NES or the Genesis, and you always wondered what it would be like if Strider HIryu was in HD, this is the game for you.  The only thing I don't like so far is the soundtrack--I think they could've done a better job with the remix of the classic tunes.  Should have been more dramatic with real instrumentation.  Nevertheless, if you loved the previous games, you'll enjoy this one too.Please note that if you're having problems getting it to start, turn off your antivirus and firewall, uninstall and reinstall it, and you should have better luck.  I was having an executable error until I tried that, and voila, it boots.Enjoy!			"

												Although I have not played the original strider games, Strider (2014) was a refreshing game to play this year. The game has extremely smooth control and fast action gameplay, which makes it an extremely crazy game when there are a lot of enemies. Stider, being the ninja that he is, has a ton of crazy ways to get around so you'll feel like you ARE him. The one thing I've noticed about this game, is that it feels like an extremely fast version of Metroid. The map system is extremely familiar, it has a similar power up system, similar exploration and similiar item hunt. That is not a bad thing though, that makes the game even better! It's basically metroid with a super fast ninja main character instead!The only con that I could say is that unless you play on Hard difficulty, the game is pretty easy. Overall, it's a fantastic experience and I highly recommend it. Double Helix did a fantastic job on bringing strider to the modern day.  "

You attack as fast as you can push the button-Good lenghty game.

												High octane fueled game. The story makes zero sense but you just keep moving forward. The combat is pretty great. There are some cool nods to the older Strider games and I think this is a great modern version of it.The main downside is that the difficulty ramps up quite hard throughout the game and if you don't go out of your way to collect upgrades that are hidden throughout the levels you will run against a boss that you can hardly damage and that does way too much damage to you. I basically ended up cheating since I didn't want to go back and collect all the upgrades.So keep in mind that you are supposed to explore the levels even though the game kindof encourages you to go guns blazing through all the levels.

												This is practically as generic as a 2D hack-n-slash game can get. You just mash against the enemies until they die for years. I pursued the campaign in hopes that the enemies become more challenging and creative. They don't become anymore than punching (or, rather, slashing) bags until very far into the game. And even then, it barely takes much effort at all to shove them aside and continue towards the objective point.The world aspect itself is in the style of Metroid or Iga-related Castelvania games. Much simpler than the likes of those games, though. Finding extras doesn't take much effort, you either find them by going through unexplored areas, or simply go back to it later when you have an ability to overcome the 'obstacle. (read: Funny-looking Door)' Everything felt like the beginning of Super Metroid, where they're easy to attain. And it just seemed to stay that way for this title.Bosses are not challenging in the slightest. There isn't anything more to them, for the most part, besides avoiding their attacks. Once they're not attacking, mash against them like your life depends on it.I really don't understand why there's much praise for this game. Just like when this team took a crack at Silent Hill, it feels unimaginative and bland. Almost soulless. But I will give credit where it's due, Strider himself controls excellently, it makes it an even bigger shame that they put a character that functions as well as this in a game that has almost nothing new or exciting to offer.

												The Tang emperor is betrayed by one of his generals, who installs himself as emperor in the East Capital. The son of one of his slave workers escapes to the Shaolin Temple, learns kung fu, and sets out to kill the traitor, who killed his father. The monks have to help him, and in the process, they save the true emperor, who rewards them greatly. Based on a true story from Shaolin folklore, but highly fictionalized.			"

The exploration adds a lot of fun and whenever your stuck there is always somewhere else you can go.I would strongly suggest this to people who enjoy games such as Castlevania, Devil May Cry and who want to have their skill tested on harder difficulties.

In classic 2-D RPG style of Castlevania SOTN, you level up as you go and gain different abilitys that help you along the way. For 14.99 its a bargain IMO.			"

												I haven't owned or played any Strider game yet but I have a little idea of what it is from Marvel vs. Capcom 1. Feels like a good side-scroller, a little linear but gives you a lot of action.COMBAT: Combat looks hectic, but surprisingly its very easy to get into, and so far it's not being too repetitive. Too bad there's no combo counter somewhere...LEVELS: Traversing levels feels like a huge puzzle. You can stick to walls and ceilings, smash down or slide through grates, but there are a lot of unexpected traps and you'll have to find ways to either avoid or disable them. It's good fun, but could sometimes get a little frustrating when throwing a few enemies on the side.GRAPHICS: I just don't get why there's not enough graphics settings to toy around with, with a few of the characters rendered like something from 2009 up-close, even when all settings are maxed.SOUND: Not the best, but not bad either. Arcadey-style music and sounds fit in nicely. Voice acting sounds generic, though. Also note that the subtitles occupy 1/5 of the bottom of your screen (even at 1600x900 resolution), so you might want to disable them.Very few flaws, but at this price, it's still a good buy.  Grab it during a sale or not - you won't be disappointed.RECOMMENDED***EDIT*** Might I add that I preordered this game and checked out the artbook - it's not the usual awesome artbooks that Capcom used to have with Udon, and it did not even give a behind-the-scenes look towards the art of the game. What a disappointing addition to such a good game.			"

												As a side scrolling hack and slash classic game reboot, Strider (2014) keeps you entertained. The pace is very quick and the gameplay is addicting. Although this game is a side scroller, the strider world is pretty vast, as I found myself spending hours trying to go back to places looking for uprades I missed or reach places after attaining certain upgrades themselves. Strider Hiryu is also one of my favorite fighters on Marvel VS. Capcom 2, and a lot of his abilities are somewhat transferred over to this game. The visuals are pretty striking at times but it's certainly something you may not notice at first as you are more concerned with killing everything in sight. Overall, Strider is a pretty great game and I would recommend it.			"

												The 80's reborn! Bigger! Better! Brighter! Faster! Absolutely beautiful and painstakingly accurate reboot of an epic franchise.  Everything a nostalgic 80's Strider fanboy (fanperson?) nutcase could want is in this eye-popping package.  From the cypher, to the music, to the angle of Hiryu's run, it is all here in vibrant HD wonderificness.  Slash, dash, and bash through beautiful Kazakh City while you seek to destroy the almighty Meio and his mechanical minions.  Buy it. Play it. Love it. Do it all again the next day.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Though if you are, you're clearly suffering from a disfiguring case of sadimus no-funicus, and must seek immediate medical attention.  Seriously. Just buy this dang thing.			"

												Excellent side scrolling platformer with gameplay similar to Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night. Hard difficulty is not really that difficult, save for a few bosses and Meio's tower at the end of the game, where the difficulty gets ramped up considerably and out of nowhere. Tracking down collectibles is somewhat painstaking. One of the achievements (Didn't miss a beat) is very late in the game and you only get one shot at it, which is kind of ridiculous.			"

												Take the pacing and action of Strider 2 on ps1 (button mash heaven with only action and violence between you and the goal), the linearity/non-linearity of Metroid Fusion (the map always tells you where to go), and world/level design reminiscent of Mega Man x3 stages that are stitched together into a single, contiguous world (the secrets aren't ever that far off the path, for the most part), and this is essentially what I pulled away from the experience. I felt it was built with hard mode in mind as the main difficulty, as the risk vs reward dynamic is lacking in normal, and nonexistent in easy. The only bad thing that really stands out to me is the lackluster&generic soundtrack - after beating each difficulty once, I still can't remember any song from the game. Regardless, it's a great 2.5d platformer that knows how to communicate the rules and pacing of its action-centric world to the player.			"

												A delightful blend of all three past incarnations of Strider, rebuilt with modern design sensibilities and polish.Hiryu is, as ever, a joy to control, capable of traversing all manner of terrains with ease. A steady stream of unlockable abilities, power-ups, and hidden collectibles keeps the gameplay fresh while encouraging, and often demanding, exploration. While Hiryu begins with only his standard cartwheel jump and Climbsickle, you'll soon be Sliding, Double Jumping, and Plasma Catapulting yourself all over the map.Combat has been improved in several ways, perhaps one of the most notable being the addition of aimable Cypher attacks. A seemingly simple change, but one which adds a great deal of depth and enjoyment to the formula. Other additions include throwable kunai, a launcher which juggles enemies into the air, a strong ground-slamming dive (Downstrike), and the Charge Attack, which deals greater damage.Exploration and combat is further deepened by the return of Hiryu's robotic Option companions and the introduction of four Plasma Types (Reflect, Burst, Ultra-Cold, and Magnetic), which can be used to alter the properties of your Cypher, Kunai, and Plasma Catapult. In addition to their obvious combat applications, these power-ups can all be used to help traverse the map.The art direction, helmed by Strider 2's character designer, is strong and substantive, providing a familiar look to the characters while updating them in new and visually interesting ways. Though dark and drab at times, the scenery is beautifully rendered and constantly sells the scope of Kazakh City, with vistas that stretch off into the distance, overflow with life and activity, and often become their own distinct sections of the map.The soundtrack is incidental and moody with just a hint of dubstep, and contains a mixture of new tracks and remixed tunes from all three previous Strider games. The distinct ""shing"" of Hiryu's Cypher and his ceaseless ""ha!"" have been mercifully toned done, and the various bits of dialogue spoken by the countless grunts just before Hiryu murders them are a nice addition. Occasional announcements broadcast by a couple of the bosses can get a bit annoying, but are thankfully silenced after they are defeated.The game is just long enough; a speedrun will likely take 2 to 4 hours to complete, but a full clear with 100% completion could take anywhere from 8 to 16. There are also a few unlockable modes, including speed-oriented time trials and combant-oriented survival missions.All in all, Strider is a strong showing from Double Helix, and a particularily solid budget title. At the low price of $15, it's hard to think of a reason not to pick this game up -- just keep in mind that the system requirements for the PC version are fairly high.			"

												If you are un familiar with the Strider series think of this as a perfect mash of Metroid and Ninja Gaiden. This game is not exactly new but is new to steam and still hold to as being a really fun and challenging experience. It is fast paced fighting style side scrolling platformer with great power ups to make you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥and highly recommend if you are normally attracted to this particular genre.			"

												Strider is a very enjoyable game. Includes stunning visuals, an interesting world to explore, unique upgrades and near seamless action. All this bundled with one of the most satisfying dash attacks in recent history.If you are looking for a good ride without the need of a major commitment pick this game up ASAP.			"

												Strider 2014 brings the sometimes obscure, mostly awesome Arcade (and PS) classic action platformer into the next generation with fluidity, grace and sheer awesomeness. The new Metroid-vania elements to the game do nothing to stifle its appeal, charm or pace; and the game never feels like it is slowing down or letting up.Everything that long-time series fans love is here, the memorable characters, the lightning fast and tight-as-can-be controls and that good ol' *SCHING* that the Cypher makes while it is swung at mach speeds. If you are a fan of 2D Action, the good old days of arcades or a main-stay fan of the original series, this game will not disappoint.That being said, it won't surprise you, and is not entirely innovative with its design - So if you think Strider 2014 will re-write the wheel, dial back your expectations. If all you expect is a good time, then hot damn you've chosen the right game.			"

												For $15? Sure. It's a bit easy though, so play it on Hard mode even if it's your first playthrough. [[Update: It gets harder even if you're not on Hard mode. I still didn't have to use much strategy or precision until a while into the game, though.]]This is a good-looking game, and the controls feel good. The overall design in this game is good, and leads to some satisfying moments when you learn enemy patterns and start getting fast, clean kills. I can't make any comments about this game in relation to previous games in the series, unfortunately.There are leaderboards and some time attack levels, which is really cool. The game has a lot of replay value if you enjoy that kind of competition.			"

With an arrow constantly letting you know which way to go to continue the game. Plus infinite lives/resuming from a checkpoint.At best it feels like an Xbox Live Arcade game, than a game. At worst its an over-simplified, watered down, dumbed down, casual reimagining of Strider. Glad I didn't pay full price.			"

												Strider Hiryu is a character that I was first introduced to by watching the DEATH BATTLE! between him and Ryu Hayabusa from Ninja Gaiden. Hiryu was a badass, and (spoiler alert) defeated Ryu. So when I saw this game that I hadn't heard about before on sale and recognized it's main character, I decided to try it out, and boy, does this game have a lot to offer besides just a ball-busting protagonist! The story is set in the dystopian future of 2048 in the Russian city of Kazakh which is ruled by the oppresive Meio, a godly being who plans to wipe out humanity so that he can re-build the world in his own vision. You play as the previously mentioned Strider Hiryu, an extremly skilled ninja who must defeat Meio and restore peace to Kazakh and prevent apocalypse. The game is a Metroidvania-style hack-and-slash action-adventure platformer (wow that's a long genre name), where you use your plasma cypher to slay enemies, and as you progress in the game, you collect upgrades to your weapons, your health and energy and even new weapons and techniques. As one would expect from a Metroidvania game, these abilities and weapons are equally as useful in defeating enemies AND overcoming obstacles. The gameplay is flawless, which is mandatory for a game with such gameplay principles, and it is unbeliavebly satisfying and fun. The graphics look really nice during gameplay. When the charactermodels are zoomed in on during cutscenes, they don't look as good, but it is of little concern. All design choices are very good and everything really possesses the grim science-fiction feel the developers went for. The music, while not very memorable, is atmospheric and fitting, and it warmed my heart to hear some wobbles among the ambient noises and musical tones. Voice-acting, story, characters etc. is good, but again, not very memorable. Even on medium difficulty, the game presented quite a challenge, but it is forgiving, which I think is important in a game like this. All in all, if you like platform games, hack-and-slash games, or Metroidvania style games and play for the gameplay more than anything else, I recommend Strider with all my heart. And I also recommend playing with a controller. I haven't tried to play without one, but the thought is frightening.9/10			"

												A slashing dose of old school fun, this is a solid entry into the Strider series. I'll admit I've always been a big fan of the series so I'm a little biased. There's nothing ground-breaking here, but it is what it is, which is fast-paced hack-n-slash fun with a decent bit of platforming thrown in. That being said, there are some flaws.You're not going to be held captive by a breathtaking and heroic ninja story. The boss fights are underwhelming. Enemy variety isn't anything special either.But still, you're a f*kn ninja.Strider controls silky smooth and his abilities make minced meat out of anything in your path.  The graphics are decent, with some vibrant colors, but the environment variety is a bit lacking.As far as replay value, I'm just not seeing it here. There are some collectibles (outfits, concept art) which are pretty standard fare and don't really warrant another play through to collect all. I recommend snagging this game at a nice discounted price during a sale, it'll give you at least 10-15 hours of good ninja frolicking. If you're a big fan of the series, don't hesitate to add this to your collection.			"

												This is the definition of filler. It is fun to a point, it is not poorly made, and it is completely forgettable. The gametime is only five hours, which is really nice, you can complete it in two or three sittings, it's over before you get bored. The best feature is that the standard attacks are matched exactly to button mashes and there's no cap, so you can hit enemies and bosses literally as fast as you can mash the button. The worst feature is the voice acting and dialogue. For instance (mild spoiler, though come on, not really), when you get to the main boss, he says something along the lines of ""Good, you have defeated all my henchman, I was meaning to get rid of them anyway for their insolence."" So, the man is happy that someone... killed all his employees...? And every line is delivered in what might be described as ""villain-fey,"" a cadence that wobbles around like a drunk clown on a bull-riding machine. This needs to stop, let's have some more respect for our villains, people.			"

												6.5/10. I was greatly disappointed by this game. A game by my favorite studio and gotten good critic and user reviews. But this game is the definition of mediocrity and blandness. Most of the game is spent running around the same looking futuristic drab landscape, where every level feels the same. You fight the same 3-4 guys the entire game (they try fooling you by changing color of the soldier’s uniform to make you think it is a different enemy…..I wasn’t fooled), minus the occasional mini-boss. There are many boss fights, which is a nice change of pace, unfortunately the game uses the unfortunate trope of repeating multiple bosses. The levels are big open levels, although they are mostly empty and boring, and involve much backtracking. Most of what you will find by searching around is boring concept art nobody every cares about. The other thing you will find is upgrades. In order to gain any health or energy upgrades you need to scour every single level all over the place. You start with the smallest health bar I have ever seen in a game. Don’t play the game on hard because guys shoot multiple shots are once that are impossible to dodge, as you are the least elusive acrobatic ninja ever. All you can do is do a slow jump in the air where you spread out, or just run at people. There is a slide but it is slow, you do a spin first to do it, and you can still get easily hit while doing it. In hard guys do tons of damage, the health pickups give you almost no amount, and bosses take tons of retries. The terrible checkpoints mean you will have to start in areas before the boss and you will have to watch the crappy cutscene again. There is literally no story, and the small amount of dialogue/cutscenes involve terrible voice acting and models that (no joke) don’t open or move their lips when they talk. Then there’s the combat. It is the most boring ever. You literally just spam x (basic attack) as fast as you can while running at guys. The same is for the bosses. You have a charge-up attack that takes too long, and an upward slash that is completely useless. You never learn combos or anything special. By the time you learn a teleportation, or using other elements in your attack, its 2/3 done with the game already. The first 2/3 is just doing the same slash move over and over with every guy as fast as you can while you run straight at them. It became so boring and monotonous that I just tried jumping past guys to get to the next area. You can also be continuously juggled and killed with certain enemy combinations, as happened to me a few times. The platforming can be fun and inventive sometimes. You can climb and stick to walls, which is not common in many platforms. Unfortunately, more than not, it frustrates. It is very finicky and hard to control. There is a way to move fast up a wall, but not horizontally move across the wall, meaning it’s super slow. For some reason on platforms you can’t swing around from above to under it. If you try to jump from hanging below something you must drop first, then try to jump. Many times I would try to jump off the side of a wall and it wouldn’t let me detach. Other times I would try to jump over something and it would make me grab onto the side of it. The worst problem I faced, above all else, was the checkpoints. On multiple occasions I would exit to a new level, and see a “checkpoint” icon in the top right. I would then quit the game, and upon coming back see that the game didn’t save my progress and I was back at a previous level. In one occurrence I had to redo an entire boss fight, and go to the next level again, because the same hadn’t saved my progress. What game in 2015 doesn’t save progress AFTER A BOSS FIGHT AND THEN A LEVEL SWITCH?”!!?! This meant that I would never want to exit the game, because I never knew what it would save and what I would have to repeat. I couldn’t even count on beating a boss or starting a new level to mean it had saved, as those normal staples were apparently not part of the game’s save function. The game does have decent length, and I still BARELY recommend it because there are a few times where the game shines and the platforming is and inventive, or a boss fight is enjoyable, or some of the new powers you get later on, including throwing stars, teleportation, etc, are fun. I just don’t get why they have you get them so late in the game. The backtracking definitely frustrates as well. There are MANY other better options in the action/platformer genre, and use this only as a last resort if you've run out of other good ones to play. Wait for a sale, as 15 dollars is definitely too much to ask.  "

												This is a remake of an old Arcade game from 1989.It's a fast side-scrolling hack & slash platform action game that's really fun to play.I recommend playing this with an XBOX 360 controller.The graphics and sound are great and suit the game.The game supports the resolution 2560:1080 but only in 16/9 - ultra wide (21/9) is not supported - so there are black bars if you play on this resolution.I took me 12 hours to finish - so this is a rather big game with a lot of things to explore and extras to unlock.Replayability via higher difficulty and some challenge modes.

												A slashing dose of old school fun, this is a solid entry into the Strider series. I'll admit I've always been a big fan of the series so I'm a little biased. There's nothing ground-breaking here, but it is what it is, which is fast-paced hack-n-slash fun with a decent bit of platforming thrown in. That being said, there are some flaws.You're not going to be held captive by a breathtaking and heroic ninja story. The boss fights are underwhelming. Enemy variety isn't anything special either.But still, you're a f*kn ninja.Strider controls silky smooth and his abilities make minced meat out of anything in your path.  The graphics are decent, with some vibrant colors, but the environment variety is a bit lacking.As far as replay value, I'm just not seeing it here. There are some collectibles (outfits, concept art) which are pretty standard fare and don't really warrant another play through to collect all. I recommend snagging this game at a nice discounted price during a sale, it'll give you at least 10-15 hours of good ninja frolicking. If you're a big fan of the series, don't hesitate to add this to your collection.			"

												A Metroidvania-style platformer. While it may be just a little less excellent than Guacamelee! in terms of mechanics, it certainly builds a better world and the voice-overs are appreciated, even if the plot is very thin.Combat is fun. You can swing your sword as fast as you press the button. Kunais and powerful special attacks are also available. The latter are quite effective in the plethora of the awesome bossfights. My only gripe were the occasional stunlocks.Strider Hiryu is very mobile and can traverse almost any terrain. Using his hooks, he can climb walls infinitely and he also dashes and double-jumps. All of it feels great. The only obstacles are enemies, locked doors and electrical fences.In terms of difficulty (I played Normal): It started off way too easy, gave me a good challenge throughout until the antepenultimate boss*, where the difficulty spiked greatly. But from there it only gets easier.			"

												If you liked Strider in the arcade, or on SNES, you're sure to like this, it also for some reason kind'a reminds Me of Castlevania SOTN, or Pandemonium 1-2 on PS/Xbox, or Megaman-X SNES/PC (if you never played previous Strider games)  anyhow it looks so nice, you'd think you're playin 3D anime (with 2D platforming movement), if you like a FAST paced  platformer game, where you have to not only go after the enemies to kill them (Ninjas don't use guns cause those are for cowards), but you also must dodge projectiles (this is a Ninja folks, they're tough, but as one famous martial artist said ""The best way to NOT get hit, is to not be there when the strike arives""), you'll also get pets (hologramatic) that'll help you in your' trek...

For Strider fans this is a must have and for fans of being awesome this is also a must have.  If you hate being awesome or you like to be lame then I can't recommend this to you.

												Strider Hiryu is a character that I was first introduced to by watching the DEATH BATTLE! between him and Ryu Hayabusa from Ninja Gaiden. Hiryu was a badass, and (spoiler alert) defeated Ryu. So when I saw this game that I hadn't heard about before on sale and recognized it's main character, I decided to try it out, and boy, does this game have a lot to offer besides just a ball-busting protagonist! The story is set in the dystopian future of 2048 in the Russian city of Kazakh which is ruled by the oppresive Meio, a godly being who plans to wipe out humanity so that he can re-build the world in his own vision. You play as the previously mentioned Strider Hiryu, an extremly skilled ninja who must defeat Meio and restore peace to Kazakh and prevent apocalypse. The game is a Metroidvania-style hack-and-slash action-adventure platformer (wow that's a long genre name), where you use your plasma cypher to slay enemies, and as you progress in the game, you collect upgrades to your weapons, your health and energy and even new weapons and techniques. As one would expect from a Metroidvania game, these abilities and weapons are equally as useful in defeating enemies AND overcoming obstacles. The gameplay is flawless, which is mandatory for a game with such gameplay principles, and it is unbeliavebly satisfying and fun. The graphics look really nice during gameplay. When the charactermodels are zoomed in on during cutscenes, they don't look as good, but it is of little concern. All design choices are very good and everything really possesses the grim science-fiction feel the developers went for. The music, while not very memorable, is atmospheric and fitting, and it warmed my heart to hear some wobbles among the ambient noises and musical tones. Voice-acting, story, characters etc. is good, but again, not very memorable. Even on medium difficulty, the game presented quite a challenge, but it is forgiving, which I think is important in a game like this. All in all, if you like platform games, hack-and-slash games, or Metroidvania style games and play for the gameplay more than anything else, I recommend Strider with all my heart. And I also recommend playing with a controller. I haven't tried to play without one, but the thought is frightening.9/10			"

												Fun little hack & slash.Fast paced, good controls and nice environments.Lacks a bit of diversity for enemies, mostly soldiers with or without shields and of drones. Pretty good leaders. Some decent searching in open world type of environments.  Im not usually a fan of hack-slash since im a bit older and it gets old after awhile, but this is a fairly fun game in hour or two doses. It seems to be about 10 hours long as well, so ample gameplay.  Brings back some nastalgia and memories of the original classic way back around the late 80's or very early 90's.9/10 based on price.

												For $15? Sure. It's a bit easy though, so play it on Hard mode even if it's your first playthrough. [[Update: It gets harder even if you're not on Hard mode. I still didn't have to use much strategy or precision until a while into the game, though.]]This is a good-looking game, and the controls feel good. The overall design in this game is good, and leads to some satisfying moments when you learn enemy patterns and start getting fast, clean kills. I can't make any comments about this game in relation to previous games in the series, unfortunately.There are leaderboards and some time attack levels, which is really cool. The game has a lot of replay value if you enjoy that kind of competition.			"

												Strider is nice game and as every other game has good and bad sides.The good ones are: - Nice fluid gameplay with good abilities- Good sence of progress and becomeing more powerfull- Very good graphics and animation that completely suites the game style- Excelent boss designThe bad ones are:- Very repetitive level design with little changes in looks. Same goes for enemies with only few variations.- Map has very little usefulness. There are no indications where are level exits or enters and given that levels are almost labyrinths its very hard to navigate between areas.- Game is only challenging on hard difficulty. Easy is i think for 5 year old kids :) and medium is decent until you get 2-3 powerups. Hard is only ok mode.Maybe its sounds like flaws are bigger then posistive ones but dont get me wrong this is game where you can really enjoy. But i think it should be played in smaller game sessions so the repetitivity doesnt become too obvious. I enjoyed the game in first playtrough on normal but on hard was best feeling since it has more challenge. Anyway i recommend this game and i would say it has score 8/10.			"

This is a very good sequel to Little Ninja Bros. After losing his sibling to a deadly plague, Jack sets out to find some revenge. There are a lot of choices in this game that flesh out the story. You can choose to swing your sword, or jump, or jump and swing your sword. Those choices have a direct effect on your gameplay experience and your personal story.

												Where can i double like this title? Or the second store page trailer, more precisely when he says 'we think we delivered' and 'the most fast paced game you will find out there'?How come this game didn't make a whole lot more fuzz when released? I expected another passable remake and was blown away. TRAILERS DON'T DO IT JUSTICE- IT *FEELS* AMAZING. Amazing, fast, super responsive... are you familiar with the concept of being on 'the flow'? I tought i felt it with games before, how wrong i was- but here not only it got me in the flow, it did so mere minutes into the game. Before i noticed i was ninjaing my way without blinking!Im a game design enthusiast so let me indulge in details: this is possibly one of the best paced games i ever played if not the best. It isn't just the speed and loop between slashing and exploring- how naturally it eases you on controls and possibilities, the frequency and placement of upgrades, bosses, secrets, how tight and well designed is the big metroidvania world... i can go on and on.GRAB IT. Its worth full price, at sale its a steal. It doesn't matter what genres you're into, this is one of the rare games i would recomend anyone without blinking. BUY IT. NOW. I MEAN IT!!!			"

												Cool idea but boring game.I'm reviewing this as a huge fan of the original and this one just doesn't have the personality that one did which is a shame because some of the new abilities fit the character nicely. My main problem with the game is the repetition of nothing but steel corridors. The game starts off strong enough with some cool outdoor vistas but that ends quickly and then you're running through dark gray and brown levels. There's also no mouth movement or lip sync with any of the characters and the dialog bars that pop up all too frequently are annoying and just clutter the screen.Also, the wall climbing can feel clumsy at time especially during boss battles when you may end up clinging to a surface you really don't want to. Overall this just feels like a sci fi ""Mark of the Ninja"" in many ways which sounds like it would be super cool but I wanted an awesome ""Strider"" game instead. If you buy it, buy it on sale. It's not worth $15.			"

												Since I'm pretty tired at the time of writing, I'll keep this review concise.Would I recommend this game? No, I wouldn't. Why? Because, unlike what most people claim, the game just isn't fun. Maybe I'm crazy, but I feel like the complete lack of context and the INCREDIBLY weak excuse for a ""story"" in the game deals a rather harsh blow to it. Adding to that, the fact that the metroidvania tag applied is VASTLY misleading, I just couldn't find anything fun about it.Now, just to be clear, the game isn't bad (extremely annoying flashing lights during ""boss intros"" notwithstanding), but I honestly couldn't find any enjoyment in playing it. I suppose if I have to praise it for something, it would be that it wastes no time in letting you get to the action and start kicking äss, but the fact of the matter is that it feels like that's ALL you do. Yeah, combat is pretty centrical for ALL metroidvania games, but there's SUPPOSED to be exploration as well!Strider has essentially no exploration whatsoever. This, in case you're not aware, is a direct violation of the entire metroidvania formula. It'd be like a Super Mario game WITHOUT MARIO.All in all, between the completely hollow ""story"" and the utter lack of exploration, I can't recommend this game. It's not bad, it's just boring. For me, anyway. 4.3/10			"

												Combat is boring and repetitive. Attacks have no weight or feeling of force behind them you just run straight towards enemies mashing the attack button and they explode in front of you. No challenge at all. Too bad because the game had potential.Do not recommend.			"

												This Strider has been very well crafted and kept me going after I had purchased & downloaded it!Since it was 50% off I was thinking to myself, ""Let me bring back memories of that old cut em' up from MAME and see how this does""...Let me just say that this was a purchase worth every penny. It followed the old traditional ways and I love the whole system of gaining new skills.To be honest i'm quite speechless. Just give this game your money!			"

STRIDER is the best plaforming action game I have played in years.IMPORTANT NOTE: You should only buy STRIDER if you like good video games. If you prefer your games mediocre or bad, go play Orion: Dino Horde.Strider has all the platformy goodness of the first NES installment with a modern-day story-based progression system. The hardcore crowd will enjoy hard mode and challenge maps as well as the speed running potential. Collectors like myself will get 10+ hours of exploration and puzzle-solving to find all of the upgrades and extras in the form of retro-arcade icons. Everyone will enjoy the silky smooth mechanics and gorgeous design.Thank you Double Helix for bringing us a modern STRIDER game that has serious nostalgic value while looking and playing like a AAA title! I'll take multiples DLCs or sequels whenever you're ready!			"

												I use to play all the old Strider games, from Arcade and NES versions, to the later Sega release. Then for a long time, no Strider, until Capcom added Strider to the Marvel vs Capcom list of fighters, which gave me a bit of nostalgic feels, but wasn't the same. This new game feels like I'm playing the old games again, but in a new way that makes it even more enjoyable. Strider Hiryu moves, fights and leaps much as he did in his previous incarnations, but there is still enough newness to the way he does so that, along with the modern graphics and enemies, to me, makes it a great game I will enjoy for a long time.

												Strider Hiryu sees his long awaited return in this retelling of the original arcade classic simply titled Strider.Small-time developer Double Helix surprised everyone when they delivered the smash-hit Killer Instinct reboot to the Xbox One, does lightning strike twice or was it just luck? Let's take a look!Right off the bat, Hiryu controls like he should, rapid-fire sword-slashes and all (though he now has the ability to slash in all 8 directions, which is always welcome), he even comes straight out of the box with his Marvel vs. Capcom launcher move! As you move on from there, you'll soon discover that this game borrows largely from the NES Strider, giving you a giant, Metroidvania style map where you have to find upgrades to the futuristic Ninja to proceed.Luckily, you always have access to a very solid minimap and map telling you where to go, what kind of object is blocking your way to make backtracking once you get a new toy easier and what areas you have or haven't explored.In this kind of game, a good map is essential, and Strider pulls it off masterfully.Slashing up goons by pressing the attack button as fast as your fingers can manage is as satisfying as always, as is seeing your moves, health and special meter rise from exploration, but like the original Strider, the game-making events are without a doubt the boss battles (featuring the likes of the Ouroboros, mecha-pon, the Pooh sisters and Solo), giving you the kind of large-and-in-charge mechanical beasts you'd expect but also brings a good number of duel-type bosses to the table and manages to make them the highlight of the experience with their high-speed pattern-recognition that brings to mind the action titles of yesterday.The game is quite the looker as well, though you may find the game has surprisingly high requirements to run smoothly for a downloadable 2.5D platformer, so be sure to look at the specs.The music is largely composed of techno-styled remixes of music from previous Strider games,the arcade and NES Striders in particular and are both nostalgic and great tunes in their own rights.In closing, Strider Hiryu's rebirth was everything I could have hoped for,giving a fresh take on the franchise while still showing strong respect to the foundation they build upon, I cannot recommend Strider enough for those looking for a strong action adventure or Metroidvania-style game.

												This game is incredibly fun. It is a true metroid vania game - there are A LOT of doors you can't open until later in the game EVERYWHERE. The combat feels very good. And when you play it on hard, it can be EXTREMELY difficult. Platforming is great. Everything is pretty good, really. But, it really does feel like a bullet hell at times, and there are moments that just suck. For example: I'm around 35%-ish complete, and there is a very small and enclosed and locked room in which you have to fight 2 really big things that throw fire around everywhere and hit you extremely hard. It's not the only example, but you get the idea. Thankfully, these are few and far between, so you shouldn't have much of a problem with it.Overall, it's a great game, and for $15, it would be stupid not to try it.			"

Alot of power ups and backtracking ala Metroid style. There is many collectables to get and hidden items. Awesome boss fights and cool enemies.Some things I disliked was that there were very few enemey varieties, The game is also fairly short at 4-6 hours if you play at a normal pace. I completed it in 5 hours. If you enjoy fast, fluid combat. Then this is the game for you. Please do remember that even if it´s a bit short. It is 15 dollar or you regional equvialent.

												Very fun, highly recommend. Some of the designs/choices are frustrating, like putting a save point then a loading screening & no rebindable keys, but thats minor. Strider is very reponsive, the attacks are as fast as your clicking speed, this is a very button mashy game, the boss fights are fun and it brings back the classic game cheese while being modern.

												Strider (2014) is an re-imagining of the Strider Arcade game from Japan and follows the story of Strider Hiryu. The game uses a Metroidvania style exploration system that makes the experience feel refreshing, stylized and ultimately fun as hell to play. Using the previous mechanics of the original games plus the new system of finding upgrades gives you a feeling of growth. I highly suggest playing this game if you're a fan of old-school Capcom games, Metroid or Castlevania.That soundtrack is also pretty sweet too.Buy it, like seriously. Buy it.			"

They felt to short for how fun they were.   10 levels a piece, i could knock the whole game out in one sitting.  Besides the graphic upgrade in this new one, it takes the levels out and puts in a open world.  Yes its big, not SOTN big, but impressivly large.

The skins are useless though, they say in the description that they use a different weapon, but no, it's just Hiryu with a different color.Anyways, I would recommend this game definitly, but its like a: Done it once, uninstall it.

												This is an interesting reebot. Plays very similar to Strider 2 but with a metroidvania twist. I suppose this is because it wasn't planned as an arcade game like the other titles. It still feels like a Strider game though. You can tell they wanted to please the fans and also make something different. Bosses are very good, they don't have a weak point, or limited vunerability time or any other modern boss bullcrap. Just dodge their attacks and hit them.Combat with the grunts can get pretty annoying by the endgame when you're backtracking for upgrades. Also the enemies could have been more varied other than just colour coded shields.Story is very minimal and dialouge is very cliche (which is just right for this game surprisingly, it really worked for me). But if you're playing this sort of game you shouldn't care.The visuals are simply outstandigly beutiful, and the design is just perfect. They really nailed it!Overall I feel this is more of a spinoff than a reboot, but maybe this is what the series needs to make a comeback after all these years. It's too bad they went with just ""STRIDER"" as a title, if they had added a subtitle they might have kept a few doors open. I would recommend this game, especially if you are a newcomer. It is easier than previous titles most of the time, but you can still have fun with it, and you probably won't breeze through.			"

												I'm playing through the game on Normal, and am at the final zone.  I really like the game.  I like the fact that you have a full range of movement at the beginning of the game.  You start off bounding over rooftops and once I entered the first building and accidentally grabbed the ceiling, it was an ""AWESOME!"" moment for me.  And every new movement ability you get is just icing on that cake. And every enemy you kill restores a little bit of health, so in the beginning of the game, you are pretty much encouraged to run face first into gunfire, because killing the enemy will give you more health than the damage you take.  Eventually, that disparity closes, but the game does an amazing job of making you feel badass. I like the fact that the game eschews levels.  It feels like every game since SotN has made a point to shoehorn levels into this style of game, and so you can just grind levels to make bosses easier.  This game forces you to skill up instead.  Which leads to:Bosses.  There is a lot of discussion in the forums and reviews about how challenging the bosses are, and honestly, I think they are just about right.  For the first half of the game, I died at least twice to almost every boss, but the final time I beat them, I did it while losing hardly any health, meaning that I had learned the patterns and applied the correct countermeasures.  The bosses are challenging, but not cheap.  For the second half of the game, I was mostly able to beat bosses on the first try, but I think that's mostly because I was both more skilled, and also had a vastly more effective loadout because of upgrades.  The only boss that is really broken is Solo, where I figured out how to dodge his attacks, but couldn't see where I was going because the camera kept zooming in and out.  It even glitched at one point and got stuck, making it worse.The upgrades are pretty simplistic, and I like the way the plasmas sort of mimic Metroid Prime's elemental attacks, and are also used to open matching doors.  And similarly, no plasma feels more powerful than any other, so your character and enemies never really get power creep, you just get better at learning patterns and attacking from range.  Each new plasma has its specific use against certain enemies.  And the plasma somersault is ridiculous fun.  Going back for collectibles and upgrades stays pretty interesting because of the few new move abilities and the way they let you bounce all over the place.  The downside is that the game does make you slog through the same levels and enemies every time you backtrack, without any shortcuts.  The map is also a bit confusing or at least unclear on some things, while at the same time it will lead you by the nose to the goals, which was a bit too much Metroid Fusion like.			"

												You ever play a game that as soon as you hit start something inside you just clicks? Like your gamer subconcious is a sleeper agent that's triggered by explosions and wanton disrespect to the laws of physics?That's Strider.The story is the only kind Capcom is good at writing, the ones with robots. You're a ninja with a laser sword slicing robotic communists to pieces whilst on a mission to assasinate a god. That's it, not exactly Bioshock levels of writing here but if that doesn't excite you than you're a ♥♥♥♥ing lobotomite.The gameplay is smooth, fast, and incredibly satisfying, while presenting many different gimmicks and moves to help you around varied and stunning environments to tackle your obsticles in any way you can imagine, making for a free-flowing world to organically explore, while several power-ups and secrets encourage you to do just that in levels so well designed backtracking isn't the least (well maybe a little) bit tedious. Some boss fights might be a bit easy but they're all fun, unique and exciting. The music isn't anything I'm going to look up on YouTube later but it's atmospheric and catchy, and I often find myself humming one of the tunes.There were many moments in Strider after I slowed gravity to freeze a drone in mid-air and used it has a platform to jump off and slam-attack Robo-Stalin in half as the panther made of light that I summoned ran around mauling his comrades to death when my exploding throwing knives detonated and finished off the rest of the room when I had to pause the game to appreciate how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing that entire display was lest my brain implode.The only problems I can think of is that when you are backtracking to get the last few collectibles is that pathways to old levels are hard to find and don't indicate where they'll send you, and that it's a little short (although that may be for the better), but the unlockable Beacon Runs and Survival makes for good replayability.Get Strider, you owe it to yourself to experience what awesome is.

												The Metroidvania hits pretty hard in this, given the unsubtle ways it throws the ""use Item X to open Door Y"" at you from the start.  That's about the most annoying part.Still, they deliver on the promise of a fairly big world to explore that's full of things to cut and dance around.  And it's a Strider game - it's fast, it's hard, it's precise and it's relatively easy to play through in one sitting.			"

												A great entry into the Strider series.  Essentially this is an expanded retelling of the arcade story with the exploration and upgrade elements of the NES version.  The controls are super-tight, and the combat is utterly gratifying.  The pacing is satisfying as well, you move from mini-bosses to new areas/upgrades to bosses at a good clip, so Strider never wears out its welcome. Unfortunately though, when you finish the game, you're only offered the option of starting all over. Without the addition of a ""new game+"" style feature, there's not much incentive for me to play this one again.  If the developers are listening a great update be an Original Audio version where the game could be played with the audio files from the old arcade game.  I miss that distinctive ""shing"" sound of Strider's sword and Meio's awesome laugh.			"

Which leads to:Bosses.  There is a lot of discussion in the forums and reviews about how challenging the bosses are, and honestly, I think they are just about right.  For the first half of the game, I died at least twice to almost every boss, but the final time I beat them, I did it while losing hardly any health, meaning that I had learned the patterns and applied the correct countermeasures.  The bosses are challenging, but not cheap.  For the second half of the game, I was mostly able to beat bosses on the first try, but I think that's mostly because I was both more skilled, and also had a vastly more effective loadout because of upgrades.  The only boss that is really broken is Solo, where I figured out how to dodge his attacks, but couldn't see where I was going because the camera kept zooming in and out.  It even glitched at one point and got stuck, making it worse.The upgrades are pretty simplistic, and I like the way the plasmas sort of mimic Metroid Prime's elemental attacks, and are also used to open matching doors.  And similarly, no plasma feels more powerful than any other, so your character and enemies never really get power creep, you just get better at learning patterns and attacking from range.  Each new plasma has its specific use against certain enemies.  And the plasma somersault is ridiculous fun.  Going back for collectibles and upgrades stays pretty interesting because of the few new move abilities and the way they let you bounce all over the place.  The downside is that the game does make you slog through the same levels and enemies every time you backtrack, without any shortcuts.  The map is also a bit confusing or at least unclear on some things, while at the same time it will lead you by the nose to the goals, which was a bit too much Metroid Fusion like.			"

												The Metroidvania hits pretty hard in this, given the unsubtle ways it throws the ""use Item X to open Door Y"" at you from the start.  That's about the most annoying part.Still, they deliver on the promise of a fairly big world to explore that's full of things to cut and dance around.  And it's a Strider game - it's fast, it's hard, it's precise and it's relatively easy to play through in one sitting.			"

												I've always been a fan of Strider since the NES days.  I wished the old arcade game would have been for console the non Capcom one called Osman.This game brings all your strider games together, compacting them in a seemlessly non conflicting way. I love action side scrollers.Ninja Hiryu better than Naruto, and Ninja Gaiden. I remember the NES version being Darker though.Definately buy this. I wish it would have came with the manga. Hopefully they make a New Strider game for next gen.This game is just a joy to play. With all the DLC games to unlock new abiilities or areas. Strider shows what old gaming was about unlockables and becoming a badass. Exploration without buying a new map. At first you'll think this game is easy but then it starts getting more puzzles and stronger weirder bosses. But its not overbearingly dficult. With the right powers equiped and specials. Strider the Ninja that is awesome.			"

												Overall an awesome game. It is more or less a metroidvania game with polish. It's just a little light on enemy and area differences. 100% completion is very fun to work for and somewhat challenging but hidden items need to be more out of sight.  If you are a Strider fan it's a must buy in my opinion and even if not I feel it's worth the price. And if and when people figure out some sequence breaking this game will be excellent to speedrun. Also, I have not had any issues with running the game. I get a solid 60fps maxed out at 1920x1080.			"

												Like Metroidvania games? Want to feel like a total badass? Don't mind a bit more backtracking than similar games and a few recycled bosses? Buy it! For a $15 base price, it's fantastic.A few notes:- Use a controller.- I found the difficulty just right, but I can see it being far too tough for those inexperienced with platformers and Metroidvania games.- I don't know anything about the Strider series, but the story/characters/dialog were pretty awful. Buy this game for the gameplay.- It doesn't hold your hand with tutorials/tips. Be prepared to be a little confused (in a good way).			"

Visually attractive, smooth gameplay (no glictchs or crashes so far) but why would I not recommending it? The controls are the biggest NO NO in my book. I find the whole controls are more suitable for a south-paw gamers. All attack commands on the left while directional keys on the right.I would have given this game a Thumbs up if at the very least, the game allowed me to change the binding but it did not provide me with such option. My muscle memories just aint suitable with south paw style. This is my review on it. Grab it at 75% off if available			"

												Warning: Starts of relatively easy and a bit repetitive but ramps-up the difficulty in BIG chunks AND loves making you repeat stuff over and over and over.As well as the big leaps in difficulty, savepoints become become less frequent so repetition grows and grows - it really does LOVE wasting your time.Many Minibosses and Bosses have unskippable intros, unskippable chatter and are generally just exercises in learning (as you watch all the intros and chatter over and over) their various moves - it's VERY VERY frustrating.Lastly, the controls are just weird - holding X to charge attacks whilst jumping with A isn't really a great layout and the charge system ""works when it feels like it"".  Platforming is also clunky at times, whether Striders grabs things or not is a bit random sometimes...Overall I'd skip this, the developers have failed to make a progressively challenging game and instead made one which has less than brilliant controls, loves making you watch to stuff and over and generally feels like a tiresome grind.

												A rather admirable reboot of a great series.Aside from some very slight control issues that really just boil down to general nitpicking, the game plays very well. It's very satisfying to button mash enemies into oblivion. The skill aspect of combat comes from dodging rather than attacking well, so you're free to slash the hell out of things to your heart's content, with some enemies requiring a charge-up 'guard break' before you can do so. Aside from that, the gameplay is very Metroidvania indeed. Powerups are scattered in locations that are both mildly challenging and frustratingly difficult to reach, with areas closed off to the player until they can acquire a particular powerup.The sound is fantastic as well, from music to interface feedback when you pick up items or complete objectives. The entire soundtrack is a compilation of remixed Strider themes from prior games.In the same vein, the game looks good, though poly counts are a bit dated that is in keeping with its price point. The environments are well-designed, everything is shown clearly, and the flow of levels is very visually appealing. Nothing is out of place at all in the environment.Overall, for something that Capcom clearly only put a small team to, this game is very much a good sequel in the Strider series, and one that has been VERY long coming. I'd definitely recommend this game at its price point ($15 at time of writing) for anyone, as long as you have a controller, and especially for those who enjoy platformers, adventure games. Metroidvania lovers? This is a must-buy.			"

That said, around the time enemies that could freeze and/or stun you near instantly got inroduced I began to enjoy the game alot less because enemies like that horribly broke the flow of combat, and were no fun to fight against at all. But this is my one quarrel with an otherwise amazingly fun side-scrolling slasher. For the price point of 15 dollars I would reccomend this game any day.			"

												Having become a fan of 1989's Strider and its sequel/reboot a decade later, Strider 2014 seemed like an easy purchase. Much like Strider 2, this version is also a sign of the times graphically when aesthetics tend to take a backseat on many platformers. For anyone who is a fan of the Castlevania games post-Dracula X, and the Metroid games (see tag Metroidvania), this version also uses a huge interconnected world that can be fully explored upon acquiring upgrades that allow travel through once inaccessable areas. Controls are as responsive as one would expect if they've played past Striders, with a few differences (for example, he has a launcher attack ala his Marvel vs. Capcom appearances).My main issue with the game is in its lack of optimization. I own quite a few games on Steam that are quite demanding graphically (Crysis 2, for example), but I've never had to scale them lower than 720p just to get a playable framerate. I haven't had it crash on me like other people have noted, but there's a weird rendering bug that happens after leaving the pause menu: certain pieces of terrain or the environment itself won't get filled, making it appear as though nothing's there.If they could just fix these problems, I might think of it as a solid addition to the Strider brand. For now it seems like a lazy port banking on the pre-existing hype to turn out a quick buck.			"

												Proper Brilliant.The guys who made this game know Strider, they know what makes Strider good, and they know this better than Capcom, who failed pretty miserably with their micro-level Strider 2.  I loved Strider in the arcades, I knew it inside and out, and could clear it with one life.  I feared the remake, but I needn't have.This is not the original Strider, it's more Strider meets Metroidvania, and it works.  It works so hard.  The first thing I did after completing the game (and it's not a short game) is immediately start a second game on hard.It does so many things right.  The graphics are excellent just about everywhere, and never less than really good when it stumbles.  The game occasionally opens up to really big views giving everything an immense scale, and there's a real feeling of height when you jump blindly off some platforms.  Strider's movements are perfect, from running to climbing to slashing with his sword.  Sometimes you want to screenshot your game just because it looks so fun.Strider makes frequent nods toward its history, sometimes the player will hear a sound effect taken from the original arcade game, and some levels are eerily familiar.Cannot recommend highly enough.  It's among the best.			"

												Strider is a remake of a 1989 arcade classic starring Strider Hiryu, a ninja with a quick swinging sword capable of slashing a group of troopers in an instant. He is incredibly acrobatic. It felt weird to me that there was no mouse needed to play Strider, just a keyboard. The keyboard is tolerable, although I was wondering if a gamepad is more appropriate for the PC version of this game considering all the different moves you will learn as you progress through the game making Strider a more powerful protagonist.The story is very simple as it takes place in Kazakh in the Soviet era. Once you understand the setting you will slice various enemies while you rely on your map to reach your next objective. The gameplay is very fast paced and this is a good attribute for this game. The action is also impressive and gets more impressive as you progress. You will learn new moves such as the double jump. The double jump will be crucial to jumping over obstacles such as electrical fields and moving buzz saws. Other moves include the kunai, which is a plasma weapon used to shoot enemies and becomes crucial during boss fights.There is plenty climbing up walls and ceilings and Strider has sickle that can be called a climbsickle. This is a very useful tool for navigating the different levels in an action platformer that is basically about moving horizontally and up and down. There are many collectibles in this game, some for upgrading Strider, others for cosmetic effect. The collectibles Strider can be in well hidden areas, so Strider must use his double jumps and catapults to good use in order to find these collectibles. The most important collectibles are health and energy upgrades that increase Strider’s max health and energy.The enemies consist of troopers of different variations, some very basic, others carry shields that require more advanced moves to eliminate them. The enemies do become repetitive since they look the same and can respawn as you backtrack to some levels. The boss fights can be downright annoying, especially if you don’t learn each boss’ patterns. Every boss has a pattern of fighting, so you will have to go through several tries of button mashing to finally defeat a boss.  One boss fight includes 3 sexy females after fighting two of them in previous encounters.  Another includes a boss who uses water to attack you and you must learn how the pattern of water based attacks is used. Defense is very important in each boss fight. Too much offense and too little defense will get you killed without a doubt. The defense requires a number of keys to be pressed in order to avoid a boss’ attacks. These boss fights made me think that a gamepad might be better suited to fighting these bosses than the keyboard.The graphics are never bland and are always bright. Every level of Kazakh City is vibrant. Levels include an abandoned train station, a research facility, a military prison, and other diverse locales. Strider can eventually travel using an eagle perch, which looks beautiful when using it as a travel point. There’s also a panther statue that can be used to travel from one destination to another.Overall, I think Strider is a decent game that is a reminder of the arcade era of the 1980s. It can be frustrating to mash buttons in order to defeat tough bosses. I felt a sense of accomplishment when defeating these bosses, but I didn’t feel like I would like to fight them again for fun or replayability. The replay value I find in this game is the collectibles that are scattered throughout each level. It can be enjoyable if you’re looking for 1980s arcade fun and fast paced action platforming, but you should be aware of the frustration of pressing different buttons so quickly, so many times with the keyboard.

There's a red curcle thing you fill up by killing enemies and it supposedly does something but there's never enough things to kill to fill it up...played the game for awhile, you'd think it'd happen by now.

												---------choke me so I can't scream---------suits gathered around in noiseless processions, fury without form, matter without mind, shifted inside an ancient boardroom in search of the celibate. the aura of her areolas, broken blood vessels on her neck marked with remnants of predation. time like an ocean, decaying into instances, the things left unspoken the most important. in the terrible wet dream supernova of the summer, we were left impotent, and our fingers clutched remnants of hair on scalp.inside the consciousness of the continuity, set aside by those who knew and those who are known, and left for the buzzards on the third day of resurrection, I waited in the umbilical chamber. coagulated like venom in blood, and dissolved by the ticking of a stopwatch. someone bought a flimsy cure, and I resented him for it. motives into motives into motives into dreams, I caress the mark of my birth, and miss the cable.------------retire now to your tents and to your dreams------------for thine is the kingdom, the eternal winter sandcastle. in the divinity of the deity, in the shackles of the servants, in the mind of the mindless, fingers forming rings, rings forming spirals. spiralled forever into sleepy sadness, sickness of the silly, silence of the saints. in self abnigation, in momentos time worn, in old photographs that speak in languages now dead. who was alive, and what did they think? in the final grasping moments, we watch the sunset of man, with fingers locked into rings, watching for a ship of hands that we never reach for.

												At last a new Strider game!You'd think that would be a good thing but currently the situation isn't so clear. On one hand we have a great looking game, with a classic sounding musical score that manages to build on the excitement without getting in the way but on the other hand we have shoddy gameplay and repetitive, grating sound effects.Graphics first; the game looks good, kind of a mix of smoothly shaded 3D and comic book  style colourings and clean lines. However the graphics are often a source of frustration as doorways are obscured and background objects look like foreground objects and you go plummeting to your death even early in the game. Additionally the camera appears quite zoomed in, providing a very narrow field of view during normal gameplay to presumably show off the lovely model of Strider himself and the fantastic animation attached to every one of his movements but it's also frustrating because the camera angle is constantly shifting in and out as you enter and leave combat or jump around, causing missed jumps, mid-air uncertainty and worst of all - attacks that come from off-screen and are unavoidable.The audio is a similarly double-edged sword. While the music is perfectly complimentary to a Strider game and is comprised largely of easy to enjoy, exciting synthetic music that manages to stay in the background it's also party to the horrendously repetitive attack sounds and flat, unexciting gunfire sound that's spammed at you almost constantly by rooms of enemies (more on those later). Voice-overs are adequate if a bit cheesy, though the source material doesn't lend itself well to seriousness but the large neon orange box surrounding the portrait and subtitles of in-game announcements is an unforgivable screen-space hog especially when the camera is at its normal resting position where these subtitles can take up a full quarter of the screen and obscure what you're doing entirely - even worse is the fact that they happen in gameplay, hiding parts of breakable floor or vents and sometimes even enemies entering from the lower portion of the screen.The enemies are your typical Strider fare, robot soldiers by the dozen with assorted drones, turrets and traps mixed in. While the design is uninspired and bland the enemies themselves prove a challenge but not one that feels fair nor enjoyable half the time. A prime example of this is the fact that you cannot duck under enemy bullets as crouching causes them to aim slightly lower and still hit you with the final portion of their burst (standard enemies fire about 5 rounds per attack) and jumping over the shots often results in you getting another enemy on screen and getting hit by them, or caught in a crossfire and losing half your health before you can do anything about them.Drones commit one of the action game genres cardinal sins of being able to charge their attacks as they're entering from the foreground or background, meaning that they can fire a volley of shots on you as soon as they enter the gameplay plane, making it impossible to take them down before they get a chance to attack you and often extremely difficult to not get hit while trying to evade them.Turrets too are often mixed in with the drones and enemies, often in completely unfair numbers considering the amount of hits it takes to bring them down. Often when turrets are present amongst other groups the patterns of fire are a complete unnavigable mess, making the best tactic in some of these situations to just say ""screw it"" and charge the enemies head on with no care for your own health.Then we have the snipers who use the tried and true method of announcing their appearance with a red line (laser sight) between you and them, with their aim pausing just before they fire to give you time to dodge the coming attack. Sadly these attacks often come while you're flying through the air and end up being undodgable by everyone but those with sub-10 millisecond reflexes.While on the topic of enemies and unavoidable damage it's worth pointing out that almost every single room, rooftop and monkey-bar like girder is lined with little floating health boxes with a smattering of larger health packs usually floating higher up where a couple of jumps are required to break them but they feel like a crutch to the gameplay, rather than making the enemies fair, predicable and counterable they've just plastered the map with hundreds of healthpacks so you can (even on hard difficulty) ignore getting shot most of the time.It's also worth mentioning that, so far, I have found no way to counter or block enemy shots either.Then there's the heavy troopers, early in the game they come in two varieties, yellow and red. The red ones shoot napalm mortars while the yellow ones can launch their fists for a ranged attack. Both these mech-like enemies flash red and drop to a vulnerable state when heavily damaged but sometimes you can wail on them as much as you want (I actually took to using two fingers to tap the attack button as fast as possible during one of these encounters) and the enemy will just get back up, hitting you in the process. Reaction times are also an issue against these soldiers as they have one attack that's seemingly  telegraphed by only a couple of frames of animation before it triggers, giving you about a quarter-to-half a second to get out of the way which is almost impossible to dodge - at least it doesn't do much damage.Another peeve of mine is that while Strider is fast, agile and very responsive to control inputs there are a few flaws in the controls that are, again, frustrating. A missed jump that sees you latch onto a wall right below an electrified portion will often see you electrecuted for no apparent reason, even if you press away from the electric trap and Strider does a little knee-slide move when you crouch after running but the distance you have to move to trigger this small (about 2-3 feet distance) slide is seemingly arbitrary as I couldn't always get it to work.Another redundant control is the secondary attack (Y on the 360 pad) which sees Strider do a kind of feeble uppercut that's so delayed and lacking damage that it may as well just not be included as getting in close enough and pressing the button to use it will just prompt the standard soldiers to jab you with their bayonets every single time.That said, the primary attack has a generous range and a charge-up ability that doubles the range and damage and can be fired in 8 different directions even when clinging to walls and ceilings. The charge attack's increased range also allows it to pass through thin floors and ceilings, allowing you to strike at some enemies from complete safety.Strider is undeniably a Strider game, despite the new ""metroidvania"" style but where the originals were supremely difficult but fair this one feels artificially difficult and needlessly frustrating from multiple angles at once. The developers haven't got a lot wrong but what they did get wrong is the parts that should be polished to perfection (barring the repetitive sound effects, that's a whole other fine-line that's often sheer chance of whether you land on the right side or not). These small flaws sadly don't make Strider a slightly cloudy gem but instead feel like the turds in an otherwise excellent punchbowl.Further detracting from the appeal are throwbacks to the older games, such as scalable minarets and the Ouroboros boss at the end of the opening area which feel less like a fun homage and more like a tired rehash from developers too lazy, or cowardly to strike out on their own and design something new and awesome for the Strider-verse (is that even a thing?).So can I recommend Strider? Absolutely not. The PS2 versions remain the definitive home Strider experience for both new and old fans. Go play any of the older ones on NES, Genesis, TurboGrafx CD, Playstation or Playstation 2.Score: 5/10 mistakes were made.			"

												Do NOT buy this game if you are not one of those old♥♥♥♥♥dudes who played the original in arcades. It's clearly made for those fans, because there is NO story at all.Yep, NO story is ever told. They just show these cool-looking characters and pull up a splash screen with their name and a three-word description, then you get to fighting them.The game is also VERY VERY BORING. Literally it's just jumping and cutting. That's all you do. There are options for things like a strong downward slash, a kneeling slide, a double jump and summoning animals made of orange plasma, but you do not do any of that fluently in combat because it's impossible to chain combos or attacks. The game also develops slowly in terms of abilities and the same environments and enemies are kept around for too long. On top of that, none of the environments really look stellar. They don't all look the same but they all do look bland, with all of them having pale colours, grey steel and a few people in the background who don't react to you.All in all, the game severely lacks personality. It's the cookie cutter mold for Metroidvania games these days, without any innovations. Do not buy.			"

												Horrible remake, Double Helix just didn't understand the series and this was just another cheque for them to get paid.Dark background with barely anything visible, almost no background music(and the one you hear is meh), cheesy voice acting(zero effert put in that), repetitive boring enemies, unresponsive gameplay, boring level environment and the one that takes the cake is forcing you to play on a analog stick.The gameplay mechanics in this game is locked, and you need to unlock it as you play through this bland game, I hate it when Devs take away all the fun gameplay mechanics  only to get them back at the very end of the game, making the beginin of the game feel incomplete until the very end, even then game feels unfinished with it's boss fights having only 3 or 4 moves and no flashy animation, the game tries to make you feel your are progressing but you really aren't.Double Helix is a prime exmple of why alot of westren devs don't understand Japanese games and try to change them thinking it would look better if looked more westren like(and I am pretty sure Capcom asked them to do this).Do yourself a favor and play Strider 2 on the PSX classics, the devs on that game knew what people liked about the original, knew what to improve, what to change, what not to change, making sure the game is as crazy a the original was and never tried to take it too sriously.

												Well, I finished it, but I'm not sure that I really enjoyed it. I kept getting stuck to walls, the weapons don't feel all that punchy and powerful, and bloody hell, the enemies have no qualms about stunlocking you, especially once they have the freeze guns. A lack of savepoints in the final ascent is also aggravating. Fortunately the last boss itself isn't too punishing. But, now that I'm done, I don't really care, and frankly I nearly gave up before I was done. Recommended if you reallllly want a Metroidvania Strider in your life, but there are better options.			"

												I'm not super big on 2.5D games, but this one seemed interesting, and I was in the mood for some hack and slash. The keyboard controls take some getting used to, but gamepad controls are more fluid.Combat is kinda clunky from the word go, and while it isn't exactly un-fun, without a storyline to propel the game I can't play it for very long at all.All in all, if it comes down in price, it might be worth it.

												Where do i start with this atrocious peice of c rap.1. next gen visuals, but looks like a it was thrown together using an asset store2. cool ninja, but same animations over and over and this ninja can only run, jump, attack and slide3. lost of enemies, but they all die with 2 hits 4. enemies arent' overpowered, they wait around to be slaughtered or follow trite patterns5. its a remake of a classic game, original was better.this game is horrible, i've played mobile games that are more fun than this t urd.since i got it as part of a humble bundle i don't mind that it sucks really bad, but i wouldn't pay more than $3 for it.

												After spending over ten hours of having tons of fun, you hit the Research Facility and every enemy hit interrupts your actions and you become incapable of doing anything but bounce between laser beams and die. The difficulty goes from fun/challenging to impossible/effyou. So I've wasted all those hours to end up unable to finish the game and rage-quitting.If you don't mind not finishing a game, go ahead, it's a lot of fun. If not, you'll want to hit someone in the face when you hit the last area.			"

												Fantastic reboot! I was hoping Double Helix wouldn't screw this game up and I wasn't disappointed at all. I loved Strider 2 on PS1 back in the day and this reboot does the series justice! It feels like a mix between Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Mega Man X but still has the feel of Strider. This game for being only $15 packs a whole lot of collectables and content which is a huge plus. It's fun, fast paced arcade style action at it's best and anyone who wants a game to kill a few hours, get this one, you won't regret it.Fans of Strider will feel right at home, and even newcomers will have a great time playing through this game, you can beat this game in about 4 hours but with all the collectables you'll probably get at least 7, well worth it for a $15 dollar game! Honestly if you want this game, if the trailer looks good to you, if the things I'm saying in this review convinced you....BUY THIS GAME! You will not regret it. The gameplay is solid, the bosses are challenging but fun, and the soundtrack is great! :)-On a side note- There's a few glitches they need to iron out, for example; I fell through the floor and was able to traverse through part of the map on inside the walls and was able to skip a chunk of obstacles getting to my next destination but that's all trivial stuff that can be fixed, so I won't fault the developers for it. All in all I thought the game was damn near perfect in every way, if you haven't already, buy this game especially if you played Strider before, this reboot does the series justice and I'm hoping there's more of this series to come in the future. I give it a 9.5/10!			"

												I'm a little torn on this one. On the one hand I enjoyed the game, on the other I know that it isn't all that great. The gameplay is fun as long as you keep moving forward. The second you start slowing down and exploring it becomes painfully obvious just how repetitive it can be. The plot is... well the plot is pretty bad to be honest. I'm not sure why Strider needs to do what he does, and I don't know why the villians hate him so much. It's just bad writing through and through. When I kept myself moving though I remembered why I enjoy this game though. When the action is fast paced it is a blast. The best time I had playing this was the couple hours I spent on my speed run. If you're looking for something fast paced that doesn't require much thought this is a good game. One other thing worth noting though is that if you're looking for a difficult game this isn't that game by any stretch of the imagination. Hard mode is what normal mode should have been. It is only truly difficult in maybe three spots. I never played easy mode, but I imagine that it might as well just be a self playing movie at that point.			"

												When I was first gifted this game, It was sad that in order to play it, I'd need the x64 version of my OS to install and play it. I spent the whole day installing the x64 OS, and all of my programs I use. I couldn't believe that I had to go through all that trouble JUST TO PLAY THIS ONE GAME........and in the end, it was so WORTH IT.Strider is just stunning! The graphics are just wonderful, and are well-rendered. It's a fast-pased game, with great visiuals - it has to run on a 64-bit system. The controls and Gameplay are tight, you can move in strider with razor-sharp accuracy. If you make a wrong more, it your fault, not the game mechanics.Every stage is challenging and vast - lots of puzzles and hurdles to overcome and solve, and a lot of goodies to find as well.Don't let the price tag, or the system requirements scare you off - in the end, it's pays off, big time.

												An extremely enjoyable retro platformer, however be warned that as you get into the second half the game begins to collapse under the weight of all the new abilities thrown at you, confusing the initially clean and simple combat. In particular, using the D-pad to switch between 4 different sword types in the midst of combat never really feels anything but messy. However I am a sucker for minimalist design, and while this feels a little bloated with features to me, for the most part it is still a very well-designed game that I can't imagine many people won't enjoy			"

												I only half mean that 'not recommended' thingthe game's great and all but it has an abnormally high graphics demand and no real graphics settings, and the way it handles that is to slow the game down so it can take more time to do things, usually at half speed (vsync'd, 30 effective FPS instead of 60)upgrade scenes didn't help for me either, they can't be skipped and happen frequently, and they're all the exact same ""you got a thing"" animation, which makes the game feel much slower paced than it shouldran into a bug here and there that forced game restarts back to checkpoints, typically character spawning somewhere they aren't allowed to be, but they tended to go away after the first restartif your computer can run a couple other modern games at once without issue you might be okay, and if you can't then you may still be able to run it at it's halved speed, but the lack of settings to fix the slow pace wasn't enjoyable for me			"

												""You'll wind up with your teeth all grey!""Seriously though, great game, but um, guys, coulda put like $100 and half a day into the end sequence, y'know?Captures the 90's feel well, without leaning on the 90's aesthetic, which is, in this industry, a welcome approach.Great dynamic gameplay, you really feel like some kind of super-ninja flicking through the air - even on the PC, where the controls are completely messed up if you're in a no-grav/object-gravity area. Probably worth using a controller with this one.By the time you get to the end on normal difficulty, you realise a lot of the game is just button-mashing with your special abilities to get past the harder opponents, really brute-force, but there is some elegance to it.The exploration is the best part of the game - it rewards it, and it's pretty much how you get more powerful, rather than simply following the provided pathways. There were a few areas I couldn't figure out, but still.It's unfortunate that the ending didn't live up to the game. I mean, the last boss is  hard (not super-hard - like, not cave-story-hard), and even a 20 second end sequence would've been enough. But no. Straight to credits.			"

												This is a 2D Side Scrolling Metroidvania-light with extensive melee combat, and a little bit of backtracking. The combat options are surprisingly deep, and the character is fairly acrobatic, leading to lots of off-the-main road explorations.  Boss battles are challenging but fair (although there was one near the end I really had trouble with), and there's enough reward for going back through the earlier levels that I added probably two hours to my game time backtracking (and still only ended with 85% completion). The story is really slight, but that isn't the point of the game. There are some issues (only one save slot, and you can't go back to explore more after finishing the game; travel between sections for backtracking takes a lot more work than it should), but overall it's a fun, challenging action adventure.

												An average metroid-vania game with a hack-n-slash focus. While the combat is fun and frantic, it requires little finesse: Most rooms will be cleared with the same combination of abilities. Player upgrades are a little disappointing, and short of the first few, they have minimal effect on the way you play the game.Visuals are great, using the 3D side-on environment to great effect. The story and world had potential, but too many key figures follow the evil villain stereotype to be taken seriously.If this style of game is your cup of tea, then I'd happily recommend it, but only after you first look into Shadow Complex.[7.0]			"

												I'll never forget the first time I saw Strider in the Arcade, I was blown away (The visuals! The sounds!! The bosses!!!) It was like a magnet for my Alladdin's Castle Tokens...Fast forward to the announcement of an NES version of the game...I was super psyched (hmm...these screenshots aren't quite what I'm expecting...). Now fast forward again to the release of the NES game (What is this...it's nothing like the Arcade?!), then suddenly (Wait a minute, this is pretty cool...), and finally (This is one of the greatest NES games ever!!!)Several years later I became the unfortunate owner of the Turd known as ""Strider 2"" by US GOLD for the Amiga. I couldn't resist when I saw the box at the store (Strider 2, are you kidding me!). The excitement only lasted a few short seconds...(Looks kind of like Strider, Sounds kind of like Strider...wait...did I just morph into a robot with tank treads for feet?!?! What the hell is this garbage!). It was so bad I had repressed the memory, only to have it crawl from the stinky depths while writing this review. US GOLD were The Masters of Dissapointment...Sh@tting all over some of my favorite franchises.Strider 2 on PS1 (alright, now we're back in business!) was pretty solid, and although didn't quite have that magic that I had found in the original Arcade or NES game, it was another good Strider game (nothing wrong with that!).Over the last 14 years, Hiryu would occasionally appear in Capcom games as an extra or playable charachter and this gave me some hope that they hadn't forgotten about one of my favorites.There was also Moon Diver on XBLA that was very ""Stider-esque"" and I believe was made by some former capcom employees, and that was decent...Then came the announcement of this game...Initially I was excited, but apprehensive (what if it's not good...) so for some reason I held off. After hearing a friend mention how much he liked the new game, I decided it was time to give it a shot. In short, I love this game! It's like a delicious combo platter of the Original 2 (arcade & NES) Strider games, with chunky bits of strider 2 mixed in, all served up on a tasty Metroidvania platter. The graphics are great, the Sound is great, the controls are great (xb360 controller), there's lots to see and do, plenty of abilities and secrets to find, and there are some epic boss battles.  What more could I ask for? Not much...If you like a good MetroidVania game, you'll like this. If you like a good Metroidvania game, and you like Strider, chances are you'll love this as much as I do.			"

												Amazing, well planned and constructed maps; very visually appealing.  My only issue is with the play controls - I was expecting a loose control scheme, but was given a reactive-type instead.For example:When Strider gets close to a wall in midair, he reacts by grabbing onto the wall with his ninja tools.When Strider attacks an enemy with a shield, the game reacts by slowing the game for effect while his weapon bounces off the shield and stuns him.When Strider is struck in midair with practially anything, he reacts by falling to the ground and won't react until you've tried to jump several times.When Strider stands on a gravity globe, the controls react depending on which side of the globe you're on and you have to change which direction to hold on the control stick in order to keep moving.  This is especially frustrating during the final boss fight in which not only are you jumping from gravity globe to gravity globe but you're dodging seemingly random attacks that all stun on impact whether you're airborne or not.The game is great for what it is, but don't pick it up expecting a Metroidvania game - it's more a ninja-action game, which is really quite fitting the character and series.

												The best way I can explain this game is the crazy Ninja stuff from Ninja Gaiden & Dynasty Warriors with the Platforming elements of Super Metriod.If you like the sound of that then, pick up STRIDER because its just that.The enemy scaling needs some work; at the start they can kill you quickly if you're not careful but they can also die just as fast but about 4 hours in it starts to balance up but every thing now becomes a painstaking one button Hold or Tap.also i have a feeling its just me but, if you have a GTX 770, DON'T DSR on this game, it just crashes when you die.BUT OTHER THAN THAT...I LOVE THIS GAME, you can easily spend a few hours before you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at dying in the same section of enemy.It's fluid game and a beautiful game minus those STUPID FAKE SCAN LINES, but I guess it's trying to go for a flamboyant 80s look and some of the faces have NO animations? it's a bit creepy			"

Full of bugs and only plays on 64bits for a MARIO platform.If it is not your Windows is your graphic card and if thats not it then it is your sound that fails. Buy it when it is 1 Euro or get it for free from the comunnity market. A big dissapointment from CAPCOM #HIREGAMETESTERSFFS			"

												As far as I know, Strider was not a particularly commonly known franchise, which is a shame given how awesome the 2014 version is. This is speaking as someone who only has ever played the NES version, which despite being okay, wasn't the greatest game to hit the market. However, this one far exceeded any expectations I had.You are Strider Hiryu, your job is to kill Grandmaster Meio, but obviously no game could be as simple as THAT...and for good reason because Hiryu is a total badass and it's a pleasure to play longer just so you can kick serious heiney. It's a very action oriented game since you run, jump, and just generally hack anything that moves to death with Hiryu's Cypher, which apparently is some kind of tonfa-sword combo that can be powered with various plasma types. The game can probably best be described as a Metroidvania for those of you who know what that is. Hiryu must overcome various obstacles by searching out new weapons, abilities, and such to make it all around Meio's city.And that's where the game has me for sure. If you're the kind of person who loves adventuring all about, having to know what's around every corner, and getting a little excited when you find a new power-up that will let you be even MORE of a badass ninja than you already are, then yes, definitely a game to consider getting. I'm currently not finished with the game, but I've logged a number of hours already and the game say's I'm only about 60% of the way through.If there is one complaint to be had, I'll say that for normal difficulty, it seems particularly easy. Though I've done quite well at finding all the HP Upgrades, Hiryu doesn't take all too much damage unless you're standing around LETTING him get shot. If anything, the worst I've faced is when Hiryu falls into a trap and disappears and respawns on solid safe ground, which is more of an irritant than a real danger. Perhaps a harder difficulty on a later playthrough will give a bit more challenge, or possibly the game itself will bare its fangs when I get closer to the end.Overall, I'd say it's a solid game and I'm quite often finding it difficult to hit the Exit option when I really need to stop playing :D			"

												Strider is an amazing platformer based on a futuristic ninja (Hiryu) carrying out tasks as being in the strongest ninja class in the  Strider program/clan. It's very fun with the amount of exploration, unlockables, new powers (you can unlock powers in-game), etc. The only downsides are a glich at the first boss (not all the time), and that it isn't multiplayer (can't complain on that too much).

												""You'll wind up with your teeth all grey!""Seriously though, great game, but um, guys, coulda put like $100 and half a day into the end sequence, y'know?Captures the 90's feel well, without leaning on the 90's aesthetic, which is, in this industry, a welcome approach.Great dynamic gameplay, you really feel like some kind of super-ninja flicking through the air - even on the PC, where the controls are completely messed up if you're in a no-grav/object-gravity area. Probably worth using a controller with this one.By the time you get to the end on normal difficulty, you realise a lot of the game is just button-mashing with your special abilities to get past the harder opponents, really brute-force, but there is some elegance to it.The exploration is the best part of the game - it rewards it, and it's pretty much how you get more powerful, rather than simply following the provided pathways. There were a few areas I couldn't figure out, but still.It's unfortunate that the ending didn't live up to the game. I mean, the last boss is  hard (not super-hard - like, not cave-story-hard), and even a 20 second end sequence would've been enough. But no. Straight to credits.			"

												This is a 2D Side Scrolling Metroidvania-light with extensive melee combat, and a little bit of backtracking. The combat options are surprisingly deep, and the character is fairly acrobatic, leading to lots of off-the-main road explorations.  Boss battles are challenging but fair (although there was one near the end I really had trouble with), and there's enough reward for going back through the earlier levels that I added probably two hours to my game time backtracking (and still only ended with 85% completion). The story is really slight, but that isn't the point of the game. There are some issues (only one save slot, and you can't go back to explore more after finishing the game; travel between sections for backtracking takes a lot more work than it should), but overall it's a fun, challenging action adventure.

												Fantastic reboot! I was hoping Double Helix wouldn't screw this game up and I wasn't disappointed at all. I loved Strider 2 on PS1 back in the day and this reboot does the series justice! It feels like a mix between Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Mega Man X but still has the feel of Strider. This game for being only $15 packs a whole lot of collectables and content which is a huge plus. It's fun, fast paced arcade style action at it's best and anyone who wants a game to kill a few hours, get this one, you won't regret it.Fans of Strider will feel right at home, and even newcomers will have a great time playing through this game, you can beat this game in about 4 hours but with all the collectables you'll probably get at least 7, well worth it for a $15 dollar game! Honestly if you want this game, if the trailer looks good to you, if the things I'm saying in this review convinced you....BUY THIS GAME! You will not regret it. The gameplay is solid, the bosses are challenging but fun, and the soundtrack is great! :)-On a side note- There's a few glitches they need to iron out, for example; I fell through the floor and was able to traverse through part of the map on inside the walls and was able to skip a chunk of obstacles getting to my next destination but that's all trivial stuff that can be fixed, so I won't fault the developers for it. All in all I thought the game was damn near perfect in every way, if you haven't already, buy this game especially if you played Strider before, this reboot does the series justice and I'm hoping there's more of this series to come in the future. I give it a 9.5/10!			"

												I'm a little torn on this one. On the one hand I enjoyed the game, on the other I know that it isn't all that great. The gameplay is fun as long as you keep moving forward. The second you start slowing down and exploring it becomes painfully obvious just how repetitive it can be. The plot is... well the plot is pretty bad to be honest. I'm not sure why Strider needs to do what he does, and I don't know why the villians hate him so much. It's just bad writing through and through. When I kept myself moving though I remembered why I enjoy this game though. When the action is fast paced it is a blast. The best time I had playing this was the couple hours I spent on my speed run. If you're looking for something fast paced that doesn't require much thought this is a good game. One other thing worth noting though is that if you're looking for a difficult game this isn't that game by any stretch of the imagination. Hard mode is what normal mode should have been. It is only truly difficult in maybe three spots. I never played easy mode, but I imagine that it might as well just be a self playing movie at that point.			"

Pros:+ Very tight and solid mechanics~ The game is very fluid and natural. Has very satisfying feedback and feel when attacking and moving. Hiryu will attack as fast as you mash the button and mechanics like fast falling when pressing down in the air plus a brisk pace makes this feel great. The combat also feels solid with flashy and satisfying visual feedback when attacking enemies with sparks and bright colors flying everywhere.+ Fast progression~ You never feel like a segment is dragged out as you will constantly be unlocking power-ups. You also feel like a powered up badass if you decide to backtrack for collectibles with your upgrades in places you got your♥♥♥♥♥handed to before.+ Tons of bosses and unlockables~ If you like Metroidvania/Metroid-like games with a tons of bosses and unlockables, then this game will satisfy that desire. The actual upgrade collectibles are a small amount but you can unlock stuff like concept art, story info, and alternate skins/costumes.+ Heavily inspired by Super Metroid in game design and progression, while keeping the feeling of being a badass ninja+ Excellent mix of platforming and action~ If you like platforming segments ontop of your action, this game has it in spades. Thankfully they aren't too tedious or challenging minus maybe one or two segments.+ Old school game with shiny graphicsCons:- Difficulty all over the place in boss battles~ I played on hard, and playing the game and getting around areas never felt too difficult minus a few areas. The boss battles aren't very difficult until the latter half of the game, where the order of their patterns gets faster, more intense, and randomized. However, they do the same attack patterns even if they are out of order, so that helps a lot I guess- Backtracking for upgrades and collectibles is time consuming due to lack of good overworld design/fast travel points~ it's not too bad as there are fast travel points but it could be way better in terms of placement and where they take you- Unbalanced sound designThe music isn't bad and actually fits the game pretty well, but it's nothing you'll be humming to any time soon. It is the lack of sound balance when fast traveling and attacking that puts this as a con. I put the volume up on my headphones because the base game was kind of quiet, but when you fast travel and attack it's like you're getting stabbed in your eardrums with sudden intense loud sound. TL;DRThis game is an old school action/platformer made in the vein of Super Metroid/Metroidvanias. You feel like a badass ninja with tight mechanics and feedback. If you're one of those ""muh story and presentation"" people when it comes to games, look elsewhere. If you want a good action sidescroller Metroid like game, play this right now; it's definitely one of the better options available.			"

												Strider pays homage to the classic side-scrolling action games of past, but with modern day conveniences (like no limit of retries, save files and checkpoints). This game has lots of fighting, lots of enemies, and a steadily increasing repetoire of abilities to use throughout. The game is fast-paced, and it always feels challenging but never unfair.If you want a quick romp through nostalgic gameplay, but without the headache of actually playing those old games that probably suck by today's standards, Strider is a good one to play.7/10 ""Good""			"

The Pros are broad and the Cons are narrow for a reason.Pros: Beautiful, lovely world design (very Einhander-esque) with a strong score and tight controls.  Cons: For as pretty as it is, I was a little bored after awhile; I never learned who the character was or why he was doing what he was doing.  The entire game is In Media Res which gets old after a half-dozen hours of Fighting the Good Fight.  The automated annoucements that provide strong atmosphere at first get incredibly repetitive after a short time.Rating: **** / *****			"

The boss battles aren't very difficult until the latter half of the game, where the order of their patterns gets faster, more intense, and randomized. However, they do the same attack patterns even if they are out of order, so that helps a lot I guess- Backtracking for upgrades and collectibles is time consuming due to lack of good overworld design/fast travel points~ it's not too bad as there are fast travel points but it could be way better in terms of placement and where they take you- Unbalanced sound designThe music isn't bad and actually fits the game pretty well, but it's nothing you'll be humming to any time soon. It is the lack of sound balance when fast traveling and attacking that puts this as a con. I put the volume up on my headphones because the base game was kind of quiet, but when you fast travel and attack it's like you're getting stabbed in your eardrums with sudden intense loud sound. TL;DRThis game is an old school action/platformer made in the vein of Super Metroid/Metroidvanias. You feel like a badass ninja with tight mechanics and feedback. If you're one of those ""muh story and presentation"" people when it comes to games, look elsewhere. If you want a good action sidescroller Metroid like game, play this right now; it's definitely one of the better options available.			"

												I always had a soft spot for the original arcade game, so I was pleased to see they were remaking it. The remake lacks some of the oddball charm of the original and has less variety in its environments, but it's a solid enough run-and-gun with lots of nods to its predecessors but not to the point of being confusing for new players. I played it to completion and had a good time with it. Expect to spend between 6 and 12 hours if you want to explore every nook and cranny and get all the hidden goodies (a mix of in-game powerups and extras like concept art).			"

												Fantastic action sidescroller, with very light Metroidvania style.

												Overall: Strong exploration/action game.  Simple, effective.  The Pros are broad and the Cons are narrow for a reason.Pros: Beautiful, lovely world design (very Einhander-esque) with a strong score and tight controls.  Cons: For as pretty as it is, I was a little bored after awhile; I never learned who the character was or why he was doing what he was doing.  The entire game is In Media Res which gets old after a half-dozen hours of Fighting the Good Fight.  The automated annoucements that provide strong atmosphere at first get incredibly repetitive after a short time.Rating: **** / *****			"

												Strider was a very fun and enjoyable action side scroller. Filled with beautiful lighting and fast paced fights, it reminded me of the old days of NES and SNES titles like Metroid and Megaman, along with the (of course) previous installments in the Strider franchise. (Which I have not yet gotten a chance to try personally.) I encourage the use of a controller with this game, but those on the keyboard should be able to manage.Liked:-Fun-Fast-Fluid-Metroidvania-Level design (in general*)Disliked:-Stun locks-Poorly designed invisible walls*-Unengaging story-Questionable voice acting-Anti-climatic ending-Saving at the end of the game stops you from going back and collecting everything. Is an option not to save however. (Awesome reward for beating the final boss... /sarcasm)Overall Score: 6/10			"

												This is a reimagining of the old Strider games, and it has the same basic concept - cyborg ninja fights the evil forces of Cold War-esque dictator Grandmaster Meio by slashing baddies with his cypher and running/flipping/climbing on walls with sickles and a robot panther and falcon. That's a pretty loaded sentence and if you thought ""wow, that sounds awesome!"" then this is the game for you. The graphics are very gorgeous and gameplay is generally fast and furious if your computer can handle it; I had to turn down the resolution quite a bit and there was still lots of slowdown, though it was certainly cinematic at times with Strider dodging bullets in slow-mo like an uber boss.Structurally the game differs from past Striders (except for the NES game) by taking on a Metroidvania format - you run around sections of a big map collecting abilities and fighting bosses in order to unlock access to new areas. Nothing wrong with that, I love Metroidvanias - but Strider 2014 does feel padded at times even though it's not a really long game. Certain sections drag and the map feels overly big and occasionally confusing thanks to different ""planes"" that don't really make much sense. I never felt the need to run around and explore every nook and cranny or snag every ability, which is really a first for me in a Metroidvania game. Aside from some dullness that will likely keep me from replaying this anytime soon, Strider 2014 is worth it if the idea of communist-fighting ninjas appeals to you or if you're a fan of the older games. At its best, it's full of nostalgia with old bosses like the Pooh Sisters and the robot gorilla all present and accounted for. Also the NES Strider theme plays in the background sometimes and really got me pumped more than once, so I guess that was worth the price of admission.			"

												Strider is a sidescrolling hack-and-slash platformer with a Metroid-like backtracking with powerups aspect. It’s a nice game. I personally prefer to play button mashing sort of games with a controller, but the keyboard control scheme is alright.If I were to complain, it would be that the “fast travel” system later on in the game is limited and has no labels. You’re guessing where a point takes you to until you remember, and sometimes you have to walk to the place you want to go anyway.Normal and Easy mode are where the game feels really smooth, and you slice through things like butter, and it feels really neat. Hard mode is if you want to have a little challenge. "

												Strider is a patron saint of the 2D arcade pantheon, that I have a little shrine to in my heart. If you remember how awesome the attract mode of the original looked back in '88, then you know how awesome this game will make you feel.Fluid physics; graceful controls. The best Sci-Fi Metroidvania since Shadow Complex. I was deeply skeptical of this game, and it proved me wrong again and again. The swordplay is like a blend of SOTN and MMX - this is an incredible achievement. Well played, Capcom. For the first time in a decade, well played. High points: deflecting almost anything with a plasma sword. Dashing through enemies to cause explosions. Sending explosive kunai into mechs. Listening to the excellent effects work, and noticing callbacks to twenty years of gaming. Riding a holographic plasma panther.10/10, would buy again at full price.			"

The problems I have with the game stem mostly from the progression (it felt somewhat open worldly, but it couldn't quite commit) and there are times where I feel like some bosses, stages, enemies, and parts were put in the game purely for padding to make it longer. That said, I quite enjoyed my experience and if anything, the combat in this game is really.♥♥♥♥ing.awesome!			"

												This game.... I love this game. On normal difficulty it's just fun to blaze through the enemies and destroy everything in your path. This is being overpowered done right. On hard there is definitely a challenge, but is just as fun. Strider is actually really really pretty. The backgrounds are layered perfectly and give a feel that you're really tearing up a dystopian city. This game always has another trick up it's sleeve, I'm five hours in and STILL don't have most of the upgrades with a lot of locations still blocked off. Yeah, the scripting isn't that great and the story doesn't really exist, but that's not the point. The villians, the gameplay, the asthetics, and the visuals all come together to make this an amazing sidescroller, one of the best in the past few years			"

												I may not be the best person to review a game such as this, as I have never been the best at platformers. But, I do believe in a gradual scale of difficulty. Within 5 minutes, I basically hit a brick wall, as I had enemies thrown at me left and right and kept getting killed in the same spot. I know a lot of people look for the ""NES"" level of difficulty, but I'm not. If you can get past the difficulty, the game looks and plays beautifully. The controls are great and it feels true to its successor, which I have beating by the way. So, I'm not looking for an NES hard game-I grew up with the NES and remember how difficult it was. I'm looking for something with reasonable challange and a good story. This may be your cup of tea and definetly worth a look at.			"

												Quick paced and fun combat. Quite reminscient of the other Strider games.Not crazily difficult, although I'm halfway through on Normal difficulty, but I've had a few deaths along the way.Pleasantly happy with the combat style, powerups, and ways of battling the enemies.Storyline doesn't bog down combat. And if you want to learn more of the story you can view the intel from the extras menu as you find them.A controller is very useful and highly recommended.Kudos for remixing the NES music for some of the battles.Cons:The other outfits you unlock are just palette swaps (so far to what I've found). Would've liked a few other perks and challenges associated with them.Finding secrets is kinda easy with the on screen map. You see an icon and you kinda have an idea how to get it.Some of the more fun bosses die quickly.Killing most enemies give health to make the game seem kind-of easy at times.			"

												Strider is a painfully average game. It plays competently, but without an ounce of polish. Boss and platforming sections are the main highlights as there are very few regular enemy types and even fewer ways to combat them. Upgrades are scattered throughout levels to encourage exploration, though most upgrades either increase passive states or change the color of your weapon without doing much to change how you use them. Overall a fun, but brief game that you can play for 5-10 hours, then move on to something else. Overall worth about $5 to play.			"

Everything from the the power ups to the enemies to the bosses is super high octane fun. its not one of those games where ou get a power up for a specific level then never use it again. Your always swapping and youll always have that favourite that becomes your new default.  But its not perfect. For some reason the devs felt the need to kinda disregard everything you learn through out the game for the final boss. Where its this upside down confusing mess with more or less gimiky controls. As well as if your not a fan of new game + make a second save when you get to the final boss because the game will remove everything including items collected.			"

												Well executed open world feel makes this Strider game feel great. The controls are tight and responsive and there are plenty of moves and combinations to master. Strider feels fluid, powerful, and is a lot of fun to control. The visuals, sound, and art style are all solid and work together well.There are a lot of secrets to find if you like exploring, but many of them take the form of ""you can't get here until you learn move XYZ 2 levels later"" so you'll end up back tracking a lot if you want to find everything. I didn't bother.I beat the game in 4:40 minutes with 45% ""completion"" rate, so the length isn't too long. If you try to get full completion though it will take you much longer. There are also challenges that you can do for more replay value.One big gripe: the game will decide to use one controller randomly without any in game option to select which controller to use. If you have multiple controllers, this is a pain. In order to get the controller you want, you have to manually edit a settings file in the game's directory. Weak.			"

												It feels silly for the player to be shot by someone off the screen because the view is so zoomed in (with no control over zoom by player input).  It also seems odd to make the player repeat almost an entire level just because they don't one-shot the first boss.  It was interesting and refreshing to quickly hack and slash, but with the bad view and complete lack of manual save (or reasonably placed checkpoints), it can become frustrating and especially tedious (through repetition).

												As someone who played the first Strider game on Sega Genesis, I can say this game is truly perfect. It starts with the modified version of the same music and cutscene that plays in the beginning of the first Strider. However, It's A LOT EASIER than the first game which I don't consider it a really bad thing. At least you can finish the game!Also, to be honest, I had a lot of fun playing this game; Just run and slash everything that stands in your way.If you like fast platforming games, I think you really need to try this game, And probably you will not be disappointed.

												Now I know who that guy from Marvel Vs. Capcom is. A pretty decent Metroidvania. Smooth graphics. Awesome upgrades. NIce aesthetic. The story is so awful I wonder if it was intentional. The problems I have with the game stem mostly from the progression (it felt somewhat open worldly, but it couldn't quite commit) and there are times where I feel like some bosses, stages, enemies, and parts were put in the game purely for padding to make it longer. That said, I quite enjoyed my experience and if anything, the combat in this game is really.♥♥♥♥ing.awesome!			"

												The game is a great 2.5D metroidvania type game. It's pretty similar to Shadow Complex, except its main weapon is a sword and the main character has a climbing hook they can use to climb underneath things and up walls. With amazing art design and great music, the game revives the Strider IP with a bang and suceeds in making him into a real icon in Capcom's collection (although they don't seem to care very much about icons lately).The only negatives are that the game is beset by some glitches. The fullscreen mode for example is bugged to the point of being broken and causes random crashes, so it is recommended to play in Fullscreen Windowed instead. In addition the game will freeze if the controller is turned on after the game starts.The game's lack of many fast travel points can also be somewhat annoying when you are searching for upgrades or pickups.

												Absolutely essential for every Strider fan.I can't believe I waited until the last Steam Sale to buy this game.  The last time I had played ""Strider"" was on the Sega Genesis. It was good fun back then and I remember my times with the game fondly.  - This new Strider game absolutely nails it. It is exactly what I would have hope for from a modern remake of the game. - Graphics / artstyle absolutely beautiful in motion. Especially the particle effects and reflections- Quick responsive controls - Wonderful soundtrack with plenty of cues that send you right back to your Sega Genesis era.The combat and platforming are fun. Nothing groundbreaking but completely in line with what you'd expect from Strider. On top of that the devs have innovated just enough to make the game feel fresh.  Awesome, awesome game. I suddenly find my self wanting more games like this. Damn I suddenly wish someone would remake the Star Wars games from the SNES.  *sigh*			"

												While I did enjoy this game, it comes with a few things that to me felt like grievous issues.Cons:Camera - The camera is almsot always fine, but in a few boss fights it zooms in and out at horrible times and pulls away from the boss to follow Strider.  It's even worse around gravity globes you can run on, which are their own irritating issue that just becomes more annoying.No invincibility frames - A few normal enemies and a few boss attacks have their entire gimmick around this and squeezing as much damage as possible in one volley or chain stuns.  Easily a quarter or more of a fully upgraded health from one of those, or just getting pinballed between 2-4 enemies for a few seconds while you wait for the chance to have control again.Other smaller issues involve the final tower level being a boring difficulty spike and that wall climbing has you suddenly mantle up and over from a bit too generous of a distance.  Also there's an entire level where you run against the wind meaning you walk slow and jump short distances; meh.The Good:Movement is amazing.  Running, dashing, jumping, and sliding around while slashing everything in sight is solid and the best part of the game.  Worth a playthrough alone just to hop around and hit stuff really.The Metroidvaia aspect feels tacked on with four flavors (ice, fire, reflect, magnetic/ranged) to the dash, slash, and kunais, but overall is fun while you do a little backtracking here and there and have a dramatic pose animation that plays each time you pick up an upgrade.  Also ignore the story.  Not because the story is really bad, but because it's just in the way of the fun and makes deaths to bosses involve watching another boring taunt speech.For all of the negatives, I do still recommend this game oddly.  It's that much fun to play when the quirks aren't getting in your face.			"

												Fun hack and slash. There are bosses, power ups, and strider. When I played it, it was like playing megaman but with strider instead of X. It is a shame that there is no difficulties as it would be fun to play on a mode where you could get shot down very quickly, strider has the ability for every situtation, be it reflectin bullets or dodging them for the most simple examples.The different power ups in this game add more variety to his default attacks with elements which is nice. Can't say no to exploding kunai. If you like hack and slash side scrollers, this could be for you.			"

They have many similarities in gamplay.Quick side-scrolling action and unlockables and new things are added into the gameplay to keep things fresh. Although, I do wish there should have been a way to do jumping up and down slashes more consistently. Maybe it was my controller but I ended up doing things I didn't want to do, but I got used to it. Definately hope this spawns more games where it can be polished more.			"

												As of: 01/18/15Great homage to the original title.Gameplay is fast and fluid. Strider's controls are intuitive and fun to use as you rip your way through enemies as the unstoppable force you are.My only complaint so far is that the characters do not move their mouths or have almost any sort of facial expression when they talk - unsure if this was done intentionally - however, it does dampen the experience slightly.No matter, as the cut scenes are quick to pass and you're back into the action.I rate it 9/10. Should you buy at full price or wait for it to go on sale? I say you could wait for a sale - but it's definitely worth full price if you decide you can't wait.			"

												On the whole Strider is a decently fun game. Whether it's ""good"" or not is more up to your personal tastes and tolerances. The game is a Metroidvania style action platformer with all the standards of backtracking once you find new power-ups and such. This is where the game excels, the areas are mostly well designed and you rarely scratch your head as to what you need to progress or get a power-up you see currently out of reach. The combat is very simple and actiony, with one primary attack augmented by your current Plasma power setting, a secondary attack which is rarely useful outside of it's special button combo uses (use as down-special in the air), three unlockable energy consuming specials which are of varying degrees of use as they are highly specialized, and later a dash attack which you will then spam like a crazy person.So where is the rub? The voice work is atrocious, the story is completely insipid and you will never care about it. The game isn't exceedingly long which can be viewed as good since when you reach final area it locks you out of hunting specials and when you beat the game you cannot go looking again for completion. But the two biggest complaints, and why I almost don't recommend this game are such: the controls for the gravity sections (including final boss) are godawful to the point of frustration, and there are no invincibility frames. Your controls on the gravity balls section ""try"" to compensate for constantly changing orientation but instead ♥♥♥♥ everything up and make it work. And the lack of invincibility frames in a game like this with so many projectiles and high damage attacks means you can, AND WILL, get stunlocked to death sometimes and certain attacks will do far more damage than you'd expect (or were probably intended. Ice Breath being the biggest contender).Now, with that big wall of whining aside for the second paragraph, if you can tolerate a little jankiness and won't get too flustered during the gravity sections, on the whole the game is still undeniably fun. Just rampaging around like an unstoppable killing machine and slicing through enemies like butter is always enjoyable. Just as long as you don't care about it having an interesting story.			"

												This is a 2D Side Scrolling Metroidvania-light with extensive melee combat, and a little bit of backtracking. The combat options are surprisingly deep, and the character is fairly acrobatic, leading to lots of off-the-main road explorations.  Boss battles are challenging but fair (although there was one near the end I really had trouble with), and there's enough reward for going back through the earlier levels that I added probably two hours to my game time backtracking (and still only ended with 85% completion). The story is really slight, but that isn't the point of the game. There are some issues (only one save slot, and you can't go back to explore more after finishing the game; travel between sections for backtracking takes a lot more work than it should), but overall it's a fun, challenging action adventure.

It has a fair amount of exploration that reminds me of Metroid, and the action, while fast, rarely gets out of control. Sadly, the boss fights can be very agrivating, enough to make me stop playing the game, but I still considering it a great title for people with the patience and skill to overcome the rather cheap boss fights.

												I Love this game, it has a way of rewarding players for completing difficult tasks and that makes me wanna play more. The combat is actually fun and really interactive. Unlike most metroidvania games I see, this games combat is actually on point and its not a chore to do. There is a problem, with how the game runs in general-graphics quality are okay and the anti-aliasing isn't that great, but the game will still tank some random frame drops down to even 10FPS. My computer is high end, I can run most games at highest quality graphics and still run at 60FPS. I can tell you that this game is actually on the easy side (strider facerolls everything) but try it on hard difficulty and it can be a lot of fun. Overall- If you like games like Castlevania symphony of the night (I didn't play much metroid so I can't refference it) and like flowing combat you will like this game, however even if you don't, I encourage you to give this game a try and see for yourself, there is actualy a dedicated minimap that indicates where you are supposed to go next-it's still up to you to find out how to get there though, so there is still a lot of exploration and finding upgrades. NOW GO WATCH SOME STRIDER GAMEPLAY ON YOUTUBE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS!  "

												This game is awesome I am so glad it was made. I fondly remember playing the original Strider on the Super Nintendo and also remember it as being one very tough game to beat. I highly reccomend playing with a controller and also playing on a big screen TV. The action is fast and the combat is satisfying. The boss fights so far for me have been beatable but not a walk in the park there is some challenge to it. If you were a fan of the original or like fast paced combat platformer type games I reccomend you give this a try.			"

												This is the game that introduced me to the Strider series.  After playing this game it made me want to purchase the one that was released for the PS1.  There are so many things in this game such as upgrades to make you more powerful hidden throughout the world.  Because of this, the game is rewarding you for exploration.  Trying to be as powerful as possible before fighting the final boss has always felt good in my opinion.  If you have not heard of the series, I would still recomend this game to you.  It is a good mix of challenge and reward and you should buy it if you like metroidvania style games.			"

												STRIDER™ / ストライダー飛竜® is a pretty cool game about a pretty cool dude that happens to be a ninja man. You run fast and slice and dice! You play as a STRIDER™ who has been in past games such as Strider and Marvel Vs. Capcom 2: New Age of People! HYA HYA HYA HYA HYA is the sound you will hear often as you run through hordes of evil robit mens and it will surely be a blast in the pants.			"

												Strider is a patron saint of the 2D arcade pantheon, that I have a little shrine to in my heart. If you remember how awesome the attract mode of the original looked back in '88, then you know how awesome this game will make you feel.Fluid physics; graceful controls. The best Sci-Fi Metroidvania since Shadow Complex. I was deeply skeptical of this game, and it proved me wrong again and again. The swordplay is like a blend of SOTN and MMX - this is an incredible achievement. Well played, Capcom. For the first time in a decade, well played. High points: deflecting almost anything with a plasma sword. Dashing through enemies to cause explosions. Sending explosive kunai into mechs. Listening to the excellent effects work, and noticing callbacks to twenty years of gaming. Riding a holographic plasma panther.10/10, would buy again at full price.			"

												You can't change the keybindings. You're stick using the arrow keys, space, A, S, D, left CTRL and right CTRL.It also didn't seem to register my PS4 controller, which works perfectly with other games such as MGSV.Worse yet is that the level design so far has been terrible, and the clunky controls do nothing to help. You automatically grab on to any wall you touch, which would be fine if the game was designed around it. It is not. I constantly found myself grabbing on to random ledges while I was trying to avoid enemies.Speaking of which, there are a lot of enemies to dodge. Not that they really pose any threat, mind you, at least not on Normal difficulty. As long as you're mashing the attack button, S, you're going to be fine. Shielded enemies must be guard broken with a charged attack, though, which really breaks the flow of combat. The graphics are nice, though, I'll give it that.			"

												Where do I begin?I have played this game for an hour now and I have been nothing but impressed with this game so far, The consoles respond rather well, I really enjoy the whole Metroidvania style that this game has although from someone who grew up in the 90's and didn't play the original strider I am unable to comment on if this is how the game was back then.Being a huge fan of hack and slash titles I feel right at home with the fast and energetic gameplay that this game has to offer, The game has tons of unlockables such as concept art and intel to health upgrades and new gadgets/abilities for Hiruu to use. The sound track is pretty cool from what I have heard so far and the boss battles are pretty decent too.Overall I really did enjoy this game and will go on to probably enjoy it for many many more hours to go.9/10(At the time of writing this review this game is currently available in the Capcom Humble Bundle. Please google for more information.)			"

												Wow, this game is fantastic. Having played the original NES Strider and the Genesis Strider, I have to say this game is an absolutely fantastic reboot. It has the open-world feel of the original NES classic but with much better level (and graphic) design, and has the quality of color and atmospheric charm of the Genesis version but with far better view instead of the absurdly close-up shots of Strider Hiryu at the benefit of graphical fidelity. Besides that the game is clean and crisp. It's a joy to play and although at first it may seem too easy (there are difficulty options), that's just a nice way to lull you into the fact that this game requires a lot of strategy. While you start with these clunky combos and button-mashing slaying of any of the Kazakh guards you see, their tactics and yours have to evolve to suit the multi-levelled terrain, the new equipment and abilities both you and the enemies get, and your general skill. The better you get, the more the game begins to feel like a brutal ballet where Strider vaults over enemies and cuts everything in his path with effortless grace. The story is far better than that of its originals since now there's not only voice acting but it's actually got a cohesive and tangible plot this time that isn't arbitrarily sending you across the world in a weirdly specific set of locations with little backstory.Overall, this is a very fun game. I really recommend it.			"

												This is one of my top 5 favorite games. Having played the original Strider, I can say that the devs captured the feel incredibly well. It's not the longest game, but it's definitely worth the $15. Even though I pre-ordered it, I would've bought this game for $30 or more. I really loved how it's the player's choice of when they want to do the final boss fight. 9/10			"

												9.5/10 This game is GREAT!  As someone who beat the genesis strider 1 and strider returns, NES Strider, Playstation Strider 2 (Japanese version), and who has been slaying people on MVC1, 2, and 3 ultimate, this is a wonderful game.  It's like the creators looked at the game Moon Diver which was supposed to be the successor to the Strider franchise, and learned from all the mistakes that were made in that title.  Even without ANY powerups, from the get go, Strider feels just as sleek and fine tuned in his handling and controls as he did on any of his previous incarnations including MVC.  Add in all the cool power ups, the button combinations that are needed to traverse levels, and the multitude of secrets waiting for the gamer with an eye for exploration, and you have a wonderful romp in a revamped Strider universe that  pays many nods to the previous games.There are only a few things for which I fault this game.  Firstly, the music is awesome, especially the nod to the NES Egypt Rail Carrier track.  The track is slower and there are trains in the background capturing some of the feel of the original NES content. However, it drops the ball in that there is no level that takes place on a high speed train.  This was an effect that was supremely brought to life on the NES.  With the current technology, it would have been awesome to see how an idea such as this could have been illustrated and also the game mechanics that would have been involved.  Secondly, we are given different color palattes for Strider as mementos from fallen Striders.  This is a cop-out as it would have been much better to actually RESCUE said Striders and have them join Strider's team either as a type of limited subweapon or as an AI controlled ally or as a completely different character that can be swapped out at any save station.  With that said, if there were other playable characters, the idea of Co-op would easily be implementable.  And, considering that Co-op was already a part of Moon Diver, there is really no excuse for there to be a lack of couch Co-op for Strider.Still, that only amounts to a 0.5 point deduction on an awesome game.

												Story and Characters: 9/10I mean killing the Winds sisters? Instant win. Hired to kill the Grandmaster Meio? Even better. A classic retelling of the core Strider story complete with the classic assassination feeling along with the judgement of self-righteousness. The villains do not disappear after beating them once and pose a threat every step of the way, even during easy mode.Art and Sound: 9/10 The 2D animation does not try to focus on nostalgia which I really prefer rather than relying on old nostalgic feelings for a game. This makes me feel like a new reboot that actually works which is incredibly rare (I'm looking at you Nintendo). It is aesthetically pleasing. The classic Hiryu ""HAHHH"" attack sound is missing which I will take a point off just for that (pls add it in the future!)Gameplay: 8/10 Some of the directional attacking is a bit clunky. Although overall the games easy to learn keys are nice on the hands. The directional jumps can also interfere with some tricky terrain passes where you have to calculate the amount of time and reflex you have to make a jump etc. So far I enjoy the upgrades to your Cypher which really makes this higher than it should be (you are welcome Capcom)Replayability: 7/10Can get a bit repetitive but worth exploring the other difficulty options while having fully upgraded your Cypher. Although for $15 dollars this is definitely replayable to a point where you will see immersing yourself into it for hours on end.Final Thoughts Overall: 8/10Strider Hiryu is a classic game rebooted not to fit into the ""nostalgia"" resurgence of this past decade but tells a core retelling of his story, one that vividly explains the struggle of the Strider character. Buy this. You will not be disappointed. Thank you Double Helix and Capcom for bringing us this masterpiece.			"

												Wow. GRIN's Bionic Commando Rearmed is probably my favorite action game of all time, striking the perfect balance of classic 8-bit old school design and modern gameplay conventions into a blended whole that surpasses all prior (and sadly, subsequent) versions of the franchise. Amazingly, Double Helix's recent version of Strider does the exact same thing for the Cyber-Ninja that seemingly had a larger following in the fighting game scene than in his own titles.Now, Strider's not BCR exactly. Some choices seem a smidge ill-fitting at first. Like the Metroidvania ""single grand level"" concept seems odd when you have such a mobile character who traditionally has gone through disparate locales in his games like a horny teenager goes through tissues, but they pack it with so many devious traps to flip around and baddies to chop up in such a large set of locations you'll never notice once you get going. Besides, it allows for a ""just right"" amount of item collection and several super-hidden spots concealing bonus costumes and concept art to give players their OCD collector fix. In general, that's probably the best descriptor of the game design as a whole: just right. And it leads a constant cavalcade of classic Capcom chaos! So much so that there's little to actually say about most of the moment ot moment gameplay that wouldn't just spoil the experience if you're interested after seeing the trailers. Like the Matrix, you really can't be told how awesome it is to be Strider Hiryu, you have to experience it for yourself. I for one, highly recommend plunking down the simoleans to give Strider a go. You'll be slicing and dicing through hordes of Russian Cyber-men within seconds, and flipping and ninja-vanishing around deadly traps while reflecting bullets into robots and summoning your holo-panther buddy to tear new holes into old foes for the next 4-9 hours depending on your difficulty and how much you want to collect.

												So I just beat the game.  The best way I can explain my experience is Shadow Complex meets Ninja Gaiden.  The controls are insanely tight.   The sword swings as fast as you can press the attack button.... no waiting on animations. The graphics are vibrant and clean, with lots of pretty flashes of colors that would make any toddler drool in amazement.   The game makes you genuinely feel like you are far more skilled than you really are, mostly because you can move through most of the game without stopping.  Strider is extremely overpowered, but never to the point of feeling invincible.  I loved this game for the most part, though I have to admit that I was disappointed with the lack of weapon choice or any sort of rpg elements.  I understand that they weren't aiming for that, so I don't really hold it against it.   While it's not my favorite metroidvania, it definetly satiates my craving for a new SotN or Super Metroid.			"

												Strider is a steal at $15. I got maybe 8 hours out of it playing on the normal difficulty and had a blast the whole time. For the most part, it does a great job of making you feel like a total badass ninja relentlessly slicing through foe after foe. The platforming is pretty easy as long as you're not going for a 100% completion; once you try to go for everything, you'll have to do some sections where you must freeze enemies in order to make stepping stones. Even then controlling HIryu is a breeze. The running and jumping make for some of the most entertaining movement controls I've seen since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and it smartly alternates between blistering action and platforming in gracious tandem. Strider Hiryu's latest game is a load of fun while being a great homage to the original. After a while, when you have a full range of abilities and powerups, it's easy to feel overpowered as you mow down the opposition. It's a fun Metroidvania that I wouldn't mind playing again.			"

												Strider was a very fun and enjoyable action side scroller. Filled with beautiful lighting and fast paced fights, it reminded me of the old days of NES and SNES titles like Metroid and Megaman, along with the (of course) previous installments in the Strider franchise. (Which I have not yet gotten a chance to try personally.) I encourage the use of a controller with this game, but those on the keyboard should be able to manage.Liked:-Fun-Fast-Fluid-Metroidvania-Level design (in general*)Disliked:-Stun locks-Poorly designed invisible walls*-Unengaging story-Questionable voice acting-Anti-climatic ending-Saving at the end of the game stops you from going back and collecting everything. Is an option not to save however. (Awesome reward for beating the final boss... /sarcasm)Overall Score: 6/10			"

												Do you like Metroid?Do you like Mega Man X?I do, and this game being the marriage of the two works out very well. Strider plays like a smoother, quicker modern version of how Zero played in Mega Man X4 and X5. The best thing about this game is that very feel; your character can slash enemies 1:1 with how fast you can mash the attack button and it's very satisfying to plow through enemies at a full sprint.The game is somewhat of a free form metroidvania, but only somewhat. Your objectives are given to you marked on a map and you only need to backtrack through one area in order to fight a particular boss. You can find secrets and upgrades by exploring more once you've powered up, but all of the crucial stuff you'll find just by letting the game hold your hand. The fact that the city is technically open to exploration is nice though, and it doesn't slow the pace of the game if you don't let it. Surely going back to grab stuff often serves as a nice break between difficult boss fights.So the gameplay is really solid all around and that's what's important- however you may find that things are lacking in art direction and story. There are a handful of environments to traverse as the city is separated into districts, but each one is blander than the last. Visually, the game doesn't have much personality especially when you consider that the character's mouths don't move during voice acted cutscenes. I'm not a visual designer, but what I think what this game needed was a darker, more dystopian tone rather than the spitshined anime one we got.The story can't be called a disaster because it isn't really there, but what is there feels dissapointing in light of the fact that they actually bothered to animate a few cutscenes and record dialogue. Especially after defeating the final boss, you might find that the complete lack of meaningful exposition or resolution brings down the experience.Overall, an 8/10 with one point deducted for the each of the two paragraphs above. The gamplay style is timeless and I disagree with the majority of people who found this game frustrating. At about 7 hours for my first normal playthrough, it may be most worth it to buy during a 50% sale but it is generally worth it anyway. It's a fun time.			"

												Just beat this game on Normal difficulty after about 7 hours playtime (according to the in-game timer), and it was mostly enjoyable. It starts off a little overwhelming with a small healthbar and enemy bullets that seem almost impossible to fully dodge, but by the end of the game you're jumping & air dashing all over the place chucking exploding kunai and freezing any fool that gets close enough to you.Overall it's a solid if somewhat linear action-exploration game (Metroidvania). It's always a good sign when I still want to play more after beating it, and this game gives me that very feeling.			"

												I only half mean that 'not recommended' thingthe game's great and all but it has an abnormally high graphics demand and no real graphics settings, and the way it handles that is to slow the game down so it can take more time to do things, usually at half speed (vsync'd, 30 effective FPS instead of 60)upgrade scenes didn't help for me either, they can't be skipped and happen frequently, and they're all the exact same ""you got a thing"" animation, which makes the game feel much slower paced than it shouldran into a bug here and there that forced game restarts back to checkpoints, typically character spawning somewhere they aren't allowed to be, but they tended to go away after the first restartif your computer can run a couple other modern games at once without issue you might be okay, and if you can't then you may still be able to run it at it's halved speed, but the lack of settings to fix the slow pace wasn't enjoyable for me			"

												A great throwback to the classic 80s and 90s side scroller. Fun, great graphics, sound, and control scheme. Easily the best modern platformer I've played so far. My only complaint is the the difficulty of the last level. I played on hard and while most of the game wasn't too hard to get through there is a massive step up on the last level - it's like most of the game plays at about 4 or 5 and the last level; is stepped up to 20. Then the boss fight comes and it's a 6 or 7. Very odd. Also, there are lots of complaints on here about it crashing but I only experienced it once but I can understand why it'd be incredibly frustrating with the save points being fairly spread out.			"

Product received for free
												Above all else, this is a game for anyone who gets a kick out of precise controls - assuming you have a decent controller to hand. Strider's signature katana arc is in full evidence here, allowing you to let loose a pleasing flurry of attacks or charge up for a longer-range strike. Movement includes an array of somersault jumps and combine with a wall-climbing mechanic that is never too clingy (as such mechanics can sometimes be). Basically, every room of enemies can be a fun, adrenaline-filled dance - and this is just with the basic toolset the game starts with.There's some interesting depth here - you not only get ranged kunai attacks, a short teleporter hop and three extra modes for your sword, but each of these get different effects in combination, giving you plenty of high-energy options to take down even bigger foes with finesse. There's also a chain-based higher damage mode you can get to if you score a high succession of hits - I never popped the achievement for doing this 25 times, but I managed to quickly take down the one boss I had any real trouble by trigging a succession of these, and like everything else in this game's combat, it has the capacity to make you feel like the ultra-badass you probably aren't.Elsewhere, the game can be unexceptional, though not in any significantly detrimental way. This Strider goes full Metroidvania, and while the aforementioned puzzles are great to track down, it lacks the clever item placement of something like Super Metroid (and for better or worse, there's nothing like that game's shine sparking to test your skills/patience). The environments are thoughtfully if visually unspectacular in their construction - though gameplay is on a 2D plane they've done a great job of layering things in the background and foreground, but it can all look a little samey and the series' distinctive cyber-soviet environments seem a little low-key this time round.Enemy design is a similar story - in terms of function they've nailed it (on sight you have a good idea how an encounter is going to go down, and attacks are appropriately telegraphed so you can get on with the business of dodging and obliterating) but the designs don't really stick in your memory. Bosses are a little better on this front, though they're ultimately lifted from earlier games (and they have some over-used chatter before you encounter them).Still, unless you've recently burned yourself out on Metroidvania-esque titles, there's more than enough style and substance in this game. I've owed this one a review for three years now - taken me around this time to actually have a machine that can run it (oddly) - Chris covered for me on thereticule (http://thereticule.com/strider-the-verdict/), but I couldn't resist singing it's praises myself, especially as three years on, it seems to have largely been forgotten. A shame.			"

												Pros-Fun Boss Battles-Great Skill Design-Ran great on my rig-Smooth controls-Not to long or short time wise-crisp modern graphics(not really a graphics guy but this game looks great while running smoothly)Note: I've read reviews where the writer complains about how drab world. I agree it's drab but no because of art direction. Strider really needed better world building behind it to be masterpiece.  Cons-Weak story/world buildingStrider was great fun. The pace of the game makes you feel like an expert warrior. The action is just at the right speed where I have enough time to react while not being a cake walk either.  Another aspect I loved about Strider was the way skills progressed in the game. Each tool had its distinct strength and wasn't overshadowed by new additions to Strider's arsenal. The enemy variety just was right in that non-boss combat did not feel monotonous meaning each enemy required its unique approach for the most part. The boss battles were really the highlight of this game for me. Some boss patterns were easy and others were hard but none of the fights felt gimmicky. I couldn't just stay in one spot and win the battle. Dodging and moving in to attack were the general patterns but each boss fight requires its own approach in executing those actions. The only aspect that I felt Strider lacked was story. I never gained strong sense of connection with Strider. Nobody in the story cared for Strider leaving me with nothing to identify with. I felt like a random guy who did all these awesome things in a world where the Why was never explained. Maybe these feeling are a result of me having never played a Strider game before? I mean it's alright if you don't give the main character a lot of depth because it's a game but if you take that course your world needs to have the depth to support the story your trying to tell.  The story was decent though and game play was more than enough to make up for the story's failings. This game is really great and you shouldn't pass it up if you enjoy action games. At least for me, Strider sets the standard for the modern Metroidvania title.			"

												I played alot of Strider on the NES when I was a kid. . . and I tell you when this remake busted out the Kazakh theme remixed in the first stage, it hit me right in the feels.  The action is really fluid, exactly like a Strider game should feel.  I really like the different perspectives and the 3-D aspects of this new iteration.  It has crashed a number of times on me, which resets me back to the last checkpoint, but the gameplay is so fun I didn't mind all that much.  If you were a Strider fan, or appreciate metroidvania games, this game is really worth it.			"

												I picked up Strider at some point in one of the many bundles I've bought on sale over the years and went in blind. I expected some sort of platformy hack and slash, I ended up with a fairly engaging ninja-themed metroidvania game.As with most metroidvania games, you start out with fairly minimal abilities. Minimal to the point where I was not very impressed at first since I was just spamming the slash attack. Once you get a few power ups though, your combat options open up immensely and it becomes way more engaging. This isn't to say that it's perfect, I found the combat actually got annoying at several points in the game as some enemies were bullet (slash?) sponges no matter which powers you used, to the point where I found myself skipping over a lot of enemies. I also found some enemy types incredibly annoying to fight against due to the fact that they can stunlock you to death in large packs. Sure you could dodge the bullets, but if you mess up even once, a sufficiently large pack will refreeze/stun you as soon as you break out. Aside from those fights though, I found the boss fights to be very fun with varied mechanics.Movement in this game was great, especially as you unlock powers to increase your movement options and unlock new areas. I always felt like I was in control when moving, which is great for combat. My only complaint is that some maps are fairly large and I found myself wishing for a quick way to traverse large flat areas, such as with some sort of charge/sprint power seen in some other games in the genre. I also found it annoying that the dash skill you eventually unlock completely kills your momentum. It's great for giving you more fine control, but it makes traversing through old areas to look for unlocks annoying.			"

												Normal playthrough: 10h 23minHard playthrough: 10h 43min (though it might as well be 20+ hours)So after I beat the game on normal I though I'd get my moneys worth and play the game on hard. It was deffenetly a challange if not fully frustrating at times and I got all but 1 achievement doing so as well as 100% of the items & upgrades.I did find a lot of flaws while doing so as well namely the game is locked to vsync and forcfully unlocking it is a bad idea. On windowed fullscreen it locks to 50hz on my system: I get it, PAL retro being assigned that. The visuals seem garnered for 720p so on a 1080p 24'' monitor the textures really suffer even with all the injected AA & AO.Soundtrack is fantastic, nothing wrong there.Some cinematics hide loading times, so expect some to be partially if not fully skip-able.You need a gamepad, though that's very much a given for 2D platformers.Then there are the bugs, like when I catapulted on a ledge in the research secot and teleported me all the way down (specifically the platforming challange part trying to get intel orbs). There are more, but I have to go back and catalogue them.An enjoyable game, but it has caveats.Also Meio's Tower can go die on the Hard difficulty, the last phase of the elevator is really annoying.Old Review: If you like Metroidvania this one does a lot right. Give it a go.If you like the Stider stuff this is very faithful and a loveletter to it.Could use some polish here and there, but nothing major.			"

One of my favorite NES games updated with excellent graphics, far better controls, and a sense of speed that is extra satisfying when you only have a half-hour or an hour to play. Recent problems with sudden game crashes seems to have been fixed by the latest Nvidia drivers (I'm playing on a laptop with a GTX 870m). Highly recommended.			"

												Reboot of Strider (1989): a 2D platform hack and slash game.Very decent game for those looking for this kind of game. While it does resemble the original game it was redone to fit today's standards.Pros: - Controls are very responsive specially with a gamepad - Upgrade system similar to metroid - Graphics are good - Music is decent - Levels are very well designed - Upgrades are well designed and useful - Fun and it doesn't get boringCons: - Voice actors speak like they're in a cartoon, most sound like morons and there's no Japanese option - Altough graphics are good, I'm not a fan of dark and exagerated bloom effect - 3D models lack detail and some look uninspired - Lacks variety in enemies and backgrounds - In the original Strider the enemies were anime styled, much cooler and colorful - In the original Strider the backgrounds were much more varied and colorful - The collectable items are not rewarding and kind of irrelevant - Short gameDespite the negative points I'm not complaining that the developers spent much more time in level design than graphics or created a short decent game rather than a long crappy game. It is a much better game than the original.Hopefully Capcom will create more Strider games like this one.			"

												Amazing, well planned and constructed maps; very visually appealing.  My only issue is with the play controls - I was expecting a loose control scheme, but was given a reactive-type instead.For example:When Strider gets close to a wall in midair, he reacts by grabbing onto the wall with his ninja tools.When Strider attacks an enemy with a shield, the game reacts by slowing the game for effect while his weapon bounces off the shield and stuns him.When Strider is struck in midair with practially anything, he reacts by falling to the ground and won't react until you've tried to jump several times.When Strider stands on a gravity globe, the controls react depending on which side of the globe you're on and you have to change which direction to hold on the control stick in order to keep moving.  This is especially frustrating during the final boss fight in which not only are you jumping from gravity globe to gravity globe but you're dodging seemingly random attacks that all stun on impact whether you're airborne or not.The game is great for what it is, but don't pick it up expecting a Metroidvania game - it's more a ninja-action game, which is really quite fitting the character and series.

												An average metroid-vania game with a hack-n-slash focus. While the combat is fun and frantic, it requires little finesse: Most rooms will be cleared with the same combination of abilities. Player upgrades are a little disappointing, and short of the first few, they have minimal effect on the way you play the game.Visuals are great, using the 3D side-on environment to great effect. The story and world had potential, but too many key figures follow the evil villain stereotype to be taken seriously.If this style of game is your cup of tea, then I'd happily recommend it, but only after you first look into Shadow Complex.[7.0]			"

												As far as I know, Strider was not a particularly commonly known franchise, which is a shame given how awesome the 2014 version is. This is speaking as someone who only has ever played the NES version, which despite being okay, wasn't the greatest game to hit the market. However, this one far exceeded any expectations I had.You are Strider Hiryu, your job is to kill Grandmaster Meio, but obviously no game could be as simple as THAT...and for good reason because Hiryu is a total badass and it's a pleasure to play longer just so you can kick serious heiney. It's a very action oriented game since you run, jump, and just generally hack anything that moves to death with Hiryu's Cypher, which apparently is some kind of tonfa-sword combo that can be powered with various plasma types. The game can probably best be described as a Metroidvania for those of you who know what that is. Hiryu must overcome various obstacles by searching out new weapons, abilities, and such to make it all around Meio's city.And that's where the game has me for sure. If you're the kind of person who loves adventuring all about, having to know what's around every corner, and getting a little excited when you find a new power-up that will let you be even MORE of a badass ninja than you already are, then yes, definitely a game to consider getting. I'm currently not finished with the game, but I've logged a number of hours already and the game say's I'm only about 60% of the way through.If there is one complaint to be had, I'll say that for normal difficulty, it seems particularly easy. Though I've done quite well at finding all the HP Upgrades, Hiryu doesn't take all too much damage unless you're standing around LETTING him get shot. If anything, the worst I've faced is when Hiryu falls into a trap and disappears and respawns on solid safe ground, which is more of an irritant than a real danger. Perhaps a harder difficulty on a later playthrough will give a bit more challenge, or possibly the game itself will bare its fangs when I get closer to the end.Overall, I'd say it's a solid game and I'm quite often finding it difficult to hit the Exit option when I really need to stop playing :D			"

												I beat Strider a couple of days ago, and it was awesome.Being a big fan of metroidvania genre, I wanted to play this game for a really long time. I've heard that people were having problems with repeated crashes, frame-rate drops and some confusing level design, but on my playthrough of Strider I didn't notice any of that stuff, well, maybe some FPS drops, but I can't call game a bad one just because of that.It was refreshing, yet familiar experience. I haven't played a whole lot of previous Strider games, but in this one I felt right at home. Graphics were stunning, ambient sounds and music that played occasionally were giving me right feel at the right time - there was some perfect sound both for action and for atmosphere. Controls were solid, if a little too complicated, but once I got used to them, everything became just right. Kazakh City was decently big and really fun to explore with rich variety of zones, though, some areas like Underground were a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get to. I was aiming to collect every collectible besides large green containers (they're nothing but a health refill item anyway) and this led to some frustration, because some of the little Strider icons, which give you costumes, were really challenging to collect. Other than those, I loved collecting all the items, but I missed a few optional icons with concept art, which isn't a big deal.The core gameplay of Strider was fun and addictive, I spent hours just running around, killing bad guys in style and jumping on the rooftops like madman. Bosses were memorable and very challenging, except for Gravitrons (I was seriously just sitting in one spot and throwing exploding kunai at them until they broke). Final stage was epic and fight with Grandmaster Meio felt like complete joke after such a hard stage. Still, I enjoyed it and the victory was pretty sweet.The game was constantly throwing new stuff, enemies and objectives at me, helping to learn new tactics and kept me entertained until the very end.

												Pretty solid modernized version of Strider with Metroid-like level progression, though I wouldn't consider it a fully fledged metroidvania game since exploration aspect in this game is pretty pale. Takes around 7 hours to 100%. Navigation outside of main objectives isn't very fun and there aren't any real points of interest besides color-coded locked doors which usually hide a power-up or concept art unlock.Game itself is more combat oriented and that's where is shines. All animations are fast and don't cancel anything (e.g. you can jump, throw kunai and power up your slash at the same time), plus you get 4 different attack types that change how your combat moves behave, neither mode is a direct upgrade but instead they compliment each other (e.g. use reflective mode to reflect bullets while you run torwards the enemy, switch to magnetic mode and dash to stun them, and then switch to flame mode to finish the stunned enemy off). Most locked doors are opened by a dash so you don't have to pause while moving from area to area either. There are no pauses during movement or combat, it feels very streamlined and fast-paced.Visuals are nice and clean, have a nice style (e.g. some effects like dust or explosions look more hand-drawn than realistic), but nothing to write home about. Enemies telegraph their shots and projectiles are very easy to see. Bosses make great use of projectiles, something you would see in old arcade games. Bosses in this game are in general very fun and challenging, and urge you to move a lot, unlike some other modern metroidvania games (*cough*Shadow Complex*cough*).One thing that puzzles me is complete lack of facial animations during cutscenes. It's not noticable on Hiryu and some other characters that wear masks, but it looks very cheap on characters that don't.Some issues with the game: Game is locked at 60 fps. You can't remap keys in-game, but you can do so by editing config files. Non-XInput controllers are supported only through third-party means (x360ce). Controls during segments that have non-standard gravity are just plain bad both on keyboard and controller, but these segments are rare and it doesn't ruin them completely.			"

												I'll never forget the first time I saw Strider in the Arcade, I was blown away (The visuals! The sounds!! The bosses!!!) It was like a magnet for my Alladdin's Castle Tokens...Fast forward to the announcement of an NES version of the game...I was super psyched (hmm...these screenshots aren't quite what I'm expecting...). Now fast forward again to the release of the NES game (What is this...it's nothing like the Arcade?!), then suddenly (Wait a minute, this is pretty cool...), and finally (This is one of the greatest NES games ever!!!)Several years later I became the unfortunate owner of the Turd known as ""Strider 2"" by US GOLD for the Amiga. I couldn't resist when I saw the box at the store (Strider 2, are you kidding me!). The excitement only lasted a few short seconds...(Looks kind of like Strider, Sounds kind of like Strider...wait...did I just morph into a robot with tank treads for feet?!?! What the hell is this garbage!). It was so bad I had repressed the memory, only to have it crawl from the stinky depths while writing this review. US GOLD were The Masters of Dissapointment...Sh@tting all over some of my favorite franchises.Strider 2 on PS1 (alright, now we're back in business!) was pretty solid, and although didn't quite have that magic that I had found in the original Arcade or NES game, it was another good Strider game (nothing wrong with that!).Over the last 14 years, Hiryu would occasionally appear in Capcom games as an extra or playable charachter and this gave me some hope that they hadn't forgotten about one of my favorites.There was also Moon Diver on XBLA that was very ""Stider-esque"" and I believe was made by some former capcom employees, and that was decent...Then came the announcement of this game...Initially I was excited, but apprehensive (what if it's not good...) so for some reason I held off. After hearing a friend mention how much he liked the new game, I decided it was time to give it a shot. In short, I love this game! It's like a delicious combo platter of the Original 2 (arcade & NES) Strider games, with chunky bits of strider 2 mixed in, all served up on a tasty Metroidvania platter. The graphics are great, the Sound is great, the controls are great (xb360 controller), there's lots to see and do, plenty of abilities and secrets to find, and there are some epic boss battles.  What more could I ask for? Not much...If you like a good MetroidVania game, you'll like this. If you like a good Metroidvania game, and you like Strider, chances are you'll love this as much as I do.			"

												The best way I can explain this game is the crazy Ninja stuff from Ninja Gaiden & Dynasty Warriors with the Platforming elements of Super Metriod.If you like the sound of that then, pick up STRIDER because its just that.The enemy scaling needs some work; at the start they can kill you quickly if you're not careful but they can also die just as fast but about 4 hours in it starts to balance up but every thing now becomes a painstaking one button Hold or Tap.also i have a feeling its just me but, if you have a GTX 770, DON'T DSR on this game, it just crashes when you die.BUT OTHER THAN THAT...I LOVE THIS GAME, you can easily spend a few hours before you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at dying in the same section of enemy.It's fluid game and a beautiful game minus those STUPID FAKE SCAN LINES, but I guess it's trying to go for a flamboyant 80s look and some of the faces have NO animations? it's a bit creepy			"

												Pretty fun all in all, though not perfect.  Running around and controlling strider feels pretty good, def.  makes you feel like ninja, but same time some of the grappling stuff is kind of janky, especially when you start having to deal with the wierd gravity balls. Also note, you get 4 different elements for your weapon, though doesnt seem to play that much of a part in how you play the game.  There is some things to find ala metroid, but you will find most of them in your playthrough.  Honestly, i didnt really try to find them all, they made things a bit easier but didnt really give you a new way to play the game.  One last note that comes to mind, the enviroments all kind of blend in, i was jumping around different maps and couldnt really even tell the difference at a certain point.  Not that they looked bad, just didnt stand out.			"

Highly recommended if you can play it with a controller. Otherwise...A solid, fast-paced action game with a Metroid-like exploration and high frame rate even on a 3-years-old laptop :D I've bought it on sale, but it would have been worth every single cent at full price XDOnly two real CONs:* on older computers (or older graphic cards) the game could perform really badly, since there is no frame skip. As a result, everything will go in slow-motion, killing the purpose of the game itself :/* to play it with some USB controllers, it is necessary to download a third-party tool/key mapper (e.g. X360CE) - as for many other games around here :/Oh, and trust me: a controller is indeed needed. Attempting to play this game with a keyboard will lead to frequent rage quits or key smashing. Without a controller, it's extremely difficult to play properly, given the dynamic feeling and pace of the game itself.Highly recommended! Every real fan of Metroidvania games and classic arcade scrolling games should give it a try!			"

												Must be about 23 years since I first played Strider on my old Sega. When I saw this on the Steam store I had to check it out. Remake with modern graphics and gameplay... I've seen these before and they never really turn out to be good. Since this was on offer I decided to give it a chance, and wow...I must say I'm very impressed. It's wonderful to see an old favourite kept true to it's original concept and gameplay style but modernised in a classy and stylish way. To summarise, this is a 2d platformer with polished mechanics, fast-paced combat, all the old favourite Strider moves and new ones, quality boss fights and nice visuals. If you played the old school or not, this game is definitely worth a try. You won't be disappointed.			"

												I did not know what to expect coming into Strider.  I only had a passing awareness of what the game was from AGDQ and Hiryu's likeness from other games.  So, no expectations.I have to say, though, that Strider is really good at what it is.  I went straight to the hardest difficulty and didn't have much trouble except for a few bosses, so it's not a difficult game, but it is a good game.  The level design is definitely that classic Metroidvania-style and the sheer number of collectables and power-ups provides plenty of reason to backtrack to get it all.There's not much enemy diversity and most of them can be felled by actually just mashing the attack button, but the game still rewards planning and awareness, especially through a few key sections that are basically bullet hells.  Some of the segments are basically puzzle-platformers, others are straight-on combat, and the variance is nice.  The game is paced well.My one major gripe with the game is a gravity mechanic that comes into play a few times (including the final boss fight).  The controls while in gravity fields are not intuitive, so I had to fight my instincts in order to get fluid movement.  This mechanic is only used three times in the entire game, so it's not game-wrecking, just an occasional annoyance.A good game.  I intend to 100% it soon.			"

												Very fun concept and constant gameplay changes are what you can expect from this recreation of Capcom's classic side scrolling action adventure. Enemy variety, multiple weapon effects and upgrades go very good in combination with this very fast game. Controls are great and super responsive (I played on the controller), offer excellent character and situational control and for this reason its way too easy since enemies are pretty dumb and extremely easy to defeat, no exception! This game is super forgiving, even on the hardest difficulty setting where everything except for one or maybe two boss battles was just a mindless button mashing with barely any strategy involved which resulted in total annihilation of every enemy and numbness in my thumb. Its still pretty damn fun but feels to me like a wasted potential for a very good, tactical, hardcore action game. Maybe not the the most memorable game you will play but certainly a fun one.Pros:- Fun, fast & fluid gameplay- Smooth and responsive- New move every now and then- Beautiful graphics- Freedom of movementCons:- Very easy and shallow despite amazing character controll and multiple weapons- Story is so unimportant that I don't even remember it now, couple of hours after i finished the game- Would be much better if it had a good OST			"

												Very fun concept and constant gameplay changes are what you can expect from this recreation of Capcom's classic side scrolling action adventure. Enemy variety, multiple weapon effects and upgrades go very good in combination with this very fast game. Controls are great and super responsive (I played on the controller), offer excellent character and situational control and for this reason its way too easy since enemies are pretty dumb and extremely easy to defeat, no exception! This game is super forgiving, even on the hardest difficulty setting where everything except for one or maybe two boss battles was just a mindless button mashing with barely any strategy involved which resulted in total annihilation of every enemy and numbness in my thumb. Its still pretty damn fun but feels to me like a wasted potential for a very good, tactical, hardcore action game. Maybe not the the most memorable game you will play but certainly a fun one.Pros:- Fun, fast & fluid gameplay- Smooth and responsive- New move every now and then- Beautiful graphics- Freedom of movementCons:- Very easy and shallow despite amazing character controll and multiple weapons- Story is so unimportant that I don't even remember it now, couple of hours after i finished the game- Would be much better if it had a good OST			"

												A brilliant metroidvania with everything you could possibly want from the genre, themed around a cyber-ninja. The controls are tight, the level design is supurb (as is the location of the hidden goodies) and the graphics are really nice. The music is good, the array of weapons is varied and feels constantly progressive with each new item, just as the wide array of enemies steadily becomes more tricky to deal with. This game is hard, make no mistake, but they give you all the tools you need to survive, so the rest is up to learning patterns and being smart.I only have two issues: Firstly, the occasional ambient dialogue has a huge subtitle box, which can sometimes obscure what's going on (in one encounter, I couldn't seen my character at all when he wasn't jumping). Secondly, there's no facial animation - a small annoyance, and perhaps understandable when 90% of the characters have their face covered, or are too small to see outside of cutscenes... but it is something that bugs me, in any game.Highly recommended to any fans of the genre or ninja themes.

												Rating: 7/10 - A fun platform game, with light Metroidvania elements. Completion time: 7:30.= THE GOOD =- It's a very fun game to play; you slay eniemies, upon enemies, upon enemies- Very stylish graphics- Very responsive controls- The weapons, and their upgrades, are quite interesting, and make sense (although at the end, you'll use only plasma type 3 and 4)- The enemies are relatively varied- The bosses are quite fun- The maps are relatively large= THE SO-SO =- Although the graphics are beautiful, it lacks the variety and creativity of the first Strider, which is a big big shame- This could be somewhat classified as Metroidvania, although it's quite linear - in reality, you're only going to do a big backtrack at the end to pick up the missing powerups- The NPE/Bosses don't move their mouths while talking; this makes them a bit weird looking.= THE BAD =- You can't customize the keys. Arcade stick is not supported- You need 11 keys (ELEVEN!!) plus the 4 directions when playing, plus another 6/7 other ones used exclusively in map mode. This is very irritating; they could have made a more economic and intelligent choice.- Shielded enemies of type 2 can only be killed with Plasma 2, not 3/4. This has no real strategic implications; it will only force the player to switch the plasma, klll the enemy, and switch back again, which is nothing else than annoying- Many bosses will need to be killed several times over the game. It's quite boring to meet a past boss again.- You can't skip the bosses' blabbering, which is cheesy and banal, and ultimately irritating- The controls in ""floating"" gravity are a terrible mess, especially in the last boss- There is no ending. DAFUQ!?!			"

												As someone who played the first Strider game on Sega Genesis, I can say this game is truly perfect. It starts with the modified version of the same music and cutscene that plays in the beginning of the first Strider. However, It's A LOT EASIER than the first game which I don't consider it a really bad thing. At least you can finish the game!Also, to be honest, I had a lot of fun playing this game; Just run and slash everything that stands in your way.If you like fast platforming games, I think you really need to try this game, And probably you will not be disappointed.

												Strider pays homage to the classic side-scrolling action games of past, but with modern day conveniences (like no limit of retries, save files and checkpoints). This game has lots of fighting, lots of enemies, and a steadily increasing repetoire of abilities to use throughout. The game is fast-paced, and it always feels challenging but never unfair.If you want a quick romp through nostalgic gameplay, but without the headache of actually playing those old games that probably suck by today's standards, Strider is a good one to play.7/10 ""Good""			"

												While I did enjoy this game, it comes with a few things that to me felt like grievous issues.Cons:Camera - The camera is almsot always fine, but in a few boss fights it zooms in and out at horrible times and pulls away from the boss to follow Strider.  It's even worse around gravity globes you can run on, which are their own irritating issue that just becomes more annoying.No invincibility frames - A few normal enemies and a few boss attacks have their entire gimmick around this and squeezing as much damage as possible in one volley or chain stuns.  Easily a quarter or more of a fully upgraded health from one of those, or just getting pinballed between 2-4 enemies for a few seconds while you wait for the chance to have control again.Other smaller issues involve the final tower level being a boring difficulty spike and that wall climbing has you suddenly mantle up and over from a bit too generous of a distance.  Also there's an entire level where you run against the wind meaning you walk slow and jump short distances; meh.The Good:Movement is amazing.  Running, dashing, jumping, and sliding around while slashing everything in sight is solid and the best part of the game.  Worth a playthrough alone just to hop around and hit stuff really.The Metroidvaia aspect feels tacked on with four flavors (ice, fire, reflect, magnetic/ranged) to the dash, slash, and kunais, but overall is fun while you do a little backtracking here and there and have a dramatic pose animation that plays each time you pick up an upgrade.  Also ignore the story.  Not because the story is really bad, but because it's just in the way of the fun and makes deaths to bosses involve watching another boring taunt speech.For all of the negatives, I do still recommend this game oddly.  It's that much fun to play when the quirks aren't getting in your face.			"

												I did not know what to expect coming into Strider.  I only had a passing awareness of what the game was from AGDQ and Hiryu's likeness from other games.  So, no expectations.I have to say, though, that Strider is really good at what it is.  I went straight to the hardest difficulty and didn't have much trouble except for a few bosses, so it's not a difficult game, but it is a good game.  The level design is definitely that classic Metroidvania-style and the sheer number of collectables and power-ups provides plenty of reason to backtrack to get it all.There's not much enemy diversity and most of them can be felled by actually just mashing the attack button, but the game still rewards planning and awareness, especially through a few key sections that are basically bullet hells.  Some of the segments are basically puzzle-platformers, others are straight-on combat, and the variance is nice.  The game is paced well.My one major gripe with the game is a gravity mechanic that comes into play a few times (including the final boss fight).  The controls while in gravity fields are not intuitive, so I had to fight my instincts in order to get fluid movement.  This mechanic is only used three times in the entire game, so it's not game-wrecking, just an occasional annoyance.A good game.  I intend to 100% it soon.			"

												Strider is a great 2D action side scroller.  It's fast paced, requires a fair bit of finger dexterity, and is roughly a 12-hour game if you take your time to complete ~85% of the game on Normal.  The graphics and sound a fantastic as well.I can't remember any crashes or hangs, so it's quite stable as well.Like other 2D side scrollers of this sort, you get what you put in.  If you run through the game and skip most bad guys, and skipping out on the exploring and grabbing upgrades then it would grow old fast.  However, if you do generally the opposite then the game offers quite a bit of challenge and diversity to keep you interested.			"

												Overall a very fun, albeit short, Metroidvania title.  What it lacks in story it makes up for in the fluid, fast-paced combat and wonderful visuals as well as controls that feel really good (at least with a controller).   Game can be completed within probably 4-8 hours depending on whether or not you try to find all the hidden upgrades and collectibles (costumes (which are just recolors), enemy intel, concept art, etc.).   Doesn't really have much for replayability and navigating back to previous areas to collect stuff can feel daunting, but overall it's a fun little game for the length it provides. Would recommend waiting for it to be on sale as you probably won't get 15 hours out of it unless you're a completionist or enjoy the gameplay enough to play it a few times through.			"

												Pretty fun, but some nitpicks.1. Kind of short (I got almost everything in the game in about 8-9 hours)2. Inconsistent difficulty (Starts off balanced, gets fairly difficult, then becomes extremely easy, save a couple of boss fights and some incredibly annoying combinations of enemies, plus Meio is a pain to fight given how his arena is built)3. Weapons are rather unbalanced (Reflect (red) plasma is entirely outclassed by the other three, I just left explosive/fire on unless I needed to cheese something with homing kunai or slowly chip my way through a line of stunlock laser soldiers with the ice sword since explosive does the most damage)4. Movement can be really finicky and annoying in some situations (The plasma catapult has a weird hop on the end of its animation that can get you killed, Strider will stick to any wall he gets too close to so you can get killed trying to hop down a small gap such as in the Meio fight, some knockdown and stagger animations don't end unless you hit the ground requiring you to climb back up a huge room due to one enemy, those freeze-canister spider droids can easily stunlock you to death with spammed attacks since there's no stunlock protection, etc)Otherwise, it's a really solid, fun game with some challenging platforming, fun boss fights, and great combat. Plus, it's pretty cheap.			"

												Repetitive action gameplay with clean controls and an infuriating knockback mechanic. As a strider game, it is OK. (Recommend)As a metroidvania game, it is quite disappointing. (Do NOT recommend)PROS:-Clean controls-Good boss fights-Variety of collectiblesNEUTRALS:-Different weapon types don't really do anything different (except the freeze)-No real combat mechanics. The entire game you just mash  to swing your sword, and once you have kunais you also mash to throw those at the same time. Over and over. -Maybe 3 or 4 ""actual"" enemy types? (Wall cannons, soldiers w/ and w/o shields, and the 6 legged bot guys)CONS:-INCREDIBLY ANNOYING KNOCKBACK MECHANIC withOUT invul frames.....expect to get annoyed being knocked down cliffs, etc, and towards the end of the game you will get mini-chain stunned on the harder difficulty. -Metroidvania elements are barely implemented. Yes there are levels with collectibles strewn about, but the only thing preventing you from accessing them is colored doors (which can be opened by the various weapon types). There are very few hidden items (for example, one requires you to freeze a number of enemies and use them as stepping stones to cross a large gap....this type of hidden item is extremely rare in the game). Usually you just get the weapon, open the matching door, and upgrades voila.-No fast travel mechanic (although the game says the panther is supposed to be, it isn't and there are only like 2 points where its active anyway)			"

												I beat Strider a couple of days ago, and it was awesome.Being a big fan of metroidvania genre, I wanted to play this game for a really long time. I've heard that people were having problems with repeated crashes, frame-rate drops and some confusing level design, but on my playthrough of Strider I didn't notice any of that stuff, well, maybe some FPS drops, but I can't call game a bad one just because of that.It was refreshing, yet familiar experience. I haven't played a whole lot of previous Strider games, but in this one I felt right at home. Graphics were stunning, ambient sounds and music that played occasionally were giving me right feel at the right time - there was some perfect sound both for action and for atmosphere. Controls were solid, if a little too complicated, but once I got used to them, everything became just right. Kazakh City was decently big and really fun to explore with rich variety of zones, though, some areas like Underground were a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get to. I was aiming to collect every collectible besides large green containers (they're nothing but a health refill item anyway) and this led to some frustration, because some of the little Strider icons, which give you costumes, were really challenging to collect. Other than those, I loved collecting all the items, but I missed a few optional icons with concept art, which isn't a big deal.The core gameplay of Strider was fun and addictive, I spent hours just running around, killing bad guys in style and jumping on the rooftops like madman. Bosses were memorable and very challenging, except for Gravitrons (I was seriously just sitting in one spot and throwing exploding kunai at them until they broke). Final stage was epic and fight with Grandmaster Meio felt like complete joke after such a hard stage. Still, I enjoyed it and the victory was pretty sweet.The game was constantly throwing new stuff, enemies and objectives at me, helping to learn new tactics and kept me entertained until the very end.

												I have to say one of the best things about this game is that at the start you have so little at your disposal, and at the end you have a ton. Like, it can actually be hard to keep track of the exact tool to use for some situations, but I guess that's one of the reasons I had so much fun with this game. This game HIGHLY rewards exploration with its metroidvania-esque map layout and also makes the player learn and think on the fly with its highly entertaining boss battles. If you are a fan of metroidvania titles, like cyborg ninjas, or just want a fun game that brings to life aspects of classic gaming that made us all love games so much, then please pick this up!			"

IntroI love platformers like the Megaman series and ninja games where every move counts, challenging and rewarding at the same time. I love finding secrets and unlocking new moves, that's precisely why I wanted this game. Strider was fun to some extent especially the boss fights and the platforming system. You can climb on walls and even on ceilings. There is a reward system of course which presents you with new upgrades that adds you your weapon collection adding to the fun. However, the game lacks in many aspects and I will try to cover these in this review of the game. Shallow Fighting SystemThe whole game system encourages the player to rush through the enemies and end them as fast as possible which is expected of a ninja and should be good if implemented right, but the problem here is that enemies come in large quantities and spam you with bullets that stumbles the player. You may be able to play the game slowly and kill enemies without losing health but it will take forever, plus regular enemies are tough to beat and I don't mean tough to fight, the game makes them harder to crack when hit. Throughout the game, the only effective moves you'll be using is your normal sword strike or the charge strike. RepetitiveThe game is extremely repetitive, it reuses a lot of enemies and (you guessed it) it also uses the same bosses all to extend the length of the game. I have been playing this game for five hours and I'm still fighting the same soldiers that I met at the first level. I'm not even sure, they might have changed the color of their eyes but I'm pretty sure that they are the same except, now they are more in quantity and with various weapons to use. Adding cruelty to injury, sometimes they even use a shield to prevent you from passing which is really annoying to deal with. They also spawn back when you reenter the room.The Problem With Level DesignThe level design, the levels are well done and the platforming is fun. The placement of enemies is also clever and hard to pass without thinking of how to approach them. There are doors which require special keys to open and pass through and there are also secrets with rewards. But the problem is the foreground and the background are sometimes confusing. Especially when you play this game for the first time, you'll have trouble finding doors and vents without looking at your minimap. I find myself, most of the time, constantly looking at the minimap to make sure I didn't miss anything. Also, there is lack of variety in designing the levels. In a normal platformer, you expect a climate change, a day time a night time. These things are important to me and I think they keep things fresh for the player. The game changes environments but not much, it is all about fighting in a modern city, a factory or underground which all look like the same place to me.Many Worthless RewardsThe reward System, every now and then, the game rewards the player with new powers to use. My problem with this is that most of these rewards are mere keys to new areas. Most of them are useless in a fight and you'll be more inclined to use your sword in fights instead of wasting your energy on those moves. An example of a useless reward is the kuni, a ninja projectile used to throw at enemies and instantly kill them (supposedly). But instead, if you use it on enemies in this game it's like throwing stones at an armored soldier. Plus, it only can be thrown halfway through the screen and then disappears. The only useful thing about this item is that some locks are only activated by using it.ConclusionAt the end, Strider is a fun game and a good platformer. It offers great boss fights and will keep you active throughout the game. The game however is repetitive and sometimes doesn't reward the player properly. You might be playing this game for a while but be prepared to spam the same button over and over to defeat all your enemies. If I have to give it a score I would give it 5/10. I hope those issues are addressed in their next game, otherwise, I'm not buying it.			"

												Admittedly, it's really difficult to get me to get into a side-scrolling game. It's just something I've experienced so much, from puzzle games to fighting games to action games... Eventually, it starts to get stale. That's what I find so incredibly refreshing about this game. My impression shifted from 'this is way too simple' to 'this is crazy awesome' really, really fast.In terms of story and setting, I knew hardly anything about Strider, but this game throws you right into the fray in a heartbeat. There was so much to appreciate about this game at first. The art direction is gorgeous, for one, and the gameplay is bizarrely smooth. Each button tap of your weapon is a sword attack. Every single one. If you spam the 'X' button, you attack that many times --it's really one to one. Jumping felt a little wonky at first, but I quickly adapted to it, and once I did, I was warped into a crazy fluid combat experience.Admittedly, I was worried that 'jumping and sword slashing' would be all to the combat, but the game quickly provided me with a series of upgrades and attacks that really refreshed my palette. By mid-game, the combat was borderline addicting, and I could hardly put my controller down. Jumping back and forth, dodging attacks, reflecting bullets, switching elemental strengths and plunging in for a strike --it was all incredibly satisfying. To its detriment, though, this game is -really- difficult, particularly in some segments. I mean, I usually play games on hard rather than normal, because I think developers sometimes dumb games down for the masses, but even normal was a big challenge (Particularly a certain elevator that had me rage quit a few times.) Also, checkpoints. Don't think that just because you respawned before a boss fight means that if you turn off your game, your progress is saved. A couple of times, I had to restart half a level because I quit the game before another checkpoint without even realizing.That aside, though? It's a pretty good deal for a game that swept me away otherwise. You'll get maybe 6 hours if you blow through it, and 10 if you go secret-hunting. Get it for under $10, you'll not regret it.			"

												I did not know what to expect coming into Strider.  I only had a passing awareness of what the game was from AGDQ and Hiryu's likeness from other games.  So, no expectations.I have to say, though, that Strider is really good at what it is.  I went straight to the hardest difficulty and didn't have much trouble except for a few bosses, so it's not a difficult game, but it is a good game.  The level design is definitely that classic Metroidvania-style and the sheer number of collectables and power-ups provides plenty of reason to backtrack to get it all.There's not much enemy diversity and most of them can be felled by actually just mashing the attack button, but the game still rewards planning and awareness, especially through a few key sections that are basically bullet hells.  Some of the segments are basically puzzle-platformers, others are straight-on combat, and the variance is nice.  The game is paced well.My one major gripe with the game is a gravity mechanic that comes into play a few times (including the final boss fight).  The controls while in gravity fields are not intuitive, so I had to fight my instincts in order to get fluid movement.  This mechanic is only used three times in the entire game, so it's not game-wrecking, just an occasional annoyance.A good game.  I intend to 100% it soon.			"

												There is nothing original here and the mechanics are about as bland as they could be. It doesn't even attempt to capture the fast-paced acrobatic fun of the original arcade classic.Combat is simplistic and pointless; you can simply run through enemies while mashing the attack button. There's barely even any reason to kill them anyway, since they respawn the second the screen scrolls away. Overall I got bored of this game very quickly. There are so many better action games out there.			"

												Strider is a 1990s-style Metroidvania made with the technology and game design sensibilities of the 21st century. A solid and attractive platformer built around a rather nonsensical plot, the game runs the player through a variety of environments as they slowly unlock new abilities for the main character, allowing them to access more and more of the world in a fairly linear fashion.This game takes the design of Metroidvania games and does it much better. Backtracking? There isn’t much of it here; the game is designed to take the player on a linear route through the world, and while it feels nice and convoluted, the overall amount of backtracking is very minimal. This is an excellent piece of game design that many other Metroidvanias could learn from; the only real backtracking required is a few areas which have to be unlocked by later abilities.The core gameplay itself is pretty enjoyable. The platforming feels good, you can climb along the walls and ceilings, there aren’t too many bottomless pits, the enemies are reasonably varied, there are tons and tons of bosses (about one every half hour or so), with new enemies introduced like clockwork in the meanwhile. The game is always kept feeling fresh, and at the end, you get to put all your skills to work taking down the big bad.The game has decent voice acting, but the plot itself is pretty much nonsense; it isn’t really clear what is going on beyond “There is a bad guy who is in charge and you need to kill him.” Who sent Strider? Who are all these people? Why is the big bad doing what he is doing? Who knows? Who cares? It doesn’t matter!Your goal is to cut your way through his minions, and the game employs you admirably in this.Overall, this is a pretty great game. The graphics ae solid, the game is the right length for what it is and doesn’t feel stretched at about 9 hours to 100% it, the protagonist has a reasonably diverse set of skills which can be employed in a few different ways to make your way through the levels and beat down the bad guys – if I had a complaint, it would be that the standard game difficulty might have been a touch on the easy side at times, but overall, it wasn’t really an issue. Checkpoints were pretty generous and never really felt like they set you back too far even if you did fail.Was it perfect? No. But I had fun playing it, and the game had excellent pacing which kept me interested and kept me wanting to play after I got rolling through to the very end, even though it gave me many, many possible break points to choose from.All in all, this is a great reboot, and the game was really quite fun and was worth the 9 hours I invested. It isn’t something with a great story, but the core gameplay was pretty much exactly what I was hoping for from a game like this. "

												Strider is a painfully average game. It plays competently, but without an ounce of polish. Boss and platforming sections are the main highlights as there are very few regular enemy types and even fewer ways to combat them. Upgrades are scattered throughout levels to encourage exploration, though most upgrades either increase passive states or change the color of your weapon without doing much to change how you use them. Overall a fun, but brief game that you can play for 5-10 hours, then move on to something else. Overall worth about $5 to play.			"

												A modern revival of the old Capcom series, this game manages to revitalize Strider, while paying homage to the older games. Expect plenty of enemies, boss fights, secrets and upgrades, all while dashing and cutting your way through the end.Fast and fun gameplay, which maybe could have been deeper than it is, but it manages to keep you hooked until the end.Not very long, but replayable.Recommended.

												As someone who played the first Strider game on Sega Genesis, I can say this game is truly perfect. It starts with the modified version of the same music and cutscene that plays in the beginning of the first Strider. However, It's A LOT EASIER than the first game which I don't consider it a really bad thing. At least you can finish the game!Also, to be honest, I had a lot of fun playing this game; Just run and slash everything that stands in your way.If you like fast platforming games, I think you really need to try this game, And probably you will not be disappointed.

												This game is really fun  I havent had this much run and punch fun since Viewtiful Joe. Everything from the the power ups to the enemies to the bosses is super high octane fun. its not one of those games where ou get a power up for a specific level then never use it again. Your always swapping and youll always have that favourite that becomes your new default.  But its not perfect. For some reason the devs felt the need to kinda disregard everything you learn through out the game for the final boss. Where its this upside down confusing mess with more or less gimiky controls. As well as if your not a fan of new game + make a second save when you get to the final boss because the game will remove everything including items collected.			"

												Strider is a great game that any platformer, action-packed loving gamer should have in their collection. If you want to know much about this game, here are the points I have written in details, and I have avoided spoilers.:1/ Story: The game story is nice, albeit a little bit too simple, but sufficient enough.2/ Platforming: The puzzles, obstacles in the game are well-designed. You will need to acquire the skills in the game to get past a lot of obstacles. The Devs really have thoroughly put their thoughts and mind into designing these obstacles. 3/ Exploration: As you play in a huge city, Strider is full of places to visit if you decide not to stick to the guide and instruction from the game. Try wandering around the city on your own, you will discover a huge lot of fun things to do.However, bear in mind that this is merely a little open-world type of game. There won't be side-quests. And sometimes if you happen to be in somewhere you haven't been before, or re-visited randomly, there may be boss battles, so prepare yourself well. But don't worry, the game won't put you into a random boss battle if it doesn't know you have the skills required to enter that battle.But after you get some skills, you could go around and try visiting the old places to get more power-ups. If you are afraid that you might get lost, use the Maps.4/ Maps: However, sometimes, you will need to do some zoom-in and out for the Maps. I did had a problem with the Map when trying to switch from one area to another, since the Map of another area might disappear from the screen, and you could not see anything. In this case, I would recommend trying move the arrow keys around, try zoom-in and zoom-out, you will get over this problem easily.5/ Power-ups, upgrades: Strider offers a good variety of power-ups you will need to win the combat. From Ice, Flame, to Magnetic, Kunai, Option A-B-C (you will figure it out what they are) or skills such as Projectile Reflecting with your sword... and much more, it's definitely great to play such as a game with so many things you can use to deal with the enemies. These upgrades will also help you in exploring the city. And using them to get to strange places you have never been to before.6/ Combat + Boss: Definitely the best points to talk about. If there's anything I would recommend, it would be going for the Hard mode when you start playing the game.Trust me, it's gonna be one huge fun to do. That's what I did when I first played this game. Going for the Hard mode in Strider not only makes you realize how much important it is to explore the city to get more power-ups, costumes (did I mention there are 11 awesome costumes in this game?), concept art.. but also to make you prepare yourself harshly for go into the battle with the Bosses.For 1 or 2 first bosses of the game, you will feel like the game is pretty harsh on your Health, since the Bosses at Hard mode are no joke, they mean serious business if you don't master your dodging and sword slicing skill well enough. But after getting your hands on some Energy and Health upgrades, you will realize the Boss battles are much gonna be easier. They will only have one or two fatal strikes at you. So try Hard mode, it's totally encouraging. Even the damage of normal minions, enemies are gonna be a lot strong, so try to get a lot of upgrades. By the time you reach the Final Boss, believe me, the Final Boss would not be hard to finish.As for the Combat: I would state it in two words ""Button Mashing"". I can spoil you on this one, but it means, in the boss battle, if you want to win (Well, I'm still talking about Hard mode) without letting yourself getting killed fast by the Bosses' damage, you would do well to hit those guys as fast as you could. Since the number of consecutive hits on them do matters in this game, hit them fast will help you increase your own damage. Therefore, you will have pressed a button, like , 200-300 times after this game, and that's ok :DWell, that's about everything I can tell you. I totally would play this game all over again. Because Strider is a great game. And it's gonna be totally worthy of your own money.Score: 9.5/10. -0.5 because of the Maps >.>			"

Strider's controls are intuitive and fun to use as you rip your way through enemies as the unstoppable force you are.My only complaint so far is that the characters do not move their mouths or have almost any sort of facial expression when they talk - unsure if this was done intentionally - however, it does dampen the experience slightly.No matter, as the cut scenes are quick to pass and you're back into the action.I rate it 9/10. Should you buy at full price or wait for it to go on sale? I say you could wait for a sale - but it's definitely worth full price if you decide you can't wait.			"

												Holy crap, I can't believe I debated on whether to buy this game.  Got it on the Daily Deal for 4 and a half bucks, then proceeded to play for 3 and a half hours straight.  Great fun.This game reminds me of when I was a kid, and playing those great Nintendo and Sega platformers that you couldn't wait to get home from school to play.  Not so much because it's Strider, but because it doesn't try to be ""Next-Gen"", and just focuses on great gameplay.  There's no weird sh*t or gimmicks to pull your attention away.It's also not a heavy lift - controls are precise and simple.  This is a game with a lot of hidden stuff, but it also WANTS you to find that hidden stuff.  There's some backtracking involved to get to hidden items (like when you gain a new ability, and so can reach/break a previously unreachable/unbreakable doorway), but it never comes off as tedious.Well worth the cost, even at full price.

												Pretty fun, but some nitpicks.1. Kind of short (I got almost everything in the game in about 8-9 hours)2. Inconsistent difficulty (Starts off balanced, gets fairly difficult, then becomes extremely easy, save a couple of boss fights and some incredibly annoying combinations of enemies, plus Meio is a pain to fight given how his arena is built)3. Weapons are rather unbalanced (Reflect (red) plasma is entirely outclassed by the other three, I just left explosive/fire on unless I needed to cheese something with homing kunai or slowly chip my way through a line of stunlock laser soldiers with the ice sword since explosive does the most damage)4. Movement can be really finicky and annoying in some situations (The plasma catapult has a weird hop on the end of its animation that can get you killed, Strider will stick to any wall he gets too close to so you can get killed trying to hop down a small gap such as in the Meio fight, some knockdown and stagger animations don't end unless you hit the ground requiring you to climb back up a huge room due to one enemy, those freeze-canister spider droids can easily stunlock you to death with spammed attacks since there's no stunlock protection, etc)Otherwise, it's a really solid, fun game with some challenging platforming, fun boss fights, and great combat. Plus, it's pretty cheap.			"

												Repetitive action gameplay with clean controls and an infuriating knockback mechanic. As a strider game, it is OK. (Recommend)As a metroidvania game, it is quite disappointing. (Do NOT recommend)PROS:-Clean controls-Good boss fights-Variety of collectiblesNEUTRALS:-Different weapon types don't really do anything different (except the freeze)-No real combat mechanics. The entire game you just mash  to swing your sword, and once you have kunais you also mash to throw those at the same time. Over and over. -Maybe 3 or 4 ""actual"" enemy types? (Wall cannons, soldiers w/ and w/o shields, and the 6 legged bot guys)CONS:-INCREDIBLY ANNOYING KNOCKBACK MECHANIC withOUT invul frames.....expect to get annoyed being knocked down cliffs, etc, and towards the end of the game you will get mini-chain stunned on the harder difficulty. -Metroidvania elements are barely implemented. Yes there are levels with collectibles strewn about, but the only thing preventing you from accessing them is colored doors (which can be opened by the various weapon types). There are very few hidden items (for example, one requires you to freeze a number of enemies and use them as stepping stones to cross a large gap....this type of hidden item is extremely rare in the game). Usually you just get the weapon, open the matching door, and upgrades voila.-No fast travel mechanic (although the game says the panther is supposed to be, it isn't and there are only like 2 points where its active anyway)			"

												I'm not a big fan of classic Strider but I really dug this game. It's a neat marriage of the fast-paced slashy gameplay of the original and a Metroid-esque structure. Really good game with great, fluid and fun controls. The only real complaint I have is that the bosses kind of suck. If you try to learn their patterns they'll often blow you away with powerful attacks, but if you just go right up to them and mash buttons you'll almost always win. It's also sort of easy but not insultingly so. Those points aside it's highly recommended, it's a quick, frenetic and thoughtful platformer that doesn't wear out its welcome.			"

												Represents one of the dumbest missed opportunities I've seen in about 25 years of gaming: Make a ""metroidvania"" style game, don't offer any way to fast travel back and forth across the map. As soon as I discovered this, I quit playing the game. When your gameplay design is heavily based on backtracking to open new areas with new abilities, it's a serious design omission not to include some way to quickly move around the map.			"

Gem of a game that never lets up, High speed high tension action with some rudimentary puzzle solving along with Metriodvania exploration makes a great combo and they definately pulled it off right with this one.

												While I did enjoy this game, it comes with a few things that to me felt like grievous issues.Cons:Camera - The camera is almsot always fine, but in a few boss fights it zooms in and out at horrible times and pulls away from the boss to follow Strider.  It's even worse around gravity globes you can run on, which are their own irritating issue that just becomes more annoying.No invincibility frames - A few normal enemies and a few boss attacks have their entire gimmick around this and squeezing as much damage as possible in one volley or chain stuns.  Easily a quarter or more of a fully upgraded health from one of those, or just getting pinballed between 2-4 enemies for a few seconds while you wait for the chance to have control again.Other smaller issues involve the final tower level being a boring difficulty spike and that wall climbing has you suddenly mantle up and over from a bit too generous of a distance.  Also there's an entire level where you run against the wind meaning you walk slow and jump short distances; meh.The Good:Movement is amazing.  Running, dashing, jumping, and sliding around while slashing everything in sight is solid and the best part of the game.  Worth a playthrough alone just to hop around and hit stuff really.The Metroidvaia aspect feels tacked on with four flavors (ice, fire, reflect, magnetic/ranged) to the dash, slash, and kunais, but overall is fun while you do a little backtracking here and there and have a dramatic pose animation that plays each time you pick up an upgrade.  Also ignore the story.  Not because the story is really bad, but because it's just in the way of the fun and makes deaths to bosses involve watching another boring taunt speech.For all of the negatives, I do still recommend this game oddly.  It's that much fun to play when the quirks aren't getting in your face.			"

												Strider is a good game that I would recommend whether you love Metroidvanias or not. Maybe not the best of that genre, but good. Movement felt very slow at first and still felt a bit slow towards end. 100% find is quite difficult and traversing back through areas were challenging due the map not showing you were exits went and there is no fast travel. Normal was pretty easy, and uninterested in trying hard mode. Boss fights were pretty easy (normal), as I only had to retry less than a handful of them.			"

												Yeah it is pretty damn good. Story wise this is a remake of the original arcade game. However it is a totally different game opting for the metroidvania style instead and that is a welcome change. This and Killer Instinct are the games that turned Double Helix's name around for the better and shows that the devleoper are pretty good at delivering a decent game after all and I wish them the best.  As I said the game is good, basic but effective metroidvania exploration, pretty visuals, and satisfying combat with a character we have not seen for years and may not see again for many more make this a title worth recommending.

												One thing I've learned about video games over the years is that the story doesn't matter in the slightest in the face of gameplay, and few big-name games these days carry that sentiment.Strider is one such game.The game starts, and you immediately get thrown into the action with zero exposition; this immediately highlights Striders core gameplay: the combat. The combat is fun, fast, fluid, f-intuitive, and it blends very well with movement around the area, as Hiryu can attack in virtually all directions, even in movement.Admittedly, I finished the game and I still don't fully understand what was what in the overall plot, but I don't care because the gameplay is fun enough that I would play it a second time.

												I got this game expecting to be the very arcade style with short levels full of action. While that's not what I got, the metroidvania style fits well with Strider's mechanics. Despite the big maps you can travel quick and kill enemies quicker. The game also rewards skilled players with a special metter making you stronger for a short time, so is not just rushing through.There's really no much else to point out. The story is super simple with plain cutscenes but the series wasn't known for its plot. And like many of its genre there's a good bunch of upgrades and collectables to look for. Overall a very solid game that won't disappoint both newcomers and veterans of the series.			"

												Strider by Double Helix is a great side scrolling adventure, the game features crisp controls a variety of abilites, power-ups, tough yet reachable achievements and a few good play throughs. The design and methods our crafty Ninja Hero Hiryu goes about climbing, flipping, slicing, dicing, teleporting, and projecting himself through the multiple levels of this game is a blast, the action, the pace, the difficulty at not getting hit, loading up your cypher sword and going all out on some unfortunate Meio kronies is a thrilling ride...for awhile.One of the achievements and probably the most worrisome is the complete in 4 hours achievement - this is totally possible on any setting as the games areas to travel and places to go are limited, with the help of a few maps from online you can plot a course that will take you directly or almost near direct paths with almost all power ups to beat the game in 4 hours. I completed it in 3:05 and think I missed 1 power up.Strider had very few cons, I think 3 overall:The first and biggest one is that Double Helix the designer of the game is no longer in business. Strider has such a comfortable blend of action, evasion, and puzzles while it glides along quickly enough that you can beat it in under 4 hours once youve honed your skill. The Second con would be that is it such a short game, there are some extra modes like survival where you try to survive wave after wave of enemies or the time trials where you run around the maps hitting beacons in a certain time frame to collect A - F rank, but they got old quick. The Third is the Direct X, if you dont have DX11 it cant run on your machine, some people have posted about this, and there is supposedly patches (unofficial patches)- youve been warned.If your a platform player this is a must, wait for a sale and enjoy. If you dont usually play platform style games and seek a top of line experience in this genre with top notch quality and representation - Strider is a excellent choice.			"

												Well-built Metroidvania game with as much focus on plot as I imagine the original NES game had (none). Feels ultra responsive and withstanding a couple of exceptions plays very well. When you're on a wall, you can't melee below you. Really seems like they just didn't have time to implement it. Gameplay is definitely the strongest part and as you pick up skills it becomes varied and challenging. Exploration is rewarded and the levels are very well designed. Complex but I never felt stuck nor accidentally backtracked though you are generally able to.Looks pretty nice. Voice acting and remnants of plot are mostly atrocious. Would almost be better if it was just silent. Music could have been cooler too. I guess like.. the game didn't really have much character and felt super generic and the bosses and well everything had no context. The game is good, but I feel it will be fairly forgettable.			"

												STRIDER's visuals and theme are not my style. It tends to feel a bit button-mashy as times, as well, which really turns me off. On top of that, you acquire a weapon about 1/3 of the way through the game that you simply spam to beat nearly every boss afterwards. The exploration is also a bit tedious. All that said, STRIDER provides you with a lot of fun weapons to play with, has a straightforward progression system, and plays faster than any Metroidvania title I've experienced to date. It's a solid offering if you're looking for something different.  "

Strider is a good action game, but a lame Metroidvania. Strider is a reboot of... well, the Strider franchise. Strider was a dose of intense arcadey goodness, and when I heard it was rebooted as a Metroidvania, I was pretty surprised, but ready to give it a chance.On the side of action, the game succeeds. Unfortunately, there's not a lot I can say that speaks to this. It feels as flashy and wild as it should. Bosses are frantic, enemies are dynamic, and the abilities you acquire are fun and empowering, kunais, dashes, new blade types, etc. My only real complaints here are that at the occasional gravity warping sections within the game, you never feel quite as in control as you should, and that switiching blade types on the fly can feel stressful. Oh, and turning around is kind of weird? But anyway. Graphically, it's exactly what it should be, throwbacks to the old games show up in proper spaces, but also aren't carbon copies. The soundtrack is actually really sick, unfortunately it is turned down too low to appreciate, like a lot of soundtracks nowadays. I recommend cranking it up a little! But otherwise, the combat is nice, the presentation works. Playtime is around five hours, and that's just about the right length. It all checks out.But then we get to the fact that, again, this game is a Metroidvania. That means backtracking to get collectibles with new found power ups. But the issue with Strider's layout is that backtracking is genuinely annoying to go through. There are only a few warp points in the game, and they are far out of the way from the ""Plaza"" (the place you consistently return to over the game). The collectibles, too, are almost never worth going to get, with the exception of a few upgrades to your health and mechanical upgrades. Furthermore, rather than in a, well, GOOD Metroidvania, you aren't led silently to where you need to go to next by map design and the designer's invisible hand. You're given a waypoint on the map to head to. What was the point of making this a Metroidvania, then? If the areas were stacked in order, the game would have felt relatively the same, though a bit funky to backtrack through small parts of areas. I often feel compelled to collect everything I can in games like this, but in Strider, I just didn't bother. They're not hard to get, usually, theyre just not worth it. I didn't want to waste my time.That being said, Strider is still a fun game. The action is frenetic and fun, but I'm honestly hesitant to recommend it. I actually felt like it wasted my time often when playing it. This is one of those many times I wish I could give a middling review score rather than the binary of ""Yes"" or ""No"". It's a good action game, but whenever it tries to be like a Metroid game, it just becomes boring. Buy at your own discretion.			"

												It's Strider. It's awesome. It's great. If you like the Metroidvania genre, Strider is a great game that you'll most likely find enjoyable.			"

												Not a big fan of platformers or ninja games, my last ninja game was Onimusha for PS2, but this one is enjoyable, it can be a bit confusing to travel from one area to another, and then you try to pick up from where you left last time you played.			"

												I played strider games on all sega Consoles, playstation and pc platforms and i really loved the gameplay, also the manga origin of it was a great masterpiece... what really shaped this reboot though is that they implemented strider Hiryu moves from Marvel VS Capcom series, gave them a new look and only can be unlocked as the story goes, great game and it has the ability to run on 60 fps if you got the hardware for it which is not really high.although i wished that there was a Japanese audio option because his voice basically is way better in japanese.

												Pretty solid modernized version of Strider with Metroid-like level progression, though I wouldn't consider it a fully fledged metroidvania game since exploration aspect in this game is pretty pale. Takes around 7 hours to 100%. Navigation outside of main objectives isn't very fun and there aren't any real points of interest besides color-coded locked doors which usually hide a power-up or concept art unlock.Game itself is more combat oriented and that's where is shines. All animations are fast and don't cancel anything (e.g. you can jump, throw kunai and power up your slash at the same time), plus you get 4 different attack types that change how your combat moves behave, neither mode is a direct upgrade but instead they compliment each other (e.g. use reflective mode to reflect bullets while you run torwards the enemy, switch to magnetic mode and dash to stun them, and then switch to flame mode to finish the stunned enemy off). Most locked doors are opened by a dash so you don't have to pause while moving from area to area either. There are no pauses during movement or combat, it feels very streamlined and fast-paced.Visuals are nice and clean, have a nice style (e.g. some effects like dust or explosions look more hand-drawn than realistic), but nothing to write home about. Enemies telegraph their shots and projectiles are very easy to see. Bosses make great use of projectiles, something you would see in old arcade games. Bosses in this game are in general very fun and challenging, and urge you to move a lot, unlike some other modern metroidvania games (*cough*Shadow Complex*cough*).One thing that puzzles me is complete lack of facial animations during cutscenes. It's not noticable on Hiryu and some other characters that wear masks, but it looks very cheap on characters that don't.Some issues with the game: Game is locked at 60 fps. You can't remap keys in-game, but you can do so by editing config files. Non-XInput controllers are supported only through third-party means (x360ce). Controls during segments that have non-standard gravity are just plain bad both on keyboard and controller, but these segments are rare and it doesn't ruin them completely.			"

												- The controls arent very tight.- It feels like your constantly playing on the ice level from Super Mario.- Basic movement is a chore.- Climbing walls is very rigid and clunky.- The control scheme is very poor and cant be rebinded.- The fact that mobs can infinitely hit stun you to death because you need a charge attack to kill them is also a pain.- There is also a chance that when you fall into a pit and it respawns you that you will respawn inside a wall, and have no choice but restart the game.+ The boss fights are fun though, and this game is still alright, but overall it just gives me a headache.
