												hi! this review mainly serves to inform buyers about the differences between the PC version of this game, and the console version which it is a port version of.i have played both PC and console (PS3) versions of the game. i played the PS3 version at launch and PC version this year.PC Pros:+ ALICE supports graphics enhancing injectors such as SweetFX, so if you are comfortable using this type of program and have the specs for it, you can have a higher graphical quality experience than is at all possibly attainable on the PS3 (and despite the slightly outdated graphics, this is still an awesome game from an aesthetic perspective!)+ if your hobby is sceenshotting games, or even recording gameplay videos, it's probably a no-brainer due to this that you would want a PC copy of ALICE simply because it's a lot more convenient and doesn't rely on the preset specs of a clunky console.+ if you don't mind adding some quick lines of code (see comments for how) to the config files of the game (which you can do with any txt-type word processor) this will also unlock many preset outfits for Alice to wear as alternates to her story-mode outfits, and these come with interesting buffs and debuffs (for harder and easier mode play)+ in general: the emotiveness, clever dialogue and creativity of the entire game is ever-present, and both the combat and noncombat scenarios are often blissfully relaxing as they are at other times a trifle vexing.PC Cons:- the game was supposed to come with a ""bonus"" hidden file containing the original American McGee's Alice game in addition to ALICE MADNESS... unfortunately, most copies of the game don't, and this apparently includes both origin & steam digital versions. a physical copy of the game called ""complete collection"" is the only way to get the 1st game bundled with this one (thanks @groen90)- unfortunately this game is licensed to Electronic Arts, which means it comes with a ton of awkward and invasive DRM, including the requirement to make an EA/ Origin account. i had no problem registering for this but nobody likes DRM, and nobody likes EA.- there is an UNPATCHED and potentially GAMEBREAKING bug relating to the 'Umbrella' weapon that some, but not all, players will encounter with the PC version. this bug is usually caused by remapping the keybindings from default to *anything else* but if you are prepared to deal with it, you CAN fix the bug and play with custom binds (which i do)this bug has been around for 4+ years and never fixed by EA, so if you plan to buy this game then *PLEASE* be prepared to deal with it as it may occur around the 20~60 minutes of play mark depending on how fast you go through the game world.there are many fixes for this bug, but it will require you to rewrite some lines of code in the .cfg files and do a bit of gametesting (it happened to me, but with help from the internet it was self-fixed and i have been playing with no errors ever since)i don't remember this bug being existent on the PS3 version of Alice. i do love this game, but hopefully these things will help you make your mind up. review may be addended later to be more concise~			"

												I like how the developers took a more ""animated"" style for this (though some may not). The colors in the backgrounds and scenery can range from absolutely breath-taking, to horrifically morbid (in a good way). The character and level design is also very unique and while somewhat cartoonish, this only helps serve the purpose of resulting in a very creative and imaginative piece of art.Now, despite it's beauty, the game is also filled to the brim with what we all want: violence! It pretty much is a ""hack-n-slash,"" type game, however there are also plenty of power-ups and abilities that can be used to ""spice things up"" a bit.Platforming feels solid. Double jumping not only looks beautiful with a cool graphical flourish but the ""float"" ability that allows you to glide and string multiple double jumps together is useful and cool to look at. The fighting is also done really well. I like dedicated melee and ranged buttons that allow the combat to flow seamlessly instead of constantly switching weapons back & forth as the situation and enemies demand a major improvement over the first. Theres also a dodge/dash ability that's both very useful and is awesome to look at. Locking on to enemies to and being able to change to another target during battle is very useful.The environments were stunning, from a beautiful forest, to menacing castle, and even the streets of London! Most games stick to one theme, such as being dark and scary to the end, or bright and happy, etc. Alice: MR had instances of gorgeous and serene, contrasting to the dark and ominous. They were the things of a beautiful, daydreaming nightmare!If your idea of a good game is one that involves stultifying realism, empty action, and hollywood cliches then odds are that you will not like this game. If your tastes go beyond that to the appreciation of literature, art, and above all imagination then this game should prove to be quite satisfactory.			"

												Short Version:Pros:+ Beautiful art design+ Interesting story+Controlling Alice feels great+Combat stays fresh for most of the game+ Enemies' design is amazing+ Voice acting is mostly good throughout the game+ Tons of collectibles+ Cool weapons+ Great soundtrack+ Weapon upgradesCons:- Repetitive puzzles- Stale platforming- Annoying camera- Level design is as linear as linear gets- Tons of invisible walls- Some game breaking bugs - Getting stuck, getting knocked down and never getting up again (which means you will not die and have to restart)- Impressively boring if played for more than 20/30 minutes (longer periods of play)- The absence of the original's weapons still haunts me (Deck of Cards, Jacks, Demon Dice, etc.)""Long"" Version:When you start playing ""Alice Madness Returns"", it is quite evident that its art design is unique and downright beautiful. Personally, I think this game is already worth checking out at least once just for its art direction. It starts out with beautiful, calm and bright landscapes - which are really colorful and highly detailed; once♥♥♥♥♥♥starts hitting the fan, that beautiful Wonderland turns into something ghastly, corrupted and quite disturbing - the catch is, it's equally appealing. As stated, eye-candy is abundant from start to finish and you will have many opportunities to catch your breath and take some beautiful screenshots.Platforming is a big part of ""Alice Madness Returns"" and it seems it gets worse as the game goes on. The problem is that one can only pull so many levers before getting bored. The level design plays a vital role here; it is extremely linear and you are pretty much getting from point A to point B with little to no side objectives - collectibles alleviate this by making you go off your main path; unfortunately, by the end of the game, you will most likely find yourself ignoring some (if not most) of them, since they required YET another lever and a couple more jumps and floats.Story-wise, this game shines. The story is nothing to write home about but it does a decent enough job of making you wanting to keep playing - I guess it ends quite abruptly but still, it's good in my opinion. It manages to keep you invested in Alice's ""quest"" and the use of ""Alice in Wonderland""'s characters was refreshing (even though the first game did it better).Voice acting is, as said, really good. You meet your fair share of looney characters with high pitched voices and your dark enemies have intimidating voices and sound effects. The soundtrack is great. I think it is the kind of soundtrack I would buy if it was available. Weapon sounds also feels great as you cut enemies in halt and fill their♥♥♥♥♥♥s with (peppered) lead.Combat stays fresh for most of the game. Enemies require different strategies to be defeated and later on there are multiple types of enemies at the same time which requires you to adapt accordingly to the enemies weaknesses.You have 4 weapons (or 5 if you count the umbrella) at your disposal and, even though I wanted more weapons, including some from the original game, they are enough to keep the combat engaging. Being able to upgrade them with Teeth (in-game currency) is also a bonus since you can turn your fluffy looking Hobby Horse into a full-fledged fire breathing stallion of punishment and death or your traditional Pepper Grinder into a.... full-fledged fire breathing... cooking..... tool.... ..... of punishment and death.However, the camera tends to flip out during combat and changing targets is a shore, usually costing you a chunk of your health.Invisible walls are everywhere, some small holes and gaps where Alice could easily fit in are regarded as impossible to cross and, considering the game is ""quite"" recent, it is something I found both annoying and disappointing. They are everywhere.I made a mistake while playing this game. I thought ""I am going to play this for 2 or 3 hours"" and let me tell you that it is something I sincerely do not recommend you to do.Most levels go like this: Jump, jump, jump and float; pull a lever/switch; more platforms show up; you can jump some more just to pull yet another lever; once you reach a bigger platform, you will have a battle; once you finish off all the enemies, more platforms show up. You then put a Bomb on a pressure pad so the platforms don't disappear and make your way to the other side well before the bomb detonates; then you will jump some more and pull some more levers... Sounds repetitive? That's because it is! I believe, after the first 2 hours or, let's say, 2/3 levels, this game gets on your nerves fairly quickly. I recommend it in short bursts.But still, this may sound bad and all but Alice moves so effortlessly that the platforming sections feel graceful. It feels great even though it eventually gets boring.Some other bugs break the experience a little bit. One example is when you jump on a mushroom (it acts like a trampoline), you can only move again once Alice reaches the top of her ascension and starts falling down again; if you were pressing forward when you were going up, you will need to press it again after Alice starts descending so she moves forward - have fun dying because of it, since you will find yourself wasting extra jumps in the air while standing still.For me, ""Alice Madness Returns"" is a big disappointment, yet, I can't bring myself to hate it.Here's the thing: I wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, I found myself getting frustrated and bored for a big chunk of its 14 or so hours of story.Is it worth buying? Not for 10 €. I would suggest 75% off, considering the game's age. But still, if you like engaging stories and value art design in video games, 5 € should be ok as well. It is a game everyone should experience at least once!As far as replay value goes... I think you will only be playing this once.This game had so much potential. It could have been something as epic as ""Batman: Arkham City"". That's what makes me sad.Score: 6.5 out of 10.			"

												When American McGee's Alice[en.wikipedia.org] came out in 2000, it was one of many shots in the arm that gaming received back then (the original Half-Life and Deus Ex to name a couple), showcasing the idea that videogames could aim for higher and higher levels of creativity and ambition. The mythology of Alice, Lewis Carroll's inquisitive young heroine thrust into a psychedelic kaleidoscope of strange yet unsettlingly familiar characters, has changed hands and changed costumes many, many times since Carroll penned Alice's Adventures In Wonderland[en.wikipedia.org] and Through The Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There[en.wikipedia.org] at the end of the 19th century. I personally love the original story and that's pretty much where my head first goes when Alice is mentioned. I don't think the gentle whimsy of Carroll's writing can ever be matched when it comes to the denizens and riddles of Wonderland. But even the malevolent nonsense of the poem ""Jabberwocky""[www.jabberwocky.com], for example, never saw anything like American McGee's vision of Wonderland. The original game took many of the story's elements and twisted them up in fantastically demented ways and delivered the New and Improved Alice to us with flashy, blistering combat and a dark tone that was most certainly a product and an extension of the 1990s with their Hot Topic meets The Crow meets The Matrix mélange of gothy, trendy edginess. I'm not knocking that (okay, I am a little) because God knows I was cheerfully invested in it myself back then, but it is what it is. So, with that out of the way, enter Alice: Madness Returns.I can't really talk about the story too much without spoiling anything, but this isn't really a spoiler if you happened to notice the actual title of the game, so let's just say our gal Alice is, in fact, nuts. Insane in the membrane. Mad, you could say. And as she winds her way alternately through a dirty, dark London skid-row and a troubled, hurriedly collapsing Wonderland on a quest to solve a mystery and save her sanity, it becomes obvious, like in the first game, that as bonkers as she is, there are crazier -- and scarier -- things about, oh yes. Which is of course the main draw of a game like this. How bizarre can we get? Well, let's see. There's steampunk taxidermy gone horribly wrong, various ill-thought ways to use baby dollheads, an impressively grotesque and bloody take on The Walrus and The Carpenter, an entire level that feels like the drug-addled fever dream of M.C. Escher and Wes Craven locked in some padded cell together, and I think you even walk through a giant mouth at one point. And not in a Disneyland kind of way. Concerning the neverending search for weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ Alice delivers whole-heartedly. (Imagine me saying that while holding a pink, veiny, pulsing heart while twitching and grinning insanely.)As spectacle, it satisfies. I loved the originality of the levels and the many, many weirdnesses it serves up. I won't say anything about the story because, no real way around it, it does take a second place to the gameworld, the atmosphere, and the characters, but it doesn't help that it's really not all that great to begin with. It doesn't do anything necessarily wrong, and the voice acting is pretty good (especially Alice's), but it doesn't really do anything amazingly right, either. It's pretty much what you'd expect if you've played the previous installment. Disappointing, a bit, but whatever. Again, the story can be excused for taking a backseat to the visuals just because of the game that it is.Combat and gameplay... oh boy. Good points: melee feels GREAT. I want a Vorpal Blade in real life. I never got tired of dancing and blitzing that blade through the air. It's great fun. Other weapons are good too, in varying degrees, but sending Alice dodging through enemy attacks to be able to slash viciously back at them and then dodging away, in a beautifully animated burst of indigo butterflies, never ever gets old. Ranged combat? Not... so... great. Irritating controls requiring quick-switching targeting modes that also partially disable your camera make for some very frustrating battles, especially ones involving tons of airborne and ground enemies at once. No, sir, I do not like it.But then again, the Vorpal Blade is really, really sweet. So it's a mixed bag. And that honestly sums up my overall feelings on the game because while, like I already said, the levels are visually fantastic and new, the levels are also INCREDIBLY long and drawn-out. I mean, I like getting a lot of game for my money, but there's a point where you can almost hear the devs running out of ideas for a certain level or world and sad to say the game just sails right past that point into exasperated tedium. But that's me. Your mileage may vary, and very possibly will.In the end, this has everything you'd expect from a concerted effort to take your childhood and turn it inside-out and sideways and then tell you to kill it and smash it and blow it to shreds. As Alice herself might say, ""Curiouser and curiouser! And completely covered in blood."" "

												HOW TO FIX GAME CODE:Pretty simple install the game and when it pops up the code you need copy it, go to ea.comClick on my account and sign into it (this would be your origin login or whatever, or if you need create an account.)Click on the tab redeem code, and paste the code you copied from steam. Should activate.Then go back to steam launch the game log into your EA account and your off to playI've had this game on xbox 360 but picked it up during a sale, super fun 3rd person game, love the art style and the gameplay, overwall recommend the game. Also the game has a 30 fps cap, but with a quick INI file change you can unlock the framerate. Hope I helped!			"

												A beautiful game. I truly mean every word when I say: Every environment is stylized, enchanting, made of peculiar objects born within Alice's mind. It makes truly amazing and unique landscapes. The enemies too are very well done.The music is amazing too, many songs I will remember.It has flaws, the combat, while fairly fun, is simple, there are few combos, you can change between your melee weapons while hitting, so it's nothing disastrous, it's fairly solid, but it does get repetitive. The game is also plagued with random minigame segments. Thanks to EA pushing the studio for early release.Still, the game is amazing, the story is one of the most ballsy a game could have. It is one of my favorites. Get this small masterpiece.			"

												The overall quality of Alice: Madness Returns is high, despite it feeling rushed. The qualities that made American McGee's Alice so enjoyable-the gory hack-'n'-slash combat, the gorgeous design, the rich dialogue, the menacing mood-are present and abundant.Alice: Madness Returns is a dream come true for fans of American McGee's Alice. It's a worthy heir and at the same time a fully modern game that can vie with the best contemporary representatives of this genre. It's long, it's difficult, it's rewarding and enchanting.Alice: Madness Returns is a wolf in sheep's clothing. This game may look honest and cute, but it's cruel and bloody.Alice: Madness Returns may not win awards for genre innovation, but it's the most darkly fun and gloriously batty game I've played.It's not perfect, but it's as close to the definition of masterpiece as it could be. A thrilling and exciting adventure to the dark corners of Wonderland.			"

												A frantic third person action game featuring a darker version of Lewis Carrol's Alice. Or maybe it was already dark enough until disney molested the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it because you know, for kids. The sequel picks up years after the original where Alice is a grown woman now, having defeated the madness that plagued her mind. Or so it seems. Wherever it lacks in variety and innovation, it makes up with numerous gorgeous places to explore, bizzare characters and enemies to meet, and a captivating story that unfolds itself through Alice's madness in the most beautiful and sinister way at the same time. American McGee did it again just like he did with the original game over a decade ago. A must for the fans of the original; newcomers, tread carefully.7/8			"

I found an interesting little forced login screen, well thankfully I already had an EA login so I logged in it asked for a product code I put in a product code, the same one I have always had since I purchased this game, to my wonderous surprise the code was rejected.Its a splendidly Mad World when companies like EA can steal products you owned for years out from under you. Don't buy this game stay away from EA get refunds if you canedit-I was able to get it working by signing on to my origin and activating the code there.that besing said others are nto so fortunate, and the fact of the matter is I should not have to jump through this many hoops to play a game I have owned for a long while and have not had to do this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on.For those that can get it working yes I would recommend this game its a fun and beautiful game dripping with artistic style, but for those unfortunate to be stuck up a creek without a paddle refund it			"

Alice: Madness Returns ReviewGame DetailsPublished by: Electronic ArtsDeveloped by: Spicy HorseGenre: Action/AdventureRelease Date: 17 Jun, 2011Metacritic Score: 75 (Link[www.metacritic.com])Game Review""I'm not insane! I didn't kill my family. I am fine. I'm not mad, I'm innocent - I mean, not guilty!"" - AliceWhat a little gem this is. In Alice: Madness Returns you control Alice Liddell, a girl who suffers from an emotional trauma caused by the death of her parents. To get rid of the trauma and learn the truth of her past, she once falls again into Wonderland, where a new evil force has corrupted it.The strongest attribute of this game is Wonderland itself. This creepy and dark vision of Wonderland is beautifully recreated in this game. The art design in it is top notch, and graphical wise it does it job well, even though there are some places here and there with some ugly textures. As you progress the game you will get to new areas of Wonderland, each one of it with its art style, which makes it feel less repetitive. Menus are also slick, easy to navigate, a negative being that in video menu you have almost no options of configuring the game graphically, you have to do your tweaks through the config file unfortunately.Sound is also pretty good, nothing mind blowing, but it does its job well enough. The voice acting its great as the soundtrack, but the second one can get repetitive very often.Gameplay wise, which its the most important factor in a game to me, is where this game falls a little flat. Controls are great, smooth and easy to use (I used a ps3 controller[/b]). Length is also a strong point in this game. Its not huge, but it is almost the perfect length to keep you interested during the game, with tons of collectibles to catch and areas to find. I spent about 12 hours to complete it and did not get all the collectibles, only about an half of them. You also have a neat diversity of weapons which make the combat more fun.Now to the negative things in the gameplay. The worse part its that the game gets very repetitive because it does not evolve much from the start. At some point, you will get to do the same tasks all over again till the end which makes the game a bit boring sometimes. Also the puzzles and other tasks to change the pace of the game are not very fun. Even less fun when they also start to get repetitive.The combat is very fluid and responsive, fast paced as well with a good variety of horrendous enemies to confront, but once you master it it becomes very easy.Acrobatics are also well done, which makes the navigation in Wonderland very smooth though jumps (even double-jumps and triple-jumps), floating and shrinking.The story is also one of the strongest attributes of the game, being amazing. Its full of interesting characters, riddles and surprising reveals.Game performance is pretty good, I played it on a laptop and only had 4 or 5 fps drops through the game. Its locked at 30 fps, but you can easily change that in the config files.Summary:Pros: - Beautiful dark version of Wonderland- Top notch art style- Smooth and easy to use controls- Great length- Amazing storyCons: - Tedious gameplay and puzzles- Steam version does not come bundled with the original game ""America McGee's Alice""My personal score:  8.0If you love action/adventure and platform games play this gem, there arent many platform games on steam, so if you are into that genre this is a good bet. The awesome story and setting of this game will make you forget about the boring gameplay, and you will have an amazing experience for a game that gets very cheap in steam sales (I got it for 2.50 euro if I am not mistaken).

												TLDR: Game is beautiful, story is intresting and atmospheric, but gameplay streches too long and some parts will be boring and monotone - game is often on sale, a -75% usual one is GREAT to pick the game up. Don't bother with full price, I don't think it's worth it.According to Steam I've played this for the whopping amount of 36.9 hours - ingame timer says 16 hours, 91% completion.About this game: picked up a copy for a friend to return a friendly gesture and at the same time I bought it for myself, because I was really intrested in it (Alice + implementation of madness? Yes please, I'm in!)The game starts out wonderful. You'll keep making screenshots - the game world is really nicely designed and well-executed, some landscapes are jaw-dropping both in terms of quality and creativity.Platforming works great, there are no issues with controls - but after a time it can be boring, because most chapters (5 looong chapters, all in 1-2 different settings than the others) use quite the same mechanics/ideas as precious ones, only re-skinned.Combat is both lacking and feels rewarding. Why?  Personally I really miss combos and airbone attacks. Maybe I'm too new for the third-person platformers, but I think while combat plays a really central part in the gameplay, it could have been much better.  And why is it still great? You have 4 weapons - basically a light and heavy variant of melee and ranged. As most things, the weapons look astonishingly good, with real nice sound - and visual effects. But the biggest and best thing of combat system is the really different enemies. They all work in their own way - one is easy to take on with the pepper-grinder (machine gun), the other one's weakness is the heavy Hobby Horse's armor-breaking hits. Each enemy, and especially their mixed groups require different tactics to defeat them.  It's a little shame that by the time you finish a chapter, most likely you'll be bored of the enemies - the first Samurai Wasp is challenging, the third is an intresting enemy, but you'll stomp on the 8th one. Not to mention the 20th one. Level design: Gorgeous. In chapter 2? you'll go into a snowy landscape, to end up in a ship-in-a-bottle, only to get it sunk then continue your journey underwater. Another chapter is all about Japan and the East - koi pond, china-landscape, traditional fans.  Chapter 4 and 5 are just incredible and maybe the best ones from the game, both in terms of gameplay and design. If only chapter 2 and 3 would be similarly good.Though there is one thing that can put a dent on the experience: invisible walls everywhere. You can't touch most of the walls because you'll stop running ~ 30 cm before them, you can't jump on most things because pleasantly placed invisible ~2-3 metre tall ""boxes"" are placed on them because you only can jump on something you're *supposed* to jump on. It's a shame in a game from 2011.Minigames! There are various minigames/ tasks in the game you need to complete to continue: chess puzzle, sliding blocks puzzle, shoot 'em up game, sidescrolling platformer, guitar-hero like small puzzles.. I haven't expected this much variation, it's a really strong positive of the game. Collectibles: Collecting memories gives you a small quote (1-2 sentence) from a specific character of the story that deepens the main story. Even though they are quite conveniently placed and easy to find/get most of them, this makes collecting them really rewarding.  Game lacks backtracing at several points of the game, making impossible to get the stuff at the other side of the crossroads if you took the correct one  - without chapter selection. What a pity.Afterall, all I can do is to recommend this game. It has several really strong aspects, while the weakest points aren't worse than ""average"".   Previously I thought it's a silly suggestion, but *Good Guy Nick* is right - playing the game for more than an hour can induce a strong feeling if monotonicity. I feel like most chapters should be 10-20% shorter, because while there are enough action, jumping and fighting to fill the gametime, there is not that much ""soul"" in the game to keep the gamer playing for longer periods.  At the end, it was a nice - after how bad is EA's reputation in recent times, it was refreshing and pleasantly surprising to see a really creative and daring game under their name.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a solid game. Stunning and imaginative scenery, 


Alice: Madness Returns 
A Screenshot of Alice: Madness Returns
By: XJ9




spine-tingling music, good combat and platformer elements, witty, creepy, and in general fun to play. I've got a boat load of time logged on the game, granted, I believe a decent amount is on pause... >.>... but that's between you and I; However, it really is a fun game that you can lose yourself in. The boss fights are very spiffy, can be challenging (which is a bonus IMO), and the pace of the game is good. Little to no learning curve, you just hop right in and start killing things. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=250991152Combat throughout the game changes as you get new weapons, so there's a bit of variety as the game progesses. Also, get your screenshot trigger finger ready, because there's plenty of awesome stuff to snap pics of while you're playing!If you haven't, consider playing the original game as well. American McGee & Spicy Horse did a kickass job on both games, and they're both definitely worth having in your arsenal of games. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=252748888Solid 9/10. One of my faves. Just a unique game everybody should try at least once.			"

												If you want this game because you think it's a cutesy little Alice in Wonderland game, then don't buy this game. If you want it because you want to play as a crazed lunatic who battles the demons in her head in a last ditch attempt to safe herself from insanity, and recover the truth about the death of her parents, then get a move on and get it, because it is frickin' brilliant.American Mcgee's twisted art style is just perfect for this game, and whilst some people might start finding the gameplay a little tedious towards the end, I think the combat is very well done, and the world surrounding you should make you want to carry on and see what other crazy things are gonna happen. As well as the art you've got a bunch of collectibles to find, like bottles, memories and flying pig snouts. (Literally). Alice also has the ability to shrink herself, revealing platforms and passages, which is downright awesome. It's games like this that make the real world seem pointless.			"

												Since it's on sale at the moment (Steam Summer Sale 2014), I figured I'd write a quick review. Alice: Madness Returns is a solid game. Stunning and imaginative scenery, spine-tingling music, good combat and platformer elements, witty, creepy, and in general fun to play. I've got a boat load of time logged on the game, granted, I believe a decent amount is on pause... >.>... but that's between you and I; However, it really is a fun game that you can lose yourself in. The boss fights are very spiffy, can be challenging (which is a bonus IMO), and the pace of the game is good. Little to no learning curve, you just hop right in and start killing things. Combat throughout the game changes as you get new weapons, so there's a bit of variety as the game progesses. Also, get your screenshot trigger finger ready, because there's plenty of awesome stuff to snap pics of while you're playing!If you haven't, consider playing the original game as well. American McGee & Spicy Horse did a kickass job on both games, and they're both definitely worth having in your arsenal of games. Solid 9/10. One of my faves. Just a unique game everybody should try at least once.			"

												I invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time. And every creature lends themselves to change your state of mind...I finished this game about a week ago and for an old game it's pretty damn good tbh. Alice's past is pretty harsh and she dwells on it all the time thus her wonderland is falling apart.. again. And she must go into the depths of her mind to find the problem that's scratching at her sanity and execute it.I absolutely loved the scenery and artwork of this game the most. The levels were not too long but not too short either. And each chapter has so many secret rooms and hidden items. The storyline could have been a bit more compelling but it was still pretty good imo. It does have some decent plot twists. The game definitely has a pretty creepy feel to it and the enemies seem like something out of a horror movie as well. Some enemies can be very frustrating at first but once you get a good system on how to kill them then it's not so bad. The puzzles in the game were definitely a wide variety of fun, like how they should be in most games. They weren't too easy and they weren't so hard and/or confusing that it would just♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. One of my favorite aspects of the game were the weapons. Which you can also upgrade the weapons over time by collecting teeth. The characters in the game were just awesome. Ofc you have the ones you know like Mad Hatter, The Queen, Chester Cat, etc. The voice acting was spot on to the character's personalities as well and very good facial expressions.Another thing I thought was a really nice touch, was Alice's outfits. Each chapter she would change into a different dress and they would match the scenery of the current level. Also. I would eat Alice's green eyes. Even though I have green eyes myself, but... I just like her eyeballs. ಠ_ಠ The only complaint I really have about the game is that it can be a bit buggy. Sometimes when you kill an enemy it might move about like it's still kickin, but the game is just being derpy and the enemy will just disappear eventually. The only bug I had a real issue with (and others had issues on it too) was on one level, Chester Cat is suppose to appear and say something but he didn't. But it was an easy fix of just restarting the chapter again and it wasn't too far into the chapter either. But keep in mind that the game is just old.Overall, I highly recommend this game. I just didn't want to stop playing it honestly. And sometimes I find myself going back to the game and playing through a level or so. Still haven't found all the secrets and missing items though. Pros: -Amazing artwork and decent graphics for how old the game is.-The characters aren't dull-Not too easy and not too hard either. Everything in this game is pretty much a good balance-There is a lot more to do in this game than just hacking and slashing, defeating bosses/waves of enemies, and cut scenes.Cons:-Can be a little buggy at times-The story could have been a *little* more compelling			"

												Dear Alice,I find you dark and beautiful. You took me to place that I've never seen before and yet were hauntingly familiar. Introduced me to friends that I could have sworn I had met, and yet were different and twisted. Ours could have been a love affair for the ages. Now, four years after we should have met, I've followed you down the dark and twisting road of your past. I fell in love with you at first sight. You told me the horrific story of your past and for a time I sat raptured. I have so many good things to say about you. You're smart and graceful. Your movement is like a gazelle. You showed me places M.C. Escher would be proud to call his own. And yet, and yet.The truth is Alice, you don't know when to leave. I wanted to hear your story. I wanted to visit all the dark places that you promised me that we would go. I have to admit that you delivered on your promises. Each place we went was more interesting, darker, and haunting then the last. You just wouldn't leave. Every intersting thing you showed me you had to show me three or four times. As intelligent as I find you to be, your repitition was heartbreaking. The amazing thing is that your repitition was per location, not overall. As much as I wanted every time we met to be a joy, I found myself starting to resent you. I started to wish we could just finish this part and move on to the next visage that awaited. I knew that if I stuck it out, the next local, the next piece of the puzzle of your mind that you opened up to me would be amazing. It was just such a long time between one revelation and when you would open up to me again that I started to wonder if it was worth the time I was spending getting to know you. You had so many interesting insights, so many variations on how you viewed the world I wish that I could look past your refusal to grind through each and every insight multiple times. I wish, I wish, I wish. Dear, Dear Alice. You have so much to offer. Maybe it's not you, maybe its me. If another chap came up and asked me about you I would tell him how lovely you are. I would tell him how smart and charming you can be. I fear that after a few pints I would probably tell him that I just had a hard time with how long you would drag through any given situation. That the revelations were inticing, but the fluff between revelations didn't make me anticpate the revleations more, just make me resent the fluff.Love, KuasimoddoP.S. I am tentatively telling my friends you are a cool chick with the caveat that you waaaaay overstay your welcome.			"

												Fantastic game. I truly recommend it. Reminiscent of early games such as Psychonauts. Mini games resemble Little Big Planet. Dollhouse level reminds me of Saw and the Jigsaw doll. The game starts to becomes a little buggy at the Oriental stage E.g. Alice's hands no longer grasps the chain when she pulls on them.You begin to see repeats and less unique creatures. E.g. Ink Wasps are Bolterflys, Wasp Samurais move like Madcaps, Baby Doll dies to plain shooting.PROS1. Great visualsThe concept behind Wonderland is truly amazing. Looking at the floating Hatter Industries, the Insidious Ruins, the crying statue, hidden pathways that can only be seen with tiny vision and the vaiety of monsters to fight against each with their own method of killing.2. CreativityAs above.3. Combat systemAmazing. Each monster is killed in a different manner giving you the feeling of a unique creature. Unlike normal hack and slash games, you have to remember each monster's pattern of attack, else you won't be able to kill them. E.g. Insidious Ruin has to be blocked when he throws a fireball or knives, dodged when he charges and attacked from range. Eyepot has to be hit with a range attack first, followed by a melee slash. Repeat twice.I was surprised to see that this game had such an amazing combat system. I was expecting a puzzle solving game instead. The dodge and block modes with the umbrella were fantastic.The Hysteria mode will give the hack and slash fans the frenetic joy they relish if they prefer not to remember patterns of attack.4. StorylineLove the story. I'm at the beginning but I can't wait to find out more.  The story gets darker as it progresses, child sexual abuse, paedophilia, child molesters masquerading as doctors, p rostituted children hypnotised to forget and used to satisfy the perversions of wealthy London clients.Steam censors the word P-R-O-S-T-I-T-U-T-E for some funny reason. Considering the type of content that they provide. It is most strange.5. MovementLove the double jump and the quick walking speed.CONS1. MovementJumping in the air is still a bit clunky especially using the air vents. Jumping in the middle of an air boost creates some problems for long distance jumping.2. Character modelsOther than Alice, most of the beginning character models (children in the hospital) are quite boring. You can see that they are repeated multiple times.3. EA AccountI do not want to create another account just to play a game. It's irritating.SuggestionsI would love to see the combat system put into an MMORPG. Hope EA and Spicy Horse Games can continue to work together on creating quality games like Alice.			"

												If you want a gaming experience that is simply unlike any other, shell out the cash for this classic. A great mind twisting tale that delves deep into the questions of sanity and reality. Colorful, smooth, creative, and just the right length, this game is definitely up there on my list of Single Player Games. Oh, and have I mentioned, ALICE'S HAIR PHYSICS IN THIS GAME ARE AWESOME.PROTIP: You automatically get the dlc content (more dresses with powers and sweet new weapons) along with the purchase of this game, just ask me or look it up on the internet on what to do do unlock them. It has to do with changing the .ini file in the game directory. ALSO: using the same method you can make yourself invincible and godlike if you really dont want a challenge and just want to breeze through while being a badass. Ask me if you are interested!			"

IntroThe game has a very creative art style that changes throughout the game with various visuals and great atmosphere.StoryThe story is very interesting and getting the memories throughout the game to unlock more of the story itself is clever. Not only that but you are able to go back and look at the memories any time from a nice and effectively organized menu. The memories are interesting because they flesh out the personalities of the people around the main character and your understanding and roles of those individuals.GameplayThe game also offers you some rpg elements like being able to customize your equipment and upgrade what you desire. The combat itself is very fast paced, with some slow motion moments that allow you to quickly hit your dodge button to avoid attacks. ConclusionOverall the gameplay is great and fun, and so are the puzzles and challenges that become more involved the further you explore the game.			"

												American McGee has taken Gothic Steam Punk and made it into a palatable art style. Sure, you may have to spend an excessive amount of effort installing Origin and creating an EA account just to play this game but it is worth it for the brief snippets of enjoyment you'll get from this title. The platforming elemnts are tiresome yet there is a charm to the combat and after short breaks away to sate your frustration you will find yourself returning time and again to tackle the horrors through the looking glass. Not quite as enjoyable as the original, but that might just be my jaded memories of playing it 13 years ago.			"

												 just finished the game today. I have no idea where to start to be honest.Let’s say I was blown away; not only by the amazing level design, but the strong moral behind the game reaches far down in the back of your mind.This game brings the true dark-side of the story of Wonderland up. Wonderland truly lives up to their motto: “We’re all mad.”Amazing graphics, stunning level design. They weren’t lazy at ALL. Every corner, every new step reveals something new to witness. Whether it’s a teapot with eyes staring from afar or a doll hanging upside down from the ceiling and black liquid substance dripping from the orifices…The drawings on the wall, dolls, skeletons and the overall lugubrious perspective of the game.The artstyle is truly amazing.Gameplay:Not your usual buttonsmash, but a hack and slash nonetheless. But you have a heavy attack, shield, range which you can upgrade over time by collecting Teeth…pretty much anything you need. There’s a lock-on system which is pretty nifty. The jumping can be a little tricky, but overall you’ll get used to it.Whomever thought this felt very repetitive: I disagree. There are a few places in the game where you’d do the same thing, the same kind of puzzle, but they are all within a good “stop” in between.I mean to say there’s a lot of platforming in between the puzzles, a lot of other things to do before doing something you’ve done before. I think it was alright, they balanced it out pretty well.Story:I love the story, and the level designs…all the drawings, props, traps, enemies, you really feel that these are all interpretations of Alice’s feelings; something that used to make you smile is now corrupted and is  turned against you.This little review of thought MIGHT contain slight spoilers:Overall, the story, it being quite the deep moral. A girl having herself blamed for something she did not do, the grudge being pushed down her throat and the endless pain and depression ever soaring through her mind. She tries to justify herself, she isn’t sick; she’s in pain. But nobody who really reaches out for her, giving her what she really needs. All but her Wonderland friends…Although they may appear threatening, or they may appear as they want to harm Alice, they’re all merely afraid of HER.She is destroying her own beautiful mind: Wonderland. They are the creatures who roam over wonderland, and she’s her own murderer - the Infernal Train is her own invention. And if it wasn’t enough, the doctor is ever more pushing it down her mind and blaming her. If one only knew the darker intentions the doctor had in mind by letting these children forget their past…They are nothing but mere numbers. They are but the mortal bodies that walk on the earth, all forgetting their “unproductive” memories. She’s not just being tortured by herself, but others around her, who suffer the same pain, have a huge influence on her as well. 10/10 from me. It’s a damn masterpiece. "

Posted: July 20, 2015
												At it's heart, Alice: Madness Returns is a 3D platformer, with occasional action sequences that oscillate between (light) third-person shooter and brawler. Madness Returns is a diamond in the rough. It would have been so wonderful with more polish and time to add new original features here and there! I do not like brawlers nor third-person shooters, and yet I was able to enjoy the fights from Madness Returns. The first reason is that I gave a lot of thought to my key bindings so it feels as natural as possible despite the clunky design (it really requires too many inputs). The second reason is that the action is very tactical (at least in the higher difficulties, which I recommend) and has a great flow when the player masters the tools and weapons at use. For instance: Hit an enemy with the teapot canon to make it fall backwards and reveal its weak spot. Go in for a few slashes with the knife. Dash away to avoid another enemy trying to attack. Use the now reloaded teapot canon on that second enemy. Dash in to avoid the attack of the first enemy and quickly slash the downed second enemy. And so on. A ballet of butterflies and blades. New enemies here and there require different approaches, however the number of different enemy types is insufficient. Also, not enough true boss fights.Where the game really shines is in the environments. Chinese ceramics, doll houses, flesh castles, mushroom forests, steampunk factories: grandiose, beautiful, oozing with character and magnificence. The dark undertones of some locations is really fascinating, and builds a heavy atmosphere despite the childhood themes. Platforming and exploring in such locations is a treat for the eyes. Alice can go as far as to quadruple-jump and slow down her fall, and the levels accommodate in consequence with aerial elegance. The gameplay of these sections feels good, and is rather permissive (even dying by falling to oblivion is of little to no consequence thanks to an instant respawn onto a nearby platform), so progress flows well and the game feels like an adventure and not an hindrance. Exploration is well done, and some little traps and puzzles can add some spice to the platforming. Problem is, the levels are really big and long, and some sections can overstay their welcome. Well just one in particular in my opinion, the ice world. I would have rather preferred that they make the levels shorter and instead include some cool new ideas that got scrapped during development, but ok, this is just me yearning for more. The reality of game development is not as pretty as this game. Still, there are some sections here and there that are completely different than the main game and add variety, like a shoot-them-up or a 2D platformer, but they feel very floaty. Story-telling is not great, it feels quite disjointed. However the story itself is quite interesting, with lots of subtleties and darker themes. The person voicing Alice does a stellar job. Even though many people like them, I dislike the cutscenes that look like animated cardboard and would have preferred to see them done with the game engine. There are different costumes for Alice, some were part of a pre-order DLC or something. Thankfully they can be unlocked, but it is by editing the Windows Registry. Seriously, how annoying! And also if I remember correctly it is required to create/have an EA account of some sort to launch the game for the first time, thankfully not Origin or anything to install. But seriously, how annoying again... As a conclusion, Alice: Madness Returns is a game full of charm and character with grandiose levels to explore and a morbid undertone that builds a heavy atmosphere. Platforming and fighting is like a ballet once mastered, even if both will not please everyone: it can be argued that the platforming is too light and the fighting is clunky, and that both are repetitive. Alice is awesome, very elegant and pretty in all her dresses and movements, and she benefits from great voice acting.Overall Madness Returns lacks some polish and could have been better, but still very memorable and enjoyable as is.I liked this game so much that I finished it several times despite it being quite lengthy. I would only recommend it to people that are strongly attracted to its visuals and are not looking for state of the art game mechanics.			"

												This game is amazing. It's not your traditional platformer, that's for sure.Where should I start..? Probably with the best aspects of this game.The thing (that I believe) that stands out the most is the design. The game itself is like a work of art - it's a visual treat along with the interesting soundtrack and atmosphere. All the level designs are unique and they change often, keeping the player immersed and curious about the environment they are in. Sure, there are some disturbing or incredibly creepy stuff lurking around all the time, but I think that is what seals the deal. Just. Wow. I've never taken more screenshots in my life.Next would be the story. Now, I guess we don't really associate platformers with intriguing stories, but that's what makes AMR such a cohesive and linear game. As the player progresses through the story, he/she will realize why the levels are designed the way they are, why certain characters say certain things, etc. It'll all come together towards the end. Some people may think the story's a bit dramatic or just downright disturbing, but the purpose of the game is to uncover our protagonist's insanity and madness. It's GOING to be a bit provoking, at least.  But as for me, that's all the more reason to play this game.Finally the gameplay is quite smooth. Platformers need smooth controls, and I've played the first parts of this game using my keyboard, but then switched to controller (when I twiddled around with the menu and figured out it's compatible with one - just personal preference). For both methods, I think it runs fairly smooth. I've encountered a couple of problems with some levels where I had to calm down and then retry getting accross somewhere, but that just might be my technical ability to cope with the difficulties of some platformers. The only issue I really have is that camera control is relatively important in fights, but focus mode totally disregards that.  The puzzles are also pretty fun, and there are different minigames scattered here and there. It's refreshing...In conclusion I totally recommend this game. Maybe I should warn some people to not play this at night, but really, it's awesome!			"

												EA forces you to activate the game through their servers. Each attempt to activate the product key meets with the message ""System error, try again later."" Classic example of EA's DRM hurting the people who legitimately bought the game. If you want to play the game, pirate it. You'll avoid the hellhole of DRM and you won't support EA and their back-asswards business practices. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.Edit: I have since been able to play the game by downloading a crack for the game. Still, I shouldn't have had to crack a game I legally purchased. Again, the only thing DRM accomplished is to hurt the person who legitimately bought the game.			"

												A beautiful, creepy and surprisingly uplifting reimagination of a classic fairy tail as an unhinged girl's struggle with madness, abuse, guilt and probably puberty. Travelling between the bleak streets ov Victorian London and vivid dreamscapes of Wonderland, Alice battles imaginary nightmares and very real villains to fix her broken mind and her broken life. While as an action-adventure it is nothing special, and 3d-platforming sequences are boring and frustrating, it takes the player for an amazing journey of visions -- something that Tim Burton's version of Alice promised, but never delivered. Bittersweet, gruesome and fascinating, this game is something unique, something that every gamer should treat themself to.			"

												One of my favourite games of all time.This game is so under-rated and its honestly one of the best EA games.Beautiful graphics, beautiful scenery, great music, fun gameplay and intriguing story.The story is creepy.. but a really creative way to tell the story about Alice in Wonderland.This game is worth buying, that's all I can say. I've already bought it on 3 different platforms and replayed it so many times.Beautiful game 10/10 in all aspects <3 "

												Loving this game very much. Gameplay is fun. Soundtrack is amazing. Art concept is creepy and awesome indeed. There is one thing I don't like that you have to log in via EA account.This game ruins my childhood fantasy and replaces it with something better.เมื่อก่อนเล่นเถื่อนก็สนุก ตอนนี้เล่นของแท้ก็ยังสนุกเหมือนเดิมครับ			"

												Difficulty: Just RightThe Bottom Line: All it's Cracked Up To Be/Superb Score: 9.0Note: This Game Been Tried Out And Reviewed In Offline Mode or On Another Steam Account And Or Consoles.Graphics and gameplay are beautiful and fit the world wonderfully. The controls (using k/b and mouse) work well and are very responsive. Story is top notch IMO. Love the whole take on Alice and the interaction with the wonderland residents. The monsters you encounter are quite unique and do require some strategy, but they are not overly difficult at least on normalIt's not often enough that we gamers get to enjoy a twisted yet well put together story and game that is worth the money we spent on it. I got the complete edition which also includes the first game. Which I played long ago when it first came out. I definitely will be visiting it againHaven't finished it yet and really in no hurry to cause it's an Wonderfull game to just absorb slowly.			"

”And like a lot of dreams, there's a monster at the end of it.”A visually stunning journey into an otherwise broken mind, Alice: Madness Returns is a dark and bloody twist on the weird and wonderful world of Lewis Carroll’s classic novel. With an eerie and intense atmosphere throughout and the soundtrack reinforcing it nicely, this American adaptation is certainly a distinct shift from its source material and does not pull any punches. A morbid character study of the now adult heroine, you are thrown back into a hellish re-imagining of Wonderland, yet again corrupted by its own creator. With a similar vibe to Masochisia, (an incredibly well-made psychological horror indie that I actually wouldn’t recommend anyone play), the plot is heavily based on the symbolism of Wonderland and the slowing fragmenting parts of Alice’s mind and life. The ‘goal’, if you wish to call it that, is simple and singular: save Wonderland, and thus yourself, from oblivion.Portraying mental illness and the various (often cruel and archaic) methods of treatment in a way that’s both thematically appropriate and believable within the forms of game design is an extremely difficult task to pull off and very rarely achieved as a result. The Darkness II did it brilliantly, as did Masochisia. So though it takes a while to get going, (the final section of the game to be exact), and the painful RPG-like task grind that’s required to reach that certain point, the narrative of Alice: Madness Returns achieves a phenomenal take on a truly demented world and the inner recesses of a damaged mind. The problem here is whether or not the payoff is worth the grind.Roughly three-quarters of Alice is useless filler that pads out what could’ve been a tightly-packed masterpiece into a drawn-out and mediocre adventure game. Controls are straightforward to use but are frequently slow to respond or completely unresponsive, detracting from any possible interest one could’ve gained from the relentless platforming and puzzles. Framerate drops, texture popping and outright freezing at times is also a significant issue that plagues the game, but hey.. how about those hair physics? If McGee and the team at Spicy Horse had completely omitted the puzzles and platforming in favour of something like an intermittent walking simulator, it would’ve been to the game’s overall benefit. It was these rare sections that I actually enjoyed the most, as they were solely focused on the narrative’s progression.Combat is satisfying as hell, with some fantastic hack n’ slash, and all of the enemy types are sufficiently diverse and interesting to fight. Colour bursts out of the screen and the striking effect of the Hysteria ability in particular is reminiscent of the visual styles of Sin City and Betrayer. This really is a gorgeous game to behold; right up there with BioShock Infinite and The Witcher games.But what I certainly didn’t appreciate was the ridiculous side-scrolling and Guitar Hero-like mini-games that completely break from the rest of the game. As excruciating as the aforementioned grind, the inclusion of something so one-dimensional and cheaply made is bewildering.  This is a game that is quite clearly trying to be a work of art, not a coin-slot machine at your local arcade or pokies club. Some people might not appreciate the warping perspective of the third-person camera either; tilting sporadically and playing with depth, so beware if you easily suffer from motion sickness.  Props for the checkpoint system though, it actually places you in convenient positions upon failing, rather than back to where you were.. which you’ll certainly need when the dodge and glide abilities fail to respond. Unfortunately, the CD Key that’s (hopefully) been provided needs to be authenticated through Electronic Arts DRM, which also requires you to have an account in the first place. If you’re getting the system error message, just log into the same account via a browser or Origin and verify the code there before launching it normally through Steam again. You should be good to go. To be quite frank, I didn’t enjoy playing most of Madness Returns. Apart from the visual presentation, it was often uninteresting and demonstrated a poorly thought-out sequence of thinly-veiled grinding to pass to the next (and equally repetitive) section. Basically nothing happens for about 7-8 hours before the plot begins to truly kick in and the best the game has to offer finally appears. Until then, it’s fetch quest galore and the many joys of running errands for lazy characters. Yet Alice: Madness Returns still does the job. It’s far from perfect, but offers a decent experience that sets it apart from the rest. Thanks to an enthralling narrative that saves it from the dreaded thumbs-down, this is recommended to anyone with the patience to see past its many faults and experience a well-written and mature journey into the depths of Victorian London and the dark corners of imagination. A fantasy horror for the ages.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. Alice: Madness Returns is one I would put under the tim Burton category. It has a creepy atmosphere and is a bit twisted. The storyline is very well written. Yes, the storyline is dark and twisted, as if it was written by The Grim Brothers. Although, the story is carried out by some shocking and disturbing images in the game, there are also amazing images in the game as well. Overall, the graphics and artwork of the game are beautifully designed. This game contains a variety of different settings and characters. It is a very well designed game. I would definitely encourage people to buy this game, so everyone can experience this wonderful game.			"

												No matter how much bugs in there, I love this game. It's just great.+Visuals: Most notable thing is how beautiful this game is. Every single level is unique and unforgettable. Colorful palettes, various mobs. Very high quality, absolutely love it.+Soundwork: everything is cool here too+Gameplay: Amazing, various levels, various weapons and boss mechanics. Peppered with a note of nonsanity. Oh and a lot of puzzles.-Bugs bugs and bugs: A lot of bugs, a lot of problems doesn't matter if you have an old system or new, just the latest steam version of that game is buggy. But 99% of the bugs are fixable if you bother to spend 10 minutes on google, or just read game guides. Don't let your dreams be dreams, fix your game and go to play.-No steam cards - steam backgrounds would be totally awesome.

												I feel obligated to write a review after taking 18h 47m (according to the game itself) to complete the playthrough. (The 26 hours recorded by Steam of course includes time when the game was paused or sitting on the main menu while I had to be away from the computer.)+ PROSGreat artistic style: The game is over-the-top beautiful. Even with the game's age you'd be hard put to find many others that hit the level of pure artistry in imagining the twisted vision of Wonderland.Amazing level design: Each of the five story chapters (the sixth is only the final boss-fight and cut scenes) has a very different look and feel and are peppered with mini-games that break up the platformer main play with other kinds of puzzles. Great voice acting: The actors were simply excellent even when the material was on the thin side.+ MIDDLE GROUNDFlat story; As much as I was impressed with the voice talent and how well crafted the words were, the narrative itself was a bit ho-hum. And you get a lot of it by finding items that trigger memories (voice-overs). It's the same as finding audio-logs in BioShock but not as well executed because a lot of memories add only weak context to the story. It almost makes finding them not worth the time in some cases, but finding them is really part of the fun. Consider that BioShock Infinite takes just as long to complete on average as this game, but the Alice storyline has nowhere near the depth or detail.Combat: It's OK. You get five weapons and all have important uses. In general combat helps break up the platformer experience of finding your way through Wonderland. But there's nothing terribly bad nor satisfying about it.+ CONSToo long: As beautiful as it all is, the chapters are about 25% longer than they really need to be. This made the fifth and final story chapter drag because I simply wanted the game to be over by that point. This wouldn't have been an issue if there was more to the story driving the game play.Bugs: Clipping issues (getting stuck on a seemingly smooth path). Game locking up under heavy button-mashing requiring a reboot. Also the beginning of chapter three has horrible button lag that made it a chore to get through.Clunky mechanics: The auto-target system locks the camera on the current target making you circle around it when moving Alice. This makes it impossible to rotate the cam to see what's coming up behind you in some cases. It also was a bit wonky changing targets. You can't play the game without auto-target though because the game often forces perspective shifts that make it impossible to aim like a traditional 3rd person shooter. You just deal with it as best you can.No Steam achievements: Lots of unlockables are tracked in-game, however no one but you will ever know how many you got.Rating: 6.5/10Worth playing, just be prepared for a long haul if you intend to complete it. Replay value is very low. "

												If there ever was a competition to select the most bizarre, most grotesque video game I'm sure Alice Madness Returns would be in the top 3. Some of the art design employed by the game is simply the creepiest I have ever seen! But all this in the good sense as this is a damn fine game with jaw-dropping visuals and music that gives you the goosebumps.This is a journey through vivid and dangerous dreams - Alice's Wonderland but as opposed to the cartoon this is now a horrified, alternative version of the same where the only way to survive is for Alice to be equipped with a bloody knife and a teapot that works like a grenade launcher. I like how idyllic it all begins only to gradually get more and more corrupt and in the process Alice faces more and more dangerous creatures of the Ruin - this powerful force that tries to stop Alice. You fight throughout the game and you will do that a lot - but you will also solve puzzles and jump and also shrink so that hidden paths can be revealed for you to make progress.You will jump a lot and many will result in your falling to certain death. But once you have put enough trial-and-error the game will be grateful as it shows you the progress Alice makes - a desperate progress to find out what caused the fire that killed his family at their home.The game is pretty long and is full of hundreds of collectibles. I finished it in roughly 15 hours and got only 90% of the stuff scattered throughout Wonderland. There is a special menu called Troubled Visions in the main menu that is only unlocked if you collect every single bottle during each chapter. Pretty neat, huh? Plus, you can always try the New Game+ mode if you think ""Normal"" does not offer a real challenge for you.Buy this game and immerse yourself in this unique, nightmarish world of Wonderland!			"

												A bad port of an unique (but mediocre) game that could have been absolutely brilliant if not obviously rushed.GOOD+ Atmosphere and setting - especially if you've never played the original, coming into contact with American McGee's vision for Alice will leave a lasting impression - the series takes some of the subtle dark elements of the two original books by Lewis Caroll and churns them into a twisted, disturbing world of Wonderland - part steampunk fairy tale, part psychotic nightmare+ Visually, the game is simply stunning - aesthetics, visuals, scenery, animations and character models (Alice herself especially) are all gorgeous+ audio design is top notch as well - weapons and enemies benefit from some great sound effects, the game features a large amount of voice overs and the soundtrack itself is quite good (though not as memorable as the Chris Vrenna's masterpiece in the 1999 original)+ a number of interesting puzzles and set pieces that occasionally break up the normal playBAD- action is roughly divided into 2 sections - combat and platforming, and they're both not that much fun really. Combat is repetitive and quickly tiresome (enemies follow the same basic pattern throughout the game, weapons are limited in usefulness or creative synergy) and the platforming/exploring suffers from pacing issues, confusing environments and bad controls- the game itself is also far too long (~20h) and drawn out for it's own good - each room, enemy or set piece quickly wears out it's welcome before being used at least 3 more times within the chapter, and by the end the games feels more like a chore than leisure time. - the game world feels largely empty, bland, lifeless and depressive (even when it's not supposed to) - there's unfortunately not that much to do and see within the game- while the story has some depth and deals with some mature elements, it's delivered through a meandering mess of animated cutscenes, character dialogue and collectible in-game snippets of memories that are all ultimately too cryptic and pretentious and just don't make much sense. All of the characters speak in a random mix of rhymes, gibberish and shakespearian dialogue that not even the cast themselves seem to properly understand, judging by the delivery of their lines.- camera and controls are clunky and finicky (even while using a controller) - some moves don't register as you'd want them to, camera doesn't always do a proper job at showing you what's relevant in your situation (but at least platform deaths are quickly resolved by a minimal impact respawn, in-game)- horrible checkpoint system in place of proper saved games- invisible walls galore, things that don't work the way you'd expect them to, frequent stuttering, crashes, performance issues, game breaking bugs, you name it- how hard would it have been to port the (Xbox) Achievements into the Steam version as well, really?It hard to recommend this game solely on its gameplay merits. It's not really a good game. However, if you feel you have the patience and drive to overcome some of the major faults, Alice 2 can still be quite a memorable experience that is at least worth checking out. Think of this less as a game and more of an art project - style over substance.Also ♥♥♥♥ EA for not letting this project have the budget, time and care it required.			"

												Fantastic visuals, twisted plot, fun game play. If you liked the original American McGee's Alice, you'll love Madness Returns.Cute yet creepy environments that are beautifully detailed abound in this successor to the original. The controls are well done, but could be slightly better. Summary, if you liked the first one, you'll love this. Classic platforming at it's best.			"

												I never finished this game 5 years ago because my pc specs are crap. I just finished it on the last day of 2016 and I wished they continue with a sequel of this game. It is such a beautiful game and the story telling is very unique. The pacing is really great as it's not always the hack and slash gameplay. They have combined hack and slash gameplay, finding hidden secrets, advancing the story, as well as multiple mini games which serves to not only make the game fresh but also to perfectly match the theme of each chapter.If you didn't get it on steam before spicy horse has been dissolved, it's still on origin but it's a great loss if you didn't managed to get it on your steam library			"

												Okay, first of all, ‘Alice Madness Returns’ is too long… way too long. If they had cut out a third of the weaker content, it would have helped the game a lot. I mean it is still a fun and interesting game, which I enjoyed playing. It just gets a bit tiresome and finding the excessive amount of collectables definitely gets boring.With some changes to the ‘config’ files I got it to run at a solid 60FPS on my GTX 980. The game is very well designed for the most part and has an interesting, dark storyline. The animation style used in the 'cut scenes' is really cool and the enemy designs are great. The platforming is fun too and there are even a variety of surreal mini games spread throughout the campaign.There is also a nicely detailed ‘Main Menu’ with unlockable content and a ‘New Game +’ mode which adds replay value. To be honest though, when I had finished my first playthrough, I was done. After 23 hours of playing through the linear campaign, I had still only managed to achieve 94% completion. Like I said this game is waaaaaay too long and it ends up hurting the experience over all. I might come back and play the ‘New Game +’ mode in the future but I need a long break first.I would recommend that you play this game, it’s definitely worth your time (for the most part). It’s a unique take on the 'Alice in Wonderland' narrative, with interesting design elements and fun gameplay.			"

												I haven't seen a fairytale at it's best like this in years. I truely reccommend it, no spoilers, but it IS worth the asking price, of course I struggled figuring out the comtrols at first but I reccomend a controler, doesn't HAVE to be XBOX because I used my logictech one, controls are all in the same places, just have to figure out which is which, but you can do that by going to menu whilst in the game and picking Configuration then switch the keyboard display by hitting left or right on the controller so it goes to Controller Configuration. All and all it's the best game I've played yet. Good if you're looking for some hand-to-hand combat with the Vorpal Blade and a good storyteller.			"

												I would consider Alice: Madness Returns to be primarily a platforming game with some fighting; including some arcade and puzzle elements to a lesser extent.The environments look pretty good and give the impression of a dream world, but the path Alice takes is extremely linear.  There is no real exploration in this game and there are no large open areas; in fact, there are hidden walls which prevent you from even walking behind some objects.  The main path will occasionally branch off to a deadend that leads to collectible items.  The deadend paths must always be followed first because events are frequently triggered that will prevent you from backtracking.Aside from the teeth you collect--used to upgrade weapons--there are ""memories"" that will provide you with a short audio clip and there are also bottles.  I had to google the bottles because they don't seem to do anything when collected.  According to the wikia, if all the bottles of a chapter are collected then it unlocks a piece of concept art to view.The weapons are an interesting take on conventional weapons (i.e., a pepper grinder chaingun), but there are only 5 to choose from: a knife, chaingun, two-hand club, canon, and timed bombs which may also be manually detonated.  After 13 hours I have yet to unlock the canon.  There's also an umbrella that, while not a weapon itself, can deflect bombs back to the enemies that threw them.  I end up using the knife, the weapon you start with, the most.  It has a really satisfying sound and animation that I never seem to grow tired of.  Upgrading the weapons change their appearance and makes them do more damage, but doesn't given them any new abilities.  Ammo is unlimited, but the chaingun will overheat if you hold down the trigger for more than a few seconds.There is no manual save option, but the game does a good job with autosaving right before some difficult platforming.  If you fall to your death while platforming, you typically won't have to worry about redoing much of that again.  However, if you die during a boss fight, you will have to redo some platforming to get back to the boss area.  This has got to be one of the more frustrating aspects of the game.  You could die on the platforming section literally 2 seconds away from the boss and only have to redo that 2 seconds of platforming again.  If you die figting a boss, you won't get placed at that save point 2 seconds away.  Instead, you might have to endure 2 minutes of platforming along with cutscenes that you can, fortunately, skip.  It makes no logical sense.A mechanic I thought was kind of cool is the ""drink me"" shrinking effect which can be used at any time simply by pressing a button.  This not only shrinks Alice, but reveals invisible platforms and tips scrawled on the walls and floors that are EVERYWHERE.  I emphasize ""everywhere"" because the developers somehow thought it would be good to hold your hand and tell you where every secret path can be found, what collectibles are down that path, what enemies to find around every corner, and what weapon to use on them.  Everywhere.  These tips can't be disabled.The most annoying aspect of this game is the constant camera hijacking.  The game will frequently pan the camera to some triggered event and then return it to a predetermined angle leaving you disoriented.  Infrequently it will fix itself at a particular angle and distance for platforming and also in confined areas.The mouse control was unplayable for me when I purchased this game over a year ago.  I decided not to play it at that time because of that.  You should consider yourself forewarned if you use a mouse because you may not be able to tolerate it.  I picked the game back up recently and I've been using a 360 controller which works fine--aside from having to manually edit an .ini file because the main menu does not include the option to disable force feedback.I find the platforming and boss fights to be enjoyable and challenging and not at all frustrating; instead, the frustrating parts are bad developer decisions that could have been avoided.  While the graphics and animations are beautifully done and the story is somewhat compelling, it doesn't seem like enough incentive to continue playing.  I feel like I'm playing just to get to the destination instead of playing it to enjoy the journey.I suggest only picking up this title during a Steam sale so you don't feel too cheated when you decide to not finish it.

												I am terribly embarrassed about this review myself, as I should've written it a long time (A long time) ago. I know, it's a little late to post a review about it as it's not on Steam anymore. Well, this is mainly the purpose of why I am writing this.I can simply say that this game is outstanding, I had to play it multiple times to understand it. The graphics are amaizingly awesome, SH and EA were absolutely creative when they built this game, such as the idiom (flying pigs), they are real, in a way. What made me feel really sorry is that they have removed this game from steam. This should NOT have happened, due to the fact that it is a great game with a complex plot and a magnificent horror story behind the curtains. There are interactive characters such as the Red Queen, the Mad Hatter, and Cheshire Cat.Moreover, the combat field, the focusing, the Pepper Grinder, the Hobby Horse, the Teapot Cannon and the classic Vorpal Blade and each and every one of their upgrades are incredibly powerful. With them, wrapped aroing the Shrinking and other magical abilities, and with the changing dress at every new chapter, makes Alice herself and her wonderful Wonderland a place of mistery and purity. All in all, I heard about the new some days ago, maybe a week, and I kept playing it whenever I have time, I cannot say how sorrowful I am to know that this game, once wanted by many video game players, is now being removed/ unable to be played via Steam. If it was any way Steam could bring this title back for those who desire and have not experienced this game yet, bring it back. So, regardless this remorseful news, I would most likely recommend this game in any way you can purchase it.			"

IntroductionI bought this game on sale for $5 and it sat in my library for a couple weeks. After starting to play it, however, it quickly found a spot on my favorite games list. Even though some parts were tedious, the story kept me engaged untill the very end.Prepare yourselves for an exceedingly long wall of text (go to the TL:DR if you wish to skip).


HowTo: Unlock FPS ; more FPS [ENG|GER] 
A Guide for Alice: Madness Returns
By: Dein schlimmster Alpentraum

			In this tutorial i am going to show you how to unlock the FPS in Alice: Madness Returns :) Please leave a comment and usually your favourite when it helps for you Last edit: 28.03.14		


OverviewAlice: Madness Returns is a psychological horror game developed by Spicy Horse and published by Electronic Arts in 2011 for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is the sequel to America Mcghee’s Alice, made in 2000.Before I ramble on about everything that I enjoyed about this game, I would like to point out a few flaws with this version on steam.First: the umbrella to block projectiles might not work (it didn’t for me) and if so, you will have to change some files to get it to work right. Next: the combat focus mechanic is far from perfect and has many flaws. It feels awkward to use at first and could use some polishing. Love it or hate it, this mechanic is essential for fighting certain monsters. I got used to it eventually, but it was hard starting out (because you have to hold down the CAPSLOCK key to stay focused).You will also need an EA account for a brief activation (as far as I can remember) but then you don’t need it for the rest of the game.Now on to things I enjoy about Alice: Madness returns:Varied environments: from dark castles, underwater cities, Victorian London, an asylum, and even a train. All of these settings make for an interesting experience as you travel throughout Alice’s now twisted version of wonderland.Platforming: Satisfying and well designed (albeit repetitive) embodied by unique jumping mechanics (I will explain later). Something that would make the platforming better would be to include the edge grabbing mechanic originally shown in America Mcghee’s Alice.Story: I won’t spoil it for you but here is a brief summary: Alice tries to piece together memories of the night that her family died in a fire and ultimately finds out who is truly behind her madness… The story is presented in an interesting way, mostly told by cut scenes, brief dialogue and memory shards that are hidden throughout the levels. The story is very thought-provoking and I recommend that you go into the game as blind as possible because of how captivating the story is, especially towards the very end.Challenge rooms, puzzles, and game modes: There are several puzzles in environment, needing to be solved to more on (they can also be skipped). They vary from playing musical notes, finding blocks that need to be arranged to form a picture, and chess. I enjoyed most of them, but the finding the blocks for a picture is repeated around 6 times, which got repetitive. There are also multiple challenge rooms where the goal is to survive waves of enemies or complete a certain objective. When a challenge is completed, you are rewarded with some red paint. Each time you collect this paint, a part of a rose is filled in. Once you fill in a rose 4 times, you gain an extra rose container (like a heart). Lastly, there are a few game modes, each unique to its environment. An underwater side scrolling shooter, 2D platformer, and baby head rolling course (which is by far the most bizarre of them all).Weapons: There are 4 of them, not including the clock work bomb which you will collect as you progress through the story. In order of appearance they are: Vorpal Blade, Pepper Grinder, Hobby Horse, and Teapot Cannon. (there is also an additional variant for each of these included in the unlockable DLC). The Vorpal blade is your first weapon and used for fast melee slashing. Next, The Pepper Grinder is used rapid, medium to long range assault (and for triggering switches). The Hobby Horse is a slow but powerful short range weapon that is effective against groups of enemies (and is my favorite). The last weapon you get is the Teapot Cannon, is long ranged weapon of high damage and large radius (can be used to break some walls).Character customization: There are several outfits for Alice, her original outfit that changes depending on which environment you are in, a few others, and the DLC outfits. The DLC outfits and weapons each have buffs (or debuffs) that can fit your playstyle. Also, the Teeth you collect can be used to upgrade your base weapons, changing their look and empowering them.Mechanics: many of them stood out to me, aside from the combat focus. Shrinking: used to get through small keyholes and reveal hidden paths. Activated by holding down left control.Health system represented by roses. You can regenerate health by picking up roses that enemies drop or finding a purple flower (if you shrink on top of a purple flower, it will regenerate your health). You can increase your health capacity by completing challenge rooms.Hysteria (my favorite) where Alice taps into her insanity for several seconds to become invincible and gain increased damage. This can only be activated at extremely low health by pressing enter.Jumping: you can jump 3(?) times in midair, losing height with each consecutive jump. If you jump and hold down space in midair, you will slowly float. Also, while we are talking about movement, you can dodge by pressing left shift.Enemies: Small leech-like slimes to massively destructive blobs with baby faces and flamethrowers. Nuff said. Each monster has their own attack pattern and vulnerabilities, which you will need to recognize in order to be victorious. The enemies vary from environment to environment.Level design: predominantly linear with multitudes of secret memories, bottles, and challenge rooms to be found. A few puzzles (mentioned above) are included, but the vast majority of each level relies on platforming. This may get repetitive, but this is up to personal opinion. Although there are no steam achievements (wish there were), you progress is recorded and you can see how many secrets you have found (no one but you can see).Graphics/art style: Surprisingly stunning, detailed environments. One of the selling points for me. I was constantly taking screenshots and have 350 of them (200 uploaded). Half the time playing I was looking for the perfect place to take a screenshot (I got some pretty good ones).Performance: Mouse sensitivity takes getting used to, controls are clunky at first, but after playing for an hour or so, you’ll get used to it. The FPS and a few other things can be changed by editing some game files. You can find guides on how to do this if you look on the Community Hub.Free DLC: Although it is not enabled by default, you can enable the DLC (that includes outfits and weapons) for free by changing the value of GIsSpecialPCEdition from FALSE to TRUE. Due to how much I liked this game, I decided to check out the earlier game, America Mcghee’s Alice. For a game made in 2000, it really impressed me. If you want to play Alice: Madness returns or have enjoyed playing it I strongly recommend you get a copy of America Mcghee’s Alice. It even has slightly better controls (sensitivity wise). TL:DRTo summarize: Alice: Madness Returns features a unique atmosphere, impressive soundtrack (which I forgot to mention), surreal story, decent platforming, weapon appearance customization, interesting mechanics, linear level designs, vibrant and dark art style, and average performance. On sale this is a must buy and at $20 I would still recommend it (if you understand some of the flaws).For personal enjoyment I’m giving it a 9/10 and for review purposes, I give it a 8.5/10 because of its flaws. Just be prepared to troubleshoot any potential problems that could arise.			"

												How is it humanly possible to make serenic views, tea parties, and undersea villages horrifying? American McGee found a way, and it is terrifying as it is beautiful. Even knowing how it would end (a friend spoiled it for me -_-) and without playing American McGee's Alice first, it was still fun and it kept suprising me.Pros:-Beautiful graphics-Amazing voice acting-The story (it's original and different compared to the other interpretations of Alice in Wonderland).-The soundtrack -The dresses are beautiful and after completing the game the dresses get buffs or debuffs (to give you a harder challenge)-Puzzles weren't too difficult-The graphics-You experience Wonderland and Reality, which is interesting to add to the story-Interesting weapons and mechanics-Did I mention the graphics?Cons:-Had to do a bit of modding to get it to work-Had to follow a guide and download extra files to get American McGee's Alice (but it works well)-Control support wasn't included but I found a program online that allowed me to use it-Keyboard controls were unresponsive at times-EA forced the developers to rush it out so it could've had more content (Damn it EA)-No trading cards, achievements, emoticons, or backgrounds for your Steam profile -Can be repetitive-Ran into a few bugs but nothing game breakingOverall, this game is as beautiful as it is haunting.

												It's like Tim Burton and Lewis Carroll had a baby. Err...with that disturbing remark aside...The story really leaves a mark on you, and the visuals are gorgeous and well-thought out...like an amazing dream world. The atmosphere is alluring at some points of the story, yet gets more disturbing and haunting in some areas. This is a game that must go to your horror collection, whether you understand the base story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" or not.			"

												Alice: Madness ReturnsGame DetailsPublished by: Electronic ArtsDeveloped by: Spicy HorseGenre: Action/AdventureRelease Date: 17 Jun, 2011Completionist Gameplay: 22 Hours“Alice Liddell, believing herself responsible for a fire that consumed her home and her family, escapes into a twisted version of Wonderland. While held at Rutledge Asylum for treatment, Alice was able to conquer her doubts, and eventually was released from the ward. Alice, now 19 years old, resides at an orphanage in Victorian London, under the care of Doctor Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist who uses hypnotism to help his child patients forget their memories. Though she believes herself cured of her madness, Alice still suffers from hallucinations of Wonderland..""The GameplayAlice: Madness Returns is an action platformer that presents itself with a creepy, dark and creative atmosphere. Wonderland is inhabited by squirming leaches, firebreathing dolls and evil looking teacups, creating a twisted and surreal vibe. As you float and jump through an eerie dollhouse, you can drop bombs, shrink down to a miniscule size or dodge ceiling spikes ready to slam down on you. Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn’t evolve much from the start. This causes the game to become quite repetitive, especially when often, your task is to go and fetch something for another character. If it were not for the distinct and peculiar backgrounds, you might be tricked into thinking you’ve been playing the same level since the start. However, throughout the game there are plenty of hidden secrets motivating the player to fully explore every grotesque nook and cranny. There are enough hidden secrets to make it worth inspecting Madness Returns' grotesque nooks.Alice:Madness Returns does try to change the gameplay up. There are ramps to slide on, an underwater combat scene, puzzles to solve, and a giant dolls head to control. Unfortunately, oftentimes the camera gets in the way of doing these things. There are awkward transitions going in and out of third person, and side views are generally useless. Instead of a heart-pounding flee from a giant executioner, it feels like Alice is just jogging towards the camera. You’ll certainly be glad of the change of tempo, but it leaves a lot to be desired.Melee is the best part of the combat system in Alice:Madness Returns. It feels light, fast, and incredibly deadly. My favourite melee weapon would have to be the Vorpal Blade. Alice will flutter in and around her enemies, slashing them to bits and leaving a trail of butterflies behind. Unfortunately, ranged combat isn’t as fun. The controls for ranged combat lock your camera in place and the targeting system is a little frustrating to use. Unfortunately, this makes many of the battles you will face in this game almost impossible, especially when you are facing multiple enemies.The SoundtrackThe soundtrack in Alice: Madness Returns is spot on in setting the mood. The voice acting is good. Nothing spectacular, nothing terrible, as it can get a little repetitive, especially during the longer levels.The ExperienceIf you buy the DLC, there are some stunning dresses you can wear throughout the game. The Fleshmaiden is a direct example of this. While wearing this, Alice’s pupils are white, her legs are bloodstained and the actual dress itself is a mesh of bloody flesh and tendons. The story of this game will be left in your mind for weeks after you’ve played it. It is engaging and a dark twist on your childhood memory of Alice in Wonderland, and you’ll probably never be able to read it the same way again.Overall VerdictWhile the gameplay can be a little repetitive, I honestly think this game is worth it for the dark, realistic take on a fairytale.If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!

												So after comepleting this game, I found out it`s a sequel to another Alice game. Wow I think I missed out on something here.Presentation: Right of the bat, we see that the game is split into to ""stages"". stage one is the real world, where Alice is lossing her memories, and tryes to find out how her familie got killed. The secound stage is wonderland, where Alice turns into a badass and kills the monsters of wonderland. The story is based around the Alice in wonderland universe, but the universe here is far more disturbing, and shows a more grim side of wonderland. I think I would apriciate  the tone more if I had played the first game, but as long as you know  Alice in wonderland. It dose not feel like you are missing out on anything.If you don't know about the Alice universe beforehand, I would say you would find this game really random at times, since no charecters wouldn't make any sense to you. Gameplay/Controles:In terms of gameplay, this game is acually very fun. It can get repetetive now and again but the balance between combat  puzzels and platforming makes the game seem more or less fresh all the time. In terms of main gameplay, there is your 3D platforming and your combat. In terms of platforming, the game can from time to time fell a bit slipery, but after you get use to it, you fly around the levels. The platforming is also mixed with puzzeling, where you have to activate a switch, and afterwards run back through some tricky jumps. This can be frusterating at times, but when you succed you feel great.The combat is simple, you aim with the mouse and leed Alice towards an enemy. You will get other weapons than your standard knife, like a heavy weapon, and a light and heavy gun. This makes it up to you, to find out how you want to take care of your enemies all the time, and it`s a great way to make palyers chose what they want too do, and what battle type they prefer. One thing though which I`ll also mention in visuels. I had problems with the game, and it started to prefomre purely when to many enemies where on the screen, this runied the gamepley a bit for me, but it is a matter to be overlooked, if you have a strong PC.The enemies are all themed from the stage you are on. There are teapot fighters from the Mad Hatter stage and card soldiers from the queen of hearts stage. You need to find all the enemies weakneses in order to win, and some of them, needs a bit more of stragetie to defeat. There are also fun ministages, such as a sidescrole shooters, a maze game, and much more. There is also a lot of collectebels to find in this game. Which only makes you want to explore the beutifull world even more.Charecters:If you know your Alice in wonderland, you`ll know most of the charecters. All of them have been givin a more sinister look and perseronality, which is also reflected by the stages. You`ll meet many great charecters such as the Mad Hatter, the Carpenter and the Queen of hearts. All the charecters are well voiceacted, and have there own persenalitty, and it is a joyride all the way through.Visuels:As said sometimes the game slowed down for me, but it dose not change the great looks of this game. Every single stage is beutifull in it`s own way, and everything is so well done, that I think the visuels where some of the most importent things of this game. Evey stage has it`s own charm and it`s own looks, there is a steampunk stage based on the Mad Hatters tea factory, there is a Water level that looks beutifull, there is a japanese inspired level, a cardhouse in the sky and much more, everything looks so beutifull and nice, that you want to explore everything, and see even the smaller details in this game.  Music:the music is very well made, and fits in with all the stages. Not much to be said here, other than I want the soundtrack so I can play it for a D&D night. Story:The story is accually not that complecated , Alice needs to find her memories in wonderland, and also find the out how her famelie died in the real world. The game switches from wonderland to real world, and you find out new things all the time. Alice needs to face many of her old friends in wonderland, and the progress you make all the time, makes the games story flow by pretty smothly. I am not going to spoil anything, but let me tell you, the end boss is a blast to fight.Conclution:This game is really good, with great charecters, fantastic visuels, and nice music, but tihs is maybe also the minor complain I have. The gameplay could at times be a bit better, and the art direction seems to have taken over with this game. This is not a bad thing, but if you are a gamer, that don`t care about visuels, this game can seem a bit flat at times.			"

												A beautiful 3D platformer (Don't rush through the levels, particularly the prologue and first level, stop and look around) that takes place after the events of American McGee's Alice. Alice, now older, returns to a corrupted wonderland to do battle with events from her childhood and her own insanity. EA initially market this game as a psychological horror game. While it certainly is creepy and dark at times I would never call it scary. This game has more in common with games like Spiro and Banjo Kazooie than it does with your stereotypical psychological horror title.The game is a lot of fun, both combat and platforming are incredibly satisfying (Having the ability to triple jump and glide from the beginning and LEARNING to master these abilities as opposed to unlocking them). Each area of the game grants access to new weapons, allows you to collect teeth (currency) to upgrade your weapons and gives Alice a new outfit whcih is a reflection of the level (a nice little touch). The game also contains 'memories' and other such collectables which allow you to unlock bonus content (concept art for example) which will appease the OCD side of the avid completionist.The game does suffer from some optimisation issues (It's a console port) and certainly does control better with a gamepad. If you are considering giving this game some serious playtime I would really recommend getting access to a controller. After a while the game does start to feel stretched out, few new mechanics and concepts are introduced and it turns into a slight grind to the end.Overall, I think this is definately worth buying and playing. If you are still making up your mind, check out this Let's play by Just A Friend and Sinatrapod from the lparchive:http://lparchive.org/Alice-Madness-Returns/Happy gaming.			"

												i love this game so much.I was so interested in this game when it first came out, I completed the whole story mode within a week. I thought the art/setting of the game was beautiful, and the gameplay was great as well. This is definitely a story that I will replay over and over, the concept of finding Alice's memories is too sweet.I also really liked the ""Chapters"" concept, where each chapter would have a different mood attributed to it, with Alice Liddel in a different coloured dress. There were some puzzles in this game, but they were at the right difficulty - I didn't require a guide at all during this game and I found it lots of fun. Please treat yourself and buy this game. (I even own it on Origin, too)			"

												Bought this game on steam when it first came out and enjoyed it, despite some technical problems with the game. Reinstalled it this week to play it again and discovered that the third-party DRM is no longer working and the game can't be activated anymore. Despite a valid EA account and a valid CD-Key provided by steam, all activation attempts result in a very unhelpful ""system error"" message. I was finally able to activate the game through a series of methods discovered by searching extensively online for people with similar problems. All in all I spent about 3 hours simply attempting to launch the game - this is absolutely unacceptable. I notice that the game is still present on steam but can no longer be purchased. Perhaps Valve has halted sales because they know this game doesn't actually work? Or perhaps EA stopped new sales to focus on their competing platform. Either way, something needs to be done. Ideally valve would pull this game entirely and issue full refunds to all who purchased it, at EA's expense. I paid $60 for the perpetual right to play this game, and that contract has been broken. tl;dr: This game is approximately 3 hours long and takes place mostly in search engines, abandoned forum threads, and notepad. Not recommended.			"

												Not as good as the first but okay.Same sexy brunette Alice, same demented world from the mind of American McGee. Better than the movies by Tim Burton.Very strange game, kinda repetitive but yet fascinating because Alice is so mentally disturbed. So it is the psyche questioning that saves the game really.It's good enough.			"

												Отличная игра, стоит того что-бы её купить.Но понравится она не всем: кому, тем что игра сильно затянута, в плане геймплея. Кому своей безумной атмосферой.В ней можно отдохнуть от шутеров и наслодится атмосферой безумия: попрыгать по странным, а порой и не видемым платформам, и поубивать странных, а порой и страшных врагов.Но единственное что огорчило именно меня это то, что теперь надо учить Английский язык или качать русификатор титров и меню, поскольку стимовская версия полностью на Английском языке.К тому-же, если будет, с удовольствием поиграю в продолжение этого ""безумного"" шедевра.

												Fantastic and brilliant game. I never considered myself a fan of Alice in Wonderland, but now I do. You see, it's not just about a girl who goes down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. American Mcgee, creator of this version of Alice, showed me just how awesome this mytho can be if you interpret it in different ways. In this particular version, which quickly became my favorite, Alice is a delusional girl who lost her family in a fire, and spent most of her life locked in an asylum. Wonderland is nothing but a fruit of her (twisted) imagination, and a way to escape the tragedy of the real world. This is a sequel to American Mcgee Alice, released in 2000.  Pros   Incredible world inspired by the original Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but ultimately created by American Mcgee. Enjoy a beautiful, varied, twisted and dark version of the original place Alice has such a passion for. Characters also get the American Mcgee treatment and fit perfectly in this new world. Prepare to bond with poor Alice, who is victim of her own mind, and start to root for her as you play and meet new characters. Sooo much variety in Wonderland. Everything is just gorgeous to look at, holding a lot of style and originality. Alice is such a good character in this version that I think she deserves her own point in this list. Alice is a beautiful young girl, and you will start to care for her the more you explore her tragic past. As always, emotional affection in games just proves how high quality the product is. Dresses. Yes, dresses. Alice will get a new dress with each new place you explore in Wonderland, and they just keep getting cooler and cooler. Plot. Just amazing. Seriously. The more you play, the more you want to know about what's going on. Story pacing is just superb. Weapons. While there's not a lot of them, they will certainly keep you entertained. The Vorpal Blade and the Pepper Grinder are your initial weapons, but you'll get a few, more intereresting options ahead in the game. They are all very stylish and creative. I guarantee you've never seen anything like it. Interesting upgrade system. You'll be collecting teeth throughout your journey, which you can use to upgrade your weapons. This not only will make them stronger, but also change their appearance. Great combat system. Not only is this a platformer game, the action in it is awesome, and the combination of both things is something no other game has done. While not perfect, the combat system can be mastered, and soon you'll be kicking some Corruption♥♥♥♥♥ You can slash, bash, shoot, dodge, block, reflect, target, or throw a bomb to divert enemies from you. Great platformer. Madness Returns also stand out as a platformer, not leaving anything on the table when it comes to great 3d jumping and twirling. Enemy variety. No combat can be good without good enemies, and Alice: Madness Returns delivers. All enemies are fun to fight, and trust me, there are a lot of them. Enemy quality. Doesn't matter if you have dozens of enemies in your game and they all suck. Here, not only are enemies fun to fight (as I mentioned above), they are styled according to the place you're currently at in Wonderland. It's just awesome to enter a new place and try to imagine how the enemies will be, according to the current scenario. Hair. Alice's hair in this game is really a thing. While clearly not perfect, it works really, really well. The wind effect is just beautifuly created. Good boss fights. Bosses are just as good as regular enemies. Gameplay variety. You simply can't get bored when playing this game. There are at least 5 different gameplays in here, and most of them are great (see: Cons). Gameplay time. This game is really long (especially for a platformer), all while maintaining a great pace. It will surely keep you entertained for many hours. Great amount of collectibles that are actually fun to look for. Voice acting is top notch. Soundtrack. Oh, my. Just remembering that main menu theme gives me goosebumps. Graphics. While not the best (keep in mind this a 2011 game), they deliver. Holding up greatly to this day, they are supported by the outstanding art. Optimization. Very optimized game. And I don't mean ""I can max it in my gtx 970"" kind of optimized. I mean ""I can run it in my celeron, gt 620 combo with decent graphic options"" optimized. All cutscenes are skippable (useful when you're replaying the game). You don't need to play the first game to get into this one.   Cons   There are a few short segments (4 or 5, I think), where the game turns into a 2d platformer. Those parts are atrocious. Boring and sometimes unfair and glitchy. 30 fps cap (can easily be fixed). Negative mouse acceleration (no way to deactivate it). You can have a few problems if you remmap the keyboard keys, such as actions not happening, even though you are pressing the correct button (yes, I'm talking about that damn umbrella tutorial). A lot of people manage to get past it, and others don't. I had a little bit of trouble, but I got lucky and it worked. If all fails, I'm sure plugging a controller is a 100% reliable method. "

												The design, feel and visual uniqueness of this game is hard to describe.

Really.I love it, I love the game mechanics, the design, and for what it matters there's also a storyline, but I scarcely care about it because whoever drove the main gist of this game is someone so well in touch with their own nocturnal affairs that simply walking through the maps is an oddly, bizarrely enjoyable experience.The only downside is the sluggish response and non-optimized engine.  Ever had that hard-to-nail feeling that ""there's something wrong here.. like I'm walking in shoes with sticky soles, or trying to drive a car with a slightly loose steering wheel and laggy servo mechanism"" ?  That's the feel I get in Skyrim too, the feeling of something made for a console (and in my world, game consoles are an entertaining, but utterly inferior species) ported to PC without optimizing.  'cause feck the PC gamers, right? They'll just buy new hardware, right?It's from 2011, this is 2015 and I think a dual core 2.8Ghz with a Radeon 290X ought to be enough to run these graphics smoothly, with no input lag.  Alas, not the case.Don't let the above deter you, I'm fairly confident these are somewhat card/driver-specific, and it's not actually a problem unless I max the physics (which I don't really notice anyway).  Just take heed if you're someone who's bothered by these things.Imagination, visuals, gameplay, cool mechanics and a unique atmosphere, it's a fantastic game, totally recommended.  Beautiful.			"

												I am torn on this game, on the one hand the Gothic and peculiar style of the game is amazing, and provides a nice dark twist on the classic story. The graphics are very good for its age and most of the time, the combat feels great. However, every level feels the same as each other, with just a different skin dashed over the same mechanics, the same platforming, the same monotonous puzzles and honestly this is where the game completely lost me. The story is barely there, the game feels drawn out purely for the sake of stretching playtime as it adds nothing to the story and when you've killed 1000 black baby blobs, you've killed them all and it starts to become a chore more than actual fun. It also doesn't help that the game, on a technical level is objectively♥♥♥♥♥♥ The performance is dire when compared to any other game from 2011, the numerous glitches forcing me to kill myself in order to restart the section because some how a giant monster is walking on air and it won't die, the slight jolt in game rendering as it places ""moving objects"" at the incorrect moment just adds to how frustrating this game is and ultimately killed it for me.See, that is the worst thing about it, if you would have given me this repetitive but stylish game in a better engine, I would have been happy and would have more than likely completed it, but as it is, it's a repetitive, annoying, broken slug fest and that is a damn shame.

 The short answer is that this game is a work of art. It's a paradigm of how other works can be adapted into new and great ideas. I think it's also the last ""Art"" that EA ever published.First, the good: The graphics are gorgeous for its time. It may have been made in 2011, but it could easily pass for 2014-2015. The problem that I find with most of today's action-adventure platformer titles is that they feel short. Madness Returns, however, is a meaty adventure. It's filled with all kinds of secrets, nooks and crannies to explore, and pig noses to shoot. The environments of each chapter are varied and detailed, right down the very clothes that Alice wears. The story is interesting in its own right, although I'll admit, there were points in it where I got a bit lost. The characters are all good adaptations of the ones from the original book. They still follow similar roles, just in a darker way. The combat is a decent challenge, although it can get a bit easy once you fully upgrade the Hobby Horse. The thing I like about it is how the battles are well placed, with a good amount of time set between encounters. The enemies are also diverse, although there are some instances of re-use (i.e. Boltorfly and Ink Wasp doing basically the same thing). The platforming segments of the gameplay are executed nicely. It felt like the levels had been designed with care, rather than just spitting random moving platforms and ledges everywhere.Now, get ready for the bad: You know how I said earlier that this was a meaty adventure? That can be a double-edged sword. Yes, it has a lot of level to play, but sometimes the levels drag on. This game was tagged as being a horror game, but I wasn't scared for most of it. It didn't spook me until the last chapter, and maybe once in the second. The one consolation here is that Madness Returns doesen't rely on cheap tactics like jump scares when it tries to scare you. The things that spooked me were actually kind of nightmarish. "

												Alright so, you found out about this game, came here looking for directions, wanting to know if it's worth your hard earned money, and is currently reading this review. Unfortunately, as you probably noticed, this game is not on sale anymore on Steam (but you can still buy it from another popular digital distribution platform).Which is a REAL shame.Why is it a ""REAL"" shame?Let me start by saying that this game is a masterpiece, graphically speaking. Its enviroment design is gorgeous, each chapter has its own feeling to it, its own story, its own enemies (which are decently diversed), I can say without a doubt that this is the most beautiful game I've ever played in my life, period. I'm not one for art, I never really cared about art in general but this game made me actually stop whatever I was doing to enjoy the scenery, enjoy each and every single detail in it. To sum up, this game is breathtaking. For real. The focus the developers put into making every moment unique is already worth the buy....Wait, what exactly IS Alice: Madness Returns?Let's get something out of the way first: it isn't a horror game. It certainly has some horror elements to it, but you won't be constantly scared of what's going to happen. It's more of an adventure-platform game. You'll be jumping and stabbing creatures like crazy, though. It's a fun game, I'll tell you that!Beautiful that, gorgeous this, but what about the gameplay?The gameplay is not the best, but it's good nonetheless! The controls are pretty tight, you can feel that you have total control over Alice, and if you fail trying to do something, it's all on you buddy. You'll be double even triple jumping during most of the game, so you better practice your timing and coordination.This is vital to explore the world. The main plot is uncovered by simply just going from a chapter to another, but the sub-plot is revealed by discovering memories hidden all around the level, so you have to be paying attention to everything and be willing to do some crazy tricks to find them all.But you'll probably spend some time familiarizing yourself with the controls when battling, since they are kinda confusing and frustrating sometimes, but mostly at the beginning when you're still learning how to focus on an enemy while trying to evade multiple attacks, among other things.Since we are talking about the combat, I'll let you know that this is also not a hack'n'slash game. Yeah, you'll be gutting creatures like it's f****** christmas, but the game will force you to strategize your attacks, since each enemy has its own weakness, and you can't kill them all using the very same technique, even more when there's a bunch of them attacking you at the same time.So, the game is beautiful and the gameplay is decent. But what about the story?""Alice: Madness Returns"", as you probably already know, is the sequel to ""American McGee's Alice"", released in 2000, but I wouldn't say it makes much of a difference to play the first game before this one. Since Alice is just revisiting Wonderland after 10 years, the only things you'll be missing out are how this one character ended up this way and why some places are like this, apart from that there's no major event that you should be aware of that'll actually prevent you from fully comprehending what's going on in this game.And, boy, what ISN'T going on in this game. I won't talk about the actual plot since that is vaguely explained in the game's description for a good reason, but I can guarantee you that I enjoyed every part of the story. The game's premise is pretty interesting and it does a very well job in making you theorize about if Alice is actually in Wonderland or not, and if you really are paying attention to everything that's happening, you start ""losing"" your mind. The story hits a point where  even you, the player, the only mentally stable person so far, starts to question what's real or not, and that, my friends, is what really got me hooked up in story.Alright, alright, but a game is nothing without a good soundtrack!This is not an issue either. If you really care about music in videogames, then I must say that you're in for a superb ride! The soundtrack, totally orchestral, composed by Jason Tai and Marshall Crutcher, is absolutely phenomenal. Each track captures the moment you're at, more ""aggressive"" tracks will play while on combat, more relaxing tracks will play while trying to solve a puzzle or while exploring the game in general, and some tracks will even make you stop and just... Think.Alice: Madness Returns has one of the best gaming soundtracks, in my opinion.Come on... This game can't be perfect! Tell me some bad stuff about it too!You're right! Nothing is perfect, so here we go:  It's too repetitive. Alright, I understand, you can't go many different ways with a platform type of game, you'll have to jump and jump and jump again to reach that item, that's not my real issue with it, but they actually re-use the same puzzle at least two times in a chapter, and when you're reaching the end of the story and all you want to know is how it's going to end, they actually get reaally annoying. There's a straight path ahead, but you can't cross it because you HAVE to finish this simple-yet-frustrating puzzle. Besides, some mini-games are just plain boring.  It's buggy. It became a routine during my gameplay to get stuck in the ground after a cutscene or ""just because"". Or sometimes after a battle the game wouldn't let me progress because it kept waiting for me to finish off all the enemies, even though all of them were dead already. This is the worst type of bug, but didn't happen often, at least.  It crashes ocasionally. During my first playthrough, which took me 17 hours, the game crashed at least 4 times. It isn't much, and maybe it won't happen to you, but a crash is a crash, so be aware of that.I'm still not sure if I should buy it!Alice: Madness Returns is not a game for everyone. If you like to play all kinds of games, if you want to watch a good story unfold in front of you or if you like platform mixed with adventure and some action, then I would highly recommend it. You won't regret any single minute of it, assuming you'll look past the game's flaws and focus on the bigger picture (which isn't hard to do).But, if you're here because you thought this game would be all about that psychological terror or some hardcore hack'n'slash, then you'll be disappointed.I shared with you my thoughts about the game, so now it's up to you to decide for yourself. As you can probably see, I loved this game. Maybe you'll love it too!			"

												I don't think there could have possibly been a better sequel to American McGee's Alice. It's darkly gorgeous and creative with brilliant level design and simplified combat driven by a dark, psychological story. That said, the boss fights were underwhelming to me, especially the final one (Just start the game on Hard or Nightmare), but all my complaints are minor. In contrast with the first game, there are few memorable music pieces, as there's much more focus on background ambience, though the addition of heart-pumping fight music is nice. Still a bit disappointing considering it's Chris Vrenna. Anyway, there are plenty of moments where I got stuck not knowing where to go - another leftover from the original, but this sequel really succeeds where it counts.There's simply much more plot going on here, more characters and a mystery to unfold - all fueled by solid voice acting. There are some loose ends still untied once it's all over and I did feel some of the symbolism - especially with the end villain - was forced, but considering the dark creativity at display with the monsters and levels, I can easily forgive that. Seriously, the amount of detail put into places you won't even necessarily visit is amazing. Anyway, if you enjoyed the original game, absolutely play this - and vice versa. I didn't even like Madness Returns at first, but it won me over for all the above reasons.			"

												Do you like third person platformers?  You'll like this game.  You are born into the world with not only the ability to double jump, but you can quad-jump, and you can glide after each jump!  Platformers dream come true.The imagery in the game is beautiful and twisted.  Some scenes are wonderfully gorgeous, while other scenes are ruthlessly violent.  I'm not really a screenshots kinda person, but I did end up taking a lot of screenshots of this game.  And the hair physics...you wouldn't think something so small as which way Alice's hair blows in the wind would be such a big deal but it is surprisingly pleasant to watch during those moments when I stop to smell the roses.The platforming complexity is decent.  Hardcore types might be turned off because the path forward is relatively linear and the puzzles themselves are relatively straightforward, but it's still a satisfying experience.  Especially because this game has not frustrated me even once, which is surprisingly difficult for games in this genre.The fighting isn't incredibly complex and the moveset is fairly limited, but it does give you four different weapons, fast melee, strong melee, fast ranged, strong ranged.  Some attacks work better than others against some enemies.  The fighting adds a nice break between platforming segments; I don't grumble when a fight starts, but I don't get all excited either.For the completionist, there are lots of little things to look for that are hidden away.  I'm usually pretty thorough at searching for things and I've managed to miss two or three things in each level (out of about 30-40).  Fortunately, the game allows you to replay previous chapters you've beaten, so you can get a perfect score.			"

ENG: Score 11 ouf of 10! The worst fears a kid can have is from the people he thought were good, if they do bad stuff to him it's just hundred times more hurting. And if this kid is emotionally sensible, the pain can be multiplied by his perception, as you can see the aesthetic beauty from Wonderlands, before its falls. It happens that these crazy things just made a super fun and never old fighting mechanic, with some creative and dynamic gameplay. Better yet, American Mcgee and his team rightfully leaves EA as Bioware should have done a long time ago. Impressive.But the last thing you hear before descending to the Wonderlands is ''I need a drink'' from a over caricatured granny, from some over caricatured, 18th smoky world who is curiously leaving Alice's beauty untouched. Curiously her psychologist isn't charicatured neither. You're just on the ugly fourth dimension looking at a third dimension caricature, mirroring your world's real beauty. Clever.Little silly spoiler ahead I never saw such line so perfectly timed with an event in a game's plot. Already expecting the worse, Alice's mind immediately triggers the Wonderlands, but gradually warping the place into a hell hole makes you think. What is exactly that is happening, assuming this is but an dream? ""It's just a game'' claims the skeptics, but the undertones on the dark music will never let you forget to theorize things like beating or touching. Water falls made out of tears are sad enough, but hot grease/tea eruptions? Shocking.Thoughts, not spoiler On my opinion, whatever is happening, Alice is obviously far away from being a hero. I don't like her so forced voice acting, but she's anti-hero by all rights and means. And even if a darker plot is taking place she isn't saving anything, sometimes not even her own self. In the other half you feel this ''I don't care'' trying to erupt somewhere. That's a common child abuse collateral. No worries, this is just another subtle message from the writer, we live on a society that bad plus rebellion equals to hell. Like literally assuming she-demon powers, like in the first version? Intriguing.Post Traumatic Disorder victims treatments often relies on remembrances, you do that the whole game but the memories seems to be all but fragmentated, shattering the little reality there is and you just can't trust the Cat. (best voice acting in the whole game) Curiously, he seems to be the salvation. The granny is drinking to get higher, Alice's drinking to get smaller. Step on a violet plant with arms pushing her down, it closes but you don't lose any health. Sad.My interpretation This is truly an sophisticated psychological triller of the most saddest and subtle meaning I ever came to play and because of that, I'm always fully depressed during and after my gameplay. (the game is great for delivering it so precisely and subtly) I don't have control over my character, I don't know what is happening to her real ''her'' in the third dimension that is, leaving lots of room for interpretation. It makes me feel that I'm just helping the character to get even more lost instead of saving her, and this is absolutelly depressing. Devs went after some psychologist or pedagogue on the matter, Alice is definitelly being molested on her outter self... But as the game has a non-realistic approach on the theme, it is obvious that some darker forces are taking advantage of her unfortunate condition. So you will find a lot of possible fantasy themes in there and not all of them are on the third dimension... see? If the dark music is cool, so it's when on action, making the game looking even weirder (positively). Outstanding.To avoid any massive spoiler, I'll finish it. Sick/saddest/awkward game I ever played, which wages an perpetual war between subliminal conceptualisations and a nice third person gameplay. Go for it, but please, this isn't a children oriented game. Speaking of which, always be smart and gentle with children and teenagers... that's what the message is all about. Optimistic?			"

												The artwork in this game is really awesome, I love the scenery and the whole style of the game in general. It can go from a bright beautiful setting with an upbeat tune and nature sounds, to a dark twisted scene with eerie music and a cold feel, in matters of seconds. Which I think nicely reflects the ups and downs of emotion the main character Alice is going through while she’s trying to fight her insanity.Even though it’s a sequel, it’s not as if you need to have played the first one to get this one, it’s a unique game and I like the collectables you find along the way to give you just that little bit more background information on the characters.The voice acting is amusing,the game is enticing,the combat is easyand the plot is pretty decent.In general, a really good game, I definitely recommend it to anyone that thinks they might be interested in it, but isn’t all that sure.

												This is a good game, not one you enjoy a lot but still worth playing, it's fun. This game is about Alice Liddell, and the corrupted Wonderland, through the story you will find facts to remember what happened to exactly her family 10 years ago, why her house burned, if it was just an accidental issue or it was done purposely, Alice will remember more and more things thought the game about her past. Also art style of this game and story are creepy. People say girls like this game a lot even if they don't play a lot of videogames, so maybe.I liked a lot of things from on this game like in every new chapter she gets a new dress, her hair is also very good done(it's not like TressFX in Tomb Raider, but not far from it), you have an interesting weapons that you find by progressing the game you can also upgrade them, graphically game looks good with a lot of beautiful zones, there are a lot of secrets, story is also good.Things I disliked, game sometimes freezes for 1 sec(happens to a lot of ppl, maybe is caused because of PhysX, because I have them disabled with my AMD card), while fighting some buttons are just next to each other so this makes you sometimes pressing the wrong one(but I guess you can change them to another key if you like), sometimes game becomes boring if you play a lot in one day.I would give it 7/10.

												This game has so much wonderful potential, but falls flat on it's face because of extremely poor key-press design, glitchy game-play, and show-stopping bugs that EA in their wisdom decided not to fix. I was only part the way through the game before I was hit with the dreaded umbrella fail glitch, and was unable to proceed beyond that point. The assorted fixes on the internet didn't work. Having said that, provided that you don't attempt to change the key-presses, then the game is playable with the odd lag, and you may find the superbly imaginative graphics are irresistible.			"

												Alice Madness Returns is a great, well put together, 3rd person action game. First of all, you can clearly see from screenshots and videos that this game is a great looking one, sometimes even breathtaking. The game is divided into 6 chapters and each chapter has its own unique look and they all look great and I think the developers did a really good job in creating a Wonderland that is shaped out by Alice herself. Along with the corrupted Alice mind and the corrupted Wonderland the creatures that once lived there also became corrupted and even though I found the enemies to be really well designed at first, they quickly get repeated over and over throughout the entirety of the game but they still provide solid and enjoyable combat scenarios.Alice Madness Returns tells you the story of how Alice thinks she's responsible for the fire that burned down her house and also killed her parents and sister. She gets the help of a doctor from an asylum which tries to make her forget about what happened and that it wasn't her fault. By thinking that she was responsible for the death of her family, her mind becomes corrupted, and so the Wonderland, and this is where the game takes place. Throughout the game you'll visit various regions of the Wonderland which have become corrupted and each one them has been designed in a very unique way.Alice Madness Returns is pretty much a straight up linear third person action game with alot of platforming segments, puzzles, minigames and alikes. The game rewards exploration by giving you extra health and teeth, which you can use to upgrade your weapons (knife, hammer, pepper gun and tea cannon), not only you get small benefits by exploring but you'll also be able to collect ""memories"". Memories are audio logs that when picked up they will trigger a memory of someone you know on the real world, this, in my opinion, makes the storyline progression not that linear in the way that if you don't explore and don't collect all the memories you probably won't get certain parts and you won't understand the game that well. The gameplay is pretty simple, you walk/run, you can jump, glide while in the air and jump multiple times while in the air, this is the key, along with great timing, to solve alot of ""jumping puzzles"" that are scattered throughout the entire game. I mentioned above that there are also some kind of puzzles and mini games, the two examples I can think of right now is some kind of minigame which plays pretty much like Super Monkey Ball and another one is chess, except that in this chess you have a maximum number of moves that you need to use in order to move two pieces of the chessboard to a certain location by moving them at the same time (pressing right will make one piece go to your right and the other piece move to your left, inverted chess if you can call it that way).Besides what I already mentioned I think nothing else needs to be told about this great video game. Absolutely gorgeous environments and music, well designed and breathtaking scenarios, surprisingly good and interesting storyline and characters along with the solid and satisfying hack and slash combat are reason more than enough for me to recommend this game and for you to pick it up.

												Another game with a very good story but its a bit too stretch over a rather repetitive and not that challenging gameplay. Its obvious that this game was designed for controller so u will experience minor issues (especially camera) when playing with keyboard&mouse.On overall i would give this game 7.5/10Many thanks again to kind soul who gifted me this game via SG - GunsOfDeath!

												Alice Madness Returns is possibly my favourite game of all time. It's a beautiful game, with cleaver puzzles, lock-based hack'n'slash combat.The audio is very well done, with excellent ambient music and scores. You play as Alice Liddle, exploring the memories of your past to find who set her house on fire, killing the entire family.You can shrink to fit in tight spots, and see things that you normally wouldn't see.Triple jump, with a very nice floury effect, floating to those; hard-to-reach areas.Dashing out of the way is nicely done, turn into a flutter of butterflies then reappear out of harms way.The environments were stunning, gorgeous and serene, contrasting to the dark and ominous. Cut-scenes are fantastic, very well animated. (Love the art style)It's a memorable experience; a game you'll never forget.The minigames are enjoyable and well designed.Had puzzles that once completed I thought ""damn, that was pretty cool."" so I loaded an earlier checkpoint to replay the puzzle.Makes me sad that the first game (American Mcgee's Alice) isn't on sale anywhere. Not even on origin. Controls take some time yo get used to. (if playing keyboard) but it's still playable.Collecting teeth will let you upgrade your weapons to make more powerful versions. Each has it's unique use.Bugs:I have had several issues with enemies/minibosses being invincible, thus prevent progress. (Mostly in CH5: The Dollhouse) Restarting from last checkpoint/restarting game fixed it, but it got rather annoying. * There are a few tweeks you should do in the config file before playing, ie; Removing the 30fps cap, unlocking the dlc...)(Check player guides)* Required a one-time activation on Origin. Origin does not have to be open to play this.10/10 Must Try.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns.(What is it?)This game is a twisted take on Alice's wonderland, often macabre and dark,  sometimes just gloomy, this game touches on topics like denial, insanity, murder and molestation, and the story is probably the darkest i've ever seen in a video game.  The story has a TON of twists and plot holes, though i wont spoil it, if you have any triggers about♥♥♥♥♥♥ insanity, denial, murder and so on; do NOT buy this game.Best storyline i've seen in a LONG time 9.5/10(Is the gameplay good?)In MY opinion, no, i do not like the platforming, and the combat is very flawed. The level design sometimes suprises me, but it's often just generic platforming with very little inspiration. I can tell that this game took inspiration from psychonauts and the previous alice game, however. it fails miserabely to emulate the charm and wit of those games. As quoting the children in the orphanage ""Mad as a hatter, without the charm"" I will not lie, the game has allot of suprises when it comes to gameplay, and dependant on what kind of gamer you are, these changes can make or break you. I did however feel a huge rush of adrenaline when in hysteria mode.Decent-ish combat, but sub-par level design. 6.4(I do not mean the graphics and visual stlye.)(How does the game look?)Put Psychonauts in a blender, add some denial and a few doll heads, and some rabbit blood to boot. There's your game. In all seriousness though, the game looks amazing. The visual styles often remind you of how you're inside alice's broken mind. Graphical quality could be better, the post-processing is ugly, and the game doesnt run as well as it should.Amazing visual styles, but i bet this game would run on the original xbox. 8.8(So is this game right for me?)If you're like me, you like a deep and dark storyline over amazing gameplay. The gameplay in this is not to my tastes, but the story is just perfect. I recommend playing the previous Alice, however, first. As I like a deep/dark story line WITH amazing gameplay, I'd play Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix over this any day, but this is so much darker.If you liked the walking dead and psychonauts, yes, this game is right for you.(Replay value?)Nothing for me, i doubt i'll go anywhere near the game now that i've completed it.No score for this yet.SUMMARY:8.5 The game is great, though very flawed, the story makes up for the lack of innovative level design, and  shabby combat. If you're just in it for the combat, don't get it. If you want a story that will be in your mind forever, It's well worth whatever you pay.Small update: Haven't played for about a year now, and I have no desire to.			"

												Alice... Alice... Alice... I have to say i was very skeptical about getting this game, seeing that im not as big on Alice in wonderland than a lot of mainstream society. I jumped into it and found it to be a very smooth game with devilish humor and dark suggestive intents. This game fits me perfectly as for my studies in college and career wise. It plays on psychological themes in Alice's mind. Her memories, and within those memories a very dark and gritty atmosphere. I have only just started this game and i feel i definitely got my money's worth and i plan on continuing this game. The graphics in this game.. although they're not amazing, they're clear, dark themed and her hair... my god, every strand of hair she has moves with her. They did quite amazing on the physics. This game not only captures a dark mind of a schizophrenic Alice, but involves a dark world with kind of a scary, horrific tendency to keep you compelled to keep playing. The combat is actually fun, i actually really enjoyed it and it's difference on crouching and dodging. It involves her teleporting into butterflies and shifting around the enemies. The combat so far uses a knife that can upgrade. it's actually quite fitting for the type of game it is. So i leave you with this, i recommend this game through and through and i'm not even done the story yet. When i do finish the story i will probably update this review even more but i just feel with this game it's too good to pass up. I just wish i had played the first one so i could understand everything. Enjoy this game.			"

												This game revisits the fantastic and equally unique, Quake-Engine built, American McGee's Alice, and went under the radar as a rough diamond at the time of release mostly because of its rushed release schedule, and in part because of how different it was. It's a relic of a better time in that it uses good old golden-era game design elements, like introducing you to new enemies every so often, teaching you how to use abilities and combat techniques, and then testing your skills with bosses and platforming sections. Some players will find frustration in these forced hold-backs and see them as restrictions, others will love the less forgiving gameplay.HighlightsExploring the world and discovering the, albeit thin, story and character history while passing through some stunning visuals is a real blast. I couldn't stop taking screenshots from start to finish and most of what makes this game so much damn fun to dig through comes from the diverse but always distinct and visually compelling art style.* Interesting, worthwhile collectibles and extras which add to the replay value. For example, unlocking new dresses gives you different abilities.* Some of the best visual elements and art styles of any game ever made, despite the now aging graphics and texture resolution.* Lots of interesting new gameplay elements as you progress and weapon design of a somewhat different calibre.* Old school Apply-What-You've-Learned boss battles and progresion.MistakesDevelopment for this title was rushed out by EA and it suffered as a result. Despite a number of small issues in different areas, it's a striking and alluring solidly built piece of awesome gaming which lets you to forgive its few mistakes.* Invisible walls, when coupled with the, at times, unpredictable controls can cause frustration and take away from the gameplay.* Mildly repetitive combat and lack of weapon variety despite the very interesting weapon designs are an oversight.* There are annoying bugs and a general lack of polish in some areas, and some underlying technical issues.RecommendationsAlice clocks in at an incredibly satisfying 13-15 hours of play time and even has lots replayability for completionists. It's fairly priced, currently at £14.99/9.99€/$19.99 it's cheapest by far from Europe. It goes on sale at -75% at least once per year on Steam, usually during the big sales and is well worth buying then.* Like most EA games, Alice: Madness Returns includes a free CD Key which can be redeemed on your Origin account/client. To activate, right click Alice in your library menu and select View CD Key, then simply redeem that key from inside Origin as you would any other game.* The DLC is included on Steam for free. It's hidden, but takes 60 seconds to activate. [Instructions to unlock the DLC are available here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121133044)* While fine with a keyboard, Alice handles better with a controller.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game. My initial reaction was that it handles horribly, but once you actually get past the real world and into Wonderland the game really opens up and allows for excellent platforming and combat. The pinned down and awkwardly restricted feel of being in the real world serves to highlight how liberating going to Wonderland is for Alice, even if it has been overrun by horrible monsters. The story is dark and quite cleverly written, which really helps to drive the whole game along and keep you wanting to find out more (as if exploring the scenery and cutting up creepy slime-oozing dolls wasn't enough to keep you moving through Wonderland). Collecting memories as you explore your damaged mind helps to slowly reveal the entirety of the story in all its ugliness. Definitely worth a play; I would have to list this amongst my very favourite games such as Psychonauts and Second Sight. 10 out of 10, would psychoanalyse.			"

I am just 2 hours into it but I am sure there is a big chance of it taking more than the average completion time just because of the artwork.Mixing what you already know of a happy and colourful world with creepy and dark elements makes it more enjoyable. Don't forget the nice music.Game controls took me a little at first to get used to but I think such a game is much more playable using a controller. "

												Alice: Madness Returns is possibly the first game to make me wish that reviews had a third option: a shrug. A ""meh"". A non commital ""eh, it's alright.""Well, that went ahead and summed up my review. To explain, I need to emphasize that this game is in no way a bad game. It simply has too much going for it to be a bad game. The art style, something many agree upon in their reviews, is tremendous. Each scenic area is more beautiful, more mystifying, more creative, and more surreal than the last. The combat is visceral and feels great. Indeed, it is very responsive and very smooth. When you're not pitted against enemies, you're platforming, and the controls in a platformer need to be of a very high quality lest the player get upset that they're fighting the controls and camera. Alice: MR succeeds at this and provides more than enough options for the player to overcome any and all obstacles and jumps to be done.This sounds really positive, but honestly, these are the only positive things Alice: MR deserves, as it simply fails at so many other things. While the combat feels great, it gets incredibly repititive and boring, never really rising above any sort of difficulty. In fact, I died two times in the entire game, and felt challenged only in one of those two fights. Every single other encounter had me quickly dispatching the enemy and moving on, never really feeling like I was overcoming anything. On the other hand, the platforming feels great, but due to the fact that Alice gets three jumps as well as a long distance float, levels end up being stretched to large scales, creating a sense of emptiness. Indeed, while the levels look very pretty, they are also nearly completely lifeless and hollow.But you know what's worse than the levels being as lifeless and hollow as they are? The fact that they go on FOREVER. Seriously. Alice: MR should not have been longer than a five hour game in all honesty, but it took me fourteen hours of what I would describe as ""slogging"" through the game in hopes of finding a conclusion to the madness. The various chapters will pack a punch in the beginning but will ultimately fail to keep you interested not even before you get 1/6th of the way through a chapter. You'll be forced to perform some ridiculous pace breaking puzzle like solving a shifting cube puzzle or playing chess instead of simple progression, and believe me when I say that you will end up just skipping all of the minigames after a certain threshold of tolerance. Before every level there is a segment where Alice wanders through her city in a non combative, explorative manner, and honestly, this is the best part of the game. This is where all of the (very minimal) story is, and once it's over, you realize you're going to have to slog through 3-4 hours of repetitive gameplay before you get to have more story. And that's weird, right? Wanting the gameplay in a video game to be over with so you can enjoy the non gameplay parts. Guess that's just the sort of Madness in Alice: Madness Returns.I think the biggest problem stems from the fact that there is no hub world like, say, Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie, Instead of getting a variety of small but interesting levels with lots to do, you are forced onto a ""train"" of endless repetitiveness and linearity. Imagine if Super Mario Sunshine had no Delfino Plaza but, instead, you simply moved from one level to the next, and instead of these levels being detailed and full of stuff to do, they were stretched out into a blank, empty shell of its former self. Actually, I guess that kind of sounds like New Super Mario Land. Huh.So, do I recommend Alice: MR? Yes, but with a huge caveat: it's entertaining, but only in the shortest bursts. Attempting to play for too long will drive you... quite mad.			"

												     I absolutly LOVE this game. I'm a huge Alice in Wonderland fan as it is so this was pretty amazing! I came across some pretty bad bugs which I know most people that have this game on Steam do experience.      This is one of my most favorite games but EA really didn't give any patches for the many glitches in this game. I couldn't use my umbrella or do anything what so ever (other than walk) when I was big Alice. I searched the internet everywhere and I tried everything that people have suggested. But nothing worked. It started to look like I wasn't going to be able to go any further into this game because I kept running into problems that seemed impossible to over come.     How I got around EVERY GLITCH I CAME ACROSS, I plugged in a controller! For some reason the computer keys would never work (no matter how many times I changed or reset them). Try using a controller for the parts you can't get past. It was the only thing that worked for me!Hope this helped!			"

One of the very few games where I've been awe-struck by the environments and spent time just to walk around and admire the scenes from different angles.While the fighting elements can't be described as innovative, they should be fun enough not get in the way of finishing the game — they're definitely pretty enough.

												Charming, twisted and beautiful; a 3D platformer set in a darkened, nightmare dreamscape of the Wonderland mythos. Aside from the theme, what sets Alice: Madness Returns apart from other 3D platformers? The answer here would be, without a doubt, the environments. The platforming itself isn't taxing, it's simply the mode through which we traverse the obscenely pretty level design; whether it be the Victorian, smokey and claustrophobic city; the pristine fantasy of Wonderland, contrasted very quickly with a horror-packed perverted version of; a dirty, mechanical Hatter's domain; or an underwater grotto. What of the gameplay? The platforming is fun, and whilst not difficult, it's not dull either, and is often spiced up with some combat - which, with a controller, feels fairly robust, isn't overwhelming and offers a satisfying break from platforming. The story, in collusion with the environments, delves into the sick mind of our mad Alice, spiralling downwards with a half-memory of burning her home, and in the process, killing her family. As is often hinted at, Alice is duelling with real-life turmoil manifesting itself through her fallen-from-grace Wonderland, and therein lies the key element of the game, the pivotal relationship between her unreconciled conscious and unconscious.  All in all, Alice: Madness Returns feels cohesive and well put together. The gameplay is solid, but the real reason to play is the journey you'll take.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I went in with not much of an idea what the game was, but I expected a dark themed Wonderland with some Wonderland themed enemies, weird looking scenarios, and maybe something more of a horror story. Sadly, that wasn't what I got.What is the game? Imagine God of War, with less fighting, more awkward floaty jumped platforming and stuff to collect that you might not even know what it does, and no boss fights even though it teases you like there's going to be one, but then cancels it, plus a very weird narrative that you are supposed to care for.Do I recommend it? Well, no, not if you're expecting greatness from this game. If you're on for a mediocre game that in terms of gameplay puts nothing new on the table, and has a story that might get more interesting and twisted and psychological towards the end (which I personally still hope it does, as I have yet to see anything like that), then sure, go for it.To mark my point it might just be better to list what I liked and what I didn't. Just keep in mind that these are my opinions and that I have yet to complete the game, and these are the points I already feel are faulty for the enjoyment of this game. Let's start with the dislikes:· The camera acceleration is too fast and feels wonky, as in unstable. When in first person view though it becomes too slow.· Weapon upgrades that just upgrade the weapon and give it a new look, what new features it has beside that? Who knows, more damage? Maybe, didn't feel like much though after upgrading the knife twice.· Enemies. The common enemy is a petrol blob with a baby doll face and some tubes on it's back. Then there's a giant version of it with more faces and doll arms. A floating version also exists and who knows what else. Not the most interesting enemies to see. Each zone seems to have 2-3 extra monsters in it, which is still underwhelming to be honest. Industry zone has a nice looking mechanical tea pot, which fits the theme of the Mad Hatter, flying screws that come from a metal nest, not the fanciest of designs, and some goblins with cutlery and cups as helmets, which are fine. Water zone has walking Angler fish and crabs with a cannon arm and a cigar to light it, yay?· The combat lock camera and parry. You want to fight multiple enemies at once and parry? Then you shall only lock onto one and THEN be able to use the parry, and while locked, not know what comes from behind as you can't really move the camera and are constantly facing the enemy.· No boss fights. The thing I hoped would happen after so many repetitive fights, but no, there are no boss fights, which might have been even a good idea, cause who knows how they might have turned out.· Bugs. Most noticeable during a 2D ship segment, which is supposed to be able to fire, yet none of the commands worked, not even in a secret room which had a harder version of that segment. Sometimes a line is said just before another characted finished his. Some say there are more, I haven't found them yet, thank god.· The jumps are way too floaty and combined with the weird camera you'll probably miss a lot of jumps, specially since most of the game seems to be floating platforms.· The soundtrack (if I dare call it so). I read praise for it, yet when I play the game, all I can hear is a 5 tune loop that becomes very repetitive, obnoxious and boring. It makes the platforming even less entertaining. It just feels slow.· Alice's voice acting. For a character that at the start of the game narrates that she's traumatized and her Wonderland is broken and twisted, as the imagery suggests, she sounds pretty uninterested when she actually lands there. She sounds the same in all the conversations I've heard her speak yet. The other characters at least put some emotion or charisma in it, whereas Alice probably could see her house go on fire (again) and say ""Oh, well that isn't pleasant at all, what a shame, better move along"".· The graphic designs of the levels. I've seen 3 areas, and I only liked the first one, as it was Wonderland, it was nature mixed with weird elements like domino pieces, statues, the potion that lets you shrink, the colors. It was nice to look at indeed. The other two areas, well.. The second is an industry level, which, oh joy, mostly greyish and brown colors, like in all the other games, though admitedly, some rooms where alright when mixed with the lava fountains. Third area, water levels (without the physics), cause everyone loves them, specially when it's all dark, the wall decoration doesn't stick out much, and once again, there isn't much to look at. And yes, I said I expected a dark themed Wonderland, but then again, what part of this is it? And if you make the platforming boring, at least make the visuals more fancy.· The narrative. The point that should get you hooked, but kinda fails to do so, at least for me. Care as this part might contain a bit of spoilers until the 3rd area, which is where i'm currently at. It starts with you telling your Doc your trauma in the real world, which is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you might expect and that's perfectly fine. Then you're sent off to get some medicine, on the way you encounter people with weird rabbit faces (which would have been nice enemies, but I have yet to see them), which turn out to be illusions which disappear after an old lady talks to you. Till this point, I found it pretty good. Then you are on a rooftop with the old lady, some dialogue happens, she gets a weird rabbit head, the floor breaks and you fall into neverland. I suppose that it despicts your mind while you fainted in real life. What I don't get is how after the 1st and 2nd area, you go back to the real life world, and have her wake up at a port, there's not too much that explains it, and once again Alice does not sound concerned at all. Meanwhile in Wonderland, the part that you play more actively, you ""have"" to collect your memories, which are very loose sentences someone spoke, either your doctor, or your therapist, or family. I say ""have"" because it seems to be more of an optional task, as you can miss them, simply ignore to collect them, and some are even hidden (though not too much either because the game tells you everything about the level). So, while there are cutscenes after long whiles and completing an area, which talk about Alice's past, these memories do so as well, yet not really in a satisfactional way. I remember one saying something alike ""Some insects eat their young, Alice. They have much to teach us, alive or dead."", which only made me question what the hell that had to do with my house burning down.I really don't know if I'm missing something because I haven't played the first Alice game, but this one feels just weird.Things that I liked:· Alice's character design and change of dress when in a different area.. The idea of a twisted Wonderland.. The characters you encoutner and their voice acting.			"

												Bought this game then proceeded to spend three quarters of my waking hours over the next few days spelunking through the depths of Alice's insanity, the girl's got issues, to say the least. And after that dose of crazy, I've been having funky dreams, too. Been a while since a game drew me in this much. Consider this TL;DR.Now onwards, to the good, the bad, and the ugly.THE GOOD:The aesthetics. The scenery is really satisfying and pretty, even when obviously bad things are happening. It changes slowly, sometimes subtly, but you can't help but notice how broken Alice's mind is once you scratch the surface. And the journey is going to be long, indeed. Things will get worse before they get better. Also Alice's dresses, they're lovely and fit the theme of whichever part of her mind she's currently in. Complete mood whiplash when you swap into the monochrome-with-red Hysteria mode that's one of the best visual depictions of psychotic episodes I've ever seen.The combat. It flows nicely, and all enemies have their weak and strong spots. A few occasions will pit you against a formidable challenge, and split-second decisions will need to be made to survive. The weapons are imaginative and you can switch between them seamlessly, and Alice isn't shy about using them. The variety of enemies is decent, and all of them represent some mental problem Alice is dealing with. You also get a last stand mechanic, once you're down to your last rose, you can enter Hysteria mode (or ""Psycho Mode"" as I like to call it) which renders you invincible and increases damage for a short while (while looking awesomely morbid and badass), and if you gather more health while under effect, you can chan it if you drop to a single rose again. Don't get too reliant on it, though, later on many enemies can do enough damage to not even let you have the chance to use it.The sounds. From Alice's voice acting that does wonders for relaying her personality and Cheshire Cat cryptic snarking, to the ambient sounds and the soundtrack itself, you won't even notice most of it because it flows so seamlessly into the setting and just becomes part of the whole experience. The subtle puns. ""Train of thought"", ""Jumping off the slippery slope"" and ""Shattered mind"" are quire real in the Wonderland, to say the least.The ending. It leaves things open to interpretations, of which I have at least three competing ones at the moment, ranging from mildly optimistic to downright depressing, and none of them is more likely than any other. It's that kind of game.THE BAD:The lack of bosses, especially since it's obvious they were planned, but only one made it to release. Why did that happen? Well, likely budget or deadline problems, and considering who published the game, that doesn't surprise me. There are some tough, mini-boss like enemies, but they can't both present challenges at significant points of the game, AND not get a little repetitive as the time goes by.The game feels shorter than it could have been. There's more to explore, Alice's mental issues run deep indeed, and at times I felt as if things were unraveling too fast, some characters aren't explored as deeply as they could have been. With the cast, content and concept, this game could have been made considerably longer, however...The platforming sections sometimes feel too long, and start screaming ""filler"" at you. Especially in the first and fifth chapter, there were extended times when I felt I wasn't actually doing anything, nor getting any closer to the underlying mental taint while I spent long periods of time getting from point A to point B. The platforming puzzles themselves are okay, but sometimes too concentrated.The focus mode. While combat is good, this is one aspect that simply doesn't work. The focus mode only really works one-on-one since it forces you into wonky camera angles, so aside from the scene not looking as gracefully badass as it couls, the beasties trying to eat your brain from directions other than twelve o' clock are going to become a real problem. This mode is reduced to something you use to deal with the strong enemies once you've dispatched the trash mooks through normal (and impressive-looking!) combat. A shame, really, because it has much potential for blocking and ranged combat.The occasional glitches. The only one I really ran into occasionally was invisible ankle-high-walls in the middle of nowhere that I got stuck on and had to jump over which cost me just enough time to have to restart the jumping puzzle, but people also report crashing and the like.THE UGLY:The truth. Not going to spoil, but bloody hell, the truth is ugly.Several enemy types. If you think being insane could be kind of cool, remember that you really don't want these abominations traipsing through your skull. Sanity is not overrated.Everyone except Alice. Honestly, pretty much everyone except the protagonist looks like they just crawled out of the gutter. Whether it's just her perception of everyone is up to interpretation. I'd say that it likely is, especially considering who the only other relatively normal-looking character is.THE BOTTOM LINE:If you like platformers, atmospheric horror, and disturbing, morbid content, this is a game for you if you're willing to forgive its flaws and the fact that it requires EA authentication (but not an Origin account, oddly enough). Oh, and this game definitely isn't something you want to let your kids play in the evening.			"

I Re-downloaded the game on Origin, and the game wouldn't launch. I've owned this game for 4 months now, and I havent been able to play it once, due to so many glitches.I have re-installed, I have spoken to tech support, I have set compatibility modes, ran as admin.. Nothing works.I do not recommend purchasing this game. Simple as that. "

												Alice: The Madness returns is a game where the enjoyment of the gameplay and narrative may stand apart from eachother.Let's start with the part that  ends up failing: Its platforming.There is a distinction to be made between not challenging and boring or tedious. In this game's case, it is the latter when speaking of it's platforming element, the practise of jumping across platforms to reach your destination.While the difficulty of the jumping puzzles does raise slightly, it rarely introduces new elements or methods of thinking that help you pass future puzzles. The gimmick remains simple. Jump platforms until you can no more, shrink yourself to see secret platforms or keyholes, and flick switches and shoot targets to progress further. The implementation of the latter two eventually ends up to be slightly confusing in the last chapter, but not excessively so.This simply is a case of a gaming element that is it's weakest part, while being omnipresent. If the platforming wasn´t basically the only method of transportation throughout the game, it could´ve been forgiveable. But right now it becomes a question of whether the game can be redeemed by it's strengths.One thing that surely is not one of it's strengths is the combat. A lot of interest from this games comes from people having played the original American McGee's Alice. There, the platforming was somewhat reduced and combat took a much higher priority.In Alice: Madness Returns, combat takes a little bit of a backseat. The grand array of weaponry has been replaced with your faithful old knife, a pepper grinder for a quick firing ranged weapon, a Hobby Horse as your heavy attack and a Teapot as a heavy bombardment firearm. Each of these are unlocked throughout the game, and do tend to play a part in progressing the platforming. But not in a Metroidvania style, of course. There's no level backtracking, which is good because that only helps one of the games strengths stand out: The design.If there is one thing that the game developers did spot on, it was level design. In many levels, you feel like things have been hand placed. Every area feels unique, and are beautiful in their own respect. Seldom have I felt as enticed to just stop and look at the areas that I pass, as I have with this game. While I will not say that there have been some less interesting corridors, they are far and few between. All in all, the world does not just imply madness, it genuinely invites the player to believe that they are in a world of fantasy, where they can safely forget the rules of reality. And a play on reality this game really is, at least when going by it's story...The story of Alice: Madness Returns is not the best I've ever experienced. In the end, it did not make me think deeply or differently about the things that I already knew in life. But it follows three storylines and beautifully merges them together at the right time. These storylines are mainly Alice in reality, dealing with events around her as she tries to manage menial tasks ; her investigation of why her 'Wonderland' is slowly falling to ruin ; and her placing pieces together of her past, the burning of her home and family that left her in this state to begin with. These three branches meet in the end and reveal the final plot, which wasn't very surprising, but very well orchestrated nonetheless.Alice: Madness Returns is not very good as a game. But as a narrative story that allows some interaction, mainly serving progress, it can manage to suck you in and make you want to finish it. Which is the way that everyone should experience this game:Play it once, enjoy and experience the story to it's fullest and end, and keep that experience with you. But probably not play it again.Priced 10 at time of writing, a 50% off should certainly justify the purchase of this title.Get this game if you are interested in a good story and are curious about American McGee's version of the Alice universe. Put the game on easy (there are no achievements to speak of) and try to muscle through the platforming, and you'll be rewarded with a worthy storyline, well narrated and voiced appropriately.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a mad game: its style is mad, its soundtrack is mad, even its story is mad. Alice and every character are crazy and I fell in love with this madness.  BUT:  this game is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played and it's just too long compared with what it actually has to offer. Another thing I can't stand is the totally dumb camera while using the lock system, it makes you go crazy. Also, this game is meant to be played with a controller.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is an underrated gem. I think for many people, this game flew under the radar, at least during the year of its release. Quite simply, Alice is one of the best platformers to come out in recent years. Even after 5 years the game holds up incredibly well. The art style is simply unparalleled, the ominous music and dark vibes are enthralling and the game is stunning all around. The combat is definitely solid, perhaps the only area  that isn't stellar are the platforming sections. However, I really don’t find as much fault with these sections as others have. The only major fault I have is that the PC version by default is capped at 30 fps. There was no need for this at all. (This can be changed in an .ini file)If you haven’t played this game yet, please, do yourself a favor and pick it up!  "

I have pc that runs witcher 3 smoothly with high settings, and this game lags if there's plenty of enemies in the battle.Overall rating: 4.3/5Ps. It's summer sale.

												It's really good... yet flawed. The game is excessively linear and can feel a bit repetitive after the first chapters. There's a lot of platforming sections, and I really think you should use a controller to be more precise with your movements. Also unlocking the 30 fps cap helps a lot because it will obviously make the game feel a lot more responsive. You are also sometimes presented with puzzles and mini-games, but these tend to be very basic and fail to result interesting... some of the mini-games simply outstay their welcome. The combat is fast and feels good, thanks to interesting weapons and some creative enemies. Yet the camera does sometimes go nuts when you lock on targets, it gets stuck in the most unconvenient of angles.Aside from solving puzzles, fighting stuff and jumping from platform to platform, the game doesn't really offer much more in terms of gameplay. It took me 12 hours to finish it on hard difficulty and I have to say I don't really feel like going for a second playthrough. I guess I could raise the difficulty to nightmare, find all the collectibles (they add details to the main story) and maybe change the voice acting to my native language but... 12 more hours are going to feel like a lot of time now that I know how the story unfolds.The narrative and writing in this game is what really got me, I think it's pretty good. Many things are left unclear because Alice is costantly in a state of deep mental confusion, so that you are left with interpreting a lot of stuff on your own. Including the meaning of the ending sequence. The developers have revealed what you may call the canonical meaning for the ending of the game, but it doesn't really feel much of a payoff to me, so I am willing to simply reject it in favour of my own interpretation. Another strong aspect in the game is the overall graphical design. Every chapter takes place in completely different landscapes, and all of them feel very inspired and sick. The screenshots in the store page don't really show you that much, but this is a game where Alice's mind is on the verge of complete and utter madness, so don't expect Wonderland to look all cute and safe. Even the real world sections are great and succeed in depicting industrial London as a grim, dirty and vicious place. The beginning of chapter 2 is the only part of the game which I didn't like from a graphical standpoint, but that section lasts merely half an hour.Keep in mind that you will need to activate the game via an EA account before you can play it, and that buying it from Steam will NOT give you access to the DLC and to the original game American McGee's Alice... though it is possible to unlock the DLC by changing a single parameter in the same .ini file that you need to tweak in order to get rid of the fps cap.To summarize, avoid the game if you don't like platforming. Do not expect any replay value unless you like hunting for collectibles. Use a controller, enjoy the writing and aesthetics and don't miss the train!			"

												I love Alice:Madness Returns. It's a wonderful perspective of the classic Alice in Wonderland story. It centers around Alice being insane, suffering from the guilt of killing her family by accidentally setting her house on fire while everyone was trapped inside. (Don't worry, by the way: none of this is spoiler) Bereft of a home she's forced to move into an orphanage for kids with troubled pasts. While there she gets treated by a psychologist who advises her to create a ""happy place"" in her mind, also know as ""Wonderland"". However, her inner turmoil slowly begins to pervade and poison Wonderland, causing it to decay and fall apart. Throughout the game her favoriate imaginary pet/spirit animal/Jiminy Cricket Cheshire, along with the other iconic characters of the book, guides her through her tattered mind in an attempt to help fix Wonderland, and, by extension, herself. However as she digs deeper into her mind, she finds that all is not how it seems.The game is absolutely beautiful; everything you would have read in the book is here is this game, but completely reimagined to fit the new story. Most of time, you'll be tempted to just stop and oggle at all the beautiful, colorful structures there are. The developers attempted to encompass quite a couple different art styles in the game as well. There's one chapter where everything has been imagined as if it came off the scroll of a traditional Japanese painting. It's eery but still beautiful at the same time.It's your traditional platformer; not much to say here. You run, you jump, you try to keep from falling. That's not really the most difficult part of the game, but it can be challenging when the platforms move around so creatively. It gets difficult at some very rare times, but not so much to become frustrating.The part that sold me the most was the fighting. Over time Alice is equipped with a unique arsenal of weapons, each specifically tailored to handle a particular set of enemies. She has a knife for elegant-yet-deadly combos, a hobby horse for hard-hitting skull-bashing, a pepper shaker that doubles as an smg, a tea kettle cannon ('nuff said), and a dainty little umbrella to repel and block the heavy hits she can take. And if all of that isn't enough she come fitted with a dodge that allows her back-stab/smash just anyone that gets in her way, which, in this game, is just about everyone.Overall, the game attempts to have a little something for everybody, at least, those interested in RPGs, anyway. There's puzzles, fighting gauntlets, 2D and 3D platforming, ball-rolling puzzles, shmupping, and some other stuff I've probably missed. If some of those don't tickle you, then don't worry. They happen in chapter formation, so even if you don't like a particular mechanic, you won't see it for too terribly long.The game is great! I would totally buy it if you love beautiful scenery and excellent fights!			"

												Alice: Madness Returns, the sequel to American McGee's Alice, is an incredibly pretty game. That's not the only similarity it has to its predecessor - on many levels it feels like a game lifted straight out of 2000. It belongs to the long abandoned genre of 'action adventure', a careful mix of platforming and combat sections on linear levels with just a faint hint of collect-a-thon. From the very beginning, it's worth adjusting your expectations to this.Individually, the gameplay elements are.. well, solid. The platforming is accurate (a triple jump from the very start!), the combat is varied and allows for both melee 'bash them in the face' or ranged 'blow them up from afar' playstyles, and the minigames that show up are amusing interludes. The level design, as mentioned, is linear but once again solid with a hint system built into the very mechanics of the game for when you get lost.A number of concessions are made to modern game design, for the better, and Spicy Horse should be commended for this. The minigames can be skipped if you don't like them, the difficulty can be adjusted on the fly, and picking up collectables is not needed to progress. Most importantly for me, when the you enter a section of a level the camera pans to where the exit/destination is - and then pans back showing you the route you need to take. This one change alone eliminates a lot of the frustrations I've had with other similar games. A good job was also done in making gameplay mechanics serve a function both in platforming and combat (for example bombs could be dropped in combat for damage/distraction, but also on pressure plates for platforming puzzles).The game truly breaks its shackles of mediocrity and blandness in the art design and direction. The levels and areas are simply stunning, many set pieces are breathtaking, and it's clear that a lot of love and effort was put into this. Even when the level design doesn't hold up or gets repetitive, the look and feel of the levels continues to shift and hold your attention, not to mention the things added to 'hidden' areas that the average player might not even find. Moreover, enemy types are made unique to the areas (even if they have the same or similar attack patterns/moves). There truly is an atmosphere to the chapters, and indeed as you progress through the game it becomes ever more unnerving and unsettling. A lot of the atmosphere could be credited to the music as well. Whilst the original game had a much more 'active' soundtrack, this is more ambient and stays in the background, and it fits. As a spoiler, there is a level where you're slowly descending into the heart of a castle (literally) and the background track has the thump of a beating heart worked in, making the experience creeepier.On top of all this, there is a plot that is beyond the average. Heavily foreshadowed and sometimes heavyhanded, it still left me feeling uncomfortable and disconcerted. In the interest of avoiding spoilers I won't give details, but suffice it to say that it won't leave you wondering if the game had a writer at all (as some games do).For me, this game was right up my alley. My main complaint? The game, much like this review, overstays its welcome, and could have done with being cut down by even a few hours.			"

												Great remake of Alice in Wonderland. It's hard to get this mysterious story but if you get it you will be just: ""Oh my gosh.. Oh.. My.. Gosh"". It has good gameplay but camera moves are weird and its really hard to get into that. Final boss fight is huge, abstract and atmospheric. I really enjoyed this game, played pirate version and then bought it because I want to support its developers. Highly recommend this game but do understand that it's not game for everybody.			"

												I love Alice:Madness Returns. It's a wonderful perspective of the classic Alice in Wonderland story. It centers around Alice being insane, suffering from the guilt of killing her family by accidentally setting her house on fire while everyone was trapped inside. (Don't worry, by the way: none of this is spoiler) Bereft of a home she's forced to move into an orphanage for kids with troubled pasts. While there she gets treated by a psychologist who advises her to create a ""happy place"" in her mind, also know as ""Wonderland"". However, her inner turmoil slowly begins to pervade and poison Wonderland, causing it to decay and fall apart. Throughout the game her favoriate imaginary pet/spirit animal/Jiminy Cricket Cheshire, along with the other iconic characters of the book, guides her through her tattered mind in an attempt to help fix Wonderland, and, by extension, herself. However as she digs deeper into her mind, she finds that all is not how it seems.The game is absolutely beautiful; everything you would have read in the book is here is this game, but completely reimagined to fit the new story. Most of time, you'll be tempted to just stop and oggle at all the beautiful, colorful structures there are. The developers attempted to encompass quite a couple different art styles in the game as well. There's one chapter where everything has been imagined as if it came off the scroll of a traditional Japanese painting. It's eery but still beautiful at the same time.It's your traditional platformer; not much to say here. You run, you jump, you try to keep from falling. That's not really the most difficult part of the game, but it can be challenging when the platforms move around so creatively. It gets difficult at some very rare times, but not so much to become frustrating.The part that sold me the most was the fighting. Over time Alice is equipped with a unique arsenal of weapons, each specifically tailored to handle a particular set of enemies. She has a knife for elegant-yet-deadly combos, a hobby horse for hard-hitting skull-bashing, a pepper shaker that doubles as an smg, a tea kettle cannon ('nuff said), and a dainty little umbrella to repel and block the heavy hits she can take. And if all of that isn't enough she come fitted with a dodge that allows her back-stab/smash just anyone that gets in her way, which, in this game, is just about everyone.Overall, the game attempts to have a little something for everybody, at least, those interested in RPGs, anyway. There's puzzles, fighting gauntlets, 2D and 3D platforming, ball-rolling puzzles, shmupping, and some other stuff I've probably missed. If some of those don't tickle you, then don't worry. They happen in chapter formation, so even if you don't like a particular mechanic, you won't see it for too terribly long.The game is great! I would totally buy it if you love beautiful scenery and excellent fights!			"

												Alice: Madness Returns, the sequel to American McGee's Alice, is an incredibly pretty game. That's not the only similarity it has to its predecessor - on many levels it feels like a game lifted straight out of 2000. It belongs to the long abandoned genre of 'action adventure', a careful mix of platforming and combat sections on linear levels with just a faint hint of collect-a-thon. From the very beginning, it's worth adjusting your expectations to this.Individually, the gameplay elements are.. well, solid. The platforming is accurate (a triple jump from the very start!), the combat is varied and allows for both melee 'bash them in the face' or ranged 'blow them up from afar' playstyles, and the minigames that show up are amusing interludes. The level design, as mentioned, is linear but once again solid with a hint system built into the very mechanics of the game for when you get lost.A number of concessions are made to modern game design, for the better, and Spicy Horse should be commended for this. The minigames can be skipped if you don't like them, the difficulty can be adjusted on the fly, and picking up collectables is not needed to progress. Most importantly for me, when the you enter a section of a level the camera pans to where the exit/destination is - and then pans back showing you the route you need to take.

												I don't even like Alice in wonderland that much, but this, this is a gem.The visuals are beautiful, and the story is intriguing. The gameplay is also good, but you probably won't like using the default controls, and the camera can be a little obnoxious at times, but nothing frustrating.I just wish the prequel was available on steam. (indeed, this is a sequel, but you don't NEED to play the first game to understand the story, also within the game theres some extra content that summarizes what happened in the first installment)			"

												The game seems rushed which is not surprising considering it being an EA title. I get the feeling some cutscenes have been cut and lack the contet the developers were originally planning dor them. In the end of the game especially. The controls are a bit rough and i find movement in general being rather unsatisfying. The setting in the game world on the other hand is very unsettling and made very well. Tho it has it's set of invisible walls, to me the world was a huge plus. Something not every game gets right. This of course is my personal opinion and majority could be finding the world rubbish. The game sure had it's moments but I get the feeling it's not finished so I can't recommend it.			"

												An imaginative take on Alice in Wonderland that's story and atmosphere really shines. The platforming is a good balance between challenging and fun, and the clunky combat is redeemed by the wide variety of puzzles, and secrets each chapter holds. Although graphically not up to suff with modern games the unique art style has aged well and really accenuates the atmosphere. Highly recommended.			"

												The game seems rushed which is not surprising considering it being an EA title. I get the feeling some cutscenes have been cut and lack the contet the developers were originally planning dor them. In the end of the game especially. The controls are a bit rough and i find movement in general being rather unsatisfying. The setting in the game world on the other hand is very unsettling and made very well. Tho it has it's set of invisible walls, to me the world was a huge plus. Something not every game gets right. This of course is my personal opinion and majority could be finding the world rubbish. The game sure had it's moments but I get the feeling it's not finished so I can't recommend it.			"

												The aesthetics in this game are amazing -- the art direction is top notch, animations are fluid and snappy, the voice acting is well done, and Alice's costumes and weapons are particularly interesting. Unfortunately the gameplay is boring, sooo boring, and higher difficulties do nothing to alleviate that. Honestly? I'd recommend you just watch an ""all cutscenes in HD"" video on YouTube, maybe try it when it's 75% off.			"

												(I'd like to point out that this review was written before the whole ""I recieved this game for free"" checkmark box became a thing so I think it would be good to state before reading what I have to say about the game that I recieved it as a gift from a friend for free.)This game is awful. Let me start off by saying that I wanted to like it. I had wanted it for years and when I finally got it for a gift I was estatic because I've been wanting to play it for so long. The concept is beautiful, the horror atmosphere with the unique weapons and gothic take on Wonderland appealed to me more than anything. But then I played it on Nightmare mode.I assumed through my vast experience in playing insanely difficult games that I could handle Nightmare mode (and 13 hours in I'm still convinced that anything lower would have been too easy) right off the bat. In playing Nightmare mode, as unforgivable as I expected it to be, I slowly grew to despise this game and can safely say that I will never purchase or play another Spicy Horse game after this.Why is the game awful? Well, here's why:1) Clipping - Clipping is usually something that's never an issue in video games. Usually the developer understands that it's better to underclip and make a few objects that a part of the terrain mere textures so that the area is easier to move through for the player and removes the problem of the terrain being an issue during combat, puzzles, anything at all really. In Alice: Madness Returns the clipping seems uber random and is the one of the most annoying things about the game. Every single texture is a part of a clipped object. Literally all of them. I'm sure there may be a few of textures that aren't clipped, but from what I've seen, every single thing is clipped. So what? Well, now, in the middle of fights you'll get randomly stuck on gravestones or in the middle of a shinking puzzle you'll get caught on the edge of an invisable platform and oops, because of that error you're either dead or at the beginning of the puzzle again.2) Hitboxes and Colision - The hitboxes in this game are gigantic and the way hitboxes colide is infuriating. The hitbox for every attack is 100% garunteed to be larger than the animation for the attack, the hitbox of Alice is bigger than she is so the already large hitbox of the attack easily hits you unless you've made an awkwardly large amount of space between you and your oponent. The hitboxes of the enemies? Also overly sized. This means that while you're already getting caught on every single surface, you're also getting caught on every single stationary enemy. Lovely.3) Checkpoints - I want to punch whoever decided where to place the checkpoints in this game in the face. Let's look at an example: In Chapter 3 once you get into Wonderland, you're faced with a large enemy as a part of learning how to use a new weapon you just obtained. The enemy is uber strong and on Nightmare mode can kill you in a single hit (though Nightmare mode is the hardest difficulty, so I expected that to happen; I am in no way complaining about the damage the enemies deal). Once you beat that enemy? Checkpoint. Great! I won't have to redo that terrifying fight. Then I do a few parts of a jump puzzle, fight a pseudo-boss, do more jumping puzzles and - oops - ten minutes past that initial checkpoint I died. Ah, that's alright, there's no way I didn't run into another checkpoint, right? Right...? Wrong! Back to the beginning of the chapter you go! I shouldn't have to explain why that's annoying.4) Jumping Physics - I still don't even understand them. Ever since the first jumping puzzle I haven't been able to understand them. The ""Float"" mechanic that you're allowed to use after a jump that replaces an extra jump (you can jump three times mid air, which I found to be way more useful) is useless, Jumping mid-air does nothing after your first mid-air jump while the rest just... I don't even know, prolong the inevitable fall? On top of that, every time you land you slip all over the surface you just landed on which makes the jumping puzzles insanely annoying.5) Forced Fights - Forced fights in a game aren't bad. They make the player have to face the strong enemies and learn how to conquer them, and I like that. But when 99% of the combat in your game is forced, you're doing it wrong. When some of your fights are clones of previous fights in the game and they're still forced, you're doing it wrong. When your fights require memorisation in order to clear on the hardest difficuty, you are doing it wrong. Essentially the forced fights in every chapter work out like this: First, introducing a new enemy that's kinda difficult that you have to learn your way around. Not really that hard, usually beatable in the first try. Not a problem. Second, locking you in a room with that new enemy and a pseudo-boss. Kinda annoying, but the hierarchy of threat is pretty clear in this game, so not impossible. Towards the end of the chapter, locking you in a room with at least two pseudo-bosses and a rapid income of high strength grunts. This is annoying - no - infuriating, and in some cases impossible unless the perfect series of events occur.This game is not worth $20. This game is annoying, infuriating, and I would be upset had I spent real money on it.			"

												[Full review of Alice: Madness Returns]Graphics:Not gonna lie, the graphics are not the strongest aspect of this game, so if that's your main focus then you may dissappointed. The graphics aren't necessarily bad though - just not the best. However, the art style is phenomenal. I mean I absolutely fell in love with the creepy environments and character designs. I even bought the art book for this game and have spent many hours going over the Timburton-esque style drawings. - 9/10Audio:Definitely the stongest aspect of the game for me. If you haven't listed to the soundtrack all the way, YOU NEED TO! Seriously, it's on Spotify, I listen to it al the time. It is unbelievably atmospheric, even just the title screen music is indescribably perfect for the tone of the game. - 10/10Gameplay:Okay, so this is where I stop praising the game. It's a bit of a button masher and one of those hack and slash types where the enemies NEVER stop coming even though you got bored of killing them like 5 hours ago. There are several different types of enemies (not too many or too few) that all have to be killed in specific ways. This would be fine if there were more varieties of weapons and/or upgrades for the weapons you already have. You basically end up using the same strategies throughout the entire game to defeat the same types of enemies and bosses are no exception. As for the platforming and puzzles; they're a'ight. - 6/10Story:I'm feeling pretty conflicted about the story because I liked certain aspects (like how dark and creepy both Alice's real life and Wonderland were) and I've always been a fan of the Alice in Wonderland story anyway. However, I was extremely confused about who the real villain was and what my ultimate purpose was throughout the entire game. Though you do find out who the real enemy was all along, I never felt like I fully understood the story even after I finished the game. However, I did enjoy the parts of the story that I understood. - 6/10Replayability:Unfortunately, I would have to say that Alice: Madness Returns has very little replayablility due to it's repetetive gameplay. Though the art style and soundtrack are nothing short of perfection, they can both be appreciated outside of the actual game. Combine the lackluster gameplay with the confusing story and I'm afraid there's not much incentive for a second playthough. Unless, of course, you enjoyed the combat mechanics. 4/10Overall:Though obviously not perfect, I do not regret my playthough of Alice: Madness Returns and would recommend it to any fan of the original game, American Mcgee's Alice. If you can get it on sale, it's a steal. - 7/10.			"

												What have you done Alice...What have you done to my life... This game is for sure in my top 5 best video games ever, from the point of gameplay and from the point of story (starting with the first game in the series of course). The graphics are really nice and the art is just eyegasmic, the soundtracks fit the gameplay perfectly and the level design is brilliant. And the gigantic plus for this game is the accent of Alice. <3 5/5 no doubt			"

If you're wondering about play time, the average is about 12 hours.The game took me about 14 hours or so (don't have the exact time.)

												Alice: Madness Returns is by far one of the best games I have ever played. Alice is a strong female lead that although can do everything, she's still human. Struggling with her own mind you venture through her insanity and pick up the puzzle pieces together with her, figuring out what's really going on, what really happened. It felt refreshing and great to play as a young woman and I think many women will feel the same, she is fierce, witty and most of all, capable.Not only is her world and mind extremely beautiful, you will find many allies and really enjoy the combat. The world is so visually stunning and well thought trough. Her world is lurking with secrets and absurd creatures, and it is up to you to figure all this crazy mindboggling stuff out.If you're looking for a game were absurd and crazy comes into mind this is really the game for you. The combat is simple but yet very satisfying and easy to enjoy and learn. It is a casual game that's hard to not fall in love with. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.Would absolutely reccomend this game.			"

												This game has a decent story and amazing creative level designs, reminding me a lot of Psychonauts. (If you haven't played Psychonauts and you like this game, then you need to get on that.)Negatives would be the lack of options for camera controls (no invert horizontal camera), and the targeting system is very lame for how often you have to use it. Your target will basically lock on to whatever it wants and you cannot switch it directly, you have to turn it off and on (toggle or hold) until it catches onto the target you want, and often when surrounded by a ton of enemies, it's not going to typically lock on to the one you wanted. Then when you're locked on you cannot change the camera angle at all! This is fine when you just need to take out a bunch of mobs at ranged, but not when they get up close. This became extremely frustrating towards chapter 3. Melee/close range is flawed.Also the blocking ability does not have its own button when you play on a controller. you MUST be locked on to something to bring out your blocking umbrella. And if ""locking on a target"" is acting up, then good luck trying to block anything in time, as you must also be standing completely still to block. Your umbrella does make you basically invincible when you are able to bring it out in time. TIP: Also get that DLC early, you just need to lookup what line to change from False to True in some text file. Easy but dumb that you have to do that. The alternate dresses you can unlock are really overpowered so if you have trouble, just use one of those.There's some parts I wish weren't cinematics, they take it away from you and make you watch the little movie instead of letting you get to complete the bosses. That's kinda anti-climactic. The game definitely doesn't have enough real boss fights, just tons of ""mini bosses"" or over powered mobs who become redundant.Those are all my biggest complaints, these types of flaws wouldve been so easily fixed if they did slightly more testing or even a patch.Other than that, I definitely recommend the game if you're into surreal stories and you like platforms.

I would reccomend this game if it wasn't for the amount of bugs present and the annoying camera. I also get framerate issues in most fights later in the game. You now also require an EA account to play even if you owned the game previously. Controller support is lacking, an xbox controller will work with the game fine, but all tutorial prompts give keyboard hints.Overall the game is beautiful but lacks a lot of polish and feels rushed.

												Best graphic design ever. You get into the world and atmosphere of wonderland.Alice is incredibly well designed, she is beautiful in her madness and is hard not to love her.As a platformer is very fun, the mechanics are very simple but I don't think that's bad.Is a very nice world to explore			"

The graphics are really nice and the art is just eyegasmic, the soundtracks fit the gameplay perfectly and the level design is brilliant. And the gigantic plus for this game is the accent of Alice. <3 5/5 no doubt			"

												This game looked, looks and will still be awesome, but the cancerous registeration process made it so I waesn't able to play the game unless I bought it on another steam account... Guess what? Once you enter the key on one computer, it doesn't work anymore!I've seen a playthrough and it looks like a fun platformer/hack and slash though. The story from the 40-ish minutes I've seen looks pretty interesting, but this has been sitting in my library for 3 years with no way to play it.			"

												Take a tour of Wonderland's shattered body. Mindbendingly beautiful and refreshing attempt at breaking the conventions laid by other more popular game franchises, it features engaging game play in diabolically captivating landscapes. Weaponry is devastating when used well and cute to watch.Cons; The larger bosses can be difficult if the method for their destruction is not adhered to - leaving little room for creative alternate solutions.The reward system leaves me flat - Early, I am nearly always too healthy and charged yet later, play involves a lot of time-critical evasion to refresh against ...say... savage Wasp attacks for example but I still enjoyed the battles thouroughly regardless. Pros; The puzzle aspects of the map and some of the mini-skills (see what I did there?) make for witnessing awe inspiring map design.

												AMAZING GAME. AMAZING. With lots of quotes to keep in memory and really open-minded, this game is just fabulous! The story is amazing too! Alice being traumatized by her parents's death, is living in two worlds:  an horrific Wonderland in her head and a sad; boring life IR. And she's giving everything she have to bring her memory back to know who killed her family. I'm just in love with this game. I strongly recommend this game to those who like families stories which end bad or even for those who likes violently but beautiful graphics/games. <3 Thank you McGee for this gorgeous game!  #Tess			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is by far one of the best games I have ever played. Alice is a strong female lead that although can do everything, she's still human. Struggling with her own mind you venture through her insanity and pick up the puzzle pieces together with her, figuring out what's really going on, what really happened. It felt refreshing and great to play as a young woman and I think many women will feel the same, she is fierce, witty and most of all, capable.Not only is her world and mind extremely beautiful, you will find many allies and really enjoy the combat. The world is so visually stunning and well thought trough. Her world is lurking with secrets and absurd creatures, and it is up to you to figure all this crazy mindboggling stuff out.If you're looking for a game were absurd and crazy comes into mind this is really the game for you. The combat is simple but yet very satisfying and easy to enjoy and learn. It is a casual game that's hard to not fall in love with. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.Would absolutely reccomend this game.			"

												[Full review of Alice: Madness Returns]Graphics:Not gonna lie, the graphics are not the strongest aspect of this game, so if that's your main focus then you may dissappointed. The graphics aren't necessarily bad though - just not the best. However, the art style is phenomenal. I mean I absolutely fell in love with the creepy environments and character designs. I even bought the art book for this game and have spent many hours going over the Timburton-esque style drawings. - 9/10Audio:Definitely the stongest aspect of the game for me. If you haven't listed to the soundtrack all the way, YOU NEED TO! Seriously, it's on Spotify, I listen to it al the time. It is unbelievably atmospheric, even just the title screen music is indescribably perfect for the tone of the game. - 10/10Gameplay:Okay, so this is where I stop praising the game. It's a bit of a button masher and one of those hack and slash types where the enemies NEVER stop coming even though you got bored of killing them like 5 hours ago. There are several different types of enemies (not too many or too few) that all have to be killed in specific ways. This would be fine if there were more varieties of weapons and/or upgrades for the weapons you already have. You basically end up using the same strategies throughout the entire game to defeat the same types of enemies and bosses are no exception. As for the platforming and puzzles; they're a'ight. - 6/10Story:I'm feeling pretty conflicted about the story because I liked certain aspects (like how dark and creepy both Alice's real life and Wonderland were) and I've always been a fan of the Alice in Wonderland story anyway. However, I was extremely confused about who the real villain was and what my ultimate purpose was throughout the entire game. Though you do find out who the real enemy was all along, I never felt like I fully understood the story even after I finished the game. However, I did enjoy the parts of the story that I understood. - 6/10Replayability:Unfortunately, I would have to say that Alice: Madness Returns has very little replayablility due to it's repetetive gameplay. Though the art style and soundtrack are nothing short of perfection, they can both be appreciated outside of the actual game. Combine the lackluster gameplay with the confusing story and I'm afraid there's not much incentive for a second playthough. Unless, of course, you enjoyed the combat mechanics. 4/10Overall:Though obviously not perfect, I do not regret my playthough of Alice: Madness Returns and would recommend it to any fan of the original game, American Mcgee's Alice. If you can get it on sale, it's a steal. - 7/10.			"

												There is a great atmosphere due to the asthetics and sounds in this game. The gameplay itself isn't anynthing out of this world however. I would reccomend this game if it wasn't for the amount of bugs present and the annoying camera. I also get framerate issues in most fights later in the game. You now also require an EA account to play even if you owned the game previously. Controller support is lacking, an xbox controller will work with the game fine, but all tutorial prompts give keyboard hints.Overall the game is beautiful but lacks a lot of polish and feels rushed.

												I don't know if American McGee was still attached this (final?) installment of Alice's return to Wunderlund but, as a sequel to his sleeper-hit, 1998's American McGee's Alice*.The action is quick paced so you'll probably enjoy grinding inbetween encounters -- smell a flower, break something... who knows what you might find.I prefer running in HARD or harder modes. If you do too, there might be some frustrating moments when it seems like an adversary wont die. No worries. Just get up, go for a walk and pickup from that checkpoint later.This is the Alice I fell in love with from our first time through Wunderlund.[*NOTE: If you haven't played AMA, Congratulations!, there's more for you down this rabbit hole.]			"

Posted: August 1, 2014
												The biggest asset of this game is its visual style; it is breathtakingly gorgeous to look at. The environments are truly stunning, lending real depth to the tortured imaginings of a fragmented Wonderland. The story line is dark, engaging and entirely adult despite the youthful protagonist and fantastical thematics. It's twisted and downright brutal in places, and I particularly enjoyed the gothic stylings of the game. However, having just completed this game, I'm actually quite disappointed, and it's hard to explain why. I should have really enjoyed this game as it's something that's normally right up my alley - beautiful graphics, interesting story, developed characters and relatively easy-to-learn gameplay that's just the right mix of gaming, cut scenes, puzzles and combat. The major problem for me is that Alice: Madness Returns is actually much more fun to look at than it is to play. I could spend hours looking at the pretty graphics and backdrops but actually negotiating the levels got downright repetitive - if you like jumping from platform to platform then this is the game for you, because that's about 90% of the gameplay. It's fun at first with the triple-jump and float functions, rendered as they are with butterflies and graceful effects, but after a while you do get bored of doing the same thing over and over for five long chapters where the only thing that really changes is the scenery, and Alice's dress. The combat style is pretty simple to learn but can be difficult to master - the odd target lock function leads to weird camera angles and can frustrate you when there are mutliple targets. Most battles end up being fairly frantic but the game does force you to think tactically when facing multiple foes, as you will need to employ different weapons to defeat certain enemies. To its credit, it's not the straightforward hack n' slash that I'd first anticipated. The enemies have a good range of abilities and tactics to counter, though it would be nice if there was a bit more variety in appearance - okay, doll's heads are creepy, but after a while you do become immune to the terror-inducing effects of black goo with an empty-eyed doll's head for a face. Adding more doll's heads does not make it creepier. Just harder to kill...The game does suffer from a number of well-documented bugs, just check out the community hub, which solved 99% of the problems for me. These did not make the game unplayable but did detract a lot from the enjoyment and flow of the gameplay, particularly an inability to access one of the weapons for nearly all of the first chapter in my case without having to exit the game and/or reload from my last save point. Another thing that I found incredibly irritating was the minigames - for some of them the switches in artwork/style/gameplay seemed a refreshing change at first, but then you realise it's just more jumping from platform to platform, just in a two-dimensional or other such different setting. On some of them the camera angles are so odd you end up having to work towards the camera with no clue as to where you're going or what you're supposed to be doing. ""Maybe that's the challenge!"" you may cry - true enough, but it's pretty annoying when you can't see where you're going and you end up dying a dozen times before you work out where the next platform is in relation to where you are. Some of the smaller puzzles, which involve chess pieces, or playing a tune, can be skipped entirely without affecting the game play, so there seems little point in them at all. Hidden objects are strewn throughout the game, but there's no real impetus to find them all unless you happen to be really into your extra features/concept art/character profiles. Perhaps if the game supported Steam Achievements or some other such reward it might have been worth spending more time searching out these items, but after a while you will probably decide it's all more effort than it's worth - after all, it's not like you're short of platforms to be jumping to and from in the main storyline. I do recommend this game, though, simply for being a visual spectacle and an interesting, dark, really screwed up story line. Definitely one to purchase during a sale at a heavily discounted price, as I did - I think I'd be much more disappointed if I'd paid full price, especially given the minor bugs, the repetitive gameplay and the many small irritants that made this game a lot less enjoyable than I'd expected it to be.  Oh, and at the risk of a spoiler, don't expect any ""big boss fights"" until the only one that comes at the very end of the game. It teases you by making you think there will be some, but each chapter usually just ends with a cut scene that doesn't explain anything and tells you to go talk to someone else instead. Now go jump across some platforms to get there...			"

												This game is truly a work of art. The visuals are incredible, both the design and graphics absolutely excel to give you an experience that is visually fantastic, and this factor makes this game nearly worth it alone. Not only is the game itself gorgeous, but the cutscenes are done in a paper-doll style, which really gives them flair and makes them a marvel to watch. It also sports a sublime soundtrack, although the tracks are a little on the short side, and a brilliant plot. Taking up from the first Alice game, but giving enough information that a new player can hop onboard no problem, this is an excellent and highly original take on the concept of a ""darker"" Alice in Wonderland.  I will not spoil, but it is very interesting, and the conclusion is very satisfying. This game also features excellent voice work, with most actors reprising their roles from the first game. The gameplay itself is a mixture of hack-and-slashy combat, platforming, and puzzle solving, with several unique and intriguing mechanics, as well as several segments that introduce a completely different set of mechanics for a short while, offering an interesting change from the regular gameplay. However, although I would absolutely recommend this game, there are a few issues: The controls on PC are less than stellar, as this is a console port. The game likes to tease you by constantly letting you think there will be a bossfight and then not giving you one; this persists throuought the entire game, and apart from some regular enemies that are slightly harder to beat, there is not a SINGLE proper boss fight in this game until the end. Finally, I found it quite irritating not being able to summon the Cheshire Cat at any time as could be done in the first game. This may not matter to some, but to me, it's quite a disappointment, albeit a minor one. But to summarize, this is an excellent game that is well worth your time and money with fun gameplay, great visual design, and a compelling story.			"

												This is a very average platformer, it had potential to something much more though. The game lacks variety in the gameplay which would have been fine if the platforming and combat wasn’t so basic. You are mostly double jumping and gliding between big gaps landing on big square or circle platforms floating above a giant pit. Great platformers like Jak and Daxter keep the platforming fresh each level by changing how you traverse the level with it’s unique level design which is something this game lacks. You do the same thing from start to finish it never changes things up and there is a lack of challenge because of how basic and easy the platforming is which makes the game less engaging. The game ends up being a bit of a bore the more you play it because of how repetitive the experience ends up being, especially because it’s surprisingly a really long game. Combat is ok, there is nothing to really praise about it though. The story works just fine but I wasn’t too invested in it, I did like the ending though. The game has some unique design and aesthetics. Even though the level design is kind of being held back by the basic platforming, it does throw out cool environments and details in the levels.  I know a lot of people really like this game but from my experience, I just didn’t have fun with it. 5/10 (Average)			"

												The biggest asset of this game is its visual style; it is breathtakingly gorgeous to look at. The environments are truly stunning, lending real depth to the tortured imaginings of a fragmented Wonderland. The story line is dark, engaging and entirely adult despite the youthful protagonist and fantastical thematics. It's twisted and downright brutal in places, and I particularly enjoyed the gothic stylings of the game. However, having just completed this game, I'm actually quite disappointed, and it's hard to explain why. I should have really enjoyed this game as it's something that's normally right up my alley - beautiful graphics, interesting story, developed characters and relatively easy-to-learn gameplay that's just the right mix of gaming, cut scenes, puzzles and combat. The major problem for me is that Alice: Madness Returns is actually much more fun to look at than it is to play. I could spend hours looking at the pretty graphics and backdrops but actually negotiating the levels got downright repetitive - if you like jumping from platform to platform then this is the game for you, because that's about 90% of the gameplay. It's fun at first with the triple-jump and float functions, rendered as they are with butterflies and graceful effects, but after a while you do get bored of doing the same thing over and over for five long chapters where the only thing that really changes is the scenery, and Alice's dress. The combat style is pretty simple to learn but can be difficult to master - the odd target lock function leads to weird camera angles and can frustrate you when there are mutliple targets. Most battles end up being fairly frantic but the game does force you to think tactically when facing multiple foes, as you will need to employ different weapons to defeat certain enemies. To its credit, it's not the straightforward hack n' slash that I'd first anticipated. The enemies have a good range of abilities and tactics to counter, though it would be nice if there was a bit more variety in appearance - okay, doll's heads are creepy, but after a while you do become immune to the terror-inducing effects of black goo with an empty-eyed doll's head for a face. Adding more doll's heads does not make it creepier. Just harder to kill...The game does suffer from a number of well-documented bugs, just check out the community hub, which solved 99% of the problems for me. These did not make the game unplayable but did detract a lot from the enjoyment and flow of the gameplay, particularly an inability to access one of the weapons for nearly all of the first chapter in my case without having to exit the game and/or reload from my last save point. Another thing that I found incredibly irritating was the minigames - for some of them the switches in artwork/style/gameplay seemed a refreshing change at first, but then you realise it's just more jumping from platform to platform, just in a two-dimensional or other such different setting. On some of them the camera angles are so odd you end up having to work towards the camera with no clue as to where you're going or what you're supposed to be doing. ""Maybe that's the challenge!"" you may cry - true enough, but it's pretty annoying when you can't see where you're going and you end up dying a dozen times before you work out where the next platform is in relation to where you are. Some of the smaller puzzles, which involve chess pieces, or playing a tune, can be skipped entirely without affecting the game play, so there seems little point in them at all. Hidden objects are strewn throughout the game, but there's no real impetus to find them all unless you happen to be really into your extra features/concept art/character profiles. Perhaps if the game supported Steam Achievements or some other such reward it might have been worth spending more time searching out these items, but after a while you will probably decide it's all more effort than it's worth - after all, it's not like you're short of platforms to be jumping to and from in the main storyline. I do recommend this game, though, simply for being a visual spectacle and an interesting, dark, really screwed up story line. Definitely one to purchase during a sale at a heavily discounted price, as I did - I think I'd be much more disappointed if I'd paid full price, especially given the minor bugs, the repetitive gameplay and the many small irritants that made this game a lot less enjoyable than I'd expected it to be.  Oh, and at the risk of a spoiler, don't expect any ""big boss fights"" until the only one that comes at the very end of the game. It teases you by making you think there will be some, but each chapter usually just ends with a cut scene that doesn't explain anything and tells you to go talk to someone else instead. Now go jump across some platforms to get there...			"

												This game is truly a work of art. The visuals are incredible, both the design and graphics absolutely excel to give you an experience that is visually fantastic, and this factor makes this game nearly worth it alone. Not only is the game itself gorgeous, but the cutscenes are done in a paper-doll style, which really gives them flair and makes them a marvel to watch. It also sports a sublime soundtrack, although the tracks are a little on the short side, and a brilliant plot. Taking up from the first Alice game, but giving enough information that a new player can hop onboard no problem, this is an excellent and highly original take on the concept of a ""darker"" Alice in Wonderland.  I will not spoil, but it is very interesting, and the conclusion is very satisfying. This game also features excellent voice work, with most actors reprising their roles from the first game. The gameplay itself is a mixture of hack-and-slashy combat, platforming, and puzzle solving, with several unique and intriguing mechanics, as well as several segments that introduce a completely different set of mechanics for a short while, offering an interesting change from the regular gameplay. However, although I would absolutely recommend this game, there are a few issues: The controls on PC are less than stellar, as this is a console port. The game likes to tease you by constantly letting you think there will be a bossfight and then not giving you one; this persists throuought the entire game, and apart from some regular enemies that are slightly harder to beat, there is not a SINGLE proper boss fight in this game until the end. Finally, I found it quite irritating not being able to summon the Cheshire Cat at any time as could be done in the first game. This may not matter to some, but to me, it's quite a disappointment, albeit a minor one. But to summarize, this is an excellent game that is well worth your time and money with fun gameplay, great visual design, and a compelling story.			"

												EH.... I love Wonderland. I love the source materials and I like the direction this game went but it feels like it did not quite make it. There are numerous points where I notice what looks like corners being cut to keep this game in budget which is an understandable concern but not something that should be so easily notable by the player. A particular disappointment is looking into the characters section at the main menu and seeing a LOT of them that were never seen in game.Alice also feels exceedingly dim in this game. Not because she's necessarily unintelligent but rather because the game in a not-at-all-subtle manner let's you know the plot 'twist' concerning who is responsible long (reeeeaaaalllly long) before Alice herself figures it out.At times the story moves jerkily like a puppet dangling from strings. It's a beautiful puppet but it doesn't have much life despite how unique many of the character designs are.About half-way through I realized I wasn't having much fun anymore but forced myself to plow through to completion for principle and not to see the end. Speaking of which, if you don't know already the end boss (which is also the ONLY boss) is actually pretty spectacular in itself but the story is handled like someone trying to complete three separate jigsaws at once which ruined any emotional impact it could have for me.Do I recommend it? Not really. That said, as a fan of Alice in general I would have been disappointed had I not followed through and I have no regrets.			"

												The game for money well spent. Something between art and game which makes it quite an unique piece of entertainment. Wonderland is on the edge of crisis and corruption once again which is reflected on the more and more desolated level environments. Lead Alice through 6 various chapters with each having it's unique design and followed by little backstories leading Alice to discover the Real truth.Arcade combo action combat system when you have to time your strikes to make precise blows through enemy lines or just turn on Hysteria mode to destroy everything standing in your way. Upgrading weapons, lots of various collectibles which you have to find by using all the game mechanics altogether. All of these things make this the game what I really like and enjoyed so much.			"

												Madness Returns is one of the best games I have played in a long time.  I do have a thing for Lewis Carrol's creation and by extension, American McGee's creations in Alice and Madness Returns.  The original Alice was okay, but Madness Returns simply takes off as far as sound design, graphic detail/design, and control.  It plays almost like a God of War game in terms of combat.  You have light, heavy, and ranged attacks.  The combat is fun and can be challenging.  It is a beautifully grotesque world created in the mind of a mad girl (alice) and the ""real"" world is something straight out of Sweeney Todd.  There are light puzzling elements and a wonderful twisted wonderland to explore.My only regret is that I didn't buy this game sooner.			"

												Pros:Incredible art direction/aestheticsImersive enviromentFluid combatMemorable charactersRefreshing gameplay mechanicsCons:BuggyRepetetive combat/gameplayConfusing/bad keymappingOddly unresponsive menus and at times in game inputExtremely on rails/linear gameThe game itself is a ton of fun to play ignoring a few cons that should have been fixed during development (bugs/ wonky aiming and lagging menus). At its core it's a hack and slash action platformer. In fact, most of the game is either slashing away at enemies, or jumping from platform to platform. This may get repetetive to some, but that's what the game is. And it's a damn fine looking platformer at that. The aesthetics of the game are fantastic, from boring dreary London (?) to the vibrant and morbidly twisted wonderland. Voice acting is also spot on.Overall, if you can overlook a few bugs that will require a quick restart from checkpoint, and don't mind gameplay getting repetetive after a while playing, Alice: Madness Returns is a really fun game to anyone looking for a arcadey hack'n'slash platformer. Psychonauts comes to mind when playing this so if you enjoyed that game at all, this one is very much worthing looking in to.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a game like none other I have ever played. If you are a fan of Wonderland, then you will love the creepy, strange beauty of this game. Each chapter is rich with artistic detail that looks as if it has been pulled straight out of a Tim Burton movie. Every chapter has a unique look that will make you well acquainted with your screenshot key.While the art style is clever and interesting, the level lengths are quite long and can be a little tedious after a while. Don’t go into this game expecting a fast play through, especially if you plan on collecting everything. The boss fights, are thankfully, unique to this game. They are challenging and had me at times wondering if I was actually playing a mini Dark Souls game instead. The clumsy controls make for an aggravating experience when facing enemies in flight, and don’t even get me started on that umbrella.  Besides the games shortcomings, including a few bugs and glitches here and there, the game really does make you feel as if you were traversing through a strange, yet wonderful Wonderland. There are several challenging puzzle games spread out through the chapters that I felt were a nice break from the constant platform jumping, and the characters you meet along the way are interesting and unique.My overall score for the game: 7/10. I would recommend this game for those who like challenging puzzles or those who just want to experience a darker version of Alice in Wonderland.  "

												Alice: the Madness ReturnsBackground: Big fan of American Mcgee's Alice and Alice in Wonderland in general. Been excited to play this game for some time now.Impressions: When you are dealing with a place called Wonderland you really need to give people a sense of wonder. A:TMR does some really interesting stuff with Lewis Carroll's base material and adds it's own twists that compliments the imagery established in the first game. In short it's dark, twisted and does everything right that Tim Burton's film got wrong.The Good:* The grim 'reality' of Victorian England is grotesquely exaggerated.* Glorious and twisted Wonderland is the perfect counterpoint.* Some absolutely gorgeous visuals, outfits and backdrops.* Thoughtful plot with cues and callbacks if you pay attention.* Honours the design, voices and locations of the original.* Weapons have impact and look great.* Voice acting is decent throughout, huge improvement over original.* 24 hours plus game play.* Shrink/Hint mechanic is fun and helpful.* Very linear but lots of content keeps you wanting to progress.The Bad:* Lots of jumping puzzles, but few are particularly hard.* Enemy lock-on makes encounters feel samey.* Killing enemies is repetitive, use the same tactics over and over.* Limited range of weapons and upgrades could have been more visual.* Dark themes, visuals and language are not for everyone.* Shrink mechanic could have been more diversely used. * Hint mechanic can be too helpful.* Hidden items rarely challenging to obtain.* Retry system sometimes takes you back further than at other times.* Side scrolling sections are unchallenging.* Feels slightly 'console port' like but not overly so, plays well with keyboardRecommended for: Fans of the first game. Those who like twisted and dark fairy-tales. The 15 age rating seems about right.Conclusion.8/10. Great fun to play and explore with some interesting encounters for those that like their fairytales with a hint of gothic about them.			"

												A classic story such as Alice in Wonderland is a bold platform(er) to stand on; bolder still to instill such a dark flavored atmosphere.  “Why?” you ask?  Because for many of us, our most recent memory of the character Alice is bleached Disney.  For me, there was a G rated nostalgia barrier I needed to break through to fully immerse myself in the experience.  Embracing the dark connotations that Alice: Madness Returns has to offer was effectively my rabbit hole.The environments and overall feel for the gameplay pay a solid tribute to that N64 era of three dimensional platformers.  From hidden collectables to Alice’s environmentally adaptive dresses, the developer’s attention to detail is apparent throughout. Further supplemented with artistic story-book-style cutscenes and well executed phasing to/from Alice’s mundane real world existence.  I found myself stopping to paint the rosses and taking an excess of screenshots.I highly recommend this title to all platformer loving gamers.  9/10.			"

												FULL WRITTEN REVIEW:Aww Alice Madness Returns. Ive never got obsesses with a game this much since half life 2. I knew this game before but never really got to play it because i never had the chance to untill a couple of months ago and i dont regret playing it and ill explain why. The idea is just fantastic. A game based on Lewis Carroll's famous novel Alice Advetures in Wonderland (aka Alice in Wonderland) but with bloody, dark, twisted theme and story is just a very original, genious, fantastic,cool, awesome.......gosh im lost for words.====STORY (SLIGHT SPOILERS FROM THE FIRST GAME)====So, the story in my oppinion is very original and unique. Alice Madness Returns is a sequel to the 2000 game American McGee's Alice released only on pc at the time with a ps2 version that was in development but got cancelled. In the first game, Alice, after feeling guilty for her parents and sister's deaths, goes insane. Her madness made wonderland as twisted as it is. At the end of the game she leaves the asylum thinking that she is finally cured from her madness. In this game, Alice's madness and bad memories about her parents and sister's deaths return, hence the name Madness Returns. The game sets in a victorian age London with a Tim Burton-like artstyle (if i do say so myself) which makes for a really beautiful looking game. Alice, now 19 years old (if im correct), lives in an orphanage where she takes medication for her madness. After her therapy session with her doctor, doctor Bumby, Alice is told by Bumby to get some pills from the High street chemist. Alice leaves the orphanage to get the pills and stumbles upon a white cat. She then procceds to follow the cat into a dark alley where she begins to hallucinate people with insect-like heads (i believe its the jabberwock's head). After her hallucination, an old woman by the name of Nurse Witless (a nurse from the asylum Alice was in) touches Alice's shoulder and she then tells Alice to come with her. After that, Alice starts talking with nurse Witless asking her if she was going to return her to the asylum where she was internee in the first game. Alice then has an hallucination of nurse Witless as a monster and Alice retreats slowly in fear. Then the floor beneath her breaks and she falls into Wonderland. After falling through the floor, Alice finds herself in Wonderland where the Cheshire Cat appears in front of her to inform Alice of a new evil that reigns and is destroying Wonderland. The Cheshire Cat points out that the evil isnt from her head, it is something from outside. Now throughout the game Alice needs to figure out where is this evil coming from. An important fact that is mentioned in the game is ""the destruction of Wonderland means the destruction of Alice"" (youll know why later on), thus begining a new adventure for Alice.====GAMEPLAY AND PROS====Lets begin with this game's beautiful graphics, combat, enemies, visuals, soundtrack, etc. The level design is so beautiful, the levels are very detailed and colorful at times. The music fits so well with the environment that youll get the chills like i did. The platforming is fun and enjoyable and neither very hard or very easy. The voice acting, holy cow, it s just fantastic. The character animations are really well made including the lip sync. The different dresses you can unlock are really cool and good looking. The combat is really fun and unique. You have a total of 6 weapons. The vorpal blade is your main melee weapon, the pepper grinder is like a gatling gun that shoots pepper projectiles, the teapon cannon (it has a really big downside but ill talk about that in the cons) is a short ranged teapon that shoots powerful hot tea projectiles, the hobby horse acts as a very powerful sledgehammer-like weapon, the clockwork bomb is a doll bunny that explodes and acts as a disctraction for enemies and finally, the umbrella acts like a shield for low powered attacks. The enemies resemble toys or characters from the novel and get harder the more you progress. The visuals are not the most realistic but they look really beautiful. This is one underrated game that should be played by anyone who loves a good and complicated story like i do. The game might not be a legendary 10/10 but it is a good story driven platformer and it delivers its story bits in a really interesting way. So, throughout your journey you can find items such as bottles and memories. The bottles being collectibles needed to unlock concept art and character bios. Memories being items with the shape of different items that represent Alice's past and belongings such as toys, syringes, houses, etc, that can be found in secret places. When collecting one of these memories, you can listen pieces of dialog from Alice's past and memories. Collecting these memories is a very good representation that throughout Alice's journey she is trying to uncover and remember her past and experiences about the incident of her familiy's deaths. Also, throughout the game you can find these pig snouts which you can shoot with your pepper grinder making them sneeze and revealing secret rooms with collectibles in them.====CONS====Now lets talk about an important thing that is, of course, the game's cons. First of all and most important, why and the hell is a triple A pc game capped at 30 fps? that is so pointless since the game runs very smoothly even on lower end hardware. Another annoying thing is the fact that EA involved Origin on a steam game which if you ask me it is totaly pointless. In many instances the textures can look so low res that you wonder if the game is just loading the textures or just buged. The graphics menu is lacking a lot of stuff such as anisotropic filtering, different types of alti aliasing (the anti aliasing is just ""on and ""off"" without giving the information of what type of anti aliasing is the game using), vsync, ambient occlusion, texture detail, etc. The game can get a bit repetitive at times but you dont really notice it because you focus more on the story. The game's Nvidia Physx option isnt well optimized like many games with Nvidia Physx have suffered. What i hate is that the combat isnt balanced. I mean, once you aquire the teapot cannon and fully upgrade it the game gets impressively easy and once you beat the game you can use the different dresses that give you buffs and when you figure out how to unlock the DLC dresses in the .ini files you are practically unkillable even at the highest difficulty. Im not saying that the combat is bad, it is really good compared to other button masher games, the fact that you can easily die if you just rely on only one weapon is a nice touch (unless you have the horribly unbalanced teapot cannon fully upgraded or if you just wear the most overpowered dress in the game, Late but Lucky) , its just that it could have gone better. ====CONCLUSION====Even after all the cons i pointed out, this game is still a very good game because it focuses more on an engaging story and that is a big part of this game. This is one hidden gem that should be recognized as a good game by many more people and we will probably never see a third game and it makes me sad because this franchise has the pontential to be a succesful and well-known triple A experience. After writing this review and playing through this game i can officially and proudly say that Alice Madness Returns is now one of my favourite games of all time and it is totally a 20 dollar worthy experience. Alice Madness Returns gets an 8/10. It is a good game but ill be honest, the combat can get really repetitive that it almost earns a 7 but i feel like thats way to low. It honestly didnt bother me because i was more engaged in the story and i love games with complicated stories and oh boy this is one of them.If you really took the time to read this entire review thank you very much, i appreciate it alot and i hope i encouraged you to give this game a try			"

												This game is horrendous. Incredibly buggy, poor platforming design, the jumping must be so precise that it makes this game twice as long as it needs to be. You will die a TON if you are even slightly off with your timing. Tedious, my god is it tedious. This game is a chore, I'm so far into it at this point I'd like to just finish it, but every step of the way is incredibly painful and time consuming. I've played almost 16 hours and I'm only halfway through. Pros:The game is very aesthetically pleasing and colorful. I've always really liked American McGee's take on the Alice in Wonderland tale.The invisible platforms are a pretty neat idea. Cons:BugCertain platforming areas I've likely spent half an hour on just to get across to the other side. In the section where you must free the souls in the Lost Souls Locker, some of the platforms will glitch out and get stuck at the bottom if you've failed and died too many times. Of course you don't want to redo the entire section so you must let yourself die some more until the platforms actually start working again. BugThe side scroller mini games are also terribly buggy. I use shrink to dodge some fire cannons and of course it gets stuck in shrink mode, meaning I cannot jump and therefore must start the entire mini game over again.BugYou must change your key bindings in the config file as well as going back and changing them in game. It doesn't recognize your changes if you only do it in game.BugThe cube puzzles only let me move one piece up or down. I cannot select any other piece surrounding the piece I just moved therefore making the puzzle impossible to complete. Poor Game DesignOh, you've just completed a really difficult part and then died soon after? Welp ♥♥♥♥ you because this game only auto saves (that's the best feature of the game btw). You must complete the entire section over again ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Poor Game DesignWhatever health you have is all the health you get when you are going into a boss battle. I was not warned that I would soon be fighting a Colossal Ruin so I didn't know that I needed to heal myself. I had 3 health going into battle and needless to say, died many times. Even when I died and restarted the battle it still did not give me any more health than what I had going in. Design flaw.Poor Game DesignA very minor gripe I have is that when upgrading weapons it doesn't tell you exactly what is being upgraded. The weapon looks different but you aren't exactly sure if it does more damage, has a shorter cool down time, faster firing speed, etc. You just have to hope that it would upgrade all of those things ¯\_(ツ)_/¯If you're looking for a scary, thrilling game, this is not it. The enemies are more obnoxious and monotonous than scary.I really wanted to enjoy this game, but it's horribly disappointing.			"

												The only reason I finished this madly bad game are its visual designs, which are in most cases beautifuly done, sometimes even breathtaking. However everything else is utterly shameful. Enemies are not there to present a demanding challenge as they are a horribly boring obstacle on your way to encounter just another senseless fight. And its mostly fighting the basic enemy in different versions (Ruins), annoying you the whole game instead of giving space for other enemies (Card guards were the most enjoyable ones). Puzzles are so stupid, you'll bash your head against the head hoping for more mental activity. You can fail only because of poor controls. Oh, the minigames... an atrocious attempt to make the game richer making it only even more dumb and empty. The story, dialogs, cutscenes, all of this is a bunch of plain and childish writing culminating in a ""finale"" of zero thrill, zero emotion, I could not care less. I was happy that this game and its frustrating save system ends. Alice: Madness Returns is a resentful sequel to American McGee's Alice and I deeply hate it.			"

												I've only played one chapter of the game, but i love it so far. The animation is absolutely beautiful, the music is splendid, the mood and atmosphere is creepy and chilling etc, the enemies are terrifying, and aesthetically it is absolutely great. I could foresee the fighting becoming menotomous, but so far it's extremely enjoyable and runs pretty smoothly. A lot of people complain about the controls without a controller (which worried me greatly,) but with my Anker gaming mouse, i can just set the dpi way down and it works great. I'd also reccomend (if you go the mouse option, which would require a gaming mouse, not just any off-the-shelf wireless deal) setting some of the utilities to programmable mouse buttons (instead of [Caps Lock] i've set the lock-on to one of my thumb buttons, along with the shrink and dodge. i'd recommend this game if you're looking for a pretty standard platform/hack-n-slash game with a good story and creepy feel. just a protip: when you use the mushroom-trampolines to jump, dont hit [spacebar] until you've reached the max hight of your bounce, otherwise you will waste the jump and wont be able to double-jump as effectively.tl:dr- beautiful game, pretty standard gameplay, mouse and keyboard works if you have a programmable mouse (low DPI), and i reccomend this game			"

												Alice Madness Returns can be very fun, and for the most part it is - but it can also be tedious. It has never been patched (thanks, EA) and suffers some bugs and glitches and performance issues (plus its an obvious console ports with the usual problems).It plays well enough however (better with controller), platforming is a lot of fun, combat is alright, like a watered-down spectacle fighter, story is just a creepy/crazy/mad as you'd expect... its a good sequel to the first Alice game, I would just hope it was more polish. And a bit more trimmed - some levels are just too long and some parts are superflouos. Thankfully you can skip some of the (many) minigames included.Either way, its a fun game. Unfortunately it is very expensive in Europe still.			"

Promising game fails to deliver to the fullNote: after replaying parts of it, I've rewritten some parts, being more ""mild"" ;-)This is - once more - one of those occasions I wished the Steam-review system had a third, more neutral, option. I've been tossed between thumbs up and down all the the time - some it really should be ""neutral"". Alice: Madness Returns is by no means a bad game. It's a sequel to the earlier American McGee's Alice, a game I loved at first sight when I played it. Compared to the original, this second installment in the series is darker, grimmer, more mature, focusing more on the evil going on in Wonderland and on the catastrophy that happened early in Alice's childhood.The first couple of hours into the game are stunning, and I felt like being on for a rare gaming treat. The way in which 19th-century London where Alice lives in an orphanage is depicted, is visual genius. Every detail counts and adds to an unforgettable atmosphere. I felt like walking round in one of my beloved novels by Charles Dickens. These ""London"" scenes do re-appear in the course of the game, but all too far and few between, and much shorter than the opening scene. Controls and actual gameplay felt very intuitive, and made me reach for my gamepad. This is after all a genuine third person Action Adventure (or Platformer quite often), and I prefer my Xbox 360 gamepad for this genre.After marvelling at the way London was depicted, I all of a sudden fell into Wonderland, and the visual contrast with the grim and grey London atmosphere was huge. Wonderland feels at first like, well, a real wonder: brimming with colours, flowers, trees and unusual animals, most of them well-known to anyone who has read the book. The game does well in gradually introducing new weapons and abilities to Alice, and during the next couple of hours into Wonderland, fighting off my first enemies and meeting my friends of old, I still felt very much at ease with this game. But, when the first chapter in Wonderland (the Mad Hatters Domain) continued on and on and on, with jumping puzzles following each other in a very similar fashion, and ever more difficult fights with over-powererd enemies following suit, a feeling of unease raised its head. Surely the next chapters would be better, with more variety, better difficulty balance, more original puzzles? Alas, they were far from it. The second and third chapter felt like under-developed, since the visual quality dropped all of a sudden - it felt like etiher an altogether different team developed these graphics (and ininspiring level-design), or out of lack of time the middle levels of the game got less attention than the outer ones.Anyway, I really, really had to convince myself to keep going, stumbling through chapters 2 and 3, only to finally reach the much better two final chapters. Graphics and level-design are much better there, but in a weird way the difficulty issue came back, only reversed. After having upgraded most of my weaponry to full power, I smashed through the different enemies all too easily now. It's a real pity the developers could not get the difficulty curve for the entire game right.The sheer outburst of creative imagination however the developers let flow in the last quarter or so of the game, is stunning: it made me even feel worried, at unease, looking behind my shoulder now and then. I got a few stomps in my stomach as well, especially when the subject of the Asylum where Alice spent most of her ill-fated yout, is touched upon again.In the end, Alice: Madness Returned felt like a partly missed opportunity of ideas that could have written game-history. If only the level of imagination and wonder of the first hours could have been maintained throughout the entire game, it would have been a classic. It should have been much shorter too: at half the length, the less inspired levels wouldn't have made that devastating an impression. Now it feels like over-extending a not very substantial story.Gameplay: 18/30 (most of the fighting is ok, albeit too repetitive, some of the jumping action is quirky)Graphics: 13/20 (the first and last quarter would have gotten 18 out of 20...)Sound: 9/10 (the soundtrack is wonderful)Technical & stability: 6/10 (even after setting the nVidia-based physics to low on my AMD-system, I got too many stuttering)Replayability: 6/10 (single-player only, but it's a very long game clocking at appx 20 hours, and that's without looking for all the collectibles)Steam integration: 3/10 (nothing extra here, which is a pity)Personal appreciation: 7/10 (out of love for the scenes in London)Overall: 62/100Buy and play at your own risk, having enough time and perseverance to continue through the awful middle section.

												When I was just 12 I got my hands on this games predecessor, American McGee's Alice. Back in the day, it was well known for his beautiful graphics with a very nice horror vibe, a haunting soundtrack by Chris Vrenna and a great story. And these parts of Alice: Madness Returns as just as great as in its prequel.The game continues the story of the alternative Alice we met in 2000. After the events in wonderland Alice is being released from the asylum and now lives in London under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby. She still suffers from her traumatic childhood memories and returns to Wonderland in search for comfort - but Wonderland once again changed accordingly to Alice’s psyche and a new threat to the whole land has risen.Madness Returns plays very similar to that of its predecessor, as in most of game consists of the player exploring Wonderland, fighting enemies, and navigating the environments along the way. The game is a great platformer, giving Alice the abilities to double jump and float. To make her way through Wonderland, Alice has to locate switches to open doors or make a new path available. Other means of furthering her progress include shooting flying pig snorts with a pepper grinder, shrink herself to fit through small (key) holes and place and detonate the clockwork bomb.Some obligatory minigames round the game up - though they are either interesting or annoying (mostly the latter).The game is definitely fun. I personally enjoyed the ties to the old game, the way of telling the story through Alice memories she finds along the way that are filled with metaphors and hints to the events in Wonderland.The gameplay can be repetitive, but is still enjoyable and fits into the nicely done levels and lore. The game looks beautiful and has a very unique atmosphere that sucked me right in. Wonderland is interesting, though it could have been more lore-intensive. There aren't that many things to discover you wouldn't see in the main storyline. Sadly, this game seems to be quite buggy. There are a variety of problems reported by the community, but most of them have an easy work-around.All in all, I recommend to get this game on sale if you're interested in a unique story with a beautiful setting and if you're fan of platformers.

												I wont offer up any story spoilers, but suffice it to say that the story is engaging and well written. If you are used to the Disney classic version of Alice in Wonderland and the newer Disney/Tim Burton takes on the story then this will definatly be a very different stance on the classic story.Combat, although slightly repetative after playing for 22 hours out of the last 48 (lol) is engaging and very fun, Hack'n'slash games always are for me :) The gore and violence factors for me are to be commended, I thouroughly enjoyed Alice in wonderland meets Jason X.To me the voice actors were well cast and played thier parts well, no complaints there.Having completed the game on Normal and felt fairly challenged at times and slightly hand held at others, I would say the devs got the balancing nicely spot on.I am now on my second play through, playing on Easy this time for all the secrets, then will move onto Hard and Nightmare.I would rate this game 8.5/10			"

												Twisted and inventive, American McGee continues his fantastic work on the sequel to cult classic American McGee's Alice. McGee took Alice-in-Wonderland in a vagarious direction sporting a dark tale of torment and psychological abuse, whilst creating a world of whimsy constricted by underlying dread with an approach to recognisable Wonderland characters in both a stylised and unnerving manner. All of which is contained in visually stunning locations whilst an atmospheric soundtrack does the rest making for an unforgettable experience.			"

												This is a amazing game. the dark and disturbing expressions being shown from the monster are just great and interesting to look at. It has a simple leveling up system for weapons which helps you to strive to continue playing and following the story. Always wanting to kill monsters and finding the next check point.10/10 for me. Great Experience.			"

												Where to start, where to start...If you were ever a fan of Mcgee's original work, it goes without saying that you will utterly love this. I personally jumped into playing the Alice games without knowing anything prior, it was merely something that peaked my interest, and I'm glad it did.From start to finish I loved this game. The character development throughout the entire thing is incredible, the expressions of emotions pulls you so deeply into it that you just keep wanting to play through. You can really begin to sympathise with Alice as you begin to piece together her story. Each stage is tailor made to help with sucking you in, the aquatic level and the Queen of Hearts has to be my personal favourites. You, at a point get to be a giant cranky stomping Alice. What more could you want?When it comes to graphics and level design, I cannot tell you how many times I stopped just to take screenshots or simply to admire the scenery. Each spot has something special to it, little details that are so well placed to give it depth and character, sometimes you almost want levels to last longer just to enjoy each one a little more.Levels, really decently long, oozing with story, characters developing right before your eyes, beautiful scenery, and all around are well put together to make the entirety have substance, this is all helped and topped with incredible voice acting and sound effects just being the cherry on top.OH! The weapons. The weapons... I want each and every single one as a replica on my wall. The detail to each unique piece is marvalous. The different feels and different looks to each upgrade, how well they fit into the environment, how they handle. Not one single complaint about them, aside from the lack of replica's.. Also When it comes to the hobby horse (my personal favourite), I almost didn't want to upgrade it to the final level due to the black deathmare being so badass.When coming down to it, I only have a few major gripes.. One resting with the god awful camera controls making certain places to get through a nightmare and some if not most fighting areas a near impossibility that is made even worse with the wonky targeting feature. Half the time it is targeting something you can't even hit while the closest enemy is in your face almost killing you. All while you're juggling to get the camera to not be looking at the pretty rock behind you but to focus on the crabs with cannons now blowing your face to pieces. Which then leads to your respawn, generally half a level behind, or just at the beginning of the same fight that you've been struggling with for about an hour now, making it even more infuriating. None the less, it's worth suffering through to enjoy this masterpiece. Afterall, we're all a little insane.			"

												Awesome platformer game, I highly recommend this game. The universe of this game is cool and always changes so does Alice. It will takes you about 10h to finish it and more if you want to collect everything. I don't recommand to play with the DLC dress you can unlock by editing a .cfg file because it will make you too powerful.8/10			"

												I freaking love this game. It's the biggest pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to beat but worth it. It's one of my favorite games of all time because its beautiful and you get great satifaction from beating the bad guys after challenging battles (and swearing a lot at the screen). Some games I find really repeatitive and boring. To complete achievements they just become an annoying time wasting chore. Who wants to play a game like that?? That's not the case with alice. You want to do everything you can because its awesome. If your not able to access the umbrella or can't move on from a level because of bugs don't worry, the internet has found ways around all of that so look it up and you'll find a way.			"

Posted: September 29, 2014
												I have a really divided opinion on Alice: Madness Returns. I'm giving it a highly qualified recommendation based on what I enjoyed and disliked about it.Let me begin with the cons:- Combat isn't always smooth. The lock on aim is subpar, as sometimes the camera angle will lock in awkward positions. Switching between weapons also isn't smooth; switching to a ranged weapon can sometimes incur a massive delay that feels out of place.- Terrible pacing. If it'd been shorter it would've been short and sweet, but at times playing through was a chore because it felt like the same puzzles over and over. Each chapter was a marathon, and the random minigames throughout were weird and not very fun. Time spent developing these minigame sequences should have been spent elsewhere.- Weak puzzles. While it's meant more as a platformer, there are enough puzzles in the game that it becomes quite uninspired and repetitive. Most of the game is ""jump jump pull switch jump jump"" in an obvious way. The last level has some more interesting puzzle/platform sequences but the rest of the game is weak in this regard.- Shrink is unexciting. Shrink is a mechanism introduced near the game start that lets you shrink down to enter keyhole doors and also gives you shrink-vision, revealing hidden platforms and hint messages. However, I mostly just spammed shrink so I wouldn't miss things visible only in shrink-vision, and the passageways entered by shrink were very straightforward. It could have had more potential but it ended up a bore.- Invisible walls. Given how the rest of the game visually is planned so carefully, I think that actual objects could often have been placed instead of invisible walls. What especially made me sad was that there were often gaps in walls that I hoped I could walk through with shrink, but it was just another wall.- Radula rooms. They were really boring, to be honest. Only two settings for Radula rooms, and they're only either battle challenges or minigames.Now here are the pros:- Visuals. Although the actual level of detail on the textures and polygons isn't always ultra-high, it's quite irrelevant because every inch of the game oozes style. It's absolutely gorgeous. It's visually almost like watching Avatar. absolutely gorgeous, except everything is also coated in blood.- Combat is fun. While not smooth if you rely on the lock-on, if you free-flow your combat it can really be a lot of fun. The enemies are generally challenging up until the end of the game. The ""transform into butterflies"" flash step mechanism also works well in tandem with the short Matrix-esque slow while fighting to dodge enemy attacks in frankly really awesome ways.- Memories are good collectibles. I have no idea what bottles are for, but the memories always add just a bit more to the narrative of the game, which makes for much more worthwhile collectibles as you want to get them for reasons beyond ""catch 'em all.""- Narrative. While Wonderland is visually quite gory with heavy horror imagery, the true horrors occur within the story itself. In fact, at times I felt enough empathy for Alice that it was difficult to continue. The narrative would have been smoother if the pacing of the game was more compact, but honestly it was one of the main driving factors for me to play through! It was quite a nice story.			"

												I love this game. the graphics for it are nice and each level is very different. Goes from a forest setting to under the sea. The gameplay can be a little rough here and there due to the camera but quickly you get better at it during fights. The story was a bit confusing at first but comes together nicely at the end. The story makes you think one thing and quickly switches your mind to think another which makes guessing the plot a lot harder. Alice madness returns gets creepier as you play along making more exciting. There are some parts here and there that make you wish they would just move on or wish you could skip but almost every game has parts like this. I suggest playing it when you get a chance especially if you love puzzle games, then this game is really for you. The puzzles get from easy to difficult as you progress through the game. I had a few moments that i had to stop and think about what i was missing to move on which no gamer wants an easy game to play through. Finally, I loved the length of the game its over 14hrs ish of gameplay which is nice and unlike some games a second play through isnt that bad. You discover some paths you missed and fight new monsters. I only wish Steam got American Mcgee's Alice, the first game before this, so i could understand the story a bit better. Overall I would give this game an 8/10 and suggest people to play it when they get a chance.			"

												The sequel to 2000's American McGee's Alice.Madness Returns brings the thirdperson-platformer to hack'n'slash territory, with fluid like combat, and easy to learn controls.The games graphics are far more styilized compared to the first game. Sure this one is a decade ahead in terms of graphic capibility, but the overall style and tone is much more cartoonish, which I actually think aids the games narritive. The original was dark and depressing because that game was just that. A dark and depressing variation on the novel.Here, the world of Wonderland is drastically more colorful. The combat is rather basic, but it's simple enough to not get in the way. This isn't a game that really needs combos. There are a few, and they do do more damage, but that's about it.One of the negative aspects I feel of the game is that you only have 5 weapons. You have the Vorpal Blade, the classic Knife Alice used in the first game, the Hobbyborse, which acts as your strong attack that can break defenses, a timed Rabbit bomb which can press down weighted switches and deal explosive damage, a Pepper grinder that can be used as a longranged attack, a Tea-Pot cannon, which is a strong explosive ranged attack, and the last one is the Umbrella. The umbrella doesn't really count as a weapon, you just use it to deflect projectiles back at certian enemies.Since the game has a hack'n'slash perspective, the limited arsenal is understandable, but can get a tad bland late in the game. The game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing long. If it's your first time, you may spend well over 24+ hours on it depending on what difficulty you play on. And that's all just in one sit down, nevermind the amount of time you may put off on it. Part of this problem is that the chapters are so excessivley long. Chapter 1 took me around 3 1/2 hours the first time I played the game, simply because I wanted to explore everywhere.The enviroments are absolutely breathtaking. The game runs on Unreal3, but they really took advantage of it. The Vale of Tears, The Hatter's Domain, Queensland, and Cardbridge are all stunning to look at. It's an absolutely gorgeous game and one that demands to be played at max settings.American McGee is an amazingly creative individual, and shows that he can once again bring the magic back to Wonderland for a second romp. It's drasticly different combat mechanics may put off fans of the original, but as a sequel, it's absolutely fantastic, and I could recommend this to anyone. Even if you haven't played the first game. "

The art style is just breathtaking. Although it is a little glitchy at times, it has a lot of challenging puzzles and a unique gameplay.It has many, many weapons and a lot of combinations which come together to a very challenging fighting mode.It has a large variety of monsters to fend off and all of them to this day give me chills. It has a very mature and creepy vibe that I just adore.It does gets kind of repetitive after a few hours of gameplay, but I cannot lie, I enjoyed them all.7/10 is fair			"

												If I could describe this game using one word, it'd be ""stunning"". For a while, I've lauded the platformer Trine as having the most beautiful aesthetics. The moment I set foot in Alice: Madness Returns, I realized I was wrong. THIS game takes the cake. From beginning to end, your breath will be taken away by each unique shift in scenery.But a game isn't all about visuals. In terms of gameplay, Alice is a mindless but fun hack-and-slash. You'll often be able to brutalize hordes of enemies with ease, but once in a while, tactics are required. My biggest gripe about the combat system is the inaccurate lock-on and obstructive camera system.But more prominent than combat is Alice's platforming aspects. You'll find yourself jumping on platforms after platforms, reminiscent of older games. As an element rarely found in modern games, I thoroughly enjoyed these sections.The plot is convoluted by dialogue excellent. Wonderland is definitely a world you can't miss.Grade: B+ "

If you want to have a brain-crash just stay up all night trying to beat this is the 5 hour-mark. If you do that you'll feel the effects of this reality really hit you hard. If you take this game slow... I don't think you'll play passed chapter 3. I know I almost didn't. But after beating it it is then worth beating on New-+ because thing makes since, and you realise that chapter 3-4 were in-fact important for the story, but you had no way of knowing that or feeling that, until after chapter 6. lol. This game will mess with you, and you'll feel happier not playing it. But once you beat it you'll see the world in a new mindset. haha			"

												What it lacks in interesting gameplay it more than makes up for in artistic substance.American McGee's sequel to the original Alice is a starkly beautiful game, I often found myself simply observing the environments throughout my playthroughs. Each of the themed levels in wonderland make a certain kind of sense given the series' frank commentaries on sanity. The gameplay itself is a combination of platforming and simple combat encounters that are very subjective to the different ""regions"" of wonderland.

												It's nowhere near as good as the first Alice, but it's still a pretty good game. The graphics are beautiful, and the physics are really great. However, the level design is pretty dry and repetetive, and there is an extreme lack of boss fights. It has more flaws than most triple A releases, but I enjoyed it. I'd only buy it if you're a fan of the first Alice, otherwise skip this.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns продолжение единственной шедевральной игры про Алису и её мрачную страну чудес от American McGee's, от сиквела все ожидали фиерии, но этого не случило. Игра по своему хороша красивый мир, мрачные персонажи, которых мы все так хорошо знаем ( Шляпника, Чеширского Кота и т.д.) и не плохая атмосфера, но есть большие минусы: однообразная боевая система, плохой сюжет, не интересные противники, диологи написаны плохо. одним словом игра на любитетя, но мне самому игра очень понравилась.

This game is similar to God of War in gameplay but has its own unique style and twist. Some of the levels get long but all in all its an epic and amazing experience! I couldn't recommend this game more. I had it for my old Xbox 360 and bought it again so i could have it on steam while its on sale! Seriously give this game a chance! You wont regret it. :)			"

												Alice : Madness Returns is a adventure/platformer game that takes you through various locations, while jumping, bouncing, exploring & killing monsters. I will keep the review simple, list of pros & cons below.+Unique artstyle, creepy, eerie & dark is what it's best described as.+Game runs fluid for me, 60+fps all the time (a few stutters do happen mainly when starting a new level or due to physx)+Physx is amazing, dust, particle effects & other things all move around when touched.+Various locations to explore, half the time you'll end up just gazing at the wonderfully done environments & backgrounds+Platforming is actually fun and not tedious, you have the ability to double jump & hover.+Cheshire the cat and his quotes+Various enemies will be encountered along your adventure+/- repetitive combat, while I didn't mind it others will be bored to death because you're mainly doing the same moves over & over. You do have some different weapons to take on enemies, the vorpal knife & hobby horse for light/heavy melee attacks, pepper grinder & teapot cannon for light/heavy ranged attacks and an umbrella for deflecting some ranged attacks back. +/- Game takes about 9-11 hours average to complete, while I thought it was a decent length, it might overstay it's welcome to some-Some ugly graphics up close-Needed to edit a file to unlock framerate-Previous game not includedWould definitely recommend this game to people who like Alice and/or adventure platforming games with a unique artstyle.PC SPECSGTX 980ti4790K 4.4ghz16GB DDR3 Ram			"

												I'm a total sucker for ""twisted fairy tale"" settings so this one earns easy points from me. It's weird and twisted, sometimes bloody and violent, and makes for a very fun journey, if not the most polished one. Gameplay is a mix of platforming and combat, both of which are so-so. Never too frustrating but never feeling especially engaging. The real strength is the setting and backdrop, exploring deeper and deeper to find out what creepy surprises await you as you press on. It's worth diving into, and I had enough fun with it to keep going right to the end, and it is surprisingly long too, clocking in at 10-12 hours if you take your time to look around.			"

												I wont offer up any story spoilers, but suffice it to say that the story is engaging and well written. If you are used to the Disney classic version of Alice in Wonderland and the newer Disney/Tim Burton takes on the story then this will definatly be a very different stance on the classic story.Combat, although slightly repetative after playing for 22 hours out of the last 48 (lol) is engaging and very fun, Hack'n'slash games always are for me :) The gore and violence factors for me are to be commended, I thouroughly enjoyed Alice in wonderland meets Jason X.To me the voice actors were well cast and played thier parts well, no complaints there.Having completed the game on Normal and felt fairly challenged at times and slightly hand held at others, I would say the devs got the balancing nicely spot on.I am now on my second play through, playing on Easy this time for all the secrets, then will move onto Hard and Nightmare.I would rate this game 8.5/10			"

												Very nice sceneries, inspired drawings and very vivid - on the edge of imagination and realism - this is the first best thing in the game and which I like a lot, unique and very, very few games have.Second and of course not last - if you like hack and slash (very few games on this genre) and action thrilled intense games - this one has a lot on this !If you like many challenges throughout the game and many ways to do something in games and also clever path/walkthoughs, puzzles (not obvious killing everything that you see, but using quite often your mind), finding hidden objects and even some exploration - this game also has lots of these !!Even those who come to games for some horror and a good thriller, they have come to the right game !In conclusion, I would recommend this game for people with rich fantasy, quick mind and a good sense of beauty and balance.

												What it lacks in interesting gameplay it more than makes up for in artistic substance.American McGee's sequel to the original Alice is a starkly beautiful game, I often found myself simply observing the environments throughout my playthroughs. Each of the themed levels in wonderland make a certain kind of sense given the series' frank commentaries on sanity. The gameplay itself is a combination of platforming and simple combat encounters that are very subjective to the different ""regions"" of wonderland. This is largely a casual, adult adventure filled with amazing environments but not a whole lot of depth.			"

I wouldn´t recommend it to anyone who easily loses it and doesnt like a bit more hardcore games but everyone else should give this great game a chance, because it is really worth it. Price is also much lower than it could be, so there really is nothing to lose!+ environment and character models+ music+ combat style+ story and main character+ enemies with their cool fighting strategies- autosaving (you aren´t able to save the game manualy = might lead to annoying rollbacks)- sometimes the difficultyFinal rating: 95%			"

												I have a really divided opinion on Alice: Madness Returns. I'm giving it a highly qualified recommendation based on what I enjoyed and disliked about it.Let me begin with the cons:- Combat isn't always smooth. The lock on aim is subpar, as sometimes the camera angle will lock in awkward positions. Switching between weapons also isn't smooth; switching to a ranged weapon can sometimes incur a massive delay that feels out of place.- Terrible pacing. If it'd been shorter it would've been short and sweet, but at times playing through was a chore because it felt like the same puzzles over and over. Each chapter was a marathon, and the random minigames throughout were weird and not very fun. Time spent developing these minigame sequences should have been spent elsewhere.- Weak puzzles. While it's meant more as a platformer, there are enough puzzles in the game that it becomes quite uninspired and repetitive. Most of the game is ""jump jump pull switch jump jump"" in an obvious way. The last level has some more interesting puzzle/platform sequences but the rest of the game is weak in this regard.- Shrink is unexciting. Shrink is a mechanism introduced near the game start that lets you shrink down to enter keyhole doors and also gives you shrink-vision, revealing hidden platforms and hint messages. However, I mostly just spammed shrink so I wouldn't miss things visible only in shrink-vision, and the passageways entered by shrink were very straightforward. It could have had more potential but it ended up a bore.- Invisible walls. Given how the rest of the game visually is planned so carefully, I think that actual objects could often have been placed instead of invisible walls. What especially made me sad was that there were often gaps in walls that I hoped I could walk through with shrink, but it was just another wall.- Radula rooms. They were really boring, to be honest. Only two settings for Radula rooms, and they're only either battle challenges or minigames.Now here are the pros:- Visuals. Although the actual level of detail on the textures and polygons isn't always ultra-high, it's quite irrelevant because every inch of the game oozes style. It's absolutely gorgeous. It's visually almost like watching Avatar. absolutely gorgeous, except everything is also coated in blood.- Combat is fun. While not smooth if you rely on the lock-on, if you free-flow your combat it can really be a lot of fun. The enemies are generally challenging up until the end of the game. The ""transform into butterflies"" flash step mechanism also works well in tandem with the short Matrix-esque slow while fighting to dodge enemy attacks in frankly really awesome ways.- Memories are good collectibles. I have no idea what bottles are for, but the memories always add just a bit more to the narrative of the game, which makes for much more worthwhile collectibles as you want to get them for reasons beyond ""catch 'em all.""- Narrative. While Wonderland is visually quite gory with heavy horror imagery, the true horrors occur within the story itself. In fact, at times I felt enough empathy for Alice that it was difficult to continue. The narrative would have been smoother if the pacing of the game was more compact, but honestly it was one of the main driving factors for me to play through! It was quite a nice story.			"

												The sequel to 2000's American McGee's Alice.Madness Returns brings the thirdperson-platformer to hack'n'slash territory, with fluid like combat, and easy to learn controls.The games graphics are far more styilized compared to the first game. Sure this one is a decade ahead in terms of graphic capibility, but the overall style and tone is much more cartoonish, which I actually think aids the games narritive. The original was dark and depressing because that game was just that. A dark and depressing variation on the novel.Here, the world of Wonderland is drastically more colorful. The combat is rather basic, but it's simple enough to not get in the way. This isn't a game that really needs combos. There are a few, and they do do more damage, but that's about it.One of the negative aspects I feel of the game is that you only have 5 weapons. You have the Vorpal Blade, the classic Knife Alice used in the first game, the Hobbyborse, which acts as your strong attack that can break defenses, a timed Rabbit bomb which can press down weighted switches and deal explosive damage, a Pepper grinder that can be used as a longranged attack, a Tea-Pot cannon, which is a strong explosive ranged attack, and the last one is the Umbrella. The umbrella doesn't really count as a weapon, you just use it to deflect projectiles back at certian enemies.Since the game has a hack'n'slash perspective, the limited arsenal is understandable, but can get a tad bland late in the game. The game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing long. If it's your first time, you may spend well over 24+ hours on it depending on what difficulty you play on. And that's all just in one sit down, nevermind the amount of time you may put off on it. Part of this problem is that the chapters are so excessivley long. Chapter 1 took me around 3 1/2 hours the first time I played the game, simply because I wanted to explore everywhere.The enviroments are absolutely breathtaking. The game runs on Unreal3, but they really took advantage of it. The Vale of Tears, The Hatter's Domain, Queensland, and Cardbridge are all stunning to look at. It's an absolutely gorgeous game and one that demands to be played at max settings.American McGee is an amazingly creative individual, and shows that he can once again bring the magic back to Wonderland for a second romp. It's drasticly different combat mechanics may put off fans of the original, but as a sequel, it's absolutely fantastic, and I could recommend this to anyone. Even if you haven't played the first game. "

												This game cannot be described with words, whoever made this game is mentally corrupted, and honestly sick. The new Alice is certainly more mature and hotter than your classic Alice. The atmosphere in the game is full of corruption, darkness, and sickness, it makes you feel really weird. The game has really astonishing story, not necessary in a good way, this is its greatest advantages. The puzzles are somehow boring to me, they are waste of time, The combat moves are nice and there are some really tough enemies, however, it needs some improvements specially camera wise :| , the combat system is similar to Darksiders II, But Darksiders II has much entertaining combat skills and moves. One of the amazing thing in the game is the levels design, art, and effect. You will enjoy this game if you want to, don't play it just to finish it like me (then you will enjoy it less)			"

It's pretty linear, with a great story, beautiful setting and fighting that is at times gruesome and challenging, but stayes clear of over complicated skillpoint placement and weapon improvements. It's just fun, beautiful, scenic, atmospheric and awesome.			"

												SO I want to start off by saying this game is awesome, to all those that cannot play it, there is a workaround and no its not pretty but it works. So just like everyone else I couldn't get the code to work even after making an account but if you open the actual origin DRM and add game, paste your code in it should then be activated. I then opened the game using steam didnt download through origin and wallah got passed the activation.So ea really dropped the ball here double drm is never a pretty thing. I hope everyone can enjoy the game which actually is awesome and I hope this helps for anyone considering to buy this.			"

												Very engazing story... cant stop playing but tomorrow has exam... nice sound effect...*** Activating key problem :After purchasing the game , copy the game key. there is an option in steam '' CD key '' under the '' go to store page '' option. Now log in to your origin account , if you dont have , then open an account. ( i think most people should have origin , its famous as its like steam ) Now in origin click '' Redeem the key '' option , input the key and this game will be bined to your origin account.Now start the game on steam, in EA login screen login with your origin ID, if it doesnt work then open an account in EA website ( thats very easy ) Then login again through steam and EA will not ask for any key as you activated it in origin.Thats dame easy...just do a little effort.....

												Visually striking, with a unique aesthetic. Dreamlike landscapes of wonderland mixed with decaying ruins and twisted memories. Graphycally and artistically is top notch.An action platformer with very solid platforming mechanics, ambiental puzzles, interesting levels  and many secrets to find, partially ruined by the occasional control hiccup and a waypoint system not very well thought.Combat is interesting and quite varied. Reccomended "

												A little wicked but fun for sure.  Controls are better with a controller, I, personally, didn't like the movement of the camera with the mouse (way too fast). Anyway, works very well with a controller.Combat system is not always flawless and can you get frustrated. Certainly when you lock on to an enemy and you are attacked and the dodge function does not work. Then you lose health, and if that happens often you can do the level again. And that's frustrating.Environments are sometimes beautiful and varied and really gives you a sense of wicked wonderland. But on the other hand a part of the environment is boring and monotonous, and that is unfortunate, because it could have been better.Characters in the game are well made ​​and provide some depth in conjunction with the cutscenes, but do not expect too much. It is a debatable point: the memories that you should seek help with any depth in the game, while on the other hand you, as a player, are demolishing teapots and are  jumping on platforms.Conclusion: a fair game that I recommend to play with a controller. A big advantage is that you can easily play a few minutes given the regular autosaves, but it has some downsides which can get you a little frustrated.			"

												Chapter 1 AMAZING, then.... wait until chapter 5 for it to pick back up. But Chapter 5-7 makes you wonder what...what-what-what.... then brain crash. Wish this game was ONLY Chapter 1, then chapter 5-7. Everything else seemed completely mindless, pointless, and the puzzles for 2-4 really sucked.How I see it. If you want to have a brain-crash just stay up all night trying to beat this is the 5 hour-mark. If you do that you'll feel the effects of this reality really hit you hard. If you take this game slow... I don't think you'll play passed chapter 3. I know I almost didn't. But after beating it it is then worth beating on New-+ because thing makes since, and you realise that chapter 3-4 were in-fact important for the story, but you had no way of knowing that or feeling that, until after chapter 6. lol. This game will mess with you, and you'll feel happier not playing it. But once you beat it you'll see the world in a new mindset. haha			"

												Twisted and inventive, American McGee continues his fantastic work on the sequel to cult classic American McGee's Alice. McGee took Alice-in-Wonderland in a vagarious direction sporting a dark tale of torment and psychological abuse, whilst creating a world of whimsy constricted by underlying dread with an approach to recognisable Wonderland characters in both a stylised and unnerving manner. All of which is contained in visually stunning locations whilst an atmospheric soundtrack does the rest making for an unforgettable experience.			"

												Mixed feelings on this one.+ Great Soundtrack (give or take a few weak tracks)+ The real world segments are all fairly interesting+ Those Samurai Wasps were pretty sweet+ It's interesting that the final boss is a physical representation of  molestation  which is consistent with the game's underlying theme of child abuse. This part is kind of like a poor man's Silent Hill+ The asylum segment was great+ Each level has at least one cool moment+ The entire game foreshadows a single moment in the final cutscene, which I thought was fairly well done- All Wonderland stages are really repetitive and drag on enough to become boring- Enemy designs are mostly boring and similar to each other- The platforming is awful- A big mechanic is platforming on invisible platforms- The puzzle solving is boring- The underwater level is one of the nine circles of hell- Many glitches & bugs- Animations can be clunky and awkward in 3D cutscenes- Most enemies aren't that fun to fight- The voice acting is mostly decent but there are a few that are distractingly badI really can't see myself playing the New Game +, but there's enough that I liked to give it a recommendation. If it looks interesting to you and you can look past all the rough edges, pick it up.			"

												A strikingly visceral game with a captivating story cutting straight through the psyche. Alice: Madness Returns, ignoring graphics card bias and the usual EA post-release bugs is absolutely amazing. It holds a balance between action and platforming, holding its own as a unique game and experience. You're treated to memorable visuals where your finger hovers over the screenshot key and working through strategy, more so important in this game than random button mashing. The controls are console dominated, camera angles also but I'd still give this game 9.5/10. Worth the trip at regular and sale price and find yourself in Wonderland again, a realm of dark fantasy with a heart of caustic truths.			"

												I have many, many feelings about this game. It's gorgeous to look at with great visuals and really cool locations and great aesthetics. The storyline was solid with bits and pieces shown to you just enough to keep you guessing where it was going to take you. And as a platformer, it's pretty darn fun. Having played and enjoyed the first one, I really liked going back into Wonderland.However. The game has mini-games interspersed throughout the levels that with the exepction of one (the chess pieces), suck. The addition of items to find doesn't really add anything to the game and makes it feel less of a puzzle-platformer and more of a hunt-and-find platformer. The memories are a good item but the bottles and snouts...not so much.Overall, if you played and enjoyed the original Alice or if you really like the idea of Wonderland and seeing various themes of it, I'd recommend this game. But if neither one of these things interests you, I'd stay away. "

												Alice : Madness Returns is a adventure/platformer game that takes you through various locations, while jumping, bouncing, exploring & killing monsters. I will keep the review simple, list of pros & cons below.+Unique artstyle, creepy, eerie & dark is what it's best described as.+Game runs fluid for me, 60+fps all the time (a few stutters do happen mainly when starting a new level or due to physx)+Physx is amazing, dust, particle effects & other things all move around when touched.+Various locations to explore, half the time you'll end up just gazing at the wonderfully done environments & backgrounds+Platforming is actually fun and not tedious, you have the ability to double jump & hover.+Cheshire the cat and his quotes+Various enemies will be encountered along your adventure+/- repetitive combat, while I didn't mind it others will be bored to death because you're mainly doing the same moves over & over. You do have some different weapons to take on enemies, the vorpal knife & hobby horse for light/heavy melee attacks, pepper grinder & teapot cannon for light/heavy ranged attacks and an umbrella for deflecting some ranged attacks back. +/- Game takes about 9-11 hours average to complete, while I thought it was a decent length, it might overstay it's welcome to some-Some ugly graphics up close-Needed to edit a file to unlock framerate-Previous game not includedWould definitely recommend this game to people who like Alice and/or adventure platforming games with a unique artstyle.PC SPECSGTX 980ti4790K 4.4ghz16GB DDR3 Ram			"

												What it lacks in interesting gameplay it more than makes up for in artistic substance.American McGee's sequel to the original Alice is a starkly beautiful game, I often found myself simply observing the environments throughout my playthroughs. Each of the themed levels in wonderland make a certain kind of sense given the series' frank commentaries on sanity. The gameplay itself is a combination of platforming and simple combat encounters that are very subjective to the different ""regions"" of wonderland. This is largely a casual, adult adventure filled with amazing environments but not a whole lot of depth.			"

												Very interesting platformer with an engaging story and some fun mechanics. Although, the game is very buggy and glitches a lot (A LOT) which can be extremely frustrating, it redeems itself with an amazingly beautiful and imaginative world and interesting characters. The game takes no time to have you completely immersed in the Tim Burton-esque world. Overall, I'd recommend it.			"

												I bought this game many years ago. It was fun, but got repetative in the middle so I stopped playing it. I have too many steam games to keep them all installed so I uninstalled it. I came back to it and had some more fun for a bit then got bored again and uninstalled it. Then my hard drive failed and I got a new one an installed it again but didn't really play it so I uninstalled it again. I got the urge once more and tried to play it again but I could not.You only get 3 installs with this game and afterwards you cannot play it anymore. So now this game is forever in my steam library but I cannot play it because I have installed it too many times. DRM - so amazing for consumers. What is the point of this game in my library if I cannot play it?EDIT: Policy has changed and you can now install the game more than 3 times. Thank you ssjkenny for letting me know. I am changing my review to a positive one because my only complaint has been resolved.			"

												This game's reputation as a flawed gem is well deserved. Once tweaked effectively (i.e. kill PhysX) it plays smoothly and looks good on a moderately powered machine which is just as well as the environments are varied and all beautifully realised both in Wonderland and back in reality. You're constantly given snippets of back-story via various collectibles so there's a big sense of immersion.The downsides are that this game is riddled with bugs. I didn't suffer the umbrella issues that many report but the game crashed to dektop at least once per playthrough. As with many EA games on Steam there are no achievements or trading cards. Controller support is passable but not all on-screen prompts have been updated (which is odd considering there's an Xbox 360 version) which often leaves you struggling to locate the buttons for new abilities/weapons. Overall it's an enjoyable romp through the scenery but with 70% of terrain being moving platforms of one sort or another it cann leave you feeling like you're in one big jump puzzle. I enjoyed a single playthrough but there wasn't anything that made me want to go back start a New Game +. I'd recommend getting this in a sale. It was certainly worth the £2.50 I paid for it but not a great deal more.			"

												An okay game. The platforming is decent and the graphics/art are great. The main problem with this game is that the levels drag on for far too long and will wear out their welcome about 2/3rds to 3/4 of the way through the level. I would recomend picking it up in the $10-15 price range.			"

												I'm not quite done with the game but considering my play time, I think it's safe to say that I get the gist and understand the point of Alice: Madness Returns. Basically, you play as Alice Liddell who's deeply distressed because of the death of her parents. But to be able to get rid of her sufferings and to learn the truth about her past, she once again falls into Wonderland, as there is a new evil force that has corrupted it.Pros:- Third-person game- Beautiful topography- Easy Puzzles - You can skip some mini-games- Sp00py !Third-person game: This game being a third-person game is an advantage for me as I get motion sickness from playing first-person games. So to anyone who is like me, this game is perfect for you!Beautiful topography: The efforts into putting meticulous details in the cinematography, scenery, atmosphere, and artwork are absolutely stunning. Believe it or not, I've found myself just wandering in the game looking at every thing precisely. I'm unable to express how the evironment (?? of the game shocked me. I seem to always go ""woowww""  I'M SHOOK!!!!!!! Easy Puzzles: It doesn't take very long to solve a puzzle because they're really simple! They just require the right timing (which I'm not good at, but hey! I know how to solve them!) You can skip some mini-games: Pretty much self explanatory. If you would just like to save time or not use your brain to solve these mini-game puzzles ('Cause you're probably saving it for the main puzzles in the game) Or don't skip it if you don't want to and get the whole experience of the game. Who am I to judge? You do you. Sp00py !: The aesthetic of this game is almost identical to mine! This is the main reason that keeps me going back to play the game - Just to experience the horror/creepy elements of the game combined with the gorgeous art.Cons: In my opinion/experience, the biggest drawback to this game are:- Annoying camera angles - Some of the minigames (omg!!!!! ><) - Repetitive Story (??? Annoying camera angles: THISSSS. This is so freaking annoying! As I try to solve puzzles, the camera angles change and I screw up (As mentioned above, timing is important) and I'll have to attempt it so many times until I pass the level! I believe it's a matter of getting used to. I guess that's something I'm not very good at. Minigames: I'm not a big fan of side scrolling games and there are a few in here that either frustrated me to a point where I have to take a break or it either turned me off that I stop playing the game for a while. Story: For lack of better word, I have used 'Story' About the story, yes, I get it that she's mentally scarred. However, the game emphasizes on it several times that it gets redundant that makes me question, ""What's the plot again?"" I mean, I understand what I'm supposed to do and why I'm doing it but somehow, the repetition just makes me so lost.So this is my review for now! Please bear in mind that my thoughts and opinions may change as I progress in the game and also, our opinions may vary! So please do not say anything harsh! I shall edit this review once I finish this wonderful game! ♡〜٩( ╹▿╹ )۶〜♡			"

												While Alice is now a bit dated (time of writing 2016), the colors and design of the levels make the very best of the relatively simple geometries from 2011 and looks great. The unique story is interesting and in each chapter you learn a new clue that keeps your attention. It's also been a while since a game had actual sidescroller mini-games in it. The dresses are cool and the music is great. While you might think ""an Alice in Wonderland game? Must be for kids.."" Ha no, don't let kids play this, they'll get nightmares and end up like Alice!The bad: This is unfortunately a console port and EA did very little to make it compatable with PC controls. First off, if the game won't let you register open starting, copy the key and add it to Origin, then it'll even work through Steam. There are many forum posts online on what lines to change in the .ini's for removing the horrible mouse lag/smoothing, as well as removing the 30fps cap among other things. You will run into bugs and sudden crashes happen occasionally, but it's not bad enough to ruin the game.			"

												If you like Alice in Wonderland, macabre/horror, and gameplay that is simple but challenging, this is a great piece to play.

The amount of platform jumping really frustrated me, but I had to just deal with it to see where the story ended.  There is a basic upgrade system and there is DLC available (embedded in the game files) if you'd like to replay the game differently, many of the extra outfits for Alice change up the gameplay well.

I note that if you are playing on the PC (which most of them are), invest in playing with a controller. It is much easier to play, and runs much smoother!			"

												Picked this up about a year back in a sale and sort of forgot about it untill now. I'm glad I did remember it, because, although the platforming at time is needlessly hard and the combat is quite punishing (I must shamefully admit I hacked the difficulty in a config file below to even lower than easy because my button mashing was getting me nowhere to the point where I'd nearly given up), the visuals and story telling are pretty good. The wooden voiceacting fits the awkwardness of the period and storymatter quite well. It does a good job of presenting an atmospheric environment that reflects the storyline well, and I thought the character designs were very good. As a platformer, gameplay wise it reminds me at times of titles like psychonauts or the darksider titles, with a slow paced unlocking of weappons, lots of jumping and timed switches, hidden nooks and cranies and several collectables. If you didn't like that much, you wont like this.Along the way it drops hints and suggestions at the trauma that caused Alice her titular madness and I was pretty shocked to realize the full extend of it; I imagine anyone having had an experience in the past similar to the Alice in this title may find this hitting a bit too close to home. There were some bits (like the 2d sidescrolling segment or the dolls head bit) that were not so well executed, the first because it was a good idea in theory could have gone through a few iterations to take off the edges on control, the second because navigating the levels just wasn't fun. Luckily, those segments were few and quickly passed through. Like I said, some of it I found a little bit too hard to get though without some serious cheating, but I found the slowly unfolding story as well as the presentation well worth my time, especialy for that price.

												I much prefer the original American Mcgee's Alice, but this one is still worth checking out if it's on sale.  Though highly repetitive and padded, this is still a fun experience because of its visual design and atmosphere, which changes up more than its bland gameplay does.  This is one of those games you show people when they say graphics don't matter.  Well...yeah, actually they do.  And that's precisely why I'm recommending this game, because its actual gameplay just isn't that great.  But what a pleasantly twisted world to lose yourself in.			"

												My abosuletly favourite 3D third person action game so far. The environments are detailed and cartoonish, and get ever more morbid the further you progress through the game. Am also totally in love with the exaggerated character designs & costumes. An interesting plot makes you anxious to know the ending, and it doesn't dissapoint. Varying enemies and boss fights keep you on your toes and if you've read the original books you'll be even more interested in seeing how McGee turned them into a horrific action environment. The caricaturistic cut scenes are an added bonus. Play this game.			"

												Alice is an interesting tale of dark magic and repressed memories from psychological scarring. I won't applaud it for doing anything particularly amazing as the gameplay and story feel mostly disconnected. However, it provides drive to keep you going, if you can push yourself through the hurdles this game unnecessarily provides you.As a 3D platformer with combat elements, the game is actually very solid, with tight controls and a (mostly) fluid combat system. It's a pretty stock standard combat system, but it's functional and with additional abilities unlocked over time, it does gain some diversity.My biggest complaint is the sheer length of the game. While it looks pretty good throughout, a lot of areas drag out far longer than is welcome. I legit put in about 15 hours to complete this game and  I have to say most of it was tedious and repetitive.Alice is a good game, trapped inside EA's Origin system. If you're prepared to struggle through, you will get a pretty decent platformer so long as you bring a controller. The mouse/keyboard controls are balls.			"

												Even if you didn't play American McGee's alice 14+ years ago this game is still worth a play. Personally I played it more for the art rather than the gameplay, but that's just how it appealed to me. Both the combat and the ""graphics"" are great. The game's combat can be challenging for an adventure type depending on the difficulty one plays the game at, and if one refrains from abusing the teapot cannon *wink, wink*. There are a few puzzles of average difficulty, but they can even be skipped if the player is so inclined. The game encourages the player to look for secret's and solve puzzles as they give one a clearer idea of what's actually going on in the story, but it tends to not be required in order to advance in the game. All it serves to acomplish is to give the player a clearer idea of what happened in Alice's past that lead up to the mystery that drives the game. The story is pretty dark and some of it is left up to one's own interpretation, but overall the game gives you a fantastic plot that has some great twists. The cinematic's are fantastic and ample throughout the game (but not annoyingly so) and the art style varries for the different cultures expirienced in it as well. Everything about it services to create a very ineteresting expirience that the player won't soon forget.			"

												A basic hack'n slash platformer with a crazy twist. I've loved this game ever since it came out and I recommend this to people who get easily hooked on the story and like to solve puzzles. Some minor bugs in the controls, for example Alice gets stuck on some carpet's edges while running over them. Beautiful scenery, insane soundtrack, disturbing details and oh my, those 2D animation clips... The ending's a bit rushed and it lacks a big fight with a big bad guy even though one has been foreshadowed from the very beginning. Truly a game for people who like their games weird and who enjoy gazing around and finding collectable items. Snort snort!			"

												Really great game, beautiful art and graphics, amazing soundtrack, you're the only good looking person in the game so it will help your ego in some way too =D.The gameplay is really fluid imo, although i really missed an aerial attack and had to resort into using the ranged weapons (which i really didnt like using with the mouse), and i really would like some more combos (i THINK u only get one more attack for the melee weapons, and the only other combo u can get is from switching weapons between attacks).As for the technical part, i had to tweak some .ini files to get a fluid gameplay (stuttering and freezes occurred frequently), and the physx has really poor performance on ATI video card cuz it uses the CPU (and from what i read it uses only 1 core to do it e.e) to calculate the things, Nvidia uses the GPU (in my case, i have a HD 7850 and I7 4770, i get constant 60 fps on normal gameplay but when a lot of things happen on the  screen, particles etc, i get like 10-30 fps).That aside i would like the first game to be playable on this game (like the console games or the pre order edition on origin), and for those who dont know u can activate the costume DLCs through the .ini file (theres a topic on the steam forum about it).After the tweaks and using Physx on low i'm really enjoying my experience in the game.BTW the game has a 30 fps default lock, im playing on 60 fps with a tweak on the .ini			"

												Despite some slight issues concerning outdated PhysX drivers and a (easily bypassable) 30-fps limit cap, Alice: Madness returns is quite a solid action-platformer that challenges the player with both periodic puzzles and combat. The gameplay is well paced and sequenced. If you like games with a creepy, eerie and psychedelic story and similar atmosphere supported by nice visuals, this is worth giving a go. :)			"

												An interesting and enjoyable game. It has an original and absorbing story. The main character, Alice is pretty badass such as her arsenal. A little bit gory, implies strong language and can even be scary for those with doll phobia. However it' s not a finnished game, it was released too early, it' s not polish, it has countless bugs (some of them really annoyng) and could do it with a patch or two (i think). Conclussion: A brilliant idea of story and characters combined with bugs and frustrating invisible walls. Don't miss it if you can get it cheap!			"

												An okay game. The platforming is decent and the graphics/art are great. The main problem with this game is that the levels drag on for far too long and will wear out their welcome about 2/3rds to 3/4 of the way through the level. I would recomend picking it up in the $10-15 price range.			"

												I'm not quite done with the game but considering my play time, I think it's safe to say that I get the gist and understand the point of Alice: Madness Returns. Basically, you play as Alice Liddell who's deeply distressed because of the death of her parents. But to be able to get rid of her sufferings and to learn the truth about her past, she once again falls into Wonderland, as there is a new evil force that has corrupted it.Pros:- Third-person game- Beautiful topography- Easy Puzzles - You can skip some mini-games- Sp00py !Third-person game: This game being a third-person game is an advantage for me as I get motion sickness from playing first-person games. So to anyone who is like me, this game is perfect for you!Beautiful topography: The efforts into putting meticulous details in the cinematography, scenery, atmosphere, and artwork are absolutely stunning. Believe it or not, I've found myself just wandering in the game looking at every thing precisely. I'm unable to express how the evironment (?? of the game shocked me. I seem to always go ""woowww""  I'M SHOOK!!!!!!! Easy Puzzles: It doesn't take very long to solve a puzzle because they're really simple! They just require the right timing (which I'm not good at, but hey! I know how to solve them!) You can skip some mini-games: Pretty much self explanatory. If you would just like to save time or not use your brain to solve these mini-game puzzles ('Cause you're probably saving it for the main puzzles in the game) Or don't skip it if you don't want to and get the whole experience of the game. Who am I to judge? You do you. Sp00py !: The aesthetic of this game is almost identical to mine! This is the main reason that keeps me going back to play the game - Just to experience the horror/creepy elements of the game combined with the gorgeous art.Cons: In my opinion/experience, the biggest drawback to this game are:- Annoying camera angles - Some of the minigames (omg!!!!! ><) - Repetitive Story (??? Annoying camera angles: THISSSS. This is so freaking annoying! As I try to solve puzzles, the camera angles change and I screw up (As mentioned above, timing is important) and I'll have to attempt it so many times until I pass the level! I believe it's a matter of getting used to. I guess that's something I'm not very good at. Minigames: I'm not a big fan of side scrolling games and there are a few in here that either frustrated me to a point where I have to take a break or it either turned me off that I stop playing the game for a while. Story: For lack of better word, I have used 'Story' About the story, yes, I get it that she's mentally scarred. However, the game emphasizes on it several times that it gets redundant that makes me question, ""What's the plot again?"" I mean, I understand what I'm supposed to do and why I'm doing it but somehow, the repetition just makes me so lost.So this is my review for now! Please bear in mind that my thoughts and opinions may change as I progress in the game and also, our opinions may vary! So please do not say anything harsh! I shall edit this review once I finish this wonderful game! ♡〜٩( ╹▿╹ )۶〜♡			"

												This game's reputation as a flawed gem is well deserved. Once tweaked effectively (i.e. kill PhysX) it plays smoothly and looks good on a moderately powered machine which is just as well as the environments are varied and all beautifully realised both in Wonderland and back in reality. You're constantly given snippets of back-story via various collectibles so there's a big sense of immersion.The downsides are that this game is riddled with bugs. I didn't suffer the umbrella issues that many report but the game crashed to dektop at least once per playthrough. As with many EA games on Steam there are no achievements or trading cards. Controller support is passable but not all on-screen prompts have been updated (which is odd considering there's an Xbox 360 version) which often leaves you struggling to locate the buttons for new abilities/weapons. Overall it's an enjoyable romp through the scenery but with 70% of terrain being moving platforms of one sort or another it cann leave you feeling like you're in one big jump puzzle. I enjoyed a single playthrough but there wasn't anything that made me want to go back start a New Game +. I'd recommend getting this in a sale. It was certainly worth the £2.50 I paid for it but not a great deal more.			"

Alice: Madness Returns presents the beautiful but dark memories of a young girl.Pros: Graphics, Sound, StoryCons: Controls, Gameplay, PerformanceThe world of Alice: Madness Returns is wonderfully crafted, each preserving a sense of eerie beauty.  The sound and voice acting is excellent, matching the world and characters well.  Alice's adventures through Wonderland allow her tragic and dark past to come to light.  A Mature rating is well-deserved.The controls leave much to be desired, expecially camera and combat controls.  Though no support is listed, an XBox 360 controller seems to work and is recommended.  Gameplay becomes tedious after a while.  Finally, performance is severly lacking, with multiple crashes, bugs, and freezes.Alice: Madness Returns, despite its problems, is one of the best games based on Lewis Carroll's classic.8/10			"

												Once upon a time There was a game developer. His name was (and is) American McGee. Now this - yes children, his first name is American. Now this man - Yes children, I agree that's a neeto name. And no children, I don't know why he was named 'American'. Ask his mother.Okay. Now. Long ago (2000AD) this man, along with a huge entity named EA games, released a game named Alice. It follows a girl named Alice as she journeys through her mind trying to find a path to sanity. The mental realm she travels in this game is, you guessed it, Lewis Carrol's Wonderland.This game is one of my favorites. I just played it again and despite it's turn of the millinia grafics and such found it still held it's charm.Did I mention the Cheshire Cat is my all-time favorite sidekick.  I bought the game based solely on its picture on the cover. Good thing I turned out loving the game. Wouldn't want to feel like a tool right?I wholeheartedly recommend American McGee's Alice. Even though it is an anicient video game it's worth a shot. An updated version of Alice was released In a limited edition of Madness Returns. Their is a download for it io the Community Hub.  A web search and a couple of bucks should also find you a copy.! give it ten out of ten Boojums.With that bit of backstory and the shameless edorsment of a game that is not carryed buy Steam We procede to -Alice: Madness ReturnsThis game begins where the first game left off. Alice is living in a half-way house under the care of a psychiatrist. She is working on her recovery when problems begin. Old 'friends' start appearing and pull the fabric of her hard-earned sanity out from under her.Next thing you know she is once again♥♥♥♥♥over-tea kettle down the rabbit hole and having another disquieting journey through Wonderland.Like the first game we puzzle our way from realm to realm running into Carroll's famous Wonderland denzens. From the soot filled streets of London to hieghts above Wonderland this game is beatiful. The puzzles are somewhat easy but fun and the evil critters are fun to fight. The story is well-told wIth good balance of humour and darkness. Of course the Cheshire Cat is back. Ready, to once again, to offer snarky advice or just thumb (claw?) it's nose at you.Alice: Madness Returns is fun.I give it ten out of ten psycho-therapists.			"

												Game is alright, nothing that's a must play but its not bad. Requires an EA account to play but atleast doesn't force you to open Origin. The game starts off locked at 30FPS but you can change that in the config files (pcgamingwiki is a great place to find how to change things like that for specific games, where the files are, what they are called, what line to change, etc). And if you really wanted to you can get the ""pre order bonus costumes"" by changing one line in that same config file to unlock the framerate. Those costumes are sadly more then cosmetic, they are flat out cheats, like one allows you to become invincible whenever you want after about 1/3rd through the first chapter, one of them gives you double damage, one of them allows you to see the things you can normally only see when shrunk, etc... they are very much cheats. The one issue I have with the game is just how long the chapters are, there are 5 chapters in the game and the first chapter even rushing through a bit not trying to find every collectable took 2hrs 15minutes, definitly not a sit down play for a bit designed game... I mean its probable that there are check points mid chapter that would allow you to leave game mid chapter and not loose to much progress, but I really wasn't wanting to leave the level after an hour to find out.Would I pick it up at $20... eh maybe if I have spare money but there are definitly better games to pick up for $20, but on a sale its definitly an alright game if its on the cheap.

												I bought this game about 2-3 years ago (2013-2014-ish), first for PS3, then PC version from Steam and I never get tired of it. The game has a long and mysterious story, the map designs are unique and breathtaking with beautiful colours, even the character designs. Creepy music and ambiances are also included. The game contains creepy monsters and quite a lot of blood and in some cases; gore. The fighting-effects are cool, but the target switching can be a bit annoying, as it won't always switch to a different and/or desired target. There are a few small bugs here and there, but not a big problem to get through the game.All in all, I would highly recommend this game for those who like creepy and bloody games, as well as beautiful places to explore.

												Event though I felt like the storytelling is a bit confusing and sometimes too methaforic, the graphical design of the environment is awesome and the variety of situations is quite variated. Some bad things, the enemies, until the very last of the game feel like they are a bit too monotonous and they don't fit with the environment at all (I curse you, Ruins).As I said, the storytelling is a bit confusing, but the way to uncover it is quite cool (by collectables) and the ending is quite disturbing and shocking.If you like gothic style, mad and disturbing environments and the Lewis Carrol's opera prima, buy it. It's worth it.			"

Though highly repetitive and padded, this is still a fun experience because of its visual design and atmosphere, which changes up more than its bland gameplay does.  This is one of those games you show people when they say graphics don't matter.  Well...yeah, actually they do.  And that's precisely why I'm recommending this game, because its actual gameplay just isn't that great.  But what a pleasantly twisted world to lose yourself in.			"

The gameplay itself is great, but you'll probably find yourself stopping just to rotate the camera and take everything in. Definitely pick this up if you haven't already.			"

												What can I say about Alice. Well it's another journey down the rabbit hole through her madness and her journey to cure or at least learn more about it. There are locales showcasing her inner darkness and her whimsical imagination so there are nice shifts of the overall feel between levels. That and slowly gathering the pieces of her memories either through actually collecting them in game as well as the bits the story gives you is intriguing and you want to know more just like Alice herself. My only gripe with the game are the controls are odd with a mouse and keyboard and make the platforming a nightmare at times especially in latter levels where platforming is changeling, involving timed jumps, slides and changes of direction. Other than that I'd say it's another American McGee classic.			"

												I loved the game I have played the first one too a while back and i really liked that one too though compared to todays graphics is a little out of date. But the Alice Madness Returnes was very fun to play and had a great story thats like a mystery. Its awsome with all of the critters and enemies you get to meet and fight. Its a great game if your into some dark stuff but bits of pretty stuff on the way through the game. But is clearly one of my favorite games.			"

												The only thing this game really has going for it is art direction.  The actual game design was boring in the original and it's quite boring here as well.  This very much remains a typical 90's style 3D platformer with clunky combat.  For a few bucks, it's not a bad buy, but if you played the original and didn't like it, you won't like this one either.			"

												Once upon a time There was a game developer. His name was (and is) American McGee. Now this - yes children, his first name is American. Now this man - Yes children, I agree that's a neeto name. And no children, I don't know why he was named 'American'. Ask his mother.Okay. Now. Long ago (2000AD) this man, along with a huge entity named EA games, released a game named Alice. It follows a girl named Alice as she journeys through her mind trying to find a path to sanity. The mental realm she travels in this game is, you guessed it, Lewis Carrol's Wonderland.This game is one of my favorites. I just played it again and despite it's turn of the millinia grafics and such found it still held it's charm.Did I mention the Cheshire Cat is my all-time favorite sidekick.  I bought the game based solely on its picture on the cover. Good thing I turned out loving the game. Wouldn't want to feel like a tool right?I wholeheartedly recommend American McGee's Alice. Even though it is an anicient video game it's worth a shot. An updated version of Alice was released In a limited edition of Madness Returns. Their is a download for it io the Community Hub.  A web search and a couple of bucks should also find you a copy.! give it ten out of ten Boojums.With that bit of backstory and the shameless edorsment of a game that is not carryed buy Steam We procede to -Alice: Madness ReturnsThis game begins where the first game left off. Alice is living in a half-way house under the care of a psychiatrist. She is working on her recovery when problems begin. Old 'friends' start appearing and pull the fabric of her hard-earned sanity out from under her.Next thing you know she is once again♥♥♥♥♥over-tea kettle down the rabbit hole and having another disquieting journey through Wonderland.Like the first game we puzzle our way from realm to realm running into Carroll's famous Wonderland denzens. From the soot filled streets of London to hieghts above Wonderland this game is beatiful. The puzzles are somewhat easy but fun and the evil critters are fun to fight. The story is well-told wIth good balance of humour and darkness. Of course the Cheshire Cat is back. Ready, to once again, to offer snarky advice or just thumb (claw?) it's nose at you.Alice: Madness Returns is fun.I give it ten out of ten psycho-therapists.			"

												Tips for those who are having problems activating the game:NO, you CAN'T activate it straight through steam, but you CAN use the serial number steam offers you to activate the game. It only takes 3 single steps:First you need to register an EA account. You DON'T need to bind yoru EA account with Steam.Next you go to ORIGIN site, or download and install the ORIGIN software. Eitherway, Origin and EA use same account infos so simply login with your EA account.Then go to the game activation page and choose Alice: Madness Returns, and paste in your serial number.Once you have activated your game via ORIGIN, you'll be able to use steam to run the game w/ your steam account. Voila.			"

												Bite me!I don’t care much for platformers but decided to pick up a copy of AMR while it was on sale simply because it looked intriguing. What drew me the most was the visual design, and this is where the game scores most highly. It’s very striking visually (although the quality of the graphics could be better), and it’s in keeping with the various other imaginings of Wonderland that have been produced over the years. It has a reasonably strong story line and the voice acting is of a high standard too, both of which help to make the AMR version of Wonderland all the more convincing. So what of the gameplay? Well I’m no expert due to my dislike of the genre but the platforming here is fun for the most part although it got old for me about two-thirds of the way through. The combat is okay and their are some cool weapons, such as a teapot cannon and an awesome hobby horse melee weapon. But the game utilises a crazy targeting system that seemed utterly pointless to me and spoiled some of the fun. Overall I was impressed by AMR, and it was fun to play. It has not, however, converted me into an ardent platformer. 3.5/5			"

												Ah Alice, you wonderfully insane girl. True to the vein of Alice McGee's first game, this beautifully macabre depiction of a different Wonderland will have you slashing and bashing through six lengthy chapters. If you're looking for plenty of exploration and collecting then this gorgeously rendered title is right down your alley. Pros:-Gorgeous graphics which still hold up after five years-Memorable characters and settings-Gritty horror interchanges seamlessly with beautiful decors-Challenging platforming and battles-Long, rich gameplay with plenty to explore and collect-Lots of three-dimensional movement freedomCons:-Somewhat frustrating camera especially during combat-Limited arsenal/upgrades-Bit of a basic combat scheme, but very satisfying-Very forgiving checkpoint system, might not appeal much to those looking for higher challenge-Frame capped and a little unoptimized, might not run as smoothly on older machines (so I've heard)The story comes with brilliantly simple and fun minigames that are all woven into the main experience in a way that makes sense but sometimes leaves one to wonder if they weren't pushing for too much, however, it all plays out nicely. I couldn't help but notice that some parts felt stitched in later on leading me to assume it got rushed at one point.Every location feels like it's made with love and with an attention to detail, with a large and colorful variety of enemies to dispatch. A rich in-game collection makes up for the lack of achievements, and will most likely have you replay it a second time somewhere down the line.All in all, Madness Returns is a big and beautiful, action-packed, sometimes frustrating but overall rewarding experience with a twisted story that combines both body and psychological horror which is bound to tickle your cravings for a solid action-adventure game.

												A beautiful game. I truly mean every word when I say: Every environment is stylized, enchanting, made of peculiar objects born within Alice's mind. It makes truly amazing and unique landscapes. The enemies too are very well done.The music is amazing too, many songs I will remember.It has flaws, the combat, while fairly fun, is simple, there are few combos, you can change between your melee weapons while hitting, so it's nothing disastrous, it's fairly solid, but it does get repetitive. The game is also plagued with random minigame segments. Thanks to EA pushing the studio for early release.Still, the game is amazing, the story is one of the most ballsy a game could have.Get this small masterpiece.			"

While it is a good mechanic. Its cumbersome to switch on multiple targets and you can't jump while in focus mode.-Not as many weapons as in the first game.-unlike in the first Alice where there are a fair number of boss fights.

												Bem.. é um jogo muito bom, o começo do jogo é bem atrativo, personagens e tal.. Não é difícil de jogar, a temática é boa. O problema de verdade  é que ele só é bom no começo. O jogo simplesmente não muda, não tem boss, ou fases, você não fica mais forte pra lutar contra pessoas mais fortes, basicamente: O jogo é ótimo, mas é a mesma coisa do começo ao fim, o que acaba o tornando entediante. Eu adorei, porém na metade do jogo eu ja tava enjoada e parei de jogar. Pode ser que no final do game melhore, mas não acredito nisso. Enfim, é isso. Se você gosta de jogos ""gótico/diferentão"", esse jogo é pra você. O jogo é basicamente a Creepy Pasta de Alice in The Wonderland, só que não muda.			"

												In short, this game is beautiful but boring.The gameplay quickly becomes routine.  Jump here, find 1-3 switches, open some door, proceed to the next room.  Occasionally, some enemies attack you - the combat is a bit more diversified since you have multiple weapons, but nothing too special.  On the plus side, the visuals in this game are beautiful.  The artists on this game did an excellent job.  The dark-asylum environments that Alice goes through are always interesting to watch.  However, the repetitive nature of the game makes you wish the chapter was done so that you could see what the next one looks like.  The chapters are excessively long though, and you'll be in the same places for a while.It really feels like the game was polished on the artistic level, but rushed on the programming level.  One example of this phenomenon:  at the end of chapter 1, you get a cutscene with big-bad menacing creature screaming at you, a nice short cinematic experience that tells you ""huge boss battle time"" (finally something exciting after 2 hours of boring stuff).  Then a friend of yours just beats up the creature for you, it falls down and chapter 1 ends with no battle.  The art was there, the boss 3d model was already designed, but no time to program a boss fight it seems.  The developers didn't really seem to care about the gameplay.This is when I contemplated the option of not finishing the game.  Losing my time through chapter 2 confirmed that this is what I had to do.			"

												I waited for so long for this game to come out, and I wasn't the least bit disappointed. I've played the first game, but was happy to find that you really don't need to in order to fully understand what's going on in this one regardless. The level designs are beautiful and well thought out, but some of the jump puzzles are a real pain. I love how Alice's dress changes to suit the levels; it was a nice touch on a great game. The characters in the game are a well thought out twist on the characters from the books and the voice acting is *phenomenal*. Being a fan of the original books, I like how they've chosen to represent the characters and their respective lands.There are a few things I don't care for, though. The controls can be clumsy and it makes it difficult when fighting hoards of enemies. Sometimes the weapons will lock up and not let me switch them out, as well.Overall it's a great game. I guess 'enchanting' would be a good word for it, since it's absolutely beautiful and has its own distinct personality. 9/10 I really recommend it.			"

												If $5,00 or less, I would buy for the visuals and story alone (or just go watch a play through on youtube if you are still unsure after reading my thoughts) Anything more and I would pass. Buyer beware of enraging EA DRM.Let's begin with the good of the game. The visuals of the game are wondrous (yep), and the story is actually not too shabby either. Sadly, that's about the only good you will get with this game. Now on to the bad. Before even getting the game running you will have to jump through a few hoops for EA, thanks to their wonderful DRM. If you get that figured out, then you will at least get to see the game. Now onto the controls. They are not out right terrible, which is actually worse in my mind. Their awful creeps up slowly, showing hints of bad here and there. It wound almost be better if they sucked outright so you could just put the game down before being drawn into it. On top of the control issues is the out right awful camera. Be prepared to inadvertently jump off a cliff to your doom because of this. The camera hates you and wants you dead. I think it might actually be the big baddy in the game in the long run.If $5,00 or less, I would buy for the visuals and story alone (or just go watch a play through on youtube if you are still unsure after reading my thoughts) Anything more and I would pass. Buyer beware of enraging EA DRM.			"

												The artstyle and setting of this game is really beautiful and unique, If the gameplay wasn't so repetitive this would easily be my favorite platformer of all time but by the last level you want it to be over just so you can play something else, if you can look past tedious gameplay this game has some amazing visuals, I'd reccomend picking it up during a sale			"

												  Saw this game was up for sale, so I'll write a short review.  This is an excelent game!  Looks fantastic and plays just as well as it looks.  The story draws you in.  Be prepared to be facinated, disturbed, and angered.  Oh, and though this is a sequel, you can jump right into this game without having even heard of the first game.  Enjoy, and try not to get lost in Alice's mind, or those big green eyes.			"

												The game is a mix of things done very well and things done well enough to be just acceptable. The graphics and physics engines mesh well with the art style, yet the music is largely forgettable. The platforming is very well done, however the combat is lacking in some respects. Having read the original Alice books, the games make many references to the characters and events of the novels, yet is devoid entirely of all of the literary nonsense and madness, at least in the dialogue, that made the originals so intriguing. The story premise is also very interesting, yet the pacing and dialogue falls a tad short for me in the game.It's a good sequel to the original, and people looking for a nice romp through a dark game will find it enjoyable, as will those who like 3D platformers. I still feel it could be better, and hopefully if a sequel comes out to this one day it will further improve upon the already solid series.			"

... Please note that an Origin account is needed to register this game: if you already possess an existing account simply log in, otherwise you may need to create an account just for this game to run.... Played American McGee's Alice way back when it was first out... Recently in the past few years, I replayed it and though it lacked in the graphics department, still delivered in gameplay, story and overall atmosphere... I would recommend playing it if you find the time.... Alice: Madness Returns adopts the same atmosphere: gritty, dark, sinister and demented, even going as far to use similar art styles and level designs... While linear in gameplay, there are still the additions of secret and mini-puzzles that can be overlooked, and while combat only becomes a challenge on hard difficulty and up, you will most likely be dying from all the jumping and falling you will be doing... Yes, almost the entire game consists of navigational jumping and platforming, much like the first one... This in my opinion gives the game its charm and unique difficulty curve in today's games, as most tend to stay clear of this: to me it helps one to really stop and pace yourself, as well as look for alternatives methods of completing your goals.... I touched briefly on the combat earlier, and the combat is very similar to most hack and slash games like DMC and Bayonetta, though a bit more washed down and lacking a rating system... The addition to actively dodge and time your attacks in a crowd works well, and the Hysteria berserker mode when health is low really helps keep the fighting fast and menacing.... I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the old game, as well as those who are looking for a decent length game with a moderate challenge, unique dialogue and an almost tangible darkness one can enjoy.

												I've decided to update my review of this game after reading a few others' on the hub and ultimately agreeing with them. I'll try not to spoil anything for those wishing to purchase the game. First off, let me say I absolutely adore this story. It has definitely influenced my life as I, like Alice, feel that I often cannot escape my mind's tricks.Alice: Madness Returns is a much maturer, darker themed sequel to American McGee's 2000 game (*note: I have not played this*). We follow the story of Alice Liddell, whose childhood emotional trauma causes her to ""fall"" into hallucinations of Wonderland to escape the horrific reality playing out before her. She follows the sly and cryptic messages from the Cheshire Cat, who acts as our mentor through the game.We begin by learning that Alice's family had perished in a tragic fire many years ago and the guilt still haunts her to point of insanity, despite being released from Rutledge Asylum a year ago. A ripe age of 19, Alice resides at an orphanage for the mentally traumatized, under care of Dr. Angus Bumby. It is in the first few scenes that my interest was tickled; the characters' appearances and graphics were very unique, bar a little odd to the eye. The atmosphere is not welcoming, with much younger orphans throwing taunts as we pass by. Alice's interactions with different characters indicates that she is still very much an outsider.After running an errand we encounter some creepy looking creatures that cause enough anxiety to fall back into Alice's safe haven, Wonderland. I think it's fair to state, this is where the true beauty of the game lies. The scenery, sound, graphics, colour... There's just SO much to see and spam F12 at (you're lying if you didn't). Just take a look at this screenshot[web-vassets.ea.com] and tell me you're not entranced. . This is Wonderland. But, sadly, it's not all butterflies and rainbows.Alice soon discovers there is a force outside herself that is causing the destruction of this once beautiful place; the Infernal Train. We venture through different stages of Wonderland, the first of which bring unique combat features, familiar faces from the original story and foes. However, as the game progresses and you've hit a few hours, you'll begin to see a pattern. It seems that the developers wanted to just drag us through the middle chapters and on to the end. I personally felt like I was doing the same level for hours at a time. The only thing that changed was maybe the scenery. Same foes. Same combat. Same old objective. That being said, it definitely picks up towards the end. There's typical Alice in Wonderland features included that are necessary to continue (""eat me!"") and some challenging moments with the bosses. There are also infrequent moments where Alice's mind switches back to London where her real self has been, well, out of it. These are scenes which I found interesting and wanted more of, as they often contained hidden explanations. It's all very fascinating to watch it unfold, but I felt that the time spent in Wonderland was too much, often finding myself pausing for a moment to remember where I'd actually last been in London. Overall, the ending was very satisfactory. After being admitted back into the Rutledge Asylum, in which many disturbing scenes play out, we make our way back to meet our ultimate foe, the Dollmaker. I personally did not realise the true identity of the Dollmaker for quite a while, as I had not made the time to collect many memory capsules along the way. The scene between Alice and this character was another interesting boss battle, with some unexpected moves catching me out and posing a challenge. As a result of this confrontation, we are overwhelmed with the despicable truth behind the Dollmaker's real-life counterpart. Alice's actions portray the true extent of his cruel betrayal here, however we're not treated with any gory details. We can deal with her brain being drilled into and scenes implying prostitution, but not blood and guts? Guysssss pls. I expected a full-blown revenge, instead I got a clumsily animated and out-of-time kaput. In conclusion, I, for one, am very much looking forward to the next instalment, Alice: Otherlands! I leave with you a final perplexing quote from our friend, Cheshire Cat: ""Only the savage regard the endurance of pain as the measure of worth. Forgetting pain is convenient, remembering it agonising. But recovering the truth is worth the suffering and our Wonderland, though damaged, is safe in memory... for now.""			"

												One of the most fantastic games I've ever played.  It takes much of my childhood and dreams of living in a fantasy world and twists them in a fun, exciting way.  It goes to show that Wonderland can be a place of happiness, or a world of destruction that we witness Alice go through.  Alice is lost in a world of reality and the world of Wonderland which she once found comfort in.  Being in this state of mind, her worlds clash together and it's her duty to find the truth of the fire which corrupts her mind and soul -- and the truth behind the deaths of her family.			"

												Bem.. é um jogo muito bom, o começo do jogo é bem atrativo, personagens e tal.. Não é difícil de jogar, a temática é boa. O problema de verdade  é que ele só é bom no começo. O jogo simplesmente não muda, não tem boss, ou fases, você não fica mais forte pra lutar contra pessoas mais fortes, basicamente: O jogo é ótimo, mas é a mesma coisa do começo ao fim, o que acaba o tornando entediante. Eu adorei, porém na metade do jogo eu ja tava enjoada e parei de jogar. Pode ser que no final do game melhore, mas não acredito nisso. Enfim, é isso. Se você gosta de jogos ""gótico/diferentão"", esse jogo é pra você. O jogo é basicamente a Creepy Pasta de Alice in The Wonderland, só que não muda.			"

												This is a very good sequel to the cult classic game, American Mcgee's Alice. with great graphics and artwork and really knows how to continue on from the first game.Pros+Unlike the first game were the platforming feels cumbersome. Madness Returns improved it with more fluid jump mechanics.+Very lush, detailed graphics. Not to metion the various dresses Alice wears in each chapter.+Unlike Alice where is it basic. Madness Returns adds a combat focus mechanic where you can lock on an specific enemy. Also Alice can do a dodge dash, and when low on health she can go in hysteria mode (Just don't too reckless).+Inludes a new game plus for replayablity.Cons-The combat focus mechanic is a double edged sword. While it is a good mechanic. Its cumbersome to switch on multiple targets and you can't jump while in focus mode.-Not as many weapons as in the first game.-unlike in the first Alice where there are a fair number of boss fights. Madness returns only has one boss fight which feels cheap.Some minor stuff-No DLC in this version			"

												I waited for so long for this game to come out, and I wasn't the least bit disappointed. I've played the first game, but was happy to find that you really don't need to in order to fully understand what's going on in this one regardless. The level designs are beautiful and well thought out, but some of the jump puzzles are a real pain. I love how Alice's dress changes to suit the levels; it was a nice touch on a great game. The characters in the game are a well thought out twist on the characters from the books and the voice acting is *phenomenal*. Being a fan of the original books, I like how they've chosen to represent the characters and their respective lands.There are a few things I don't care for, though. The controls can be clumsy and it makes it difficult when fighting hoards of enemies. Sometimes the weapons will lock up and not let me switch them out, as well.Overall it's a great game. I guess 'enchanting' would be a good word for it, since it's absolutely beautiful and has its own distinct personality. 9/10 I really recommend it.			"

												I haven't played many games that stuck with me long after I played them.  The game is visually wonderful. The mechanics are ok.  The storyline is pretty dark.  If you can allow yourself to be immersed in it, the game can hit at a psychological level few try, and fewer still succeed, at hitting.  I'll put it this way: in a world of 90% off Steam sales, if Alice has a sequel, I'd buy it at full price when it came out.			"

												I loved the 2001 Alice, it was a one of a kind game at the time.  While that game was a FPS, Madness Returns is most accurately described as a platformer, with awkward, gimped first person aim mode (the game basically forces you to use its auto-aim ""focus"" mode while fighting) and ""challenge jumping"" a constant throughout the game.  The graphics are well-done for the most part, but game progression relies too much on making a new platform appear, etc. by turning levels and shooting pig snouts with a pepper gun (Pig snouts, why?  I don't know).  Side activities are mainly to find teeth (to upgrade weapons - which is fine, but isn't finding a new gun more fun??) and bottles, memories, etc., which as far as I can tell don't directly help the player and are more of an achievement thing.  Thumbs down for an overall tedious experience.			"

 Positive + Gorgeous art style/environments+ Creepy and eerie soundtrack+ Interesting story laced with dark elements+ Good mixture of platforming and combat sections, as well as many other gameplay elements+ Lengthy campaign (approximately 10 hours on Normal difficulty, almost twice as long as the first game). Negative - Various content reused throughout the game (sliding puzzles/sections, rhythm-based minigames etc.) leads to tedium- Poor camera during combat/awkward lock-on system- Minor performance issues for the PC version (occasional stuttering, frame rate cap (though the latter can be fixed via config file))- Some low resolution textures and texture pop-in (courtesy of Unreal Engine)- Lack of an extensive and memorable weapons arsenal, unlike the first game. Verdict “While the gameplay may get somewhat repetitive over the course of the long and mostly linear campaign; the visuals, sound and compelling story make the visit into Alice’s psyche one worth experiencing (again).” 8/10 TJBs  "

If you can allow yourself to be immersed in it, the game can hit at a psychological level few try, and fewer still succeed, at hitting.  I'll put it this way: in a world of 90% off Steam sales, if Alice has a sequel, I'd buy it at full price when it came out.			"

												Pardon the pun but Ive never been ""Mad"" on platfromer games but this game just stood out from the rest, I've been playing it for seven hours now and I cant believe how much fun it is, the game is not only a fun and solid platformer but offers a great narrative through plenty of unique ways and quite frankly I cant wait to see what i still have in store to see!!!

												Still a good game in 2015, despites some levels overstay their welcome.+ Distinctive artworks+ Thoughtful combat system+ Sinister tone- Repetitive mini-games- Later levels appear less polished- Could use more checkpoints between action sequencesPS: took me 20 hours and 1 playthrough to reach 94% completion.

												It is very difficult not to reccomend this game. At the same time, it is also very difficult to reccomend it. Why so?To start, we are dealing with a very good tale from the Wonderland world. The story, the characters, the voice actors are on par with the best games out there. It deals with very dark and usually untouched stories in games. It would be awesome if the game were designed well enough to be on par with its concept and story. But that is certainly not what we have here.Poor level design, repetitive tasks, far too easy puzzles, boring boss fights and the same enemies over and over again. I have come through that in many games. At least in some of those games they had some consideration for details, such as making the mouth of characters move while they are talking not in a cinematic, paying more attention to make Alice's clothing be more detailed and even sexier, since we are dealing with with some sexuality topics on the game's plot (a lot of hookers around, etc).On the level design, it looks that they didn't consider that a player would spend 15 hours at least to end the game because the level designers made the scenarios boring. And you will see you asking yourself more than once why that particular part of the game exists.Truth to be told, there are some funny and entertaining mini games during the game. But all of them ripped of from other famous classics that you'll know when you see.The last stages seem to have been made by a very different team than the ones that made the first ones. Mainly the Bridge of Cards and Queensland levels. Both deserve some merit and certainly some of your playtime exploring them.SCORE6 - I played the game for the story. But most of the time I was really annoyed by bad level design decisions and boring parts of the game. Also, there is no real motivation for the new game plus that is available after you end the game, since there are no achievements to be obtained and the bonus content is really not that appealing. Bonus points for the voice actors and the character design (most of the time).WORTH BUYING? Yes, IF it on sale on Steam and below US$5DON'T: Expect too much from this game. Play it for the story.

It was released to PC and console at the same time, but it feels so much like a simple port.Nevertheless I enjoyed playing it very much. Now I pray for a third game hopefully unrelated to EA.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a twisted and strange take on Alice in Wonderland and it is amazing! The score is creepy, the atomsphere is creepy and haunting (expect for one level), the voice acting is well-done, the characters are disturbing and the overall presentation is one glorious nightmare. It reminds me of a hybrid between Silent Hill meets Alice in Wonderland topped with a old school Tim Burton flair. If you are a fan of horror games, I highly recommend you get this game.			"

Product received for free
												Alice: Madness returns looks beautifull. And so it is the art that drives one trough the game. To a extent.Because Alice: Madness returns also has masssive problems (that, coincidentally are the same as in the older game).The first is that every level JUST DRAAAAGS OOOON! More or less every level is faaar to long, outstaying it's wellcome beyound the wonder of the new designs and graphics and beauty that the game posses.The same jumping puzzles, the same enemy hordes that won't and won't end making fighting to a grind, the same way the leveldesign is structured (besides the optical elements). It all just feels made to keep you from progressing more then anything else.It just doesn't end. The pacing is totally off and after a while you just want to finally move on to the next level so you can see the next beautyfull designs.The second problem is the godawfull camera. No matter if it's the platforming or (even worse) the Zelda esque battlesystem, the camera is far to drawn in and so utterly infuriatingly inflexible in the battles. It's so limiting that you often die BECAUSE of it instead of the diffculty of the enemys.Conclusion: Alice Madness Reborn is a beautifull game with really fantastic designs and enemys and an equally great atmosphere.But i just can't go on trough levels that keep going on and on and on for no reason, stacking the same exercises up one after another and another and another, level for level for level.Take a look but don't expect to finish it.

												IMPORTANT NOTE:To get to play the game, you need to activate it. The very first time you start up the game a product key appears - copy it to your clipboard ... and then go to EA.COM (the homepage of the EA company) online.The game will NOT activate if you just use the activation code in the small windows that pop up on your screen, one after the other, when you start up the game!REVIEW:Good stuff:- STUNNING graphics, gorgeous and imaginative.- Great atmosphere, mysterious and slightly unnerving.- Good musicBad stuff- The game is basically a platform-jumper (urgh!) with a lot of fighting and some puzzles.- I play on a PC, and controlling Alice is dificult and confusing.- No save option. The game choses when to save your progress.Verdict:While the game is a champion when it comes to imaginative, gorgeous graphics, I found it to be very, very frustrating to play. Alice is so dificult to control that I failed a lot of jumps and battle was not a fun experience. This is especially annoying when you can't save your progress after finally succeeding with something dificult!The game does a lot of things right, but the few things it does wrong, it does wrong to SUCH a degree, that I did not enjoy playing the game. A real bummer!Bonus info:It seems that the creators of the ""Batman: Arkham"" games have been very heavily influenced by this game! Alice's ""shrinking vision"" is the same as Batman's ""detective vision"" - and moving around, doing puzzles and fighting as Alice made me feel like I was playing Batman in ""Arkham Asylum"".			"

												Technically and as a game, I suppose it's ""better"" than the original but it lacks the spark. The original Alice felt like it was pushing the envelope creatively and artistically. This looks like any competent team could have put this game together. Despite the visual upgrade it doesn't feel as immersive as the original Alice. Also, it doesn't feel like a proper PC game, more like a console port. And I got bored with it. If you're a fan of the original Alice like I am, this might disappoint you.Pros: It's pretty. Though that's kind of expect now days. Mechanically, I suppose it's more of a game.Cons: Bland and repetitive. Not pushing the boundries the way the original did. May not appeal to fans of the first game. Feels like a console port.			"

												Beautiful, smooth, fast-paced, charming, this game has it all. If there was an over-world it would rival Ocarina of Time, the combat system is very similar and in many ways an improvement, the art style is both macabre and manic, like you would expect a sequance of dreams to be, Alice contols satisfyingly and her varied abilities make her seem strangely both helpless and empowered. My only quip is that the game feels the need to remind you every 5 minutes how to play it... but atleast theres no Omochao with an obnoxious voice or any of that.			"

												Well, I was a fan of American McGee's orginal ""Alice"" game and as much as I really, really want to give this a ""thumbs up"", I can't.  I mean, there is a lot to like here.PROS:- They've created a Wonderland that's beautiful, twisted, creepy, dark, and wonderful.- The story (or at least the part I made it through) seemed very interesting.- Platforming elements are challenging enough to be fun, but not to the point of being frustrating.  Alice's ""twist"" and ""float"" are neat.- Hidden stuff to find.  Yay.- Alice's ""shrink"" adds some fun elements to the game.- Great soundtrack.MEH:- Combat is a bit clunky, but it's do-able.CONS:- If I remember correctly, this game didn't used to have an EA registration.  In any event, EA has now added a thoroughly annoying and pointless required registration (of course, right?)- But here's the real deal-breaker, folks: The game is FREAKIN' BROKEN!  Once you get the umbrella, you realize that it's required to defeat the enemy that immediately follows.  And the umbrella is busted; I can't equip or use it.  And, of course, using the umbrella seems to be the only way to defeat that enemy.  And without defeating that enemy, there is no way to move on in the game.  Nice.Apparently, there is some fix available that requires the player to re-write part of the config.  Seriously...what a pain in the @$$.  Anyway, this whole mess essentially ruined the game for me.  And it seems I'm not the only player to encouter this glitch.  Buyer beware!Needless to say, I'm über-bummed with the mess this game turned out to be.  I was really looking forward to enjoying this one.  :(			"

I never played any of the other ones (  even if there is another one  lol )  I've been hesitant in buying this game for some time... because of the mixed reviews :( But i really  really love Alice in Wonderland an decided  why not :D The thing is tho people  saying "" Ohhh you can't really play  this game with out a controller ' <--- That's  wrong. .. I have no problem playing. It does take some getting used to but for me? Was easy granted i am a gamer girl and prolly used to that style of play but believe me  you'll get used to it as well...  It's all   "" Trial and Error "" But over all it's a beautiful game  with so much detail I really can't wait to play more!! GETTTTTTT IT!! ♥ You won't be Disappointed ♥ 10/10			"

												The game is very good, but the mouse acceleration is ATROCIOUS, it's hardcoded into the game and there's no way to disable it. You can always use a xbox controller, but it still can't rival a raw-input mouse and the camera movement is slow as ♥♥♥♥ with it.Apart from that the game is glorious, specially if you like lovecraft and really weird♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

A twisted journey through the mind of a disturbed AliceBeautiful platformer with decent mechanics and relaxing gameplay.-----✓ Great visuals and PhysX integration✓ Levels are decently long✓ Gorgeous outfits in every level✓ Varied gameplay, it's more than just a plain platformer✓ Delightful voice acting/cutscenes✓ Upgradeable weapons✓ A wide variety of difficulty modes✗ NO ACHIEVEMENTS!✗ REQUIRES EA/ORIGIN ACCOUNT FOR ACTIVATION!✗ Plenty of potato textures, poor graphic settings✗ Full of invisible walls✗ Even if you're using a controller, the game will keep showing mouse+keyboard commands✗ Although fun to find, collectibles feel kinda pointless✗ Capped at 30fps (see how to uncap below)✗ Nightmare difficulty is a disappointment (see detailed explanation below)-----Personal thoughtsIf you're looking for a relaxing platformer game with third-person-shooter and hack-and-slash elements, don't think twice and get it. However, keep in mind that it has no achievements, which (in my opinion) takes away the sense of self-improvement for completionists. So you found all the memories/bottles, upgraded all the weapons and finished the game in nightmare difficulty? That's cute and all but it won't be engraved in your profile. Ever.Looking for a challenge? Think twice, because Alice: Madness Returns might not be for you. Why? Because Nightmare difficulty is a disappointment (and boy am I gonna get thumbed down for saying this). It won't spawn more enemies, it won't give them more HP, puzzles won't be harder... and it won't take away the constant hand-holding factor in the game (clues everywhere and the Cheshire cat appearing out of nowhere, telling you exactly what to do). Originally posted by you:		Well, what the hell does Nightmare difficulty change then?	The damage you take from enemies.That's it.That's all it does.And given that there are no achievements, you're better off enjoying yourself, playing in whichever difficulty suits you best and finishing the game in a 100% solitary experience. However, if you can see past these major flaws, the game is quite an enjoyable experience that I'd recommend to anyone.Noteworthy In order to get rid of the peasantry in this game, go to ""Documents\My Games\Alice Madness Returns\AliceGame\Config"", open AliceEngine.ini, find ""MaxSmoothedFrameRate=31"" and change the 31 to your monitor's refresh rate (60, 120, 144, etc.) Best played with a controller "

												This game is great. It definitely gets overly long-winded at points to the point of casually enraging its player. However, the pay-off, especially in the last few chapters, is worth it. I would further go on to recommend playing with a gamepad. There isn't a lot of aiming as far as combat goes and the precision needed to succeed at this game in terms of movement is high. Get this game! :)			"

												tl;dr Great atmosphere, good story, average gameplay. Good for a playthrough. Pick it up when it's on sale next.By far, the most striking thing about the game is its art and atmosphere. Everything feels as off-kilter as a Wonderland run through a trauma filter should, from the dodo-powered machinery of the Hatter's hijacked tea factory to the utterly peaceful, yet utterly terrifying heights of Cardbridge. Each world is absolutely engrossing and sprinkled with details, making you wonder just what strange, horrible wonder is waiting around the corner. The music is suitably downbeat and chilling, picking up with heavy drums during combat, while the occasional string piece brings it all together with Victorian Gothic flair. The character designs are wonderfully macabre, with many returning characters receiving updated designs as befitting of Alice's vastly altered mindscape, and the voice acting is strong. Of particular note is Alice's ever-changing wardrobe; each dress aptly reflects the environment she is exploring, and each appears to have been designed with great care. Each dress also gains a unique gameplay modifier on a second playthrough, such as the Steamdress rewarding more Teeth (used to upgrade weapons) and Roses (the resident health item) from breakables or the Royal Suit limiting the health bar to four Roses.The story itself is similarly strong, albeit flawed towards the end. About a year after Alice's release from Rutledge Asylum at the end of the first game, Alice has found herself under the care of one Dr. Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist helping her to forget her past trauma. However, all is not quite right in Wonderland as once thought, and she finds her world being besieged by the Infernal Train and the Ruin, monsters of oil and machinery. She must return to her once-again fractured world to find the source of the corruption, unravel the mystery of this new madness and save her mind once more. The trickle of clues throughout the levels strings the player along fairly nicely, however it feels as though a few too many important details are left as collectible memories rather than presented at key points in the story. My primary gripe with the plot, however, comes in the last two or so hours of the game. Quite a few sudden revelations happen all at once, especially during two key segments towards the end, and coupled with the fact that some of the clues leading to these revelations are, as mentioned before, left as collectibles that could be easily passed over, the reveals felt jarring.Now for the game's primary issue: the gameplay itself. Now, the game isn't bad by any means. The platforming feels quite smooth, though at times shoddy camera angles can make some jumps harder than they would normally be. Largely, however, this is offset by the fairly generous and forgiving nature of the jump and glide abilities. Combat is relatively simple, with four primary weapons to choose from: the fast-but-weak Vorpal Blade and Pepper Grinder and the slow-but-strong Hobby Horse and Teapot Cannon. While fights can be a smidge on the easy side at times, stringing various combos with the different weapons, or landing a deflecting block with the Umbrella, is satisfying.  As a little personal plus, I liked that you couldn't acidentally dodge roll off of platforms; given the size of some of the platforms you fight on and how far you dodge, it would've been all too easy to launch yourself into the abyss if you could. However, the gameplay is repetitive, repetitive, REPETITIVE. I'll admit, on my first playthrough, I really didn't notice it all that much; the atmosphere and plot were plenty engaging enough and I was so interested to see what was coming next that I really didn't pay it much mind. It wasn't until my second playthrough for a stream, and particularly it wasn't until I reached Tundraful and Deluded Depths, that I started to recognize the patterns of the levels: Platforming segment, pull some levers, a Shrink Sense here and a Clockwork Bomb there, combat, repeat. Occasionally, there are mini-games found in the different chapters, but some (the Off with her Head game, especially) become incredibly tedious. While there are hidden collectibles and Radula Rooms (challenges) to be found just slightly off the beaten path, they don't do much to break up the feeling of linearity. The Deluded Depths and Dollhouse levels, in particular, feel as though they drag on for days.My biggest issue with the game, though, is that you can see just how much more American McGee and Spicy Horse wanted to do with the game. Missed opportunities are EVERYWHERE, with the most egregious being the lack of boss battles. Each chapter has perfect setups for end bosses, but in the end, they all quickly get handwaved away and you're shuffled off to the next bridging London segment with no real payoff. A lot of features found in the beta trailer, like the expanded London segments and the ability to swim through the Deluded Depths, would've been more than welcome, the London segments especially; London would've felt more like a proper setting in its own right than as simply a bridge between Wonderland visits.In the end, though, I can't say I didn't have fun with the game, and its art and atmosphere are truly wonderful to experience. It's a shame that the gameplay doesn't quite reach the same quality, but it's by no means a bad game; it's just not really one you'll want to play through more than once. If you're looking for an aesthetically-rich world and don't mind the gameplay being just alright, give it a look.			"

												Alice Madness Returns caught my attention due to its graphical style. After playing through about half of the game, collecting as many secrets and collectibles as I can find, I have an opinion on the game as a whole.As I said, I love the visuals, the models still look great and the scenery is timeless. Not every part of the game is equally gorgeous though. After completing a part of the game, the game puts you in an underwater environment. The visual appeal of this part is underwhelming when compared to the part you just completed. Another thing that bothered me about that part is that the physics didn't change at all while underwater. But even if this all felt unnatural and a bit underwhelming, parts of the level still got me interested. The next level I was dropped into was equally awesome as the first.The story and the unique and interesting characters really add a lot to the experience. Every character in the game is memorable in some way. Even the enemies have a memorable look. They're not that hard to kill most of the time, but can provide quite the challenge when attacking in groups and do require you to be fast with the controls. The biggest challenges lie in the side missions though, so you don't have to face enormous hordes of monsters when playing through the main game.After all this positivity, we need to talk a bit about the negatives, as there are quite a few.Some parts of the game feel a bit rushed. Enemies placed in awkward spots that render parts of their behavior useless (example: an enemy that can only be defeated by returning it's ranged attacks is placed in a spot where he's not capable of firing shots). This can get really frustrating. The fact that if you die from damage, you have to redo a part of the game doesn't help either. The game also suffers heavily from random crashes through all of the game. One moment it works smooth, the other it closes down without any clear reason. The controls are sometimes fiddly as well, but this does not pose a major issue.To make it run smoothly, you need to apply some tweaks, such as unlocking the framerate and fixing a bug with the umbrella.After all, Alice Madness Returns brings a compelling adventure that still holds up to today's standards in it's genre. It's well worth it's somewhat high price. The collectibles really add to the game as well. They're fun to collect and provide a nice bit of extra story. I would recommend this game to people who like games like Rayman, 3D Mario games and old platformers alike.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a rather unique beast of a game. I never found the jumping and fighting incredibly fun (Although it can be a little fun sometimes), the keyboard and mouse controls stink, the game has some optimization issues, sometimes the jumping is wonky as well as the game having frequent loading times. On top of that, the game runs at 30 fps unless you hop into the config files and change some stuff, which is a bit bothersome.Despite these issues, it's still one of my favorite games I've played in a long time. The story, the view on Alice's mental state, and the presentation of this game make it all worth the trouble. Wonderland is a broken mess, and so is Alice in a lot of ways. Wonderland is falling apart and a destructive force is barrelling through the land, tearing everything apart and threatening to destroy Alice mentally. Meanwhile in Victorian London, Alice struggles with finding answers to her family's death in a fatal fire. Frequently, Alice slips between London and Wonderland, switching between trying to find answers from people she knows, and looking within her memories, respectively.Weaved through all of these events is an odd mix of disturbing and beautiful environments that you'll be jumping through and fighting all sorts of nasty beasties in in your search for the truth. As the game goes on the environments become more gruesome, further signifying the slippery slope into madness.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys an interesting story and more interesting art. The platforming is alright, the combat is sometimes pretty fun, and the aesthetic is incredible. Just remember to look up how to unlock the framerate and use a controller.			"

												Someone once said this game forced them to play it until endgame, I still don't understand that because it was hella easy to beat. I think he was just being a big baby. Combat is relatively simple, alright story, gorgeous atmosphere, and while you can see throw the seams of the worldspace it still looks alright. Replay value is eh, the collectibles don't do much except unlock concept art and backstory which I enjoyed anyway. Bizarrely, whenever you go into menus the framerate just eats♥♥♥♥♥♥and skips, I still don't understand why that happens.I would wait until it goes on sale to get it; this game has EA's seal of approval on it so there are a handful of bugs and glitches which will sometimes hinder progression, but it's no biggie really.Fun short experience honestly.Strong 7 to a light 8 out of 10			"

												This game is truly magnificent, but a bit of a pain to control through PC. I've played this game through PS3 before purchasing it on Steam and it was really easy to play through it, even on Nightmare Mode. It's much more difficult to control on PC for some reason, which makes it a bit irritating.This game isn't one for challenges, but if you enjoy a great storyline and beautiful graphics, then I definitely recommend you get this game.There are a few setbacks though in order to play this game. First off, you need to have an Origin account in order to play this game (because of EA). I myself had no problem logging in since I had an account previously, though many others claim to have issues registering. Not sure how they solved that, but it's worked for me and another friend of mine who has with this game. It also asks you for a product key, which Steam provides you, and that part is easy as well though it's something else people also complain about not working. Hopefully when you buy this game, you don't get these issues.There are many bugs that exist in this game. I had to replay the first chapter a few times simply because the umbrella wasn't working when I needed it to and certain events weren't being triggered after completing a few tasks in order to move on. I found that this was actually because I had changed the settings for the DLCs manually that it began gltiching up very badly. So it's kinda impossible to actually have those DLC Dresses and Weapons unless you want to have a very glitchy game and trust me that ain't fun. Unfortunately Steam doesn't sell the DLCs anymore, so buying them is not possible either.The option for playing the original Alice game doesn't work since the game isn't installed into your computer. Even with the game installed (and I checked since I have the original one installed), the option won't work. It was also part of the DLC package with the dresses and weapons, but also unfortunately is not available.Also, make sure you have a decent graphics card. I myself have an AMD Radeon Graphics card which plays Bioshock Infinite beautifully with no lag, but with this game I sometimes get a slight lag, though it doesn't happen very often. Even though this game is older than Infinite, it tends to lag slightly because of all the beautiful graphics and such since it's heavily concentrated on that.Besides all of those things, it really is a beautiful game. If anything, I recommend getting it for console rather than PC, but if this is your only option then by all means I encourage you to buy this game. It may be irritating since the camera is iffy and it's hard to manuever around, but it's beautiful and a great story to experience.			"

												Alice Madness Returns, whilst being quite derivative in it's gameplay, counteracts much of it's unoriginality in that department, by presenting us with a disturbingly delightful rendition of Wonderland, and of Victorian England. If you're looking a for a game with unique visuals and solid if derivative gameplay, Alice Madness Returns might just be for you.Alice Madness Returns is technically a sequel, though it makes few allusion to the previous game, and really, just knowing of the original Alice in Wonderland story should provide enough background for what happens in Madness Returns, and in case you're still lost, there is an in game ""Previous on Alice"" writeup, which explains this version of Alice's history. It is , all in all, perhaps the most disturbing rendition of Alice, though it still feels more faithful in tone than the most recent Disney adaptation. In Madness Returns, you follow Alice Liddell, who, after being released from Rutledge Asylum, is sent to Dr Bumby's therapy sessions, whereafter she starts relapsing into her fantasy of Wonderland, though apparently things are awry. Alice must find out what is happening and stop Wonderland from falling to pieces, for bother her and Wonderland's sake. While the themes of madness and insanity is briefly touched upon (and when it is, it is at its best, from a narrative standpoint), the overarching story, and the conclusion kind of come out of the left field, with little foreshadowing, or any real reason to be (other than, for the ""Oh Twist"" moment). For the most part the story sort of serves as a push to the next level, and it never quite reaches the depth or complexity that you kind of expect it to. In the end the story, while disappointing, is still serviceable.Gameplay in Madness Returns, while not it's strongest suit, is still surprisingly solid. Its a third person action hack and slash platformer, with platforming and hacking and slashing being distinctive segments of gameplay. Platforming is actually quite fun, with Alice being able to jump a total of four times in the air, and still glide for a distance. She can also shrink, allowing you to find secrets and solve puzzles, and also put down a clockwork bomb to destroy barriers blocking her way, overall giving quite a variety in movement and options in exploration, allowing for some interesting design. Combat is another beast entirely. There are four weapons in the game: The Vorpal Blade - a fast, but light attack, The Hobby Horse - A heavy but slow attack, The Pepper Grinder - A machine gun of sorts which does little damage per shot but fires quite quickly, and The Teapot Cannon, which is a slow but powerful ranged artillery shot. The weapons are almost never not used, as each different enemy might require a different sort of attack, such as large Hulking Ruins being able to block the fast attacks from the pepper grinder and vorpal blade, but can still be hit by the hobby horse and the teapot cannon. Combat generally is quite fun and varied, and some different sections are thrown in to keep it fresh from level to level.Where the game really excels is it's absolutely brilliant artistic design. The game has some of the most imaginative landscapes, that are both beautiful, and sometimes extremely macabre and disturbing. While it graphically might not be the most impressive ( at least not technically), it's still one of the most creative, artistically stunning imagery seen in a video game, and sometimes you want to keep playing just to enjoy more of the surreal landscapes of Wonderland. Even the grim depressing reality of Victorian England is unique, with caricatured exaggerations of many of the characters, is still unique and offer a great contrast with Wonderland.Ultimately, Madness Returns is a aesthetic treat, and while the story has interesting ideas, and the gameplay is derivative, both aspects are solid enough to recommend this game.

												Wow, took me by suprise. I've had this game for almost three years and just got around to playing it, very dissapointed I waited so long! I have to say this game has possibly the best and most enchanting atmosphere of any game I've ever played. And that's awesome, because the atmosphere of Charles Dodgsons Wonderland has been completely Tim Burton-ized. The gameplay can be REALLY repetitive sometimes, but it managed to keep me hooked through the 12 hours it took me to beat the campaign! Shout out to Waanchor for getting me to play it! :)			"

												Get this game and play it!Great artwork, superb story and awesome gameplay.As the player venture in the destruction of her wonderland, the art theme changes according to what happened in Alice's memory. Each chapter represents her delusion, imagination and her reality, and what seems like a halucination for her is just another treat for the players to discover. I never felt like I needed to rush because the art, music and platforming was very enjoyable and entertaining. If you're interested in trying it, google ""ultimate tweak guide"" for this game to get 60fps and to manage your physx and graphics. While this game is respectfully good, it was not a very good port from console so if you want to have a full experience of the game just try fix the .ini files, it would only take about 5 mins or so.

												tl;dr Great atmosphere, good story, average gameplay. Good for a playthrough. Pick it up when it's on sale next.By far, the most striking thing about the game is its art and atmosphere. Everything feels as off-kilter as a Wonderland run through a trauma filter should, from the dodo-powered machinery of the Hatter's hijacked tea factory to the utterly peaceful, yet utterly terrifying heights of Cardbridge. Each world is absolutely engrossing and sprinkled with details, making you wonder just what strange, horrible wonder is waiting around the corner. The music is suitably downbeat and chilling, picking up with heavy drums during combat, while the occasional string piece brings it all together with Victorian Gothic flair. The character designs are wonderfully macabre, with many returning characters receiving updated designs as befitting of Alice's vastly altered mindscape, and the voice acting is strong. Of particular note is Alice's ever-changing wardrobe; each dress aptly reflects the environment she is exploring, and each appears to have been designed with great care. Each dress also gains a unique gameplay modifier on a second playthrough, such as the Steamdress rewarding more Teeth (used to upgrade weapons) and Roses (the resident health item) from breakables or the Royal Suit limiting the health bar to four Roses.The story itself is similarly strong, albeit flawed towards the end. About a year after Alice's release from Rutledge Asylum at the end of the first game, Alice has found herself under the care of one Dr. Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist helping her to forget her past trauma. However, all is not quite right in Wonderland as once thought, and she finds her world being besieged by the Infernal Train and the Ruin, monsters of oil and machinery. She must return to her once-again fractured world to find the source of the corruption, unravel the mystery of this new madness and save her mind once more. The trickle of clues throughout the levels strings the player along fairly nicely, however it feels as though a few too many important details are left as collectible memories rather than presented at key points in the story. My primary gripe with the plot, however, comes in the last two or so hours of the game. Quite a few sudden revelations happen all at once, especially during two key segments towards the end, and coupled with the fact that some of the clues leading to these revelations are, as mentioned before, left as collectibles that could be easily passed over, the reveals felt jarring.Now for the game's primary issue: the gameplay itself. Now, the game isn't bad by any means. The platforming feels quite smooth, though at times shoddy camera angles can make some jumps harder than they would normally be. Largely, however, this is offset by the fairly generous and forgiving nature of the jump and glide abilities. Combat is relatively simple, with four primary weapons to choose from: the fast-but-weak Vorpal Blade and Pepper Grinder and the slow-but-strong Hobby Horse and Teapot Cannon. While fights can be a smidge on the easy side at times, stringing various combos with the different weapons, or landing a deflecting block with the Umbrella, is satisfying.  As a little personal plus, I liked that you couldn't acidentally dodge roll off of platforms; given the size of some of the platforms you fight on and how far you dodge, it would've been all too easy to launch yourself into the abyss if you could. However, the gameplay is repetitive, repetitive, REPETITIVE. I'll admit, on my first playthrough, I really didn't notice it all that much; the atmosphere and plot were plenty engaging enough and I was so interested to see what was coming next that I really didn't pay it much mind. It wasn't until my second playthrough for a stream, and particularly it wasn't until I reached Tundraful and Deluded Depths, that I started to recognize the patterns of the levels: Platforming segment, pull some levers, a Shrink Sense here and a Clockwork Bomb there, combat, repeat. Occasionally, there are mini-games found in the different chapters, but some (the Off with her Head game, especially) become incredibly tedious. While there are hidden collectibles and Radula Rooms (challenges) to be found just slightly off the beaten path, they don't do much to break up the feeling of linearity. The Deluded Depths and Dollhouse levels, in particular, feel as though they drag on for days.My biggest issue with the game, though, is that you can see just how much more American McGee and Spicy Horse wanted to do with the game. Missed opportunities are EVERYWHERE, with the most egregious being the lack of boss battles. Each chapter has perfect setups for end bosses, but in the end, they all quickly get handwaved away and you're shuffled off to the next bridging London segment with no real payoff. A lot of features found in the beta trailer, like the expanded London segments and the ability to swim through the Deluded Depths, would've been more than welcome, the London segments especially; London would've felt more like a proper setting in its own right than as simply a bridge between Wonderland visits.In the end, though, I can't say I didn't have fun with the game, and its art and atmosphere are truly wonderful to experience. It's a shame that the gameplay doesn't quite reach the same quality, but it's by no means a bad game; it's just not really one you'll want to play through more than once. If you're looking for an aesthetically-rich world and don't mind the gameplay being just alright, give it a look.			"

												Alice Madness Returns caught my attention due to its graphical style. After playing through about half of the game, collecting as many secrets and collectibles as I can find, I have an opinion on the game as a whole.As I said, I love the visuals, the models still look great and the scenery is timeless. Not every part of the game is equally gorgeous though. After completing a part of the game, the game puts you in an underwater environment. The visual appeal of this part is underwhelming when compared to the part you just completed. Another thing that bothered me about that part is that the physics didn't change at all while underwater. But even if this all felt unnatural and a bit underwhelming, parts of the level still got me interested. The next level I was dropped into was equally awesome as the first.The story and the unique and interesting characters really add a lot to the experience. Every character in the game is memorable in some way. Even the enemies have a memorable look. They're not that hard to kill most of the time, but can provide quite the challenge when attacking in groups and do require you to be fast with the controls. The biggest challenges lie in the side missions though, so you don't have to face enormous hordes of monsters when playing through the main game.After all this positivity, we need to talk a bit about the negatives, as there are quite a few.Some parts of the game feel a bit rushed. Enemies placed in awkward spots that render parts of their behavior useless (example: an enemy that can only be defeated by returning it's ranged attacks is placed in a spot where he's not capable of firing shots). This can get really frustrating. The fact that if you die from damage, you have to redo a part of the game doesn't help either. The game also suffers heavily from random crashes through all of the game. One moment it works smooth, the other it closes down without any clear reason. The controls are sometimes fiddly as well, but this does not pose a major issue.To make it run smoothly, you need to apply some tweaks, such as unlocking the framerate and fixing a bug with the umbrella.After all, Alice Madness Returns brings a compelling adventure that still holds up to today's standards in it's genre. It's well worth it's somewhat high price. The collectibles really add to the game as well. They're fun to collect and provide a nice bit of extra story. I would recommend this game to people who like games like Rayman, 3D Mario games and old platformers alike.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a rather unique beast of a game. I never found the jumping and fighting incredibly fun (Although it can be a little fun sometimes), the keyboard and mouse controls stink, the game has some optimization issues, sometimes the jumping is wonky as well as the game having frequent loading times. On top of that, the game runs at 30 fps unless you hop into the config files and change some stuff, which is a bit bothersome.Despite these issues, it's still one of my favorite games I've played in a long time. The story, the view on Alice's mental state, and the presentation of this game make it all worth the trouble. Wonderland is a broken mess, and so is Alice in a lot of ways. Wonderland is falling apart and a destructive force is barrelling through the land, tearing everything apart and threatening to destroy Alice mentally. Meanwhile in Victorian London, Alice struggles with finding answers to her family's death in a fatal fire. Frequently, Alice slips between London and Wonderland, switching between trying to find answers from people she knows, and looking within her memories, respectively.Weaved through all of these events is an odd mix of disturbing and beautiful environments that you'll be jumping through and fighting all sorts of nasty beasties in in your search for the truth. As the game goes on the environments become more gruesome, further signifying the slippery slope into madness.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys an interesting story and more interesting art. The platforming is alright, the combat is sometimes pretty fun, and the aesthetic is incredible. Just remember to look up how to unlock the framerate and use a controller.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns finished on normal. Game itself was a bit buggy and required a couple restarts. Also setting it up there was a resolution problem which was solved with some Googling.  The story was interesting and if you like platforming-puzzle solvers with a little bit of repetitive combat this is pretty good. My number one favorite part of the game was the art. Very dark and disturbing vision of Wonderland. ;)Good: Art, Story, PlatformingOk: Combat, PuzzlesBad: EA Origin account required, Buggy install, Objects and enemies sometimes bug out requing restart.

												Someone once said this game forced them to play it until endgame, I still don't understand that because it was hella easy to beat. I think he was just being a big baby. Combat is relatively simple, alright story, gorgeous atmosphere, and while you can see throw the seams of the worldspace it still looks alright. Replay value is eh, the collectibles don't do much except unlock concept art and backstory which I enjoyed anyway. Bizarrely, whenever you go into menus the framerate just eats♥♥♥♥♥♥and skips, I still don't understand why that happens.I would wait until it goes on sale to get it; this game has EA's seal of approval on it so there are a handful of bugs and glitches which will sometimes hinder progression, but it's no biggie really.Fun short experience honestly.Strong 7 to a light 8 out of 10			"

I have to say this game has possibly the best and most enchanting atmosphere of any game I've ever played. And that's awesome, because the atmosphere of Charles Dodgsons Wonderland has been completely Tim Burton-ized. The gameplay can be REALLY repetitive sometimes, but it managed to keep me hooked through the 12 hours it took me to beat the campaign! Shout out to Waanchor for getting me to play it! :)			"

												Get this game and play it!Great artwork, superb story and awesome gameplay.As the player venture in the destruction of her wonderland, the art theme changes according to what happened in Alice's memory. Each chapter represents her delusion, imagination and her reality, and what seems like a halucination for her is just another treat for the players to discover. I never felt like I needed to rush because the art, music and platforming was very enjoyable and entertaining. If you're interested in trying it, google ""ultimate tweak guide"" for this game to get 60fps and to manage your physx and graphics. While this game is respectfully good, it was not a very good port from console so if you want to have a full experience of the game just try fix the .ini files, it would only take about 5 mins or so.

												Alice:Madness Returns is a terrific if flawed sequel to the original. As a narrative, it picks up the story where it left off in the first game and intelligently brings it to a conclusion. When it's over, you fully understand why Alice was driven to her madness in the first place, a reason much more sinister than simply that her family died in a fire years ago. The story is told wonderfully through excellent voice acting in recovered memories and in sequences cleverly done in cartoon cutouts. Alice also communicates with Cheshire Cat throughout the game in the game's 3D world.Visually, Alice is beautiful and a treat for the eyes. The game uses a wide color palette based on the theme of the area she is in, and the level design and art direction are excellent and sometimes spectacular. London itself is appropriately dark and gritty, all done in greyscale, making the Wonderland segments pop more colorfully than they probably really are. Character models are also appropriately cartoony and slightly twisted. The musical score effectively evokes the mood of the game, though it lacks the disturbing discord that the original's soundtrack evoked.The gameplay itself was mostly very enjoyable. The platforming was clever and challenging, and the combat (which there is a lot of) was very smooth (the ""focus"" or auto-targetting system works wonderfully if used correctly). The game also breaks things up nicely with various themed puzzles and even some sidescrolling mini games that were very fun. While a bit long for a platformer, Alice was nonetheless engaging all the way to the end.There were some negatives that marred the overall experience, some significant. The autosave feature is probably the biggest problem with the game. Since you can't manually save (like in the original Alice), you can only restart from the last checkpoint. The problem is, it is very easy to unwittingly transition out of an area when you still had another path you wanted to explore that might have lead to collectibles or an optional arena fight (to gain HP), and you can't go back since the game only stores one auto save (it does allow you to revisit major checkpoints after you complete a chapter, but you would have to go back and replay several areas to get back to where you want to be). Some of the auto saves are well-placed, but not all, forcing you to redo a jumping sequence for example before you can get back to the mini boss who just beat you. The auto save feature really rears its ugly head in the final boss fight, as it saves at two points during the fight. This sounds convenient on the surface, not having to start the whole long fight over from the beginning if you die. The problem is, you could in theory be down to your last bit of health when it auto saves for the next part of the fight, so now if you die you will always restart from that point at near-death, you can't go back to the begnning. They needed to include two or three auto save slots in the game to avoid this game-breaking scenario.Another issue with the game is the repetitive combat. Too many times in the game must you fight the menacing ruin, for example, which appears in various combinations with other enemies. There are many times in the game where you will run into one and say, ""didn't I just beat this guy?"" A similar experience happens near the end of chapter 2, where you defeat a mini boss called the drowned sailor, only to meet another one on the other side of a gate, then have to go inside three separate buildings to beat three more of them. This kind of gratuitous combat served to needlessly drag out the game and produce too many moments of ""Oh, not again.""The bottle collecting in the game is rendered almost pointless because in order to unlock what I believe is additional concept art, you have to collect every bottle in each chapter. Unfortunately, I was always a couple of bottles short of the dozen or so I needed to find. It would have been nice if they unlocked ""some"" of the content based on what you found, instead of making it all or nothing.Lastly, I found the jumping mechanics to be a little off, making some of the jumping sequences needlessly frustrating. Mainly, Alice would many times drop like a rock on the third jump in a three-jump sequence no matter how dextrously I hit the jump key, and this also happened a lot when hitting the jump key as she was hitting the apex of an air plume or off a jumping mushroom. They needed to fine-tune this, the jumping mechanics should have been much smoother and more forgiving.Overall, though, Alice is a fine sequel and is a must-play if you wre a fan of the original. Even if you aren't, it is a solid platformer and a very unique and original experience.			"

												Really great game! Has a lot of intense combat and fun puzzles. The story is pretty crazy and dark, this is not the Disney Alice by any means. There's actually some pretty scary moments at times too, so it's got a little of everything. My only complaint is some of the parkour and jumping parts can get sort of repetative and frustrating, but it by no means takes away from the great elements of the game. As for the complaintes about setting up an EA account, it took like two minutes and was no trouble for me, so don't let that scare you off.			"

												Long game, can be repetitive – definitely maddening.. worth a go if you like surreal games, with odd enemies and an unusual array or weapons. Controlling the character can be a bit frustrating at times as the camera sometimes fixes itself into strange positions and the keys respond relative to how you view the screen not how Alice moves.. e.g. you have to run down a corridor ""into"" the camera, so S becomes forwards, W back, A/D revert left/right – tricky orientation to play with. Also includes a couple of mini-ingames: side-on and platform games, chess and slider puzzles, and a bowling ball style game which are short but mandatory. Probably best bought during a sale or deal, the full price seems a little on the high side.			"

												Done. *Sigh*… this was hard work. At the end of the day, I liked the game. The artwork is nice and the action-jump-and-run-mix is one of my favorites. I like the adult story, which is wrapped in the “Alice in Wonderland”-theme. But I’ve one big problem with this game … it’s way too long. In my opinion, you can see that the game is purposely stretched, after ca 2,5 hours of gameplay. Unnecessarily long jump-session or the 2128th wave of the same enemies you have to kill, supports this theory. This was the first time I felt slightly bored, but then the designer present you the first feature (like some sort of puzzle, etc.), that you don’t see too often in gaming. Little did I know that this feature was torturing me for over 2 hours, again and again. On the first appearance I thought: “Oh, nice!” but after the 3rd or 4th time I only could think: “OH MY GOD! MAKE IT STOP!”.At this point I was suspicious about every upcoming feature, because it was going to hunt me for hours like the first one. After that, I was not only bored, but also annoyed.Please, don’t misunderstand me! It’s not a bad game and I think it’s really worth playing. The story is very good and contains a big wtf-moment, when everything is explained. But I also think you should know before the purchase, what lies ahead of you.  Sometimes less is more. ;)			"

												Pros: - A delightful aesthetic ranging from the beautiful Vale of Tears, the disgusting streets of London and the horrifically twisted Dollhouse. The game's visuals are imaginative and a joy to behold.- Reliable controls.- A warped, sad story that held my attention.Cons:- Much too long. While the levels are beautiful many of them badly overstay their welcome and leave me exasperated when faced with another twenty minute platforming section.- Combat is easy to master and eventually provides no challenge. Once you know how to defeat even the strongest enemies - even in groups - it's just a matter of crowd control and keeping out of harm's way. Only boss fight is at the very end.Overall: A beautiful but pretty average action platformer. Got it on sale and glad I played through it. Would recommend for the experience but don't expect too much and you might find something to enjoy.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is an adult themed action adventure based on American McGee’s Alice. The graphics are of course dated but it's not insult to the eyes. All 6 chapters have their own theme and alice wears a dress fitting to these themes(excluding in chapter 6). I think they did a great jobe in designing these chapters and the monsters, but there could be more monster or at least some variety in the design.There are two things i really dislike about this game. The first is the voice acting, they hired the wrong voice actor for Alice, she doesn't fit to Alice and she really talks emotionless. BUT i could go over it because the worst thing about this game is the camera, let's just say the camera is 90% of the time not where it suppose to be, correcting it made this game at times a pain.

												Alice In Wonderland by way of Tim Burton and Sam Raimi. You play Alice as her memories return and she has to come to term with what really happened to her family in a house fire and the reasons behind it.Within the grimy Victorian seediness lies a fantastic platformer, and one of my all-time favourites, together with the orginal American McGee's Alice. The platforming is regularly interspersed with some surprisingly frenetic combat.You have five weapons at your disposal: the Vorpal blade which is your standard weapon, the Pepper Grinder (read machine gun), the Teapot (read grenade launcher), and the Hobby Horse which is really a substitute for a Sledgehammer. Also the player can also drop clockwork bombs that either uses a timer, or can be manually detonated. Though the fighting can get frantic at times, it is only ever really difficult if you don't employ some kind of tactics. The bomb, for instance, is essential for distracting enemies and overturning crabs to reveal their weak underbelly.The graphics of this game are gorgeous, but they have an 'ugly beauty' about them, inspired by the East European puppet animations of Jan Svankmeyer and the Brothers Quay. The music of A: MR also has a disturbing charm, as it moves between whimsical piano and grungey industrial ambience.I can really recommend Alice: Madness Returns to any platformer-lover, but with reservations about the adult themes that run through the game. Also, if activated (my Steam version was deactivated by default), the language can be quite mature at times, with the C-word used once or twice.My only gripe with this game, and it's not the only game to be guilty of this, is doors shutting behind the player, thus closing off parts of a level without warning and without the player having fully explored an area. This often means completionists need to replay levels to get pickups they missed. Surely some warning that going through a doorway, or moving into an area, will end the level isn't too much to ask?Apart from that, Alice: Madness Returns is a great old-school platformer with some of the most creatively inspiring environments I've ever seen in a game. Weapons are varied; Fighting frantic but fun; Lots of collectibles; Soundtrack is awesome.Always been a big fan of this game: 9/10.			"

Posted: January 1, 2015
												Alice:Madness Returns is a terrific if flawed sequel to the original. As a narrative, it picks up the story where it left off in the first game and intelligently brings it to a conclusion. When it's over, you fully understand why Alice was driven to her madness in the first place, a reason much more sinister than simply that her family died in a fire years ago. The story is told wonderfully through excellent voice acting in recovered memories and in sequences cleverly done in cartoon cutouts. Alice also communicates with Cheshire Cat throughout the game in the game's 3D world.Visually, Alice is beautiful and a treat for the eyes. The game uses a wide color palette based on the theme of the area she is in, and the level design and art direction are excellent and sometimes spectacular. London itself is appropriately dark and gritty, all done in greyscale, making the Wonderland segments pop more colorfully than they probably really are. Character models are also appropriately cartoony and slightly twisted. The musical score effectively evokes the mood of the game, though it lacks the disturbing discord that the original's soundtrack evoked.The gameplay itself was mostly very enjoyable. The platforming was clever and challenging, and the combat (which there is a lot of) was very smooth (the ""focus"" or auto-targetting system works wonderfully if used correctly). The game also breaks things up nicely with various themed puzzles and even some sidescrolling mini games that were very fun. While a bit long for a platformer, Alice was nonetheless engaging all the way to the end.There were some negatives that marred the overall experience, some significant. The autosave feature is probably the biggest problem with the game. Since you can't manually save (like in the original Alice), you can only restart from the last checkpoint. The problem is, it is very easy to unwittingly transition out of an area when you still had another path you wanted to explore that might have lead to collectibles or an optional arena fight (to gain HP), and you can't go back since the game only stores one auto save (it does allow you to revisit major checkpoints after you complete a chapter, but you would have to go back and replay several areas to get back to where you want to be). Some of the auto saves are well-placed, but not all, forcing you to redo a jumping sequence for example before you can get back to the mini boss who just beat you. The auto save feature really rears its ugly head in the final boss fight, as it saves at two points during the fight. This sounds convenient on the surface, not having to start the whole long fight over from the beginning if you die. The problem is, you could in theory be down to your last bit of health when it auto saves for the next part of the fight, so now if you die you will always restart from that point at near-death, you can't go back to the begnning. They needed to include two or three auto save slots in the game to avoid this game-breaking scenario.Another issue with the game is the repetitive combat. Too many times in the game must you fight the menacing ruin, for example, which appears in various combinations with other enemies. There are many times in the game where you will run into one and say, ""didn't I just beat this guy?"" A similar experience happens near the end of chapter 2, where you defeat a mini boss called the drowned sailor, only to meet another one on the other side of a gate, then have to go inside three separate buildings to beat three more of them. This kind of gratuitous combat served to needlessly drag out the game and produce too many moments of ""Oh, not again.""The bottle collecting in the game is rendered almost pointless because in order to unlock what I believe is additional concept art, you have to collect every bottle in each chapter. Unfortunately, I was always a couple of bottles short of the dozen or so I needed to find. It would have been nice if they unlocked ""some"" of the content based on what you found, instead of making it all or nothing.Lastly, I found the jumping mechanics to be a little off, making some of the jumping sequences needlessly frustrating. Mainly, Alice would many times drop like a rock on the third jump in a three-jump sequence no matter how dextrously I hit the jump key, and this also happened a lot when hitting the jump key as she was hitting the apex of an air plume or off a jumping mushroom. They needed to fine-tune this, the jumping mechanics should have been much smoother and more forgiving.Overall, though, Alice is a fine sequel and is a must-play if you wre a fan of the original. Even if you aren't, it is a solid platformer and a very unique and original experience.			"

												Controls are kinda buggy in comparison to other games (like when I have to reload a stage because Alice decides to run in one direction and ignore my commands) but overall, the controls are much better than the first. The targeting system can get irritating at times but I love that there's not only a dodge feature, but that the game implements it very successsfully. (I dunno, sometimes games introduce a feature that's almost more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to use than to not use.) Graphics are much better than the first (obviously). One may look more or less ""darker"" than the other, but if the first one does look cooler than the second, MR's art is still ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I remember the voice acting being better in the first to a point where MR kinda irritates me. The thing I hate most is that The Hatter was one of the most badass bosses from the first and he's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this one. Hopefully, they'll make up for it if The Jabberwocky is a boss later on...			"

												Really great game! Has a lot of intense combat and fun puzzles. The story is pretty crazy and dark, this is not the Disney Alice by any means. There's actually some pretty scary moments at times too, so it's got a little of everything. My only complaint is some of the parkour and jumping parts can get sort of repetative and frustrating, but it by no means takes away from the great elements of the game. As for the complaintes about setting up an EA account, it took like two minutes and was no trouble for me, so don't let that scare you off.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a 3D on-rails platformer with horror elements that tells the story of Alice Liddell - a teenaged girl who's suffering from trauma caused by the death of her family in a fire. The player's role is to guide her through the Wonderland, which represents different parts of her mind, to recover her lost memory and find the source of corruption that's been ruining it.In terms of graphics, I wouldn't compliment their general quality as the models and textures aren't top notch, but the general design is splendid. The locations are beautifully done, dark and moody, which creates an incredible effect when combined with the game's psychodelic music. It all creates a borderline horror-like climate throughout most of the game. The imagery may not be as disturbing as for example Yume Nikki, but comes quite close.In terms of gameplay, the player has quite a bit of movement options in his hands, and even more when it comes to combat. Alice can quadrupple jump and float, making her one of the more nimble characters in the history of platformers. She also gets an assortment of different (upgradeable) weapons that she can use to battle the quite diverse library of foes she will encounter, as well as a dodge move which is basically a flash step. She can also lock-on to her enemies and aim automatically. This all makes the combat very satisfying and when you lose, it's usually your own fault, not the control's. For those who feel hardcore enough, there is the Nightmare difficulty which vastly bumps up the strength of enemies, and certain dresses Alice can wear albo make the game harder (like limiting her health). Of course, you can also opt for a low difficulty, if you're a casual gamer. Pretty much the only bad thing is the fact that the final boss is kind of easy in comparison to the rest of the game on any given difficulty.One last thing to say is that this game is not for kids. More thanks to disturbing imagery than anything, really.Overall, this game is a great platformer, with moody, psychodelic environments and very good combat system. I recommend it to both casual players and hardcore on-rails platformer fans.			"

												Long game, can be repetitive – definitely maddening.. worth a go if you like surreal games, with odd enemies and an unusual array or weapons. Controlling the character can be a bit frustrating at times as the camera sometimes fixes itself into strange positions and the keys respond relative to how you view the screen not how Alice moves.. e.g. you have to run down a corridor ""into"" the camera, so S becomes forwards, W back, A/D revert left/right – tricky orientation to play with. Also includes a couple of mini-ingames: side-on and platform games, chess and slider puzzles, and a bowling ball style game which are short but mandatory. Probably best bought during a sale or deal, the full price seems a little on the high side.			"

												8/10 Its a cute game. The game in itself is as creepy as hell, but the gameplay makes up for that by being incredibly nostalgic. Control's work great-they are very fluent and very fun! The game dosent have the most engaging plot, but it fits the setting and it is good to the point where you want to keep playing. Alice Madness Returns also has a high replay value, because as i've said- this game has fun nostalgic gameplay. It is a really great game- if this game currently isnt in your collection- I would reccomend buying it.			"

												Hello close friends and strangers of the interwebs.I recently picked up Alice: Madness Returns in a steam sale (Hell, I'll buy anything for $5) and finished it 23 seconds ago.I felt like I had to write a review for this game because frankly, IT'S THE BEST THING I'VE EVER PLAYED!The first thing that struck me getting into the game was the art style. It was simply amazing how bleak and uninteresting everything in reality looked and it's contrast with wonderland, which toyed with my own sanity. as close to everything tested the limits of my own comprehension abilities. I have to say, despite it's 2011 graphics, the style of art managed to almost blow me away with the occasional cutscène being artfully displayed as a puppet show portraying Alice's family's fiery death (charming, I know) Now, after dedicating a paragraph alone to the art style, it's probably time to talk about something else. The storyline simply stunned me, making me unsure of what was real, what was relevant and what was a hallucination which kept me guessing until the very end where it made it blatantly clear that how many memories I failed to collect. With re-imagined, corrupted characters from a franchise which was a part of my childhood kept me interested as this game hacked at my innocence with a rusty axe, this game kept me enthralled for it's entirety.Probably about time to talk about some gameplay. Now, whilst my heart belongs to open world games, I was surprised how much I enjoyed the lack of control I had over which missions my protagonist completed and it what order. It almost added to the sense of complete madness that was magnified by all aspects of this game. As for the level design, it almost felt like there were two parts to this game. The puzzle-platforming segment, which had Alice bouncing from mushroom to invisible platform to pressure pad, and the fighting segment, which had a interesting system of locking onto specific enemies and defeating them using different combinations of light and heavy melee attacks and ranged attacks which include a giant teapot-grenade launcher and a minigun that gives an entirely different definition to peppering your enemies (ADUHDUHDUH). Whilst the combat was comprised of simply mechanics, the creative enemies meant that you always had to be trying different things instead of spamming certain attacks.Alright guys, I'm freaking tired of the emotional rollercoaster that this game provided me, i think it's time I wrapped this up. In conclusion (If you were going to read any of this review, this would be the part)Art style: SensationalStoryline: SensationalGameplay: Sensational10/10 Would recommend.Thanks for reading, I'm George, and I'll see you next time.

												Great game but very disappointing ending... They build up a story that deserved a way better ending... Oh well, in my opinion it's not worth the 7€ I payed for it...   There are a lot of bugs in the controls if you are using a mouse and keyboard. Most of the times dodging is absolutely random: it doesn't matter what direction your trying to go. Jumping? omg... At the beginning of the game it works fine, but when you get to around chapters 3 or 4 it gets crazy! Jumping on steam is bugged a lot making you unable to go higher and most of the time when you try to jump out of it you will automatically be gliding, which makes you unable to jump higher with the extra jumps you get. The targeting system is really obnoxious and frustrating, I found myself using it only in extreme cases.The mini games are cool once or twice but they become boring and repetitive easily. I don't want to spoil anyone, so I will not go into details, but if you're like me and like to search for hidden secrets you will encounter a bunch of them. Another complaint I've got is the lack of configuration, especially video options. For some reason I would experience random freezes that lasted a few milliseconds but long enough to screw a timed run or jumping puzzle. It's possible the problem is with my computer, but still... If the game had a better settings menu, you could lower some video settings enough and possibly make it run smoothly. Again, loved the story except for the ending. The atmosphere is brilliant and really makes you believe you are in Wonderland. Beautiful scenery and sounds. I was immersed in all that was going on (except when I was having trouble with the damn controls). There are plenty of hidden secrets to find and in my 17h of gameplay I did NOT find all of them, mainly because I was getting frustrated with the controls during the last chapters. Still, my save file is at 94% completion.  Overall I would give it a 7/10, I really wanted to give it an 8, but due to the problems I had during the last chapters I can't give it more than a 7. This is my opinion and mine alone, if you disagree and didn't experience the same problems I did, I'm glad for you and I hope others won't.			"

												Alice Madness Returns is a perfect sequel in every way to the original American Mcgee tale. Everything from the music to the combat has been greatly improved. The only real complaint I have is that the combat gets sorta redundant, but that's to be expected. It's pretty much darksiders but with Alice and wonderland instead.			"

												Had some trouble registering the game at first.  Ended up logging into origin to register the product with my product key from steam but after that it starts though steam every time.  The game itself if a fairly fun platformer with some interesting combat mechanics.  The environments and art direction really shine in this game but the music is very dull and repeditive.  Game mechanics do get repeditive after a little bit and the puzzles are a easy to overcome and require little though.  I did enjoy the combat and seeing all the different environments the most.  Overall I would recommend this game as a steam sale purchase if you are looking for a adventure platforming game. Pros-Art designCombat is smoothenvironment is gorgeouslooks just as good as many modern gamesCons -EA product registrationrepetition platforming elementseasy puzzlesseems like the game was a bit rushed			"

												I bought this game because I loved the American McGee's, Alice, that came out in 2000, so of course it was only natural that I purchase Alice: Madness Returns. It is the similar fantastic psychological horror. action-adventure, third person video game as the first one, however, you do not need to play the first one in order to enjoy this game as it isnt a direct sequal. It's extremely imaginative, unique and fun! You will enjoy a slew of great costume changes and a selection of crazy weapons you obtain as you advance throughout the game. Although I'd reccomend this game to anyone, I feel the story lacks the complexity I'd hope for from a psychological horror. Also, the ideas and theme of the game is extremely close to the 2000 version, and I was kind of looking for a new spin on things. 8/10.			"

												At the moment I'm 5 hours in and it's still enjoyable. The story is very weird and twisted which is really entertaining and you want to know more. There are however some things that annoys me and I'll make a pro/con list below:Pro+Story is fun to followCombat is enjoyable and satisfyingUpgrades available for weaponsGraphics are decent and the art style is weird, in a good wayCon-Bad cameraTarget system flips out when multiple targets are nearbyInvisable walls blocks main path in some areas, a minor annoyance since you can just jump over themPlaying on PC with a controller still only shows PC keybinds on tutorialsI have yet to encounter a big bossOverall I still think this game is worth playing, especially if you buy it now on Steam Summer Sale for 5€.

												Alice: Madness Returns... My favourite game since its prequel, American Mcgee's Alice, Which by the way, isn't on Steam OR Origin. I tried finding it...It's one hell of a beautiful game, I must say. The visuals are meant to be taken as metaphors most of the time, so to those who don't like things like that... This game won't be your cup of Tea. It will be a really weird game to you.The game DOES have peculiarities and it's just how it's meant to be. I like the story. Alice is one hell of a role model. Except the brutality in Wonderland part. She's a character that I could describe as one of the most humane characters in the whole gaming industry. She's smart, but not strong or too fragile, she's not some kind of an all-knowing person. She has her fears, doubts, strengths, weaknesses. She's a beliavable character.I know the game has its plot holes, but so does nearly every game EVER.Now, gameplay-wise, I would advise anyone who has a PC-compatible controller to try and play it. It feels way smoother that way. I'm not saying the PC controls don't work or anything(Which has happened to me sometimes), but the game is smoother when played with a controller.There are some sections of this game that should have ended sooner. They felt dragged out and I know they would be. That's what you get when you work with EA in the first place. There is no way to get rid of tutorials even after you have completed the game, so it will remind you again and again about some stuff.Overall, the game has its flaws, but it still stands up strong. DEFINITELY recommended.EDIT: Forgot to mention that the music is very appropriate in most cases, but it's just not as memorable as the one from American Mcgee's Alice.			"

												Lets get this out of the way with first. I love this concept. Super dark Alice In Wonderland who turns out to be literally insane; yes, just yes. While the concept is superb, the gameplay and story is different. I'd say it's rather boring to play and pay attention to after 3 hours. This game plays like a normal 'hack n' slash', just lacking a variety of combat related moves and combinations. While I came across many different items and upgrades throughout the story, it still always felt I was repeating myself a lot. Not to mention, the enemies feel awkward to attack at times, often feeling like they aren't living beings, repeating the same animation over and over again, not responding differently to different attacks. While the story is rather interesting to begin with, with Alice describing her urge to go insane, I still have to say the story seems quiet. By this I mean; dialogue seems forced, but not important at the same time. Whenever the Cheshire Cat talks, his dialogue just doesn't fit in with the situation. The same could be said with other characters in hub areas.There isn't much to say about this game. I wanted to like playing it, but there's just a lot missing. It feels unfinished. While the graphics are nice, with vibrant colours and varying environments, I just can't say I enjoy exploring the world either. The adventure is missing soul, meaning and likable important characters. Certainly give this a go when it's cheap, but I can't say for sure you'll love it.			"

Pretty interesting to see her story unravel, even though it was pretty predicable. The mini games and puzzles were either annoying, fantastic, or repetitive depending on your likes and what not. Also loved how the 1st official boss battle was also one of the easiest enemy encounters in the game lol.

												I don't know what to say. Let me compare the pros and cons of this game.PROS+ The story is INCREDIBLE. It's mind-blowing, very complex, and it really affects you. It's not for the faint of the heart, mind you. On the outside, it looks like a fairy tale, but inside, there's corruption and vice of every kind.+ The artwork for this game is out of this world. I really wonder whether the people in Spicy Horse studio are sane people. This is definitely the most pscyhopatic game I've ever seen.+ The weapons are awesome. A teapot cannon to scold enemies? Cool!+ The gameplay has some really crazy moments. You shoot disembodied snouts with pepper grinder, which makes them sneeze secrets and bonuses. Need I say more?+ The soundtrack is amazing. The main menu theme is simply a masterpiece.CONS- Except the first, fourth and last chapter, the game is extremely boring. Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 is so boring, I almost literally fell asleep. - The game is too long. Sometimes you really feel like the developers just ran out of ideas and randomly inserted platform puzzles here and there.- The game micro-stutters and sometimes freezes, but this may be hardware-related, I'm not sure.In summary, this game has an incredible potential, which is wasted by very poor and extremely boring gameplay. I suggest this game ONLY if you have too much time in your hands.			"

												Kinda got repetitive near the end but wasn't bad. Wouldn't pay more than 20 dollars for it but I don't think I did.I also the sequel for this game (Otherlands) was extremely poorly animated. Sure this game had meh voice acting but i'm not sure how they could go from this then 200k+ on kickstarter and make the trash they did with Otherlands.Another problem with this iteration of Alice and McGees Alice Trilogy in general is that it still basically all boils down to ""none of its real and its all in your mind"" which is kind of trash especially considering the original books were literally about a world underground not some fake world in her mind.

The emotion felt through this game is quite twisted, charming, and scary at times. The story will explain itself as it goes on. + Good graphics and art, it can be beautiful, charming and twisted at times.+ That Hair phyics, you gotta give them props for that+ The story is amazingly cool in this game+ Lots of cool costumes to wear from but wait, read the bottom+ Challenging and interesting bosses+ The powers in this game is quite unique- The controls and camera can get time to get use to, because its quite frankly, bad lol- Alot of those costumes you can only find from origin =(, if you really want them you can go there but damn!- Want a multiplayer, who wouldn't want to stab other people as alice? in this twisted world, i wish it was true. maybe a Tf2 type of gameplay using the twisted characters of this game.

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 70% YES / 30% NOGOODGreat art direction and variety of environments.Plenty of beautiful costume changes as you change between the environments.Monster designs are super on point per environment and mesh well with telling me a story with each new chapter.Combat feels great. Nice weight to Alice, the main weapon the Vorpal Blade feels fun, and the dashing is almost instantly understood on when you can and cannot use it.There is a perfect amount of usable weapons in the game. Just enough to collect, upgrade, and focus on without getting swamped in indecision.There is a healthy amount of collectibles if you're so apt for them. I still nabbed the ones I ran by, but I never felt pressured to get them all.NEUTRALMost voice acting is ok, but Alice's feels too one note. Regardless of the line or scene, it will be delivered straight and with barely any emotion. This works for the cheshire cat but not so much Alice.The story is ok, but I stopped paying attention after awhile. Mostly some talk about madness and Alice's mental health, but sometimes an entire game based on inane ravings of everyone 24/7 will make your eyes glaze over.Surprisingly only one boss in the game, at the end, where I would have loved to see some end chapter bosses given how good the gameplay is.BADThe activation process for this game is way too sloppy. FYI: to activate this product, you'll need to download the Origin client and enter the product key there. Not the EA launcher when launching this game for the first time.Can die during in game cut scenes.Lots of hitching throughout the game that, again, has been the cause of a death or two.There are a LOT of mini games in here and most of them are awful. Some are ok like the sliding segments or the baby head bowling, but then you'll have to play mini games like sliding puzzles or rhythm games. Most of them feel incredibly out of place, too, when encountering them in the story.It's not conveyed very well how to deal with the ghost pirates who throw bombs, which can lead to an incredibly frustrating sequence in the underwater stage.A disappointing amount of gameplay is focused on using the bomb on pressure plates so you have timed puzzles. This usually involves jumping around the environment in a frantic pace trying to figure out how to not get the timing to be so pencil thin.SUMMARYI would have loved for this to have about one environment less than it did, but overall it's a surprisingly slick game with some great, varied art. Some bugs and general activation annoyances can make this a less than stellar experience, but don't let that stopping you from checking this out. This is an easy pickup at $10 or less.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns reminds me a lot of classic N64 platformers like Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie in the best of ways. By mixing a dark reimagining of a literary classic with stylish combat and rock-solid platforming, EA and Spicy Horse have created a gaming experience quite unlike any other. At any rate, its miles better than the lacklustre Tim Burton movie released last year. This is one rabbit hole worth tumbling down.			"

												Re-review. The game runs on UE3 and that's both a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing is the visuals are great. The bad thing is it's buggy and still to this day I hate the engine's habit of not pre-loading the textures. For a split second, Alice looks like a lip-less pile of flesh on the main menu. Game runs at 31 FPS by default and you must tweak the ini files to get 60+ FPS and unlock on disc DLC. Clear signs of this being a direct console port with no love for the PC crowd. Game is very buggy and the devs never bothered patching the game. How about you patch your existing game before going to kickstarter for that third Alice game, eh, American?Story is interesting but the acting is spotty. Not sure the awkward voices were intentional. Art is very impressive with some gothic feel. However there are some areas that look bland. Gameplay is okay but some areas are too repetitive with lengthy platforming sections that basically lets you do the same thing like jumping on mushrooms, entering keyholes and switch levers.			"

												Alice Madness Returns is the successor to American McGee's Alice.The Story is about Alice Liddell. She suffers from a trauma which effects hear reality.She often goes into the Wonderland. She suffers from this because of a fire in her family house when she was young.She lost her whole family to this fire and therefore suffers from the trauma. But something is different. Her Wonderland suffers from destruction and madness. In the game she figures out what really happened in the night of the fire.Pinpoiting the game to 1 Genre is nearly impossible because it has so many different ones.Jump & Run, Hack & Slay, Puzzle, 2D, 3D, Action, Fantasy, Horror.I rarely seen a game with so many different influences. I really enjoyed it. The game got never tedious because of this great variety in gameplay. But the main aspect of the game is the Jump & Run and Hack & Slay gameplay. She has to pass several levels. To do so she has to jump and run, fight against monsters or solve riddles and puzzles. Or sometimes just explore the world. I really like the fighting system. Its really addicting for me because it has a learning curve. The game might be difficult to new players. I in fact died very very often when playing this game the first time. What helped me was a controller though. I dont think mouse and keyboard work well in this game. You have several weapons to attack the monsters like a blade or a pepper mill machine gun. You also have to dodge the attacks of the enemies either with an umbrella or just vanishing and appearing somewhere again. This game definitely needs skill! There are also many secrets and collectibles in the levels which are fun to explore and collect.The whole game runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and it looks really beautiful!I rarely seen such amazing designed worlds. Especially the PhysX effects give the game an own touch.However, those can be quite taxing. Not even my GTX 970 could maintain 60FPS on High PhysX settings.I only had like 5% of the game slowdowns or whatever so mostly it went totally fine. Sadly the game suffers from some annoying stutter from time to time. Like all 5 minutes it hangs for a sec and then continues playing. This is not that bad and I got used to it. I dont know what exactly is causing it. Maybe the texture steaming system of the UE3 or PhysX or even EAs badly and horrible implemented copy protection.Postive:- Very nice and diverse gameplay- Interesting Story- Never gets tedious or boring- Addicting fighting system with learning curve- Beautiful designed worlds and artwork in general- Stunning PhysX effects- Nice and fitting soundtrack- Nearly totally bugfree, even without any patches, since none have been released- Limited Edition content can be activated with an easy ini edit- Steam version automatically unlocks the game on EAs Origin aswellNegative:- Some small performance and stutter problems- Annoying EA copy protection which needs an EA account- The Steam version misses additional content like the American McGee's Alice HD version.Check out my guide to obtain the HD versionRating: 8.5/10I really enjoyed this game. In fact this game was one of the best of 2011. It was totally underrated by gaming magazines for whatever reason. The art design was just so beautiful and sick at the same time. This game is not meant for young people! I mean it seriously.Also make sure to check out the first Alice. It might be a bit dated but its just as beautiful. Wouldnt mind a remake of this one!			"

												One of the weirdest and probably the most creative game I've ever seen, this is pretty good, but it is not exactly phenomenal. It has great controls, great sound, awesome crazy graphics, interesting crazy enemies, awesome weapons, awesome combat, and gorgeous graphics. It is weird and ♥♥♥♥ed up akin to the likes of a Nine Inch Nails video because lord knows Trent Reznor is a ♥♥♥♥ing weirdo. It has great sound: on my 5.1 surround sound speakers it sounds great: the sledgehammer horse pounding into the ground makes my floor vibrate and the peppergrinder machinegun blasting shots off sounds like booming thunder. One of the coolest things about it are the weapons and how they act and look when you upgrade. You get a butcher knife, a hobby horse (like a sledgehammer), a pepper grinder (machinegun), and a boiling tea kettle (like a grenade launcher). Their graphic effects and attacks change as you level them up, becoming more and more cool looking. It is also pretty long, around 15-20 hours or so, which is a nice change because most dumbass SP games are barely over 8 hours anymore. The art design is amazing. It really is a great looking game. It's definitely worth its $20 price tag, and a must buy if you can catch it on sale. Also make sure you google how to easily remove the 30fps cap for a far more enjoyable smooth 60fps experience.

												I absolutely loved the art design and music of the original Alice.  But AMR has a game breaking flaw that occurs for a lot of players.  Early in the game she gains access to an umbrella that is used as a shield to block incoming attacks.  All fine and dandy except that it is impossible to use in the standard keyboard/mouse setup.  That's  what happens on a lousy port from a console to pc. You could probably plug in a controller in your computer as a workaround but I felt so burned I never even bothered to check.  This was a known issue after the fact but no one, not Spicy Horse or EA, could be bothered to patch it.  Way to support your game, American.  Never again.			"

												A good linear RPG with combat similar to the Zelda games.  Combat isn't as good, nor is it open world, and not nearly as many weapons although there are multiple upgradeable weapon choices for both ranged and melee, and you can toggle ranged weapons while they are on their respective short cooldowns.  The graphics aren't terrible or great, but the atmosphere is wonderfull and the art is fantastic.  I'm just under 10 hours in and a little under halfway through so it seems like the game will be decent length if you don't blow through it.9/10ProsEnough weapons to keep combat interestingArt/scenary is fantasticCollectibles to findPlenty of secret places(not always so secret)Quadruple jump-Makes the platforming easier if you have issues with thatFloating-See aboveConsLinearMost of the combat isn't too hard but some fights I found wayyy too hard for how the rest of the game isGame can be pretty forgiving usually, if you die you respawn close, not always the case and some parts you mess up a jump by an inch and youre going back pretty far just to fail again.TL;DR If you were already interested and would like a linear somewhat zelda combatlike RPG worth the 20 bucks easily, and at the very least pick it up on sale.  I can see myself replaying this again, not right away, but Im not uninstalling and putting it down for good.  I dig the art too much!			"

												American McGee's Alice was incredibly popular for what it was: a generic third-person platformer/shooter. What made it stand out as a true joy and masterpiece was its phantasmic, whimsical art-direction and devious atmosphere. It is natural, then, that a sequal must either improve on the original's platforming, or at the very least give us ""more of the same"" of whatthe original does best. Alice: Madness Returns continues the trend of giving players a fantastic atmosphere and art style, but the gameplay is so atrocious that this game is hard to play, let alone reccomend.The Good:* Absolutely stunning and interesting visuals, probably some of the best I have seen for a console game. From the backdrops, to the costumes, to the platforms, to the character models, everything about this game is ocularly incredible.* The ability to shrink at any time is a great idea and is fun. However, I think the developers missed a world of opportunity to really make the game shine with this mechanic. I was hoping for something like Tiny-Huge World from Super Mario 64 - the opportunity to explore a world from an entirely new perspective.The Bad:* Bugs encountered: red mouse pointer stayed on screen while playing after navigating a menu pop-up, one tooth (the game's in-game collectible) dropped but could not be picked up, sometimes auto-aim would randomly turn on while using the ranged weapon.* While Alice performs actions, such as turning a steam vent on, she is vulnerable to attack. However, you have no control over her for several seconds during this time.* When you start a new area, you will always jump down to it from a high-up area so that there is no ""going back."" This also seems like lazy level design.* In one area where they could not use an invisible wall, the power of Alice's double-jump is purposefully nerfed so you can't reach a certain platform early.* The collision mechanic when Alice walks into a wall, or jumps into a column or something, is a good effort but feels awful. Alice sort of ""glides"" past the obstacle rather than actually interacting with it. It's as-if Alice has some sort of anti-magnetism that does not allow her to physically touch objects.* I get better FPS while in the game than while in the pause screen. What's going on with the pause screen?The Ugly:* Bad mouse control/aiming while using the ranged attack. My view was always being whipped around every which way because the computer thought I ought to aim in a completely non-sensical direction. I have a $100 mouse and this game won't let me use it.* Invisible Walls. They are everywhere. Even in places where the developers don't need them. even in front of Alice-sized holes. EVEN IN FRONT OF PLATFORMS DURING JUMPING PUZZLES.The Verdict:Playing Alice: Madness Returns will certainly make your eyes very happy, but it's a mess of a game and not worth $20. I do think you should pick it up if the game is on sale, though, just to check out the amazing visuals.			"

If you're like me, you probably looked at the screenshots and and trailer and thought ""Damn, this looks like a good game"". It is. It's exactly what you think it'd be like; exactly how it appears. Not only that, though, it's chock-full of dark humor, morbid moments, ""WTF??"" experiences, and some of the most beautiful and awesome views, scenery, and environments I've ever seen in a game.""Since then, I've played a lot more...and damn, this game just keeps getting better and better. I'd rate it among one of the best games I've ever played, actually.  And it's a very looooong game too. I've spent 14 hours on it so far and I'm not even close to halfway through it yet.  You definitely get your hours worth for this game....an easy 20-30 (and maybe more)  hours worth of game for the priceThis game is excellent.			"

												Sadly not a patch on the original American MccGee's Alice. A perfect demonstration of how even a truly great game can be turned to @**% by 'consolizing' it. Pos -- Graphics refresh looks good..- Story still seems quite interesting, and at least at the begining has a little feel of depth...Mixed - - Uses the same old difficult platform + mulitple jumps trick that can leave you taking an hour to cross a small and annoying section.Neg -- Stupidly difficult in stupid places, and not for good reasons.- Very crude clipping planes in places.. levels frequently leave ways through which you could fit through but you are not allowed to use them. Also places where scenery clipping leaves ugly holes behind scenery..- Controls kill you when fighting or jumping, camera view skews and you die, get caught on scenery and you die, lack of fine conrtol in jumping & moving when fighting - and you die.- Definite console feel to game - and not in a good way..- Just doesnt quite have the 'charm' of the original.

												I hated this game. Environments were interesting at first, but dragged on and became boring. Combat is fast but clunky and unbalanced. I think once I got the ranged weapons, I didn't use any others and just upgraded them because they were more useful. Camera control is really bad. The story tries its hardest to rewrite the previous game's story. Game promises cool boss battles but doesn't deliver as it kills them in cutscenes. Texture work just wasn't good. There wasn't much enemy variety. It kinda seemed like there was more work in the player character then ANYTHING else.I'm never touching this game again.			"

												Don't get me wrong - there are moments of true brilliance, both visually and in terms of script, in this game. This is a propper arthouse game, no doubt about that. But to experience it all you must grind for hours and hours on end. The length of this thing is ridiculous. There are five chapters there. Sounds reasonable? Not so, unfortunately. The length extends enormously, because you will die/fail and retry hundreds (literally!) of times. When after a series of lengthy action/platforming sequences you think that you're finally at the end of the chapter, you're usually not even one third way through. The change of scenery helps combat this, but everything brakes down again when you are  forced to stay in the new environment for much longer than is actually required. This is irritating as hell. And the emphasis on arcade-like (and even 2D sidescrolling!) timed jumping - mind boggling. There is no proper feeling of flow at all here.Sure, if you're a hardened gamer specializing in third person action games, get this game. You should have a blast! But if you are not (I myself have 20 years of experience, but mostly in first person action games), think twice. And if you do buy it, don't even contemplate playing it on anything but the easiest mode. Developers of this thing should point their attention towards regular people next time and get rid of this tedious platforming and trial/error based mechanics of grinding out enormously drawn-out levels.BTW, Steam says I'm 13+ hours in (actual number may be even higher, as usual), but in the game, I'm about 50% done. So for me this is a 25-30 hours game, and that is way too much for a story driven linnear action experience, imho.			"

												This is a good game, that is plagued by bugs and errors, mainly caused by EA's DRM. First off, why does EA need DRM on an offline single-player game? Second, since it's published by EA, there's no cloud saving via steam. And on Origin, cloud saving doesn't work at all. I've lost my save file twice because of this. If you like platforming games with puzzle thrown-in, I definitely recommend it. When it DOES work, the game is fun. Controls are smooth, combat is similar to Legend of Zelda with it's targeting system, you upgrade your weapons by collecting teeth(similar to the red orbs from the God of War games). I recommend getting the game, but you're probably better off buying it on xbox360 or PS3; those versions might have fewer bugs.			"

												Just as a cautionary point to those considering buying this game: if you don't like the control scheme and key bindings, I'm afraid it's hard cheese for you, because though you do have the option to change them, doing so can cause a multitude of malfunctions in-game. For example, if you change the button that activates the umbrella block, the umbrella block may just stop working altogether even after defaults are reset (unless the game is quit and re-entered), to name but one.Disregarding this, the game does tell an engaging story set in a ""corrupted"" vision of Alice's wonderland, which seems to exist entirely in her own delusions. A continuation of American McGee's first foray into the realms of Lewis Caroll (which I admit to not having played), this game makes many references to the game that preceded it, but not in a way that makes it impossible to gleam at the events that took place in said predecessor, making it an adequate starting point in the series. All in all, the world this game portrays is very absorbing, but you may find difficulty in being absorbed if the aforementioned control problems become annoying (which they easily can).			"

												It's an alright game, 6/10 maybe. The story is good, albeit very dark.The reason I don't recommend this is that this game is mainly repetition. Chapters are insanely long of platforming. The game was charming for the first 3-4 hours, by after that, it becomes tedious. Chapter 5 in particular, is ridiculously long. 2 hours of no story-telling and simply jumping and jumping and jumping until you finally get the story bit.I completed it on a fast pace at 10 hours and the last 4 were painful as I only wanted to finish the story. The gameplay is good, but combat is, again, very repetitive. Later enemies are made uncessarily difficult, and the camera, dear god the camera, it's awful. It will random lock unto things. More than once you'll die to a platform when you jump > jump > glide and then teh camera shifts and you can't see where you're going.Pros:-Really good story, good story-telling-Unique atmosphere-Unique ArtCons:-Gameplay is REPETITIVE-Combat is made gimmicky to be challenging, mare worse by awful camera and targetting system-Camer is AWFUL-Gameplay is VERY repetitive-Platform areas are made stupidly long as filler, don't be surprised to go 2 hours of non-stop platforming, puzzles, etc... with no explaination and interaction. You'll sometimes see the cat, who will tell you something funny, then it's another hour of jumping and fighting for no reasons. It's supposed to represent Alice's broken mind, we get it.It's as if they tried to make us go as mad as alice. "

												Overall:As a game it's a failure. The art and premise are rich and provocative, but the gameplay is boring and repetetive. The overarching story is nice but it's stretched thin across the 8+ hour gameplay. Damn you, lack of funding. Great to play if you want to write fanfic or immerse yourself in the universe, but not if you want an actual fun game.The good:-ArtThe art style is gorgeous. They executed a twisted wonderland marvelously, and there are many imagination-stimulating environments and objects. Alice herself is extremely well animated and rather fun to move around, even in ""reality.""The character archetypes are fun to think about. Just the whole idea of a more mature, twisted Alice in Wonderland is fertile ground.-SoundIt won't be winning any awards, but there are a few tracks that are interesting. The voice acting is generally of high quality.The bad:-StoryThe writing is subpar. The characters mostly feel bland and unendearing. The dialogue sounds a bit like what an average american would make up if you said ""give me a sentence that a british person might say"".The story itself lacks depth. It's a kid's story that was sprinkled with some superficial violence and edgy imagery to make it look more mature. And even those played it safe. They were too few and far between and just... arbitrary. Their grotesque form had no purpose or story or meaning, it was just there to be grotesque. Most of the wonderland parts just felt empty.The best part of the story was the London sequences, but every time you get a little morsel you have to go through another an hour+ of boring gameplay.-GameplayWhen you get to a new area you're at first wowed by how cool the environment is, but you quickly get tired of it as you go through the repetetive task of killing monsters and collecting teeth. Combat is mostly mindless. Once you've figured out how to kill a type enemy, the rest are a chore - not difficult, just time consuming. Increasing the difficulty only makes monsters do more damage.Then there's the platforming. It's extremely easy. You can triple jump, but you never even need the third jump unless you ♥♥♥♥ up.The game is extremely linear. Side paths never last longer than a few seconds and then you double back. Finding secrets consists of remembering to press ctrl every so often. The secrets do nothing besides give you bits of dialogue that don't really add to the story much and increase your % completion on the menu screen.Oh right. There are puzzles. They're trivial. Also, you get some weapons. They're not very interesting either. Upgrade them with teeth. Once you've upgraded them all the way the teeth are worthless and that will happen well before the end of the game if you collect them zealously.			"

												It's an alright game, 6/10 maybe. The story is good, albeit very dark.The reason I don't recommend this is that this game is mainly repetition. Chapters are insanely long of platforming. The game was charming for the first 3-4 hours, by after that, it becomes tedious. Chapter 5 in particular, is ridiculously long. 2 hours of no story-telling and simply jumping and jumping and jumping until you finally get the story bit.I completed it on a fast pace at 10 hours and the last 4 were painful as I only wanted to finish the story. The gameplay is good, but combat is, again, very repetitive. Later enemies are made uncessarily difficult, and the camera, dear god the camera, it's awful. It will random lock unto things. More than once you'll die to a platform when you jump > jump > glide and then teh camera shifts and you can't see where you're going.Pros:-Really good story, good story-telling-Unique atmosphere-Unique ArtCons:-Gameplay is REPETITIVE-Combat is made gimmicky to be challenging, mare worse by awful camera and targetting system-Camer is AWFUL-Gameplay is VERY repetitive-Platform areas are made stupidly long as filler, don't be surprised to go 2 hours of non-stop platforming, puzzles, etc... with no explaination and interaction. You'll sometimes see the cat, who will tell you something funny, then it's another hour of jumping and fighting for no reasons. It's supposed to represent Alice's broken mind, we get it.It's as if they tried to make us go as mad as alice. "

												Just as a cautionary point to those considering buying this game: if you don't like the control scheme and key bindings, I'm afraid it's hard cheese for you, because though you do have the option to change them, doing so can cause a multitude of malfunctions in-game. For example, if you change the button that activates the umbrella block, the umbrella block may just stop working altogether even after defaults are reset (unless the game is quit and re-entered), to name but one.Disregarding this, the game does tell an engaging story set in a ""corrupted"" vision of Alice's wonderland, which seems to exist entirely in her own delusions. A continuation of American McGee's first foray into the realms of Lewis Caroll (which I admit to not having played), this game makes many references to the game that preceded it, but not in a way that makes it impossible to gleam at the events that took place in said predecessor, making it an adequate starting point in the series. All in all, the world this game portrays is very absorbing, but you may find difficulty in being absorbed if the aforementioned control problems become annoying (which they easily can).			"

												I was really disappointed in this game.The premise seemed promising, you would think that it would be a nice dark take on the Alice in Wonderland franchise. For its age, it's pretty alright. The movements are fluid enough, the constantly changing outfits and new weapons were interesting, and the story has a good concept. But it has some serious issues. It really ruins the atmosphere when you're constantly getting stuck to the ground, having Alice nonstop walk without my hand on the keys, and monsters glitching so they don't take any damage. You don't become very compelled to continue as the story has barely any development. Most of the voice acting is pretty good, but you will find characters or lines that just sound corny and out of place. The puzzles are challenging enough, but very repetitive. I really want to recommend this game, and I would if you're okay with all of the issues I had. The character design is unique, the premise is interesting, and if you love Alice in Wonderland you'll at the least tolerate it. If you're on the fence about it, wait until a sale like the summer or winter sales. It comes down to $5 and at that price it's worth it.			"

												Published by EA, made by a bunch of Chinese, no offense.The most annoying part during the whole game for me were the terrible but seriously. Horrible hitboxes.This made the game harder then it actually was.Besides that, the target switching when focussed was annoying too.Also not knowing wich way to go, either it's the next step forward, or a secret level.And sometimes you'd skip secrets knowingly you thought they were the next step to progress in the game instead of a secret, vise versa. You could replay the entire level for the secrets but they're pretty useless anyway.You could speedrun this game, although with all the bugs and annoying features i doubt it.The good thing about this game;It is a good platformer for casuals and an intresting story.Although it's a bit mind boggling, it's a different approach you could say?The graphics are good, the mini games sometimes really sucked because of the hitboxes.The bossfights are easy.What made the fights hard were just the ammount of HP they have and the creatures were kinda repetitive.I still would recommend this game though.And if there ever came to be a sequel i'd play it.But i'll probabbly never re-play this game again.7/10			"

												American Mcgee showed the world how a story could turned into a dark, twisted material to read and/or play with his 2000 platformer, American Mcgee's Alice. - and after eleven years, he published the next installment of his Alice series, Madness Returns. Now, this is actually an undone product due to the same story as always; Publishers pushing deadlines over Developers. - Alice: Madness Returns is actually a game without its boss fights, because of this. And, again, because of the same reason; The Publisher; It can't get patches to actually put boss fights into this lovely game.What makes Madness Returns a unique game is majorly the intriguing storyline it has to offer, alongside with beautiful level designs, overall atmosphere/ambient and the sad, smooth, disturbing soundtrack album from talented names. - With the mixture of intense gameplay, level-based dynamic mechanics and a twisted sense of humor, Madness Returns offers more than just your regular, repetitive action/platformer game.On a side note: I was about ten years old when I first played American Mcgee's Alice and after eleven years, the moment I've got my hands on this game, I was living a dream once more.

												I really tried to give this game a chance as I am a big fan of Alice In Wonderland however after hours of repetitive game play and level designs you have to wonder 'when does a game stop being a game and just become a jumping simulator'The 'game' seems great at first, I was a fan of the art and the story seemed to have great potential, but after spending 8 hours jumping from one platform to another it can slowly drive a man insane. The whole game just seemed rushed and lazy, you can't make a something with minimal effort and associate it with a well known franchise to pass it off as a game.

Something that I truly disliked was that the world is too linear. However, it does make sense in it's own right because your train of thought doesn't take unexpected turns and leaps to completely different ideas. I also disliked how the game is too short, and the levels should've been bigger, longer, and more puzzling. Overall, the battle system and the game was fun to play and I consider the artwork and the story of the game to be quite interesting and somewhat intriguing.			"

												At first I thought it will be a great story. Perhaps it is.Then I was amazed with graphical design. Not just graphics but artistic touch which makes the game remarkable. Models are great. But it seems like even decent machine is not capable of running it with good details - optimization neglected?When I fell of the cliff for the first time it was wonderful. I didn't know yet how much I will hate this 'death' animation. Then I started to think - why do I repeat this jump. And again. And again. Because I really want to get there to check that item... Yes... Do I? Another place looked like a reachable one but it was not. Bad move. Get back for the same series of jumps again.It is neither ""adventure"" nor ""action"", not even ""platformer"". It is damn arcade! And this twists whole experience and ruins possibly great game. And it changes my vote to one huge ""NO!"".Furthermore EA account is necessary.

												The game is broken, which is unfortunate.  Every boss battle that requires the use of the umbrella also requires some tedious fix in the settings and files to make the umbrella actually work properly.  The fix also has the annoying property of altering the game's character controls in an obnoxious way.  So while the game is beautifully designed, with a great score, and fun gameplay, the broken umbrella flaw, which does not appear to have an official patch or fix any time soon, makes the game almost unplayable.

												I really wanted to like Alice: Madness Returns, and I do like some things about it. The story is a dark and deep tale of a young girl with a shattered mind. The characters, both real and imaginary, are compelling. The art dances back and forth between hauntingly beautiful and terrifyingly grotesque. Unfortunately, the game falters when it comes to combat and level design. The combat is exciting and visceral in the earlier levels but quickly becomes a hassle as the lock-on system allows off-screen enemies to repeatedly assault you with lunges and ranged attacks. Meanwhile, the level design is outdated, completely linear, and relies heavily on a small handful overused mechanics. Oddly, there is an interesting ""shrinking"" mechanic that seems to have a lot of potential, but never evolves beyond fitting into small holes and finding invisble platforms. These glaring flaws aside, there are also more than a few bugs - especially in later levels. If you can look past these issues there is a good game somewhere in there, but overall, Madness Returns just feels unpolished.			"

												Casual platformer with an amazing aesthetic (the art book and soundtrack for this game on Amazon is probably worth it alone). I stress casual becuase it isn't particular difficult. The type of platforming is rather nastalgic in a sort of early Crash Bandicoot 3d platformer sort of way.I downvoted this game because the PC port is regretably bad. The console suffered from texture pop ins, but on the PC you start to see screen tears, and dramatic frame droppage. It should be worth noting gameplay wise, if you can stomach the bugs... the first few levels are lackluster, the water levels in particular are incredible boring. I fully recomend grabbing some coffee in order for you to trudge on through this part. Story is weak and unfathomable at times during the first half of the game (water level being the prime offender), but after the water level the plot starts to be more understandable and at times, interesting. Although many of the Wonderland characters are vague to a fault. I can only imagine this is the case in order for the mystery in the story to remain a mystery (albiet the cut scenes sort of spoil it, won't elaborate how, but in the defense of the developers it was done by a different studio at the last moment).

												Freaking amazing! Love it! The scenery is fantasticly wonderous and everchanging. The mysterious eerie feel of the game really captures and keeps interest! Totally got me hooked! The puzzles are very well designed and everything feels so wierd. You will not at any point in the game feel comfortable and you will feel on the run even in relatively peaceful places. A total rush. I would highly reccomend a controller to play. (the keyboard controls gave me trouble and are so difficult to pick up) The only thing I would complain about is how the camera tips back and forth and every which way when in combat, even when focused. It feels a bit awkward and takes getting used to. Other than that, fluttering and twirling through the air, bouncing on mushrooms, and discovering broken memories are sure to keep the game fun and interesting.  If you love a good puzzle adventure this is for you! (If you can handle the mind-mangling wonderland of course...) 9.5/10			"

Other people have had this error with the PC version of this game and it's a shame because this game is really fun. I suggest you buy it on console just to be sure.			"

												The level designs are very interesting and I find myself sometimes just looking around just to take in the senery. That said, the game play is dull and I have no idea what is going on story wise. If your just wanting to kill some time then go ahead and play this one, but if your wanting something more I'd suggest you pass on this one. Its not very good.			"

												Pros:+Amazing art style and idea.Well, that sums it up for pros, now consSo, cons.. yeah:-Lets start with worthless PC port, shall we? 30 FPS lock. Barely any graphical and other options. In-game menu seems to be slow for some reason. While it's playable with keyboard, some parts of the game are not. Also, some button prompts are shown for Xbox controller, while it is not connected. This may lead to a quite frustation.-It is, needlessly long and repetitive. The combat, the platforming, even plot elements seems to repeat themselves every chapter.-Game also constantly fails to tell you some key moments, which can get you stuck sometimes.-Most annoying and plain stupid minigames, thankfully, some of then can be skipped, but, unfortunately, not all of them. Seriously, did they actually think that it would be a good idea to throw in some qte, puzzles, 2d platforming or even pinball arcade !@#$ in the middle of an action? I can hardly imagine.-The secrets are met so often, they become generic. Even worse, finding them don't seem to reward you in any way, shape or form. In fact, they make you take longer paths, which result in major waste of time. Well, sometimes you get enough stuff from secrets to upgrade your weapons, but you can do it without secrets. You can, however, upgrade your health via secrets only. But, you have to find so many, and it give you so little, you would not want even bother in the first place.-Countless bugs and glitches. It's just terrible. Sometimes you have a cursor appear in game for some reason (they even multiply), other times Alice just starts running forward after cutscene or loadscreen and dies horribly in first pit.. yeah. Some invisible walls that you always hit every once in a while, some stuff glitch through, some enemies getting stuck in walls and you can't get them out, so u have to restart checkpoint. And so on and so forth. Countless, really.Overall ~ I would love to like this game, but I can't. It caused me too much pain. It could have been a good.. no, amazing game, assuming the team had a decent programmers and level designers.			"

												I really love the artwork in this game and for the most part the platforming gameplay. The developers have done a great job of the game itself.But... it really sucks that this game requires that you register and login to another Steam-like UI. I purchase games on Steam because I want to play them within Steam's ecosystem; it is really disappointing that this game goes against the grain and tries to bring along an entirely different system.Almost everytime I go to run this game the other launcher UI asks me to sign in and I can never remember the password that I came up with for that account and end up not bothering to play it. It is for this reason alone that I cannot recommend the game.			"

												At first I thought it will be a great story. Perhaps it is.Then I was amazed with graphical design. Not just graphics but artistic touch which makes the game remarkable. Models are great. But it seems like even decent machine is not capable of running it with good details - optimization neglected?When I fell of the cliff for the first time it was wonderful. I didn't know yet how much I will hate this 'death' animation. Then I started to think - why do I repeat this jump. And again. And again. Because I really want to get there to check that item... Yes... Do I? Another place looked like a reachable one but it was not. Bad move. Get back for the same series of jumps again.It is neither ""adventure"" nor ""action"", not even ""platformer"". It is damn arcade! And this twists whole experience and ruins possibly great game. And it changes my vote to one huge ""NO!"".Furthermore EA account is necessary. Unnecessary DRM, spying and God knows what else. Avoid.			"

												Casual platformer with an amazing aesthetic (the art book and soundtrack for this game on Amazon is probably worth it alone). I stress casual becuase it isn't particular difficult. The type of platforming is rather nastalgic in a sort of early Crash Bandicoot 3d platformer sort of way.I downvoted this game because the PC port is regretably bad. The console suffered from texture pop ins, but on the PC you start to see screen tears, and dramatic frame droppage. It should be worth noting gameplay wise, if you can stomach the bugs... the first few levels are lackluster, the water levels in particular are incredible boring. I fully recomend grabbing some coffee in order for you to trudge on through this part. Story is weak and unfathomable at times during the first half of the game (water level being the prime offender), but after the water level the plot starts to be more understandable and at times, interesting. Although many of the Wonderland characters are vague to a fault. I can only imagine this is the case in order for the mystery in the story to remain a mystery (albiet the cut scenes sort of spoil it, won't elaborate how, but in the defense of the developers it was done by a different studio at the last moment).

												Looks nice, but overall a bad game. Lots of jumping puzzles with light combat. Controls are awful. Camera is terrible when trying to lock on for focus mode. Also very inconsistent in checkpoints. Sometimes you're put right back. Other times you are set way back and have to do the same lame jumping puzzles over again just to get to the same spot. Not worth the money, even on sale.			"

												The game is broken, which is unfortunate.  Every boss battle that requires the use of the umbrella also requires some tedious fix in the settings and files to make the umbrella actually work properly.  The fix also has the annoying property of altering the game's character controls in an obnoxious way.  So while the game is beautifully designed, with a great score, and fun gameplay, the broken umbrella flaw, which does not appear to have an official patch or fix any time soon, makes the game almost unplayable.  I cannot recommend this game until it is properly fixed.			"

That is why I have to say the upgrade to this combat system just felt like it fit just as well, if not even better than the first game!

												Excellent and engaging combat set in imaginative and dazzling worlds, with a marvellous soundtrack. Marred mostly by tedious and repetitive level design, frustrating camera and enemy lock-in issues, and a bit rough around the edges with regards to bugs and smooth controls. The minigames are a bit crap, too.It's a dark, twisted little number with flowery writing and a fairly interesting, if predictable, story. The graphics aren't too bad but clearly aimed at consoles, but little features like Alice's hair and dress flowing as she moves adds a nice touch (I believe the game was a bit of a tech demo for Nvidia's hair rendering tech, but it looked nice enough on my AMD card).If there was more emphasis on combat than platforming (The latter is so easy you'll be hard pressed to ever be challenged by it), I'd have probably enjoyed it much more, especially with the potential of enemy combinations they could have had.Still, recommended, it's charming enough that boring and linear level design is at least eclipsed by good combat, writing, and art direction.

The movement was clunky, story had potential but the writing urked me, the combat is just awful, and the game just overall felt very unpolished. I'm a fan of third person adventure/platforming games but this, despite it's ""very positive"" reviews, just didn't do it for me. About 40 minutes in, I felt that no matter what would come further on in the game, if the combat, collectables, environment, and writing left me wanting, the game was simply unredeemable.			"

												5/10Not a very good game. While visually interesting at first, the polish and freshness runs out in the first half hour or so, and  the game turns into endless copy pasted envirnments. The screenshots above are not representative of the game as a whole, and that trailer is even worse. While I'm not one to gripe about graphics, the character models look and move like ps2 era npcs. The game also runs fairly poorly, with freezing and frame skipping on a regular basis, and whenever anything chaotic happens the game slows to a crawl. The enemy designs are not particularly varied, and the main type of enemy is repeated ad nosium, the only variants simply being bigger versions of the small ones. The plot is virtually none existant, and isn't communicated much to the player except through vague and incongruently drawn cutscenes. Perhaps those who played the original (or prequel? the relationship is unclear in this game) game American Mcgee's Alice would get more here, but as for this game on its own, practically no story. Voice acting gets irritating very quickly, especially the main npc's like hatter and march hare, and a lot of the clips sound like they don't even belong in the game (muted or too quiet, jumpy breaks between lines). The voice actress playing Alice sounds incredibly bored the whole time. Game play is straight forward and gets stale very quickly, and the few minigames end up being tedious. Platforming is not great, as alice's jumping mechanics are hard to control. A section around the middle in the souls locker area is particularly tedious thanks to the bad controls. Overall, a great first thirty minutes, but it overstays its welcome beyond that and becomes a generic, gray hack and slash. Might as well just play God of War or any other game with this exact formula. TLDR: In conclusion, gray and generic.  Best parts are the menus and the first two areas. Runs like crap with bad controls. Mind numbing and time cocnsuming as it goes on, even the characters are bored. In a word, Mediocre.			"

												I loved American McGee's Alice when I was in high school and I've played Madness Returns for a few hours on a friend's XBox 360. I quite enjoyed the game, so I bought it for myself here on Steam. But although it's been published a few years ago already and despite my specs being far better than what's required or recommended for Madness Returns, the FPS constantly drop in areas with many enemies or just a lot of things going on. Considering that this game has a lot of jumping and falling into bottomless pits, it becomes entirely unplayable as soon as the framerate starts dropping. All in all, this just seems like another lazy and badly optimized console port.			"

												Are you a little mad? Perhaps you consider yourself to be as mad as a hatter? I must confess that this game is great and that you are missing out. You're running out of time, friend. Hurry it up! If you don't buy Alice: Madness Returns, then how will you ever experience the crazy happenings in Wonderland to save it in time? What do I mean? I don't have time to explain, but Wonderland is being destroyed! 'Come Alice, don't dawdel. You've already missed the train!' Have you forgotten that Wonderland needs you? We will give you a bloody knife, a pepper shooting projectile weapon, a hobby horse, or anything else you desire so long as you come and help us! Are you crazy enough to buy the game? Well, we all are a little mad.			"

												I'm barely recommending this game.  The visual artwork in this game is incredible - easily one of the most impressive I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, to see the art you have to play through the game - and that's not so fun.So look at those screenshots that Steam is popping through and thinking they look incredible, you're good to go.  Get the game and don't be afraid to pop the difficulty level down to ""easy"" so you can get to the next area.  If you're looking at the shots just to try and figure out how the game plays then wait for a discount.  A deep discount.P.S.  The game is beautiful under NVIDIA's 3D Vision with a HeliX mod!			"

												The game is loaded with beautiful visuals that you could be hitting F12 repeatedly and always get something cool. You don't need to play the original American McGee's Alice to enjoy this sequel, as the recap is listed in the extra content section. However, it does make the story a lot clearer. The downside of this platformer is some of the difficult jumps and timings required. Be prepared to come across some frustrating jump sequences and starting over several times.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a very atmospheric, Burton-esque game that bears resemblance to the old glory of the Medievil series. Good longivity, challenging platforming sections, an intricate fighting system and rewarding collectables are the strong points of this game. The only downside is that the emphasis is strongly on platforming. Some sections are quite hard, which may lead to irration and even rage quitting. Nevertheless, a terrific action-adventure.			"

												In American McGee's Clive Barker's Archer Maclean's Alice: Brown Returns: Chapter IV of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa, Alice has grown up and decided she will only play mature games for mature gamers such as herself. You'll explore dozens of exotic locations such as a mushroom forest, an ice level, a castle, and Tim Burton's Beltan Zipper land, all of which have been delicately roasted to a nice golden brown hue.This game manages the rare feat of feeling long enough to be tedious, but short enough to leave you feeling unsatisfied. Though perhaps your enjoyment of it will be heightened if you first read ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Through The Looking Glass,"" and play ""American McGee's Alice,"" as the game seems to expect you to. You did do that, right?			"

												If you like Psychonauts, then you're likely to enjoy Alice: Madness Returns; (in fact, there's an easter egg that gives a nod to Psychonauts in the Queen's Castle). Like Psychonauts, it's a highly stylized action-adventure platformer with amazing characters, story, and level design. Two warnings however:1) The combat can feel a bit overwhelming at times due to the number of enemies and the not so great lock-on system and camera. 2) Parts of the game are a bit twitch/reflex heavy.

												I really like the game but when it comes down to it some people might have problems with it if they are playing with normal graphics. I had problems with the graphics on my old crappy computer and when i upgraded i found that EA screwed me over once again because steam has to use the steam key system it messes with the buyers usage of the game making them have to go through an origin account so that EA can make more money. This  game was fine but the fact that steam had to go though origin to actualy get anywhere with this is apaulling			"

												Great game. A very creative and dark twist on the Alice in Wonderland world.PROS:-amazing surreal and often disturbing art design-very dark and demented story with many adult themes (this is not a kid's game)-interesting weapons-combat is great-enemies are unique and require different strategies to defeat, keeping the combat fresh-platforming is very solid-lots of hidden collectibles (if you're into that kind of thing)CONS (sorta):-the platforming segments drag on for waaaaay too long, making a game that could/should have been about 7-8 hours turn into 14+, however the story was so good i personally felt compelled to tough it out and i don't regret it-keyboard and mouse controls are not the best but they are playable, i preferred a controller-the game is locked at 30fps, HOWEVER there is an extremely easy fix in the config files that allows you to change it to whatever you want, i set mine to 60 and it never dropped below that (GTX 760), so it's really not a reason to avoid this game-you do have to sign in to your EA account the first time you launch it, but again, not really a reason to avoid this game			"

												Hands down the best game I've played all year and most definitely one of the best games I've played ever.American McGee has made an incredible comeback with this sequel. I fondly remember playing American McGee's Alice in high school but Madness Returns is volumes better in all aspects of concept, storyline, graphics, and gameplay. This game takes on more of a platform concept which incorporates plenty of jumping, twirling, and floating in the air. This is a beautiful psychological horror game with jaw dropping artwork and a very developed storyline. It is a highly grotesque game in all the right ways. Mcgee takes an even further step away from the classic Alice prototype and recreates an even more disturbing and grown up Wonderland. The fighting in this game is much more complex than the original and it is gorgeous to watch. The vorpal blade is the only returning weapon, but there are new and more exciting weapons including the hobby horse, which was probably my favourite addition. Alice's outfits change with her state of mind and the parts of Wonderland which she visits. There are ""mini-game"" sections added throughout that are fun to play. Absolutely brilliant game. Highly recommend. 10/10			"

												At first I thought it was awful as I had to wander pointlessly through an orphanage without any help/tutorial/explanation. Then on entering Wonderland I thought it was brilliant - fantastically imaginative and witty. Now on being stuck in a tedious boss battle with the March Hare I'm back to feeling it's tedious again.Basically Prince of Persia 3D but with Alice. Generally worth the bother if you like that sort of game and it is mostly fun and creative (love the EyePots and the Pepper Gun), but they could have cut out some of the annoying autosave nonsense which makes more difficult sections a drag when you've died and then have to redo half the section again!

												Alice: Madness Returns is the sequel to the cult hit American McGee's Alice. This is a game that takes the familiar wonderland and turns it on its head, making it a morbid, gruesome and dangerous place. In this game, Wonderland is the delusion of a disturbed girl who is seeking an escape from her dreary life and forgiveness for her failures. Alice really delivers in terms of striking visuals and an art style that is reminiscent of the films of Tim Burton, but different enough that it doesn't feel like a direct imitation. Alice herself changes in each zone of the game, her dress taking on different elements of goth, S&M or Steampunk attire. Enemies and npcs are bizarre and magical and discovering more of them compels one to continue playing.  The only thing I dislike about Alice is how familiar it feels. It is very much an action platformer at its heart, with Alice taking on the monsters of Wonderland and of her own psyche with a magical butcher knife and a pepper grinder which acts as a machine gun. However, it is a very strong action platformer with plenty of hidden areas and challenging jumping puzzles that make the experience compelling, challenging and rewarding. While the game is in a genre that I feel stopped being intresting in the early 2000s, Alice has interesting enough scenery and characters and a good enough overall story to keep most players interested. It is worth it for the visuals alone. Play this one if you want to play a fun, challenging game that is not too deep.			"

												Has been an enjoyable experience up to a point where you are doing timed platforming in darkness with hidden elements all around that you need to jump onto. The elements disapear after a while so you need to be spot on when it comes to speed and timing. If you fail too many times (I'd say around 6-8 times) you are thrown out of the 'arena' and need to try to do it all from scratch. Well no, I value my time too much to go through that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Frankly I would be ashamed if I was the game developer who thought this was a good game mechanic to add to the game.			"

												Its a cool game but man does it get boring. After awhile you realize your just doing the same actions over and over and its just not fun anymore. Had the game been 10 hours long max or even 6 to 7 hours long it would have been alot more enjoyable if they cut out the busy work and repatitive padding.Unfortunately its 13 hours long and very padded with any fun moments spread so far inbetween that I can't recomend this over a classic third person platformer. Its in the style of the classics but in terms of gameplay it misses the point that not even my real enjoyment of the story and setting can make me want to play this anymore.Its a game that feels like work to play through to get to a fun area only to get bored of that and have what feels like hours between another fun part. If a game is a chore to play, its not worth playing.I'm halfway through it atm and I keep feeling like I should beat it but then I go ""Eugh, I'll have to sit here repeating the same puzzles and crap that I just did for the last 6 or so hours"".

												Alice is a great platformer, featuring fluid animations and dazzling twisted visuals.  The art style of the various ""chapters"" varies significantly, as does Alice's ""dress"" which billows with each step.  The world features many characters and some excellent voice acting.  The story can be difficult to follow at times, and also some chapters drag on much too long - my playthrough took around 20 hours which is lengthy for a platformer without RPG elements - 10-12 seems like a better target.  However, I was pleased with the overall experience and definitely recommend it for those interested in the genre.  The PC version features high def textures and Physx support for nVidia cards.  I do recommend that you visit the steam forum to learn how to tweak the game performance - it can make a huge difference in frame rates and visual quality.			"

												This game blends beauty and darkness in an awesome way.  The story while veiled behind the events of the game is subtle but disturbing.  The controls are quite solid, like most 3D platformers the games camera is very finicky and will likely result in more deaths than anything else.  The game is quite respectful of your time though, and falling deaths result in little to no punishment in terms of progression.  8/10			"

I was lucky enough, I guess, so I can do that without problem. EA, why you do this?And another problem is after activate the game, you can't just click play, you need to tweak the config file first. Because if you didn't tweak it, you will encounter lag, control error. NO OFFICIAL PATCH for fix this problem. Just do it manual by tweaking.This game is for advanced user who understand to tweaking the setting file. For normal user, this game is not recommended.			"

												Alice is a great platformer, featuring fluid animations and dazzling twisted visuals.  The art style of the various ""chapters"" varies significantly, as does Alice's ""dress"" which billows with each step.  The world features many characters and some excellent voice acting.  The story can be difficult to follow at times, and also some chapters drag on much too long - my playthrough took around 20 hours which is lengthy for a platformer without RPG elements - 10-12 seems like a better target.  However, I was pleased with the overall experience and definitely recommend it for those interested in the genre.  The PC version features high def textures and Physx support for nVidia cards.  I do recommend that you visit the steam forum to learn how to tweak the game performance - it can make a huge difference in frame rates and visual quality.			"

												Has been an enjoyable experience up to a point where you are doing timed platforming in darkness with hidden elements all around that you need to jump onto. The elements disapear after a while so you need to be spot on when it comes to speed and timing. If you fail too many times (I'd say around 6-8 times) you are thrown out of the 'arena' and need to try to do it all from scratch. Well no, I value my time too much to go through that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Frankly I would be ashamed if I was the game developer who thought this was a good game mechanic to add to the game.			"

												In American McGee's Clive Barker's Archer Maclean's Alice: Brown Returns: Chapter IV of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa, Alice has grown up and decided she will only play mature games for mature gamers such as herself. You'll explore dozens of exotic locations such as a mushroom forest, an ice level, a castle, and Tim Burton's Beltan Zipper land, all of which have been delicately roasted to a nice golden brown hue.This game manages the rare feat of feeling long enough to be tedious, but short enough to leave you feeling unsatisfied. Though perhaps your enjoyment of it will be heightened if you first read ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Through The Looking Glass,"" and play ""American McGee's Alice,"" as the game seems to expect you to. You did do that, right?			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a very atmospheric, Burton-esque game that bears resemblance to the old glory of the Medievil series. Good longivity, challenging platforming sections, an intricate fighting system and rewarding collectables are the strong points of this game. The only downside is that the emphasis is strongly on platforming. Some sections are quite hard, which may lead to irration and even rage quitting. Nevertheless, a terrific action-adventure.			"

												This game has a low rating for a good reason, however, Ill just describe the area that I got stuck on.  It was in the mad hatters domain, near the end of it where there is a maze of pounding fists you need to navigate.  At the last part of this maze there is what I call a mini-boss area.  You jump past some pounding fists on to a ledge and there are a bunch of baddies around you need to defeat.The big guy in the middle is a tough one you faced before where you had to block and/or reflect his attacks with an umbrella by hitting the E key.  However this game is so flaky 75% of the time when I hit the E key, nothing happened.  I could not harm this guy because he was blocking 100% of the times. I assume the trick was to bounce his bombs back at him, yet I could NEVER get that damn umbrelle to pop out when I wanted it to.Further more there are a bunch of other things attacking you at this point.This next part brings up another major annoyance.  Check point saves.  Now while this can be OK, it depends on the developer putting them in intellegent points.  You might think the right before and after a boss fight would qualify as MUST HAVE check points. Not in this game.  Nope, if you fail the boss fight you have to do the ENTIRE AREA all over again.  I mean there is even a LOADING SCREEN betten the last save and the boss fight.  Thats how far it is.After trying about 9 times on easy (I have no idea what that setting does, I lowed to the bottom just for this one fight) I gave up.I paid $2.99 for the game.  Don't waste your money.  Its super linear and very unispiring.  The controls are very wonky and difficult to use in combat.  The camera is also wonky which is bad for a puzzle platformer.			"

												I loved American McGee's Alice when I was in high school and I've played Madness Returns for a few hours on a friend's XBox 360. I quite enjoyed the game, so I bought it for myself here on Steam. But although it's been published a few years ago already and despite my specs being far better than what's required or recommended for Madness Returns, the FPS constantly drop in areas with many enemies or just a lot of things going on. Considering that this game has a lot of jumping and falling into bottomless pits, it becomes entirely unplayable as soon as the framerate starts dropping. All in all, this just seems like another lazy and badly optimized console port.			"

												This game is some kind of hack and slash wannabe. Although it is sometimes repetitive and boring, the story is awesome and it leaves you in the mood for playing more and more, just to get to the end. The soundtrack will please those who like violins and stuff. The character design is very, very beautiful, and it adds a special touch to the game. Good for people who want to play a fun game with a decent storyline. 7/10.			"

 great game design  This game is a must for every Alice in Wonderland fan and lovers of twisted and dark fairytales.It's got an interesting story and great character and enviroment design.I spent almost an hour with taking screenshots for drawing refences.The game is a bit buggy sometimes (can't change weapon and are stuck with the one your holding atm) and in the german version you need to edit a file since the 'E' key to use the umbrella won't work and you can't beat the boss.But the game experience makes up for it!

												This game has striking visuals! The graphics are  very beautiful. The major problem with the game is the horrible combat system. IT IS *FUBAR*!!!! Get caught, you lose your target. Then you need to reaquire your target. If you pick the wrong one, you need to cycle through the targets to get the one you want. All while getting attacked. So if you get hit again, you can start the above process all over.The platform action for this game is decent, but has many bugs leading you to fall to your death over and over.If you feel like going mad like Alice or need to overboil your blood in fustration, this game is for you.

												While the environment, characters, and story are neat (which is what drew me to the game in the first place) I can't deny that I am dissappointed in many aspects of the gameplay. There are may bugs, and you can't make your own key bindings. Well, you CAN but that just adds to the bugs. Then there are moments that the camera angle randnomly changes and makes movement feel just wrong. Even though there were many aspects of the game I liked I honestly can't recommend it to anyone unless it were free to play.			"

												Pros:- Awesome female protagonist.- Decent storyline.- Four unique weapons, each upgradable.- Colourful cast of characters.- Different outfits with different abilities and attributes.- Each level is completely different from the last.- More than a dozen different enemies.- A dark twist on the Alice in Wonderland franchise.Cons:- Quite linear.- Once you've fully upgraded each weapon, you have nothing to spend your coins on.- Not a lot of replay value. - Very much a hack-and-slash game, with little changing in terms of combat throughout the game.Rating: 7/10Definitely worth a buy when it's on sale, otherwise only pick this up if you're a die-hard fan of Alice in Wonderland or just like hack-and-slash games c:			"

												If Alice In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass were written with a crazy touch of irony and satirical comedy, this game is full crazy and nothing more, taking the story of the famous Alice Liddell where the previous entry (American McGee's Alice) stopped.New and old shadows lurk in the broken mind of Alice and you'll have to guide her down the Rabbit hole once again to take on a journey that will uncover the most secrets truth behind the poor girl's family tragic death.The game is stunningly beutyful, with landscapes reflecting the constantly mental change of the main character, reflected upon the Wonderland.If you're a youngster, play it as a beautyful adventure.....if you're an adult, well, there'll be some harsh and bitter bits to swallow along the road, as the thematics will carve deeper and deeper in the abyss of the human nature the further the game progresses.My final vote: the game is simple and funny, an action platformer, with an awesome taste for art and dialogues loyal to the previous game and the books. Still it has some technical flaws, but nothing unbearable.8/10 "

												I don't know how to adequately describe this game. It is roughly equal parts mystery, hack and slash, shooter, and platformer with limited puzzles. The story plays out such that a normal player is likely to be learning along with Alice as opposed to simply knowing all that is and will happen and could be classified as a psycological thriller or perhaps horror for a genre. I might also tag this as a visual novel as the story progresses rather fluidly as you play instead of getting huge chunks then nothing at all for extended times.They executed the game better than I could have ever expected and while this may not be a game for everyone, just rating it on factors of quality in leiu of personal preferences, I would say this is a perfect game.Voice acting and characters all feel right.Environments are right for each chapter.The music is placed well to set the mood.Controls are smooth (I used a controller).The only things that bothered me were lack of defined boundaries and that it is usually impossible to backtrack if you missed anything. Fortunately death by falling off edges does not carry any significant penalty, so in the end, it really came down to just not being able to back track.			"

This is a game worthy of the title ""2016 game"" and it was made in 2011... Buy it now, It's steam summer sale. I purchased it 2 days ago, I finished it now. I didn't catch all the collectibles and such. But it wasn't a speedrun either.Art      --- 10/10   > The art is just wow... It's beautiful! So beautiful I took a lot of screenshots during my gameplay. They're on my profile if you wanna see them.Sound --- 9/10   > The SFX can get repetitive (specially the mouse factory) but it's amazing (try to shrink multiple times in a row xD It's funny)Story  --- 20/10 (WOW)   > There is a twist at the end, and the revelations throughout the game make you wanna play more. At the end you're like : ""What? He did what to who??? O_O!!!""Recommended!! Buy it now It's less than 3USD, it's cheap and it's a game experience you won't forget.			"

												Think what you want about American McGee as a character in the gaming industry, but his vision of Alice is at least as good as some of Tim Burton's weaker moments.  With a crazy art style, this twisted approach to a nonsensical tale is only hurt by the same problem I find in most third-person action platformers: camera frustrations during close combat and jumping.  I recommend you turn the beautiful graphics down until they don't stutter, use a controller, and set the combat to easy.  It makes a world of difference.			"

												Only interesting if you want to follow the almost interesting story. The art direction here is top-notch. Too bad technicalities and a very crap support for steam (no achievements either) hold it back to be a good game.This is pretty much a VERY simplistic 3rd person hack and slash with usually tedious puzzles holding you back from venturing further. The levels look great but the time spent in each are stretched in such boring and unintuitive ways that they become tiresome and lose their novelty. All in all, Pass unless you are interested in the artwork or mildly interesting story.			"

												Art - Droll - Jump - Smash - Hack - Slay - Jump - Fall - Jump - Fall -Jump - Fall - Jump - Land - Jump - Land - Jump - Fall - Back on the Platform - Rage!This game is wonderful and it gives you the ability to become one of the most interesting characters in the gaming-industry: An psychotic female underage/teenager with morbid thoughts and the will to destroy her inner emptiness after seeing her whole family die in the hellfire that was taking down her once so called home (even so everyone seems to be mean to her in the first place - thank you collectible memorys).Now, besides the trouble of getting through the game for me personal (a lot of puking was included, thanks to motion sickness), I really have to say that the game was much easier with an controller. Than again the controller didn't help with the glitchy jumping in this game and you will jump a LOT!The biggest flaw for the game is the endless fights against the endless enemies, in endless stages after endless jumps and endless falling because of the endless problems with the double-jump. It is boring. If it wouldn't be for the great story, I would have never played this for sure.Would I say ""Buy it!"" Yes/No - Where are my Nes/Yo-buttons?6/10 I do see the beauty, but there is the beast.			"

												This is one of those games you really want to like, but can't.The art style is excellent, the environments are fantastic looking, the animation work is top notch. But the gameplay is atrocious, mostly due to being a bad console port. The interface, the controls, they didn't bother to make sure things work properly on a PC.There's also several showstopping bugs that can occur, blocking progress in the game. One of them is a basic error in the controls configuration file, but EA being EA hasn't bothered to fix any of the issues.Avoid it.			"

												Although i really love Alice and her Wonderland stories/movies this game is really bad because of the gameplay. Its control sucks, the movement of Alice sucks big time, you have no full control to where she will jump she often falls for no reason from cliffs. Tha targeting system also sucks big time it really doesnt help at all if you are facing a lot of enemies. That graphics are OK, soundtrack is really good and the story i cant say that it is bad. Seriously though, the controls-gameplay are sooooo BAAAAAD that it almost makes this game unplayable at some times. Not worth it unless you love the Wonderland saga and you are extremely patient because the gameplay of this game will test your nerves			"

												I had hope for this title. I originally picked this up on sale after seeing a friend play through a level or two and thinking it looked like a relatively fun platformer, and it helped that I am also a fan of the multiple variants on Alice in Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass. But after playing through the entirety of the story mode and reaching the game's conclusion, I was more than happy to be done with it for good.The plot wasn't too complex, though I did wonder if there was anything in the first game that I had missed out on. The story flowed rather well through each of the levels and interludes between them, following Alice as she walks the line between the real world and Wonderland, trying to find out why her visions of Wonderland persist even after she's supposedly ""cured"" by her psychiatrist. The art style of the levels themselves is fantastic, bringing life to the eccentric and often gruesome aspects of both Wonderland and 1875 Victorian London. Even the combat and platforming elements had a little flair to them, with varying puzzles, multiple different weapons and tools, a triple jump and glide ability, and enemies that follow certain patterns during a fight, but can be defeated in a number of ways.However, I felt the problem with the game was a lack of diversity in platforming elements and puzzles. Platforming didn't get that much more difficult from the start of the game to the finish. Some portions of levels seem like reskins of sections contained in older levels, and though a few of the puzzles were unique, at least half of them were revisited throughout the course of the game. Though the first few hours playing the game were fresh and entertaining, it quickly devolved into seeing how quickly I could finish the rehashed bits of the levels to attempt to move on to something new. There was a level of progression that just wasn't there. It got rather boring fairly quickly, and the repetitiveness of the game is most definitely the main cause of that for me. (The addition of requiring activation through EA as well as Steam was also quite frustrating, as sometimes the game was rendered unlaunchable for periods of time.)Unless you're a diehard fan of either Alice in Wonderland, American McGee, or both, I would not recommend picking up this game.

												Do not buy this game, pirate it instead if you really want to play it.Do not make the mistake of accidentally supporting EA.The scenery is excellent, and the art designers did a great job.Gameplay is extremely similar to Assassin's Creed and Devil May Cry.The combat is fluid, but the system is implemented badly, and loss of ""focus"" is frequent.The storyline is average at best, and character development is mediocre.Area progression is very linear with only very minor deviation from The Path.The soundtrack is terrible, and half the game is literally a 5 second loop of monotonous annoyance.Bugs are frequent, but usually not gamebreaking, although one of them almost completely blocks the main menu with literally a < 1 FPS, but luckily once past it will allow the game to be usable.You will need the product key steam gives you, but EA's nonsense is as usual too stupid to understand product keys through steam.You must first be forced to reset your Origin account details since steam is forced to open Origin dialog, then after you are forced to open the Origin website, and then go in to your account settings to add a game for some inane reason, and after that it will take a few tries to get them to actually accept your legitimate product key. Once your account is reset and your key is accepted, you will then only need to relog into Origin every time you want to play this.This would be a positive or average review if not affiliated with any of EA's nonsense.

												I have mixed feelings about this game. While I loved the first game, and I was looking forward to this one. However it just doesn't attach itself to you as much. And after a while you just get tired of it. On a positive note, the graphics are much better and McGee's imagination is still quite active. But it's lost on a clunky game engine and bad design patterns that ruin the experience. I'd have enjoyed the game much more if not for the bad engine and design. It's got most of the charm of the original Alice but you wouldn't like this one if you did't play the original. For example (spoiler), you get to see the mechanical version of the Mad Hatter, but you're never told why he's like that. They just assumed you knew that from the first game. It doesn't help that it feels like it's just a retelling of the first game (note: I haven't finished the game yet). The first few stages let you get a feel of what the original Wonderland felt like, just like the first game. But they take you into the new Wonderland way too early and they show you what the new version looks like without you getting attached to the original. Unfortunately, the game doesn't have enough charm to keep you playing for long. If you didn't pay the first before this, I suggest you start there. You'll enjoy this version more if you do that. If you did play the first, you could pick this game up on sale, but paying full price for it just doesn't feel right for me.			"

												Not very original set of monster, most of them uses the concept of No-Face from Spirited Away. I feel that the game can be a lot enjoyable using other depiction than shooting baby face, shooting hearts. I don't even feel that it belongs to puzzle category, all the areas are directed by cinematics and chalk markings. It becomes a second nature to shrink to find these hints. Annoying camera lock whenever the floor button is triggered. Combat is terrible especially when you had to use cap lock. In the combat mode, you keep facing the primary target and you can't jump! When dodging, it kept running towards target then running away. Camera just stuck there and you cannot see other targets around. Monster health feels like counter as the number of hit required is almost the same as the upgraded weapon. I ended the game with 1.2k tooth and all upgraded weapon. More consideration should be taken, 4 levels of weapon definitely not enough. In short, I didn't enjoy playing this game at all			"

												The only nice thing I will say, is that the art direction was well done. With that said, on with the rant...The very first problem with this game is the ridiculous EA Login to verify the game. This alone would have prevented me from buying the game if I'd checked/been warned. The level design is maddening. Keeping track of secret cubbies to collect memories was headache inducing. At times, I felt like the whole point was to collect memories and teeth, but luckily for me, the previously mentioned level design made that close to impossible to collect them all on the first go, even being extremely careful. Not that it matters since this game lacks achievements (GRRRRRR!) The Voice Talent was weak. The main character comes off as spineless, which in this specific story makes her unlikeable. Talking about story, for a game this mediocre, a good story keeps people playing, but there wasn't even that to enjoy. I found myself wishing Wonderland would just be nuked into oblivion, just so that she'd stop whining.I constantly felt like I was being sent on fetch quests, except when these happen in other platformers or MMORPGs you at least get some level of satisfaction for completion. Not in this game. Unless your goal is to subject yourself to a Tim Burton-esque Mediocre Platformer, stay away from this game.			"

												Hi guys! Well I've been playing Alice: Madness Returns for now 17 hours and I've just begun the fourth chapter, I would have prefered to finish it before publishing my opinion about it but I can't help warning you now, all the more since if you've played the whole first chapter you can consider you've played the whole game...A few months ago a friend of mine showed me the trailer, saying ""Look! A dark version of Alice In Wonderland!"" and I was like ""ahmagad I must get it!"", and it was indeed the first game I bought on Steam. I was about to regret it very soon.First impression, I was amazed by the universe and the landscapes, and more than anything the representation of madness and the new interpretation of Alice, which keeps the main elements of the Carrol's version. Let's be honest, the cathedral train, the steam punk-like chapter, etc, were pure artistic genius. I was also pleased with the gameplay, which I found pleasantly fluid, and was a good point for me as I'm a beginner with PC games. The fights were cool, in short it seemed to be a really cool game.But now I'm in chapter 4 and I promised myself I would finish it, but my word, I'm so bored! I've never played a so boring game in my whole life! It is way too repetitive, seriously, it seems like they kept the same paterns through the complete game and juste changed the skins. You almost always fight against the same three or four kinds of ennemies, who never get harder, and in each level you have a puzzle that can be solved by an eight-year-old kid, a long slide where you can catch more teeth (the sort of money you use to improve your weapons) and platforms, platforms everywhere, moving platforms to make it more difficult to reach, just like in games for children - and I know what I'm talking about, I played Monsters & Cie on PS when I was six and there were all these elements. It's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D platform game (and I hate 3D platforms, I die more often by falling than in the battles) dudes !I still play Alice to relax when I'm tired but the developers have been really lazy (except the ones who created the graphics), I'm really disappointed and I think you'll be too. A beautiful wrapping but definitely empty... "

The story is very wayward, basically just a chain of being told to talk to different members of wonderland, each of whom asks you to help them, and then welches on their promise to help you in favor of telling you to talk to another.

												Well, why? The storyline seens confuse, you cant say what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, and all the mistery comes ends what you already suspects. I'm not going to spoil nothing, but is not surprising.The combat system is kinda fun, but masive. I completed on Normal, It is okay, cool, and not challenging, not cool. The engine fails in some points, It is Unreal Engine 3, one of the best engines in the world, but the developers tried some minigames what causes some fps drops. And the most minigames are skipable and annoying.The only thing what is really good in that game is the Soundtrack, fits perfects for each combat.3/10, would not bang again.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game. It does have a great athmosphere and setting. The story seems okay. That's where good ends, unfortunately. The gameplay is quite repetitive, and a lot of the originality that was in the first part is missing. The controls are absolutely awful (console port, yay). Playing the same part over and over, not because it's hard, but because the controls make you do something else than you wanted is terrible. Even aiming with the mouse is so nasty, that they added a key to focus on an enemy. Obviously you'll always focus on the wrong one, and you have to tab through them to even shoot in the right direction. With some of your moves (that more or less chain together involuntarily) you can't control where you're going, so expect walking into enemies, or not being able to get away while shots fly at you.So - if you like to have that console gaming feeling on PC (press random keys and restart until you win), give it a go. Otherwise, stay clear.			"

												I would give this game a 2 out of 5 and would recommend it only to teenage girls. Why: I love the characters and the graphics/design of Wonderland are really neat. But the story is just a joke, as is the ending (if you make it that far).The other thing is the gameplay, which repeats itself after the first chapter. Then it's always the same: slaying some enemies, solving some very easy riddles and jumping across Wonderland.Too bad, because I love Alice in Wonderland and still think that this game yields great potential! But if you're 15, female and the Steam Sale is on: grab it, I guess you'll like it anyways!			"

Also, the ending leading up to the final conclusion felt a little rushed; and my impression was that it was not only unpolished, but perhaps unfinished.

When I try to create a new account, it says I am already signed up to EA games, I have tried 5 different email addresses and it just says the same.

												Why do I play console ports? They are so often frustrating like this game. The controls are mushy and imprecise; the camera causes problems in fighting, and the save points are so poorly chosen that I have twice immediately quit out after restarting the game because I discovered I had to re-play a section that I had completed before quitting (there are no manual saves because this game's save system sucks). I really love the Alice stories and the gothic spin is great, too, and I remember enjoying American's first Alice game. But the gameplay here is frustrated by the controls, the camera and a save system so bad as to render the game an unwelcoming chore. Mushy combat coupled with wonky camera and jumping/timing puzzles; fun! The voice for Alice is a bit off, too, but that is so minor a complaint I feel bad making it. Damn it, I really wanted to like this game.That's it; I'm boycotting EA games. Not just because they are evil but because their games just frustrate me more than the reviews would indicate. I used to deduct 20% from a game's rating when it was made by EA but now I'm just going to assume the reviewer was paid off or played the game in one two-hour sitting. Oh, and the intro movies last forever. You can edit the files to get to the start screen about 20 seconds quicker but this the 21st century, we should be past that.			"

												I wanted to really like this game, I did. I came into it after hearing some of the negative reviews and thought, ""Well all the negatives they stated probably won't bother me"" because they were all about dated graphics and whatnot and I really don't care about that. I thought the game was actually quite beautiful at times and I enjoyed the graphics and art style for the most part. The biggest issue I had with this game is it just overstayed its welcome. While the story was interesting (I enjoyed the slower story moments the most) there was just way too much that didn't progress the story at all and just had you doing the same basic tasks over and over. You'd do some platforming, fight some bad guys, find some secrets, then repeat. There are a few different enemies, and new enemy types come in over the course of the game, but once you figure out each enemy pattern the majority are relatively easy to fight, if you can get the lock on to work that is. The lock on system works for simple enemies, but when faced with a boss it tends to hurt you rather than help you. The lock-on camera is locked in a position so if you move around an enemy you'll find yourself having to turn it off just to let the camera fix itself, or else you'll dodge straight into an enemy attack. Other than the lock-on feature, the combat is generally pretty fun for awhile, it just gets old once you fight the same enemy type over an over for a few hours. The game is also pretty linear, other than a few secret areas (which are for the most part are all reached the same two ways). You'll find yourself going exactly where the developers want you to, with invisible walls blocking anything that may look like a chance of exploration. The invisible walls contribute to my last major gripe, the game feels clunky and outdated. This includes the animation, controls, and mostly platforming. Alice can't climb edges, so if you make a jump and just one toe is below the platform, ledge, etc. you wanted to get on, you plummet straight to your death.All in all, I wanted to recommend this game, at first I was very content but after awhile the feeling died down and I found myself playing it just to beat it. The game does have a good story, and the art style is pretty cool, but everything else is just overly monotonous and extremely disappointing.			"

												Eerily atmospheric game with a cool art style and story. The gameplay itself good as long as you still collect new weapons, but after around 10 hours maximum the game doesn't seem to progress any more and becomes boring. Also, there's a lot of glitches, non game breaking and game breaking ones that, just as one example, keep you stuck in a long fight that you already finished (forcing you to reload). It's also locked to 30fps. I can't recommend it on that basis, but if you're not to bothered by the above you can give it a shot; it's certainly a memorable game.And as always: only available on windows, not on linux.

												Honestly, don't get this game full price unless you REALLY, REALLY love repetitive platformingHere's the game in a nutshell, Shrink to find your way around, once you find where to go, practically glide across the map in order to get to the next platform. Put a bomb on a switch, something activates, go along from there. There's not much variety when it comes to the platforming mechanics other than jumping and gliding. Nothing more. Combat: The combat is ergh... Kinda rage inducing without a controller towards the end of the game considering 2 monsters will be attacking you and requires a lock on just to deflect incoming boulders ripped from their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I'd rather deal with batmans lackluster combat than this game. Platforming: Already told ya above ^ Puzzles: The puzzles kinda correlate with the platforming sadly enough. There are a few ACTUAL puzzles you have to put together throughout the game and they aren't that challenging... Just don't overthink it and you'd be fine. Story: My version... Short and Sweet. A girl named Alice that has a ♥♥♥♥ed up mind from losing her parents in a fire when she was young, now she's trying to figure out how the fire started...Pretty lackluster story right? Yeah, I thought so too. Final Verdict.... Don't buy this game unless you have an obsession for jumping and gliding, if not. I recommend something like rayman... That's actually decent.			"

												The control scheme would work if the game did not come with EA DRM that you have to externally ""authenticate"" using your DNA and a retinal scan, mouse smoothing that ensures the precision you are probably used to is stripped away for the console controller auto-aim (would not be needed if they did not implement the terrible controls to begin with, and the frame rate smoothing that ensures no matter how fast your system is, the game will visually lag. Yes, all in one run-on sentence, because while this second Alice game may have been awesome, the developers sold out.I watched another play quite a bit of it and started playing it on my own PC now, but I see why he kept yelling at the controls.

It's worth the playthrough.			"

												Only one of hour of game time and I am quite satisfied. This platform game has all the essentials of a world full of physical oddities. You can defy physics and gracefully do so. This game does not only have a colorful Moulin Rouge quality but the game play is challenging and interesting. I am interested to find out how the collection of memories in the storyline will be used to develop the story and how they will be useful.			"

												Amazing, I haven't finished it yet, but it was amazing so far. Glad I got it for the Halloween sale, saved a bunch of money. It is an amazing sequel but I haven't played the first game, but still amazing. I can't stop playing. I'm using the word amazing too much, right? AGH, I did it again. Okay, simply two words, get it. Although it might be easier to install on Origin. I don't know... This game starts dreary and dull then you get sucked away into a very messed up Wonderland when you go deep enough. Different monsters at every corner, making pig snouts sneeze. If that sounds like your kind of game, get it. Although it may not be the best to everybody, if you can handle dreariness and fighting, erm, weird things, that are slightly disturbing, you should be fine.			"

												this is my first time playing McGee's Alice, and from my opinion i would give the game 8/10. First impression was good art design in levels(didn't like sea level design), it's gorgious how mix of steam punk and a bit ghotic(Tim Burtoun style) in it give beauty to it. Second, story is very interesting and original, you can see Alice's memory come together one after another which is rempresented in game by a collosal train. Combat system is simple and a bit boring, click click click, shift click click etc. i would really like some combo attacks to be added in game to make it more interesting. Now my biggest issue is lenght of specific levels (3 especially) that can take 2-3 hours to complete and after some time on SAME level it gets a bit boring and you keep saying to yourself ""omg is there end to this godamn level). Puzzles are somewhat challenging and other can be frustrating because you have little time to finish them. Now about charecters... Alice here is one BAD MOTHER***** who came to destroyed Wonderland to restore piece and show who is boss here, you will love Alice after you start with levels. All in all i can say the game is amazing but could have been a bit shorter on some levels.this is my 1st review hope you liked it :)			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is very much a retro-styled title in terms of gameplay, which will turn many people off right away.  The floaty and imprecise platforming is sure to discourage the uninitiated.  The easiest way to review it is to put it in terms of it's previous title.  Did you play American McGee's Alice?  No?  Wait for a steam sale so you're not too disappointed if you hate it.You did play AMA?  Did you like it?  No?  Skip this title completely.  Chances are very good that you were turned off by either AMA's floaty platforming or American McGee's childhood destroying storyline.  Both are still in full effect here.  Even though the jumping physics have been tightened up a bit, it is still frustrating at times.You did like AMA?  You love it, and you're one of those rabid fans that did a happy dance when you found out that your favorite (only?) gothic absurdist horror title was finally getting a remake?  (Yeah, I'm one of those.)  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  BUY MADNESS RETURNS!  NOW!  YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT!Hope this helps.			"

												The game looks absolutely beautiful. Everything from the artwork, level design and animations just look phenominal. Each area really has its own beauty and unique atmosphere.The story is interesting, with lots of colorful characters and more than a few twists. Alice takes quite a few very dark turns as she explores her imagination to escape her real life problems.The gameplay is good although a little on the easy side, with a spammable invincibility move later on. There are a fair share of weapons, some feel better than others, but they all follow the Alice theme pretty well. The platforming and puzzles are pretty standard, nothing super innovative here but still good.Overall the game is good, with only a few hangups. For example, the non combat areas can be a bit restrictive and linear. Would say its a solid fit for anyone looking for an action platformer with a little madness.			"

												I like this game very much, the story is interesting, chracters are interesting, grahphics is nice, fps is nice. But I do have lot of complains, I believe the problem is caused by developers laziness.First off, the bloody fps is locked at 31 fps, you have to unlock it vida config file. Why locked at that kind of fps?? This is the clear sign of poor console port. The games also contain some annoying bugs, during one of the section, you are granded an umbrealla for blocking the enemy, however, the button won't work at all, you can't block no matter which button you mapped to. I follow the intruction to solve it, but that does not work for me, luckily there is other way to defeat the enemy. You will also have to edit the config file to access the dlc items, why not allow user to use it at the beggining ffs. The game have some camera issues, luckily that does not happen often. Some of the paltforming is kind furstrating as well due to not so perfect jumping mechanic. The game does get a little bit repeatetive, recommended take some rest or else you might starting to hate this game. The graphics menu is a bit limited, only contains AA, Shadow, physx and post processing. You will have to change the rest of the graphics like AO, via config file. Physx looks really good, but as always, kill your fps like crazy, even for Nvidia users, if you have a gpu that barely makes 60fps, recommended to turn this option off.			"

												An excellent action-adventure and platforming hybrid game with a decent story to boot.  Alice is a recovering PTSD patient after losing her family in a fire.  Trying to regain sanity and piece together your broken pysche, you take reoccuring trips to your broken Wonderland, and hack and slash any opposition.  The combat is fast and furious, with several clever weapons to aid you with different abilites.  This is a very fun game for the adventurous!			"

												Please do not spend money on this game it is CHOK FULL OF GLITCHES. You can fall through moving platforms by just standing still, the game sometimes thinks you're running when you're not and you have to push the opposite direction to keep from moving (using a controller fixed this for me tho), every time you pull a lever or turn a valve Alice glitches out and jitters around for several seconds. I've read people saying on the forums too that there are game-breaking glitches where an enemy you need to fight to advance won't show up or is unkillable but I never played far enough in to experience that before I couldn't take it any more. The game's main redeeming quality imo is that it is VERY pretty. Just go find a lets-play to watch and don't waste your money. That's what I'm about to do.			"

												Madness Returns tries to do something interesting. And there are hints of effort everywere. The game shines in the visual design of the horrobly bleak london and the fantastically bleak wonderland. But everything else is just a mess.The gameplay is very remicent of the early 2000's, which basically means ""jump puzzles"". A lot of jump puzzles. Most of the gameplay is navigating levels that become emptier and longer the farther you advance in the game. And the scenery quickly stops being inspiering and intruging, becoming repetetive and numbing.There's also combat. And it too is antiquated. Auto-lock is cumbersome and unresponsive, the camera struggles to keep both you and the target on the screen. It really feels like something made early into the 3D era. Other then that, the combat works. It's very traditional, no surprises and when you are not fighting the camera it can be even fun.The level design is really where it all falls apart. Levels are so long they are tedius, and the game struggles to creat clear story objectives. Until the final level just gives up and your only motivation is reaching the next chek point.The game as a whole feels unfinished. The controls feel loose and invisible walls become more and more prominant. The ending level sends you to wander through a long empty corridor that feels like an unfinshed level. Other wierd instances include a boss that defeats itself as soon as it appears and alice changing her outfit when growing into a giant.The story suffers from being a sequel. Basically it has to use the same tragedy the previous game used. It tries to throw some intrigue into the mix. But it does it all with too broad a brush. Everyone around Alice are corrupt, abusers or down-right evil. It makes the world feel like a characature rather then wonderland fufiling that role. Beacuse the game is so long, you figure out the plot hours befor the twist is revealed in full. And you have to spend the last few hours humuring the story as it tries to build suspence and surprise.In short. It's a game that needed to be trimmed or filled.			"

												Dear god why didn't anybody warn me about this game? The story is promising and the humor up my street, but it's unplayable! Abysmal graphics for a 2011 release only surpassed by dreadful performance and topped of with horrible camera movement. In a bit more detail the graphics themselves look like the game's ported from playstation 2 (two), the performance feels like they ported it without ever playtesting it. It runs smoothly, then suddenly stutters, then runs again. Even cutscenes are affected. Mostly arrives after you get the ui presentation for new weapons or moves. Lastly there's the issue with controls. In the 'tutorial' you get told to press T to enter 1st person mode (even if you've already done so by the way), but every time you look at something and press c it'll take you to 3rd person mode again. Later when you aim the pepperspray using T (gone is the first person mode now) intuitively (sarcasm) you'll have to rightclick to use it and left click to exit aim mode. The list goes on. Basically it is a potentially good story built into a horrible gaming platform. You'd be better off finding a video with the cutscenes on youtube than actually enduring the gameplay yourself. I know the game was only €5 but it's not even worth that. Makes me sick to think that I gave EA money for another piece of beep.			"

They could have easy made this game without putting the alice tag on it but wouldn't have sold as many copies. The 1st alice was more of a puzzle game were this one is more platformer.

												Absolutely asinine controls, designed with a controller in mind. The mouse emulates the controller, even though Unreal Engine 3 comes with native mouse support. Devs were either too lazy or too restricted by deadlines to implement proper controls. There's huge amounts of mouse acceleration and mouse smoothing all over the game, which ini tweaking simply cannot fix.Controller seems to work decently. All around the game is pretty decent, but that does not help if you can't control your character properly.			"

												Editting this because I just remembered that this game has some bugs with the controls and you may have to edit the config files to get it to work, also if you are using mouse and keyboard you may notice some minigames won't work if you also have a controller plugged in at the same time. This is a 3rd person action gamewith some easy puzzle elements. Most of the gameplay is fighting and jumping around. I thought the story was pretty good for this type of game, but most of the puzzles were very simple i.e. put a timed weight one switch and then traverse to a platform that just appeared. There are a lot of mini games that make the game play more diverse, but my biggest gripe is the game is too long and once you learn the game play and upgrade Alice's health and weapons it get's boring pretty fast. If you're like me you'll be wishing it was over by chapter 3 or 4. The levels themselves don't offer much variety, just seems like they were retextured for each chapter. You'll encounter the same things in each chapter, floating platforms, invisible platforms that appear when you shrink, boxes you can smash for health/currency, a bunch of things to collect.  Compared to games like Banjo Kazooie or even Mario 64 it's a let down. At least in those games each world felt unique with it's own challenges and distinct level design..			"

												Almost pretty good. Great art direction and setting, lots of creepy weird stuff but the gameplay is incredibly repetitive and annoying...and this may be an odd criticism but the game is way too long...chapters just go on and on with you doing the same thing over and over and the combat controls can be very annoying with the camera as your most dangerous foe.The one genuinely fun part of the game (rampaging as a giant Alice) is buried at the end of Chapter 4, and just doesn't make up for all the doll head rolling and platform moving puzzles. on a scale of 1-5, I'd give it a 2.

The game does lag on low-medium power PCs though. If you have a high quality rig I would give it a shot. I would suggest waiting until a sale so EA gets less of your cash.			"

												Character design and graphics and  are interesting, but gameplay is below standards. Mouse speed is too fast in gameplay, but to slow in menu's. Fighting is too repetive, and enemies respawn too often. But the most irratating is that this is mostly a platform jumping game and jumping in this game is very difficult (at least at first). When you miss a platform you will need to start over or reload a checkpoint. That's not fun...			"

												I wanted to play and like this game.  Played it halfway, and it's not so good.  The game is way too long,  I dumped in about 8 hours and I'm still not finished; that's a bad thing considering what the game actually is.  A literal platformer that has you jumping across some big and some not so big gaps.  You can find hidden ""memories"", but they just make the game take longer.  Every 10th-20th platform has a few bad guys that are going to be the same from a pool of about 5 different ones that are unique to that chapter and fighting them just makes you feel like you're being slowed down, because fighting them doesn't give you anything, the upgrades in the game come from collected teeth (coins). The visual style is almost enough to make it worth it, the different chapters do look very cool, the game is polished and runs smoothly, but it has a fatal flaw: I'm playing this game with a controller and there is no camera movement that reorients the camera as you move.  Every time you want to look a different direction, you have to move the camera yourself with the R-Stick (Xbox 360 Controller).  This can be very problematic when you have a series of 5-10 platforms that you need to land on serially without stopping; if you don't plan the angle of the camera around the jumps you'll make, you'll die (3 falls and you have to go back to a checkpoint, which can be 10 minutes worth of play).  Most 3d games since Super Mario 64 have some sort of camera assist in this fashion, but not this one.I really wanted to like this game, but there are just a few too many problems and I have too many games where I know these things aren't an issue that I have lined up to play.  Maybe I'll finish it another time after having read one of the guides online on how to fix the camera, but not now.			"

												Stunning. Absolutely stunning. It's been a long, long time since I've played a game that left me baffled at the level design this much. Every new area I entered, I always had to look around a bit first, literally making me go 'ohh' and 'aah' at most occasions. This whole game is just so incredibly lovingly crafted. There's so much detail to everything. I can't even wrap my mind around it. The game play it self is nothing special, but it works just fine. Target lock is a bit shoddy at times, but you'll manage. The dialogue might be a tad bit pretentious, but that actually fits the game's style. But really, this game is a bloody gem. A floating island of gold in a sea of mediocre crap. I've never played a game like this.			"

												Just looking at the world of Alice: Madness Returns, it’s a place where you want to explore, meet the crazy characters and reveal the mysteries. Unfortunately the world has been used to create a game of endless jumping across moving platforms followed by mediocre battles against the same enemies. There is a certain draw in seeing what’s next, but it’s put to rest when you are killed by a foe the camera decided not to show you and you are forced back to a point before you made a dozen jumps across an infinite void.

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. But I just can't. I'm a platform, adventure game, controller friendly gal but this...THIS...is nothing more than an excercise in pure fustration. It ceases to be enjoyable about a half an hour in. Once you complete Chapter 1, it's all down hill from there (I've decided to quit part way through Chapter 5). Yes it's a pretty game. Yes it is a dark, interesting twist on Alice in Wonderland but any positives are outweighed by the sheer agony you will experience trying to play this. It's not even challenging just repetitive, annoying, and unnecessarily difficult. The only reason I've sunk so many hours into this game is because I'm stubborn and really enjoy Alice themed things, usually. I was also curious to finish the story but guess what? That's what YouTube is for. Hopefully one day some developer will make a decent dark Alice game. I strongly urge you to wait until that time. The only way I would reccomend this game to anyone is if they were my enemy and I wanted to hit them with an extreme dissapointment/money wasting combo shot.			"

												An intriguing concept and beautiful art design are unfortunately marred by this game's unimaginative game play, repetitive levels, sub-par voice acting/scripting and pointless collectibles. The story could have been interesting if it were better expanded upon by fleshed-out side characters or just better written dialogue. The weapons all pretty much work the same way, and the controls  (in combat especially) are wonky and frustrating. If taken to the level of the Bioshock series, this could have been a dark, bloody, beautifully atmospheric take on Alice in Wonderland. And seeing what Bioshock was able to do, even with some of its samey weapon choices in the first installment, the story was scary and deeply engaging. It would be best to simply buy the art book for this series rather than waste time on the game itself. You'll get all the pretty, without the inanity, repetition and occasionally horrible psuedo-British accents.			"

												I was eager to play this game. A few friends of mine told me that i would enjoy it. Well maybe on console.Before i even start, i'll give you an advice. Dont play this game without a controller. the aiming system is so bad it manage to give me cancer despite i dont smoke. And since switching ennemies is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥while dodging things thrown at you with a keyboard, sometimes u might lose your cool :)So let's get started. I really loved the story, the sound effects/voices/musics were all perfectly on point, the environnements were really well inspired, i guess that's why at first i was ""whoaw, what a great game, i'm going to enjoy it"".Then it started. ""What's started?"" asked the audience. ""I started to feel the something was odd, sth was foul in this world. I could feel the pain getting in my fingers. What's this? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and inputs not taken in count? Multipled bugs? aw♥♥♥♥♥♥feelsbad man"".Furthermore, the gameplay is lazy as ♥♥♥♥. As if beeing pretty bad wasnt enough, there is also no combo, no aerial attacks... nothing. Empty. Sometimes when u jump and dodge, ur dash goes the wrong way :)I'll finish with the graphics. It's ugly. Very ugly. Released in 2011, the game's ugly and the optimisation is bad as hell. I couldnt run physx with a high end computer bought in 2014. 60 fps when there's nothing on the screen, 30 fps when i start killing mobs and spit goo on the floor.As a story telling game, it's great. As a game you're supposed to play, it's bad.I cant recommend it. I would have if the game had lasted for 8 hours. Yet, i had to endure the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls for something like 12 hours, and it really ruined my experience. I can understand why people are so fond of this game, but i just cant let the poor gameplay slip. It's a video game, not a movie.			"

												Absolute, most boring game ever.So glad i waited for the sale. This game starts off okay then turns to absolute trash after the third chapter. Literally, there's about 3 hours of nothing but platforms and small fights between story bits. It's just a mindless grind just to get to the next cutscene. I'm about to say screw it and just watch the rest on youtube, its getting to be so damn boring.			"

I can not get through to anyone.So now I am stuck with this crappy game that I dearly wanted to play.WARNING WARNING DO NOT PURCHASE !!!!I am not the only victim.I have an EA acccount and I've checked it.

The characters are purposely disguisting, and the developers did a great job overall.The beginning is interesting as well as the storyline, and a very entertaining game to play.But other than different looking levels and random new enemies it got really boring and repetitive quickly since all you do is the same fighting technique over and over.Way too long, and way too boring.4/10 "

												Things that were once acceptable and the norm in game design now completely ruin games for me. Take the Alice game. Awegame. Dark, twisted, adult Alice in Wonderland 3D action platformer. However, once I made it to the Eyepot place the flaws revealed themselves. You fight what appears to be a boss type teapot creature. Beat him and you move onto another teapot with an extra bad guy. Beat that and you move onto two teapots and more extra bad guys. Die on any one of these parts and do the entire thing over again. Really. Lazy game development. I hate when devs take the short cut of just adding more of the same tough enemies instead of presenting the player with new looks and new mobs. And having a player start over from the begining of the routine every time they die seems like such an unneccessary aggrovation in this day and age. And this is just one primary example of this type of design in the game.I would love to have an open world Alice in Wonderland game with exploration. This story and world calls for it. I knew this wasn't it before I bought it but it is extremely linear. You can not even access the entire linear area with so many invisible walls.I do not have the patience with this type of thing like I did when I was 9. My free time is valuable and I'm not going to waste fighting more and more teapots only to be kicked back to the start for one slip up. I wanted to like this game. It has a lot of good qualities but ultimately this is what ruined it for me.			"

												If you are thinking of buying this game. read at your own risk. there are spoilers ahead.and before you read and think ""huh you are stupid, the game is totaly different from the movies and books. me caveman"" note that I am aware that this game is a lot more ""vulgar"", ""horror related"" and ""gory"" than the rest of the series.this game... oh this game. I can write so much about his game.Let's start with what bothered me the most in the beginning: the Voice actress for the main character Alice. the voice in the game was so boring and so unpassionate that it would almost seem like she was narrating the whole time while she was talking. seriously! There is less enthousiasm in her voice then there is in the voice of a narrator of a Wildlife Documentary on Animal Planet.I am a big fan of Alice in wonderland, but never have I seen such a poor portrayal of the characters of this tale.The Mad Hatter for example:The mad hatter is some kind of ""Robotic Goblin like creature"" with his own personal army of ""tea cup wearing Goblins"" and machines shaped like tea pots. and they al live in this giant ""Steampunk like factory city"" (which is beautifull from the outside) the mad hatter also lives here with the Bunny and the Hare which are just a bunny and a hare... but the Hare has robotic steampunk like limbs. oh and they are now the enemy of the Mad Hatter for some reason.that is just an example of one of the awfully portrayed characters.now for something else.. Boss Battles... oh but what is there to talk about? THERE ARE NONE!never in my life have I seen so much awesome ways to make Boss Battles... but the developers are just like ""Meh, cutscenes will do just fine here instead"".example:you arrive to the railroad where you find some kind of weird train that is bound to destroy Wonderland (i'll get back on that later here) and you are together with the Mad Hatter. you came here fighting nothing but ""weird black baby faced blob things"", ""tea cup goblins"", ""hot tea spitting tea pot machine things"" and ""Giant weird black baby faced blob things""when a cutscene starts and I immediately thought ""Awh Yiss! boss fight!"".and then this Giant machine comes up . bigger than what could fit on my screen! i was so exicted at this point... and then what happens you ask? it kills itself..... it just destroys itself..... and then the loading screens starts. Cutscene with weird paper doll things portray what happens. Hatter dies..... and end of chapter.. i just rage quitted at this moment. i continued playing later on but I was so angry at this.the plot is sooooo weird. i must say that portraying Alice as a psychopath crossed my mind once in a while after the movies and such. but that is not the biggest part of the story the game is about this big ""train"" that was made by the immagination of alice and put inside wonderland. this train just goes around wrecking everyone's♥♥♥♥♥♥and then goes on. there are also things in the game that point to some sort of trauma that Alice has. because she was the only one that survived a fire in her home as a child and she wants to know who did it.the cutscenes... don't get me started about those ♥♥♥♥ers. there are kinda good cutscenes in this game. but then you have the cutscenes at the end of every chapter. here you have cutscenes that have paper dolls flay their arms around and where they are bobbing up and down to indicate who is talking. it was just a let down in my eyes.the gameplay mechanics are mediocre. i don't like platformers a lot, but this was really easy especially with the special ""Pre-Order dresses"" that are unlockable by just editing the INI file a little. you have one dress here that gives you the ability to go into some kind of ""extra Bloody Period Sayian mode"" every time you want to. and this makes you invincible. so it's just like activating the God Mode in every other game. this game just tries to be subtle with it's cheating mechanic.the auto save feature just pops up every 12 hours of gameplay or so. if you die at 11:59 playing time they just set you back all that time... JK. but seriously there is no safe feature and the autosave pops op like 4 times every chapter. so when you die you are basically screwed.the monsters are really weird. here are the monsters i have met in my game before I quit the game for goodBlack worm thingFlying screwsBlack baby faced blob thingFlying black baby faced blob thingBigger black baby faced blob thingEven bigger black baby faced blob thing with wheels and flamethrowerTea pot machine that fire hot teaTea cup goblin with spearIce fishBomb throwing ghostCrab with cannons instead of clawsSamurai insectsSamurai insects with bowsBigger samurai insectBlackjack card with spearArmored blackjack card with spearGiant guy with huge axe that is awesome who is killed with a cutsceneDollFlying Dollthat were all the monsters... and what the actual ♥♥♥♥. no wonder Alice is in a mental institution.but there is one thing that makes this game a little bit better. just the one thing that makes it all worth it.. the thing that makes the game so that i will not give it a 1/10 but maybe a 3/10... that is the scenery. the scenery is just plain beautifull some times.so if you play games for just the scenery and views buy this. if you play games for any other reason then don't buy this.i said maybe... my final verdict is 2/101 point for scenery and 1 point for the ""quit game"" button			"

												Completed it and I don't really know what to feel about this. There was a beautiful game called American McGee's alice  where she wrestled with her subconcious and here it just seems a little lazy in areas. The design is very beautiful and detailed, but the story itself insults fans of the origonal game by re-writting a few things for someone to make their own story in reguard to the way children were treated in the time period it's set in. I won't give much away, but that is somewhat of a focus of it, however the ending felt very bitter sweet to me I have to say.I'd only get it on sale and even then, check the steam forums where people have shown how to modify the game code to a much smoother and better working Alice game.

												I had high hopes for this game. I'm a huge fan of Alice in Wonderland, from the original stories to the multiple disney representaions. This game's early Tim Burton-esque art style is beautiful, and the story twists itself into one of surreal horror that caught my attention. But the art style and the story is where this game ends. The platforming is basic jump-here jump-there stuff that takes up way too much time, the combat is incredibly basic besides the fact that you can dodge (the dodging can be satisfying I will admit), and there are small collectibles strewn all over the map for you to collect, a concept that hasn't been cool since the old Playstation 2 days where it seemed like anyone who had collectibles in their game could be published. And that's what this game is in terms of gameplay, it's like an old boring PS2 platformer without the nostalgia. And what I absolutely hate in any game is fetch quests, the kind of quests where you walk into a large room, a character tells you to go grab somethings, and you have to go through multiple dungeons and grab multiple items in said dungeons and bring them all back in order to finally make progress. (I'm talking to you Darksiders 2). As soon as I met the Mad Hatter and his goblin-ugly @$$ told me to fetch his limbs, I exited the game and refunded it. If the developers had used their talents to make an animated movie of some sort, I may have really enjoyed this experience, but as a game it's not worth the time it takes to find four limbs.TL;DR: Great Artstyle and interesting twist on the old story. But the amusement dies after experiencing incredibly boring gameplay mixed with old old platforming tropes, clunky combat, and uninspired-at-best missions. Cannot recommend.			"

												On the plus side, it isn't unplayably bad like the first game, but on the other hand it isn't any fun either. It's just astoundingly mediocre, at least up to the point I played. It also doesn't look anywhere near as good now as the first game did when it was new (which was enough to get me to finish it using cheats), and the idea behind it isn't novel anymore, at least in a game. Some things in it do look rather nice, but then there's random crap that's brown and murky and some disappointing low-res textures that ruin the one redeeming aspect of the game. Mostly it's too much linear jumping and bland combat.			"

												The game looks great the story is fun and interesting and I really enjoyed it at first.  That being said the combat system is horible. They force you to us the FOCUS system to lock on and to block attacks witch would be fine but the camara does not stay behind you it goes all overthe place.  When you dodge you end up not going where you want to even thou you are holding the dierction the crazy camara angle is showing you should move.  It also zooms you in to the taget you are locked onto, but when you are fighting 6+ monsters at the same time you can't tell when you are going to be attack by the others.  I am playing the game on nightmare and when you get hit 1 time it takes half your life 2 times and you die.  There is no room for error but the combat system is so broken there is no way to avoid getting hit when you are constantly not dodging the direction you want to.Lastly the autosave does not happen enough, when you die (and I did alot) you will find yourself redoing large parts of the game just to get back to the place you died.  If the game would autosave before major battles instead of making you replay 15 minutes of parcore and then have to survie the bad combat system it would make it bareble.  In a couple of instances the game saved before you had to load a new zone, so when you died you would have to reload the new zone again, it made no sense. I reaqlly like the game I just can't stand the bad camara work if they locked the camara behind you it would make everthing better. but as it is right now when you are locked on and circleing an enemy the camara view does what it wants.  I am sure if you play the game on normal it wont matter that you can't time your dodges perfect and go where you want to.  I wanted to play the game at it hardest difficulty and when poor combat mechanics are kiling me it takes all of the fun out of the game.			"

												1: combat is boring, predictable.....a bad rip-off of Ocarina of Time.  You have only one defensive maneuver, which looks the same no matter how you do it.  Enemies take advantage of you not having camera control when you ""Z target"" and gang up.2: The atmosphere is gloomy, dark, moody.  It builds and builds and builds up the sense that somewhere, sometime, you'll be fighting something that requires more than just hacking away with your primary weapons....Well, that never happens.  You simply pick up another item/ability and have to spam that to win, instead of being allowed to use other abilities and fight as you want.3: the game stutters, has pop-in, and not all the controls map to a 360 controller...I'm actually stuck in this game and will never finish it because EA is too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lazy to either map one of the items to the controller layout, or allow me to use the keyboard/mouse and controller together.

It is well written, art stye is imaginative, story is good, acting is good (they should have made this a movie).  But every single gameplay element is annoying, boring or tedious.

Its the only way to get rid of him and continue, but as i looked up in the internet, there was not only me having the problem that the umbrella doesnt work. even after restarting, resetting, etc.So, it would be a nice game to recommend, but if u cant keep on playing the story, its really really sad.

												i purchased this because i remember the first alice fondly. this is a good game , very poorly made . im only 20% through it and its painful to play, it was a pain to instal, i really wanted to like this game ,but it's full of bugs , the enemies that are supposed to be easy are hard, the ones that are supposed to be hard are rediculously easy, the combat system is clunky and unpredictable at best.. the worst part is the enemy called ""Ruin"" is supposed to look like oil i guess? but it kills my fps and they are everywhere , I have a computer that runs Fallout 4 seemlessly on ultra settings but it can't handle this? come on ... do yourself a favor and don't buy this . or anything made by EA .

Combat is absolutely dreadfull, with a carema that's all over the place but just not where you need it. Also according to the story this game is all up it's own♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Eleven years ago a horrific fire took Alice’s family from her and left her mind horrifically scarred. Afterwards she was confined to Rutledge Asylum, where she struggled to confront her demons by slipping further into her fantasy world of Wonderland. Now, after ten years, she has finally secured her release—yet she still bears the heavy psychological burden of that tragic event. With her mind in tatters, she is unable to resolve the fear prompted by her strange memories, dreams, and visions. Perhaps she’ll do better in Wonderland. She always has. She travels there, seeking what the “real” world can’t provide: security, knowledge, and the truth about the past. But in her absence, Wonderland too has suffered. Something has gone horribly wrong, and now a great evil is descending upon what once was her beautiful refuge. Can Alice save Wonderland—and herself—from the madness that consumes them both?			"

												****May contain spollers*****As a HUGE Alice fan my husband got me this and I was over the moon omg pleased I could finalerly play something that wasn't all sugar sweet and candy coated.....then came chapter five- THE DOLL HOUSE level....I find this utterly disturbing.. I will only point out three things ..- the ""dolls"" are not only all nude (even some enemies again ""dolls"" require you to strip them and beat them to defeat them) but the doors you need to pass though are loacted in their crouch area both front and back, and the main ""boss"" fight is with a child sex trader who has♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a member of your family and plans to sell you (Alice) as one of his ""dolls""YES IF I COULD I WOULD DEMAND A REFUND AND REMOVAL OF THIS GAME FROM MY ACCOUNT I dont want to ever be linked to this ever again, the whole thing makes my skin crawl, the only silver lining I shall be taking from this, is the fact I can say I've played it and it really is that bad!!!

You gotta protect girl's dream!!!). <=i've spoiled the story a bit aren't i?Things i dont like is a long and boring jumping madness, boring mini games, bugs which really pisses me off when i got stuck in some place and automatically died aaannnddddd repeat a damn jumping madness again till i reached the checkpoint. I personally don't like jumping to get through a chapter. Confusing control. Some hidden stuff that is way TOO MUCH for collecting.I just cant bear to play any further so i went on Youtube and watch the ending instead.			"

												I bought this game only because her jump animation. It was graceful, and I wanted to experience it.And it was a terrible decision, because this game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yes, it is. Here's why:- It's ugly. I don't understad people who say ""this game is beautiful"". Did you even play it? There are no turn animations. She just appears in the require pose if you press w a s or d. This pretty much sums up the game. The whole concept is rough-and-ready, half-made, there are no details, the textures are weird and it's better not to mention the bottom of each level...- It's way too long. After the 2nd hour I immediately felt something's wrong with this game. It became repetitive and boring.  Each level testifies the painful lack of ingenuity. Sliding parts, puzzle parts, some action, then the whole thing starts again. As I started a new chapter I wished to finish it as soon as possible, but it took forever.- The story is simply bad. Didn't read the book, but what the guys at Spicy Horse did is a big mess. There was no excitement and curiosity in me, I always thought: ""meh, wtf, really? etc..."" And don't get me wrong, I have a really good taste regarding stories, but this...- It's kinda hard. I started the whole game on hard mode, but after the 6-7th hour switched back to not normal, but easy, otherwise I'd still playing this crap. It seemed they originally developed this to consoles, and this PC version is just a bad port (I'm 99% sure this happened). The jumps are screwed up, especially in the 2D parts. She stucks in the textures, slips off edges, can't reach what she should. It's very very (very!) frustating.- The lack of upgrades (and mechanism content). You can collect teeth which are the units if you want to level up your weapons. But nothing else! You can't buy health kits, boost stuff, nothing! You have 4 weapons (and a fifth but that's not really a weapon) and that's  it. Each has 4 levels which can easily be reached. Whoa, that's the variety... Your health can be extended, but through more fight. - Which is not even fluent. You can't fight in the air (whaaaaat??), but Alice can jump 4 times! Look at all the missed potentials...In overall, it's boring as hell, gets repetitive right after the beginning and a pain to play. I only played through this pile of mess to write this review. Avoid this game!			"

												I wish, like so many other folks, that there was a 'meh' button.I couldn't play the game at first, because at one point, early in the game, there would be frame drops and then the game would freeze completely. Tried different guides online to make it work, but got the same bug everytime, so I dropped the game. This is apparantly a common issue with Alice: Madness Returns.I recently got a new PC and this time the game worked. Still got the occasional frame drop, but no freezes. But there were bugs, alot of them. Mobs that dissapeared or froze, so I was not able to kill it and thus not able to continue. Had to reload and try again. Weird glitches, delays in actions (I died so many times falling, because my jump was delayed) and a overall ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system, that was sometimes horrible with the above issues. I was too stuborn to give up on this game though. The game itself got more dull later in the game. Repeating the same minigames over and over again. You could tell they ran out of ideas, at least, that was the idea I got.But, I have to say, I enjoyed the art, scenery and story. The different outfits and theme's each chapter was something I was really looking forward to. The story and plot were quite good as well. You have to collect 'memories' and after each chapter there was a conclusion, slowly putting the pieces together. The collecting part (not just the memories) were also fun to do and sometimes a challenge. Especially with all the bugs.So if you can poke through the bugs, enjoy a good story, art and scenery and you are stubborn just like me, try this game by all means. Just prepare yourself for alot of frustations, frustations, frustations.			"

												I've been a fan of the McGee's Alice since the first game came out when I was a kid, although it scared me and I never got very far in that first one. When I saw this one, I had to get it and I absolutely adore it! Much better graphics this time (as is usually the case) and Alice's sense of humor is perfect. Even if you haven't played the first game, you can jump into this one without any trouble.			"

												VS American Mcgee's Alice.Pros : Graphically better, combat has a lockon system, so many abilities, upgradable weapons.Cons : For the console players that can't multitask, there are only 4 weapons and 2 which you can use at one time. After tweaking the controls and settings a little bit since this game is a console port. I found it to be quite enjoyable. Alice goes back and forth between the real world and wonderland instead of being in nightmare all game. It suffers the same jumping flaw as the first game where you could almost call this series nintendo hard because of the jump necessary. This one isn't as bad because you are given a triple jump right off the bat which enables you to correct your jump. The controls are a bit odd, sensitive on freelook so slow on ranged weapons but aside from that this is a pretty fun game.			"

												While this game looks stylish and very artistic it fails to meet my expectations of a modern platformer, I was surprised that the first game had some mechanics that was taken out in the sequel such as being able to grab ledges - which is pretty much expected in a platformer. This lead to many a deaths for me, more so than any enemy did to me in the entire game(estimated 5 out of 60 deaths were from enemies). I also experienced other bugs such as being unable to steer the character properly(clipping, bugged walking, failing to jump etc), which also caused many deaths as I was unable to progress.Storywise, the game is decent but I felt like there wasn't really a red string that tied it all together and instead you are going through all these places with no story attached trying to find bits and pieces to put things together which most of the time I felt like didn't make any sense (but I guess that is the purpose of the game). Sadly this makes the finale very unsatisfying as you don't really get the twist of the story to tie up properly and leaves you in a sort of ""Oh, okay"" as the credits roll by.The game would be fitting for someone that like the typical combo-move battle mechanic and some fair platforming, but if you enjoy games with stories and a bit more quality in terms of mechanics - look elsewere.

I also experienced other bugs such as being unable to steer the character properly(clipping, bugged walking, failing to jump etc), which also caused many deaths as I was unable to progress.Storywise, the game is decent but I felt like there wasn't really a red string that tied it all together and instead you are going through all these places with no story attached trying to find bits and pieces to put things together which most of the time I felt like didn't make any sense (but I guess that is the purpose of the game). Sadly this makes the finale very unsatisfying as you don't really get the twist of the story to tie up properly and leaves you in a sort of ""Oh, okay"" as the credits roll by.The game would be fitting for someone that like the typical combo-move battle mechanic and some fair platforming, but if you enjoy games with stories and a bit more quality in terms of mechanics - look elsewere.

												Late recc but better late than never. I personally loved this game, one of my long awaited sequels, but the game lacks a lot of depth or true plot. What it does make up for, however, are a lot of set pieces done beautifully and creatively with current graphics, with a tone and detail that I found just gorgeous. I was hoping it'd be a lot more twisted and gloom like the original but I think having EA publish the game meant making some changes to have the game more appealing. Another stark change from the original is a fairer, much easier difficulty curve, while the original was really punishing and considerably broken. *spoiler* It's a shame little to no work went into boss battles but it is still fairly challenging at parts			"

												Story and visuals of this game are amazing. Its like art trip where you wont get bored for a second. There is so many magical and clever details, they have really put effort to back grounds and created wonderland and town very well. You can sometimes recognize some visuas that are same in reality and the fantasy and thats so damn cleaver 'oh this founds its way into her fantasy'. and humans look cartoony, they have most likely been drawn before they have been turned into 3D models. and it has made it look so good.but if I have to say something bad. well, those black blob enemies are most common villains in the game, and even that other enemies and characters are done well, those blobs lack imagination and look bit boring. even that in some levels they look out of place (which is good thing because they dont belong in wonderland) but in other dark levels they look silly when the background made of nightmares.also camera is sometimes your biggest enemy. it might jump around and get stuck and you fall to your death because of it. other problems sometimes are jumps. even that all jumps are possible, they arent hard for wrong reasons, you might get stuck to edge and douple, even triple jump doesnt help what so ever. and when camera wants to do what it wants in that situation, you die again. gladly this doesnt happen often (I remember less than 10 times when it would have)third thing was glitches, there isnt many of them but the few are the most annoying that you can get. sometimes enemy doesnt die when it is supposed to. it keeps attacking you or stays on ground screaming. it isnt such important thing in cases where you dont have to kill all enemies to open the door or something. but when  it happens than, it is most annoying. gladly restarting the game helps and auto-save usually gets you to do it again right away. (this happened at least 3 times, so it isnt so big problem)also there is couple times when the paddle which should active stuff, doesnt work. restarting might not help and it does it again. than all the sudden when you have tried it million times it starts to work.if EA would care more about the players than money, this game would been perfect. but when the game gives you satisfying experinse and story like that. I pass the bugs. it isnt worth it to rip hair out of your head for one spot on the blanket.			"

Always loved the Lewis Carroll world of Alice, but the twisted darkness of the American McGee version is wondrous in its own way!Some people complained about the controls on console versions, but I had no issues whatsoever with gameplay... mebbe it's different on PC, iono.  Playing with a 360 controller was easy peasy.			"

												Unbelievably incredible.Worth whatever you have to spend on it.I'm no stranger to platforming games, and this game still had over twenty hours of playtime for me. I've been working overnight shifts, which are usually fairly quiet, so I decided to spend each shift playing this game. Finally beat it today and it was so rewarding. I definitely recommend this to anyone that loves excellent stories, platforming games, or action games (whether you are a fan of Alice in Wonderland or not).			"

												It's hard to believe that this game was released due to the copious amount of bugs. The game glitches a lot. I've had Alice repeatedly glitch through a platform into lava, been stuck using the long range weapon and unable to use the melee, etc.For all that though, I'm really enjoying this game. The artwork is wonderful. The character designs are really well done. The storyline is good. The levels have a singular path through them with hidden areas for collectibles. I hope you like jumping puzzles!It's a very pretty platformer with puzzles.			"

												I don't think I've ever played a game that was a combination of a 3d platformer, riddle/puzzle solver, find all the collectibles, first person shooter, ""if all else fails blow it up,"" side-scroller, and psychological thriller. And while it was really enjoyable for quite a while, it just kept dragging on and on and on. Don't get me wrong, I'm used to extremely long games, but this was so very repetitive. So many jumping puzzles, oh my God. Fifteen hours and four chapters in, I'm still only about 60% through the game. I've had it. I read spoilers to see how the game ended and I'm done with it. It's just too repetitive to be fun.			"

												The pc port is a bit of a fixer-upper. It's locked at 30 fps by default, but that can be easily upped to 60 by editing the game files. There's also a bug that makes one of the new weapons you aquire unusable. This to is also reparable. The game's performance is a bit janky to say the least. There is frequent stuttering, but it never reaches a point where the game is unplayable. Overall the game is very rough around the edges, but I just can't stop playing it.What American McGee and his team at Spicy Horse Games have created is truely something that has to be experienced. The dark twisted vision of Wonderland is both beautiful and grotesque with a great deal of variety in the worlds you visit. The game itself is actually a very solid action platformer. Alice controls well, the platforming is fun, and the brief combat sections are perfectly servicable. The game is a bit on the easy side and it can drag on in places, but the journey is one very much worth taking.			"

												It's a platformer, and I've played enough platformers to be done with the genre. That being said its a pretty damn good platformer. Nothing that'll ""change your life"" but it was extreamly well done. Zelda weapon elements is a fun feature and the CG/story was pretty damn good. REALLY hard on hard mode and normal was a bit of a challenge towards the end (way easy in the begining). I love the dark motif of this Alice! They took their liberties in changing the story (huge Lewis Carroll fan and I don't mind the changes), I wish the original Alice were on steam to play catch up! I haven't fully beat it on PC version but I also owned and beat it on 360 a while back. I've completed about 50% done with the game (PC version that is) and have't found any game breaking bugs or glitches.			"

												This game is beautiful. The definition of Game Design Art, if that even exist. If you were amazed by how Bioshock environments looks then you will get the same feeling here. You'll spend a minute or two in this game pondering about how beautiful the scenery look. Most of my screenshots are now my wallpaper...just putting this in perspective.As far as gameplay concern, it is very casual and simple, but the execution is not bad at all. The combat is fun and there's quite a varible of enemies. You can attack your enemies in multiple ways, and create your own style with the dash and dodge mechanics. There's no regenerative health, so that's a plus. There's lot of platform puzzle include jumping and timing, the good thing is the control is very responsive and smooth.The story will grab your interest as you progress in the game. There's lot of symbolism aspects that explain part of Alice to us and make the connection. And Alice is a very interesting character. And...please...do not try to think that this connect with the Disney Alice in Wonderland story.Overall, I would buy Madness Returns 2 if the same designer make it, because this game is beautiful.

												Blimey. This game reminds me of when I was twenty-three, reading Grant Morrison's Doom Patrol, testing out the parameters of my imagination, finding the crossover between the real world and the technicolour blaze of the interior world. The art direction and general level of disturbing childhood nightmare is just fabulous to look at. Unfortunately it also reminds me of when I was twenty-three because it took about a year to complete this game, or so it felt. Its platforming and combat mechanics are perfectly fine, but the levels are INCREDIBLY long, and monotony sets in, which is a shame given the power of the story and imagery. I would recommend, but if you feel you never need to play a 3D platformer ever again, steer clear.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is very flawed, buggy, and bare bones when it comes to upgrades, but dammit I had a lot of fun playing it! Alice is a amazing character and you can really feel her crumble into insanity! I love how smooth the combat feels and the challenge it creates! Platforming is either hit or miss, sometimes it feels great when your being sky-rocketed into the air from a magic mushroom, getting levitated by a gust of wind, and then slidding down a mountain avoiding obsticles. Sadly, invisible walls, random visual glitchs, poor upgrade system, and much more, holds back this game from being amazing. Also the graphics menu is very limited, leaving much to the imagination... I hope the next installment takes more from the first game than this one. There is much fun to be had though and exploring the multiple different worlds is a unexpected pleassure!Concept: I love the storyline and it feels very unique from other fantasy games! 95/100Graphics: Pop-ins, screen-tearing, low resolution textures and more invisble walls than I can count, holds back Alice: Madness Returns from being perfect. 60/100Sound: Sound effects are fantastic, music is outstanding, and everything sounds very detailed. 95/100Playability: Combat feels fluent, but platforming is poorly done and drags the game down a lot. 70/100Entertainment: Arguably the best part of Alice: Madness Returns is the simple fact that is fun and interesting, and is very unique from most games out these days. 98/100Replay Value: Moderately low.Overall Score: 84/100			"

I'm surprised more people haven't noted this.The game itself is insipid, with interesting art and scenery but lackingan engaging flow.

												Where do I begin at this game? Many players found it to be too linear, but with all the open ended sandbox games available, a linear game can be welcomed so you can focus.This game is (deceptivally) resource intensive. With PysX on and w/out editing a .ini file and/or a dedicated card, prepare for low fps, as this game utilizes maximum PysX. Edit the .ini file and take the fps cap off of 30 and be prepared for eye candy. This is how you do it: http://physxinfo.com/news/5883/gpu-physx-in-alice-madness-returns/. This edit makes the game simply gorgious. PC is the way to play this game as it is meant. Now the story can be a bit melodramatic but very intersting. The music is creepy and alignes with the enviorment. Combat is very much like the Shinobi games for Ps2 w/out chain kills. I found the level designs to be perfect and enveloping, but it is linear. I HIGHLY recommend this game if you are a entusiast, GPU geek, or a fan of well designed and thoughtful games. "

												On one hand, Alice: Madness Returns presents a fantastically imagined vision of Wonderland full of secrets, collectables, and wondrous areas of classic platforming to explore. But through questionable level design, graphical inconsistency, and repetitive gameplay, I was pulled out of the experience more than I would have liked. Alice: Madness Returns is a memorable peek through a flawed looking glass.			"

												Macabre and cryptic, this game takes all the things you like about a hack&slash and improves on them. This game is not afraid to take it old school with jumping puzzles and hidden goodies. At times it feels like it moves a slow. But the incredibly detailed areas change drastically and keep you hooked. Of all the games I own, this belongs in the top 5.			"

												(full review at bleedingedgegaming.wordpress.com)After completing the game, I felt something I don’t often feel: Moved.  More and more these days, I feel this deep, creeping fear that I’m outgrowing video games.  I wonder if I’m just becoming an old curmudgeon when I feel that games used to be better than they are now.  Then a game like this comes along and burns my doubts away.  It proves that this is art and someone does get what I’m feeling and want to make me feel moved.  I hope you’re reading this American McGee, because I get it.  I felt it.  If none of the people who made this game ever profit one dime from it and it’s instead used against them in every future proposal they make to a publisher, I hope they read these words.  Your game gave me hope that gaming still means something.  My opinion may only be read by a few dozen people and not even affect the metacritic score, but I’m giving my best praise and the highest honor we can humbly offer.10/10  Cult Game of the Year			"

												Awesome game, amazing art and visuals, plus in an era of CoD clones it's refreshing to play a good platformer for a change, and the hack-n'-slash portions are also fun.From the playstyle point of view it's probably not unlike other good platformers you've played, but nevertheless fun. There is a clear influence from 90's platformers like banjo kazooie, or spyro, the puzzles and lock-on combat are reminiscent of the n64 zelda games.In my opinion, it was the story, surreal visuals and breathtaking music are what made it really stand out and worth playing.

												This game is a dark twisted take on Alice in Wonderland. I'm not usually one for games with unnecessary gore, but this is the exception. The combat is smooth, story is good and graphics are decent for a game made in 2011 (not comparing it to skyrim though, that game has insane graphics for 2011). Definitely worth the 20 bucks  or you can buy it when its on sale, like I did for 5 bucks.			"

												I actually like this game quite a bit, I SHOULD be more harsh with it, but it's just so damn unique and you can tell that the devs we're really trying to make a great game, that it's hard to dislike it. It's a flawed game because of bugs, pointless, boring minigames that break any immersion you have with the story and (VERY) repetitive gameplay, but the reasons that I don't think this game is so bad are down to personal opinions, for example, I really like theming and art in the game, I also like all of the creative ideas for the weapons and enemies in the game as well as exploring all of the secret areas.Although I like the game, chances are most people won't. Which is why I wouldn't reccommend it, but if you can get it for cheap, it might be worth checking out just once to see if it's your cup of tea.			"

												This is an incredibly beautiful and detailed game, for starters. I was very struck by its beauty first and foremost. It's a fun hack and slash game with a very intriguing story with many layers. The weapons are whimsical and easy to utilize, the monsters are creative and have a wide range of difficulty levels. Overall, I just really enjoyed the experience I had while playing this game. I am a fan of darker styles, and I've always loved anything Alice in Wonderland. I would highly recomend this game to anyone looking for something different, engaging, and beautiful.			"

												I loved this game's predicessor.  American McGee's Alice was one of those games that got me into the platforming genre again after so many years of blander, duller, cartoony collect'em ups.  And for the most part, this sequel did a great job.  The artstyle, the voices, and the general story all melded together nicely.  The world is dark, even in the 'real' world Alice Liddell starts off in.  And the various sections of Wonderland give us a fresh, new look at the gritty, sometimes depressing, and always twisted make-believe land that Alice showed us years prior.  From the lush, enchanting forests, to the hauntingly horrifying dollworks chapters, you get a true sense of awe.Several characters make a return to this game, as you'd hope, and their personalities are true to the previous entries.  Cheshire is still that omnipresent force, goading you on to slice and dice your way to the truth.  The Duchess is still hungry, but for something different this time.  Nurse Witless is still greedy.  Fans will be pleased to see the cast returning, and those that haven't played the first Alice game won't be lost.  Yes, the previous story will be hashed out for those newcomers.As much as I love the story, the characters, and the world they wander, I still cannot reccommend this game.  The second half of the game felt...rushed.  You could really feel that the depth SpicyHorse was going for was lost in the flood of EA forcing these guys to churn out product rather than a masterfully crafted story.  Story-driven cutscenes that filled the early stages of the game become less and less frequent, vanishing all together for very long stretches.  Another glaring issue was that you feel certain chapters stay way passed their welcome.  The levels are padded with uninspired platforming and combat for extended periods, breaking up the monotony only to collect a bottle.  (If you are so inclined.  More on this in a moment.)  You cannot graft a long stretch of platforming onto a level, using the same tricks, throw in a small handful of enemies, rinse and repeat.Another issue is the buggy combat/camera angles.  Being a platforming/action game, you cannot have issues with weapons that are require to fell enemies!  (IE: Umbrella weapon)  With certain enemies, you have to ricochet projectiles back at them to do any damage.  When you can't time this right due to faulty programming, it renders the game unplayable.  As for camera angles, I don't like it when there is not an option to fix the camera angle behind the protaganist, so this is just a personal choice.  But when your camera is so hypersensitive to mouse movement, it is exceedingly difficult to get a bead on enemies in later levels, especially on harder difficulties. Another complaint I had was the lack of ANY achievements.  I have played this on XBox360 and PC.  I know there are achievements in the code, because the console ports had them.  Not including it for the PC versions just seem lazy.  Sorry achievement hunters.  Collecting every last bottle, memory, and beating up waves of enemies without taking damage will not up your achievement counter.  Being as there are no achievements, there are no steam cards, no badges, no fluffy extras.  It's not game breaking, but I always enjoyed those little extras.Lastly, there is no post-release patches to fix anything, which means no customer support if you find a game-breaking issue.  And all the fun extras are locked in the Origin version.  The costume changes, the original game package, if you are looking for those, I suggest purchasing through Origin, because they didn't think enough of Steam players to include them.  (Though, you can unlock the costumes by changing certain lines in your game files)  I understand EA wants to ensure more people use Origin, but not including costumes already included in the game code is just greedy.  I would have understood not releasing the original Alice game, but this just seems like another jerkwad move by EA to demand your money and use of their DRM.TL; DNR:It's a fun romp through the dark Wonderland, but certain issues can render the game much harder than it should be.  Fans of the original will enjoy it, but may feel cheated by the lack of their favorite weapon in the previous title.Personal Rating: 3.4/5Game Worth: $8.50If you must get this, get it through Origin to also obtain the first game.

												I'd definitely recommend this gorgeous game. The storyline is dark and twisted, the graphics are creative and beautiful, and the  enemies are interesting (and exceptionally creepy). If you don't like creepy, then you might not want to invest. The writing is fantastic, and the gameplay is exciting and new. Just overall a great game. It takes a lot of dedication to make it all the way to the end, as each chapter is pretty long. The journey to get there is well worth it. :)			"

												This game is such wasted potential, don't get me wrong this game is fun and I really like it, but it's obvious that it could have been much more.The art direction is gorgeous and the gameplay is pretty responsive, but the problem comes with the level design being extremely drawn out and very repetitive, there are parts were it is obvious that huge cuts were to be made to release this game in time.Because of this the levels were drawn out way beyond their need so the game is 8 hours longer than it needed to be.I'd still recommend giving this game a try, but still kinda disappointing.

Usually I'm not a melee combat lover, but for this title I made an exeption ; ) The story keep your attention focussed and willing to keep playing. I've read online that part III is underway, and I'm looking forward to it. Few points of feedback: Some parts of the game don't run smoothly, no matter what ressolution you play it. It has been made to be playable on consol, this results in a strange feel for the pc. But it doesn't ruin the experience!Overall: great game! great story! great graphics! great music! if you like to puzzle and be amazed by the fantasy of the developers you should play!			"

												Well, here goes. I love this game. It's, admittedly, unpolished. Some of the movement and camera angles are a little awkward. The gameplay isn't particularly deep, and the story, as far as I've gotten (quite a number of hours in, now), is nothing mind-blowing. These are the flaws.That said, the gameplay also reminds me of Force Unleashed without the overly powerful force powers. This is not a bad thing. It works for the game. Dash/jump/slash. Those are the primary actions you'll be performing, with the special addition of shrinking yourself to find secrets and hidden things. Sometimes you'll have things broken up by a minigame, either a challenge area with quizes, combat challenges, etc, or a side-scroller platforming section. The gameplay is simple, but it isn't nearly as repetative as most games, and it's broken up with several different genres. The real joy of the game, though, is the setting and atmosphere. It's unique, and it should be seen in action.			"

												One of the most imaginative, fantastic games I've ever played. Its beautiful visuals - ranging from clean dreamlike through dazzlingly surreal to creepy and dark - are underscored, or, more like, accompanied by a similarly mesmerizing soundtrack (and effects.) The story isn't bad either. The gameplay itself is full of interesting ideas... but the platformer challenges can quickly grow furiously frustrating. (Why, oh why isn't there a button that would let you skip certain bits after you failed them five times in a row?!) And there's no save option, just checkpoints (if I remember correctly.) Anyhow, if you're like me - that is, you _love_ dreamy, surreal, gloomy visuals with matching music -, you'll just grit your teeth and bear it, to get to see and hear what the next level has to offer.TL; DR: Despite the often frustrating platformer challenges, one of my favourite games ever because of its visuals and music.

												I will be the first to admit I was skeptical about buying this game. Despite the numerous good points I had heard about it, I had yet to see any gameplay. That didn't bother me much because I went and picked it up at Game Stop for the PS3. After playing through the game once on the PS3, I was very amazed at what the game had to offer. I was enthralled with the horror that the game had to offer, because it was like nothing I had experienced before. Who would have known that such a childhood story could be twisted and manipulated into this nightmarish game? The storyline was accompanied by fragments of memories that you obtained, which helped add clarity to the complex back story of Alice. This game is by far one of the best games I have played to date, and I have purchased the game again on PC so I can replay through it. I would recommend this game to those who want a change. Alice: Madness Returns offers a big change.			"

												The game by itself is good and worth playing but as a sequel it is rather disappointing.The first game had this... feeling of madness about it, a feeling that this one fails to deliver.I also don't like how lazy the cut scenes and the voice acting are done.As most games this one has its minor flaws, not too many but enough for them to not make a 3th game to continue the story.I would still recommend buying it especially if you get it from a sale.

												The sequel to the first Alice game is well done. Not great but good enough. The platform jumping and enemy fighting gets very repetetive fast and the puzzles only vary in where the platforms and switches are. But thanks to the crazy scenery with lots of twisted things to see, as well as an interesting story to get things going, the game can keep you going for hours and hours before getting too boring. Though very linear, finding the hidden secrets and objects throughout the game to unlock more of Alice's memorys is well done and makes everything more interesting. Give it a try, even if you didn't play the first Alice game.			"

												Very good game like the gfx and i love this Happy place turned to hell ( in a good way ) game mechanics are fun can be a bit frustrating from time to time (useing keybord and mouse) game controller went to heven :( ,I like this type of style and i feel is like Tim Burton mixed with a horror movie so im loving it. Downside though EA really messed this game up as well there are few bugs and glitches that can be a bit anoying and the controller layout for the keybord and mouse in my opinion isnt really optimal defult ( can reconfigure somewhat) .That said my controller has gone to heven and wont return :(((( , but anyways though the few bugs and glitches its still worth playing good storry fun challanges and intresting monsters to fight fun upgrades etc ... Something i should clareify is that the original creator of this game wanted to fix the bugs and glitches but EA didnt let him,So thats why i blame EA for the glitches and bugs.I RECOMMEND IT STRONGLY TO ANYONE THAT LIKE TO HAVE A IN THE WEEK PSYCHOSIS ! Cheers ! PS. My spelling sux so hard my teacher gave up on me :P .			"

This game feautres amazing graphics and landscapes, looks if the game was painted by an artist and magic gave it movement. The story is... well its quit Mad. Gameplay is  awesome, with a few weapons at your disposal. You can slash them, crush them, or just plain fill them with holes. Some work better than others tho. I recommend this game to everyone I know for it is a game that got no attention where it should have.A definite must play, with stunning landscape. 10/10			"

												I watched my brother play this game and it seemed interesting enough for me to decide to buy it. It was a good decision. The game's content is very dark, and at times makes you question even your own sanity. Anyone that is familiar with Alice in Wonderland will recognize ideas and characters here, although this is the dark version of that story, not the happy, bright Disney version. It is very story-driven, but it does not hold your hand, not even at the end. You are left to interpret what is going on and ultimately what happened. The fact that the story keeps you engaged is enough to keep you playing.The areas in the game, as well as the enemy designs, are very dark and at times severely mess with your head (the doll house level at the end really messed with my head, I had to rush through the last part of it). But as well written as it is, and as beautiful and dark as it is, it does suffer from one major flaw: the gameplay itself. The combat is simplistic and hard to mess up, and most of the areas have you going from one platform to another while floating through huge empty space. I did start to notice entire sections from one chapter copied into another chapter, albeit with a different color scheme on it. The first three chapters really start to drag, especially Chapter 3, which honestly feels like it drags on forever. There are also some minigames and puzzles that repeat and interrupt the gameplay. New concepts are not really introduced until you hit Chapter 4, at which point things start to feel different. But up until that, you might be like me and find that you're trying to continue on because you want to know how the story plays out. It is well worth it in the end, but just be aware that until you hit Chapter 4, things might feel repetitive to the point you have yourself questioning why it never ends. Just push through it: trust me, Chapter 3 had a story, but dragged it out for far too long.			"

Wont let you use anything other then the gun type weapon, the umbrella block wouldnt even initiate after loading back up from the previous play. Tried changing configs, didnt effect it at all. Got to the point where I was tired of restarting from the last check point due to having to restart the game. Game looks awesome, good game mechanics, kinda on the easy side as far as difficulty.

												I've read a few reviews from people who didn't like the game, but I am here to tell you that this game is definitely worth playing. Story: The story line here is filled with creepy and often disturbing moments. I won't spoil anything. I think that it perfectly fits the idea that Alice in Wonderland is the result of Alice going insane and her journey to become sane once again. This game, however, goes beyond that story and is a sequel. I will say that there are some fantastic twists that I did not expect. Some of the dialogue between the characters is forgetable, but there are still some noteworthy scenes,Gameplay: Alice is an action/platformer game for those of you who can't tell. The battles can be intense at times when there are multiple enemies attacking you at once, but when the enemies are fewer, they can be too easy to defeat. The platforming can get challenging, but other times it becomes a drag when there is no end in sight for the level. The levels themselves can get long and tedious between the cutscenes, but the scenery makes up for it. Alice is a beautiful game when it's not showing you dirty decapitated dolls and piles of scrap.One important thing to note: do NOT play this with a keyboard and mouse. To me, it was impossible to play. You need an Xbox 360 wired controller if you want to enjoy this game. Overall: The game has its challenges and wonderful moments. There are a few drawbacks in dialogue and length of the levels, but the puzzles and battles well make up for it. I highly recommend this game!			"

												Although this differentiates from the classic tale, the story line remains truely captivating as the original. Between the scenery, the imaginative creatures, the monologues; Alice has won my affection yet again.  The combat is swift, the puzzles are amusing, and with the interesting mini games; I highly reccommend this to any Wonderland fan. Granted the idealism in this happens to be a tad bit on the 'dark' side, but honestly (in my own opinion of course) it adds a whole new retrospective outlook of the famous tale's meaning behind being 'Mad.'

However, the controls can get reallly buggy (especially the infamous umbrella glitch that won't let you even use the blasted thing) and the game is actually really, really challenging if your rubbish with platform games. All in all, if you can tolerate crummy controls in exchange for a brilliant story and beautiful art throughout, I have to suggest the game for you.			"

												A game with very pretty graphics and beautiful, imaginative levels, interesting weapons, decent combat and an unfortunate and almost complete lack of boss battles. Its story is also very, very dark. If you've played the first American Mcgee's Alice, this new one is darker than that. Definitely worth playing and owning, especially when it's on sale.			"

												I'm gonna make this short, sweet, and to the point.The Good:-Beautiful game-Creepy AF enemies-Psychological mind-f*ck (So I'm told)The Bad:-Rushed by EA-EA-Either poorly optimized or there's a low frame cap-Repetitive combat-Reminds me of The Hobbit for Gamecube in terms of gameplay-EAThe Ugly:-EA-At no point in my gameplay did I feel any immersion-First-Person and aiming controls are similar to Superman 64-AI are lifeless, they're deadset on getting to you as fast as possible with the least resistance. They're copy pastas of eachother with predictable movesets. I think the AI from the CoD series are more living than these abominations.The Verdict:   I bought this game because it was on sale for $4.99 and I had $4.25 Steam credit. So, for 74 cents, I can say I was amused for the first 30 minutes. However, because it's pretty much a slap chop with constant frame drops and less than enjoyable FPS, I can't sell this game with a smiling face and excitement in my voice. If you like simple, closed-world, vibrant visual environments that have a hint of whatever style of ---punk this is, go for it. However, if you like immersive environments, challenging gameplay/puzzles, and balanced combat, don't do it.			"

												Gorgeous visual and fluid, engrossing third-person platforming gameplay with puzzles that never get annoying, marred only by pointless inclusion of a few 2D platforming sections. Why do developers add stuff that detract from the whole experience? Very odd. Still, this is a memorable game for me.			"

												I gotta say it  was a fun little romp. The combat was pretty fun, the story was intresting, the characters were... ok. Enemies... eh... the ""levels"" ranged from awesome to- WTF... trust me you will hate the dollhouse section... I just couldnt pick it up again. I mean the game doesnt reward you for 100% and it feels that after ive played I have no reason or desire to play it again. So... yeah no replay value. But still its a fun little gem if it goes on sale.			"

												This game is dark, intriguing, and just hard enough to keep me engaged without stumping me (I'm pretty far from hardcore, but have been gaming for nearly a decade). My only complaint is that the Steam version doesn't award achievements. Otherwise it offers the same base game experience as the console version. Remember to shrink for clues often, and break everything!			"

												Due to the usual EA/Origin hassles, the easiest way to get this game working is to download a crack. This one works fine for me as of 06/14: http://www.ulozto.net/xMdxGPd/alice-madness-returns-crackfix-by-theta-crack-only-rar#download "

												The game is definitely a darker version of the Wonderland we all know. This game is a sequel to American McGee's Alice, and I really do appreciate this sequel. The gameplay needs work, but I like how twisted this game is, it is just creepy... I'd recommend this to players looking for something creative and dark			"

												Eerie and attractive. Some time race parts makes it frustrating sometimes, it is not always clear which way is side quest which way is main quest so that you cannot get back for the other stuff, and checkpoint saving can leave you playing that last hard part from the top just because you had to have a break and quit the game. But can't stop playing anyway and I'm glad that the game is not short.			"

												A very nice ARPG with a very good story, especially for the dresses and weapons, also, the the background is really have the mood and many interesting mini games. However, the camera didnt work nice in my computer (it not because my computer, it is bug), also, I think chp.3 is a little bit too long for me when I on the way to the peak and some of the bugs of chp.5 is pretty bad.Overall, beside the bugs, it is a nice bloody game to try play, especially when you cut off the head of Madcups, it's fun, also with a very good story.

												This is a weird game. It can be described as a 3D RPG/platformer that is somewhat story driven. The creative/ art direction really does a great job at keeping your interest  so you'll end up playing the game through just to find out what weird levels and cutscenes are coming next.			"

												Alice madness retunrrs is a whole step up from alice. Both by american mcgee. This game always keeps me coming back, not only is the world its slef ""eye candy"" but the plot is too (you have to play the games in ORDER! TO GET THE STORY!!) Is simply amazing. The game takes you thorugh your mind(alices) but the way they do is simple amzing with wonderful lushes worlds of blood and bringing back chracters from the book was just awsome. I highly recomend you get this game, Thou i had some proublems with EA not much this game rocks. the graphics next to the voice acting to the controls to secrets and many more make this game an A-B rated game			"

												Being a fan of the first game, American McGee's Alice, I was amazingly excited for the second one. However, part of the way through it, I became bored and decided to leave the title for another time. Months later, I returned to complete it on Nightmare Mode from the start. What I'm left with is a sense of satisfaction with an at-times frustrating, but rewarding combat system paired with goreous art direction, music, and and a nice story to boot. (To note on the combat, it was my skills in Nightmare Mode that made the combat frustrating.) Alas, the game had one stand-out element that made me go ""meh."" Each level has this familiar formula for pacing and layout, but with a new gorgeous skin on top of it. Because of this, it was only when I got to boss fights did things feel truly exciting aside from a couple of levels (Queensland, Dollhouse). This choice coupled with the length of the levels made them seem slighty stagnant; a complete contrast to the art of each one. Strong bias against the formulaeic level design aside, the story was well done in the end, and made me wish the first game had a story as fleshed out as this one has mustered.  7.75/10 - Definitely worthy of your time, but not going to win a ""Best Game of All Time"" award.

												Played the original Alice years ago when it came out. When i saw the preorder poster for a sequel i about♥♥♥♥♥♥myself. I was never able to pick up the game when it was originaly released but years later when it went up on a Steam sale i just had to pick it up. The game picked up where the original left off. This isnt your typical highschool reading assignment Alice. This is a sick, twisted, violent, and disturbed Alice. Your Wonderland has been corrupted by your own mind and psyche. The more you play the more disturbed you get but you simply cant stop till you unravel all the twisted corners of your mind. Pick it up, jump in, and   unravel your head till Wonderland is safe and your sanity is restored.			"
