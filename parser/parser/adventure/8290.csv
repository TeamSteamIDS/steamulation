Short version:Did you like Day of the Tentacle and its time travel puzzles? Then you are in luck, because the fourth episode in Season 2 uses the exact same concept.Long version:The penultimate episode of Season 2 marks a turning point, since this is where all the seemingly small semi-related events in previous episodes come together to form this season’s arcing plot. Our heroes finally start to investigate the disappearance of Bosco—one of the main side characters in Season 1—which leads them straight to a space-faring vessel with a time-travelling elevator on board.From here, the episode goes into the usual “finish these sub-tasks to unlock the final puzzle” formula, but this time around there are so many locations scattered in so many time periods that TellTale’s favourite adventure game design element fits the story perfectly. From turning kid Max into a womanizer to removing the past version of Agent Superball from guard duty (again), there are many throwback puzzles and gags, but also plenty of new ones.These puzzles can be quite tricky, thanks to the time-travelling aspect. It is not as extreme as it was in Day of the Tentacle (you don’t change the timeline to that extent), but noticeable enough to be challenging. I have to admit; gameplay-wise this was the one I enjoyed the most.			"

												Sam and Max, Freelance Police! ... are back in season two.(You can never have enough Sam and Max!!) - and yes, they are just as good in Season2. And if you thought they couldn't go further than season 1... you will be surprised.Note: You really need to play these games in order. The story builds, characters are introduced, and if you haven't played previous games, you won't understand the backstory.Hilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10			"
