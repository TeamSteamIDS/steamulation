												It's hard to give this game a solid recommendation. It's an alright dialogue-driven adventure game where some of the dialogue is sung, like a musical. However, most of the singing is pretty bad and off-key. This might be a reference to how autotuned mainstream music is nowadays, a topic that the game touches upon. Intentional or not, it did make my ears bleed a bit. The clay models used to depict the characters are hideous and the stop-motion only has a few frames so it never really feels authentic. The story is nothing to write home about, a short slice-of-life about gender equality and a bad economy (and autotuned pop music). Game is quite short too. Took me less than an hour and a half (that's less time than what is required to get the steam trading cards for the game).			"

												It's a game that requires no skill, or thought which can be relaxing, or boring depending on the person.  Me, I found it boring.  There's no challenge when you can only click what they let you click when they let you click it, and your clicks can't affect the outcome of the game.  You're a spectator here, not a player.  I would describe this as an interactive music video rather than a game.  You will spend 80% of your time watching shoddy claymation figures (an aesthetic choice, I assume, rather than a lack of skill... I hope) talk-sing tuneless songs with straightforward, uncreative lyrics.  The aesthetic was half my motivation for purchasing the game, but I have far less appreciation for it now that the whole experience feels lackluster, and lazy.  I'm sure a lot of hard work went into the game, and I don't really mean to disparage the makers, it's just that because the game is so underwhelming it soured me on everything.  Point-and-click games can have depth, and challenge, but here the challenge is enjoying the show.  I couldn't.			"

												I absolutely adore showtunes.  My CD collection is almost entirely made up of Broadway cast recordings.  I also like to play video games.  A musical video game sounded like a great concept, and it still does.  This is hardly a musical, though, because there aren't any real songs.  There's dialogue that's written in rhyme and just happens to be sung.  There are no melodies, and that's the joke.  And this joke becomes very grating very quickly.  There's only so much off-key singing you can take!The story isn't very interesting.  Trying to solve the mystery will pose a slight challenge, but you'll still get through it in about an hour and it wont have any lasting impact on you.  There's no replay value unless you really think the game's funny, and personally, I do not.  There are a few funny jokes, but it's not nearly on the level of The Stanley Parable or even Octodad.			"

												Took roughly 1.5 hours and... well, I can safely say it has been the most 'indie' game related experience I've had this year.Seriously, black and white claymation musical dialogue-tree adventure game about a transgender inventor turned private detective investigating Auto-Tune usage in music industry? That's as far from dudebro shooter as you can go in gaming I think.Not sure if it's actually worth of your or anyone's time. If you like experimental 'games', maybe. Don't expect too much though.Also, as weird as that sounds when talking about a musical game, the singing was uniformly terrible.			"

												Wish I could recommend this game as the art style is very unique, and the game is a decent adventure to play through once -- but the big gimmick in this game is that just about every second line of dialogue is sung... and it is absolutely horrible to listen to.Sad that they couldn't get people who actually can SING to do the voices. The performances range from awkward to painful.			"

												So that trailer looks pretty cool right? Well you're probably alright stopping there. Not to jump on the negative review train; the game is a pretty harmless and innocent hour and a half with nothing egregious, but what's in the trailer is pretty much all there is to the game, albeit with a predictable detective story tacked on.First off let me just list off why the game intrigued me enough for an impulse buy, so we can compare expectations and see if the game actually lives up to them. I bought this game because:-it's a musical-it's claymation-its themes include gender, which is particularly tender and interesting to me-it apparently did well in IGF nominations-it's only an hour and a half long, which for someone with a massive backlog is actually an incentiveNow that I've played it, my positives are:-it's one continuous musical adventure, with each screen change being accompanied by new music. The vamp technologyleading into each character's singing parts isn't perfect but is cool nonetheless.-it has a lot of trombone...And that's about it. Let's break this down further.The musical element is the game's most unique and as mentioned above, works well enough. I don't actually have a huge problem with the ""grating"" voices: to me it along with the point and click mechanics create somewhat of a nostalgic experience. It really feels like a stage show, which is neat. At the same time, there's nothing particularly complex about the compositions, and the game doesn't really embrace the ""musical"" idea fully, it's just kinda there.The claymation is very crude and pretty much a gimmick. It's very low resolution assests with no graphic options to speak of.The gender theme isn't near as prominent as I expected and rather forced, thankfully it's not offensive but it's also not trailblazing.As far as gameplay goes there's very little to speak of, just exhausting dialogue options. This isn't inherently bad, there are great games like Attack of the Friday Monsters that use this so as to not feel gamey or proprietary in any way. But that's the thing, you'll still be navigating basic menus for most of it so the fact that this is a very shallow, simple game will always be in the forefront of your mind. That said, it is simple enough for anyone to play and you won't get frustrated or stuck.The story is the primary focus of the game, and it's pretty disposable. For one it's indulgent; you're thrown in with little context and immediately expected to care about the characters with no concept to guide the experience. The game constantly repeats information you've just heard back to you. It's pretty humorless; there are bits of overdone social commentary here and there that are really random and don't fit in with anything else: this is unfortunately the extent of the game's themes. And in general it's all pretty incidental, with a lack of finese to the storytelling, and it's just not at all cohesive! For all its twists and turns it never does anything unseen in other point and clicks or noir. The ending at least had potential to satisfy and bowtie all the elements but it feels unfinished, like the last 15 minutes are part of a different game.So yeah in the end it's just kinda boring, you know? It's one of those cases where you have to take a step back and realize that just because it's cool as a trailer doesn't mean it'll be cool as a game, especially since it never explores any of its enticing elements. Still, on sale for a quick runthrough you can do a lot worse.			"

AUDIOCringeyVISUALExperimentalDIFFICULTYEasyVIBECash-grabCRAVINGExperimentalON SALEFrequentlyPROS: Stop-Motion is an interesting medium, I would like to see this explored further in the future. The music itself is not bad, and I'm glad that they took a legitimate swing at composing their own pieces.CONS:  This game was crowdfunded, and it's certainly not 10,000USD worth of work. Even the basic act of being able to get commentary of all surroundings in a room is not available. The voices and dialogue are extremely bad, even when it's not intending to be. Ending is absolutely terrible. Very little work within the same scene is done. It's a lot of back and forth between locations.WORTH: The story can easily be beaten within less than two hours because of the limited nature of the maps and the lack of interactivity. (My play-time was padded by working to make a guide.) If you aren't getting this in a bundle or at a serious discount, you will be disappointed.OVERALL: Betrayals of trust like this will be the death of sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo.SCORE:3/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Stop to imagine a world where it's possible to see something so visually offensive, that it actually hurts you physically. This game attacked my every sense, throwing my brain into a DBZ-like battle. Except my brain was Krillin and the game itself was all of the major villains fused together. I became ill while playing this game, so much that I had to go watch The Lion King and wonder what I was doing with my life.This game is not good. I don't think I've ever wanted to remove my hard drive and wash it with soap after playing a videogame before.			"

http://www.cublikefoot.com/dominique-pamplemousse-first-impressions/Dominique Pamplemousse, what a strange game (and title!).The game felt more like a musical than an actual game. There was very little input on my part while playing, most of my time was spent listening to some off-key singing. The visuals are probably the game's strongest point. All of the characters are made of clay and the animation is in a stop motion format, which is kinda cool, but not enough to make up for the gameplay. The game's story is not that interesting either. It's not a bad story, but it's far from a good one.			"

												Initially, I wasn't attracted by Dominique Pamplemousse's style. But I was still intrigued by that game sounding so French (I mean, Dominique is also used in French and Pamplemousse is a fruit). After getting it, I decided to try it. Besides, it's not a heavy file and I'm still trying to run after all my backlog trading cards.It's a point and click game in black and white, with characters in... well, you know the stuff that you can use to model? Well, the animation is really well done even if they chose to add a grainy film. But while Dominique Pamplemousse is a short game with two endings, the real originality is that 90% of the dialogue are sung. And in tune with the music.Besides, even if the voice actors aren't The Voice, it's not breaking your ears because of false notes. Besides, the lines are funny so... And the credits are also original as everyone who backed the project has their names being spoken, rather quickly.Anyway, for $4 dollars, you're not ripped. Don't expect to be the game of the year but still, a little indie crowdfunded game that is enjoyable.			"

												Why does this exist? Why does it only last an hour and a half? Why is most of that time spent listening to characters sing badly? Why are there only two puzzles in it that aren't just pressing every dialog option until it works? Why are the two puzzles so simple a new born could do it in under a minute each?

												I cautiously recommend this, cautiously only because it's not a game for everyone; if you're in the right audience though, it's a hilarious and fun, although short ride of an adventure game. It's a game about wierdos, for wierdos, presumably made by wierdos.Although there are multiple endings (which seem to be determined only by the final choice), the game itself is pretty short. A single play-through takes about an hour. The game mechanics are simple but completely workable: you click on items on the screen to get dialogue or action options, or add things to your inventory. Most of the interactions are in the form of (frequently sung) dialogue, although there is some light puzzling, but it's mostly in the form of bouncing between locations as you open further dialogue options.The story is cute and cleverly written. It's also pretty socially consious, but not annoyingly so. For the right audience, there are many clever bon mots and allusions peppered throughout the dialogue. The singing is horrible and off-key... but that's part of the charm. The story revolves around economic depression and autotuning in the music industry. It also playfully touches on gender identity in a way that makes me wish the game had been a bit longer and that had somehow been more of a story point.The graphics... well, I think it's self-evident from the screenshots above. The models and animation are exceedingly simplistic, but they're charming in a Gumby kind-of way. I think the graphics work well in light of the humorous tone of the game, but your mileage may vary.All in all I enjoyed the game, and hope this is not the last we see of Dominique Pamplemousse. If you like quirky, cleverly written off-beat games, give this one a shot, especially if it's on sale. But if you find out-of-key singing and simplisticly built and animated clay models to be grating, spend your money and time elsewhere.			"

												I can't in good conscience consider this a good game I can recommend, but it was interesting watching it fail at what it's trying to do, and at least it's an original concept.The only way I can describe it is as a stop motion musical in a point & click framework. It mostly fails at all these three things, mainly by looking, sounding and playing as the work of an amateur. The art style is distinct, but the stop motion isn't all that good. Still, it's charming. The music and highschool-musical-theater singing are also kinda charming, at least once you realize that the singing is off key and rather bad ""on purpose"", but you still can't call them good. The point & click elements are barely there, with no real choices and no real puzzles, just serving to move you forward in the story.I think what really tipped this over to no for me was the story. It's very much on the nose. It's got some points to make, and instead of building them organically into its storytelling, it just repeats them over and over. We are never really allowed to empathize with the characters: Instead of watching them deal with the world and its problems we are being told what their problems are and are expected to feel something from that. Good storytelling doesn't really work that way. So if one of the goals of the game was to make us think about gender and the economy, it very much falls flat. Instead of sounding humorous and lighthearted as it seems to attempt to, it feels awkward and preachy.So an interesting little amateur experiment, the first commercial game of a single developer working on their own, trying out a relatively novel idea. I didn't regret the cup of coffee I paid for it with the discount, because the aesthetic is charming and  because it didn't overstay its welcome, but that doesn't mean it's a good game.			"

												TL;DR It's an acquired taste.Are you one of those people who think quaint is adorable and nurse a private curiosity for all the quirks in this world like it’s a badge of honour? Well, then! This may be the game for you. But then again it may not be, as I'm one of those people and yet I still failed to enjoy this game. If you received Dominique Pamplemousse: It's All Over When the Fat Lady Sings for free or in a random bundle, there isn't too much harm in trying it out. If that's not the case and for some crazy reason you're thinking of buying it, I desperately urge you to reconsider because I don't know what I've been doing for two hours listening to the horrendous singing in this point and click detective story.I got my copy like a lot of others, through my Humble Bundle purchase. The content is exactly what you see in the game trailer above where you get to click on things and listen to the characters talk/give clues into the case you're on while you, as the player are immobilised while characters sing their hearts out with a monotonous atmosphere. I played this for an hour on my own but then I closed it but when I tried to play it again the next day. It had failed to keep my progress so I spent the remainder of my time using a walkthrough to push through. I like to try and finish games but this one was more like, 'Come too far to turn back at this point...' I'd got stuck anyway as I hadn't thought to look under Devon's bed and was running around in circles. If you stick to reading/exhausting everything then you won't get stumped as easily as there is literally nothing that you can do wrong in this game to change an outcome. There is a choice at the very end but even that has little merit to game play so meh. This is still a preference of mine for point and click mystery titles as it keeps the experience pleasant (if a little boring) and away from unwarranted stress. I don't actually play this genre after becoming overly frustrated whilst playing Sam & Max Hit the Road as a little girl (even though it's now a classic).My admiration for stop motion animated work like the world famous, Wallace and Gromit series as well as full length features such as The Boxtrolls is on constant overflow. But with Pamplemousse it is akin to watching a tragic and horrific instalment of musical theatre and not being able to up and leave because you're lodged smack in the centre of a hot, stuffy hall along with all the other people who also are not enjoying themselves but ended up stuck there. I can only imagine how hard the creator worked to make this so I'm appalled at myself for having to leave such a negative review but as a game this feels more like those demo CDs you used to get for free in the 90s after buying some other popular game.What's great is that you can multitask while in game, though. It opened in my Adobe Flash Player and so I could keep it running and minimise it while checking my email or I could keep focused on the story while eating dinner. You can also click to fast-forward/skip the talking in between though you have to put up with all the singing. The story is all right and the characters are likeable. It was fantastic to see a genderqueer protagonist and also watch how the other characters started flailing at whether Dominique was ""a girl or boy"". It has light humour but you'll have to lower your expectations more and also find a way to get past the horrendous singing. I actually could take it no longer (though the voice acting was solid) and watched/played it like a black and white silent film by taking out my earphones and reading the subtitles for half of the game. Though it is all right to play yourself if you're set on doing so and have the time as well as patience (the singing... it burns!!), the Dominique Pamplemousse guide by Burger is a good way to breeze through it in half an hour if you'd prefer.  Unfortunately, I dislike this game the most out of all the Steam games I've played so far. :( It's cute but I will not touch this game(?) ever again.			"

												Dominique Pamplemousse has some negative reveiws. When I first saw this game in the Steam Store it had mixed reveiws. But this game is not all that bad. Yes, there are bad things about it, that's why there are negative reveiws, but I must say the game was worth the money I spent on it.The bad traits of this game are clearly and without doubt, bad things. There's no arguement that makes the bad traits go away, but the good traits do outweigh it. Firstly, the game is quite short, surprisingly short. This SHOULDN'T be a surprise though, when you think about how hard claymation is to do, how long it takes, and it's clear that the game makers put a lot of effort into this game, just not enough to make it a full length game, and obviously the time  also depends on how good you are at completeing the game.Secondly, the voices, Dominique Pamplemousse is about singing, about the music industry and opera. The bad singing voices at the start of the game are really cringeworthy, they make you feel uncomfortable, because we are not used to listening to people sing normally, and this game perfectly demonstrates that, (which is one of the reasons I love it!) it shows that some people sing normally. The singing is not so much bad, as normal. After a few minutes of the characters all singing you get used to it, and playing a game with an opera sort of stlye can get quite enjoyable, when you realise the voices aren't really THAT bad. And it's such a special experience seeing someone in a musical type setting who doesn't have a strangely perfect voice.The game makes a lot of claims. It claims that it is a game about gender, and economy, which it really isn't about that much. Yes, the protagonist is non-binary, and appears to express their thoughts about this, and having all the rest of the characters confused about the protagonist's gender. It is clear that this game planned for this to be a big theme, but it didn't really turn out that way, because the game is clearly too short for them to have any discussions about gender or even the economy.Dominique Pamplemousse does seem to have some bad things about it, but it is really worth buying, as it is a beautiful claymation game, and I really am in love with any type of claymation, or any game made with real life materials. This game really has some nice subtle discussions on auto-tune and the music industry, which is not a common plot for video games to have. This game is also in black and white, which is another rare thing for video games, as video games are too advanced to have really gone through a black and white period (if you don't count the time when games could only be in two colours) as televisions did.One last little touch on this nice game, which barely has anything to do with the game, is that it has DLC that you can buy that will give you the sheet music, and sheet music is such a lovely thing to buy as DLC, which is really the whole reason I bought it, but I enjoyed it past the sheet music. This game isn't really that expensive and not really that long, but if you have around $5 you should think about buying it.			"

												It's a touch on the short side, although reflected in the price, which is in no way indicative of quality of game.  The pacing for me personally was off, making for a game which feels like it ends abruptly, almost as soon as it starts to pickup.This said, it's a game which made me smile.If you enjoy the idea of very basic point and click with noir / jazz / musical undertones and stylised black and white claymation stop motion techniques harking back to childhood memories of Trapdoor, Morph and the early beginnings of Aardman Animations then you'd most likely appreciate the short interactive experience which the game has to offer.

												Personally, this game is not quite right for me. That said, it is at the very least an interesting concept. Most lines are done in the form of a song in time with the background music. While an interesting idea, I couldn't quite get into that. The visuals are definitely very interesting, too, very unusual. There are plenty of ideas put into this game that I could enjoy, but were just not quite done in a way that I could personally enjoy. But with a clear non-binary protagonist, which is a very nice plus, as an agender person myself.I only recommend this game, because there's no middle option, and I would say that you should at the very least give it a try,			"

												I'm trying not to be nasty about this game because it was made mostly from donations on indiegogo (they even mention every person that donated in the credits which I thought was a nice touch). And from what I've researched the game developer is not super experienced so I want to put this into the 'it's the first game I made' pile... I mean heck the website said it was mostly filmed with a freakin iPad. So lets not be too judgemental.! That being said ! The singing is truly awful, but it's funny. When they started singing, and they were out of key and the stop motion animation looked like it came from high school students my initial reaction was - urg. However, as I proceeded the terrible singing and non sensical lyrics became funny and charming. What I did enjoy was the music. Check out this youtube clip

 of the band responsible for the soundtrack. This game takes at the most two hours to complete so don't expect complex gameplay.. in fact don't expect any gameplay. However this is a good case for Dominique Pamplemousse because I swear if this game was even ten minutes longer I would have punched my computer. It is meant to be a short game... It's kinda like that one friend you have that's fun to be around in small doses because they're silly and quirky but if you spend more than an hour or two with them you're ready to pull their tongue out and feed it to the wolves.Worth the experience if the game is free or if it comes with a nice little bundle.

												The reviews seem to be love or hate, but I'm set on ""generally charmed"". Dominique Pamplemousse is a game that oozes hipster indie style, and that's not my interest. But the game is short and sweet enough that I'm happy with it as a bonus to a Humble Bundle. Check out some clips to see if you have any interest.The game is flawed but charming, short but a complete tale. I normally hate on Flash designs, but the game is short enough to complete in one sitting (30-60 minutes) so save-loss doesn't hurt so much. The game reminds me of the 90's; the modern environment would never fund the quirky games developed then. Gameplay is simple point-click adventure, but nothing is really clunky or poor. The singing can be annoying but never bothered me enough to stop it. The story was odd but generally worked. My main irritation: Why frame Dominique to be removed from the scene? The easier alternative was to not hire that detective in the first place. Dominique already resigned to losing the research years ago.I enjoyed the game, more than others which I've gotten for free or in a bundle. I'll admit, the game should probably be fully free but there are free methods to enjoy the game if you really need. The game could be polished and improved, but I would be interested in a sequel. It's odd and campy, but I found it entertaining for an evening. I'd recommend a sale, but the game is unique enough that you should determine how much you're willing to pay yourself, no discount target from me this time.			"

Short version: 74%Dominique Pamplemousse is a fun but short detective story claymation musical. The game has a really interesting premise, but it tends to get buried under the creator’s “messages”.Long version:Dominique Pamplemousse is a crowd-funded adventure game made by an independent developer, Deirdra Kiai. On paper. In reality it is a claymation musical with little gaming involved.The presentation looks amateurish and cheap, but it seems like an artistic choice; I have to admit, it adds a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The same cannot be wholeheartedly said about the singing (all done by the creator itself), as it is often off-key. Which, oddly enough, fits the plot: the player takes the role of the titular character, a private detective, who is hired to find a pop star, but eventually gets entangled in the shady voice-manipulation plots of a record company.For the most part, the story works. Except when it is stopped to repeatedly convey Deirdra’s message about gender identity and financial issues. These out-of-place topics don’t ruin the game, but they certainly made this cheap, short, but sweet title a little less excellent.			"

												I'll put this in simplest way possible: You're either gonna hate this game or absolutely love it. There is no in between.I happened to love it. It's a quirky point-and-click game where you place as a detective who can't pay his rent. I can't really say much else without spoiling the game. Almost every line is the game is sung. The singing is off pitch but can be pretty funny. The game itself is actually pretty funny. You will either enjoy almost every second of the dialogue and music or hate is so much that you can't play it for more than 5 minutes. To sum it up, if you like quirky games that will make you laugh a bit, you will probably like this. If you like serious games, this is not for you. Also, if you don't think you'll be into it, you probably won't be.			"

												I NOMINATED THIS GAME FOR:THE “SO BAD, IT'S GOOD” AWARDDominique Pamplemousse in “It’s All Over Once The Fat Lady Sings!” is less the Undertale or Earthbound type of quirky; games that are drowning in funny dialogue put against the backdrop of a somewhat sub standard looking RPG, and more the ""I can't believe somebody actually made this"" quirky.With claymation graphics and characters wearing tissue outfits that have some rather visible strings and rubber bands, along with the game frequently bursting into some very hit and miss songs, Dominique Pamplemousse could be called 'misguided' by tosspots like me and 'crap' by most.But that's why I like it, and why I think it deserves this award. Not because it's a 'good' game, but because it provides a fun, if unintentional experience. Grab some beers and friends, and sit down for a one of a kind experience.			"

												If rhymes shoehorned into a taleis an idea you don't find too lame,I bought this on a Steam Sale,I'll suggest you do the same.--Sorry, had to get that out, just played through it in one sitting and the rhythm, and sometimes lack thereof, is catchy in ways.  Hideously catchy.I love claymation, and even though this is super low-end budget style, I liked the characters and backgrounds.  Animation is not very varied but it gets a... thing of sort... across.After the first scene or so, the overt cheesiness of the constant amateur singing of the majority of the dialogue wore away.  It really is nice how the music score rolls right along and the dialogues always queue up to hit the beat right when they ought to.  It's a neat effect requiring only momentary pause, and feels really natural in a sort of... absurd impromptu musical.  I liked the score quite a bit and, partnered with the timing of the singing, it honestly felt like the most polished part of the game.The plot is admittedly pretty silly and nothing worth writing home about, but it might give you a weird kind of chuckle.The gameplay was very simple, a brief point and click adventure.  I've played a handful of point and clicks, and this one, while it required no massive leaps in logic (which is good), it was far too easy (which is bad).  Regarding variation, there's far more interrogation of the characters (which makes sense given the musical platform) than there are backgrounds to be searched and interacted with.  Finally, there isn't a lick of puzzle element in this game, which I find to be kind of irregular for the genre, but to each its own, I guess.The kicker, it was super short, a shade more than an hour.  (Additional ""playtime"" was spent waiting for card drops.)To sum it up, weirdly catchy tunes, too easy, odd visuals, and too short.Get it on sale if you're feeling frisky, I guess.			"

												It pains me a bit to give a thumbs down to this game. I'm very grateful to spend some time with a genderqueer protagonist, and the concept is great. There's an alternative universe somewhere where this is my favorite game of all time. But the puzzles, music, dialogue, interface, and animation are not well executed, the game is unnecessarily difficult & painful to actually play, and the game turns out to not have very much of interest to say.You can check out some of the author's other work at their website, http://squinky.me/. There are some interesting ideas in the short games there, and I'm looking forward to following the author as they develop & create.			"

L.A. Noire Dominique Pamplemousse is a next generation crime thriller developed by Deidra Kiai Productions. L.A Noire Dominique Pamplemousse is an interactive detective story set in the classic noir period of the late 1940's. It blends action, detection and complex storytelling and draws players into an open-ended challenge to solve a series of gruesome murders. Set in a perfectly recreated Los Angeles before freeways, with a post-war backdrop of corruption, drugs and jazz, L.A. Noire Domique Pamplemousse truly blends cinema and gaming.			"

												This game isn't that good, but it is amazing. Cons: Not very much game play; just wandering around asking people about things, as detectives do, and waiting very patiently as they answer you in *very* long-winded off-key operatic fashion.Pros: The protaganist is likeable, the plot is quirky and has some surprises, and some of the lyrics are funny. The fact that all the voices and literally everything in the game was done by one person, apparently with materials they had lying around gives Dominique Pamplemouses aheartwarming, endearing quality. I played it and thought ""wow, I could make a game.""In short, this is the best black & white zero-budget claymation rock opera detective game out there these days. Buy it in a sale if you want to kill a few hours.			"

Do not expect extreme adventure and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this is not assassins creed, this is a completely new parody/musical/interactive genre. you would only get disappointed with it if you expected some unoriginal copycat mainstream crap. 9/10 for me but only because it is short, i would like to see more parts of this and i would most definitely buy them since they dont require brainstorming. great game to light up a joint and fall back into your chair. thank you guys for making this!

The story is compelling and funny, and the game is well made, so really the only thing you could object to is the singing. Unless you really like naive, untrained singing, you might struggle playing this for more than 15-20 minutes at a time. But I think it would work well in little bursts anyway, so if the game looks interesting to you, get it. I had a great time with this.			"

												Disclaimer: I did not play much of this game, despite what Steam says. After the first few minutes, I simply left it running for trading cards.Dominique Pamplemousse is a form of black-and-white, interactive, stop-motion musical. There is, as far as I could tell from my short playthrough and from looking at videos online, very little gameplay, which means its success hinges upon the quality of its visual and musical aspects. Visually, it presents a striking aesthetic, which might please some; musically, however, I find it to be a failure, as the lyrics are uninspired and the melody monotonous. Perhaps it improves over time, but it failed to grab and hold my attention, and from looking at others' experiences, it doesn't seem like playing it any longer would have made it better.I cannot recommend it.

												A short, cute story.Dominique Pamplemousse is a very easy game with a short play time and few puzzles. That statement doesn't sound too appealing, so why would I recommend it?It is unique. Visually the game is pleasing and pictured from simple cardboard and plasticine type models. The main interest in the game is the singing of the characters. They sing in a kind of poetic way and with voices that are clearly meant to confuse certain issues. The main character him/herself is rather an enigma. One voice sounds just like the character 'Rudi' from Steve Wright's Radio 1 afternoon show of the late eighties / early nineties ('Let me innn, Let me innn')The story itself is straightforward, though with a couple of neat twists and turns. It's probably almost impossible to fail in this game as it mostly told through exhausting all the dialogue options. There are a couple of easy puzzles in there too though.I honestly don't think I could have stood the game had it been much longer, as the voices are of limited appeal after a while, but for the hour and a half to two hours it takes to play it, this was thankfully not an issue.There is an interesting choice to be made at the end, which I guess gives it some replay value.For the low price, it's a good couple of hours worth of entertainment.

												My favorite part of Dominique Pamplemousse is probably what polarizes it most: that ""trying hard to look like you're not trying hard"" sort of style. The crude choppy claymation, the characters singing with the quality of a middle school musical, severely shoehorned rhymes, it's something that you'll find charming or downright annoying. Next is the setting, the style is clearly made too look like 1940's black and white crime dramas, and includes most of the tropes. BUT you get these references that clearly place this in present day (twitter, auto-tune, etc.), and the dissonance that this creates is as unique as it is hilarious.All of the plot exposition is in song, which as I've said before you'll love or hate. Each character has their own melody that reflects their personality. The plot itself, however, isn't very remarkable and you'll see the twist coming a mile away.The gameplay is definitely the weakest element of the game, very simple point and click mechanics and puzzles that aren't very difficult to solve, it's just a means to an end to carry the exposition.Oh, and the main character is genderqueer, which I wasn't expecting. The game doesn't really make this a main part of the story or anything, it's just a passing fact, which I found pretty cool. And the way they deflect other characters' prodding question as to their sex/gender is both masterful and hilarious.			"

												So you're wondering whether or not to buy Dominique Pamplemousse. As you're probably aware, it's a short point-and-click adventure presented as some kind of amateur musical. The trailer didn't give you much in the way of gameplay, but you did hear some off-key singing accompanied by some off-beat horn accompaniment. ""What is the deal?"", you ask. ""Is it worth my time and/or money?""Well that's a very tough question. Dominique Pamplemousse is a game that dares you to hate it. I hope my review proves useful, but ultimately you're going to have to decide for yourself. I experienced it, and came out the other side impressed and entertained, but at all times, I was a hair's breadth away from shaking my head and walking away.At it's heart, Dominique Pamplemousse is a simplified point-and-click adventure. There are objects you need to pick up or examine and people you need to interrogate or manipulate. There's no inventory system to speak of; all items are applied automatically when you examine something relevant to them. The puzzles are usually fairly easy, and examinable items are typically made reasonably clear.Outside of this adventure game core, there's a whole bunch of weirdness. As I've already mentioned, this game is also sort of a musical. In most locations, there's some kind of weird horn-based accompaniment on loop. Sometimes, for basically no reason, these characters will sing along to this accompaniment, which leads to a bunch of awkward pauses while they wait for their cue. While (thankfully) not all responses are in song form, it's a weird gimmick that comes off as more charming than annoying... most of the time.DP is largely the work of a single person: Diedra Kiai. As if making the game musical wasn't enough, Kiai voices all of the characters, including when they sing. Kiai doesn't seem to have any formal vocal training (or acting training), and the characters are frequently off-key. Every character is Kiai putting on a different voice, and some of the voices are somewhat cringeworthy.The visual design is another contentious point. The characters and many of the background objects are clay figures that are stop motion animated, and the whole game is rendered in greyscale. Everything that isn't clay is cardboard or paper, often with visible tearing or some other tell-tale mark that makes immersion impossible. The clay figures themselves tend to be rough, with visible thumbprints, wavy lines that are supposed to be straight, or just a general lack of detail. The clay people range from abstractly recognisable as a person, to something bordering on reptillian!---TLDR--- There's a lot to criticise here, but depending on your disposition, it'll either come across as frustratingly half-baked, or charmingly hand-made and uniquely weird (in the good sense). I can't say it was the best story either. I would be  unsurprised if many of you walked away thinking that it was the worst game you've ever played. For me, it was an extremely unique experience, one that was initially off-putting, but I came away charmed and entertained nonetheless.For most people, it's probably not worth the asking price, but it goes on sale often enough. Best pick it up then.			"

												Honestly, this game.Picked it up off the Humble Bundle, and glad I didn't buy it.This game has the worst voice acting ever. Whether it's on purpose, I can't tell, but it sounds terrible.You click on something, and the guy says ""Oh look. A stack of bills I havn't payed"" *pause*And then you're like, oh good its over, I can get back to playing. But no. The main character 'sings' at you for another 10 seconds.The graphics are kind of ok I guess, but that doesn't justify buying it. The music might be satirical, but I honestly don't see it being anything more than a thing to suffer through to get to the next point in the story.I would not recommend this game to anyone that likes good graphics, good singing, and has a limited sense of (very) hidden satire. But you know. Each to their own			"

												The game promises stopmotion animation, but each character has maybe three frames of a walk cycle, three arm positions and two mouth positions.  That's it.  Characters just stand in place and talk.  Also, the character design is hideous.  It does not look ""artistic.""  It looks like incompetence.The game promises a musical, but there are no songs.  Each character merely sings her (his?) spoken lines.  It's not very musical at all, and the singing is often difficult to sit through because it's very drawn out and... unpleasant to the ears.  I admit the singing is probably supposed to be bad (which makes it funny), but without some context and better writing, it's just bad singing.The game promises a detective story, but it lasts maybe an hour.  Not enough time to get to know the characters, or the setting.The game promises to be about the economy and gender identity, and I get the feeling the creator has something to say about them, but it doesn't come across here.  Both are mentioned a few times, but neither is important to the tiny story.There was potential in this project if it had been better executed.  It needed better writing, character design, animation and performers.  I guess the 10 grand on Indiegogo went entirely to the musicians, because I don't see it anywhere else.			"

Ugly, beyond ugly no actual thoughtful gameplay, its just going through every button in order and moving on to the next (HORRENDOUSLY sung) room.

												A short point and click adventure. It has an interesting art style and the entire game a musicial (kinda). Now the game itself is no more than 45 minutes in length. There are a few funny moments, but the musicial gets old really quickly. I enjoyed playing through the game and I got it in a humble bundle, but I'm not sure I could recommend this game. Its just not that good even if it did make me smile. Considering how short it was it still managed to outstay its welcome. This could just be the few times I got to the point of clicking on everything in the screen and using every speech choice to get through the point and click adventure game logic for it to allow me to advance.

												So you're wondering whether or not to buy Dominique Pamplemousse. As you're probably aware, it's a short point-and-click adventure presented as some kind of amateur musical. The trailer didn't give you much in the way of gameplay, but you did hear some off-key singing accompanied by some off-beat horn accompaniment. ""What is the deal?"", you ask. ""Is it worth my time and/or money?""Well that's a very tough question. Dominique Pamplemousse is a game that dares you to hate it. I hope my review proves useful, but ultimately you're going to have to decide for yourself. I experienced it, and came out the other side impressed and entertained, but at all times, I was a hair's breadth away from shaking my head and walking away.At it's heart, Dominique Pamplemousse is a simplified point-and-click adventure. There are objects you need to pick up or examine and people you need to interrogate or manipulate. There's no inventory system to speak of; all items are applied automatically when you examine something relevant to them. The puzzles are usually fairly easy, and examinable items are typically made reasonably clear.Outside of this adventure game core, there's a whole bunch of weirdness. As I've already mentioned, this game is also sort of a musical. In most locations, there's some kind of weird horn-based accompaniment on loop.

												A okay game, has no widescreen, didn't really bother me, but can be buggy at times when saving and exiting. but also, very good music, and a great taste for younger children. Not a very long game, I beat it my self in an hour and thirty minutes, which is a bit, but not very long. Afterall, for 5 dollars compaired to The Order of 1886 (i think thats what it's called. I never paid too much attention) which only lasts for 5 hours, this game is good and I would reccommend it to anyone who has some spare money in intention of having a giggle here and there, but it plays best on non widescreen. there is no options, so there is no way to fix it unless they create a patch, and the entire game is flash based, which is okay, but not the greatest game option, it runs perfectly fine on older computers, but if you don't like games that have large and quite annoying cutscenes sometimes (outresgeously out of key singing) then I wouldn't reccommend it. Any other way though, I would. Anyone who likes HD, this game is not for you. Anyone who likes an option screen to entitle the game to your own likings, this game is not for you, but if you don't really care at all about these things, I wouldn't even bother not buying this game. It is a great ""semi"" time waster, and doesn't take that long to beat. for 5 dollars, I would reccommend this game to anyone who doesn't care about what I've referenced above.			"

												I tried really hard to like this game, because it's so different, has a (female? nobinary? transgender?) lead, and is supposedly full of witty musical numbers, but I couldn't do it. One of the first problems I noticed was that you can't skip singing during many parts of the game. I read very quickly, and so more often than not I skip ahead once I'm done reading text even if the character is still talking-- but I couldn't do that with this game. I understand that skipping would have ruined the rhythm of the songs etc., but really, there was no rhythm in the first place.I appreciate where the game was trying to go (discussing gender equality, sexism, a horrible music industry, etc.), but it was just really, really strange. A claymation musical with gameplay centred entirely around dialogue options sounds like a not-great idea-- not necessarily bad, but not great-- but when the singing is bad and the claymation looks a bit hellish, I think that you're going to have a bad time with a game. It's also rather short, so I suppose if you really wanted to see what it was about, you could buy it and then return it immediately (I doubt you'll keep it in your library).  It can be a good game with some major fixes, but right now I don't think it's worth buying unless you pick it up in a Humble Bundle with some good games.			"

												[edit@05/08/15: To be fair, I played this for more than an hour, really trying to give it another chance (for the third time).  I still stand by everything I say/said about it.  It is REALLY bad.]I love claymation, and I love adventure games, but I hate musicals.I hate them with a passion.  Especially bad ones.I get what they were going for, but I am afraid they did not hit the right mark for me.Maybe it is just because I hate musicals?  I mean, if you look at my library of games, I clearly like ""bad"" games.This was definately a bad game, but I found it remarkedbly bad, even muted (because then I couldn't hear anything--which was a blessing, but it is pointless playing something if you have to mute it to enjoy it).  And muting it did not make me enjoy it anyway.I give it a 2 out of 10.  2 is for the cute claymation and obvious love put into making this.  -8 is for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ constant, awful singing.  I ""think"" this was supposed to be the humor appeal of the game, but I found it very irritating, and not very clever besides.My apologies to the developers.. I really wanted to like this, and I wanted to give it a good review, but maybe on your next game you should get a better writer, and remove ALL of the singing.  Especially THAT type of singing.  I'm seriously not trying to be mean.. I look at all of this potential and it deeply saddens me to see it wasted in this way.			"

When Casey came out and starting ""singing"" it was absolutely hysterical. This is a satirical commentary on the sad state of electronically altered pop music and a throwback to classic musical theater. Brilliantly done.			"

												Dominique Pimplemoose is a video game.Most people who play video games regularly would probably not find Dominique Poopypants to be a good video game.Dominique Preppyplotz is driven by the most basic of point-n-click mechanics; don't let the haters convince you otherwise: Dominique Pamplemousse is a game that is worth playing.Soon's I started the game, I was assaulted by grating talk-singing and laughable animations. The premise was somewhat intriguing and the environments were actually >adequate. I kept playing to see where the game would lead; I discovered more of the same, but grew to enjoy even the worst aspect (except having to call the Officer to the cell over and over - not really a big deal either, though). This is truly one of those games that is ""so bad it's good."" This is actually a game that took skill to make and was intentionally made ("")poorly(""). I wouldn't say it's on par with the level of incredibly talented portrayal of being talentless like Spinal Tap, but I enjoyed Do'mousse very much. The ending made me feel weird though: There are two endings. The one I picked didn't really amount to much...""The economy"" is referenced several times throughout 'nique'Pample (pronounced ""kneecap-Lantern""); having the apparently far-fetched opinion that I do - that Dominique Pamplemousse is worth your time - I'm hesitant to suggest that the entirety of the game might be (among other things) a commentary on the economy... but... yeah...That is not meant to excuse any sort of criticism that could be laid on the game - neither is the relatively cheap asking price - it is simply an, er, evaluation of the game. I liked it - some won't - some will - Nyeh.Gameplay:You click on people, hear conversations. You click on things, hear commentary. You click on notes, hear summaries. You click on items, you listen to those interactions (would say watch, but there's not much to). You play a simple game of detective.You marvel at Determined Parachute, whether in a good or bad light. I recommend this game to the certain few who can dig something different.Oh and (a voice that sounds like) Zimos from Saints Row is in the game. So. And there's a  bagpipe. And Twilight gets made fun of. "

It was well displayed in the video on the store page. On the other hand, all this game was was clicking around and following a storyline. There was nothing outside of the story, and there was no real way to interact with it. In my opinion, if there were some puzzles or something to involve me more, I would have loved it.

I like the idea of a musical detective feature, and didn't mind the singing (even though it was off key), but for the most part the characters are literally singing about not much at all. I suppose that this was intentional, but it ended up being more irritating than quirky. All in all not a bad attempt at a quirky point and click adventure but the storyline needed more refinement before release. 5/10 "

												I got this game for my birthday from my friends, and to celebrate - I played the game and streamed it all in one sitting.It started out as a funny joke that most likely result n my suffering but to my surprise, the game was pleasantly amusing. All if not most of the dialogue was voice acted or sung and each bit was humourous, quirky, or clever. I'm not one for musicals, or things being sung overly much or at all in media but the style of the game grew on me. I do play music so I have a decent sense of styles and the scores in Dominique Pamplemousse were effective at creating atmosphere and characters.(Some people may find the 'music' offensive but I guess my attitude at the time helped to remove a lot of stigme which allowed me to actually 'enjoy' the game as what it is)The plot slowly builds as you progress through the game and it gains a bit of depth, twisting a few times, before ending.After reminiscing about the game for quite a while, I wish the game had a bit more to its ending.All in all, the game is niche, probably not for all, but if you're looking for something REALLY borderline.... everything, go ahead and try it.

												Got the game originally as I was really intrigued by the game from the trailer,  liking both the art of stop-motion and adventure games...the story is basic but carries the game ok, puzzles are reasonable, and it could be a fun little game... however it's also a musical of sorts, and the singing....To be fair it's not the worst singing, but it's still very off key, loud, and often out of tune. If it only happened occasionally it would still be ok,  even slightly funny...but when almost every single conversation is sung ( and there is a lot of talking) it gets a little grating ...that said I was willing to plough through regardless just to see how the story ended, and I'd guess I got about halfway, but then the game crashed and exited unexpectedly and I hadn't saved for awhile.... I'm still trying to work up the resolve to replay back to where I was before and continue....Its not all bad (although not great either),  its good points are its quirky and the style has a certain strange charm.....but for the sake of your ears I'd  play in short bursts if you do decide to give it a try and FOR THE LOVE OF SANITY remember to save after progress is made, just in case.

												Incredibly charming little point and click game. Rather fun. Visuals aren't gob-blasting but perfectly stylized for this game. Fun little detective story, a little short, but nonetheless fun. Music is pretty good and the soundtrack is pretty sweet. The aesthetic design, characters, music, and story blend all together into a nice small game.This isn't for everyone though, if you can't stand musicals or characters singing every other line you will absolutely hate this. Definitely worth sale price though if you can dig a quirky musical point and click. Hell it's worth full price!Now pay your damn rent pimple mush or i'm kicking you to the curb			"

It. Is. Horrible. Someone should sue the maker for the singing. Guantanamo could extract valuable information from prisoners with this creation.Also the constant hammering of the gender agenda makes it irritating and stupid. WE GET IT, she's an ugly girl so she decided to go for some fashionable ""you are so stuck up to try to box my gender in, also you are all some-kind-of-phobiacs"" cliché.It is beyond bad, it is ""I don't want to live on this planet"" bad.PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE PROJECTS.

												The primary accomplishment in Dominique Pamplemousse isn’t gameplay. It’s character. Dominique Pamplemousse believes so strongly in its characters that everything else — even gameplay — is secondary. Tons of gameplay hours, plenty of missions and activities with an awesome collection of vehicles of various modes of transportation and a large array of firearms put the grandeur once again into Dominique Pamplemousse. This game deserves a better user score. I hope nobody takes it serious, because there are a lot of butthurt fakevotes.Well to the game. This is the Dominique Pamplemousse you've always been waiting for! Yes it's true. You loved San Andreas because of gameplay? You loved Vice City because of music and atmosphere? Dominique Pamplemousses innovation? Dominique Pamplemousse's story? Well I'll explain.This Dominique Pamplemousse brings it all together. The playing of three characters at once goes really smooth, it feels just how it should be, shooting and driving is really fun, it's kinda a mix between the realistic driving in Dominique Pamplemousse, arcade driving in Midnight Club, and shooting from Max Payne 3, and this is perfect!The missions are fun again, many people thought Dominique Pamplemousse had too similar missions, and I thought so too, but now you'll never get bored I assure you! The story is really well written, won't write more about that cause there is a lot to spoiler.As many a gamer have stopped by to pen thoughts on this game so shall I .Simply put Dominique Pamplemousse is my game of the year since i am going to avoid cod ghosts. The story-line is epic and the characters are hilarious.The story is very well written If you take time to do side quests you will enjoy the main missions even more and boy are they enthralling.Whats not to like thinks to shoot and people to blow up... EPIC.The world is really massive, the countryside isn't boring at all, and seriously, who wasn't missing that after Dominique Pamplemousse? I don't know how R* did this, but even the graphics improved, while the game is bigger over all.You can do so much stuff in Los Santos and it's countryside, it's unbelievable that it is just one game! I played for at least 20 hours now, and I have so much more to see and explore, just crazy!Well what else can I say? Buy it Play it yourself and agree! It's a really good gameWhen analyzed in its purest essence, Dominique Pamplemousse not only proves to be an excellent title, but also a game that is able to make a sublime parody of today's society, taking advantage of all the excesses and insanities to which the world is slowly getting used. xD			"

												A short little musical adventure, with some surprisingly deep commentary and many layers. The claymation is raw and some of the voices work better than others (Prudence and Casey are my favourites), but it is an extremely impressive line-up for coming from just one voice actor/singer/musician.I enjoy the off-hand jokes, the quirky dialogue, the tunes and the extreme meta-ness of a musical game commenting on auto-tune.the ending features one of my favourite ""get out of jail"" puzzles of all time! *Bleeert*At one and a half hour, it provides a short, quirky and fun romp, that might leave you with more philosphical questions than you assumed going in. It's also a well-written who-done-it - the game is very aware of its own short-cuts, and doesn't take itself too seriously.- Happy original IndieGogo backer. :)			"

Out of the deep sprawling darkness draws a sweet detective coat, granting DP the powers to combat tough challenges like paying the rent!!!With new found powers at DP's side, travel through a whole handful of stages as you click on all the options.Can you bring justice to the corrupt musical industry?Can you reunite fluffnificent and DP?CAN YOU SURVIVE THE GAME WITHOUT STABBING YOURSELF IN THE EARS!?Can you muster the strength to last the game's exorbitant length of 2 WHOLE FRIKKEN HOURS!?And will education ever actually be affordable?Conclusion:10/10 It's okay.

												Have you ever played a Point and Click game? how about a Point and Click game with every animation made out of clay? What if i ask, if you played a Point a Click Musical game. If you answered no to both of those questions i wouldn’t be 100% surprised. Dominique Pamplemousse is probably the first of it’s kind that i have ever seen. A point and click detective musical game. it’s sort of hard to picture it while i even write it down; and I’ve played the game. But Dominique Pamplemousse has heart thats heading towards the right direction of innovation, creativity and a bit of nonsense. First of sure Dominique Pamplemousse is NOT a fun game to play. It is as basic as a point and click game can be. You see something out of the ordinary and “boom!” you click it. The only difference in this game, is that almost ever dialogue is sang in a musical tune. Crazy as it sounds the game does have plenty of character. Although it seems that there is only one voice actor for ALL 9 or so characters, you can tell that the developer of this game had a blast making it. As i said earlier the game is all animated in clay. As odd as it is, the animation sorta fits with the musical theme. sorta not that great. There isn’t lip moving when the characters talk, instead they just move the mouth up and down over and over. The singing in the game is extraordinarily terrible! A lot of off keys, and most of the time it feels like the singing is forced into saying words really quickly just to keep up the tune. Aside from all of that i was really quit interested in the story. Sure a lot of points the story is very cliche, but once the game was over i was feeling for some more Pamplemousse action and of course singing. I hope the developer doesn’t quit on this style of game. Unfortunately we live in a time where there isn’t as many creativity in video games as there use to be, and this game really brought a smile to my face to know it’s not gone. I’m glad a game like this exits and i hope to see more, but maybe next time, i would like it longer then 1hr and of course with more voices. I definitely want people to play this game, it’s $5 right now for the deluxe edition which includes the SHEET MUSIC (come on, how many games come with sheet music) and soundtrack. As i said, i WANT people to play this. I don’t expect people to like it and i understand but it just seems like a game, personally to me, that i did not want to miss.			"

There are many things I would like to say about this game, but I am unable to create such an emotion response using simple words, many of you may think that this game looks bad based off trailers, but ask yourself how many times have you thought something was bad until you tried it. If you give this game a chance it will definetly mold you into a better human being, it teach you so many deep things about yourself and what you may become. I would say this game deserves to be game of the year, for its simple yet elegant design in our gaming era. I would highly recommend everyone to play this game.			"

												An entertaining little linear musical detective story that touches on Gender issues and which I'm sure has already baffled and enraged certain corners of the Internet purely by it's existence. The fact that the singing is horribly off-key just makes it more endearing :)It's worth knowing up front that it's a very short experience (about 30min if you feel the need to rapidly click your way through it - an hour and a half or so for everyone else) but worth a look if you're interest in something that's very unique and witty.

												This is a short adventure which manages to deal with gender politics, the music industry and wider economy all with a healthy sense of humour. There are several reviews condemning the poor vocal performances - this is contextual, which might seem like a cop-out, but it works very well. This and the art style are matters of aesthetic sensibility, and personally I found this game quaint, weird and wonderful. My only complaint is the cuts between dialogue and song, which are roughly chopped together. Generally I think this is a highly imaginative, instantly immersive experiment.			"

												As a fan of the point and click genre when I saw this crop up I just had to give it a go, and for the most part I wasn't disappointed.By that I mean I wasn't expecting great things from it. It's been made by one person whom from what I can tell, hasn't made a game before. It's got all the thing you expect as standard in a point and click game. Although it was refreshing to not have to do the ""try to combine everything with everything else in your inventory"" trick.This actually game actually has you checking around your surroundings, though those are small and it's not exactly hard to work out what's important in the room.I like the fact this game was created using actual physical materials and animated in stop motion. As I mentioned above it does mean that objects of importance are very easy to spot though. The sad thing is that the weakest element of the game is what it sells it self as, it's a musical. Unfortunately the songs grate quickly and the the singing isn't exactly at a professional standard. I don't know if that's intentional (due to the storyline etc) but I found I had to actually turn off the speakers at times.The storyline is interesting, but I found quite easy to guess the plot twist. The game is also quite short, I completed it in just over an hour. I would not recommend getting this at the current price (£3.49) wait until it comes on a steam sale.So my verdict. Get it if you want something unique and interesting. But don't expect a lot.			"

												For me, playing Dominique Pamplemousse was like watching one of those bad yet gloriously awesome old movies.From the off-key singing voices, jerky claymation, and zany music, this off-beat musical comedy point and click game is very enjoyable. Admittedly it's a little on the short side. However the price is fitting for the amount of content.While it is a point-and-click there isn't really an inventory system like most adventure games and almost no puzzles. It's mostly dialog and environment manipulation.I like it (mostly for the singing and clay animation) but I can see how it may not be to everyone's liking.			"

												At just over an hour long, this musical click adventure, featuring the non-binary private eye Dominique Pamplemousse, is an experience that should not be missed. Perhaps very niche in appeal, I have to say I spent the entire time with a smile on my face, especially bopping along to the Kimya Dawson-eque songs. We need more musical games featuring non-binary heros!			"

												Short Tale Full of CharmFirst off, Broken Age this is not. It's production values won't wow you, but I imagine if you're looking at these reviews considering a purchase you are already past that barrier. What you want to know is if it's worth your time, and to that I would say yes.It's a humble game, made with the inherently humble medium of clay animation. It's difficult to say much about it without spoiling the game(it's only a little over an hour long!) but you will be following the life of Dominique as she tries to solve a perplexing case, learning much about the little dramas/issues of the people involved, and making difficult choices regarding integrity towards the end. Though a bit repetitive, I liked the music and it does it's job of enhancing the quirky feel. My main complaint is some of the themes touched upon don't get time to be fleshed out as much as they could, but perhaps the fact that it doesn't belabor it's points is exactly what makes it a nice little ride.It's great, short, charming fun for an audience that can appriciate weird things. It's not for everyone, but it's made with heart, and we need more games like that.			"

												Don't listen to the ""top"" reviews (which are the only negative one, by the way), this is a really nice game !You have to realize this was basically done by one person with the help of a few others. I really admire the developer, she put that game together by herself and it must have taken a lot of time and dedication ! It's truly amazing to me.I really don't have anything negative to say about this game. I think the singing is funny and charming, In fact, the whole game is funny and charming ! It's a bit short, yes, but it's definitely not outrageously so.What do people expect of a game made by one person and that costs $5 ? I think you should definitely try it if you don't take yourself or games too seriously and if you want to support the work of hard-working independant developers !Have fun !			"

												What do you get when you mix claymation, musical writing, and simple point-and-click mechanics together with a surreal-seeming aesthetic and slightly wonky humour?Well, if you knew, I'd like you to tell me. However, what we have on hand here is Dominique Pimp-...Pampel-...Pumpernick..Whatever. A Flash game created by an independant games designer with an ear for catchy tunes and memorable lyrics.This game is presented in the style of clayfighters 64, or The Neverhood, with a heavily Noire-ish turn and grayscale colouration. The character figurines are rough, simple and yet manage to be recognisable and easily identifyable. This is helped in no small part by the voice acting, with varied voices provided for all the characters. While certain characters' voices might fall apart in some musical segments, on the whole, the song fragments are well-written and do a fine job of explaining the situation or the topic presented.The story follows Dominique, the PI of indeterminate gender with an effeminate voice on his/her mission to find a missing pop star. The story does play into some twists and turns, and while some of them are obvious, or heavily foreshadowed, none of them are jarring with the story. The game is heavily linear, though, with only a single solution present to each puzzle until the ultimate choice at the end. So unless you wish to trawl for trading cards, there's very little reason to replay the game.if you like musicals, or games with a certain sense of silliness about them, then this game may be for you, if you can forgive the fact it's coded in flash. (encoded rather loudly, I might add) For veteran point-and-click gamers, though, it will ultimately prove to be a relatively shallow entry into the genre, carried somewhat by a fun and catchy musical score.My positive reccomendation, then, does have some caveats to it. If you play an instrument, splurge on the sheet music for a few short pieces to play.			"

												Dominique Pamplemousse reminded me of of the investigation portions in the Phoenix Wright games. It's the type of game where it's more of a visual novel, with not much in the way puzzles or logic tricks that you would expect from the average point-and-click adventure.  There are often moments where characters are having a conversation, and you are essentially just clicking the ""next"" button to hear the rest of it.This is by no means a bad thing, though. A video game format can be used to deliver a story in a more nonlinear way that wouldn't be possible in any other medium. Just don't go in expecting much challenge.The story itself actually had me pretty entertained and interested all the way through, with the twists and mysteries in the story being pulled off surprisingly well. There were also a few clever lines that ranged from making me smile to letting out a little chuckle.I really enjoyed the musical element of the game. There's background music on each screen, and on some dialogue options, the characters will sing their lines in time with the music. The singing itself can be a little off-key at times, but I honestly enjoyed that. It added some charm. I'd really like to see the ""singing along with the background music"" done more in games. The background music is also really charming by itself, and I rather wish the soundtrack available for purchase would have included the instrumentals.The game's description says it is a game about ""gender and the economy"", and while these subjects are touched on a few times, it's usually little more than a mention, and doesn't end up affecting the plot at much, which was a little disappointing. The game is really more about corporate intrigue and the music industry.Dominique Pamplemousse is a fairly short game, clocking in at a little over an hour for me, and zero replayability, but for only five bucks, I would recommend it if you like mysteries and visual novels.

												Weird game.. graphics and sound (especially the ""singing"") are.. hard to stand from time to time but also very charming.Even though the game is very short (took me about 90 minutes to finish) it's definitly worth a watch. The whole design is one of a kind and once you've become familiar with all that off-tune singing you might really enjoy the game. If you're into artsy stuff, go check it out.

												It's a very brief detective noir story with a particularly eccentric lead character. The narrative is very brisk and yet still twisty, and the characters find the time to still surprise you in this brief jaunt. You might be put off by the simplistic and choppy claymation style as well as the off-key singing, but this is really better than the sum of its parts.I would have trouble suggesting this if you are judging games by length per US dollar... but if you like a good, simple story without too much in the way of runaround and overt time-wasting, it's a good hour and change well spent. It won't challenge you to figure out its few puzzle solutions much, but that's hardly the point. It's still cheaper than a day at the movies.			"

												I greatly enjoyed my time with this game, though a few things must be noted. One, is that the game is both relatively straight forward and short. I wouldn't go as far as to call it a 'walking simulator' but it certainly isn't full of the puzzles you would typically find in an adventure game.Also, if you have a strong aversion to tone deaf singing STAY AWAY. This game will make you cry! Though it was done on purpose it still made me cringe more than once.Despite all this though I had fun. The game is charming, interesting and unlike anything I've seen before. I consider it worth a playthrough.			"

												Dominique Pamplemousse is a wonderfully written game about a non-bianary gendered dectective Dominique Pamplemousse who (while behind on their bills), gets hired by the owner of a record label to track down one of her missing stars, Casey Bingham. This is a point and click game with a very lovely old-school claymation animation style, all done in black and white. When you ask characters questions, they explain in song as well, which I think is a really nice touch!All in all, Dominique Pamplemousse is a really fun game, with great characters, and the fact that the main character is a non-binary gendered character really makes me happy (representation is important, yo!). All the characters that I've encountered are unique and well-fleshed out, and you learn facts about them all over the story, keeping the investigation alive, all while keeping you wondering how it all connects.I highly reccomend this game if you want something different than your traditional point-and-click affairs, or if you want to see a non-binary character shine!

												My only complaint about Dominique Pamplemousse is that it's too short.I enjoy the art and music styles for their handcrafted charm, but I really enjoy the what we learn - and infer - from playing through the game. I find the broad spectrum of real, normal, broken, annoying people to be refreshing - this is not a game that plays to the status quo of hetero-normative, masculine-centered culture that most gamers would like to imagine is real. Instead, we're thrust into the middle of a world where the protagonist just has better things to do than worry about gender identities and where every character has obvious fatal flaws.Is this game for everyone? No, probably not. People who are incredibly judgmental and don't have the spark to enjoy unique creations from others should probably stick to mainstream titles. But for those who like to experience new and different things, this game is a brief look at the design skills of an up-and-coming Indie darling. The future looks very bright for Deirdra Kiai Productions.			"

												Stop motion animation, Adventure games, and musicals are three of my favorite things. So, what happens when you throw them all in a blender? Magic, right? Well, kinda.Dominique Pamplemousse in “It’s All Over Once The Fat Lady Sings!” is a combination of all those things. Using real clay characters, animated in the stop motion style, Pamplemousse tells the story of wealth inequality, gender politics, and detective work, while having the characters break out into song.At times, this makes the game transcend all media I have seen, while you and your angry landlord have a singing fight while you run around the apartment looking for money, while at times, it hits the wrong note, sometimes quite literally.The voices, including the singing ones are all done by one person, and all are ""in character"" when they sing, which unfortunately makes encounters with characters unbearable, as the teenager predictably has voice cracks, pops, and is generally off key quite a bit.There's evidence in the game to support the theory that the unprofessional singing, and out of key songs is intentional, but it still is incredibly off putting when it rears it's head.The art style is unique to say the least. This isn't the first time an adventure game, or any game for that matter has been stop motion animated, but each puppet is stylized as if it was made in pre-school, and the rest of the game tries to follow suit. Compared to the serious model quality of Aardmann (Wallace and Gromit) or Laika (Coraline), it's a refreshing take on the way stop motion models are made and animated, each character only having a few key frames of animation they run through. The gameplay is less adventure game than I would have hoped. There are objects in the few environments that the game throws at you, that you can click on and interact with, and there are 2 light puzzles that shouldn't be too hard to get past. The rest of the game is carried out through dialogue boxes, where you interrogate people with the evidence you have found so far, occasionally causing a character or 2 to break out in song, singing about their feelings on a topic. Dominique Pamplemousse is nominated for 4 IGF awards including the grand prize, and it's easy to see why: its fresh, clever, and thoughtful. However at times, it falls short of being astonishing, and ends up being mostly OK, with a few really great parts thrown in.If you like strange, experimental games, you should probably give Pamplemousse a shot, its out there, clever, occasionally funny, and presents an interesting idea to the table: a musical video game. If it looks too strange for you, it probably is. It's quirky and weird, and that just may be it's downfall.			"

												Interesting game, but not the best.It was somewhat humorous. I really liked the fact you can't identify the sex of the main character. The jokes that revolve around that are the best ones.The story was OK, with some nice twists to it.The singing is not as annoying as I'd expected it to be, but it does make the gameplay slow, though.Basically, you walk around, asking people for information so you can progress in your investigation. And that's it. People will answer you in singing (generally), and from time to time I caught myself thinking ""could you SING any slower?"". Of course, I thought that with Chandler's voice in my head, which made me laugh a little bit.Anyway...It's a very short game. I've finished it in less than 90 minutes. Even though it's not the best Point & Click out there, it did entertain me quite a bit. It's not an expensive game, so yeah, I'd recomment it.			"

												Dominique Pamplemousse was a bit different than the usual game. I do appreciate it for its uniqueness. It's essentially a really stripped down adventure game. It's in black and white, claymation and the characters sing a lot of the dialogue. There's kind of an inventory. Mainly there's just topics of conversation to try with different characters. I had a fun time with it for the hour and a half that it took to finish. No doubt it helped that I was drinking beers while playing it, but it was amusing. I appreciate that it strikes out from the cookie-cutter mold and offers something new, albeit also something basic. The twist of the story is a bit unlikely and convenient. The singing was proficient. Sometimes really entertaining, sometimes not so much. I can see how a lot of people really won't like this game at all. I still did, though. If you're still interested after reading the description of the game, then go for it. It's quite a bit different than you're used to and it won't take too much of your time.			"

 OMG, This game is a diamond in the rough! It's so unique, different, a bit of an oddball, AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT AMAZING. It just embodies the spirit of an indie game. The claymation is wonky (but entertaining) and the story is totally random and just plain silly... I love it and if you have a young heart like I do then I think you will love it too.			"

												Uhm..first things first.If you liked the Phoenix Wright series on DS, you may actually somewhat like this.I will give them props for actually including singing and voice acting, however the game itself is entirely too short.It is somewhat easy, and not really hard, though, most people from what I've seen, myself included, could easily see, how this game could be a let down to the average gamer. It is way too silly and corny. I get it, thats actually the selling point to this game really, because if it didn't have that then it wouldn't really be useful at all.I personally had a laugh at this game, though I do find it questionable in its fullest.I really cannot recommend this game really because I dunno how people would react. Especially those who actually look at my reviews and so on know, that they may actually be completely turned off by this game.Also side note. I actually don't remember buying this outright, so it might of been part of a humble bundle or something, So in that, i actually say its worth checking out if your actually really, REALLY, bored. But overall, if you like action games, this isn't for you, at all.Also lastly, a major bug, Due to the fact that the game is running in a Flash player(extremely resource heavy) It maybe portable to different Operating Systems, but Steam just can't handle it, and ends up crashing outright if you open the overlay, so be mindful to actually tab out of this one.So. 5/10, heres whyOn the upside, its an actually developed story that will keep you interested if you can stomach the over dramatic opera formality we have within this game.Its a Indie that actually looks somewhat okay, though, nothing thats crazily over the top or good.Its a different change of pace from pretty much everything else.But on the badsIts voice acting might throw a lot of people off if they are not willing to actually sit there and stomach it.Its really short of a story.It can be really hard to get working(game wise, depending on other users computer systems) "

												This game for me is the definition of heartfelt.Yeah, so, it's a little rough. It takes some adjusting too. But its short enough that the music quality (a running gag through-out, you'll find) doesn't detract too much. The plot is clever, it's a quirky kind of funny.Plus, you get a refreshing game where there are no male characters! (Dominique appears to be genderfluid/genderqueer, but we do never learn their preferred pronouns, so I could stand corrected).Long and short: If you think you might like it from the trailer, I GUARANTEE that you will.But if you're hoping that the game will sell itself to you, well.

												This is less a game and more a musical/claymation/detective story.  Let's break it down.  This game is short.  Like, seriously short.  You'll be done before you know it.  It's got weird looping music, (unskippable!) off-key songs for no reason, and jokes that aren't funny.  It's got monochromatic backgrounds and grainy textures and blobby characters that don't move around a whole hell of a lot.  There's only a handful of puzzles, and those are easy, and not too many locations.  There's no character development to speak of.  There's a few inexplicable plot twists and the ending is weak.I couldn't stop playing it, and I enjoyed every second.RECOMMENDED: To hipsters and children.			"

												There's two ways the game can go for you. This will either be a charming, lovable, funny little game. Or an annoying, boring, droned out mess. For me personally, it's certainly the first option. The game is VERY linear. It isn't really hard. It isn't all that long either. Knowing all the right options you could probably beat the game in like, 30 minutes. Many people are complaining about the awful singing. These people have missed the gag in that. The singing is supposed to be bad, that's the comedy of it. I feel as if the story is pretty original for what it is. I've always had an interest in stop motion animation this game has....LIMITED stop motion. Typically the same re-hashed animations in different scenes. If there was a nit pick problem from me this would probably be it. You really start to notice the reuse of animations and it gets a little bland in that respect. But the charm of the backdrops, characters, designs, and soundtrack make up for it. The soundtrack fits the atmosphere the game is going for very well. It's weird, wonky, and oddly amusing to listen to. However, staying in one area for too long. You'll notice the looping nature of the tracks, which CAN get a bit grating. The games fun comes from the humor in the characters jokes, as well as the laughs from the absolutely awful singing. Overall, the good outweighs the bad. If quirky small projects with quaint little attempts at humor is your thing, then this game would be for you. However, if musicals, claymation, simple games, or kinda blander humor aren't your thing skip past this game.Overall for me 8/10 Would buy again.			"

												Fun and unique point-and-click that admittedly gave little challenge and was only an hour long, but provided an interesting plot with eccentric singing characters. I'd reccomend checking out the trailer before purchasing, as if you don't like the comedic feel then you probably will want to rip your hair out after 10 minutes. I personally loved the crude music and aesthetic, it made the game really charming and reminiscent of early Aardman stuff (but nowhere near the animation level :D).			"

												Wow! What a pleasant surprise, this game. It is like an amateur-interactive-musical-detective-story-game and that made me so relaxed and happy. No, it's not the best looking, best playing or sounding game ever, obviously, but it is so much fun to play. And the musical aspect of it is, quite frankly, surprisingly not-irritating at all! This is an original game that you HAVE to try if you want to play something completely different from the mainstream, but that is so fulfilling and entertaining in it's own way. And the story was actually good too! Highly recommended.			"

												I'm not sure if ""adventure game"" is the right label for it, but I enjoyed Dominique Pamplemousse for what it was. From the continuous off-key singing to the charming stop motion clay animation, the game endeared itself to me and sweetened the deal with a protagonist with a sense of humor and a lack of respected pronouns. While I was disappointed by its shortness and clunky story delivery, I was never bored with this unique little point-and-click, and I'll probably pick up the soundtrack because I enjoyed the catchiness of the music. My only genuine complaint was the game's illusion of choices when you in fact have absolutely none -- something that wouldn't have been frustrating at all if it had been longer or could be failed (such as by arousing suspicions by asking the wrong questions, something that is actually present in the game but is stopped by Dominique announcing they won't make such a mistake.) The addition of easter eggs, more story, or additional game art would have done this game a great deal of good. All in all, not quite worth its asking price of $4.99 save for the fact that its creator absolutely should go on to make better, more extensive games in the future, because the talent and ingenuity is clearly present. Snag it on sale, or damn the economy and support a genuinely unique indie title that's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off bunches of dudebro gamers.			"

Most of dialog are sung by characters, what is annoying sometimes, you need to wait to character finnish her role.

To be bold there's nothing specially creative or unique that makes this game stand out compared to other cardobard stop motion video games out there but that's fine, it's still a good game. It starts off a bit slow and I thought of just closing the game after the first minutes but I didn't and in the end I don't regret it. It's a game that doesn't try to be amazing, it's a simple unpretentious game that tries to be just good, and it is.			"

												It's a fun little game to kill time, the black and white claymation aesthetics are interesting, and I thought the singing was pretty quirky and cute, but the singing may not be for everyone since it could be irritating to some.This game was going pretty good for me personally, at least til I reached the end. It was totally abrupt and unexpected, and went by way too quick. It was as if the game didn't really have a climax to begin with. I was interested in the plot but for it to end so suddenly and badly really takes points off from the game. The two endings were also determined by two simple choices at the end and both of them used the same two scenes only with different dialouge to refer to the opposing context.Eh, either way I'll put ""Yes"" for this game because I thought the claymation must've taken forever and it was a general fun game to play regardless. I hope to see a longer sequel of this (and with a proper ending, too!) "

												Interesting game, but not the best.It was somewhat humorous. I really liked the fact you can't identify the sex of the main character. The jokes that revolve around that are the best ones.The story was OK, with some nice twists to it.The singing is not as annoying as I'd expected it to be, but it does make the gameplay slow, though.Basically, you walk around, asking people for information so you can progress in your investigation. And that's it. People will answer you in singing (generally), and from time to time I caught myself thinking ""could you SING any slower?"". Of course, I thought that with Chandler's voice in my head, which made me laugh a little bit.Anyway...It's a very short game. I've finished it in less than 90 minutes. Even though it's not the best Point & Click out there, it did entertain me quite a bit. It's not an expensive game, so yeah, I'd recomment it.			"

												TL;DR: Weird but interesting game. Give it a try.Full review:First off, I'll say I'd have never bought this game looking at the description and the trailer, which is what I usually look at when deciding whether to buy a game or not. This said, let me add the fact that I LOVED the game. I got it from a Humble Bundle, played the games from the bundle I was actually interested at and let this one sit in my library for about a year. When I finally decided to play it, I found funny conversations, naïve out-of-tone singing and cute stop-motion animations. Even my girlfriend, who typically neither plays videogames nor finds them interesting, loved it. About two hours of strategy-free point-and-clicking will lead you to the two possible endings (none of them are very good, I must admit). The game has no difficulty whatsoever (except maybe two or three parts), which in my opinion is not necessarily bad for a game that essentially aims to storytelling, rather than challenge. In general, it is a game I'd recommend you to play, under the warning that, as some other comment already stated, you either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it.			"

												Dominique Pamplemousse was a bit different than the usual game. I do appreciate it for its uniqueness. It's essentially a really stripped down adventure game. It's in black and white, claymation and the characters sing a lot of the dialogue. There's kind of an inventory. Mainly there's just topics of conversation to try with different characters. I had a fun time with it for the hour and a half that it took to finish. No doubt it helped that I was drinking beers while playing it, but it was amusing. I appreciate that it strikes out from the cookie-cutter mold and offers something new, albeit also something basic. The twist of the story is a bit unlikely and convenient. The singing was proficient. Sometimes really entertaining, sometimes not so much. I can see how a lot of people really won't like this game at all. I still did, though. If you're still interested after reading the description of the game, then go for it. It's quite a bit different than you're used to and it won't take too much of your time.			"

Is a solid experience which tries to work as a musical, and thanks to its short length the constant singing won't become tiresome. Is not a complicated game and overall very easy to follow, making it more of a 'click to continue story' rather an adventure game.However the game runs in Flash and has some bugs. In my case i got a gamebreaking bug which made me restart the game. And since you can't skip singing dialog i had to end the final scene watching it in a playthrough rather spend another hour of the same.Is a game not really worth the time for its gameplay or plot, but atleast tries to be unique and somehow achieves it. If anything having a main character of ambiguous gender is greatly welcome nowadays.			"

												I am a huge fan of anything stop-motion animated, I enjoy musicals, and bizarre indie games are a guilty pleasure for me.  It should have been impossible for me to dislike this game, but instead, it ended up being one of the worst I've ever played.  I really and truly wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt, but try as I might, I could not find a single redeeming quality.The first thing that hits you is the singing.  To call the singing 'music' would be quite generous indeed- the choice of notes breaks every musical convention, but that is overshadowed by the fact that the voice actor can't hit a note to save her life.  The rhythm is all but indiscernible, and the rhyming is strained at the best of times.  The fact that they're selling the soundtrack is a smack in the face.The stop-motion is rough as well...  it seems like the developer only chose stop-motion because drawing the characters would have actually been more time-consuming.  There is a fine line between “artistically simplistic” and “shoddy,” and this game qualifies as the latter.The game says it's about gender and the economy, but the only mention of gender is a running gag that nobody knows the gender of the main character. My suspicion is that the developer has some personal opinions on gender ambiguity, and I can sympathize with the sentiment, but it seems tacked onto the game, and serves no real purpose towards the plot.  Games with political undertones have their place, especially in the indie community, but it has to be done well.  In that respect, this game fails miserably.My final advice is this: don't play the game.  But if you do, just to see what it's about, don't allow yourself to think “it's starting out bad, but it'll probably get better!”  It doesn't.  Feel free to quit at any time...  you're not missing anything.			"
