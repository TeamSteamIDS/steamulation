												The game has been abandoned by the original Devs and they've hired another guy to basically do little more than bug fix.  The addition of new features is a pipe dream that will likely never come true.  Over a year ago the original devs were promising all sorts of things (""Both seamonsters AND weather are already on the drawing board. Expect them within a month or so!"" - December 2013).  None of these things happened and were lies.The game has Three locations and that is it.  Islands, where you kill anyone on it.  Sea battles, where you just board a ship or shoot it.  Town islands, where you buy things and hire new pirates.  At the start the game is pretty fun until you realise this is literally all there is to the game, the mechanics do not develop, new things are not introduced.  You will do the same thing you did in hour 1 in hour 100 (Other than shoot cannons).  Cannon fights are ridiculous, you could spend tens of hours collecting a crew, training them, equipping them and yet in a single cannon fight many of them will die, making all your hard work pointless.There is no real plot.  No real characters.  The music is average.  The graphics are frankly lazy, every island is the same and the background for the world is always the same.  The gameplay is basic (You order your entire crew with 1 click..you cannot individually select) and it does not develop.  Frankly, the Devs should be ashamed for cashing in on an idea and then abandoning it, breaking hundreds of promises they made and hiring some random guy to do little more than take the blame.  Don't buy the game, the developers don't deserve the money and it sends out the wrong message if you do so.Edit: After announcing they were making a new game and seeing the negative reception it got, they announced a ""free redux edition"" for the game a week later, in an attempt to win back fans.   This doesn't change my review.  The game is still currently poor, was released unfinished and it's taken the dev 6 months of silence before announcing anything.  A games review is a review of the game; not future promises.			"

												I played this a bunch when my internet was out since it was relatively small (~200 MB) and wouldn't kill my phone's data plan to tether and install. Because of this, my time played isn't accurate - I have about another 10 hours in this game and currently on day 13 of my second save.Anyway, on with this. First off, there's a lot to like here: -Pirates -Roguelike -Customizeable crew and ship -Characters level up, have equipment and skills -Freeform explorationBut it's just not very good. I waited until it was out of ""early access"" in hopes to avoid a lot of problems, but alas, here I am. Anyway, the bad: -Only the captain is able to follow orders directly - group orders for crew is haphazard at best. -Crew that learn skills for the ship (cooking, cleaning) will do them on their own accord. In other words: even if the food stores are full of uncooked food and you have a cook, if he's too busy punting♥♥♥♥♥♥off the side of the ship he won't go near it. This has improved with 1.0.5, but can still be an issue for pirates with multiple skills for the ship. -Cooks sometimes won't cook food. So your ship starves to death for absolutely no reason. As it stands in my save now I have around 40 in fish that's uncooked in barrels, with 3 cooks refusing to do anything. (This has been fixed as of 1.0.5 - pirates that don't have the ability to fish or clean but can cook will now do so) -Multiple crew with the ""cleaning"" skill doesn't make the job go faster. They all scuttle after the same turd and fight over it. -Managing more than a few crew is a nightmare when it comes to moral and hunger. -""Animals"" tend to charge in to battle. This includes chickens you're rasing for eggs. They don't survive long, and don't listen to orders very well. This makes capturing animals borderline pointless because they will suicide at the first chance they get when your ship gets boarded. -Custom ship designs tend to screw up pathfinding for your crew. Expect to get stuck. A lot. Don't worry, though! If you grind your ship down to a nub it'll probably fix. Also, the dimensions aren't clear. You'll be building this sweet skiff and all of a sudden you're unable to build in a direction anymore, so you have to restart your design taking in to account this invisible wall. I'd like a grid or something, please. -It's easier to pump up a captain and have him handle mobs of enemies, since he listens to orders. -Combat, both island and ship to ship is largely ""rinse and repeat"". Cannons are fired in a short volley and then sides clash. Fun for the first few hours, gets kind of grating. No events or anything to speak of so far, at least in my playthroughs. -Many of the items found don't work properly. Sushi, for example. -The sound effects get old real quick. ""JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER."" -The inventory gets cumbersome when you pick up a lot of items. It requires a trip to the store to be able to see all of the things you're carrying. -Bounty hunter dialogs are slow and interrupt the player when walking around town. Yes, I know I'm on a ""quest"", stop telling me. On top of that, bounties don't have a set range, and sailing 30 tiles on the map for a bounty is silly. -Pirates aside from captain will render behind the pirate ships, making it very difficult to track your party. New pirates added to the crew after this bug happens will render properly. There is no way to revert the bug via loading or restarting the game. 


What is this, Super Mario Bros. 3? 
A Screenshot of Pixel Piracy
By: Auburok




 -Cannons end up severing parts of the ship you're firing at, which makes boarding a problem since pirates can't cross ""destroyed"" tiles. -I beat the four legendary pirates, but one of the encounters didn't have a captain. I can't ""beat"" the game with this save now as I had no prompt for beating the four pirates and the bay I'm looking for was never marked or mentioned after doing so.Most of this would be better without the bugs, so there's at least hope that'll be enjoyable in the future. Wait for them to fix the game; don't bother with a discount if the problems never get ironed out because it's really frustrating to play a game that is mostly ""difficult"" due to bugs. Like I said: I was hoping this game wouldn't be the bug-fest I heard it was when they finally pushed out of ""early access"", but that's not the case.I'll update this review as things change.			"

												An unfinished, unpolished gem. This could be a really good game, though even after the full release, the game is riddled with bugs and is generally not an enjoyable experience. Many other reviews cover that. This game is a perfect example of the downfalls of early access.One of the developers said this on the forums in response to their supposed shady development: Vitali Kirpu [developer]: ""We are not shady, we have alot of funds to fund pixel piracy development    for the next 1-2 years or so. My point is that it doesnt matter for us if the game is early access or full release, updates will keep coming untill nobody ever plays the game.""Take that however you want.. To me it say's ""keep buying our unfinished game, and in 1-2 years you may have the privilege of a finished product""it's an interesting glimpse of the truth of early acsess on steam. For the few good games that have thrived from early access, we as a community are left with hundreds of games just like pixel piracy. Disappointing.*Update*I'll be fully updating my review once the game is finally completed. A quick glance at the community hub revealed the game to still be riddled with bugs. If the final product is good, i'll recommend it. Untill then, I am reserving any positive judgement.			"

Early Access Review
								Pixel Piracy is a new take on the roguelite genre where you hire a crew of pirates, build your ship and sail off to battle other pirates or raid islands for all their gold and treasure. You can even steal other ships if you want to. As you progress and level up your crew you will be able to increase the size of your boat and crew and plunder more dangerous areas for even greater rewards. There are also other things to consider while playing such as food for the hunger of your crew and paying your crew to increase their morale and upgrading your crews gear.Overall this is a very fun and enjoyable game, the music is also great and I would highly recommend you purchasing it!

												So normally I would write a more concise review analyzing a game, and looking at all the good parts of it but also all of it's faults. Pixel Piracy is this special case where I absolutely adore the concept it delivers and the gameplay, but the execution is so god damn awful I can't bring myself to play it anymore, I wanted to play it to the end and explore everything, have a massive powerful crew that would dominate the seven seas. Instead we're left with a game that, to put it simply, is badly made. It doesn't work, and yet it 'released' mere days ago. Anyway, here's a list of about everything wrong with this game that will ruin your experience. Some issues may not seem important but do realize that all of them create unfair situations where the player is not at fault and yet the game will end up punishing them anyway or worse, just straight up giving them a situation they cannot get out of because of the god awful AI. So, here's the list.-Crew members acknowledge orders for maybe 1 second before ignoring it and going back to doing something that will probably get them killed or worse-Categorizing Crew members doesn't help much because giving them orders is a waste of time when they continue to do whatever the hell they want anyway. This can lead to crew members with no combat experience or health running out against high level pirates for no good reason. The above point also means that no matter how many times you try to move the low level crew member away from combat, they'll still just run back in and get themselves killed.-Your designated cook refuses to cook because you gave him a secondary job role and he's decided that's more important than cooking food for the captain or any of your crew which leads to the unfair death of you or your crew for no good reason other than the fact your cook decided that patching up the tiny bit of damage the ship took is more important than keeping the crew alive. The same goes for the cook having other jobs like Fishing. The same also happens if they're using interactable furniture like a Card set or Set of Swords. Apparently getting that straight flush is more important than helping your captain not starve to death. The same issue can also occur just from having your ship docked at an island, I don't know why it just bloody does.-Crew members who refuse to eat even when he's starving to death and you do actually have supplies of food. This relates to the above problem, if they have any kind of job or they're interacting with something menial, they will refuse to eat even when they're low on health because of starvation. This leads to numerous deaths.-Having multiple people who use cannons and multiple cannons and yet all of the crew members will use the same single cannon which makes it completely redundant, also half of the time a person who can use cannons simply won't for no reason-Crewmembers in combat refusing to target the enemy you picked for more than a second before choosing their own choice, which most of the time is the enemy with the most health instead of focusing down the person you just spent the last 30 seconds wittling down.-Ultimate skills are trash, it's impossible to tell when they're actually being used and that's because most of the time they're never being used, they're pointless and in 30 hours of playing I have only seen a crew member use one once, and it was useless-Selling cargo is useless and yields such a pathetic amount of gold. This is a game based around piracy, where people stole cargo from others to explot for themselves or sell for riches. In this however, you can steal hundreds of weapons, food and all sorts of other stuff and your reward for doing so is 1 gold per weapon no matter how powerful it is.Pixel Piracy is one of the most annoying games I have ever played. It doesn't listen. I don't think I've ever had to complain about a game not listening to me, where the AI is so brain dead that the simplest of concepts is beyond them, and it always ends up punishing you, for the developers misgivings. I can't recommend this game, please don't buy it in it's current state. This review was written as of version 1.0.4Also it took them all the way til 1.0.0 to add quest markers.Really?			"

Early Access Review
								When the Terraria devs posted this game on FB I knew I had to buy it. I wanted to try it for a half hour or so last night before bedtime (10pm), but I couldn't put it down till 4am. Today I'm writing this review at work, and I'm super tired after just a few hours of sleep (probably won't get a lot done today). And yet...I REGRET NOTHING!!!!I have been a gamer for 20+ years, played countless indie games, and I can tell you that this game (even in early access/alpha) is a true gem. In terms of fun and addictiveness, I would rank this game right up there with other indie classics who I've spent hundreds of hours with: like Terraria, Hotline Miami, To The Moon, and Faster Than Light.   HERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO NOTE IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME:- Are there bugs?If you would consider a high level of difficulty, steep learning curve, and a lackluster tutorial to be ""bugs,"" then sure there are bugs. It seems to me like that's the only bugs people are talking about. ""OMG I died in my first encounter, so buggy."" ""I can't figure out how to do anything, too many bugs."" THOSE AREN'T BUGS. In my first 5 or 6 hours of play, I only encountered one actual bug: the game froze up a bit, but I lost no progress as I was able to re-load.- What's it like?Pixel Piracy borrows a lot from other successful, indie roguelikes. It's actually like a mix between Faster Than Light, Terraria, and Sword of the Stars: The Pit. It borrows a lot of concepts from all three games, adds in a few new ideas, and throws it all together in a pirate setting. You travel the world in search of crew, plunder, ship parts, and weapons until you have the most powerful ship in the sea (or galaxy, like Faster Than Light). You travel around a randomized world map in your ship, you click on a spot on the map where there could be a special event, an island, a town, an enemy ship, and etc. Once you have traveled there, that opens up some new spots on the map to explore, and the further out you go, the harder it gets (and there's better plunder). In battle, you have 3 options: flee, blow them away from a safe distance, or board their ship and fight em' up close. All of that is very much like FTL.But unlike FTL, you must build your own custom ship block by block, from the hull to the sails it's all in your hands. This reminds me a lot of building a house in Terraria; there are a lot of things that you will put in your home/ship that have a very specific use and function of course (cannons, ladders, lamps, barrels), but you always end up spending even more time making it look cool, right? Also, there are bosses (huge ships full of bloodthirsty pirates and cannons) on every map. It would be most unfortunate if you just randomly came across them and died, but you are able to see very clearly where they are on the map. Terraria also has many bosses that you can choose to fight when you feel that you're ready. What ship would be fit to sail without a crew? In Pixel Piracy, you must learn to expertly manage a crew of dangerous, unruly, mangy pirates. I can't imagine how that could ever be an easy task. You must keep them fed, paid, happy, clean, and safe. If you fail at any of these task, things will not go well for you. In my opinion, it's much more profitable to train them and keep them alive than it is to replace them. You are also in charge of leveling up and maintaining each individual crew member's abilities: putting points into certain traits, training them to learn new skills, and equipping them with weapons, armor, and items. If anyone reading this has ever played Sword of the Stars: The Pit, all of this should be sounding familiar. Except that you have a whole crew to manage instead of just your captain.- Just how ""Roguelike"" is it exactly?Although it has a lot of FTL (and SPAZ) features like a procedurally generated maps, randomized encounters, and permanent deaths, you can still reload your save from before you died. So even though you don't respawn after death (like Terraria), you also don't die and completely lose all of your progress (like FTL). This is probably a good middle ground to be in for this particular game. Considering that you will spend a LOT more time in Pixel Piracy customizing/upgrading your crew/ship than you would in FTL (which is a shorter game by nature), it's nice that you can re-load your previous save after you're killed in a CRAB BATTLE (not even kidding, those freakin' crabs will drown you man). But at the same time, there is no such thing as a roguelike with respawns. Roguelikes are all about making tough, strategic, and irreversible decisions. If you could just respawn after death, it would completely ruin the whole experience. I wouldn't even be opposed to your save file being erased after death like other roguelikes, but I'm just masochistic like that.    - What tips do I have for you?Don't look anything up. Watch the trailer, look at the screenshots, read the game description, check out a few reviews... then just start playing and don't look back. Don't alt-tab to google and try to search for all the answers, FIGURE IT OUT. I'll admit, a game that doesn't spell everything out for you and hold your hand through the early stages is indeed very old fashioned. This is one of those old school games where you learn by trial and error. How do I get my crew to clean up all this poop on the ship? How do I keep them fed? How do I take on ships that are bigger than mine? FIGURE IT OUT. When you highlight certain items, the description may not necessarily tell you what it does. So buy it and find out. When you come across an island with some shady looking characters you've never seen before, you may not be sure if you can take them or not. Well it's a roguelike, so YOLO. What does that shrine do? What does that potion do? What does that ability/skill do? Try it and find out; it's a lot more fun to learn it on your own.- Should I buy this game?YES			"

												The game has been abandoned in an uplayable state. -DO NOT BUY-. A game breaking bug exists whre the Captain (player character) will get stuck and unable to move, meaning no further progress into the game. This happens arounf level 9. The developers have been silent on this issue long enough to assume the game has been abandoned in its current state. -DO NOT BUY-			"

												Pixel Piracy can be a tough, unforgiving game. There are bugs, and you should expect from an Early Access game, but most of these can be avoided. When you begin a new game, you start on an island with everything you need to get started: a tavern to hire people; a weapons shop to buy better weapons; a food shop to buy some basic food; and a ship building shop where you can buy blocks to be used for your ship. You also start with enough blocks to build a small raft, which will be your ship for until you want to spend the money for more blocks (or by pillaging conquered ships). Using your first small raft, you and your early crew will pillage islands and ships to gather gold and supplies, which can be used to hire more crew, buy food, etc. While you explore the seas, you will come across inhabited islands that have services you can buy from (these islands are identified by a special icon). These islands will often have materials you couldn't find on other islands; for example, a cannon can't be bought on the starting island, but a few other islands may have some for purchase. The same applies to foods, parts, weapons, and crew members. There are various professions that crew members may have. Sailors are needed to keep the ship clean; fighters have bonuses when attacking; cooks prepare raw foods into better quality foods; first mates will take over the ship if the captain dies, allowing you to keep playing if you die; and there are many more, all having unique abilities that will keep your ship running and the gold coming in. Each crew member also has special traits that affect their strengths and weaknesses; some traits are good (loyal, gunslinger, etc.) and others aren't as helpful (traitor, weak, etc.). Each crew member, including yourself, have an inventory that consists of an item slot (where you can add armor, extra ammo, self-destruct bombs, etc.), a weapon slot, where you can add one of the various types of melee weapons (cutlasses, short swords, spears, etc.) and another slot for an additional weapon, either an extra melee weapon or a ranged weapon (pistol, throwing knife, etc.). The crew is also going to be one of your main problems: you need to pay them. And some crew member will require a lot of pay to keep them happy. But by pillaging enough ships and islands, you should be able to keep up with the expense. Just keep in mind that this game is unforgiving: if the captain dies, the game is done, and you need to restart from the beginning (though a recent update at the time of this review added a mode where dying doesn't delete the save).I would rate this game an 7/10.+ Lots of fun to be had.+ The graphics complement the feeling of the game.+ Customizable ships and crew.- Some bugs, but this isn't really a bad thing, this being an Early Access game.- Could be very frustrating, depending on your attitude.

												I'm surprised this isn't Early Access, as it feels incomplete as-is and suffers a few game-breaking bugs. Skills and items, like Ship Repair and Chicken Nests, are obviously not finished/implemented into the game. There are also a few odd design choices that affect the game balance. Certain buffs are able to be applied to all crew members and stack, therefore making the game an odd one where it gets exponentially easier as it goes on. The first island should not feel more difficult than the final boss(es), imo.Gameplay wise, it's surprisingly similar to FTL. The ship combat and map, at least, have a lot of the same feel. You hire crew (which you have to keep healthy, happy, and fed), and you sail around plundering. There are three location types in the game - islands, towns, and other ships. Within those three, there are a few different flavours (cannibals or hags on islands, big ships or little ships, towns wih differing supplies). With the exception of a few bounty hunter fetch quests, and an option at the beginning to toggle a plague (which I didn't), there are no other events or surprises in the game. It starts to feel remarkably similar after a while, but more content should be on the way. The goal is to beat up progressively tougher opponants for progressively better loot, until you fight the final four bosses (conveniently spread WAY OUT across the huge map). Defeat them, and you get a cute song and the ability to continue playing. I'd suggest watching the cute song on Youtube and buying FTL.About 14 hours to complete Campaign mode on Beginner settings. I'd say around 3 of those hours (at least) was spent sailing - ie browsing the web in Steam's overlay, and closer to 8 hours if you don't count restarting after bugs/crashes (e.g. reloading caused my first mate to become captain while my captain was still alive, neither could progress).All that said, it's not a BAD game. I enjoyed it, but have no desire to play it any longer as is. When it's done, it'll probably be a pretty fun open world pirate sim. It definately has charm and personality. Certainly it's not worth the price right now, in Oct 2014. Check it out in a year and see where it's at.			"

												Yet another miscarriage provided by early access system is upon us.Do not believe the release date - the game is as raw as a game can possibly be and features lack of any balance, tons of bugs and deleted features.Examples of bugs:- Crew refusing to leave the enemy ship;- Enemy crew spawning on inaccessible parts of ship, making it impossible to kill them or escape the encounter;- Crew spawning on inaccessible parts of your own ship after each and every change of loading screens. They refuse to jump off as well;- Game despawning he island before despawning the actors when changing scenes from island to open sea. May be easily exploited by approaching the same island several times - after 3 or 4 times all island actors will be drowned;- Crew suddenly clipping through the hull and drowning for no obvious reason;- Crew attempting to ""clean"" their crewmates by kicking them off the ship;- PRESS SPACE TO INTERACT above all other windows, including the tutorial window;- When playing on low resolutions, long lists of the goods for sale will be offscreen;- Gunners loading the cannons with bombs endlessly. My personal record - 19 bombs loaded in a single cannon;- many others I did not mention.Balance issues:-Game difficulty wildly varies and even with 15+ crew with highly trained skills and above 50+ lvl I tend to avoid 5lvl+ encounters, since at least five of my crew tends to die during those encounters;- Rate of morale and hunger decrease varies wildly from version to version;- There is literally no new content in shops of lvl 5 and higher. Since you visited the lvl 4 shop - you saw everything that game has to offer you. Max level of shops are 8, by the way;- Crew tends to do everything, but not the things you need them to do. Fishermen will train, new pirates will just idle and cooks prioritise cleaning over cooking which quickly leads to crew starving cause fish was not caught, new pirates in crew dying in first encaunter since training areas occupied by slacking fishermen and once again crew starving to death while there are tons of uncooked food on board. And there is literally nothing you can do about it;- A single crew member can capture the 8lvl+ ship with proper equipment and training. At this point I just reverted back to captain-solo gameplay on a little boat, discarding all the crew.Deleted features:-Food no longer spawn on enemy ships for whatever reason;-Shackles are available for purchase in shop, promising the ability to capture prisoners during the boarding. Function was never implented, yet the item exists;- Social encounters, featuring the change of relationship between your crew.I could add much more to this list, but I am just done. I have no more willpower to force myself through this horrible and frustrating experience.This is not a proper release, it is just developers feeding off the release status hype and discounts related to it.Those slackers are so bold that they even show it as something great and to achieve - look at the news. It was just few days since release and they already published 5 hotfixes, while shouting on each corner that they are working hard for their players.Yeah, they released a first hotfix 40 minutes after release. Second hotfix several hours later. Yeah, for me it souns that they are hardly working, actually.It is just insulting to post unfini			"

												Most of these negetive reviews were from many months ago, but I feel like a lot of progress has been made in this game. I for one find it very fun. + I really enjoy how you get to build your own pirate ship out of parts you plunder or buy. It is very fun to do that and you can take pride in your ship, but also you can capture other ships you find and abandon your creation. + Another great aspect is how you get to hire your own crew. There are tons of randomly generated people on the islands to hire and it is basically like having a follower in an RPG game, but you control them at the same time. The exploration is pretty great and very enjoyable, through finding peaceful islands to ones swarming with hostile natives, or attacking enemy ships on the seas. You can find great loot almost always which is a good incentive to keep exploring, so you can upgrade your ship more.+  A cool aspect is food management, so you have to make sure you stop by some main islands every now and then to get food for your crew. It keeps things realistic and there are times where you can be in a pickle, having to get back fast for food in the beginning. Later on though you can be able to keep a large amount of food on ship so it isn't as much of a problem.+The areas are rated on a scale of 1-10 for difficulty, so you know where to explore and where to go if you want a challnge. A bigger challenge means bigger rewards, like getting better plunder from an enemy ship (or you could just capture it). However it would be difficult to defeat the enemy pirates and natives to get to that point anyway, so it is mostly just a good way to see how the difficulty progresses until you get to the final 4 (ranked 10).However, there are some negetives to this game, but nothing major stood out. - The controls and how to play weren't explained very well, but it isn't that hard to figure out and a quick google search every now and then in the beggining could fix my problems, like how to feed myself and my crew.- The combat is pretty weak. I personally don't mind it, but you just click on enemies and your people attack them. It can be a little boring combat wise from just having your crew do thigns on their own with no input by you, by you can control who they attack and if you want them to go somehwere during fights.- There isn't much depth to the game other than to explore and plunder to get a bigger and better ship and more crew. The journey to get there is fun, but once you get there and clear all the enemies, you probably have to start a new character to continue having a challenge.Overall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It is worth the $10 I'd say, but I would reccomend holding out for a sale or using one of those coupons. It is very fun to explore and battle and customizing your ship and crew is something I really enjoy.			"

												An open world pirate game with old school pixel graphics, yeah sounds great, right?But what you get is a buggy mess. The AI is terrible, the UI is unintuative and for some reason the graphics are blurry as hell, as if vaselene was smeared all over the screen. Theres a bloom slider, but it doesnt appear to fix the blur.I must ask WHO THE HELL PUTS BLOOM IN A PIXEL GAME!? Yeah, just what I needed. Light effect on my *pixels*. Really really bad idea. And its just one of many.This game is supposed to be complete, but it plays like an alpha. Theres no tutorials, enemies and guys spawn in places where they get stuck, bugs galore...I could go on.In short, awesome idea, beyond terrible execution.Dont waste your money.			"

												Very unfortunate to recommend against purchasing this game. The developer put a lot of love and work into it, and even recommends and facilitates people downloading the game via torrent first before buying. He put forth a rather ambitious development schedule and stuck to it. People who are saying he abandoned the game are not STRICTLY correct.That said, there are just too many game breaking bugs. The game was not left in a working state, and you will not be able to play it from start to finish without needing to load a save to avoid a bug. Most catastrophic from the state I currently see the game is pathfinding issues, specifically when landing on certain islands - this results in your characters either becoming stuck motionless on land until they are told to board the ship - at which point they dive into the ocean - or your captain becomes permanently immobilized on land. This is a very, very - very common bug, and you should expect it if you purchase this game.While I certainly support a developers decision to move on, especially when they were clear about their  games' development timeline, and love that the developer encouraged people to download the game and try it before buying it - I simply cannot under any circumstances advocate leaving a game that people payed for in such a broken state.Sadly, I do not recommend you purchase this game.

												The late game antics make this game hard to play. There is a memory leak that makes the fps drop like a rock. After 2 or 3 battles you must quit and then restart game. Once your ship reaches a certain size and then fighting another big ship just makes it unbearable. Only buy if you have lots of memory and I do mean alot as I have 8g ram plus a decent vid card.			"

												Aside from the bugs that many other negative reviews have mentioned, the gameplay is not that interesting.Here's how the game actually plays: You pick a location from the world map and then stare at the screen until the ship arrives there. If it's a town, you get off and sell your loot and maybe buy some food. All stores in all towns of the same rank sell the same items, so you'll stop looking at the store's inventories very quickly. On Islands, you will watch as your crew automatically fights some enemies, then open one treasure chest which always contains some gold and a few grindstones. You could also trigger one random location that either spawns some more enemies or gives you some useless items.Against pirate ships, you just wait for the enemy to board your ship (or board theirs if they don't do it), watch as your crew automatically fights them and then click the ""plunder"" button to get some gold and ship parts.That's the entire game.Random issues I have encountered:- Some UI functions simply do nothing if certain preconditions aren't fulfilled, so you never know if the game glitched out or you did something wrong.- Crew members simply refuse to leave the ship after a few minutes of playing, making it impossible to board enemy ships or islands until you save and reload the game.- The minute counter of the play timer doesn't revert at 60 minutes, so it showed my play time as 04:273:18 after four hours and 33 minutes of playing.- The script is full of typos, grammatical errors and horrible dialogue based on internet memes (""Do you even Arrr?"").- The game does not have permadeath, despite what the store page may tell you. Losses won't make you tear your hair out; they'll simply make you reload your last autosave.- Even if you turn autosaves off the game will still autosave when you exit.- To use items, you have to pretend that they're an accesory that you want to equip. The help screen doesn't explain this.- Also, healing items don't get stronger, so when your crew members each have 500+ HP you'll still be stuck with items that restore 5-30 HP. This will eventually make the game unplayable as nearly every enemy will explode on death and deal massive AoE damage to your characters which you cannot adequately heal.I admit that I still had some fun with Pixel Piracy and that it has some addictive qualities. However, the price is absolutely ridiculous considering that you can pick up games like Transistor or Trails in the Sky for a similar amount of money.			"

												Let's get the obvious shït outta the way first: I like Pixel Pirates! And yes, I know it's actually called Pixel PiraCY, but Pixel PiraTES just sounds way better.Anyway, moving on... I like this game. I really really do. HOWEVER, I cannot POSSIBLY recommend it to ANYONE, simply because of the atrociously poor ""productivity"" of the so-called ""developers"" of the game. They CLAIM that their complete radio silence and lack of updates for over eight months was due to ONE guy's failing health, and while I do wish him a speedy recovery, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE REST OF YOU LOT GET TO SIT AROUND AND TWIDDLE YOUR FÛCKING THUMBS!The game has an absolutely horrendous amount of bugs, glitches and exploits (one of the most jarring being the one with stacks of cannon balls being able to chain-explode through walls) as well as some lesser issues, such as the COMPLETELY arbitrary removal of being able to move the camera vertically (WHAT THE FÛCK?! Do you ""devs"" even know how hard it is to have proper sails on a decently sized frigate when you can't even have more than 2 floors?!)And that's not even mentioning the absolutely RETÄRDEDLY extremely poor balance issues! Here's a tip for all of you when starting a new game: PICK THE BLOODY SWORD. It's no fûckin' jokes 10x better than every single other non-epic weapon at the beginning of the game, and when it comes to a choice between an extremely retärdedly small amount of gold (20g, wow, that's ONE WHOLE BOTTLE OF RUM, YOU GUYS!!!) and an extra pirate who, frankly, is only useful for a novelty/gag achievement, it's pretty self-evident why you should choose the sword.Now, the graphics, sound and music are all nice and charming enough, so I won't criticize any of that. But the VOICES, however, are NOT charming AT ALL. This is a game where instead of having a few voice packs (let's say 10 per male/female) with several lines of dialogue each, you instead have maybe 200 voice packs in total, but they all contain one AND PRECISELY ONE line of dialogue! Sometimes, it's not even dialogue. Hell, I usually let my main pirate get the ""Arrr!"" voice, simply because it's the least grating one.Seriously. This voice thing wouldn't be so horrible if it wasn't for the fact that the one single line they have is ALL they EVER say, and BY GOD do they say it a fûcking LOT. Every time you give them an order, every time they ""say"" one of the idle remarks (which, admittedly, can be entertaining in a random joke sorta way) that appears as texts above them, and sometimes for no reason at all. So yeah. Voices? God it's horrible... even worse was the fact that the lady-types only got to say ""Loser!"" for a REALLY long while, which made playing as or even WITH a female pirate, especially SEVERAL such pirates, an absolutely NIGHTMARISH experience.Now, a cappella pirating voices aside, the game does have some fun factors too, like the extremely easy way to build your own ship (vertical camera restrictions notwithstanding) and how many different types of weapons there are to collect and use. Granted, you're not gonna see a handheld swivel-cannon type gun or a fist-claws type melee weapon, or even more outlandish things such as pots 'n' pans being wielded, but aside from that, the variety and actual differences between various weapons does lend the game some much-needed longevity.And the fact that you can have a good-sized crew rather than the measly maximum amount of 8 blokes in FTL, for example, means you don't need to feel entirely devastated and irredeemably crippled if 1-2 pirates die later on, since you can have at least 64 of the nasty, perpetually pooping fûckers at a time. So that's good.All in all, I like the game, but I'm DEFINITELY not blind to its imperfections. More likely, I've been made aware of the game's various blights way too well at this point. When/if the developers pull their heads outta their Horke-ärses, then MAYBE I'll change/remove this verdict and give them a more favourable judging, but until then, I would recommend everyone to STEER CLEAR of this game. 3.1/10			"

												I'd appreciate it if you checked out my blog, where I do reviews, giveaways, and more:https://gandhigaming.wordpress.com/Okay, I know some people will whine about my opinion, but let me state my responses to your issues...""You only have a couple of hours on the game.""How many negative reviews do you read? You'd be surprised by the number of people who have less hours on games and make extremely valid points.""The game is still in Early Access, Way to be helpful.""Well aware of that. I see a pretty bright future for the game.""Welcome to the world of Roguelikes/Roguelites.""Sorry, did you check to see what games are in my library?""Whine whine whine whine whine and whine.""Erm, was that really needed?Alright, here we go. Here goes my rant...Pixel Piracy is being published by Re-Logic, the devs behind one of my personal favorite Indie games: Terraria. Do they get cut slack because I love Terraria so much? Nope. The gameplay is a bit repetitive, even for a roguelike. I'm a big fan of roguelikes and enjoy playing them a lot. However, this one isn't that good. The exploration thing is alright, but it could've used more detail. Managing your ship is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥due to being overwhelmed with food, crewmembers, poop, ship upgrades, health, and more. It overwhelms me even more than FTL does. The graphics are average at the most, and there isn't much to it. YES, I understand this is pixelated graphics, but to the people out there who lack intelligence, I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THE PIXELATED VISUALS WERE USED. There.The audio, oh god, the dang audio. It is so ANNOYING listening to ""Me hardy har!"" every three seconds. Yes, I'm well aware of this thing called 'mute' and it ruins the game, too.The game, which I do understand, as it is in Early Access, has very little content. If it were the full game, I would rate this lower, but seeing that it isn't, I won't even bother with that. However, on the bright side of this, Pixel Piracy does have a pretty good future ahead, but it wouldn't be one of the greatest roguelikes of recent memory, like Dungeons of Dredmor and FTL. Also, for an Early Access game, I discovered little to no bugs. I've played many Early Access games, and this one was probably the best running of all of them. One other thing I saw is that it does have quite the replayability, and that it is one of those games that you dislike, but you can't help but play it anyway. So, in conclusion, I understand the game is in Early Access, but I've played better games that came out with less content, more bugs, etc etc. If you buy it and like it, then great. I'm happy for you that it was worth it. However, I would approach this game with caution. I'm afraid that I cannot recommend this game.Graphics- 5/10Gameplay- 4/10Story- 5/10Audio- 2/10Replayability- 9/10.:5.0/10:.+Bright future+Runs well for Early Access+Lots of replayability-Annoying audio-Repetitive gameplay-Limited exploration-Far too overwhelming-Poorly done 8-bit graphics___________________________________________________________________________________EDIT: New Review in Progress as of 7/31/14So far, based off of what I've played, it is much, much better now. The audio is much better, however the loops are very plain. The quality is much better, and the game runs great. However, the gameplay didn't change and the replayability lost it's spark. The exploration didn't change much but isn't as linear anymore. The overwhelming aspect of the game was organized much more now due to the new UI that is similar to FTL's. The devs are also very dedicated and seem to be very friendly compared to other devs out there. Kudos to them for releasing the game. And for the bright future part, looks like I was right. Most of the flaws I had with the game were fixed. Expect a positive review coming out soon.EDIT: 8/10/14Appears to be much more rushed than I thought. I encountered a few bugs and began disliking the game again. Forget what I said earlier about the positive review stuff. This one's staying negative.			"

												Ship 1: Everyone on the ship was starving, stabbed me to death because I forgot to feed them, but not before ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ everywhere.Ship 2: Fed the crew regularly, but nobody knows how to pick up♥♥♥♥♥♥  Crew gets angry about the poop-filled living conditions and stabs me to death.Ship 3: Turns out I have to find a specific book that teaches you the ancient art of cleaning poop off your boat.  It's hard to find a pirate island that has books for sale, and harder still to find one that has the poop cleaning book.  I spend all of my money on the book when I find it.  I, the captain, am the only one smart enough know how to read (i.e. had the skill points to do so) and taught myself the secrets of poo cleaning.  I don't have enough money to pay my pirates, let alone feed them.  While I'm cleaning poo off the boat, they stab me to death.Ship 4: Say to myself ""Screw it, I don't need a crew! I can just power up this single character!"".  That was a bad idea.  An island tribe of savage natives surround me and stab me to death.Great game.			"

												I really want to like this game because i loved terraria alot but, i just cant like it. I would go into detail of why but honestly people already said it. Bad AI hard to tell what crew to do glitchy every 5 seconds you hear Yar Har and cannons are so horrible and op by this point they should just take out cannons also the start can be really hard if you didnt get a pirate BUT for some reason with the right stuff ive seen 1 man crews take on tons of other pirates. The game should be in very early access. This game would be good if they fix this stuff. The devs do show that they care for this game and i hope they can make this a good game. The idea is amazing and the thought of it i love it and i have 400+ hours on terraria and i loved that game but they just made this game so bad.

												This game embodies everything that is wrong with the industry. It was released as full game, yet months later they are still adding things like making an end game, and fixing bugs that make it impossible to finish. The only tips and tricks to playing this stunted piece of garbage are ways to avoid game breaking bugs and make the game actually work. Very few of these tips come from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that took our money and told us to ♥♥♥♥ ourselves. Watch out for this dev in the future and avoid any trash that they release. Read the dev reports and you'll see how little work these♥♥♥♥♥♥suckers do on an unfinished game that we've already paid for.			"

												Pros:- It's kind of fun. I felt the need to finish the game, which is more than what I can say for most games. Took 12 hours to beat going at a slow pace.- You can build your own ship.- You get to watch your crew kick poop off your ship for half the game.Cons:- Horrendously loud intro. Turn your volume down when you start the game.- Repetitive voice audio. These pirates talk a lot and they sound prepubescent.- Redundant game play. If you've seen one ship/island battle, you've seen them all. Towns look mostly the same with some variation of available shops. You go back and forth between ship/island battles and town where you unload your booty and restock on inventory.-  Increasing frame rate lag  as you progress. By the time I beat the game, I was down to about 5 fps. It was especially bad when it was raining.- Tedious menus. Not getting into this one since it's difficult to describe. It was probably the worst part of the game.- Game difficulty. Getting dodge to 200% and splitting your remaining points into vitality and strength make the game  trivial. None of my crew were in danger when fighting the final legendary pirate. He ate bullets and flopped over before reaching anyone.- Unimpressive food, skill, pet, and morale system:The crew gets hungry and unhappy over time. Just leave food out on your ship and your crew will eat when they feel like it. For some reason, you can't place food on the ship unless you're docked at a town, so your crew gets to starve for a bit when you take over an enemy ship. There are a dozen different foods to purchase, but I found myself buying nothing but citrus and fruit due to issues with scurvy. Scurvy reduces your crew's attributes, which are vital to winning battles, until you consume food that contains vitamins. I felt no compelling reason to buy any other type of food. Whenever the crew were unhappy, I either gave them rum or paid them an inconsequential amount of money. Essentially just an extra button to press every 5 minutes. Skills can be acquired through books you find in item stores or pillaging ships/islands. There is a limit to how many skills you can have, so you have to choose which to keep for each crewmember. The only non-combat skills necessary to play the game are cleaning, ship repair, and swimming.You can catch pets using an animal cage. I captured about 20 animals and all they did was add to the amount of poop my crew had to clean. In the rare event that enemies boarded my ship, the animals would assist in defending, but that was it. You can mount an animal on yourself for an added benefit such as increased movement speed, but I didn't bother since I found myself accidently picking up a crewmember instead of the pet every time.Conclusion:It's an okay game to snag on sale if you enjoy rogue-like games, but I do not recommend it at full price.

												This could have been a good game. I could have enjoyed it. Scratch that; I did enjoy it. To a limited extent. In theory this is one of the better games I have played of its kind. Simple, somewhat repetitive and grindy, and full of numbers, just the way I like it. In practice however... It's an unpolished, crude, and messy game.Controls are weird and take a bit to get used to. I eventually got the hang of it and managed to play the game rather fluidly, but I can see that not being the case for a lot of people. There's a limit to how much you learn from the tutorials, and I would never judge anyone for failing to figure out the game and giving up. (Moreso than in other games, that is).The menus are tedious and  break, items are grouped together weirdly and I've had cases where I've had to spend several minutes burning skill books on pirates to access completely unrelated items as there is no scrolling feature in the gven subset of items. Weaponry is weirdly nondescriptive, and I have refrained from buying a lot of weapons as the listed Damage Per Second for weapons in the store is greatly misleading.The game also suffers from, as most other reviewers mention, late game performance issues. Once my ship's size reached some fifteen by thirty blocks in size, the game froze for well over half a second every time I placed a tile. Adding twentyfive crewmembers made the entire game experience run in a rather nasty way. I've had several crashes, and loading screens become waiting games at the point in the game I reached. In short, progress is punished by performance loss.Had this game been shown a bit more love and attention, It could have become one of my more liked games. I like it as is, but it's in the way you love a dog who tries its best and is very soft, but poops on the carpet, rolls in any available mud, and conveniently has to go outside whenever you are asleep. It's debatable whether or not it's worth the effort in the end.In short; it's a sweet little game that could have been much more enjoyable were it not seemingly a rushed and unpolished project, coding and content wise. Do not under any circumstances buy it at full price, though if you have the game sense necessary to figure out the control system and enjoy casual looting and leveling up it might be worth its price when it gets a solid cut off during some sort of sale.

												PP is a terrible game. Weak, unfinished, & un-optimized; a boorishly pixelated game runs at over 70 degrees C with v-sync; hotter than GTA V. Each flat, uninteresting ""island"" is just a line broken up by crap loading screens. Hunger and morale systems are tedious, boring, and in need of a rework. Ship items like cannons require such a high investment and training that fun cannot be had. Pirates are voiced by what seems to be an 8 year old that makes me want to punch a baby. The new dev's involvement is unimpressive as the abysmal core game mechanics remain unchanged. What you have is a disappointing attempt at what could have been an exciting pirate concept. For shame.			"

												For an unfinished game, Pixel Piracy is promising. They take some weird shortcuts with sprite animation, the sprites themselves are a little ugly, combat and exploration is a little bland and monotonous right now, and hopefully they'll fix the buggy, clunky menus soon, but when they finish it, this'll be a great game!

												Let me preface this with I do not in any way shape or form, recommend this game to anyone at all.This game is riddled with bugs most severe of which is a memory leak from just playing for 4 hours in one session.I am a Game Design student and I decided to play this game which has been in my library for my Game Testing course.Here's the list of all 31 bugs that I foundI snipped a few just to add a couple I really like that were cut offI seem to have hit the character limit on a reviewBugs:1.

Posted: August 6, 2014
												I stopped playing this game when my first mate started running in circles with a turd in his hand and a turtle on his head.  He seemed confused as to whether to join his crew in the tavern or practice swords in the cabin.  Or throw the turd away.  Or set the turtle down.  Yes, this is a problem, and I doubt the excuse of the crew having freewill really addresses this.  But more on this later.Initally it was a fun experience, though the lack of intuitive tutorials made it a little rockier to start than most games.  The overall look of the game, the sound of the music, and the grunts of the pirates were all quite welcoming as well.  As I conquered each island or pirate ship, things got progressively harder in a maneagable sense.  I hired my first mate and named him ""Vance the Lance"" in honor of the hulking spear he carried.  I got a kick out of his former job as a fantastic male model.  Qualities I definitely need in my pirate crew.Whatever the case, Vance and I soon had a larger crew to manage, and that's about when the problems started to happen.  Arnold the Brick (because he is dumb as a bag of bricks apparently), had decided he was no longer going to cook the fish he had become so good at catching.  I decided to teach another crew member how to cook expecting this to solve the problem.  Ironically, this crew member nearly died to starvation because he too refused to cook, despite having both the skill and knife to do so.  Meanwhile, Arnold kept providing me fish which I as the player kept placing in hopes of SOMEONE actually cooking it.  The solution to this odd problem was for me to dock at the nearest town and frantically buy fruit for my famished crew.Now, some would say the real problem here was that the morale must have been poor.  I wish I could say this was the problem, but I had my crew loaded with Rum and Gold, thus spirits were high.  Nope, this was just an example of poor AI.  Which brings us back to my poor first mate.Poor Vance.  I wanted to help him, but he was so absorbed in his turd/turtle ritual...it was bad.  And that wasn't the only thing I saw.  Many of my pirates couldn't handle things like ""crawl over up that ladder"" or ""walk over there.""   I was excited to get cannons, but soon I realized that the AI was very prone to getting choked on that as well.  My cannoneers would frequently take too long to load cannons.  Some would be more inclined to playing cards than loading the cannon.  Your game of solitaire needs to wait guys!  Cannons PLEASSSE!   Then the fights would happen.  I liked the chaos of it all well enough, but sometimes stupid junk would happen.  Like swimming.  My captain has the swimming skill, but he never seems inclined to using it when he innevitably gets knocked into the water.  The knockback can get kinda crazy in the fights too.  Thank goodness there is a reloading button..but sheesh.Then there was sailing.  I get the use for it, but I kinda wish there were more random occurences that would just happen to break things up.  Something like, mermaid attacks...or giant white whale attacks...or seagull raiding parties...  I don't know...Just something!  Break up the humdrum of pooping pirates derping back and forth on a fictional ship.  The morale/hunger is the last thing that I think needs a bit more tweaking.  Gold is used to pay your crew, which instantly puts them at full morale.  Gold is also used to feed the crew when your sailing.  You can raise their morale and their hunger (how well fed they are) at taverns.  The hunger stat raises reaaaaally slowly, so unless you want to wait all day, your better off buying food for them at the ship (which costs even more gold), or fishing it (which means dealing with finicky AI). They also have to have gold to spend (apparently) to make use of the tavern...but with no way to track what gold each pirate has, it's kinda difficult to keep track of (i.e. When did I last pay them?).  It also bothers me immensly that my captain never seems to eat when he is at the tavern.  It seems he is damned to eating food on a ship instead of with his crew.Ah well...I bought the game on sale at least, so I'm not OVERLY disgruntled.Don't get me wrong.  I've enjoyed my time with this game so far...but I think I will stop and wait for them to address some of these issues (hopefully) before I continue my foray into Pixel Piracy.I'll gladly update this review in the future if some changes actually occur!  Until then, Vance and his turd problem shall remain.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT:Thought I might throw some more positives into what I thought about the game:-Combat is frantic, but I enjoyed the chaos of it.  It isn't so noticeable with small crews, but with larger crews it can be a chaotic blast.-Creating your own boat is an interesting concept as you progress through the game.  You always have the option of simply taking the enemy boat, but I enjoy plundering them and slowing adding various parts to my own ship.  I'd love to see more cosmetic damage to the ship as you take bombardment shots eventually!-Charming: I know I said it once before, but I really do like the look and sound of it all.  I'm not a fan of  all the shanties/tavern songs, but I do think that it is a nice touch.  Visually, I enjoy the pixelated nature of the characters and the locales they inhabit.-Looting makes me feel good, and there is always the chance you'll find something very nice (like a diamond which sells for quite a bit)  I'd love to see more of this expanded, but it seems good enough for now.  I'd love to see plundering expanded (i.e. attacking TRADE ships vs pirate, or attacking cities, or stealing the food stores off a ship)And lastly, the management is a positive when the game works as I think was intended.  When the AI actually does what you want, and you get into the groove of managing moral vs gold, it is fairly enjoyable.  I would tweak it in different ways personally, but I think the framework in place works well enough. (i.e. I'd make taverns more effective at curing hunger, I'd make paying the crew worth less morale to place more emphasis on buying/finding rum or visiting taverns)------ 1.7 UpdateThe Good news:-My first mate finally got his life straight and decided to join us on the shore.-For about 30-40 minutes, the AI felt decent/better and I was enjoying myself well enough.-Pets are way easier to catch now!  No more grinding!-My captain actually finally decided that bar food is OK.  It may have only been a nibble, but that is progress in my book.  I sincerely hope they address taverns and make them a little more useful in regards to hunger.(and on that note, I really wish I knew how much gold each crewmember had to spend!)The Bad news:-After about 40 minutes, my new pet chicken (called ROBOCHICKEN) decided he is part of the crew now.  I caught him practicing with swords and playing cards in a corner.  I didn't notice if he was also eating, but I definitely caught the bugger taking a dump next to the larder.  I've got my eye on you chicken!-The AI has gone back to being a reluctant mess.  Shovelback Ray (my chief shovel carrier/treasure hunter) refuses to leave the boat for anything.-The moral system went haywire.  I paid my crew as usual, but seconds later everyone went from super happy to ""KILL THE CAPTAIN"" rage.  I dunno...maybe the chicken is promoting a mutiny among my men?-Eh, Better luck in 1.08 I hope!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

												An interesting game with a great all around premise, but has more potential than realization.  Unfortunately, the AI is so shi!!e that what should have been a fantastic indie game falls short on all counts. There is no real tactics besides mob rushing, and there is no way to dictate tasks for NPCs besides going to a certain location and maybe select specific enemies to attack. No being able to tell a gunner to man the turret, just put him nearby and hope he gets the hint. No way to force the fisherman to stay on task when he goes off to practice his sword skills (with a fishing pole?)This game should still be in beta. It was released too early and the result is nothing short of pathetic. 4/10The greatest satisfaction I got out of this game was getting it off the wishlist of my friends.			"

Early Access Review
								At this time (very early alpha) even though the game is barren and unbalanced (which is to be expected) it has a good core, and i have no doubt this game will grow to become great.That said, in Pixel Piracy you are a captain with a small pouch of gold coins to hire a crew/purchase supplies and some materials to build your first ship.Sail across the ocean and pillage and plunder to your hearts desire, but with the world filled with powerful opponents and dangerous creatures this will be no easy task, and let us not forget your crew, they need to be fed and paid or they will either die or turn on you.Do you have what it takes to survive, is the pirates life for ye?

												How could this game have been considered ready to publish?This product is a borderline scam. There are so many things wrong with it I don't even know where to start. Was it ever even tested? I've played for maybe 4-5 hours and have already found two gamebreaking bugs, and countless minor ones.The game in general is just completely devoid of polish. Why are there social media links on the main menu? Is this a flash game? The timer would have me believe that I have sunk 2 hours and 159 minutes into my current playthrough. Why did the developers feel obliged to invent a new system of time measurement? Why is there text floating in the air on islands? The AI is completely nonexistent. Crewmembers will run right through enemies instead of attacking them and will never attack neutral characters unless I do so with my captain. Pathing is horrible. Being given a shorter path and a longer one, crewmembers inevitably take the latter. They also sometimes get stuck on single blocks, which they should be able to climb.Sometimes they refuse to eat and simply die of hunger. Their salary is random and the game lies as to how much pay the crew wants.There are numerous design problems that should have been fixed before the game was released. Blocks destroyed by cannons turn into unwalkable floor, which means characters may end up stuck. Caught fish cannot be eaten until you dock and actually place them on your ship. The game is very micro-intensive. I had to switch manually between a fishing-rod and sword for one of my pirates every time I was in combat.Do not make the same mistake I did. Treat this game as the beta that it is. If you are looking for a finished game to enjoy, look elsewhere.			"

 Overview  Pixel Piracy is a 2D side-scrolling adventure game developed by Quadro Delta. The game puts you in the shoes of a pirate captain with a mission to defeat four legendary pirates. During your quest you'll have to recruit crew members, train them, arm them, fight rival pirates and imperial ships, loot said ships or capture them if you so desire. If that sounds like fun to you, then let the disappointment commence! Pixel Piracy is a disaster. The game starts you off on an island, where you'll give your captain a name, change a few minor looks (face, hair, clothing color) and answer a few questions that will change a few parameters of your gameplay (more ship encounters, less encounters, more starting gold, higher loot rates...etc) and you're off and running. In the beginning you'll be tasked to hire crew members, design your ship and set sail for treasure, knowledge, death and bordem.The map is broken up into nodes (squares). Each node holds either an island (hostile or friendly), towns of various sizes, or ship encounters (pirate or imperial vessels). A number is given before sailing to the next node that indicates the difficulty of what you'll encounter and to help you gauge what you can handle. The combat itself is nothing to write home about; it consists of boarding a ship and letting your crew kill the opposition. Typically, it's over in a matter of seconds and requires only a few mouse clicks per battle. As you fight higher difficulty crews, you'll be able to acquire ship cannons, new weapons, and passive bonuses to help your crew survive. You'll also obtain hull components that you can use to customize your ship. Along with better equipment, you must sustain your crew's morale, and hunger levels. Morale is effected by the cleanliness of your ship and by paying your crew their salary in gold, which is typically found from plundering ships and raiding islands. The game does have permadeath for both crew and captain. You can die from drowning, being killed in action, a wild animal, starvation or mutiny (low morale). That's about all there is to the game. It seems like a lot, but it's not very in depth. What Pixel Piracy does right, it does a dozen more things wrong. Let's break the down game on what it did right and what it did wrong.I felt the ship building was done well. It was easy to mix and match pieces, shuffle them around and make the ship however I wanted. Where it went wrong was with mast/sail building, which is finicky at best and broken at worst. I was forced to capture a ship with a flag/sail just to get the achievement since it wouldn't let me build my own (even with all the components).Equiping and changing around your pirate's gear and bonuses is was well done. It was easy to move around them, switch out weapons and see what would serve me better than what I already had; a DPS counter was on all the weapons, which made it easy to pick through. However, the combat was dull and forgettable. Sure, I could and did deck out everyone in great gear, but watching them fight was boring; it was a cluster of pixelated people flying left and right, shooting here and stabbing there. There was nothing to do mid fight aside from tossing a few bandages for health. You were left as a spectator in your own game. Several aspects: two minor ones and one major, were the most off-putting during my experiences playing. The minor aspects included the voices/sound effects and the game's weird fascination with defecation and applying that to every aspect of the game: there were achievements for your crew soiling your ship, for seagulls soiling your ship, skills to lessen said soiling of said ship and so on and so forth. It was rather absurd. With that being said, the sound effects. The voices were agitating. Between the bad singing in the taverns, my crew constantly saying random, nonsensical things and my captain sounding like she was being sexually gratified every time she said ""Yes!"" I couldn't tell what I hated more.The major issue was path finding. When sailing to an island, your crew will use a grapple hook to climb down towards the island. On occasion and alarmingly frequently, they would fail to grapple either to the island or back to the ship. When that happens, the crew member would walk right into the water and drown, or jump into the air and then fall back down, also in the water and also drowning. You'd lose your crew member (remember, permadeath?) and all their gear, skills and work you put into them. To remedy this, you would have to re-load, or continue on without him/her and suffer the loss. This has been an issue for some time and the developers were made aware of it, but the problem was never resolved. Pros   Ship building - I actually liked this aspect of the game. Equipment - There's a decent amount of weaponry and active/passive bonuses to apply to your crew. It's easy to work with and upgrade your crew. Cons    AI - Path finding issues, glitches, failure to follow instructions and they never stop talking... Path finding - As mentioned before, your pirate will, often, fail to grapple the ship from an island fall in the water and drown. It happens. A lot. In a few hour span I lost about a dozen pirates to this and had to restart on many occasions. Voice acting - It's bad. Not only is it atrociously bad, it's dreadfully annoying too. After an hour or so I had to turn off the voice completely. Combat - It's dull. Click to have your pirates attack, wait a few seconds, collect loot. rinse, repeat indefinitely. Overall, Pixel Piracy sounds good on paper, but it fails in execution. It's heavy-handed UI and AI are both cumbersome and obnoxious. It suffers from game breaking glitches that will force you to re-load the game on several occasions, or start over completely. That is, unless you don't just quit first. Pixel Piracy needs work and a lot of it at that. I tried to find a silver lining in this game. I really did; there just is no justification for something that feels so unfinished. If you're looking for a pirate themed game, look somewhere else. Pixel Piracy isn't worth the price tag or your time.			"

Posted: November 19, 2014
												[Updated 5/19/2014] So after a long LONG time since I've played this game, I went back and tried the game out and I must say, they really improved quite a bit of things. Now I will leave the old review bits here because I want people to see how the game has changed from the last time I played which was roughly half a year ago. I will make some comparisons though just to show what changed.So the game. The one thing that they improved that makes this game more fun is they improved the economy. For those who don't know, in the previous versions, getting spending gold was work in itself but now enemy ships and pirates and whatever else you can think of just drops gold like they're money making machines which is fine since now you can just get stuff and build your pirate army! Arrrgh maties!Another issue that this game had was that the enemy doesn't respawn but now they do! Though it takes a while. With this fix, another issue has appeared. Since the enemy do respawn and you're going to out-level them in a few minutes with the new economy, there's a need for enemies to scale. Sure you can just keep going outwards and outwards for the higher level enemies but I just spent about an hour into the game and I'm already butting heads with Lv7 enemies with a giant ship and a crew of 10+ mates and then the entire area is void of enemies waiting to respawn. Cleared out the Lv5-6 and since the Lv7s are dead, it's time for Lv8s. Too fast paced.The sea now feels more... lively. Each time you set out, there may be a weather change like rain, hurricane, fog, etc. Which brings up another problem, the music. I'm in a hurricane and yet the music in the background is soothing and it's like telling my crew to go to sleep and all the problems will go away. Then another problem with the sounds is that they're broken. What I mean is that during in a fight, I can have my camera on the scene yet all I would hear is the music and seagulls with the occasional sword clash and/or scream from dying enemies. I mean this is more of a bug than anything but I just felt like putting it out there since I was talking about background music anyways.There are a lot more variety of things for your ship to pretty it up. Speaking of ships, back then when you capture a ship, you get the ship exactly the way it's look. What I mean is that when you're in a battle, the enemy ship is orientated in such a way that it is pointing at you and when you capture it, it stays that way. Now when you do capture a new ship, the ship is re-orientated to point the proper way. Nice attention to detail.I get the feel this is less of a review and more about a changelog or something. The game is certainly more satisfying to play but it still is lacking a certain niche. Don't get me wrong, it is fun to make a ship with a ton of cannons and just shoot the heck out of my opponent not giving a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about money anymore but that just tends to get boring especially since I have to go out and look for fights to deal with and then head back to buy more ammo in case I run out. Now... Is this game worth the price... Still no. It's getting close though, it really is but still not feeling it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Old Review] I want to recommend this game. I really do but at the game's current stage, I cannot. When I first checked that it was created by creators of Terraria, I thought to myself, ""Hey, here's a nice lay-back game I could play. The creators should know how to make worlds in this game.""Then I get smacked in the face like just 3-4 hours into the game. The world does seem large and vast with variety in it, AT FIRST. Then after a while, the flaws of the game becomes so glaringly sharp that it just feels dull.I haven't been to Lv6 or above island/pirate ships yet but except for your possible starting weapon, the Falcon Blade, there are absolutely no unique weapons. Even the Falcon Blade falls short after getting a crew of 5 combat-able pirates. After that it's just a plain Zerg rush onto enemy ships or hostile islands and wiping the populace from the face of the Earth. I guess if you want just a generic army with nothing truly special about them, this works. I wanted to feel special though.Enemy pirate ships are not RNG encounters. They are actually listed on the map for you to go to beat up. After that, they're gone completely. So while you're traveling from point A to point B, you're sitting there looking at the screen for 1-2 minutes while playing games on your iPhone because literally nothing ever happens. In the beginning of the game, there were a rare instance of a Fishman jumping onto my ship and I had to kill it off but that never happens once you upgrade your ship to a larger one. All you will ever see on screen are your pirates pooping all over the deck, fishing for food, eating, text bubbles going so fast that you can barely read what they say and it's just plain BORING.The chests in this game are absolutely disappointing. Except for the buried chests, the chests you find on islands and enemy ships yield about 3-10g depending on how many pirates have the 'More Gold in Chests' skill and their levels. Item loots are about 90% of the time grindstones to increase your melee weapons' damage. There are grindstones for ranged but you can only buy those. I would expect an enemy galleon to have way more than 10g and 2 grindstones in their stupid treasury box.Game looks nice. Feels nice. Doesn't follow through. $10? Well I paid $7.50 since I had a coupon but... I've had $1 iPhone games that I've played for 20 hours so... You doods should wait.			"

												Development was going good, promises were made, and the game looked great. Then the developers seemed to have fallen off the face of the Earth. They seem to have a sudden burst of activity and then just leave. Moving on, the game gets old extremely fast and there's bugs everywhere. I also really hate the graphics. The old graphics were perfectly fine and then the developers came out of nowhere and threw this ugly filter on it. Might be able to turn it off but I haven't found an option for it yet.Don't get me wrong, it's a decent idea but the devs completely left us hanging. I would have loved this game if the devs would update it.			"

PROS Fun game, for a while Interesting ship-building and exploration system.NEUTRAL Graphics settings are a bit odd.CONS Very, very buggy. Progressively becomes laggier and laggier the longer you play. Repetetive, no real replay value. Combat is lame. Inventory management is horrible. Devs seem to have abandoned the game.In short, don't buy this unless it's on sale, and even then you might want to find something better to spend your dinero on.			"

												This game was actually really fun when I first bought it but they put out a few patches that made the game far worse and full of gamebreaking bugs.  I've waiting at least a year before writing this review assuming they would eventually fix it or roll it back to the old version... they did not.  I can not recommend buying this game in its current form.  If the developer ever fixes any of the major gamebreaking bugs I will revisit this review.			"

												Lots of potential here, unfortunately spread a little thin and made near enough unplayable by bugs. I dare say Pixel Piracy in its current state is more broken than it was when I first played it a few months ago, before the devs claimed it was ""complete.""  Members of your crew will frequently decide not to follow your orders - this is not a result of the game's morale mechanic, which makes low morale crew members refuse orders, this happens with happy as can be, 100% morale pirates. Sometimes, they'll stand in one place and not listen to anything you say, or even move of their own accord(in order to say, get food, clean or repair the ship). Other times they'll quite happily go wherever you tell them on the ship, but can't grapple onto other ships or an island. In a game where most of the gameplay revolves around commanding your crew, you can see why this is extremely frustrating.So the game has bugs, those can be fixed, and I trust the devs not to ignore such a glaring issue. What about gameplay? It's... Okay. When I played the early access, I thought it was pretty fun, but it didn't take long before it started to get boring and samey. Now the finished game is out and I find myself thinking more or less the same things. The combat consists of rounding up all your dudes and sending them in the direction of the enemy who is rounding up all his dudes and sending them at you, you meet in the middle and hopefully win. The outcome of a fight is decided by stats and equipment, which is true of a lot of games, but unfortunately there's not a lot of depth or variety to those aspects either. If you win a fight you get some gold, some experience and some (usually uninteresting) loot. The biggest curveball the combat has to offer is the knockback mechanic, which is far too big a curveball. Even on ""easy"" knockback settings(knockback reduced to 40%) my dudes were getting knocked back several feet. You don't get enough control over your pirates to do much to avoid it, it doesn't really add anything to the game aside from occasionally instantly killing someone if they get knocked into the ocean. Most of your game overs will be a result of this happening to your captain, and to top it off, if you kill an enemy this way, you can't get the loot they drop. The game's morale system feels a little underdeveloped as well. It's pretty much what it sounds like: if you don't keep your dudes happy they're less willing to fight and if morale gets too low they'll turn on you. There are two main ways to restore your crew's morale: Pay their salary(costs money, obviously) or let them spend some time at a tavern, which is free but taverns are few and far between and you never know if a town has one until you actually dock there. This discourages exploration and makes it advantageous to stay as close to known taverns as you can.Most of your gold will pay for food and your crew's salaries, the rest you will save up to hire more crewmemebers until you have a big enough crew to take on tougher battles to get more gold, which you'll need because your crew is eating more food. Lather, rinse, repeat. There's variety in the enemies, but only superficially. Mostly, you'll be fighting pirates. Sometimes, you'll be fighting vikings, skeletons, hobos or chinese. Yeah, there's an entire enemy class just called ""Chinese."" You get slightly different loot from them, but aside from that the only differences are visual, which is hard to pick out given the low detail of the sprites and the visually chaotic combat. It still boils down to throwing all your dudes at them and hoping you come out on top. So the combat is alright at best, but that's not even what you'll be spending most of your time doing. Most of the time, you'll be sailing between locations. While sailing, you don't really do anything. You watch your crew eat and poop, and listen to them chatter. Occasionally, they'll sing a sea shanty, which isn't very good but if anything it's a welcome release from repeating the same quips ad nauseam. Nothing happens, your ship just sails along a flat, lifeless ocean for a while until you reach your destination. This gets more annoying later in the game as you start travelling further distances at a time. You can sail faster by gluing bits to your boat or with character skills, but spending valuable cash and skill points to reduce tedium doesn't strike me as good game design. You have to go through this every time you move to a different location, which includes heading back to town to buy food and let your crew rest, so half the time you don't even have anything interesting to look forward to. The excessive waiting is what really kills the fun of this game.All these flaws are a shame because underneath it all there's a fun game that really wants to show itself. Though it doesn't require a lot of thought, managing your crew and gradually building it up to take on tougher fights is satisfying. The music, voices and graphics are all nice, but lack in quantity and get repetitive. It feels like a beta version: a solid foundation, lacking balance and content and with a bunch of bugs that need cleaning up. If the devs continue working on it I still think something good can come out of Pixel Piracy. Unless that happens, don't bother with this.""JOLLY ROGER! JOLLY ROGER! JOLLY ROGER! JOLLY ROGER!

												Man, I really love this game. I really do. I have a lot of fantastic memories of building my massive pirate ships outfitted with tens of cannons, building an army of pirates (who all suffered from scruvy since I didn't know how to cure it) to absolutely destroy any enemy who I crossed paths with. However with the way the devs have dealt with this game breaking bug which prevents you from progressing in the game, I have decided to give the game a negative review in an attempt to persuade the devs to fix this problem preventing us from playing this fantastic game.

												Simple review for youAt it's current state that game is full of game breaking bugs. For example, your captian refuses to eat or you cannot edit your ship while docked. Although the game is great in concept and design, more work needs to be done to flesh it out and crush those bugs. Pros+ Intereasting and addictive concept + Simple design and controlsCons- Horrific and annoying bugs- Ai managment is abhorrent ( npcs will eat and focus on skill building when captain or boat is under attack)- Lack of information regarding the actually pregame settings you pick- Lack of content (As is, this game is more of a proof of concept rather than a complete game)In conclusion, I say this is a game to watch rather than buy outright. It is up to the devs to fix the most notable issues (being the dissapointing amount of bugs) and add more content to the game. Afterwards, if fixed I would recommend this  without a doubt.			"

tl;dr: Poop simulator with pirates yelling nonstopFun, simple 2d pirate game where you can name, level up and equip your crew as you wish. Easy to get in, but sadly the game seems incomplete.  The combat is overly simple How effective stats are is unclear Damage of weapons and cannons is vague at best Once you get a decent crew, it's all about charging into an enemy crew with increasingly high numbers and hoping you come on top.Fun for a few hours at best. I heard they were making a new one, hopefully controls will have more than one-click for all actions and numbers in the game will be more transparent.			"

Posted: July 23, 2016
												When I first saw this game I knew it was going to be a blast. Who doesn't want to pillage islands and destroy enemy pirate ships?Starting the game I took the time to design a pirate and give him a name. Then I selected a back story for him. I was on the right track! After about 15 minutes of playing I realized that my character I took the time to customize had died, and was replaced with a new captain! I thought this was odd, but decided to keep playing. Maybe it wouldn't affect the story. I mean, I can get over the trivial loss of my new favorite character and learn to love his replacement that I hired from a tavern.After about 4 hours of pillaging and ship fights I decided it was time to get to business and get more involved in the story. I needed to find my objectives. It was then that I realized that there is no story. No quests. Not objectives, aside from achievements. It really sucked, but I decided that I bought the game and have already wasted about 4 hours playing. Why not finish?I began recruiting crew members. Trained them. Leveled them. I made my way to the first legendary boss. Sure, things got rough, but I managed to pull through. The ship battles got even better when I figured out how to work cannons. I could take down an enemy ship before they even had a chance to board! I was untouchable! When I got to the first legendary pirate boss I was excited. Then I realized that this legendary pirate didn't have a single cannon on his ship. None. I was able to destroy him and his ship before the boarding phase of combat. It was a total letdown. Not only that, he and his crew had fewer hit points than other pirates I'd already faced. Not much of a legendary pirate if you ask me.It didn't take long before I stopped visiting islands and just headed straight for the other legendary pirates. It was a wholly underwhelming experience.The laundry list of bugs and design flaws were also more than a minor pain.• Poop gets stuck inside the ship. It manages to get stuck BETWEEN the blocks of hull, making it impossible for your crew to clean. You also can't remove blocks around poop, so it has to stay there until you take the time to clear out your entire ship build and start from scratch. But then it just happens again 15 minutes later.• If you are sailing to an area and cross paths with an enemy pirate you can choose to fight or flee. If you flee successfully you don't continue your trip, but instead have to open the map again and select your destination. This makes travelling long distances very annoying.• If a crew member gets stuck while trying to perform a task (like picking up poop or loading a cannon) no other crew member will attempt the same task. Now you're down a crew member until you notice and tell him to move somewhere.• Trying to make a pirate flee is near impossible. If you tell him to run away and he is hit, he will target whatever hit him and attack. This results in you trying to get him to run by constantly clicking, but he just ends up dying.• The controls are inconsistent. In some screens you have to use the keyboard to pan the view. In others only the mouse can be used. You also can't use the mouse wheel to scroll through lists of items, and clicking an item will take you back to the top of the list.• Crew frequently have trouble targeting enemies. You can send your entire crew down to attack some enemies, but once they kill the enemy half of them will stand around doing nothing until you give them a new target.• Pirates must be part of your ""Ship Crew"" group to get them to clean or repair the ship, even if they're idle with nothing else to do.• Vertical panning of the camera has been disabled. You can build your ship very tall, but you won't be able to scroll up to see it.• Some sounds come from the wrong stereo channel. For example, a crew member can be training on the ship on the left side of the screen, but the sound effects will come from the right speaker. If you scroll far enough to the right it will eventually move to the left speaker.• Massive frame drops when you build a large ship. There were times I went from 200 FPS down to about 3 while trying to build my ship.• Pets don't seem to have any real benefit, and because the captain is the only one that can carry them they are too cumbersome to be used in a fight.• The crew needs to poop CONSTANTLY. They always end up piled up around the toilets and food. The ship will be a ghost town except in the bathroom, where you will find 30 guys in about 5 blocks of space. They will even stop fighting to run to the bathroom if they're on the ship.• If there's a captain's chair he won't do anything but sit in it. Well, except poop and eat.• Scurvy sets in after about 10 minutes. The crew will eat 20 pieces of fruit before they even TOUCH another piece of food. Food sources that don't have vitamins will sit on the deck for ages being unused.• The ""Boarders"" group doesn't seem to do anything. I have to manually command them to board an enemy ship once it is in range. And after I send them across, if I don't stop my ""Gunners"" group they'll blow up my Boarders while they're on the enemy ship.I really wanted to like this game, and I looked forward to it from the time I saw early screenshots and videos. Being that it was released over a year ago and it still has these major flaws is very disappointing. This game has real potential.			"

												I love the concept and I want to love this game so much. But the gameplay is just not intuitive enough. If I click on my pirates, it dosn't select them. If I ask my pirate to move towards or away from something, they'll decide on thier own what to do & get themselves killed.  When crap pilles up, I should be able to click on a crewmember, point to the pile & select a clean up action.  I love the art, style, & idea. But the gameplay needs a major overhaul before they do a full release.I hope to change my recommendation when the gameplay improves.***********************************************************************************Gameplay is still  just not intuitive.Gave it another hour with the Full Release updates.My captian & crew still wont follow instructions very well, sometimes not at all.So unless you like your character doing things without you asking or not doing the tasks you asked them, I wouldn't recommend this game.

												First of all, game has potential. But for now, it's an incomplete buggy mess. Every island, encounter, feels the same.-Character perks are buggy, your cooks don't cook, fishermen don't fish, instead they all agree upon ""pooping"" on your ship . -Hunger and morale (even on easy settings) drain pretty fast it'll be annoying to new players. -Your crew doesn't eat to get full, they just fill half of their hunger in TAVERNS because the pirates are badass guys... Right?-Also the game is BLUR for some artistic and feel reason of a genius, if you want to turn it off; sorry man, take another bug and leave.-In conclusion, it would be right to rename this game to ""Pooping Simulator 2014"".

												The game was fun at first... before I started encountering bugs. Then they just flooded in. Crewmates and the captain not responding to commands, crewmates doing nothing but using ranged attacks (which are weaker and take longer to ""reload""), crewmates suddenly forgetting how to grapple to the ship (resulting in them just fumbling into the water), etc. Some are really annoying, and others (like the not responding to commands one) are gamebreaking.

												4.0/10Great game, except it is a bug-ridden horse***t. Heard a lot of good things about this game. I'm guessing it got worse as time went on?The game feels more like early access or beta test version, and only couple hours into playing I encountered a ""two captains"" bug which forced me to kill my best crew member. Aside from crew randomly failing to get on board the ship correctly and plunging into their deaths - which apparently is part of the game design -, I encountered random mutiny bug late game when I got about 18 crew members, and had to resort to constantly loading/saving the game which was extremely frustrating that I finally gave up.More about the bugs:Two captains bug - it happens when you load/restart the day in the midst of battle; your ""first mate"" becomes the new capptain, while the old captain is still alive. You effectively have two guys with [C] on top of their heads, and the bottomleft side health/hunger/morale HUD constantly flickers between the old and the new captains. I tried looking into editing the xml savefile to no avail. The only way out was to kill one of them.Random mutily bug - Someone in the crew keep mutinying randomly even though morale/hunger gage are full and I constantly pay their salaries every two minutes. It started happening after I hired bunch of new guys to train as♥♥♥♥♥♥removers while I train my older crew to man the guns, and it's extremely frustrating because the one who mutiny is chosen completely at random including my old crew whom I've invested in significantly. It happens while sailing, while onboard enemy ship, while on land/town/tavern you name it. Again I tried virtually everything including teaching everyone to clean and poop less, increasing the ship size to almost twice the screen width, installing sword stations to keep them busy and separated, etc.. - oh and of course paying them every two minutes and stocking♥♥♥♥♥♥load of rum and food. At first I suspected a sudden and synchronized pooping of 20 pirates caused flash crash in morale, so I taught every one of them to clean and poop properly; no not it. I installed 5 pictures and 3 plants and separated them into groups of 6~7 across the ship; no not that either. I even went into xml file and changed crew traits that are potentially negative such as 'liar', 'greedy', etc., and increased friendship points; still happens. We take down Lv.8 pirate ship and the captain is busy running around enemy ship looting chests and urns, and one of my oldest and best guy (lv 40) decides to ""go bad"" in the middle of 18 other guys and kills himself instantly.Few other bugs/quirks that are worth mentioning:- Ransom kills do not increase ""renown"" points. It says it does in the game, but in the savefile it is stuck at 0.- Stations that increase pirate stats, such as swords, books(?), and grinding wheels are almost unusable because they are like pirate magnets; all my fishermen guys are busy sweating with swordplay and end up starving the crew.- Cannot place cannonballs at sea and must dock to place them. why?? also since when cannonballs are called ""bombs""? Never would've figured that out on my own.- When you try to move few pirates at once, one or two always ends up not getting the order and stay behind.- Teaching swimming is a must since when you move a large group of guys(~10+), one or two will always end up slipping and falling into the sea; and this is without ""careless"" trait, mind you.- Other minor interface glitches: After selling the same items a few time (such as wooden block) sound is gone. You feel like something is broken but it's not. When you close shipbuilding interface while placing a block, block info HUD remains on the screen. Come on guys, these are pretty basic stuff.All in all it was pretty interesting game; with great potential. I really enjoyed the game otherwise I wouldn't have played it over ten hours and tried so hard to ""fix"" it somehow. However the game has some very serious shortcomings, such as unfriendly and glitchy user interface, broken game mechanics, and some serious bugs that could completely ruin your experience. For that I'd give it 4 out of 10. I personally believe this cannot be a production version, v1.0+. If it were early access/dev beta I would've understood, but this isnt. Lastly, from now on I'll ignore any ""official"" reviews that gave this buggy software 10/10 and go straight to reading customer reviews first. ""Mostly positive"".. Wow.			"

												It's a fun game, I do have enjoyed it several times.But there have been my nitpicks that removes the replay value of it.- It's hud is not user-friendly, Several aspects that involve scrolling, item management, selling, and stat viewing could all be improved.- Sailing part is rather boring, although real sailing pretty much works the same way, but there was pretty much nothing else to do but sitting in your chair, waiting untill you've reached your destination.- Objectives were pretty much the same, it could have some more variations.Overall, the game is fun though, it has it's sillyness that I've enjoyed while playing, and the management of hunger, crewmates, cash and morality were great mechanics.I've enjoyed several fights and music as well...and man...those penguin sounds....I don't even.But, should I recommend this? After thinking for a while, I decided to say no.The game has it's bugs and nitpicks, and their updates have been really low lately, despite my expectations.Personally, I feel like the devs have abandoned this game in order to have more focus on their new game: ""Pixel Privateers"". at the moment I've more expectations on that game in the future. so it might be better to save your money for that one.

Early Access Review
								As it is right now in Early Access, I can't recommend this game. It has a lot of potential and I'm sure all the kinks will be ironed out, but as it stands right now, the game simply isn't fun for me. Nearly every single playthrough threw a new problem at me, whether it be my captain getting stuck in a building, controls freezing up or even cloning myself and having 2 captains somehow.I love the concept and style and I want to love the game itself, but I'm finding it very hard. Every time I get into it and things start rolling, something comes along that ruins my enjoyment. I'll update this review accordingly as the game is updated.			"

												To put it nicely, this game is extremly buggy, the controls are dodgy and somewhat awkward, and the gameplay is terrible.This game has good potential, and I hope it updates to be a decent game. Other than that, I regret wasting my money on it.			"

												Honestly, it's not great. it's extremely ok. Very repetitive, not enough to do (sail, kill boat, kill more boats, sell. build boat). I would pay maybe $5, but not at it's current price. Also my eyes hurt from the horrible instagram filter that plagues the screen.			"

												As of right now Pixel Piracy does not seem anywhere close to being finished and out of alpha. Pixel Piracy has potential but as of right now it still feels very underdeveloped. Gameplay feels repetetive, AI tends to be buggy and the combat system is a complete joke.			"

												To get this out of the way in advance- I don't know how I spent 20+ hours on this game. I took a lot of time trying to justify this purchase and find something good in this game but I instead burned out fast. Also I left it running in the background while I did other stuff, but we'll get to that later.Apparently, this game has gotten a little better than when it launched, as it's at least a stable, running program that does what it's meant to with some degree of consistency. This has had the unfortunate side effect of revealing it to be a poorly designed and thought out game on several other levels. A lot of things in this game, from the stock Unity pregame config menu to the bizarre use of the English language, lead me to believe that this is less a project someone worked on because they wanted to and more a product hastily thrown together for commercial release.Character creation is arguably worse than nonexistant. There is a character creator at game start, but you just shuffle through random selections until you find the one you want. This is made a little easier by how limited the selections are, and also how little they matter, as you'll see little of your own character in this game. You have direct control of where the Captain goes and who they attack and that's about it. You need the captain nearby to open chests and dig holes but they're otherwise a regular crewmember. If your Captain dies, they're unceremoniously replaced by another nearby crewmember. You might not even realize it happened, and realistically, even if you do it won't notice unless you were particularly attached to your starting character.The central idea is that you build a ship and sail around, destroying other ships, looting and generally doing pirate-y things. There are towns, islands and other ships scattered around the world, and as you sail further towards the edges of the world, enemy encounters increase in difficulty. The problem is that this ""difficulty"" is entirely contrived. Enemies get bigger ships and more crew members for the first few levels, but around rank 5 the ships start to get samey. Coincidentally, this is the rank at which cannon combat becomes a major factor, necessitating a 30-second wait before boarding can begin. The fact that you can't control your gunners' targets and that their AI occasionally locks up for the entire phase doesn't help. Eventually all that increases is the level of the enemies you fight, and by that I mean their HP- and, more troubling, their tendency to know a skill that causes them to violently detonate on death. Otherwise they're not much of a threat- a team of four with decent stats and good weapon experience can handle most ships in the game with no meaningful injuries.In combat, you have almost no control. You can try to direct your captain and crew to attack specific enemies, but they seem to just do as they please, usually aggroing onto enemies that attack them. Since ranged weapons can hit through walls, this means they get juggled between targets a lot and spend much of a boarding operation pathfinding up and down ladders. Trying to watch what's actually happening is meaningless, because the already tiny characters will bunch onto the exact same location. It's actually easier to just watch the equally tiny readout at the bottom of the screen to see if any of your crew has died, and wait for the sound that indicates that all the enemies are dead.There's also islands, and that's about all I can say about that. They have enemies on them and items you can activate. There is one that can be exploited to gain a ton of TP over and over, but for the most part the gains are miniscule. Having to kill thirty natives just to get to two coconuts and a chest with 15 gold in it is less than busy work. A few interesting things are set to happen on islands, but few actually do because of how badly optimized the game is. Far too many times I fought an islander, reduced them to near-death and saw the screen go dark with the prompt for them to surrender and join your crew, only for them to die because the prompt took ten seconds or more to appear. Islands also have treasure that you can dig up with a shovel that costs more than several cannons. Most of these treasures are garbage, but using treasure maps you can dig up some interesting equipment, and in attempting to use it you'll have to do battle with the game's interface.So much of the game is reliant on your pirates, so the menu for equipping and leveling them shouldn't be so much of a mess. All pirates are sorted manually into groups that determine how they're used- the player can never select individual pirates other than the Captain, only entire groups at once. Your crew also never use their skills naturally, as their AI is entirely determined by what group you put them in. This almost entirely means that Ship Crew is the only useful group, as they prepare food and clean♥♥♥♥♥♥off the decks, which is 90% of sailing really- the Training, Gunnery and Boarder groups are only useful if you have a handful of specific items placed on your ship, and presumably Custom 1 (of one) just idles until they get hungry or given a kill order. The problem is that these groups can only be changed by going into the crew management menu, which is a hot mess to say the least. The biggest problem by far is that after selecting a crew member, the only way to go back to the list of crew is to close and reopen the menu. There's no way to sort your crew at all, and the game's internal sorting seems arbitrary- your captain will often end up somewhere in the middle of the top row, even if they're consistently the highest leveled among your crew. This same menu is also how your crew uses items, and between the battle interface being literally unreadable and the menu being difficult to navigate, healing mid-fight is an impossible task.So much of this game seems to have been added in because it was a popular game mechanic and not because it was actually considered in terms of meshing with the game. You can ""plunder"" towns by killing NPCs, but shopkeepers have normal pirate drops, so you're really just locking yourself out. Ships take damage from cannon fire, but enemy crews will just board you well before you deal enough damage, and when they're all dead you can blow the ship up automatically anyway, so really the damage to ships only affects the player ship. There are many different island types and a lot of rare encounters you can find, but they all boil down to ""bump weapons with enemy until death"".By far, what sealed this for me- not just ""this game is bad"" but ""I need to tell people this game is bad"" is that this is all there is. The objective of the game is to defeat the four legendary pirates. They are placed at the corners of a square world, surrounded by rank 9 encounters. Sailing in this game is tedious- the game loads an empty encounter, adds a percentage to the top corner of the screen and makes you wait while it counts up to 100. Nothing happens while you sail but eating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Events take place in between this, not during. Everything between point A and B is skipped. Enemy ships can interrupt your travel, but there's no pursuit or retreat, just an optional 60% chance to attempt to evade before you're stopped dead and forced to fight. You do this until you reach the corner and meet the game's final bosses- ships at about level 4, with the exception of a single pirate with 600+ HP. They die the same as any other enemy, and you're left in the far corner of the world with the knowledge that you have to do this all three more times.Normally people say this kind of thing with hyperbole, but I entirely and earnestly mean it when I say that this game has caused deep levels of personal regret through my time with it. Looking for improvement made a passable game seem dry and tedious instead. If it were free, I would still not recommend it.			"

												Eh, i wont complain about food/morale, because its easily addressed by stocking barrels of watermelon/rum in the ship. That said, theres some silly problems that stop the game from being good just yet. Pathfinding glitches prevent you from making a interesting looking ship (rafts all day everyday). Game mechanics of statistics arent really balanced, items either do too much (crab meat is OP jk...but not really) or too little (things like some items adding +1 dmg or -1dmg). Only way to get gold seriously is blowing up pirate ships instead of opening treasure chests which is counter intuitive. Not being able to name your pirates prevents imersion. Theres a whole list of other glitches really which is sad because i still had fun despite these problems. Wait a while for them to fix it!			"

								Pixel Piracy is a game like you have never seen before. The ambience is great and I do have the feeling to scream ARGH and AYE MATEY. THe gameplay mechanics are great, you can be the king of the seven seas. Plunder ships, capture them or just let them be. Find islands, kill the natives and steal their treasure. Everything is possible in this beautifull game, called Pixel Piracy			"

												Cant really recommend this game because there is just repetetive grindy gameplay (and bugs) in itThe game is basically just grind lvl 1 ship and loot their money until you can get lvl 2 ships and so on.Later you buy even more pirates and a better ship to grind more lvl 2-3-4 ships or isles.Mostly the only reason you really die is because you attack something too soon, like all your 5-6 pirates with 20-30-40 hp attack pirates who got 220 hp. Its a nice game for a couple of hours but then you have seen everything in it. Defeat the 4 legendary pirates(obviously only after lots of xp and money grind)Only thing that stands out are abillities you have to buy and teach to pirates and the ship building. I saw this game during early acess and during release, i think the devs really tried to make a good game but it lacks any sort of different gameplay except right clicking your enemy and see the people spazz out by trying to knock out each other(from the boat). Sometimes you encounter bugs, like you have the abillity to clean the floor but your character just wont do it.You can grab it on a sale and make yourself an own impression but its just a waste of time playing this game.The grind doesnt justify the mediocre gameplay.

												I'm not sure how good this game is for some people, but I got a glorious copy. I mean I turned on the game. Got to answer a few questions that would shape the game for me. Chose my character's looks. Then the moment I spawned, I died. I don't mean that I messed up and got killed early on. I mean the second I started I heard a weird sound and the game said that I died game over. And this lovely game took me to a page with a list of improvements put into the game with no way to do anything. All I could do was copy that info on a clipboard. I closed the game and ran it again hoping that I could actually play the game, then was taken to this page again. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled it and it still took me to that page. Gotta tell ya, 10/10.			"

												My gosh this game is plagued with bugs.  Thus far, I haven't even been able to play a single game for an hour without game-breaking, yes, game-breaking bugs.  Sometimes my crew gets permanently stuck when getting off the ship.  I can reload and go somewhere else instead, but that's just a waste.  Just now, I started making improvements of my ship and lo and behold I get some bug telling me that a point was unreachable.  I thought ""Okay, I'll just delete that point"".  Ended up deleting the entire ship and once I put on a single cube, it's unreachable.  Ridiculous.  And my ship was completely flat before, too!  How's that unreachable? -_-.  While I wish I could give this game a good review, these bugs make it impossible.  Truth is, I like the game... when I can play it.			"

												The concept is awesome, the idea has a lot of potential and there are tons of interesting mechanics BUT it's not finished yet. The game has a lot of bugs, and by a lot I mean it sometimes is unplayable. Here is the full list of bugs I've personally encountered:- Cleaning crew idling instead of cleaning poo- Fishing crew just spamming the hell out of the fishing rod instead of just waiting for a fish- Trained cannon operators won't shoot. 5 cannons on the deck, all have cannon windows and plenty of ammo > they just refuse to shoot.- Crew eather not leaving your ship to raid the enemy one or refusing to leave the enemy ship once you're done with it. This results not being able to plunder ships without sinking your crew early on (when not everybody have swimming perk)- Not being able to edit ship at all (even when docked). Trying to remove or place anything on the ship literally does nothing.- Not everyone eats at tavern. It eather happens randomly or not happening at all. Was pretty tough to keep the crew fed after our fisherman got killed.- If you left click on an enemy during the preparation phase when encountering enemy ship (30 second period before you are allowed to board), your captain will board their ship and start fighting completely ignoring the boarding timer.- When you try to learn Sniper Shot perk, it will be equpped as passive for some reason, therefore rendering it useless.- Sometimes you can't scroll the list of your weapons then selling them to the arms dealer. Same thing applies when you are trying to scroll weapons in your inventory.- Morale icon disappearing above some of the crew members- Crew singing happens very rarely. I think it is suposed to be somewhat of a morale booster but crew sings like once a couple of real life hours.Well, that's about all the major bugs I encountered.For an Early Access the game was okay. But for a full game release it just has too much bugs and especially AI glitches. If you are fine with these gameplay flaws, I'd surely recommend this game, other than that - wait for them to fix at least half of the current issues.P.s I will be updating the list overtime.*was edited due to ""lazy review no research"" comments			"

												I like this game pretty much, kinda a 6/10 piece, still worth the money if you buy it at 50% off imo. However I cannot recommend this game, due to all the bugs it has and the developer abandoned the project, means they will never get fixed. here are some of the games flaws:-Too little naval cannon actions, ships rarely sunk by cannon bombardment, which makes the standard cannon nearly useless against larger vessels. On the other hand, swivel gun is much more effective for it targets the crew and reduce their HP, makes the following up boarding much easier.-Some facilities on the ship such as rum buckets, training swords, training weights are not very useful, the crews rarely use them or not at all. -Pathfinder is buggy. The crews and livestocks sometimes just jump overboard for no particular reason, making the swimming skill a must have. Sometimes they even got stucked when trying to reach food and water, and gain hunger because they fail to reach the resources.-Cannot assign the ship blocks or sections. Crews and animals just wander around at their will, makes it difficult to do any micromanagement. The crew's job divisions didnt really help.-Looting takes too much time and micro, once you take over the enemy's ship, because of the nature of this game's control mechanic, you can only loot one item at a time; hell, what's all the crews for if they cannot help you hurl the treasure chests/urns?

YouTube™ Video: Pixel Piracy ✭ Pirates Aren't Free, They're Dumb 

			Views: 215		

			It seems getting to grips with the nuances of this game will take a while... My playthrough of Pixel Piracy on PC with live commentary.		

Pixel Piracy is the only game I know of where the results of your time investment can just randomly be taken away from you, leaving you in a state where its almost impossible to progress with the game.You take the role of the captain of a ship, build yourself a crew, buy them food and pay their wages to keep them happy, kit them out with the finest of weaponry... Oh and fight other pirates in navel warfare... Sounds cool right?Except when you tell your crew to go board the enemy ship and, with their captain mercilessly slaughtering enemies in front of them and the expansive blue, shark infested sea behind them... They choose the latter.And that's it, they're gone from the game.Taking with them the initial hiring cost, however much food they've helped themselves to, items you've used on them to cultivate them into the perfect ship mate you've always wanted...All because the game makes them walk left instead of right.And this was a consistent issue, which meant I couldn't progress that far into the game because I was constantly spending all my gold replenishing my ranks.I bought it cheap in a sale, so maybe I shouldn't complain too much. But as bad as other games I've played are, they at least haven't decided to just randomly remove the results of my labours because the AI can't work out what to do.But there's a lot of other little issues that as a collective really just suck all the fun out of playing.Quite often after issuing an order to a ""group"", some will decide that obeying their captain isn't in their best interests. Then I didn't mind them drowning so much.When you select somewhere to go on the map, you're treated to a ""traveling"" transition... Where you just watch the ship sail while a percentage counter slowly increases. Sometimes your crew sing a shanty. I have no idea at all why this is in the game other than to pad it out.Rewards from chests were usually around 10g... After returning to the ship I was blowing up the enemy ship for 100g. The rewards are just garbage.From what I've seen of it the actual gameplay loop gets old pretty quick; go fight pirate ships, go explore tiny islands, go back to town for supplies, repeat. The game gives very little incentive (at least short term, as I've said I've not really been *able* to play long term) to actually play.The menus are unpleasant to look at, I'm fine with the pixel art aesthetic, but the menus are just really unintuitive and take way longer to navigate than they need to. I couldn't even find my items for the longest time.I have no idea how they managed it, but the framerate would regularly slow to a crawl in towns.I like the idea, but I hate playing the game.This is even playing the ""enhanced"" edition.

It's concept is fantastic, but... and there's a big BUT... there are so many bugs that make this game not appeal to me anymore. Countless times I've been doing really well and gotten so far or just started and I will find a big bug that means when I send my captain to the boat sometimes he will grapple on to the boat and it will glitch out and he will then proceed to climb the rope to his death into the water!GREAT! I wish they would go back into developing this game. :( If this magically happens I will change my review.			"

												As I take a wrench to the game, try to imagine I don't enjoy writing this. But this game is unfinished and terrible. The most time you spend on this game will consist of character set up. Trying to make a decent looking Captain and regretting each voice choice you make, because they are all wretched. You either get high pitched idiot, unclear foghorn bellowing, or an actual child reading the voice script. I am 98% sure actual children did the voices and they just edited those clips for the other two random options. Oh yeah, all voices are randomized, no way to pick and choose like the clothing. The world generation options are super unclear too (danger, mystery, drama?) and all your little minions are INCREDIBLY annoying. They all repeat the same one liner at loud volumes over and over. You get a little cosmetic changes as you reach the farthest edges of the map, but it's just background trees and how the blocks look. I'm probably going to add more later. Just wait till I get to the gameplay, this is all audio and graphics. It's ALL disappointing.			"

												I have spent many an hour enjoying the pixelated seas, so I am quite sad to thumb this down. I honestly feel the game was so much better at varying stages of development (and of course was easier to be forgiving at those times, with hopes of more to come). Like many others I kept coming back to it to see what had changed or been redone, and after playing about 12 hours the past couple days I am really disappointed to find that the game is far less playable than it used to be.I always played on Legendary because it was really a boringly easy game otherwise, but now I find that legendary means you run into enemies with godly stats almost immediately so I haven't been able to find a balance of challenge/enjoyability again. Furthermore, there are a slew of odd bugs and features that were legit just removed for reasons I can't tell. I read somewhere the AI was rebuilt from the ground up a ways back but it seems to me for the absolute worse. -Captain and crew can get stuck on the shore edge about 30% of the time in my experience, resulting in constant loading just to workaround that issue.-The dodge rate seems to do almost nothing anymore (im assuming this is due to enemies having a really high dex stat and so their hit excedes my dodge... but cmon, level 3 islands and enemies with 300 hp who never miss against my 200% dodge?) Dodge used to be super op a couple years back so in a way it's almost nice, but might as well ignore the stat if it's so easily trumped now, unless you really want the small attack and move speed buffs it provides-AI seems even less managable... was always hard to keep your units doing what you'd like: they auto change targets(same as always), crew automatically all try to go to land when you reach a town with a bar(as always, but you could before select ai options like ""run away when low on hp, or never go to shore"" which are now just gone (and with the shore bug you wind up losing half your crew if you aren't diligent about stopping them from landing)-Graphics, omg... the 'effects' just made it hard to look at, I find myself constantly wishing I could disable the huge amounts of blur and the constant meteor shower of pixels going right to left on my screen. Seems like these things made performance worse than the first time I ever played. My old ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop ran it fine back then and now my pretty decent desktop rig starts getting sluggish in the midgame... I can only imagine the endgame is choppier than it even used to be, but can't stomach testing the current version any further.I could ramble here, as there are a myriad of other smaller bugs and issues that I'm sure you could google readily. Just really bummed because I loved this game as a time sink in the past, but can't even bring myself to enjoy it anymore despite sincerely trying for a couple evenings in a row. Really feels like the game got worse since the last time I checked on it, and I truly wish they had just left it at an earlier state because I honestly used to like it, as my hours played indicate.

Early Access Review
								Pixel Piracy is probably one of the most prime examples of the pitfalls of early access. Pixel Piracy is nowhere near finished. It's startlingly low on content, depth, and polish. It has a well thought out conept, and it has the solid groundwork of an enjoyable and well-executed game, but that's it. The result is a semi-enjoyable, yet extremely repetitive and frustrating, prototype of a game. The actual game is a strange but creative mixture of FTL and Dwarf Fortress, as you manage the various needs of a group, which you need if you want any hope of survival, namely health, hunger, and moral. You do this by managing them in combat, feeding them, paying them or supplying drinks. They level, you teach them important skills, and spec out their stats. The macro management is relatively fun, as you choose to teach what to your various crew. Do you want to invest in teaching one guy fishing, cooking, and cleaning, or are you too worried that he'll die too easily in some wayward skirmish, or would you rather not overburden one super-crew member and rather disperse the work? Having a large crew is nice, but also expensive, in gold and in food. This form of management and gameplay, along with watching your ship grow to be larger and larger and more functional as you personally design it, is the meat and potatoes of Pixel Piracy, and they are enjoyable and well done. The base game is there, and it's good. The graphics and audio are also charming and polished. The problem, however, is virtually everything else.Pixel Piracy suffers from four primary issues. First let's just talk UI and general control. It's terrible. Shockingly so. Controlling your bundle of haphazard pirates is an absolute pain, and the AI is attrociously bad. There seems to be no rhyme of reason to how your crew wobbles about, as you cannot seem to get them to prioritize and enemy and move in one motion. They need to be heavily baby-sitted through every single command and action, and if you cannot coordinate this collection of bumbling idiots, one of them will die. Very rarely do you feel responsible for any of the deaths, either you have not the slightest clue of what's going on, or the AI just decided that it doesn't want to play along. The fact that it takes about three or four clicks to get the entire crew and their captain to prioritize a certain enemy is just downright idiotic, I'm honestly confused how Re-Logic messed this up as bad as it is, and the simplest aspects of the game and genre, no less. I applaud them for trying to break the mold, but they have to do so with some confidence that it's bareable, which the controls of the game are just simply not. You eventually get used to it, but it's still an infuriatingly awkward design, to describe it briefly and crudely, it's like someone tried to combine elements of 2D point-and-click adventure games with typical top-down RTS games, and no, it did not work out. Oh, and don't even get me started on the map movement and menu setup, it's just as frustrating. You learn through experience not to use the menu or customize your ship while your captain's in a shop.The second issue is how the game adapts to the rogue-lite genre. First of all, there are three modes, normal mode, hardcore mode, and for some reason an arena mode, which showcases by far the weakest aspect of the game --the combat, which I have already explained-- in a typical horde-like fashion. The normal mode gives you the option to save before every movement on the world map, which basically removes any weight from any mistake you make, unless it's a macro mistake. You can die as much as you like and just reload, no problem. No decision carries any importance. Okay, you may think, then just play on hardcore, which has no save feature. There in lies the rub. Due to all of my previously stated greivances about the controls and AI, combined with the game's incredibly random and confusing nature, it's near impossible to play the game feelings as if it's anymore than the roll of the dice. All the time, some tiny detail with go wrong, and literally everything will be ruined. A good rogue-lite/like will wear you down, kill you over a serious of misfortunate events, will make you pay for many little mistakes building up. In Pixel Piracy, the AI just messes up once and everything's over. Just once, the rest of your crew just decides not to follow their captain into battle regardless of their given orders, and next thing you know the game's over. Not to mention that the game has certain checkpoints, namely surviving until you get a sustainable three-person crew with cleaning and cooking abilities and when you intergrate cannons into your combate, that so suddenly kills you that it feels like your efforts meaning nothing in the palm of the RNG gods. Especially during cannon fights, which lack any option of escape after commitment, you can die so quickly and easily it makes everything seem pointless.The third issue is just pure lack of polish. The game is incredibly repetitive, and it's buggy. Pirates falling through blocks, feces hovering inobtainable in the air, a cook who apparently just forgot how to cook, so on and so forth. And the entire game is just the identical ""throw all your crew at once at the enemies' face and see how has the larger numbers"" over and over and over, with only slight various in enemy type. Except when you get cannons, then it's just resource management mixed with spamming and RNG. Oh, and there's like two events, both just boring text across a blank open sea, which boils down to extra XP or paying gold instead of fighting an uncooperative swabbie. It's mind numbingly dull, just busy work in order to get resources to manage. The game desperately needs more meat on the bone.The last issue is just the general confusion and unnecessary learning curve. It's not a matter of discovery of cryptic items and attributes like Binding of Isaac or Dungeons of Dredmor, it's a matter of just figuring out how to play the game. Learning the backwards idiosyncrasies of the AI, or how to cook food, or how to just manage your crew, is not fun, but frustrating. There is no direction, and almost everything is head-scratchingly unintuitive. This is the early action problem, the core aspects of the game, aspects it desperately needs to be enjoyable, are just not there yet.My suggestion, wait on it. The game is currently not worth $15 in the slightest. Maybe it's worth the grind if it's half off or less, but even then, I would suggest waiting. I expect this game to get a lot better, as Re-Logic has proven itself to be a good developer, but right now, it's just not in an enjoyable state, not even truly in a playable one. I would suggest against impulse buying Pixel Piracy, in it's current state, it's just not worth it. Wait a few months, watch its development if you're interested. When the game fixes it's AI and UI issues, and more seriously designs it's the meta of the game and genre, I could see it being fantastic. Until then, put it back in the oven.			"

												TL;DR  -  The game feels unfinished, not worth the asking price as it stands right now.I played the game for a while... It was fun until I defeated the first legendary enemy and realizing every 4 legendary enemy's threat level is 10... What is the point in travelling to every corner of the map to face the same threat level?I can't recommend the game for the current price because the game feels unfinished as it stands right now. Also keeping in mind that the game is already released ""Release Date: 23 Apr, 2015"". If the price of the game was lower then it's definitely worth the hours you spend on it though.Also I'd like to say that if it had multiplayer then it would take the game to another level of fun. Maybe would have to cut out the RPG elements though, as someone could always be a higher level and it wouldn't be as competitive that way, unless of course it was based on co-operative gameplay instead of PvP.

												Most reviews already highlight the many problems with this game. It's buggy, the AI of everyone is terrible, and it's just flat out boring. You are essentially just having your crew board another ship, kill everyone, grapple back to your ship, and then hit a button to increase your gold by x amount. There's almost no loot besides weapons, that only sell for 1 gold each, ship battles are dull and amount to a few clicks and then letting it do it's thing, and the sailing is terrible. It's honestly the worst. You pick a point on a map, click ""Go to destination"", and then you sit there and watch your pirates do nothing while you spend at least a minute every time going somewhere else. God forbid you're more than a few markers away, or else you might want to grab some coffee and a snack, because it still won't be ready by the time you're done.I could not recommend this game to anyone in good faith. Not even worth the money I spend to get it in a bundle.			"

Early Access Review
								Such a shame that this game isn't better. The idea behind it could make this a great title but it falls short due to lack of many little things.Firstly, the way your crew and your captain respond to things is absolutely awful. The AI here is enough to make you want to quit alone. Pirates will get stuck and fall in water (they can't swim and die), They won't be able to get off your ship unless you stick to only a really simple design, and they'll go into battle solo when you didn't even tell them to attack that target.Secondly, things are just too expensive without enough payout. I was generally hanging on by a thread because the risk / reward is so narrow that it would cost me a lot of resources to make just a little money.The control over the pirates, and just the whole game in general seems very clunky.I really wanted to like this game because I enjoy pirate type games but I just can't until they get these few things straight. If I could do it again, I would add this to my watchlist and keep an eye on the development until those things were fixed.			"

												This game is surprisingly addictive and very easy to pick up the basics, I throughly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down until I finished the story mode. Unfortunately once you do achieve a certain level it does become a bit tedious and repetitive but you could always start a new game from scratch. It's very much about the build up of your captain, your crew and your fleet. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something simple and fun though.			"

They take some weird shortcuts with sprite animation, the sprites themselves are a little ugly, combat and exploration is a little bland and monotonous right now, and hopefully they'll fix the buggy, clunky menus soon, but when they finish it, this'll be a great game!

Early Access Review
								I bought the game during the Steam Summer Sale which was June 19th - July 2nd 2014. At it's current state, the game is unplayable to me. There are numerous game-breaking bugs that ruin the game for me, such as:-Crew Members will not follow orders-Only the Captain will respond to orders when giving a group command (Such as Gunners, Boarders, etc)-When capturing a ship your crew will fly into the ocean (I wish this was a joke)-Captain decided to grapple to the bottom of the ocean That's just to name the few I've experienced in my hour of play.Overlooking the bugs, I think this will be a good game when it gets out of early access. However I cannot really assess the game in it's current state as I can't get far enough to experience anything other than 1 or 2 ship battles.			"

												Pixel Piracy is a great concept for a game but currently there are a lot of problems that makes it difficult to enjoy. The biggest problem is a lack of any useful tutorial in a game that is moderately complicated. There isn't a lot of helpful tooltips or anything useful on the help page and 4 hours in I still find myself search for answers on the internet to find out what is wrong constantly or how to do things I should be able to do, such as firing a cannon after buying cannons, ammo and using the cannon firing skill. Another huge problem is large portions of this game involve doing nothing. Everytime you have to sail somewhere which is very often you merely watch your pirates sail on their ship with little to no involvement. This plays itself like an extended loading screen every 2 minutes in game. The last problem that is that controls are very minimal in this game and I find myself at the hands of the AI constantly even during battles. A battle can vary wildly from complete victory with almost no health lost to my captain dieing because he decided to fight on the edge of the ship and got pushed off. There are of course smalls ways to remedy these things however a better remedy would be having the player be far more involved in battles.Overall the game is complex and engaging but has some major problems. It is definitely worth trying for cheap or worth revisiting later.			"

												Pixel Piracy is an interesting game that revolves around leveling up your characters and your gear in an attempt to take on harder and harder fights.  For me, the game was the most fun in the beginning and then started to get more boring as it progressed, especially traveling accross the map to the different legendary pirates. I feel like this is one of those games that you buy and play for a couple of hours and come back to it in 6 months to do another playthrough. I would guess that the average person would get around 15 hours of play out of this game (if you like it) so you can judge for yourself it that is worth the money. One thing I really hated about the game was the item leveling system. If I could suggest any changes to the developers of this game I would beg them to change this. The game emphasises progression and getting better weapons, but when your starting weapons grow to an insanely high level you will never use the cool new weapons you get becuase your starting weapons will be so much better from the leveling. Overall, be sure to do some reasearch on this game before you buy it and try to buy it during a sale if possible for the most bang for your buck. If you have any questions about the game feel free to contact me and I can answer them! :)			"

												I want to love the game, but there are too many game-altering bugs. The ones I keep running into are pirates getting stuck on the edges of islands and pirates deciding to not clean the poo off of ships. Even if they are trained.So my games are always, ultimately, a bunch of diaper wearing pirates that are sailing a crap-filled boat (you can't really afford diapers for the whole crew and the trained cleaners don't clean), who are usually dying after falling off a beach, because they usually don't know how to swim. Not the experience I expected.			"

												Ok before i am judged for my good rating I shall explain. The game has high and low points so to start off I shall give the low points of the game. 1.The beginning. Honestly I just found the beginning boring i wanted something a bit more exciting than just appearing at the menu.2. The directions. After I made my character I was so confused on what to do next. I looked at the help section but it didn't help much. So honestly I dont think it was implemented well. Now for the good things in the game.1.  The freedom. I enjoyed the fact that the game doesn't hold your hand. You have to learn how to do things. Its doesn't explicitly tell you. The fact that you only have one objective and that is to beat 4 major pirates gives the player something to work towards while exploring and pilaging like a pirate. I didnt have to go talk to npc's to unlock new areas I could go wherever I wanted. But bear in mind that even though you can go anywhere  you should be cautious. You run the risk of sailing into an enemy that could wipe you out in an instant.2. Creation. I loved the ship creation the most, you can make what you want and it is awesome. I also love that you have the option of capturing a ship if you kill the crew.3. Stats and leveling up.The leveling up in the game is fun and how you get skills is cool. Also the fact that your pirate can have alot of different skills. Leveling up feels good cause the stats influence gameplay heavily. For example if you upgrade strength alot your character will be a tank that can kill enemies easily,or if you increase vitality you can last longer in a battle. It is small things like this that make it enjoyable. All in all this game is not for everyone. However if you are willing to put in a good amount of hours into it you will be satisfied with what you achieve. Especially if you like leveling up games.I rate this a 7/10			"

												So after a while i discovered a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs that makes it almost impossible to play this game.At this moment with its current release (Version 1.0) i can not recommended this game.Let me explain what else goes wrong.Controls, they do not exist in a good way. Sometimes you need to act fast and give your mates orders, but its not working because there are only a few simple orders that wont help you in many situations(Game its like controlling a Sim, but you dont know why that guy isnt doing what you want...)The Help Page is a good start but it isnt really helpfull in a detail. You will find yourself searching the web after a while.Useless crew, i dont really could figure out why should i buy more crew members. I was fine doing with my Captain alone. He doesnt consume as much food, his morale is mostly fine and since the AI is not listening to your orders you are not raging as much you would do otherwise.In my opinion this Game is not finished, i dont know how the late content ist because i never reached that because of bugs.Now let me explain the bugs:It seems like if you put more food in a barrel(Meat +7) it simply breaks the barrel and the chef is ignoring the barrel. (Some food as to be cooked by a chef)You can not design your Ship as you want, because if you do any mistake(you simply dont know what you did wrong) the AI keeps walking around and simply tries everything at one, leading to a walking crew member that walk up and down.Some of my crew members where dying for no reason. They simply explode while sailoring. Since there is no what happend log that you can scroll up and down. Reloading where helpfull this bug happend only 3 times in my gametime.I have done bounty hunter mission, after sailing away from the island i ran into a fight that i have lost, i pressed r(reload saved state) and wanted to buy on that isle some health potions, and the bounty mission was done, like before but the guy where alive again and he♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me so hard that i could not get away. Game Over.So as you can see this game offers a nice gameplay and it makes fun that is no question, but this comes to an end when you encouter gamebreaking bugs. I hope they will update the game as soon as possible, then i will ofc delete this review.If you want to work around the bugs i can guarantee you it will be very hard.			"

												51 hours playedBought when it first came out, enjoyed it and the format was interesting however I didn't enjoy the bugs.Left the game.Returned recently - some years later.The game still plays a really low quality sound clip as its intro and this should the summation of the game. When I first played I let it go expecting it was a placeholder but still after years they have not improved such things.Bugs ruin your gameplay;-you are forced you to rebuild your ship to deal with invisible poo that stops all cleaning operations-you are forced to reload your game multiple times on some occasions as the crew/captain get stuck on the shore-your cannoneers will shoot into your own ship-the UI is not smooth-progression causes persistent laggBasically the director became ill (very sorry to hear but glad you regained your health) but the developer gave up with the game from what I hear and both have started a new game seemingly abandoning this game. Although they claim they are patching and fixing it is just not good enough for the time they have had to fix this game.I will not be buying their new game simply out of protest - developers have to learn at some point they cannot simply abandon the product people have paid good money to play but cannot due to bugs.WHEN WILL THE DEVS LEARN? WHEN YOU STOP GIVING THEM MONEYIf you fix this game I might consider looking into your new game.On the plus side I enjoy the character voices and the combat is fun although the stat mechanics are fairly simple.I love the ship building although not when I have to keep rebuilding my ship to get rid of bugged poo.I could really love this game and recommend it however I just feel disappointed.

												Game feels incomplete.Lots of info are missing, sometimes I can`t see the X from the Treasure Map inside an island. Later I was able to see, but I don`t understand exactly why. Maybe it`s Intelligence?Pets are useless.You wouldn`t know that Int gives Discount when buying things.Travelling takes a huge time and is annoying.When you have a huge crew the constant noise of them chewing food makes me insane.Game becomes way laggier on late game to the point my cannoners are able to shoot 8 cannonballs at once each.Having to wait 50 seconds to start a battle because of the bordering time limit is annoying as ♥♥♥♥.I really liked when I put one of my crew to use the cannon, the enemy thought it would be a good idea to enter my ship then he killed all my pets, feels awesome.Seriously, just ignore pets, they are useless.Somehow Ranged Weapons can`t be leveled through use. Only through grindstones.Also the tutorial says that you need TP to learn Skill Books, but I think they changed it so you don`t need TP to use skillbooks anymore.If you have someone fishing, he ignores the fact that he has Skurvy and dies if you don`t do anything.Fishing sucks, they are useful in a certain part of the game, but then you start getting huge amounts of money, so you buy Soup / Melons / Sea Biscuit which are thousand times more effective than fishing.Fisher can`t repair Ship.Chicken can't make eggs somehow.Pets are useless.One time when I was doing a bounty quest when I killed the guy, his corpse didn't get thrown out of my ship and the quest bugged. So the island was empty but I wasn't able to get the quest reward.You should really have at least one character going full int, the price discount is very nice.Agility is overpowered, having a character with 40-60 agility is better than any other stat.Somehow when playing on legendary, high leveled Islands are really tough. Animals not only have lots of evasion but sometimes the massive amount of enemies over there keeps knocking you back. I guess when you get 12+ crew + cannons it becomes a lot easier.			"

Early Access Review
								note: I've updated my review to make it shoter and more consise, as well as to reflect recent updates to the game.So, this game is an alpha on early access. I bought it after watching the video, which made it look really fun.Well, some alpha/beta versions of games are really fun and polished. Some aren't.The question is, as of now is it as fun as I thought it would be after watching the gameplay video? Not at all. I really like pixels and I really like pirates, so I absolutely like this as a concept. But as the game is now I don't recommend buying it until a lot more work is done.It's too grindy, everything takes too much time investment to get, and is too easy to lose in a fight. Pirates start with absolutely no skills and you need to buy books to teach them everything AND have talent points to read the book on top of that. If a pirate dies all your investment is gone.The game world feels really static. You ""encounter"" enemy ships and can choose to engage them or try to run away, but once you commit to enganging them they just sit there and don't attack you. Pirate ships don't move around on the world map, either.Only buy the game now if you want to fund its development, not because you want to have fun playing an early version of it.			"

												Ok,Don't get me wrong this game has some great potential. I think this would be an amazing game if it weren't for a few things that I personally find hard to get past. First of all I dislike the AI for crew mates and captains. You will order them to head in one direction to escape but they turn around and charge the enemy. On top of that the world menu has a VERY rough design. I think if they made that to fit the scheme of the game it would be very nice looking. Some of the good things about this game is suprisingly it has a ton of action. I just don't reccomend this game because I can't get past the glitches. If any of the devs see this and fix those issues post a comment and I would love to try it again and change my review.			"

												I will recommend this game, but cautiously to a few. Pixel piracy offers a 2D RPG platform game with minimal controls. Pirates in essence manage themselves while you the player, tell them where to go, organize them in groups, and ensure they have enough food to eat. The mouse allows you to control your pirates. Jumping ship to ship or to land is as easy as clicking over the location (or at). Some ships cannot be boarded right away, but are in range of cannons. Cannons fire while the ships approach one another. Boarding another ship can take some time as the ships have to come into proximity with one another. The ships don't physically move, but the timer countdown at the bottom does (hue hue hue hue[static.tumblr.com]). There are different types of cannons, and not everyone can use a cannon. Different pirates can acquire different abilities once given a skill book. Some can navigate faster, some can heal others, some can repair the ship, and some can specialize in combat. Pirates can be put into groups by the player to make selecting easier. For example, some pirates will have the ability to fire cannons, therefor putting these pirates into the ""cannon"" group can keep them on your ship while telling trainees, ship crew or other groups to go board and attack. There are specific attributes that can be upgraded with each pirate. Strength, vitality and dexterity are a few attributes to consider. I've mostly focused keeping them all nicely rounded, but it does help to have a few guys with good aim on the cannons, or wielding a gun. Passive items such as cooking knives can be given to pirates, as well as a secondary side arm meant for ranged attacks. Ranged attacks can be in the form of tomahawks, to flintlock pistols. When boarding or attacking another pirate's ship, once all the opposing pirates are deceased, the player may choose to capture the ship or sink it once all crew members are safely aboard your ship. Sinking a ship will give you some material and gold.Ships can be modified to ones will, given the right materials. When docking on islands, the ships food supply can be restocked, cannons can be added, and even ship materials can be added to expand the boat. Building the boat in the editor doesn't require a lot of skill and is straight forward. Islands boast different shops. Some will have taverns (to hire pirates), some will have goods and item stores, some will have weapon stores, and some will have ship stores. Within these stores small little gimmicks appear as the player should read the fine prints of each item carefully. Pirates need certain items like fruit to prevent scurvy (you'll notice randomly some pirates will simply lose HP). Some pirates that you hire are not up to par, and at the ship store, spare swords can be bought for them to practice with. They need to be installed on a ship manually for it to come into effect. The visuals are appropriate for the game, and have some small effects that really require a double take. Animations are smooth and kept simple. Sounds are varying as all pirates will have something different to say, but have no problem repeating themselves! The most notable sound in game is the splashing, it's refreshing!I like the game, but once you get to a certain point you'll have enough of it. You'll feel like you've done what you can and the only difference is the level of your opponents. This is why I'm carefully recommending it. For a game that is ON SALE and worth a couple of bucks, it's not bad for a few hours of entertainment. If you really want replayability from this game, you'll probably lean to one side of the fence. There is the exception for those who like endless adventure and like competing for a top score. Indie Rating : 7.6/10Standalone Game : 6.0/10A multiplayer feature somewhere in the game may have added a few more points. I would have liked to have a bit more control over my pirates and been actively involved in the fighting rather than observing. Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots :  This is what you will be commonly looking at While in the loading screen, pirates go about their business I've upgraded to a bigger ship This is what the world map looks like My biggest ship to date "

One of the most surprising Indie games i have seen around in a while, and here is why: First of all, its innovative gameplay blends the apparently incompatible genres of Crew Management and Roguelike-RPG, and does so surprisingly well. The freedom given us from the very start of the game is total, and the possibility of building and customizing every part of your ship and any aspect of your crew gives a real forward boost in the overall freedom experience given to the player. Even if it has colorful palettes, a minimalistic (but indeed functional) HUD and rather simple base mechanics, you will be surprised at the complexity of the overall system as you proceed in the adventure: from a small group of pirates, you will be in charge of managing a large crew, composed even of tens of individuals, each one with its up and down sides, needs, skills and behavior. Soon you will take the role of a true captain, assigning each member of your crew to the job which suits them best, ration the food supplies, teach the right skills at the right guys, and be careful to do that, because in Pixel Piracy every mistake costs lives, and coins! If the management part seems deep enough, then you will be lost in the exploration one. The game features procedurally generated worlds, this means every game will be different, every island a new discovery, every encounter a different fight. Repetitivity is a stranger to this game, because with the combination of hundreds of randomly generated items, tools, ships and enemies, it is successful in mantaining itself fresh and new every time you play. The combat system is also full of fun and depth itself. Battles will be always different in relation of where they take place. A battle on an island can see your fellow footsoldiers roam through the sandy beaches, staining them with red blood, aided by the ship's artillery team raining death upon their foes, while a battle in the open sea is a true confrontation of two captains and their own vessels: cannons blazing, bullets flying, pirates drowning, hulls breaking and men boarding each other's ship with fierce brutality and desire for loot. Only the best skills, tactics and yeah, also luck, will determine whi wins and who sinks. Well, that's all folks, there are other features in the game but i decide to leave them upon you to discover. There is a big world in these little pixels, and it is full of wonders.			"

Posted: November 22, 2015
												I had a lot of fun playing this game. This is review might be a bit like a guide if you read later on about stats.   As I recall, I managed to get this game from one of the bundles so I got my money well invested here.   In this game, you start with the first character as a captain of your measly ship with no cannons.   Early on, you will have no money to hire pirates to work or fight for you.   There are many different skills that can be learned from books which can be purchased from stores or uncommon drops from pirates and loots.   The funny thing is that you need Cleaning skill to sweep your ship clean of poop, literally.   So naturally at start, you will be having bundles of poop on your ship before you come across a Cleaning skillbook.   I'm going to make a list of Pros and Cons:Pros1- Design and build your ship (check out screenshots submitted by players, one looked like Star Wars' destroyer ship)2- Can hire up to 20 pirates making you feel like you have a real army going.  Especially if you had 15 of them as boarders...or even gunners...shreding ships apart before 30 seconds timer to expire allowing boarding3- Different game every time (But as I noted under Cons, the ship/island scenarios are repetitive)4- Variety of melee and ranged weaponsCons1- This game is not exactly finished as there are few things I can tell that need to be fixed or implemented (you may encounter some bugs.  I once encountered a game-breaking bug when I was stuck on a corner of a block on enemy ship, they would not target me, I could not fire my pistol at them...making it seem like I no longer exist there, had to reload but all was fine that point on)2-  Now, I said that you play this game different every time as this is a good thing.  But the scenarios is probably 1 major patch away from being just about right.  The ship and island scenarios is all you will encounter in the game.  Once you see both of them,  it is pretty much 90% the same.  The only difference is levels of difficulty, which increases as you move farther away from your starting point.  So naturally this hampers replayability.4- Interface need some optimization or something.  In-game scroll is a bit of pain as I can't use my mouse scroll button. This is enchanced when you got a long list of items to navigate. (and that is another thing, no subcategories of items)5- While this was fun at first, but after recongizing the optimal way to develop your war-oriented priates and yourself,  the fun start to fade out quickly as you and your pirates become overwhelming powerful.  Case in point,  getting your dodge chance (via increasing points in AGI) to 500% (if you are a lone wolf attacker; and 500% because the more enemies on you, the higher penalty on your dodge chance)  No one can really hit you.  Up against 8-10 pirates on the ship, they get to hit you maybe 2 or 3 times.   As I said about ship/island scenarios being all virtually identical other than levels of difficulty (Edge of map is 8 to 10), it gets dull after while seeing you single-handedly shred them apart repeatedly in the virtually same way over and over.   6-  As some reviews may have noted, the stats are vague,  what they directly tell you is what it is but there seem to be additional things that impact them.The stats are (and you start with 1 in each):STR:  +5% bonus damageVIT:  +1 hp regen / +1 armor per 10 VIT points / +6 health per VIT point (You also gain healthpool via leveling)INT:  +2 passive XPDEX: +5% ranged damage / +2% hit chance (Base is 90% hit chance so you start at 92% because 1 point already)AGI:  +5% dodge chanceLUCK:  +1 critical chanceI finished my first full game as of this review so my comments and experience with stats are:STR's 5% bonus melee damage per point is very straightforward.Next game I am going to try maximizing VIT to determine the effect of +1 armor per 10 VIT points.  As of now, I assume it reduce damage taken by 1.  From my experience from taking damages,  it looks like I take up to 30 damage or little so.  This exclude  bombers as they hurt quite a bit (Gunners that happened to have cannon ammo on their hands when I boarded)  So in theory, if I manage to get VIT to 100 (can be more)   I probably would be immune to about 30-40% of enemies in the game.  I will try this in my next game. INT's passive XP is what it is, you actually gain XP periodically.  Increasing INT allow you to gain more passive XP over time.  But this alone is junk.  At level 120, I need about 30k exp to level which I can level once per high-difficult level pirate ship scenario.   What it does not mention, is that increasing points in INT seem to increase % learn from skillbooks.   I noticed that myself had just 1 point in INT (as I never bother with it) while my ship crew  have all points in INT to help them level faster.  When I read skillbooks to increase my already-learned skill levels, I didn't gain very much which meant I needed multiple skillbooks per level.   Now when I gave certain books to my shipcrews with high INT, they only needed 1 skillbook per level.   So increasing INT allow you to benefit more from skillbooks however in the long-run this is not worth it for pirates including yourself that board and attack pirate ships.  INT is for pirates that stay on the ship and do duties. DEX's 5% bonus ranged damage is straightforward,  now about hit chance%.   The higher difficulty pirates have more points in AGI which higher their dodge chance.  So naturally you will want to increase DEX a bit to compensate for that.AGI's 5% dodge chance.  This is what that is going to break the game for you.   If you invest (and you pretty much always should)  AGI all the way to 100 (500% dodge chance)   you, as a lone wolf, can single-handedly deal with Legendary Pirate's ship alone.  The more enemies on you, the higher penalty on your dodge chance, so naturally at 500% dodge chance already, you still will have near-100% dodge chance.  You might take 2-5 hits in the entire battle.   Luck increases your chance to critical hit by 1%.  Naturally this might not seem worthy to you at all.  But to be frank, after AGI, this is the best stat ever.  STR is pointless as if you invest all 100 in Luck.  You will be critically damage enemies every time.  5x critical damage.   Naturally you will want fast attacking weapons to take advantage of critical.  Technically STR's 100 points = 500% damage which match critical but this does not include ranged weapon.  So Luck is definitely better.  After 100 points in Luck,  every point you invest in STR or DEX for ranged,  the 5% bonus damage is actually 25% because of critical.   The game is already seemingly trivial with 100 in AGI,  with addition of 100 in Luck,  everything became comical...and dull after while.  I quickly went straight to the corners of map to deal with 4 legendary pirates and get it over with. (but you can actually keep playing after this,  the game goes on forever, pretty much which is nice for players who adore this game.Anyway, my rating of this game is 7.5 / 10. Probably would be 8.5 or 9 if they release just 1 more major patch for this game but they already moved on to making next project with 10 people.Edit: with my test game focusing on nothing but VIT stat, at level 20 with 40 points in VIT.  I felt no  real improvements with +4 armor.  Either armor stat is a placebo or too small % reduction. I compared during combat against a single person. Was #9 VIT then added 1 VIT point to make it #0, gaining +1 armor, yet to see any reduction in damage. Abandoned test game, +10 armor (100 VIT) isn't going to be worth it.  So I am now considering these stats of  STR, VIT, and INT to be useless. The gain to get from these aren't worth it compare to other 3 stats.  Invest only in DEX (up to max 40 for optimal hit chance against high difficult pirates), AGI (up to 100) and Luck (100).  Anything beyond, just invest whatever.			"

												Maybe I'll give it more time later, but I really did try to get into it. I just couldn't. Having to look up how to play the game is super troublesome, it should have some sort of tutorial rather than just telling you to read all the help info. It took me far too long to even figure out how to actually move to a different island. It's cute and has potential, and maybe it gets better later on, but the steep difficulty curve and lack of clear in game help on how to progress killed it for me.			"

												It's a great game. Let me start out by saying that. My only gripe is I feel like it was forgotten. At least give us a one final patch or an occasional seasonal patch or something. I get a glitch where crew memebers will wait right on the edge of an island and not move, then when I try to manually move them onto the ship they jump into the water. Very upsetting. The ship builder is hard to use because you have to delete and create 1 block at a time, gets more lag the larger your ship is.			"

												Pixell Piracy is a mixed box for me. I\'ll start off by saying that yes, I did sink over 4 hours into the game first session, so the game is certainly enjoyable and rewarding to some degree. However, lack of UI clarity and a vague item description hold this one back. Here\'s a basic list of pros and cons in my opinion.PROS:-Lots of islands to visit.-Fun but simple combat.-Killing pirates and getting loot is satisfying.-Neat pixel graphics.-Expanding and building your own ship/crew is enjoyable and motivating.CONS:-UI is vague and difficult to navigate.-Weapons stores tell very little of what the weapons actually do.-When buying crew members, it\'s basically a box of chocolates; you never know what you\'re gonna get (again, thanks to the crummy, nondescript UI).-A constant loot stream in the side of the screen makes it difficult to keep track of any particularly good loot you\'ve gained without checking your inventory periodically. I got this game on sale for roughly $2.50. I figured I could supplement one cup of coffee this week for a full fledged indie game, and I think it was worth it. I look forward to continuing my adventures in the open seas with my crew, Captain Trevor, Mickey, and Vidali, but not before the interface gets a substantial overhaul. 7/10			"

												The game is cute (when you disable all the fancy graphics that just makes the screen awfully blurry..), and addictive.But the UI is clunky, informations are not easily readable, I've never seen an UI so wrong and so ugly (it's just... no don't look at it, it's really awfull),  and you will spend a lot of game time in this horrible UI...Also  the game is very repetitive (but kinda addicting so...).Musics are sweets but sounds are awfull. And whyyyyy the music stops whenwe are in the menu ??? The menu is already enough horrible it could have been a bit better with music. But no.Maybe it was ok for an early access game, but now as a finished game it's not.Not worth the full price. Too bad, I really loved the idea of playing a game about piracy :(What a disapointment, worst indie game I played :(			"

												I bought this game because it had a permanent death feature, which deletes your save if your captain dies (Unless one of your crew members had the First Mate perk) Like it used to be. But it seems that the whole feature has been patched out, I can't find that kind of mode anywhere anymore, and the game is way too easy now. You can just load a game whenever anything goes wrong, and all the crewmembers are considered as ""First Mate"":s.If you're not a fan of roguelike style playing, where you lose your save when you lose your character, then this is a good game, fairly entertaining, but missing the main element for me.

												This game -can- be a very fun game. It's easy to spend countless hours on this. You can build your own ship and gather your own crew to explore the very vast world while gaining numerous loots from defeating various enemies, both in land and by the sea (enemy ships).The ship-building aspect is the most fun to me; different design gives you different advantages and challenges. Bigger ship doesn't always mean better. You gain parts to build your ship either from stores or from raiding other ships. HOWEVER there are three glaring issues the devs need to fix.- Very poor documentation. For the most part, you have to figure things by your own. Like cleaning your ship from poos (yes, your crew will poo from time to time). Not cleaning your ship affects your crew quality of life. I had to google for this simple information.- Poor user interface. You won't feel it during early hours, but near the late game where you find yourself amassed with numerous loots, it will start becoming tedious to manage those hundreds of items.- Lack of varieties. This one you will also feel near the late game. After you've traveled 50% of the world map, you'll know you've discovered most of the world. You've seen all varieties of enemy ships, islands, and towns. Despite those three glaring issues, I still recommend this game. It's still a decent game if you like open world game.Get it ONLY when it's on discount. I bought this game in a $5 Humble Bundle.			"

												This game is awesome and I could quit my review with this quote.To be honest, the first time I played this game I thought: “Okay, first time you bought a game you will never play again.” I tried it two days later again, figured out many things and then the pure fun began! You are a captain and start alone or with your father (first laugh when I read his name), it depends on the settings and the difficulty you choose and your goal is to beat the four legendary ship encounters and this will be a tough way. You start to play, fight against the crew from other encounter ships, skill yourself with experience points and have to choose wisely what you do with your won skill points. Raise strength? Raise Health? Or better train them to swim or properly poop? :D Your crew will become hungry and grumpy (take care that they not turn against you!), so you should buy food, train your crew to fish and another one to cook. I remember that I starved on my first try to play the game. You are also able to take jobs as a bounty hunter to kill a good skilled pirate, if you think you are strong enough to make it. There are so many funny things they say and chanties they sing to raise the moral, or the items you can find (of course will a pink bra boost your moral!!) And also a big negative item I don’t want to spoil. And don’t forget to plunder and takeover enemy encounter ships or just build your own awesome ship. You will not regret buying this game. The developers told to release a big patch in future to boost this game into a enhanced version, without buying a DLC. I communicated with them and they really care so much if you have any kind of problems or suggestions to improve this game. Get it, before someone other does!			"

												If only this game played like it looked in the trailer. The menu system is extremely buggy and despite being able to put your crew into seperate groups to better organize them it isn't saved on death or loading a saved game. This becomes a huge pain later in the game when you have a huge crew and you've specifically set up certain crew members for certain jobs.You can hire new crew members but have no control over what kind of stats they will have or what type of character they will be. Your main character has to do all the treasure digging which requires changing out your melee weapon to a shovel half the time. The combat system is very aggrivating. Once in combat you can't control who your crew is going to attack and will often mean you are in a corner fighting while the rest of your crew is on a free for all rampage to the death or victory. The only way to keep members alive is to constantly pause the game then load the crew member screen. Not to mention if you do not teach every single crew member to swim they will die if they get knocked in the water which later on in the game happens a lot. The tooltips in the game for items are very vague. Half of them feel poorly translated from another language other than english.I didn't spend much on this game and I'm glad. This game is no where near the quality of Terraria so do not let that trailer fool you into thinking otherwise.			"

In Pixel Piracy you take control of a boat owner with very little coin in your pocket, you go into the tavern and recruit drunks to helper you slaughter the innocent and loot them for coin. Then upgrade your ship, weapon, and skills to take on bigger, stronger crews that do their very best to stop you. Then if somehow you survive long enough you may be able to find one of the four legendary pirate and try to plunder all of his loot.

												Pixel Piracy was quite the unexpected experience when I started playing it, and in a good way. I expected some crappy little game with barely anything to it other than steam trading cards, but boy was I wrong.Pixel Piracy is actually quite fun and entertaining to start and learn. You are essentially a captain of a pirate ship that you control and want to kill the 4 notorious pirates in the end. There are a plethora of things to do, abilities to learn, and items to obtain in this game. The game is a lot more in depth than I thought and they even including certain little things such as pooping and cleaning up the poop. Speaking about poop, some people even have the trait that makes them poop more Kappa. Further things included are ones such as map reading, scurvy, swimming, treasure maps, and more. Honestly, this game has just so much in it. I have even been murdered by my own crew before in this game very soon. Furthermore, the music and graphics for this game fit well enough and the gameplay is fun.Although I liked a lot about this game, I did get annoyed a bit by the voices in the game as they are always speaking with these really annoying little voices.Rating: 7.9/10Recommend Price: $2 or under			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game on a whim. I wanted a game where I would control a crew of marauding pirates, pillaging every last piece of gold I could get my scallywag hands on. At first, the game seemed to have a high learning curve. I would get into scuttles, and find my self screaming at my screen, because my crew would lie dead before me. However, after some time with the game, I began to learn its mechanics and understand how to keep my crew from mutiny and certain doom. Favorite part? Definitely designing my own ship, and taking it into the water. 9/10			"

												Sadly, I really wanted to like this game. However, it feels cheap and not fun. There is a lack of controls and there is something missing gameplay wide. I really gave this a go, the idea is good but the execution is poor.			"

												I never write reviews. But my experience with this game has me wanting to share.  I have waited for release of this game because I wanted to experience all the game had to offer.Pros++A fun exploration game about pirates.+Build up your own ships.+A variety of enemies to fight with different styles of ships and islands.++Deep crew leveling system with a ton of customization and skill specialization.++A lot of weapon types and a weapon leveling system.+Open world - create your own adventure.Cons--Combat can be a bit clunky and can be exploited. Lots of pausing in early game to heal your guys.-No reason to return to low level territory.---Game breaking bugs still exist (didn't want to continue due to the bug)--Game becomes repeatitive after a few hours.Missed opportunities\\\\No dynamic trade system to travel with goods from one area to another (with higher and lower prices).\\No difference in ship blocks besides decoration (can't buy better sails, stronger hulls, or better cannons, ect.)\\No options for a fleet or keeping captured ships.\\No strategy in combat (more guys, more cannons, and more supplies usually = win)Even on steam sale I could not recommend this game due to game breaking bugs and being a disappointment with missed opportuninites to deepen gameplay. Not all hope is lost, this game could be fixed with new content and bug fixes in later updates.			"

												I definitely recommend this game, but it comes with a notable caveat; if you try pulling a Noah's ark in this game, it will lag. Terribly. The issue seems to be that even if you have a well-sized crew able to handle all the cleaning, during ship encounters the crew doesn't clean, so the animal poo piles up, and once it does the game lags tremendously, even after the ship is clean. Restarting the game was the only fix (without changing the animal count) until another ship encounter inevitably causes the issue again. I wouldn't bring this up if it seemed an extreme thing to do, but as there is an achievement for capturing 50 animals you'd think the game should be able to handle even a quarter of that. I ended up having to toss a lot of my animals sea-side, alas. :(With that in mind, here are the good points of the game. If you're someone who likes to loot and level up in plenty, you'll find the opportunity to do so here in spades. I didn't find any kind of level cap; I was at level ~160 by the time I finished and there was still much more I could do. The downside to this is that over-leveling makes the legendary pirates look terribly easy (especially the ones without cannons, shame on them), and I was never boarded even once. :PA lot of other reviews discuss the lack of novelty with new areas, but that didn't quite bother me, as I saw them as just opportunities to level up more and build up an even more bad♥♥♥♥♥crew. For the enjoyment in the game was the story I attributed to my crew members through the trials they faced (like the time it was just two of us on the initial one-level vessel, and we single-handedly took down a medium-sized Order ship :P), their little personality blurbs, and unique statting they all had, preferring some to have more strength vs. dexterity or the like. So the game offers to you as much as you're willing to put into it. If you prefer games though that present a real story for you to follow along with however, you should look elsewhere.This is probably the longest game review I've written for a game and it's because it's been such a journey, like day in and day out for over ten days on this game, it feels more then just silly pirates messing around. My pirates had character. Definitely will be revisiting this game in the future because the pirate life is the one for me~			"

Early Access Review
								Has a lot of potential. Been playing it off and on for awhile now. One great thing is the designer is actively changing stuff all the time. The bad news, it changes a bit too much. And not always for the better. Instead of focusing on really working on the user interface (making it clean, simple, intuitive), the designer is focusing elsewhere. And yet the game isn't getting any more fun. I'd go ahead and skip this one for right now. Check in, in a couple months to see if any great strides have been made here.			"

												Game breaking bugs and lack of developer support crippled this game. I bought into the early access sale a few years back because the game developer was active on Steam forums and generally put out content or bug fixes every few weeks. They even included community found bugs in patch notes and replied directly to anyone having issues. However, the support has stopped as they've focused their attention on their new games. The developer chooses to ignore the state of Pixel Piracy and have stated it is ""done"". By no means is this game complete or bug free, the bugs that are present will leave you frustrated or unable to continue on your current save. They've also abandoned any updates on GOG.While they've managed to clean up your pirates poo problems in this game, it still won't help the poo that is the game itself. So avoid or check our their newest game.Just a note that this was published by a developer on the Steam forums:""There are no plans for new content, workshops or stuff. This game is finished. We focus on another game, so I hope I don't disappoint you. /Chris""			"

												The concept for this game is sound. A fantasy RPG/exploration game where you manage a crew of pirates sailing the seas in search of treasure and adventure. Unforunately, I can't recommend this game because it has several game breaking bugs that make it not worth playing. Two major issues I had were that the pirates, on occasion, just decided to stop cleaning the poop on the ship and that made it nearly impossible to upkeep huge pirate groups. Another game breaking bug I encountered was that occasionally pirates would just get stuck and not respond to directions. On some occasions, they would even get stuck on the edges of islands or boats and end up falling in the water and drowing.All in all, this would be a good game it these bugs were fixed.			"

												Too buggy to be playable. I can't get anywhere in this game, there is a bug where you can't control your crew within the area in which you land on islands. They end up getting stuck and then the only way for them to get out is to jump in the water. Other people are experiencing the issue, and cannot continue any further. If they fix this bug then the game will be somewhat playable, but regardless Pixel Piracy has too many bugs that get in the way of gameplay, and overall the game is just way to easy and predictably long and drawn out. If you want a great rogue-like strategy-based game, get FTL instead if you haven't tried it.			"

												It's a fairly simplistic game about being a pirate on the high seas, but overall, I find it's pretty fun. There are things about the game that make it feel incomplete, like the game using ""thjs"" instead of ""this"" with a female pirate. It also feels kind of disjointed from the rest of your experience, as combat control was limited to what weapons you equip your pirates with, and how characters will automatically do things by themselves. But once I started playing, it was hard for me to stop. You're put in control of the major things, such as building your own ship, which is a massive plus, and details and stats of your crew.If you're looking for a pirate sim, I'd start with AC4 Black Flag, but definitely start this one at some point.

Early Access Review
								I love the idea of this game, and I think once it gets a bit more polish it will be an awesome game, but right now I think it's just too rough. The game itself is challenging, which I love. What I don't love is how not only am I fighting enemies, hunger, morale, even poop, I'm fighting the interface to get what I want done. Things happen and there's no indicator why, like after I beat a pirate ship and go to set sail I'll just get a game over screen when there's no reason given as to why I died. The tutorial is just a slideshow of instructions, that don't explain quite a bit that you need to know. As a new player it is quite the task to even get to a level of understanding that the game can be enjoyed. I can't wait for this game to leave it's unpolished alpha phase, because under all the problems there is potentially a really cool game.			"

												Pixel Piracy is one of those games where your constant increase in strength compels you to continue playing, even though the game isn't *particularly* challenging or interesting, kind of like Mount and Blade. The game is fun, but gets very tedious towards the end where you run into enemy pirate ships every other tile, and you have to traverse hundreds of tiles to kill the four main bosses. That minor gripe aside, PP is a fun, slightly buggy, very unoptimized way to spend some time. I recommend it if you enjoyed Mount and Blade, Sid Meier's Pirates!, or other games of their ilk.			"

												I mainly picked up this game simply because Re-Logic, the makers of Terraria, said they were behind that game. Now come the 1.0 release, I'm able to give my honest opinion after a couple hours in with a lv. 13 captain:The game is very relaxing. It's got some humor in it and a couple of references in it as well (The ones I noticed are from Pirates of the Carribean), what's worth mentioning here however is that there is an emphasis on pirates taking dumps, more than you might expect at a glance, which to some is funny, others maybe not so much. That said, you might want to spend some of your first gold pieces on a Cleaner skill book.Another thing to take note of is that the game still does not have much in the way of content: So far I've only seen pirate ships (Without cannons, we'll see how that works out once I get there) and islands. There is little variety in the types of encounters you might see while playing, which does make the gameplay a bit repetitive. Of course, every one of these encounters will be different, with different ship layouts and assortment of enemies, which makes it feel less of a chore. Also there'll be future content patches for this game, which may further add to the experience.The game also has a fair amount of equipment for customizing your troops, as well as different combat mechanics such as critical hits, bleeding and of course, the drowning of your deckhands should you get swarmed by enemies that attack one character and there is no wall behind you. This causes slight issues because as I was playing through this game I did not manage to have complete control over what enemy my deckmates were attacking, which makes the tactical element of the game a bit harder to execute.There's plenty of charm in the game as well. Many of your new recruits have ""special"" abilities that makes them interesting. I had one that made my pirate attack its teammates every once in a while, resulting in him eventually getting killed when vikings boarded my ship. There's plenty more out there and that is something I definitely approve of.That said, it is an indie game, and for it being an indie game it's definitely not bad. I quite liked spending some hours seeing my Dubstarr & Co. slicing up enemies with his Falcon Blade, and come another day when I fancy some pixellated pirate caretaking, I'll probably look back at my save file and play some more.Plus for what you pay for it, this game's worth it. Especially now with its launch deal of -50%.			"

												Terrible UI. Lots of bugs. After getting a large crew/ship, game lags intensely. Other reviews have stated that this is most likely due to memory leaks. Also makes a loud sound at start screen compared to the volume of the rest of the game. The developers have also stopped making updates and have instead started another game (Pixel Privateers), while leaving this game unfinished and full of bugs.Also annoying with a large crew is that there will be a cacophonous ensemble of noise that happens in the background as crew members yell random things over and over again at you. You won't even be able to hear the background music at the rate at which the crew members are yelling stuff at you. That and each time a crew member poops, it is accompanied by a sound, which also happens every three seconds.Game was fun at the beginning, after you figure out what you need to do to not die and then starting over to get a decent start, but then it gets really boring, coupled with the memory leak and bugs, it becomes annoying to play.

												After watching a favorite youtuber play this game's alpha a year or so ago, I became interested in it. The cutesy graphics, sounds, and titanic amount of poops, all under a rougelike canopy that promised repeated failures all in the name of hilarity and charm, seemed like a worthy title for purchase. The pirate theme also carried it along, seeing how many rougelikes avoid that theme in favor for over-done fantasy dungeons and monsters (not that there is particularly anything wrong with that). However... Now having played it, now having seen the multiple typos, the glitches, the lack of substance... In a ""finished game.""The typos were especially bad... ""Werstler?""If I didn't know better, I'd say this game was still in alpha.Thank for for your time! Go get Terraria, AI War: Fleet Command, Arma, Risk of Rain, Banjo Kazooie (that's on PC, right?... Right???), Tomb Raider, or Alien Swarm (of which is Free, not bad, and in need of players!) instead!There are plenty more games out there that have gone through the trials of release and thousands of hours of playtime and have proved themselves far more worthy of your time than this.Find them.

												The game is highly addictive once you get the initial hang of it. There's a few things that aren't explained very well, which leads you to reading up in the Community Guides before actually being able to play the game efficiently, otherwise you'll get discouraged and rue your whole $1.50 spent... lol.The game is slow-growth to rewarding expansion. It's interesting though, because if you play your captain right, you can send him to solo 4 guys at once or more (I'm only Level 16) on a raid and win, with ease. The key is his Evasion. Then afterwards, everything is chump-change, however a gang of dudes (6+) will nuke him fast... lol.It's fairly simple to understand, as the tutorial covers most of the functions. The HELP could use a lot of work, because its poorly written in understanding and explanation detail. There's also a lot of little quirk about the game that I wish could be changed.—Such As:-- If you have a fisherman with Cleaning, Fishing, and Cooking in his skills, but he has a Fishing Rod in hand, he will ONLY fish. He wont clean and he wont cook, which leaves you to removing his weapon and subbing in something else when you have a freakin' million fish because he's so damn good at it, lol. But then he'll cook everything on the deck and then clean up crap afterwards. -- Selling items is a pain in the #*$(^@#&@*(&ing ♥♥♥. If you clicking fast to dump crap from your inventory, you'll sell off some 700+$ item and hate yourself, life, and everything else while you're at it, because 700 is 3-4 pirate raids. There needs to be an item lock feature, or ""secure chest"" you can put those items in so they cant be sold. Like Shovels and Fishing rods, etc.All in all, hunger and money run the game and if you can master them, the game is pretty much done with. ;)Fun though.			"

Posted: August 14, 2016
												Rating: 2/10This game is frustrating to no end. I really wanted to enjoy playing it, but just couldn't. It was enjoyable at first, but it quickly grew old and frustrating with all the bugs.- Really bad tutorial. The tutorial literally ""stops"" like a quarter of the way in and just assumes that you understand the rest... I thought there would be more to it, but aparently that was it. I had to open up the help menu and read everything before even getting started because the tutorial literally teaches you next to nothing helpful.- Swapping ships is cool, but you somehow can't transfer your loot from ship to ship??? I don't understand... You kill enemies from a ship, but you can't move your cargo over before switching ships. I tried a lot of things to transfer the cargo but failed. There might be a way, but if there was the tutorial never covered it and the UI doesn't indicate it.- Your pirates ignoring your commands is so frustrating. It's a major pain getting them to attack the right targets and not to do stupid things on their own. Retreating from combat is literally impossible as the AI is a potato and your guys instantly die.- If you enter combat with an enemy ship, you're forced to engage with it until you win. You initially have a 60% chance to flee combat at the start screen, but if you fail, YOU HAVE to fight NO MATTER WHAT - even if the enemy ship doesn't have cannons or attacks you... so dumb. I've instantly lost games because I accidentally sailed to the wrong location and was forced to fight enemies a lot stronger than me. I don't know why you can't escape combat after it's started - seems like lazy game design.- Crew with the ability to clean your ship won't clean it unless they are part of your ""Ship Crew"" group... I spent hours in a game where my entire ship was filled with poop and was getting frustrated because nothing was being cleaned... Gee, I wish there was a tutorial or help menu to teach me these things.- You can't give your crew specific orders (like clean the damn poop or shoot a cannon). This makes it really annoying since it feels like you have no control in the game whatsoever. You just have to hope the AI is smart enough not to screw you over in encounters.- Knockback is extremely annoying since your crew can't swim initially. Now, it does seem like a somewhat interesting mechanic at first. However, getting half your crew instantly killed because of one enemy knocking everyone back is really stupid. I honestly wouldn't mind it so much IF YOUR CREW WOULD OBEY YOUR ORDERS AND RETREAT PROPERLY.- In towns with taverns, your crew will jump on the land and eat/drink at the tavern costing you gold. This is actually pretty cool. However, it's really frustrating when you need to recall them back to the ship since you have to select all groups to move back to the ship and then physically click somewhere on the ship. Not only that, but if some crew are slow to come back to the ship, you can have others that will go BACK to the land... There seriously needs to be a SINGLE BUTTON that when you click it forces everyone on your ship.- Sometimes looting ships can get really annoying since a lot of the loot is in jars/chests on the ship. Aparently only your captain character can loot items which is really stupid. And it seems like your captain is the only one that can dig for treasure.- Speaking of treasure, the treasure maps suck in this game. It leads you to a location and it's just a regular island. When digging around the ground you won't find anything. So it seems like I must be doing something wrong? I actually wouldn't know if I did anything wrong since there's no tutorial to explain anything and the UI sucks at explaining things. I may have gotten the treasure, but with no message, it's very underwhelming. Doesn't really feel fun at all when it should be one of the most fun things to do in a pirate game.- Leveling up your pirates is interesting at first, but eventually it becomes a major chore. I love leveling up characters in video games since it gives me more control and adds a bit of depth. However, since you can control 10+ pirates at a time, it's really annoying trying to manage all of their stats and skills. The main problem is that it's very easy for your pirates to die in the game (Combat, Cannon fire, Drowning, etc). It's really disheartening when a pirate you've leveled up 10 times gets killed off by something stupid. I really wish you could set it up to level a particular way and let it auto level.- Cooking in the game seems like it's cool, but it ends up being implemented really poorly. Pirates are forced to cook some food before eating it (like fish you catch in the ocean). However, it seems like only the pirates with the cooking skill can eat the food... they don't even prepare the food for the rest of the crew...- Aparently you can only put food on your ship when you're at a dock in town. So even if you're catching fish in the ocean with a fishing rod, you have to go back to town before you can place the food on your ship. Like what? That doesn't even make sense...- Your ship never gets destroyed by cannonballs. Why? Because the stupid cannonballs kill off your entire crew before it even comes close to destroying your ship. Aparently you can automatically hit any part of a ship. There is no such thing as being protected inside the ship. And since you can't control your crew very well, you can end up grouping them together and getting them all massively injured by a single cannonball. Oh, and make sure your crew isn't standing near the edge of your ship since the cannonball will knock them into the water and auto-kill them...---------------The game had some positives, but I'm not even going to list them since it's clear this game is too frustrating to play. I really wanted this game to work since the premise is so awesome and they do a lot of things right. It's unfortunate that the bugs, lack of tutorial, poor UI, poor AI, and bad controls had to ruin it.			"

								This is a cool game but it still got a lot bugs in it i recommend that u get it later when they fix all the bugs. For right now save     your money on this game and wait on the better things to waste your time on.I hope that my review help a little.			"

												It is cool for the first hour then it gets extremely repetitive and your crew does not listen and usually kills themselves with the bad controls.			"

												Pixel Piracy is a rogue-lite pirate simulator. I will say it right now, It is not for everyone, but I loved it even in it's beta stages. Pros:Extensive Leveling System.Hunger and Morale System that is done well.Difficulty Settings.Great Art and Sound Style.(Debatable) Can be funny at times.Ship Building.Randomly generated worlds.Tons of items.You can seperate your crew into different groups for a tactical aproach to the game.Extensive tutorial. (Press F1)Cons:Not alot of graphics sliders, so the few with really bad computers might not want to get this.Sometimes the AI can be derpy.I havent played the game a lot if you check my hours, but god did i enjoy every single minute. I will give this game a 9/10.			"

Product received for free
												I do recommend this game as a casual game to play when you want to be lazy.Pros -The grapichs are great with very nice lighting and pixel art-Your crew has at least some backstory and each one is different-The only thing your crew likes better then pooping on the deck and fighting is getting payed with gold-Most of the mechanics and gameplay is average to above averageCons -Raiding ships and islands can get pretty boring after some time so you should play it in bursts to avoid wearing yourself out-The game becomes very easy after you reach mid game and the only real thing that is new are the cannons you get in the game towards the end -The game can be finished very quickly with little replay value			"

												The game is fun in the beginning, you travel to different islands in your custom ship, slaughter everything in your path, kill random chickens, hire crew, and blow up boats. However the combat is, well, boring. you just walk up to a guy and pray you have enough power or consumables to beat the enemy, and if you don't, run back to your ship and hope not to get hit by a stray angry turtle. Exploring isnt as fun either. you just walk around on an island hitting stuff and interacting with a limited set of background objects that mostly spawn enemies. Crew management is okay, you'll need to always keep up with morale and hunger. Doing this costs a lot of gold, which you need a lot of if you want to make a big ship. Overall If you like repetative gameplay, you'll enjoy this game.			"

												This game puts you in charge of a Pirate Captain with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and allows you to recruit a crew of incontinent sailors.  Your pirates will drop large, steaming piles of human dung all over your ship wherever they are standing, whenever they feel the need to go -- which is often. Seagulls will land on your ship and when one of your pirates scares them away, the birds will also drop a deuce on your deck.  Inevitably, the pirate involved in the confrontation will pinch off a loaf in celebration. The piles of poo will make your crew sick, but they WILL. NOT. STOP. The only way to mitigate this fecal onslaught is by equipping your crew with Diapers, and levelling up one of several poop-related skills from a modest skill tree.  There is a ""perk"" that makes a crew member into a Poop Machine.  You can train them in Toilet Mastery.The game also features some light exploration and simplistic point-and-click combat.PROS: There are very few Pirate-themed games out there. This is one of them.CONS: This is a game about pooping.UPDATE: The game has made it out of Early Access. Congratulations are due!These are several ""improvements"" added in version 1.0, as per the changelog:   * BETTER POOP SPLASH EFFECT   * Pirates will no longer poop if they are hungry (less than 50% hunger)   * Pirates will now clean the nearest poop instead of any old poop   * Flying poop now deals 5% max HP damage (as opposed to a small fixed value) In a way, it's refreshing that they are sticking to their guns with this.

My captain can't use cannon, the cannon guy explose bombs on the crew FOR NO REASON GOD DAMN IT, and that's just the most frustating things I have seen, there are anothers. Can't you script some things correctly or add script so the player won't kill himself ? Anyway I just spend 2.5€ in promotion so that's not a big deal and it was fun anyway for 3-4 hours... But...And please, PLEASE, I don't want to spend my xp points on EVERY members ! Seriously ! With 10 guys it was already a nightmare !			"

Posted: March 5, 2016
												This game has recieved so much hate, most of the steam reviews are negative, and I would like to explain to everyone why this game is one of my favorite games Ive ever played. Whats the game about?This game is an rpg, management game. You sail to islands and into other pirate ships and conquer your area which awards you with gold, loot, and exp. Gold you can use to buy food (so your pirates wont get unhappy), buy ship building blocks, new traits for pirates (which allow them to do a specific task, like clean the poop deck or use cannons). Loot as in weapons (that are upgradable with rare stones) and passive items (that can give more atk, or can heal a player) and exp that levels up each of your pirates, that you can buy more of with gold, which gives your pirate TP. TP is used to upgrade your pirates different skills, Str Vit, Int, Dex, Agi, and luck, which help your pirates accomplish things more effienciently.The game is not perfectThe game has some issues, there is a memory leak that makes it too slow to play around an hour or so into the game, but this isnt a huge deal. Restarting your client isnt the worse downside a game has ever had, and this problem does not make this game any less enjoyable. Some people have said that the pirate voices make this game annoying as hell. This should not be a problem, In the settings you can turn off these slighlty annoying pirate voices, if you do not care to here ""Avast ye mateys"" about once a minute, so people that complain about this, really arnt grasping the entire game, and arnt really giving you alot of insight of how the game and all of its aspects works.So, why does the game have a few problems? Well, this game was made by just a handful of people, that all had day jobs, this was a side-project type game, and its amazing how much the game exploded in popularity and how great the game is for how much time actually went into it.This game was NOT ""abandoned"" by the developers, these guys worked their ASSES OFF, while STILL having ANOTHER JOB! These developers deserve so much more credit for what they did here. And for those saying ""well, if they havnt abandoned it why dont they fix the memory leak, and other problems?"" They have told time and time again, that to fix these problems, they would basically have to recode the entire game, which would be alot of man power and woundnt pay off as much as this game actually did. The developers have given away free keys to people who couldnt afford it, and these guys are amazing, Im looking forward to the lauch of ""PIXEL PRIVATEERS"" that is coming out THIS quarter of 2016, and I hope many open thier eyes and see that this game really is a gem, and privateers will be even better! :)Judgement 9/10The game is a neat management + rpg styled game, that gives you control of a pirate crew on your quest to defeat all 4 of the legendary pirates, the game has a few issues, like the memory leak that makes you re-open the game every hour or so. But these issues do not interphere with the great idea this game was. The achievements for the game are quite fun to complete and there is quite alot of places you can go and conquer even after you have defeated all 4 of the legendary pirates. This game is one of my most favorite games, if not my #1 favorite, and I believe everyone should try it out :)			"

												I had a lot of fun when i first played pixel piracy, it was something else. And the game kept being fun for a while, but after around 10 hours it started to get boring and repetitive. Move around the map, fight an enemy ship and explore another island. There just wasn't much more to it other than that. In the end of the game it even began to feel kind of like a chore. But I played it, and I'm happy I did. The pirates are funny and the random stuff they say is quite enjoyable (until the point that it gets annoying), The ship battles are fun to look at and control and it's just nice to manage your crew. I am recommending this game because I've had fun most of the time while playing this game and it was worth the little money I paid for it. I don't know if it would be worth full price but if you can pick it up for cheap during a steam sale, you should check it out.			"

												THAR BE BUGS!I've sunk 50hrs into this and while I really liked it, it's significantly bug-ridden.  It's effectively still in BETA however you are invited to pay full price and like me you probably wont be dissapointed.It's thoroughly enjoyable and isn't really lacking in challenge or content however frequent bugs will frustrate you more than your financial investment deserved.  Most issues you can work around if you find your save file and make incremental backups, rolling back an encounter or two to avoid some issue with one of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crew being trapped on a pixel or nothing at all.Shame really because it's a lot of fun.

												If I were the devs, I would hesitate to say the game is ""out"".

Definitely missing the polish of their previous games.That said, it is a very fun concept. Just seems to have been done by a single fella with no artistic ability and only a handful of free graphic and sound resources from around the internet. I'm disappointed at the presentation, and the amount of bugs, but I will keep at it a bit longer (though a bug now prevents me from building anything on my ship above sea level) and eagerly await what should be 1.0, or a patch that brings it to a finished-looking state.

												This is a great game, it is so well designed that I don't even know where to start. There is a lot of depth here that is missed because of the graphics being the way they are. (I like them) There is a learning curve, and here is a few tips along with a link to a let's play video if you want to see the game being played.Tips- Stock up a little food, 2 or 3 sea biscuts on your ship is enough don't put all your food on at once.- Have Fruit or Watermelon on your boat so your pirates don't get scurvy- Get more pirates (always get as many pirates as you can)- Health and Strength seem to be the way to go.- Don't take huge risks. (if you barely survive a level 2 ship encounter don't fight a level 3 next)- Sell bad weapons (Swords, knives, and other weapons sell for a lot so sell them)-  Get a cleaning book, don't send him to fight....- Get a first mate incase you screw up and your captain dies.And here is the let's play if you want to see it being played...

												I have a bit of interesting history with this game.When it first came out, I only had 5 or so hours in the game, and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. I gave this game a 10/10.Then I made a new review for it, a negative one. Stating that the game was complete garbage, and that anyone willing to pay the full price tag for this game were making a very big mistake.So here I am, writing a good review for the game.When I heard that the game was supposedly given new content, and practically remade, I was excited to see what they've done with it.This game was notorious for being one of the least favorite games I owned.I clicked on the dusty Pixel Piracy icon, and gave the game a second chance.I'm glad I did, they have improved this game so much.What they improved, is hard to put my finger on. But they did something that made me happy.I may even go as far as saying that this game is worth the full pricetag. It has improved so god damn much, I almost feel bad for putting it off for so long8.5/10			"

												This game has been available for play for over a year.This game is still experiencing game breaking issues.Here let me list just a few things I found after playing this game for only a few hours.1. Right Clicking repeated to get your select group up onto the ship will, more often then not, cause them to pile up and then having no grapel just fall into the ocean.  If you haven't trained that person how to swim, they are now dead.2. Characters (even the Captain) will enter a stunned state on land as well if you are in any way pushy with your mouse button clicks and they will not move no matter what.  You have to reload to fix this issue.3. Putting a non-background item at the front of your ship will cause everyone to get stuck at the front of the ship when boarding requiring you to right click again to get them to get around the blocking item.4. The game lets you scavenge other ships with your ENTIRE CREW ABOARD.  As long as your Captain is not on the ship you can blow it up and kill your entire crew.5. Vikings have cannons.  I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not.6. Typos.  So many words spelled incorrectly.  It boggles the mind.This game should not be played.  You will get angry.  You will get very angry.			"

												Disclaimer: I'm going to assume that you know what the game is about, and like in this review.I would describe this game with the following sentence: an amazing idea that falls short because of bugs. This game in concept and excecution is amazing, but is littered by bugs, glitches and a couple of design flaws here and there that inhibit it from reaching it's true potential. For one, the framerate dips, especially when you have a bigger boat and more crew members, later in your play through. Another issue that comes with more crew members is poop (literally). Your crew members poop a lot, and poop manuals to teach pirates how to clean them are scarce. This means that your boat will always be a poopfest, and you'll have to keep on stealing other pirate's boats to keep a clean boat. Furthermore, scurvy. Scurvy is a status that a pirate gains when it doesn't eat enough lemons, fish, etc.. This wouldn't be a problem if these foods were easy to find. However, you have to travel all accross the world just to find a measly lemon, and that doesn't even fix it all, because you'll need way more. This makes your crews stats decrease, which affects the gameplay.Although the game has many, many flaws, it's still very fun and I still recommend it due to the sheer enjoyment I got out of the gameplay, and creating fictional storylines with the events that occurred to me in my travels. Get this game, or wait till they fix the bugs. I would get it now because most of the flaws come in the late game, and you'll already have around 6 hours of enjoyment out of it.			"

												What the hell is going on?!I recognize that's not the best way to start a critique, but what the hell? I understand this was a lot of work for you guys and thank you for putting in the effort. However, I can't help but feel that effort went to waste after playing today.First of all, that seems to have gotten no attention. Pirates will still not clean or fix the ship at times for absolutely no reason. Furthermore, I think we need to have a little talk as to what balance means. Balance is tweaking certain values of the weapons and enemies and bringing them closer together to keep the game challenging later on, while not making things arbitarily difficult. My captain ran around with a spear for quite some time. Then finally, everyone was ready and the crew took on one of the legendary pirates. After a long battle the enemy captain finally fell and from his body 'the butterfly' was recovered.  A great weapon, even more powerful than my level 20 spear, so of course I immediately gave it to my captain as a symbol of a hard-won victory. Imagine my surprise when I started playing today and my captain appeared to be hitting his enemies with a bloody wiffle bat. Oh lookie, the weapon we took from the legendary captain suddenly does base damage 17 at level 10........Yeah, sorry first mate Rogers, but could you please give the captain his spear back? Turns out the weapon wielded by the legendary captain turned into a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥overnight.Yeah, you're right, fighting that captain seems a whole lot less rewarding all of a sudden. One might even question why the ♥♥♥♥ we bothered.			"

												At first I was hesitant to get this game, but seeing that it was by the creators of Terraria really swayed my opinion. This game is a fairly simple rogue-like, but it's not as punishing as other rogue like games. The game does get slightly repetitive after a while but I've never had a problem with doing the same thing multiple times.  The combat is fun and easy to get into, exploring all the different islands and ships is exciting, and managing your level and stats is quiet simple. It's a pretty nice game overall, nothing too crazy, but still buckets of fun!			"

												well i bought this game after it was offically released not alpha or beta well they say it wasn't at least. and there is my main problem with it. i bought this game and i had a bit of fun. you build a ship collect a crew then kill stuff with your crew as you get better and your crew level up. then months later they decided to add more♥♥♥♥♥♥and more♥♥♥♥♥♥and patches and changes until suddenly it feels like it's back at pre beta. wtf guys shouldn't you have fixed this when it was early release? i last logged in and after an hour or so my crew mysteriously started dying off and i relized they added a feature where you have to feed them the right food. no more fish and sea biscuitspros: -a casual game that you could run on a computer from 20 years ago with no real issues-cheap price and goes on sale pretty often cons-still feels like you're buying an early release game because they keep changing everything-eventually your crew and ship will easily overpower enemies it quickly loses all challenge after 20 hours -all guides online are outdated and it's impossible to keep them up to date because the dev team keeps changing everythingit's ten dollars right now but i wouldn't pay 2 for it. you can play this game then next time you load it up everything could change on you. if you do decide to play this then make sure you pay close attention to the news feed.

												Could have been a good game, but the memory leak makes it unplaybale after 2 hours of play if you don't have a huge crew or ship. Otherwise if you can get past the bad menu design and the lag that goes with it there is a good game underneath it but half the game is playing it the other is trying to play it.After the game in itself is fun even though you kinda faceroll after a couple hour and some canons on your ship. The enemies are not that smart when attacking often group up when facing your canons. Don't even bother using the management tool during a fight either won't be useful and your pirate will manage to fight it off. It also seems like the ultimate book doesn't trigger any abilities during a combat. Or you can't really see them.			"

												A rather fun platformer style adventure game this is. It is unfortunate then that I cannot recommend it simply for its lack of content. I had loads of fun for this game in the short time I played it. I enjoyed building my ship and hiring the ideal crew, levelling up and gearing everybody, and exploring and conquering with my new crew, but sadly there's not much more to this game than that. Once you get a working crew layout, it'll last you the whole game quite easily and then the cycle of gameplay gets rather boring. Still, the game is cheap so buy it if you feel this amount of content will satisfy you.			"

												Pixel Piracy has the potential to be a good game. That said, the UI is counterintuitive, it has a STEEP skill curve, and, overall, just doesn't feel complete. On top of that, I'm pretty sure that the dev. team aren't working on this. I can't reccomend this game in the stage that it's in. I'll change my review if the dev. team ever actually updates it again. I kind of expected more from the dev. team that worked on Terraria			"

												Have played the game in offline mode a while ago. Pixel Piracy is a strange game. At one hand it's ""complete"" and has attributes suggesting so, but at the same time you have unintuitive controls (and even worse UI), abysmal performance\optimization, and repetitive gameplay. Perhaps it'll get fixed up later or something.			"

								Pixel Piracy is really awesome I am really enjoying it thus far I think its one of the best rouge-like games I have played in years. I love the graphic style and the art style of the game its really fun to look at and the characters and voices in the game makes the game even cute and you get attached to your crew in a very friendly , likeable way. The gameplay is very good and hard also it will take you loads of tries over and over again to get some stuff right but its fun the goal of the game is basically your a pirate and you hire your crew , capture / attack other ships and go to different islands and search for loot and build your own ship and you also need to see how long you surive for. Ill defo be recording some footage and uploading it to youtube soon.The best thing of all is that the developers have uploaded there full entire game on there website for free as a torrent file at www.piracysim.com I just choice to buy the game because I think these devs defo deserve the money for there effort and I don't like pirating games... hahaha you get it?Overall score id give is 8/10 very awesome game! id highly recommend it for fun and to pass the time if your bored.

												This is precisely the (somewhat) casual type of game I was looking for.While there are a few features and graphical items that could use improvement, it's very easy to look past that because of how insanely addictive the gameplay is.Not to mention it's brought to us by one of my favorite publishers, Re-Logic! The same group that brought us Terraria! Vitali Kirpu of Quadro Delta, as I've been informed is the developer behind the fantastic art and mechanics you see in-game. (Hope I worded that right. Wanted to get my info correct and give credit where it's deserved)Onward! To the juicy details!Pros:+Play as a pirate!+Free-build your own pirate ship!+Hire your own pirate goons! (Lots of them about)+Capture pets! (haven't figured out how that relates to gameplay yet)+Visit many, MANY islands in search of loot (and various other things)!+Unique RPG/Level up/Inventory system+Casual gameplay (Good one to play before bed, lots of interaction involved too)+Bit of grinding for items and loot (but the way it's set up, it's not overwhelming or tiring)+Attractive 8-bit graphics (If you're like me and like that sort of thing)+Everything I love in a casual game!Cons:-Sometimes have difficulty building a ship(The game states the 'path to ship is unreachable' when it seems like nothing is wrong. Sometimes I'll have to get rid of a hull block that hangs too low or a background decoration for it to work properly. Frustrating, but no big deal.)-Turtorial could be a bit more descriptive.(I jumped to the tutorial via in-game menu for a few various things [including the ship building thing I mentioned above] and didn't see the answer I was looking for. Again had to figure it out myself, which can be good or bad. Personally, I like figuring things out for myself to a certain degree.)-Crew/Character level up screens aren't descriptive enough.(You get your inventory, physical attributes and can place your crewmates under certain labels [BOARDER if you want them to stay on the ship during battle!], but you have to view their current ailment status above their character on the main screen. Which is a bit tedious and took a while to figure out as well.)-A few graphical elements could use improvement.(The sun and moon in particular look like they just don't belong at the moment. I feel weather effects could also use a bit of improvement. Just my own personal critical opinion.)-No way to 'fire' pirates, but you can always kill them if you don't want them on your crew anymore.-NOT a con, just a warning. Watch out for scurvy!As you can see, the cons are many, but also minute. The pros heavily outweigh the cons in my opinion. I can definitely look past the details I mentioned with all the effort and intelligence that has gone into this game. If you like Terraria, there's a 7/10 chance you'll like this too. As far as I know, there is no form of traditional crafting as far as acquirable items are concerned and building is reduced to you building your own personal pirate ship. Though, I haven't played the game long and I would imagine you could build your own pirate island further on in the game.One can hope!You can make up your own mind on this one.My verdict...BUY IT! BUY IT!BUY IT NAU!!!			"

												Pixel Piracy is an unfinished, unpolished, buggy mess of a game. Its so slow, the control scheme is horrible and so is the GUI. The music is average, the sound effects are repetitive and random. The game gets boring and old real quick. The game has no real plot or real characters. The pixelated graphics are frankly lazy, every island is the same and the background for the world is always the same. Its been abandoned by the original dev and that it's essentially been ""outsourced"" to someone else, so it may not get any better. Yet another disappointing GL game. Avoid! 1/10			"

												Pixel Piracy is actually fairly complex, and simple at the same time. It allows for pretty decent depth with naming your pirates, keeping morale up, keeping them healthy, happy, fed, equipped, and alive. The roguelike's interface is a little wonky at times, but not terrible. If you wanted, for some reason, a side-scrolling pirate simulator, this is about it. Other parts of the game like combat, loot, etc. are pretty shallow, but I don't think it was meant to be a very long or engrossing game. It's fun for what it is if you like silly, pixel-style graphics with a pirate theme.			"

												Pixel Piracy EnhancedIntro: Hello and welcome to my Pixel Piracy Enhanced edition review where I’ll be doing a slightly longer than average review to help you decide if this game is worth your time and money* It’s not*. So this game was made by Quadro Delta and published by Re-Logic the same people who made Terraria. That raises the expectation that the game should be good it was made by some of the people who made Terraria which is universally praised as being a good game. Does the game met that expectation? Let’s talk about the gameplay, graphics, story, and sound to find out.Gameplay:On the games website the game is marketed as a strategy/sandbox/simulation. Is that true? Only partially the game’s only “strategy” comes from the fact you can control your captain and pirates and point them at the thing you’d like dead. The “simulation” comes from your pirates needing food and pooping on your ship since they’re too stupid to realize that they should be doing that on the island and not the thing they live on. Why would they poop on the ship? Because it’s on the poop deck (hur hur hurrr) the game has a very immature sense of humor more on that later. The only true thing that the advertise the game as is a sandbox the game’s map is kind like FTL’s where there are these “beacons” that you can sail to that have things to do on them unlike FTL you actually land on the islands you may pass. Every island you go to will feel the same though more on that later. So how do you control the game? Left clicking for controlling the captain and right clicking for the crew group you have selected. How about combat? It’s the same control scheme left click to tell the captain you’d like that thing dead and right click to tell the crew you’d like that thing dead. The combat must be pretty cool sword fighting on a ship sounds like it’d be awesome, not here you click the target and hope your pirate hit’s harder and more often since it’s pretty RNG dependent one of the biggest variables is knock back where falling off the ship/island means death by very lazy looking shark sprites (no they don’t even have a eating animation). You can increase your odds of hitting by the RPG style leveling system they have where you just slap some points into a stat like strength to hit harder or dexterity to dodge better or put the points into a skill like cleaning this goes for crew members as well. Speaking of the crew you have to hire them at a tavern where they’ll charge you x amount for their services and they’ll have a blurb with what they did before becoming a pirate does that mean anything? Of course not. There’s a moral system in where being on a ship covering in their waste makes them grumpy to mitigate this you could pay them their wages, go fight another pirate, or clean that stuff up. You can also capture and tame animals to be crew members though they’re effectively the exact same thing only dumber (can’t learn skills). There’s a hunger system as well where the pirates get grumpy when their hungry and eventually starve to death this was a big problem with larger crews since they were too stupid to eat when they were hungry I hear that isn’t an issue in the “Enhanced edition. There’s a travel time system that seems to serve no purpose aside from free EXP and loading in the next area. The AI for the game seems pretty terrible where they don’t avoid hazards and don’t position themselves to avoid environmental kills like getting knocked off the ship.Graphics:The game is retro sprite based which maybe a turn off for some since so many games do that since it’s cheaper. Normally they make sure they actually have animations in before shipping out the game though. The animation quality in this game is terrible it tries to do the South Park thing by having the sprite shuffle from left to right and sword swings are just the sword sprite moving from and upward position to a downward position. The games UI is pretty ugly there’s way to much unused space with the color scheme they chose and way too much clicking to get where the player wants. The game’s style is pretty ugly to the point where the game’s cards from steam poke fun at them such as the one for the cat where it says it looks more like a sausage weasel than a cat, that’s all over the place in this game. The water looks decent at least. The things that live in the water don’t though the sharks look pretty stupid as do the fish who just kinda slide around in the water without any semblance of an animation to be found here. The areas the player visits are randomly generated to my knowledge that doesn’t stop them from looking all exactly the same. Every island has the exact same back drop EVERY SINGLE ONE at least have like 3 different looking ones that the game picks out at random for the islands. Making a sprite is a relatively easy thing to do animating one is difficult but that’s no excuse for a game that’s selling for $10. For that can get you all sorts of good games on steam like Terraria all of which will have animations.Story:The isn’t much of one it’s just go kill the 4 big name pirates and you can choose what kind of back story you want for the captain, was their dad a brave pirate, was he a drunk pirate, was he a coward. You get to name the world and decide it’s story by that I mean do you want more pirate encounters, do you want people you hire to be more likely to get sick, or are you a night owl and want night to last longer? Do you want it to be mysterious, do you want it to be a drama filled, or do you want it to be dangerous? That’s all you get. I’m not sure what age group this game is aimed at I’m going to assume kids since the game’s jokes and writing are normally just poop related or pointing out lazy item descriptions you know the highbrow stuff that everyone thinks is funny.Sound:The sound in this are pretty hit and miss the swords sound like hulks of metal clanging against each other the open sea sounds like the open sea but then there’s the voice acting it sounds awful. When you make your captain you pick a voice for them all of them sound like unprofessional, some of them sound like the dev’s child, and some of them only have a line that they spam. There’s singing in the taverns that sounded terrible to me but that might be your thing though. The games music is nothing special it just serves the ambiance although you’ll probably never find yourself humming anything from it.Overall Verdict:I bought this game on sale for a dollar since I oddly enough never heard anything bad about it. I still regret that purchase and this is coming from a guy who will buy games and just let them sit in his library where they gather digital dust. So is the game worth it? No not at all it’s just a boring game it boasts a 40 hour experience what it means it 40 hours of more or less the exact same thing there’s no real story there’s no twist it’s just a game you’d play if you had nothing better to do. It might make for a good mobile game but as a PC game it’s terrible you know a game is bad if the dev is ashamed of it hyping up a enhanced edition releasing it for free and then giving copies away out of his pocket. If a dev is that dead set on building up good will with their community they’ve had to release a real stinker. It leaves me baffled as to why there a so many positive reviews of the game on steam those were probably from when the game was in Early Access. The game just feels like it never left early access there isn’t much to it the graphics the gameplay it all feels like there was more planned for it like more than one backdrop for all the islands and how dumb the AI is.

												The game is highly addictive once you get the initial hang of it. There's a few things that aren't explained very well, which leads you to reading up in the Community Guides before actually being able to play the game efficiently, otherwise you'll get discouraged and rue your whole $1.50 spent... lol.The game is slow-growth to rewarding expansion. It's interesting though, because if you play your captain right, you can send him to solo 4 guys at once or more (I'm only Level 16) on a raid and win, with ease. The key is his Evasion. Then afterwards, everything is chump-change, however a gang of dudes (6+) will nuke him fast... lol.It's fairly simple to understand, as the tutorial covers most of the functions. The HELP could use a lot of work, because its poorly written in understanding and explanation detail. There's also a lot of little quirk about the game that I wish could be changed.—Such As:-- If you have a fisherman with Cleaning, Fishing, and Cooking in his skills, but he has a Fishing Rod in hand, he will ONLY fish. He wont clean and he wont cook, which leaves you to removing his weapon and subbing in something else when you have a freakin' million fish because he's so damn good at it, lol. But then he'll cook everything on the deck and then clean up crap afterwards. -- Selling items is a pain in the #*$(^@#&@*(&ing♥♥♥♥♥ If you clicking fast to dump crap from your inventory, you'll sell off some 700+$ item and hate yourself, life, and everything else while you're at it, because 700 is 3-4 pirate raids. There needs to be an item lock feature, or ""secure chest"" you can put those items in so they cant be sold. Like Shovels and Fishing rods, etc.All in all, hunger and money run the game and if you can master them, the game is pretty much done with. ;)Fun though.			"

												This game was released a tad bit too early. The idea and premise are fun and the game has its moments but they are quickly forgotten in the face of glaring bugs, spelling errors, and unpolished gameplay. The path finding and task mangement in the game are atrocious and are in need of some serious work. I wouldn't recommend buying this game until those issues are addressed. For example, I watched a ship drink and♥♥♥♥♥♥itself into mutiny while half of the crew were cleaners. Those cleaners did nothing while the bottles and poop just piled up, reducing morale, and  eventually dooming the ship. It was very frustrating to watch an otherwise successful pirate ship fail because the cleaners of the ship were about as effiecient as an upsidedown Roomba. I expect this game to be much better in a few more patches.			"

Anywho overall this game is pretty good even only 3 hours in. Also Just a warning to turn down your volume while playing this, as the people yelling gets kinda of annoying. I would suggest just listening to music or something instead of having your game volume up. I will add more to this after I complete the game. "

 Pixel Piracy Pixel Piracy is a roguelike 'management' game where you build a crew and ship in order to defeat the four legendary pirates. It\'s a simple concept, however the game is built upon leveling your crew and building up your ship, while managing, morale, hunger, gold. There has been controversy, due to it having large gaps between updates, leading to it being called a 'typical Early Access game'. This, however, is not the case anymore, bugs are uncommon, and the game is a fully fledged title. While the coming Cons list is longer than the Pros, it is merely due to the large number of small complaints, over a fewer number of big pros. Pros +Easy to get into+Stylized+Gameplay is entertaining+Creativity is nurtured, through stat growth and ship customization+Character names and other small jokes are funny (MINOR) Cons -Lack of options in ingame menus-Little depth in music and sound effects-Bugs are uncommon, but relevant-Interface is almost an issue, sort of weird to use-Typos are somewhat common Conclusion Pixel Piracy has grown from its original Early Access childhood into a mature game with fleshed out features, alongside some minor issues. I recommend the title if you enjoy other games like, FTL: Faster Than Light.			"

Early Access Review
								Before buying this game, please be aware that crapping is a major game mechanic. Your little pixel pirates poop like they're toddlers hopped up on raisin bran.If you ever had the urge to see Captain Jack Sparrow take a dump while in mid-duel, this is the game for you. But if you're looking to play a fun game with pirates, rather than babysitting a bunch of toddlers after all-you-can-eat fiber day, you may want to reconsider this purchase.Seriously. No kidding. The pirates crap everywhere, all the time. There are in-game diapers and toilet training manuals. If this kind of humor isn't funny to you, you really won't enjoy this game.			"

												Edit again:So now the big patch that has been promised for so long is finally out. I think.See, I'm not going to play it. I do have a reason for this, but you should no longer trust this review implicitly because maybe my reason is unfounded.See, I read the statements made by the below mentioned producer in several posts made before this release. Here's what it boiled down to for me:We couldn't fix this, so instead you should just play differently. We couldn't make multiple decks work because we hard coded the game poorly, so you should just not build multiple decks, but here's a micromanagement tool for you to use so your guys don't starve to death anymore. Ignore the fact that this isn't actually really any different from the previous way of assigning work, and please pay attention to the fact it's on a new menu.I mean seriously. What kind of shoddy solution is that? Maybe I'm misreading everything this guy is saying, but when a dev is willing to admit over and over that his mostly abandonded game that wasn't close to finshed on release doesn't function well and CAN'T BE MADE TO FUNCTION AS INTENDED EVER, PERIOD, it's kind of a sign that I wasted my money on it.Or, from the release notes itself:""Added rudimentary MOD SUPPORT (some game data is now loaded from xml files and can be overwritten in the new Mods folder, don't ask us how to do it, we don't know!) ""Not a shock.Perhaps I'm just mad and frustrated with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs who run with my money, and even more so with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs who can do so while seeming like good guys because they are being ""honest"" and ""transparent"" about what they are doing. Like I say, you should read some other reviews too. But seriously....Edit: Having now put 30 hours into this, and having played several more patches, I still firmly stand beside what I have to say below. This is not a finished product, and the devs have now started work on another game. They claim this is a seperate team, but they also claim that only one person was really working on this game as kind of a hobby, and he is on that team. Which sort of makes me scratch my head and wonder who's still working on this game if it's not any of the people involved with it. I will admit that the game is slightly less broken than it was on release (though the above mentioned producer has no issue admitting it's still a buggy, barely functioning mess in his latest press release, which seems to have now been deleted :s), but I personally think most consumers expect the basic mechanics of a game to work after Alpha, not barely work half a year after full release.I feel my original review was fairly impartial and made other buyers aware of potential issues. Now I simply want to scream DONT BUY THIS CRAP. Blah.Original review:I have such mixed feelings on this game.On one hand, I did throughly enjoy the 7 or so hours of gameplay I put into it before I had no choice but to fight pirates armed with cannons. There were a few little bugs here and there, but all in all the game does manage to have that ""adventure"" type feeling I just don't get from many games that promise it. Managing your crew doesn't devolve into ridiculous, time consuming mircomanagement (unless you want it to), there are enough items and skills and powerups to give it a decent RPGish type feeling, and most of the gameplay itself (beyond some of the ""sail for six minutes while nothing happens"" travelling moments) is pretty fun.On the other hand, by the time those seven hours were up, most of foes I had to face were pretty easy to defeat, except those with the cannons. Who are so game breakingly annoying to defeat that i don't think I'll end up playing this again.It's not a matter of things becoming to hard, it's a matter of them becoming pointless. Yes, I can sink the opposing ship with my own cannons, but then not only do I not feel very piratey (cause, you know, plunder and all), I end up wasting enough ammo and taking enough damage that it's financially impratical to bother trying. And yes, I can still board enemies to capture them, but for whatever reason, the devs have decided to make it so that whenever you attack a pirate holding a cannon ball (which seems to count for at least 2-3 of the enemy's crew), they explode. Even if this doesn't sink the enemy ship with your guys on it, they will envariably kill a few of them, which means I can either maintain a massive crew of low-level guys to use as fodder (once again costing far more than I'll make off of looting), or I can risk losing some of my skilled crew (which is not only yet again not nearly covered financially by my gains, but kind of a massive pain in the♥♥♥♥♥having spent hours building them to the point that I want them at).Heaven forbid some dudes holding cannonballs should get on your ship.The other issue with cannons themselves is they make ship design less interesting. A borg cube suddenly becomes king of the waves because even though it can be damaged to the point where the battle was not worth it in terms of gold, it won't sink like a pretty Spanish galleon will when some dude gets stabbed while holding a cannonball on the lowest deck.So, it's not a matter of things getting too hard - provided no one suicide bombs me, they are arguably a little too easy if anything. I just really dislike that after a certain point in the gameplay, everything I do begins to act as a step backwards. There is no point in proceeding if there are no gains.I'd probably not be too concerned if this was an early access game, or if I could find a mod to make pirates stop suicide bombing themselves. As it is, I believe this is the full release (though I'll have to double check after writing this), and no one seems to have cooked up a fix for my major issue.It also doesn't help that despite being a full release, most of the actual gameplay mechanics just don't work. I don't just mean the cannons. sometimes your dudes will just decide to path into the ocean, killing themselves, and should you add a second deck to your ship, you can count on everyone starving to death because they can't find the food on the deck below them.Buy it if you're a casual gamer or if you die often in these types of games and will rarely get to the point described above. Don't buy it if you like games that give you some sense of accomplishment, cause after a while, you will just get frustrated.			"

 Take part in the biggest hide and seek game. Now don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the START of the game but if you want an actual decent amount of pirates and a big boat you cannot unless you don't mind 5 FPS? This isn't a spec problem the game has memory loss somewhere that causes this. Now to get into this review Like I said the start is really good, Game is smooth, addictive and has a pretty big map. The game also has many types of ships to take for yourself or plunder for loot, from vikings to imperials and another crew who im guessing are stormcloaks :P also other pirates. Plenty of weapons and the choice to make your own ship (which i never did because, pfft I'm a pirate!) Also recruit your own crew from Tavern round the map. Now with all that good stuff on display, Bombs will be dropped here. So the game gives you 35 open spaces for your crew members, which you can fill but any battles/towns you end up in, say bye to your frames because their gone. The games screen transitions are extremely long which wouldn't really bother me but you have to sit through two of them everytime you sail to a place which becomes real tedious. Selling anything to stores isn't worth the time as it has a 2 second lag for every item you sell, which also don't stack. Final Conclusion The game isn't worth buying for full price but if you get it in a bundle it sure is worth a go. I should also mentioned that this game is no longer in early access and the dev has already announced he's working on his next game, so I can't see these problems being fixed. If your still considering it, I'd say keep your crew number about 12 so its still playable. Personal Quote ""Play Black Flag""I don't want to leave a long review but hopefully this was informative enough for anyone considering buying the game.Please let me know what you think of the review (like/dislike) comment some constructive advice for me. Til next time see ya'll! Edit There was an update claiming to improve the framerate, Note it still runs like a scurvy riddled pirate.			"

												Its a great game, BUT there are a ton of bugs with it and the most notable one being that once your ship gets big enough and you have a ton of crew hands, the whole game gets really laggy and slow. The performance of it all just drops by about 80%. Hopefully this gets fixed in the near future. If it does, will change my thumbs down to a thumbs up.			"

												I'd like to give this game a recommendation, I really would. The mechanics are fun and interesting. I love combat and building my own ship designs.The one thing that stops me from recommending this game is that the game has horrible optimization issues. My computer isn't exactly bleeding edge, but I'm able to play most modern games quite smoothly at high settings. However, in Pixel Piracy just having a moderately large confrontation between ships slows the game down to a crawl. Because of this, I can't stand to continue past a certain point in the game because the performance just utterly goes in the toilet, we're talking ~5 FPS.			"

												The game seems fun at first but it starts to drag on after a few encounters. Ever encounter feels the same with slight changes such as the enemy ship having cannons or the crew/islanders having new weapons.As others have stated, pathing is an issue. Your crew will wander about your ship will there are things to do and never use them. If you ship is dirty and one of your crew members has the cleaning skill, they might just walk right past a mess and let it hurt your crew morale.			"

												Game Score: 6/10Replay Value: 3/10Price vs Game Content: Price is rather expensive for what is being offeredOverall Score: 4/10Recommended: NoTL;DR Review:Unless you have bought this game on a sale, this isn't worth the money. Sure the game is fun to play at the start, and looks fantastic in the trailers and gameplay shots, but once you're halfway in you will find bugs everywhere and all sorts of unbalanced gameplay aspects that make it nearly unplayable, even on the LOWEST DIFFICULTY. Replay value in this game is also very small. Don't buy it for the full price, it's NOT worth it.Detailed Review:Pixel Piracy is a very appealing game in the sense that this may be one of the only games where you get to manage your own pirate life and crew. It has very charming graphics, a rather unique style of gameplay and very entertaining comedic aspects. As well as this, the gameplay is rather solid, playable and fun.That is, until about halfway through the game.This game definitely needs to be worked on, since there are bugs galore, the game becomes very unbalanced (particularly due to the concept of MORALE), and it generally just becomes frustrating. I chose to play this game in the easiest game mode, dubbed ""Sailor Mode"". This is simply because I wanted to explore the gameplay aspects and obtain all of the achievements this game has to offer first, before I began challenging myself. However, even in this game mode I found that the game eventually got to an unplayable state due to the tedious sailing required just to keep my crew members happy.I would probably recommend this game to just about anyone if the game was balanced and saved from the frustrating bugs that dominate every last corner, but otherwise this just needs to be worked on.But from what it looks like, I don't think that will be happening, considering that the developers have invested all of their interests into 'Pixel Privateers'.All other aspects of this game are perfect. It is just these very annoying things that make this game literally 'sink'.			"

												Type of Game:RPG Pirate Simulation with heavy PDL (Procedural Death Labyrinth) elementsVersion Played:PC version through SteamSimilar Games:A mixture of Sid Meier’s Pirates!, Rogue Legacy, and to a lesser degree TerrariaThe Good:The pirate-themed survival aspect is riveting and keeps the player motivated to continue, much like the a fore-mentioned Sid Meier’s Pirates!The light level of beginning customization is a welcome addition and can lend to the player’s attachment to his doomed pirateProper planning is key to survival, which creates an enjoyable experience around the idea of trial and errorLearning all the different skills and items is fun in its own right, but also a necessary means of progressionProcedurally generated maps/islands that feature random enemies, loot, vendors, and interactive itemsLevel progression is deep and really appeals to those who love to ponder statistical advantages (i.e. “Do I use this skill book on this pirate and then boost his health amount or just massively boost this pirate’s attack?”)Collecting a crew and assigning them tasks is enjoyableBuilding and upgrading your ship is intuitive and builds upon ideas already done by games like TerrariaThe permadeath feature adds a fun sense of urgency and stresses the importance of preparation and planningThe Bad:Bugs are still an issue, but the developers are consistently pushing out updates that correct the high priority onesThe animations are pretty minimal and don’t really help in the immersion department (think early South Park)Sound design is also basic, but the island tunes reminded me of the first Secret of Monkey Island game so there is that!A more comprehensive tutorial would benefit the player’s early moments in the gameCan you play it while the children are awake?:Sure. Most of the graphics and animations are pixelated, which covers up most of the violence. My children enjoyed hearing the pooping noises the pirates made after eating.Did I make time to complete it?This appears to be a game that doesn’t have a definitive ending (though I may be wrong). I played numerous pirates and “survived” for quite a long time with some of them. The playthroughs were all enjoyable regardless of their length.Redlight or Greenlight?This game is currently at a greenlight.To be honest I’ve played some “completed” games that haven’t been this polished or fun. While the game has its bugs, the gameplay completely out weighs them. As a fan of the PDL genre, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.More Reviews @ A Glance at http://www.gamersglance.com "

												This game is riddled with game-breaking bugs and poorly implemented features.- Crews don't go where they're told- Even on Easy, it is excruciatingly difficult to get a companion to level up with you because they die so fast. Well, if you thought you could keep them out of combat, (1) they don't listen, (2) they don't share XP from kills from your more seasoned fighters.- Morale is broken- UI is broken: if I want to eat food, I have to go to the ""Shipbuilding"" panel... if I want to give my crew a consumable, I have to select them in the crew tab and ""equip"" a ""passive item"". You can't even go to a screen where all of your items are visable at once, which leaves you guessing...- Poorly implemented tutorial. The fact that you can't pause and view the tutorial properly at the same time tells you all you need to know about this problem.- Poor translation- No officially sanctioned community or bug reporting- You can't save the game at your convenience, even on the non-hardcore setting. This wouldn't be so upsetting if the game didn't have so many game-ending/breaking bugs/features. I'm currently stuck on a save where my Captain has 3 health and is bleeding; aka I die immediately after loading.This could have been a great game. The developers jumped the gun by releasing this as a completed product (""1.0"") so soon. Hope they find a way to make things better.			"

												I'm rather torn on this game.  For the most part I had a lot of fun with it, it's rather simple, and is a easy game to play during boring lectures.  It a fun level grind, with the potential to invest heavy in some crew members and/or make some expendable.  The mechanics are fairly simple once you get the hang of things.  That being said, I would advise playing the game muted, or at the very least turn off the character voices.  In a way they're all like pokemon and only have one line which they repeat over and over again in some incredibly annoying voices.  Despite all this, the main reason I can't recommend this game is the fact that you can't finish it.  I mean you could if you were down to restart every 3 battles, but I'm really not into that.  I read the reviews on memory leaks and I thought ""nah it'll be fine"" .  It wasn't.  After investing a few hours into what seemed to be a really great game, I came to the realization I wouldn't get to complete it.  It's a great time waster, but you could easily find something just as fun and for free, or at least cheaper, in flash games.  Like most of the other reviews I would only recommend this if it were on sale for under $5, that alone doesn't get it a thumbs up though.EDIT: Upon further review, it would seem the developers still care about the game and community and are still trying to patch things to help with the lag and other features.  While I wouldn't say the game has been fixed by any rate, I do appreciate developers that don't give up their product.  That, along with the hope that one day the memory leak issues will be fixed, is reason I am changing my recommendation to a thumbs up for this game.			"

												Okay since im only seeing Negative reviews for this game (atleast the recent ones) let me clear things up for you guys.TL;DR -> Hired a new Pirate - had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ perk -> ship full of♥♥♥♥♥♥->pirate with cleaning perk throws♥♥♥♥♥♥at enemy pirate -> knocks him off -> enemy drowns.10/10 would play again.Game is NOT abandoned. Devs are working on the EN-han-ced patch series right now which already brought ALOT new stuff to the game. There's more areas , more encounters , more YARRRR.The games idea doesn't only look good on the paper. It plays good aswell. People that say that the NPC behavior is stupid sometimes most likely have stupid mates on their ship (these tend to ignore your commands from time to time).Each of your hired Pirates will have a different personality. Some might bully your other pirates which result in pirates getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and becomming hostile.Some are eating a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of food, some are lazy and slack when you're not looking and some♥♥♥♥♥♥all over your boat like crazy (seriously it's insane.) and more and more and more. There are so many different types of Pirates you can hire for your adventure. Alot of different weapons and Skills you can teach/equip every single pirate with.Game starts out slowly but will get you hooked quite quickly (beginners especialy those who didn't play this type of game before might have a hard time in their first try but will get a hang of the game quite fast(if not check a beginners guide on the games official wiki))this game has great potential and is already at a very good state. 9,99 might be a bit expensive and those of you who are not quite sure if they like the game or not should just wait for a sale or look for the game at sites like humblebundle to get a little discout (although the devs realy deserve the money) (8/10) "

												So while i give this title a big ""Plunder immediately and cast-off me hearty!"" I have to make you aware of a couple of performance issues that I am having. Here are my primary computer specs:Windows 7 64bitVisheara 8 core 8350 AMD16gb low latency gamer ramGeforce 970 gtx144hz Dell S2716DG Monitor900 watt black edition HE power supplyCrosshair formula IV motherboard With this strong machine I still experience game stopping stuttering and lag after about an hour of play. Shutting the game down and turning it back on seems to work for another stretch of time, but it varies as to when the problem will occur again and it will. This leads me to suspect some sort of memory leak but beyond that I can't speculate. Aside from this unfortunate performace issue, Pixel Piracy is an excellent time killer in which you can sail the high seas, experience elements of survival as you must fend off pirates, eat, drink, and maintain morale lest you suffer from a scurvy dog mutiny...The goal is to sail and plunder as much gold as possible while becoming stronger and propagating your small crack force of pirate boarders who will hopefully become powerful enough to face off against the powerful legendary pirates. Youll only achieve this with the right weaponry and tactics after fighting many battles. Good luck Captains! Yo ho, a pirates life for thee			"

												Pixel Piracy falls on that line between adorable and brutal. The animation is fun and inviting, and then everything bleeds. The pirates, animals, crates, urns, it's great. The micromanagement of every character makes it that much more fun. I have put a lot more time into this than expected. Wouldn't mind being able to customize the crew appearanc, but finding the cool looking crew members is part of the fun. And having a goofy unibrow guy carry the bomb to blow up when he dies is pretty entertaining too.			"

												This is a very good game, it is broken at the moment though. My ship is a cross between floating biome and pub poker tournament, with cards, rum and plants all over. All my pirates, ALL of them know cleaning and toilet study (or wear diapers) but this doesn't help. Not at all. Pirates after doing a few poop scoops will forget they clean or simply not bother, but they don't mind dumping on the boat, that they still remember. The game either needs a mechanic to sort out morale late game, or to fix cleaning, because cleaning breaks often. My ship just turns into a mutiny. Cheating is a must to clean the ship when you own 20+ pirates and a big ship.			"

												At the moment, this game is empty or so repetitive (that's the same thing), it's fun on first game/hour because you discover mechanics after that it's boring and too easy.Some guys said on [+] that you can build your own ship, it's true but so useless, you can even build an Entreprise or Xwings that did not even touch the water, and it works, no gravity for ship's blocks, you can have hole in the hull, the boat still floats. You have to build enough of sail, canon, etc (each with a limit number), a small pathway/labyrinth helps you when ennemy boarding you but tha'ts all, useful possibilities are so thin.For the good humor, i'm agree for pirate's humor, but poop, Diapers and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children are also here... so it spoils the overall atmosphere.What can i add to this ?, hmmm not enough different weapons, terrible user interface (thought with feet, not brain), no real quests even randomly generated, just you find a treasure map and you have to go on the cross on map ( another isle), or just kill a man on another isle.So an easy game for a child laughing with poo, casual, empty and boring. It worth less than 1 buck.EDIT 2015-07-23 : with latest patch : HUGE MEMORY LEAKS, its laggy with 10 pirates on my side and same against me, buggy wheelmouse to switch between crew member (when some animals are tamed) ...

I can literally Raid a medium ship with just my pets all together.Not a bad game though. If you like Micromanaging Your Crew. And Your Captain. Then This is the game.A lot of items are expensive at first, but Once you raid some 7 ships and Plunder them. You get materials to sell and Gold.But dont Forget To Pay your Members Or Else they will attemp to kill you.Very fun. Not alot of Replayability since it feels a little Repatative after a while.Sail, Plunder, Sail, Plunder, Sail, Plunder, Sell All your Stuff, Buy food and Guns, Sail, Plunder. Its a endless Rinse And repeat after you gather a large Crew And Have A really Big Ship.Still fun though!6/10			"

								This is a great, albeit slightly 'broken', game! It definitely has great potential, and considering it is still in alpha, has met this potential masterfully. The gameplay is fun and immersive and, despite not having played too much myself, I have found myself absorbed in this game (almost to the point where I would cry if any of my crew died). I highly reccomend that you pick up this game if you are willing to put up with the few bugs or odd happenings that are still occuring (since it is still in development) and it is well worth the money if you like these 'hardcore' or 'roguelike' games.

												Right now the game is only 3.49 becasue of a sale and it provides at least 3 hours of fun without becoming tedious. About half the people who buy the game dont like it and only spend enough time to beat one legendary pirate lord and think ""screw this Im not going to spend the time to travel around the map and get the other 3"".  But other people like the game and will replay the game to beat legendary mode. [but they probably will not spend 132 hours on it like me]. The point is the game is worth 3 bucks, even if you dont like it there is enough new things in the beggining to make the game worth it.7/10 It still warms my heart to see a ship shapted like a shoe "

Isn't that enough to buy it?Oh, wait, your crew also has phrases like ""Where is our friendship going, mate?"" and ""Do you even ARRRRRR?"". Already a 20/10, but wait, there's more.You can blow up an enemy's ship to celebrate your victory, or take it and leave your old piece of poop built of 5 poo...wood blocks. Damn!Would reccomend it to waste time. If you're looking for some tactical-strategical crap, like DotA, Starcraft or whatever, you came to the wrong island, Horke!And don't forget to add ""THE POOPLORD"" to your hero's name, it'll give you the feeling of the pirate's atmosphere			"

												Pirates Log, Day 1:I love the game, I love the graphics. I think the idea is extremely fun, and the game is challenging, yet not so intense that I feel like I actively being involved. I love the freedom to build a ship, sail the sea, kill a bunch of stuff, get a sword and be powerful, and yet get caught off guard and lose everything. Also the fact that I can have crabs (sea crabs) that can come into battle with me makes me happy.Some down sides:-The voice lines are overplayed and sometimes annoying. I turned them almost all the way off because I couldn't take the ""save the rum"" line. -Also occasionally you will have a pirate glitch and not be able to grapple to the ship and they drown. It only happened to one of my captains this time, so it wasn't awful, but it can get annoying. 7/10 would reccomend this game to a friend, I look forward to continuing the quest.  Will update the review (or add a new one) depending on how the boss battles go. "

												I REALLY REALLY WANT to like this game but no. Just no. This game. This game is RIDICULOUSLY bugged. I've had this game since it was released on steam. The concept is great, the art is gorgeous, but the bugs ruin every aspect that is the least bit enjoyable. This game is FAR from being a real non-early access 1.0 game. It just wasn't and still isn't ready...As of this comment, this worst bugs are:1. pirates attack random enemies, not the ones closest to them (even though this was ""fixed"" in the recent update)2. moral. wow moral. I have the game set to ""easy"" (where moral only decreases at 40% of ""original"" speed) yet every crew member needs to be payed literally every 5 minutes. The average crew member needs to be payed about 100 gold every time he is angry. If you try-hard, you can get about 200-400 gold per 5 minutes. Lets see here... lets say you have 10 crew members. Now you defaulty need about 1000 gold every 5 minutes JUST FOR PAYING THEM TO KEEP THEIR MORALS UP, but there is literally no way to make that much money in that time frame. The game is unbeatable. Your sailors will become too greedy because you are making them rich but not as rich as they want so they will start to try and kill each other and you. good luck with that.3. i've got a decent if not good computer... and i still lag, especially during ship encounters with difficulty over 5 (the ships are starting to get pretty large) and i have no idea why since, you know, THIS IS A PIXEL ART GAME.4. Food. Don't even get me started there. I finally progressed far enough so that i have several fisherman and cooks to keep cooking fish to keep everyone fed. Before that, I had to try-hard for gold and then spend literally 80-90% of it just buying food from a town to keep everyone from starving to death. New players beware: if your pirates don't kill each other because they aren't the richest of the sea first, then they will surely starve to death.5. Not exactly a bug, but for $15 this game needs to last longer. I'm assuming that if there were no bugs and the game mechanics were actually balanced, from the current state, you could beat the game in like under 5 hours, even if it is your first time playing. tl;dr: this game is PRE-early access material. It is only proof of concept. The bugs could be acceptable for an ""out-of-early-access"" stage, but c'mon... the game mechanics are not even close to being balanced enough for an average gamer to enjoy the experience.			"

												I bought this game and played it a bunch a couple of yeard ago or whatever but ditched it promising myself I'll just start playing again whenever it's been cleared up of bugs and expanded a bit. According to all these steam reviews the developers never did that and just grabbed a bunch of money.♥♥♥♥ you developers.			"

												Ultra annoying. Pretty much everything that should be balanced isn't. There are bugs (crew members randomly dying, situations in which you can't continue the game without loading the save, ui problems). Add to that a bunch of random ideas that don't really fit together, lack of things to do (except fighting the same two ships/islands over and over) and general randomness of your progress.It sucks big time, go play FTL instead.

								               Really, the screenshots don't do this game justice. It's not what I expected at all (even after reading about it a little and watching the trailer) but I was pleasantly surprised. The only reason I bought this was because it was made by Re Logic, creators of Terraria (as well as another group I haven't heard of and forgot the name of) and I had a 25% off coupon (2 in fact). I was immediately taken by the menu screen's music and small visuals in the backdrop of palm trees swaying at an angle. I created my world and was off.              Moving was confusing at first because I assumed W-A-S-D would work but instead I had to click. I caught on quickly and bought crew members and food (and accidently attacked shopkeeper). Then I made my ship, had to watch a video to learn how to sail, and began my grand adventure.              Well, that particular exploration was a bust, because I saved when docking at a town with my captain at 3% morale and did not have the funds to pay him, so he kept losing morale and the game was over when it was out. This part may seem confusing now, but you will soon learn what this all means when you take the first step into the world.......Ready for adventure?			"

												This game is somewhere in between meh and allright.PROS >>> The crew management and skill building is nice. By endgame your crew really feels like your, customizable band of thugs>>> There is a lot of wit and humor put into this game. Something pretty entertaining considering overall lack of interesting visuals.>>> The combat is... unique. blowing up and looting ships is fun and overall pretty satisfying.THE SHIPLOAD OF CONS *puns*>>> after defeating the first of the four pirates, there is really no need to kill the rest, because they do not get any more difficult and are prettty much the same.>>> eventually it gets boring and repetitive. >>> Shipbuilding is supposed to be a major part of the game. i never once did it because i just found better ships. a better way to implament Shipbuilding would be, insstead of stealing ships, just take some of the building components and add them to your own vessel.>>> Falling down a similar path as Shipbuilding, taming pets is pretty unescesary because anything a common crab or turtle can do a crewman can do better. pluss, it takes a crewmans weapon slot for an animal cage, and the good, powerful animals are way to hard to tame.>>>All of the towns are the same, except for the items it sells. same with the islands, which are wasted except for buried treasure.>>> There are no custom npc's with actual stories. The names, outfits, starting skills and stats, and story are randomized for ALL of the npcs. this would be okay if not all npcs were like this. (you can only find pirates that are godd at fighting at pirate cities for example.) The npcs are extremely repetitive.thats all i feel like listing. a TEN BILLION TIMES BETTER pirate simulator is SID MEYERS PIRATES please go play that instead of this "

												Pixel Piracy first starts off as a good game as the sense of adventure and mystery awaits. However that feeling quickly fades away after the first couple of hours. The gameplay is very shallow - you go from location to location either fighting others on ships or on islands. Rinse and repeat until you farm up enough experience to take on higher levels and gold to purchase a larger crew and additional items. There are no quests or missions here, just a giant map open for you to wander aimlessly until you can defeat the 4 legendary pirates in each corner of the map. Not only does going from location to location and repeating the same commands gets boring very fast there are bugs that constantly come up (ex. crew members randomly decide not to get off the ship anymore). The game is fine if you're OK doing the same thing over and over and can deal with the game issues/bugs, but to me it's just not fun and quite boring. This game would actually be somewhat decent if it was a mobile type of game.			"

You lose all of your hard work (if you're not playing in pansy mode). You won't get an experience like this in any other game, and this game is really really fun.			"

												I have very mixed feelings about this game, at first it was very fun to play but later on it turned out it is quite repetitive and boring.For most part i thought  you can travel through islands and search for treasures, but sailing would be optional. I was wrong, most of the time you have to sail on ship. Game has three places at maximum which by the way causes to get boring quite fast. Island battles, ship boarding battles and visit other towns, all island are and will be same size does not matter where you travel. If you have hired more than 2 pirates you can not controll them separately only captain, all other crew members will be controlled with RMB. Ugly in game's interface, selecting any item from list will reset your list back to top, which is very annoying.Game fails to explain how many skills particular crew member can have, also some skills just stopped to level up for some reason, i dunno, if it is intended or bug.And last but not least, apperantly devs have abandoned Pixel Piracy for good, so there is no point to buy it, because lets face it game is not finished.For more info look at this review!

												Got this game for free by one of the devs as a gift, back in xmas when copies of the game were being thrown arround. I have spend 0€'s on this, and because of that, I feel bad for the people who actually bought it. I'll go with the bad stuff first:The biggest dissapointment is that the game is unfinished. This is something that I just can't tolerate. You don't sell someone a house without roof, so you should NOT sell an unfinished game. Does the game have the features that the devs promised? No weather system, no sea-monster battles, no hideouts, no bases,you don't get much with a 10€ purchase. You have islands where most of the NPC's (or all of them) are hostile, peaceful islands where you can buy stuff, and ship battles that are bland and repetitive. And that's another thing...Sea battles. They're horse-sh#t. Maybe at the start, they're somewhat okay, you just tell your guys to aboard a little ship, or they board yours... But then later on, they have cannons, you have cannons, and all the fun explodes. Crew members are expensive and take forever to train so they're useful (and training also takes money), but they die easily by the cannons. AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING TOO!You only have two commands to give: Either move the captain arround, or move everyone else. That's it. I'm not kidding. Mouse 1 selects a place where your captain can move, and Mouse 2 moves everyone else to that point. You can't, for example, tell someone to stay ready at the cannons, or to stay cooking for everyone else. Your pirates, captain included, will do whatever they feel like. This isn't Sims 2, this is a Pirate Simulator, and let me tell you, PIRATES WERE COORDINATED. If they weren't, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A CAPTAIN! I've also managed to find bugs. I mean, it's no surprise, I'm able to find bugs even on my house (the lightning works like sh#t, and the windows barely work, everyone smokes weed, 4/20), but I'm talking about bugs that force you to restart the game (being stuck on the enemy ship, even though you blew it up and can't go back), and even bugs that will force you to restart the game again! (crew members, captain included, suddenly refuse to eat, I managed to find out that boarding another ship and taking it for your own fixes it temporally) And I refuse to think that they haven't found any of these bugs yet. I found them in less than an hour of playing the game.That being said, does the game have good stuff? Yeah, there's a lot of potential for a great game, but sadly the Devs left the boat (ironic) to make other games. I remember that in December of 2013, they promised those features to be added. We're in 2015. It's been more than a whole year, and the only thing that was added have been Steam cards and achievements. Oh, and some XMas items. The characters look okay, the voices and soundtrack are decent, the gameplay can be dull at times, but it's fun for a few hours, the graphics are beautiful but lazy (you see the same stuff WAAAAAY too much), the character and world creating is creative, even though it doesn't seem to matter much in the end, there are some good references to other games and movies hidden arround there, though I expected more... And it goes on to infinity.I can't bring myself to recommend the game. I really want to, because I had fun for a while... But I can't even bring myself to finish it. Why? Because I know it's going to be the same, over again. I defeated one of the 4 ""Legendary Captains"" without much effort, and the other 3 will surely be the same. There's no story either, so why would I expect an ending? It's probably a screen with text, and maybe some credits. If they EVER finish the game, then I'll play it again, redo the review, and update it, maybe even recommend it. But for now? Spending 10€ on this is a ripoff. Maybe just wait for a sale that drops it arround 1-3€ if you're interested in helping the devs, that's it.			"

								Even though the game is in Alpha, it is a very entertaining. It has a  great mix of randomness, strategy, and sandbox features to provide hours of fun. The procedural generation of the game world keeps every new game fresh, and the rouge like nature of the game makes it challenging.You can customize your crew to be a misfit bunch of pirates who's come from all sorts of backgrounds to include A Mad God, Demon God, A space pirate or simple profession like Lawyer, banker, and tax collector. Or you can make one that strike fear into all foes by recruiting a rag tag group of assassins and other miscreants. Customize your pirate ship to be the devil of the seas, or be silly and creative to make it look like a your favorite animal. The choice is yours.Wathc my frist look video here

								There are a few things that would be greatly appreciated with this game, first a choice in appearance over mashing random till you are happy with the avatar presented, possibly some icons of what the crew members look like when hiring new people too. also, I had a barrel filled with meat but several crew members starved for some reason. Most of all it would be nice to be able to assign each command to a key (plunder, interact etc.) as clicking across the screen is a bit more fiddly with the setup I have and the UI presented. All in all though a good game when you get into it and with it being under £10 [from Sales/25% coupon] I find this game well worth the price.			"

								100% HOOKED! It's litterally the only game I've played in the past three days. It's uh... it's quite sad actually. Aside from that, I'll be honest: I didn't have high hopes for Pixel Piracy. It looked like Re-logic just repeated Terraria all over again, but with more of an RPG aspect this time. That was not the case. Sure the game is made of pixels, but if you look closely, it's a beautiful world that runs smoothly. You can hire your own crew, discover lost treasure, make your own ship (Look at my screenshots for examples) and so much more. Of course the game is still in alpha, but the game is already so amazing! I highly reccomend the game.			"

								This game is awesome, it is about both adventuring the lands while fighting enemies, and building the perfect boat in which to rule the pixel seas, I rate it about 9.5 out of 10 due to the difficulty, lack of achievements and also lack of steam trading cards, however, as it is only in alpha stage at the moment, these are minor things that could be fixed soon.

								Pixel Piracy is a roguelike, RPG game where you make a pirate, decide your own destiny and explore a ocean full of mystery and dangerous adventure. It's a fun 8-bit styled game that has pretty good replayability in it, as well as the option to play on Hardcore mode, or an Arena mode.You can level up and customize your own stats for each of your pirate crew members, as well as equipping ranged and melee weapons. (Passive too, mostly used for healing and little buffs.) The game itself is pretty simple once you understand the mechanics, build a ship, explore around islands or battle other pirates/people in other ships and build your own crew of pirates to commandeer.If I'd have to give any issues I have with it currently, it's that the voices in it can get annoying at times, from having to hear your pirate and crew randomly yell out gibberish, especially when you're in a tavern FILLED with other pirates. The graphic options could use more work too, so far it's just Unity launcher settings with a normal and normal/vsync option.Overall though, and being that it's in alpha currently, it's a pretty good buy if you're into roguelike games, and hopefully, they'll improve it much more as time goes on.

												All the negative reviews on this game are fairly outdated, the latest version of this game is incredible and it's so cheap it's insane that this game isn't out selling some of the other crap on early acess, The amount of exploration, high quality random generators and content in this game, my only complaint would be that the stats of items in shops are always wrong as they don't consider your pirate's stats.What you get with this game-Custom boat building terraria styleTons of items and weapons to equip to your piratesA fun combat system that's good if not still a tiny bit clunkySTATS sooo many statsA cool exploration game with a variety of scenarios although they are slightly limited in type (eg:Town, Island, Pirate)A skills system giving loads of decisions on how you are gonna specialise each pirateThe ability to make stupid pirate based puns by renaming your pirates "

												This game has so much going for it that I can't say what hasn't already been said. It may be buggy, it may be rough around the edges, however this title is worth the money. It is exactly what it claims to be: an open-world rogue-like survival-sandbox about pillagin' and plunderin'.You start with a ship and quickly find yourself fighting off pirates, native islanders, animals and even wandering boxes - all to earn gold so you can build a crew and upgrade your mighty swashbucklin' vessel with the best bits and bobs around. Through teaching your men various skills for combat, sailing, and housekeeping you can build a crew that'll make Davy Jones quake in his booties. Failing that, it makes for a great fisherman / janitor management sim.9/10 - will purchase for friends.			"

												After the updates Pixel Piracy has undergone the past several month's I can now highly recommend this game at the asking price of $9.99. However, it still has a lot of work to undergo but at least the development team went back to this project to bring it up to par with the goals and standards they set out for in the beginning. You play as a pirate of your creation on a quest to kill four legendary pirates. It has a big map, a ship-creation tool, a bounty board, and an array of enemies and little details lacking in prior versions. Not for everyone but if you enjoy pixel graphics and being a pirate, this game is for you! So help support this three-man team and get this game because it is still better than other games like Godus and Castle Story; which have been completely abandoned, so disregard any review older than 2015 on this game if you want a more complete view of what this game will accomplish.

												Fun at first but quickly turn into a repetitive, imbalanced, very glitchy grind.  The damn thing is supposed to be out of early access and yet, it is one of the most unpolished games I've ever played. Also, the store page is missleading at best.  A game will take you about 10 hours to get through, and by the end it is a mindless grind.  Screw the claim of multiple full game playthroughs, you'd probably die of bordem.  The so-called 'open world' is only mildly accurate as it is just a collection of the same three things over and over (island encounters, ship encounters, and stores).  Also, the idea of having a large crew is completly absurd with the current hunger and morale system.  On the easiest difficulty, it is nigh impossible to support a crew of more than 5.  Actually, this game really is one broken system after another.			"

												First of all, this is after the big update. The fun is really funny for the first 7 - 8 hours, but when you get far into the game the only thing you do is going back to a tavern because if you dont do your crew will mostly die. but if you have the money to spend 10 euros to play for about 8 hrs buy it.

												A satisfying RPG, without a lot of depth, but still very fun. Pros: -sandbox game (design your own ship!) with tons of materials to be had.  -tons of stuff and updates still coming -a cool aesthetic, especially the backround -can be played one handed (very nice for early morning relaxation with some tea in one hand!) Cons: -I really can't think of anything! Examples of the Awesome: Building a massive 10-story ship with over 20 cannons.Score: 8/10			"

Early Access Review
								Reasons why pixel piracy is one of the first inde games you should buy on steam:Let's start on this game's high point, this game is GORGEOUS, it does a great job of making a pixellated game stunning, and it sets a new standard for pixel games. I'm only 3.7 hours into the game so far, and I still have so much more to do. This inde game has LOADS of content for it's price. The game, however, is extremely difficult for begginers. I tried to play on normal, but I couldn't so I reset to easy. In easy mode, it still is possible to lose if you haven't developped any strategies. I reccomend buying the cleaning trait, the fishing trait and cooking trait early on in the game, and not focusing too much on hiring. Oh yeah, and if you have a lot of pirates, they talk way too much and it gets annoying.There are so many aspects in this game, and it is extremely fun to try and balance all of it's challenges at once. I highly reccomend this game for people who like a challenge, like rogue-like games, task based games, or just don't have a good enough computer to buy expensive games. - Takes a while to get the hang of it-  Frustrating moments-Annoying pirates+Pirates can be cute ;)+ Great action and adventure+Beautifull game+It's a challenge+Extremely fun once you get the hang of it.+Lots of content+Cheap priceIt's not the best game ever, but I am having TONS of fun, so I'll give it a 9/10*Try to get this game on sale for extreme satisfaction!!

												I feel the trailer is completely misleading as to what the game is actually like. It shows what seems like open ended, tile-by-tile modular ship building, and then artillery gameplay similar to Worms between these ships, with a hint of Dwarf Fortress thrown in for good measure. I was instantly won over. The reality is, while there is tile-by-tile ship building, it's in practice purely cosmetical. It doesn't affect gameplay in any way. In fact, there is no strategy or tactics to speak of regarding much of anything you do in Pixel Pirates. It goes like this: 1 - You select an ""encounter"" on the map - whose ""level"" is conveniently visible to you. 2 - Your pirates sail to it and then go over and whack the hopelessly outmatched occupants of the ship/island/whatever. And if they aren't hopelessly outmatched, there isn't anything you can do to turn the tides either, the only orders you can give are to either fight or retreat; go select lower encounters instead.3 - If your pirates leveled up, decide which attribute to raise. Doesn't make much of a difference, just accept that they now can whack tougher stuff4 - If food is low, restock5 - If there's excess cash, buy more pirates so you can whack tougher stuff5 - Rinse and repeat.There's no depth whatsoever to anything. Promises of procedural generation? Well, it's procedurally generated in the same sense that Minefield for Windows is procedurally generated. Nothing interesting ever happens. Nothing actually requiring your input ever happens.			"

												New Review:It is sad to see how far this game has come in terms of being a steaming pile of poo. While minor tweaks have been made to the games user interface, the majority of work has been put towards useless graphics filters like bloom and depth of field (seriously guys?). The code in this game is so bad that even with all of the fancy graphics options turned off my GPU's fans start whirring at full speed and my computer sounds like it's going to reach five million degrees and create a black hole in the universe. Performance on this game is TERRIBLE. The user interface is still mind boggling terrible, and the game balance has actually gotten WORSE over time. With each iteration it becomes less and less of a survival game, and more and more of.... I don't even know what to call it. Where as I used to recommend this game in my old review, I am no longer recommending it. This is the first time I think I've ever seen a game actually get worse over time. It used to be worth a few bucks while on sale, but I can no longer say that about pixel piracy in its current state. It's hard to pinpoint the exact reasons why, but where I used to see innovation and potential, now I see bandaids and sideshows. Old Review:Despite its (serious) flaws, it's still not a bad buy.This game has incredible potential but is rendered nearly unplayable by bugs and ""features"". The UI is poorly done and controls very clunky. There is a very long list of these bugs on the steam forums. What follows is what I shared on the steam forums, but wraps up my sentiment on this game nicely.This game is so awesome, but is too buggy to actually play it throughConsistently, every single time, SOMETHING wigs out that causes something to happen that results in me needing to start a new game. One of them (bleeding to death) is a feature that kinda puts icing on the cake. Biggest culprit for me is pathfinding but it is not listed in the stickied post. Towards mid game when you need a larger ship to shield from cannon fire, pathfinding on the ship starts wigging out hardcore. People start floating over rum, getting off ladders at the wrong places, and it gets progressively worse till everyone (including the captain) is stuck. The other thing that gets me that I didn't see listed is that there is no way to prioritize tasks. My Captain prioritized fixing the hull while at port of an island OVER EATING and starved to death as I was powerless to do anything. Trying to sail away from the island was no good because he'd just starve before I got him to a tavern. Like, this game is awesome. Seriously. But it's unbalanced and so buggy. When I first bought it I do not remember seeing a preview version warning or anything like other green light games? Such a work of art mired down by bugs!			"

								Pixel Piracy is an amazing game. Published by the makers of Terraria, it is a fun way to burn hours of your life. The sandbox aspects mean that there is always the ability to do what you like whenever you like, and the shipbuilding is always something to look forward to. A few bugs here and there, which is to be excpected of a game in alpha, but this does not subract from the ratings. Customization currently warrants more options but overall this game is a great buy, and if anyone is considering purchasing this game, then BUY BUY BUY (Especially if you have the 25% off coupon like I do :D)!

								Pixel Piracy is a roguelike, RPG game where you make a pirate, decide your own destiny and explore a ocean full of mystery and dangerous adventure. It's a fun 8-bit styled game that has pretty good replayability in it, as well as the option to play on Hardcore mode, or an Arena mode.You can level up and customize your own stats for each of your pirate crew members, as well as equipping ranged and melee weapons. (Passive too, mostly used for healing and little buffs.) The game itself is pretty simple once you understand the mechanics, build a ship, explore around islands or battle other pirates/people in other ships and build your own crew of pirates to commandeer.If I'd have to give any issues I have with it currently, it's that the voices in it can get annoying at times, from having to hear your pirate and crew randomly yell out gibberish, especially when you're in a tavern FILLED with other pirates. The graphic options could use more work too, so far it's just Unity launcher settings with a normal and normal/vsync option.Overall though, and being that it's in alpha currently, it's a pretty good buy if you're into roguelike games, and hopefully, they'll improve it much more as time goes on.

												Has the idea of a finished game been forgotten? I bought this game on a whim during the 'full release' sale. Reading reviews it seemed like all the top were positive, calling it the 'pirate FTL,' but even with the short time I've put into it, it fails at capturing that. It feels like a beta, and I believe it still should be considered a beta. Interesting how a couple days after release now all the top reviews for it are negative. It honestly feels like a big flash game from some free game website thanks to the amateurish level of polish when it comes to the menus and fonts. I realize I haven't put much time into the game, but at this point I don't care to put any more. Perhaps in a few months with some big updates the game will be worth playing to me, but right now it isn't. I will still be waiting for it to be the 'pirate FTL.'			"

												Allright first, this is NOT a bad game in terms of potential, design, and replayability. It IS however horribly buggy, and frustrating when you realise this is no longer in early release. Those looking for a finished game, should wait. This game at it's best can be qutie a bit of fun managing your team and sailing the seven seas, however with the lack of control the player has over prioritys your team will quickly devolve into grabbing a chunk of Sh*t while trying to train swords, all the while starving to death. The game is a really cool concept, and when it works, theres fun to be had, but crew members floating in front of ships while attempting to fish, and suicidal AI really will ruin the experience. The game has potential, and if you want to help them along with finding bugs and the like, by all means buy the game, but realise this is NOT a finished product by any means, and that it will be buggy.

It's challenging, fun, open world, and something different everytime. I have encounters a few bugs, but nothing restarting the game hasn't gotten rid of so far.

Orders are buggy, the stats aren't balanced, skills don't seem to be applied properly, the morale system is clusmy and hard to deal with, it's borderline impossible to tell what's going on during combat (even with a lot of pauses). I also find the world too small, so that if I ever get even slightly stuck at a certain level of progression and can't win a fight, there's no way for me grind a little to get more gold and levels.It's a very frustrating experience, and I wouldn't recommend it.

												This game is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.I stepped into the game having watched paulsoaresjr's test drive video and bought it on sale.I started hiring my crew and off we sail!I felt so badass killing danger 1 pirate ships, and now I easily do 6.You start out so little, and end up so majestic.if you send out your crew to kill a bunch of easy danger 4 fellas, you just feel so delighted.Pure pownage.This game hasn't bored me for a minute.Don't start crying because I'm not going to compare this to minecraft.all I say is This game gave me like a very unique feel - you're gonna call me crazy for this - like minecraft had when you first started off.and hell I would pay a lot of money to geet that feeling back... No, It's extremely unique and one of it's kind.I've not yet started about the developers.Being a starting game developer I give these guys so much credit.They are active almost 24/7.I haven't seen a single question unanswered.They give away freaking FREE copies of the game to them in need. Blast for me.Even after all the credit I'm still missing a couple of things in the game.- There should be a multiplayer option. In the means of local co-op and online co-op AND PvP of some sorts.   The local co-op would be like you're both in the same crew, and each command your own members.- I really miss a feature to select pirates individually.   You always have to send your complete crew and they will fight whoever they feel like.   This often results in crewmember falling of the boar, etc.I rate this game 9.5/10Don't hesitate, just buy.and if you have money troubles just ask the dev. They'll crant you a copy but be sure to credit them though.			"

												Very well made, amusing game.I really like the customization aspect of the game.Only things I would be a bit iffy about isA. The Combat System. It's rather easy to get accidentally killed in this gameB. The Difficulty Spike. Some islands have five really tough dudes on it and can kill you easy, also going from a lvl 1 enemy to a lvl 2 enemy is a huge spikeC. Money. It's very very difficult to get money for yourself, and you have to spend it on a bunch of expensive important items.Overall, I like it.			"

												This is a game where you can play as a pirate in a pixely world. It's extremely addictive and a fun game to play. It's a great MMO-RPG game with loads of updates coming soon.The story of the game is amazing. Not only has it been made in an extremely short timeperiod, the creators etc. of the game have been very connected with the community and could not have made this game without them. You will not regret becoming a part of the Pixel Pirateers! "

								A really fun game, kind of reminds me of ""Terraria"" graphics wise but other than that completly different, feels a bit lonely to play at times but after all a very nice game to pass the time, I liked the fact you can create your own crew and design your ship the way you want it to.			"

												im gonna give it to you short and sweet.you start off as a single pirate, and you get the gold to hire the people in the tavern with the sailing to the islands and the islands have rogue hobos and the treausre chests and the hidden treasure chests. you hire more people, teach them the cooking, the cannon using, the walking faster, level them up with the exp and increase the stats they have and make them strong. you can fight the pirates on the sea or the chinese or the viking or any other thing i havent seen yet. your goal is too fight the 4 legendary pirates and kick the butts of them. some people even have perks when you hire them like beiong the blind, or being the poop machine.basicly, is fun game where you hire lots of pirates, plunder ships full of scrubs, dig for the treasure, and be a ♥♥♥♥ING PIRATE!

												You get what you pay for, assuming you bought this on sale.  Con:The mechanics are as simple as the graphics once you master the non-intuitive controls and menus.The characters' voices get really annoying really quickly, since they never stop chirping their single line over and over.  And I would swear that intro sfx when you first start the game is a dev's idea of a jump-scare joke.You spend more time micromanaging cleaning up poop and feeding your crew than the exciting parts of sailing and fighting.  Everything is more or less a passive experience.Poop jokes get old when it's ubiquitous and poop never stops in this game.There isn't enough variety in the encounters to make sailing not feel repetitive.  You meet different sprites and environments to interact with, but each interaction is more or less the same.Pro:Good music.  Not great music, but good music.There's enough item, perk, and equipment variety to keep you interested.Leveling and RPG elements for customization of pirates and your ship.There's some suspense in making sure you have enough food and funds to keep your characters happy and alive.You can play it windowed as you do something else, like listening to audiobooks or watching youtube videos.________________________________________________________________________________Conclusion:  For a couple bucks it's fine.  It's definitely no Terraria, but it's three steps up from playing solitaire or minesweeper.  You will playing on autopilot without paying too much attention to what's actually going on in the game for stretches, but there are moments when you succeed and you think to yourself, ""Hey, that's pretty nice,"" and moments where you are in trouble and think, ""Uh oh.  I better focus and pay attention.""  And that's good enough.			"

												i would not recomend this game to anyone in its current state. I am a huge Terraria Fan ( 438 hours on terraria) and this game has a great setup. Piracy sounds very fun. But because of the braindead AI ( for the trainer section have them only be able to TRAIN) and for crew have them only be able to do crew things etc. that would make a major improvement. Also the bugs are terrible for a released game. This game needs a major update before I play agian			"

								What this game is to me: FIrst a foremost, this is a rogue-like. You start with a single pirate, hire crew, pillage, then repeat indefinitely.Why it is fantastic: The value is in the details. You design your ship, level up your crew individually, equip them with gear, teach them skills that benefit combat or benefit the crew morale(cleaning, toilet training, etc). The presentation is fantastic and the little pirate voices will at least give you a good chuckle. The dev team is also very transparent and honest. They intend to support the game for a while after release.You will like it if you liked: FTL, Space Pirates & Zombies, most rogue-likes.			"

It went from shooting cannons until everyone was dead, to fighting off nosey pirates who boarded my ship before I even had a chance to load my cannons.  All I think this game needs is a better level up system and a story.I was instantly in love with the clever game system and beutiful pixel art.  Even though this is early development this game is as good as any steam game you'll find paroosing the vast expanse of steam games.  This game needs some sort of story, with a final objective.

								Pixel piracy is an amazingly indepth, customizable, and overall fun experience. Given that this game is only in the stage of alpha... it means nothing. This is one of the cleanest and most polished alpha games I have gotten my hands on to date. The developer staggers in loads of fixes and content every time I check. A solid buy, and a very solid play. I'm honestly glad I found the coupon in my inventory and decided not just to buy this for myself, but convince 2 other friends to pick it up as well.Graphics: 6.5/10(a) - Granted that the game is in alpha it is missing key things like multiple textures for ships, variation in enemies, and things of that nature. It doesn't hold the game back at all. Most of the randomized content is neat and intriguing, and I'm very excited to see more.Music/Sound: 7.5/10(a) - The music is catchy and fun to pass the time to. The sounds are very satisfying. ""Shiver me timbers"" became a quick inside joke amonst friends. I was tempted to give this a biased score of shivermetimbers/10.Gameplay: 9/10(a) - Wow. Blown away. There's so much that can be done and added to this game it makes my head spin. There's already enough to get spinning already. The customization of each character in your crew is determined at random, then further fine tuned with skills and leveling up stats. This allows you to make fighters, cooks, navigators, cannoneers. Wow. Wow. Amazing gameplay. Leads right into my next score of...Replayability: 10/10(a) - I've already gone on many voyages with many characters, With the randomization factor there's always an adventure to be had.Overall: 9/10(a) - For an alpha game this is a SOLID buy. I find myself coming back to this game and killing plenty of time. Checking for the updates on it. And wishing every month or so for new content. And that content comes. Thanks Dev.Keep up the good work. You've made a sick game.			"

								after noticing this game because of noticing i had two vouchers for the game, i decided to look into it more. after looking at youtube videos, screenshots, reviews and walkthroughs i was hooked. after buying the game i was amazed, the graphics were pixelated, shaders worked perfectly, music was piratey but suited the games feel, you could buy supplies, goods, stuff to build your ship with, weapons and more. the atmosphere is incredible. At night comets and stars glimmer in the sky, at day fish and sharks swim under water, trees wave slowly on islands and it feels really fluent.I highly reccomend this game for all the reasons above and more.

								Pixel Piracy is a game that, while still in development, already shows the makings of a great game. You get to build your own pirate ship and try to keep an unruly and kinda dumb group of pirates together. And keep them alive. More often than not you will be the one going into the fray if you want to keep all your little friends alive. If you don't care so much for them though, feel free to send them off onto an enemy ship or to battle a group of native tribesmen on an island then go clean up the mess when they're gone, and pick up their spare cash. They won't need it anymore.All in all it is a fun game that, with some more polishing, will shine. I recommend it.			"

Besides it is an early access game so I can't complain to much about that.  This game can be very challenging.  I find myself having a hard time maintaining crew and fighting high leveled opponents but am glad that I did not spend my money on something I can breeze through.  Plundering ships and taking loot has been very interesting but challenging later on.  Once the game got easy and I advanced agaisnt higher levels the difficulty expands fast as I struggle to maintain crew and even my own ship.  I find myself addicted to this game now and enjoying it the whole way.			"

												I find this game ridiculously annoying, but at the same time ridiculously fun!I want to just jump straight into the action of being a pirate! Sail the open seas, find burried treasure, battle other pirates...but then I get wrecked by a sea crab. The game forces you to ascend the ranks of piracy, starting from a freshling to becoming a feared pirate of the seas! You need to level your pirates up, teach them how to do things using EXP (or in this game TP), and build your ship so it can hold them all and fight others.The only downside I bump into (And it may just be because I relax and play on my laptop quite a bit) is that when I enter places with lots of pirates, and there are lots of pirates everywhere, it lags quite a bit almost to the point of not being able to play.

												Great concept and idea. Decent execution which however suffers from bad development.  In other words game is buggy and not fleshed out too greatly. Tutorial for one doesn't explain all features at all. Bugs are still in game and they are game breaking. Captain being stuck on edge of shore being the worst one since you cannot continue the game when that happens. Then there is bugs like ranged skill not gaining experience from use and many balancing issues.  Also seems like development has stopped and team has moved on. Which leaves you with the bugs at hand forever.  Regrettably I cannot recommend this game and would suggest staying away from this even when it is 75 % off.			"

												I do not recommend it for the full price, but if you can catch a huge sale, it might be worth it (iirc i got it on humble bundle).It has decent gameplay, cute visuals. Weakest point is the audio, which becomes very repetitive and annoying in a very short time because every single pirate says something when you issue them a command (which is reeeaaally great if you have more than 20 units on your ship)The game also has some performance issues.Despite all of that, i think it can be fun in short bursts....also the dev has a strange fixation on poop if you are into that sort of thing. ಠ‿ಠ			"

												Awesome Game. Runs smooth with little bugs. Its a fast paced game with not to much time for you to learn how to play in the start so it can be very frustrating until you learn the game better.The only problem is the morale system is poorly designed, causeing your pirates morale to drop so fast at times there is nothing you can do. Also it causes you to rush through the game because of it. Hopefully the developers get to fixing this HUGE issue soon but they seem to want to ignore the problem**Update: Morale system fixed**			"

												I bought this game on a whim ignoring the negative reviews which at the time of my purchase were the only visible reviews of the game. This game has many things going well for it, Pixel Piracy is a fun sandbox pirate crew simulator with rpg elements. There are still some bugs, but it is very playable. I rate games on a doller per hour basis and Pixal piracy for me was worth about $1 an hour of play. If your on the fence give it a try. Its worth it.			"

												Pixel Piracy is a great game, but only if you don't mind having to keep track of a lot of stuff (it's still not that bad). It's a good game for its kind and it allows the player to be creative. If you like Terraria, then you'll (most likely) like this one. The main thing that makes this game ""completed"" is the food and morale managing and the little tweaks and bonuses that will help you progress even further. (when morale goes too low, your crew members start attacking each other). You also get to ""manage"" your crew, level up stats and change weapons and passive items (RPG style). If you like hijacking big boats and killing bad guys with your crew, this game is for you. I loved it, so I recommend it!			"

												Kinda torn about this one, it's not a bad game....but not phenomenal either.Very similar to Terraria in looks, however the gameplay is far shallower.You are trying to assemble a crew of dastardly pixelated bucaneers, while micromanaging their growth and constructing your ship, or just taking someone else'sYou must manage crew food, which cannot be laid out while on the sea for some reason.Also morale is an issue, but a good fight or some rum  will solve that.  As the game progresses, tactics usually boil down to ""gather all crew, board enemy ship....wait for your people to win or lose.""   Worth it during a sale, but most definitely not at full price.Also, one point....the sound effect for paying your crew's wages is bizzarely SUPER LOUD, but seems to be tied to the ""voice"" volume slider not sound effects.

								I had a brand new crew of two (Captain Schmuck and his father, Horke) and I built a small, two block raft. My plan was to find an enemy pirate captain and relieve him of his vessel. Much to my dismay, my starting town was surrounded by islands, so I randomly selected one to search for loot. On the first island, Horke was murdered by hobos. Distraught by the loss of his father, Captain Schmuck ran back to the beach, hoisted his grappling hook upon the deck of his raft, shimmied along the rope, took a few too many steps and fell off the other side of the raft and drowned.10/10			"

												The game is decent for the pricetag it has. But features a myriad of problems from both a technical and gameplay standpoint that brings the game down from being fun to a chore around the time you reach the first legendary pirate. At first the game draws you in with a customizable crew with the ability to customize them based on stats and job placement, usually jobs being decided on which skill books you give them and what their stats are at, which at first is pretty great and makes you feel like you are controlling a real crew.  You take your crew and you assault and resource farm the hundreds of islands  for skill books, treasures, and resources. You also attack enemy pirate ships with your own. usually blasting them with cannons then boarding their ship to take each an everyone out. Although combat is automated. You can really tell you are advancing when your crew is customized in such a way that they send a pirate flying before all taking shots at him in the air with their flintlock pistols. The game has a variety of items. Not too much. But enough to satisfy. Weapon choice comes down to what either has good knock back or what has good damage and never inbetween. which actually brings me to the point that makes the game sour. once you got a good enough feel for the game. You realize there is only one good strategy to win with minimal or no crew loss. Which is as follows:-always use melons as your food source, and captains ale for morale-always have a small barrier on both sides of your ship to prevent your crew from being thrown into the drink-although i need to test this on a new game. I'm pretty sure if you never put any cannons on your ship then you can always straight board a ship and attack directly. which is a good idea. If this is false. then commanding your whole crew to dodge cannon shots after the enemy fires its first cannon becomes mundane as you wait 30 seconds to directly attack-always have your entire crew attack. it's always a guranteed victory. the game also has an unintuitive menu system. with an inability to simply choose to heal multiple members at once. instead having to pick each indivisual member and going through two menus to heal them. And then there are the glitches.most of which are the most frequent of problems are as follows:-if a crewmember has a complete list of skills. you can't use the same skillbook to level up a skill they already have. They will instead equip it. even if the skill isn't at max level.-some crewmembers or your captain will cease movement or even cease attack. forcing you to pause the game and use the drag attack/move icon to get them to attack or move-poop and bodies being stuck in your ship forever. making it impossible to remove damaged hull.-later on, the game has performance issues where it will lag to a crawl at random intervalsI'd wait for a price drop if you want to play the game. it can be fun. but the way it is now. it feels like a five dollar game.

												I recommend that you search for the top most helpful reviews and read the issues posted there. They have a great summary.

Send all your pirates at the same place at once, and even after they will just wonder off after a second.RELOGIC made a great game called Terraria.

												I wish i could recommend this game...It's good for a few hours, but after a while the game gets boring and repeatable, there's nothing to do , ur just traveling from town to town, from island to island. from my opinion even a big feature the ship building is also not complex enough...You may try Re Logic's other game Terraria wich is fantastic, if you like the developers Pixel Piracy is a good chance to donate them with some money.So in a nutshell the game is boring and I DO NOT recommend buying it!

Early Access Review
								Great game, If you don't start out right you are screwed in the future. Though altogether fun, addicting, and tme will pass slowly. RECOMMENDATION: Strategizing if a big part. Know how to solve things and figure things out.Do not buy if not good at puzzles. Age 10+?Pros: Open World, Design your own ship!, Paying, feeding and arming your crew, Attacking!Cons: Some bugs (IT'S IN ALPHA!)Just because you can't beat your first enemy doesn't mean it's a bug. ""OMG! I DIED ON MY FIRST TRY, SO MANY BUGS!"" -_-			"

												Pixel Piracy is a game that has never felt finished, and any enjoyment that may have been possible is doomed by its repetitive nature.  Every island looks similar, and feels identical.  Enemy ships suffer similarly, although they at least benefit from some more obvious variety in appearance.  The gameplay never changes.  Kill everything on an island, or kill every pirate/use canons upon the enemy ship.  In both of these circumstances this entails throwing your pirates at the enemy.  Little variation, and minimal required strategy from my experience: every battle that I fought was won by just ordering every crew member to head in the direction of the enemy and then sitting back and wataching inevitable victory, no matter that difficulty level.  It all results in an experience that feels exactly as repetitive as it is.  True, one can say with relative certainty that there will be an element of repetition in any game; but the best games hide this well.  Pixel Piracy not only fails to hide it, it never seems to make an effort to do so.  And that, perhaps, is the biggest failing.  In spite of what the developers may or may not have to say on the subject, it never felt to me as though very much effort was put into the game.  What content there is (and, again, it never feels like very much) feels slapped together and unfinished, or poorly thought out from the start; and while I could overlook a feature or two that felt that way, EVERY feature elicited the same sort of response from me.I cannot recommend the game.  Its execution is far too poor, and it seems unlikely that any more effort will be put into any sort of improvement or addition.			"

												This game really pisses me off because it seems so awesome at first, but the fact that its really not finished at all ruins it. I have even read there were MORE features in the early access that were removed prior to release.Broken list that i found-Animal abilities are stated that they only effect the ""host"" i assume that means whoever is holding the animal, making it totally useless, doubly so because only the captain can pick up animals-slave shackles dont work, at all, complete waste-if you tell your crew to attack something specific it will only work for one half second before the %&$# off and do whatever-all the cool stuff you can add to your ship for the pirates to do is also a total waste, because it will just use up ALL of your fishermen and thats all, starving your crew to death as they refuse to do anything else but play cards or read books or sharpen their fishing rods-Repeatedly get stuck on the far side of towns because the captain cannot pass back threw one of the doors of the shops-inability to sail to sectors where you have already defeated pirate ships-crew members interact with cannons in the most stupid way immaginable, every crew member will rush to whatever ammo is closest to the front of the ship, completely ignoring anything else that would be closer and better to use-pandas have no abilities whatsoever-fishermen will often cast their line over and over and over and over, never catching anything or even trying to remain fishing, seems to happen more often the better your boat gets.-crew members with cleaning will not try to find their own poop to clean, but chase other crew members holding poop sometimes taking it out of their hands.-crew members that have the ""bully trait"" will get the rest of your crew killed off one at a time because the guys they jab at will turn against your whole crew for some reason, this even happened to my captain-drowning enemies results in power lvling to the extreme for all crew members and all animals on board the ship-some pirates will stay on board the ship when told to board, because they fail to climb up the one brick to get to the end of the ship and board-Customizing the ship often breaks to where you cannot remove any parts, but can still add parts, nevermind the fact that the shop interface totally obscures what you are doing if you try to customize while a interact command is available-one setup I had for my ship with the animals in a seperate smaller boat behind my main boat caused every crew member to drown when sailing away from a town-If you have more items then will fit on your equipment screen there is no way to access what has scrolled off the bottom-sushi equips doing nothing instead of being usedI could write more, but im so sad about what i have already written that im just going to stop nowI REALLY REALLY want to love this game, but its just sooooooo broken i cant, maybe the most disappointing game i have played since fable 2, my hopes were so high, and thus dashed more severely.

												Well i really want to like this game.. in fact i do enjoy the idea behind it. But... its so full of bugs i have yet to get past 10 days in game, which is about 2 hrs, the reason being the amount of bugs that break the game are insane, and worst of all, out of the 10 playthorughs i have attempted, there was a different game breaking bug in each one, meaning this game is seriously in bad shape. The Dev team has released 3 ""Bug Fixing""patches, yet the community is mind ♥♥♥♥ed as to why none of the bugs are actually fixed. When we report out bugs, they get mad and say "" We already Fixed that read your patch notes"". WELL READ YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING FORUMS YOU SLUM DEVS!! There are so many bugs they have created a seperate web page for just Bug reports, LMAO that should tell you how bad it is. When visiting that page, you can see that over 145 pages of seperate bugs are in game, and most if not all have a red/yellow highlight meaning they are still in game. So sad, casue the game was in good shap about 4 months ago and i was totally blown away when they came out of no where saying they were shipping the game in its current state. Buyer Beware, i can say with a truthfull heart that this game is not worth the money, and even if it did run smooth the game is a major let down in the end! without to much of a sploier alert there really is not more then 1 playthrough of content. They lied..... :( hope this helps you wait or go another route, you wont miss much until its more solid, and you wont miss much if you skip it either.			"

												So, what to say? I have an intimate knowledge as to why my sailors refer to it as a ""poop deck"". I've seen said poop flung over the side of the ship and against the walls of the ship. I've seen sailors die for no apparant reason and had hp drain for no reason as well. The game itself needs a few tweeks; like an event log, mouseover tooltips, full icons/desc for status effects both positive and negative, typos fixed in pirate descriptions, logical skill assessment (a diver that can't swim, derp), ***A fix for crew randomly turning into aggro enemies and being attacked/killed***, captain starting skill (sailing, cooking, fishing... something guys), an easier way to grab chickens/animals without attacking ALL of them and if you're going to have names like Loraine and Mandy it's okay to have a ""She"" in there they're not all men and that's okay, lol. So, for the TL;DR types it's frustrating the way this game screws up and lacks tutorials for many things. I had cannons on my ship I stole off of some Imperials but could never get them to fire or my guys to actually go to the guns even though they were assigned to gunner jobs and weren't lazy. All of that being said it's ridiculously fun and going to be great when the developers get to these few bugs so I definitely recommend picking it up and flinging some poo around while sailing.PS: If they do not add some of those things, like the tooltips, recent event/activity log and bug fix for random death I can't promise that'll stay the case as those are the most frustrating things about the game to date, for me. For now I'll just call these flaws ""Bugbeard"" and hope the scourge is brought to the end of a plank sooner than later.			"

								Pixel Piracy is a indie game. it's a simple 2D indie game. In Pixel Piracy you're supposed to run your own pirate ship with your own crew. The world of Pixel Piracy is massive. There are a lot of things to do. Like discovering new islands, new towns and you can customize your own ship ofcourse! Let's look at the pros and consPros:- Easy to run on every PC- A lot of different things to do- As the developers say: There will be coming a lot more in the game- Amazing sound effectsCons:- You can only customize the game itself a bit (so far)- The game isn't to much fun at the current state of developing.

												This game is such a mess, and makes no sense. It's complicated enough to make a tutorial necessary, but whoever wrote the tutorial has no business EVER writing tutorials. 1) The instructions tell you to interact with things that are worded differently than in the instructions. This becomes a much large deal when it's part of a character sheet with tons of things to look through to guess at what they're taling about.2) There's no logical flow. The instructions tell you to go to a vendor, then you do nothing with the vendor and instead build remotely on your ship with things that are alread in your inventory, and that the vendor doesn't sell anyways. 3) The movement instructions at the very beginning are clunky, not really defining how one click always does one thing, and the other does the same thing, but contexturally with different members. 4-5) There's (4) no backtracking to understand the context of an instruction; and (5) no tutorial protection to prevent you from having any possibility of proceeding. EXAMPLE: You are fumbling with the movement instructions, since they're so unconventional. Once it dawns on you by trial and error, and you've figured that out, the tutorial has skipped ahead without you wanting it to or completing the previous thing. It's now asking you to interact with an object you have no idea how to interact with. You aren't sure how to interact with it. You assume since you were told to go to a vendor and they don't have the object, that you sell them the object. Then you figure out it was asking you to do something with the object, but you sold it, and can't buy it, so you have to restart a new game to proceed with the tutorial. And that's after you spent a lot of time ramdomizing your captains look. And even a patient person is getting beyond agitated at the game.6) Almost impossible to do as instructed (with wartermellon and placement, because there's so much poop around, and you can't place on poop, but the tutorial has told you nothing at this point with how to deal with it).7) Inconsisancy of logic.In one scenario the tutorial asks you to go to a screen (vendor), and you'd suspect you are supposted to interact with it, but no you are not. In another screen, they ask you to go to a screen (skills) and now that you weren't supposed to interact with the last one (vendor), you assume you are not supposed to interact with the skill because you haven't been told to. But no, you'd be wrong again.8) Text goes by too quickly when there's no interaction to do.So your crew member that you upgraded suddenly attacks you. It flashes 2-3 screens of text up when this starts to happen, but there's no way to read them fast enough, so you have no idea of the lesson you were supposed to learn by that (or humor if there was no lesson). Then it abruptly says end of tutorial, and you are left sitting there having no idea what just happened nor the will to proceed after this series of insultingly frustrating blows. For the record: I think the lesson was something about moral, or payment you need to provide the crew to keep them happy. But I don't know. If my assumption is correct, wouldn't it have been a heck of a lot more helpful for the tutorial to show you how to deal with moral (or at minimum mention it was an issue), instead of pranking you for being a noob because you didn't know something the game never mentioned?I'm all for a briefer, more to the point tutorial that doesn't walk you through things agonizingly slowly. But what in the world is this mess? I've never experience such a frustrating start to a title that looked fun. The companies other game is one of the best ever (which has no effictive tutorial, which is better than this mess, but that game is more conventionally simple to get started in, and you can get away with it).Maybe the game is good, but why would I want to continue playing at this point?!  I feel like the game has agonizingly pulled me through it's flaws, then slapped me for trying. Horrid experience. DON'T BUY!			"

												I had such serious problems with the controls to this game that I couldn't even get off the first island and start the actual game. The only buttons and commands that seemed to do anything were the camera controls, left clicking for captain movement and menu navigation.You're started on an island as a lone captain and you can move by left clicking on the screen and the captain will waddle over there. The camera does not follow the captain by itself, but you can force this by holding down the ""keep the camera centered on the captain"" button. I remember you start with 50 gold and you can hire a pirate from some menu somewhere. I spent all my gold on a brickmaker and then he just disappeared and didn't follow the captain as I moved across the island. The brickmaker wasn't even back at the ship so I have no idea what happened.Even worse, I was constantly bombarded by a giant message in the middle of the screen telling me to press the spacebar to interact, and press the spacebar I did. I pressed the spacebar so much that the number of spaces you see in this review is minuscule compared to how many times I pressed it in the game. I didn't do this because it accomplished anything or because it made something interesting happen. No, I did it out of frustration because I wasn't getting any damn sign of functionality and I hated the fact that I was stuck on the first screen in the game.Now that we've established the spacebar doesn't do anything, let's go over the other buttons that do nothing: q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p,a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,z,x,c,v,b,n,m,ctrl,shift,tab,enter,backspace,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9. I obviously bound all the controls necessary to play the game in the launcher before I started but it clearly didn't make a bit of difference. You might have noticed I omitted the number 3 and I'll have you know it wasn't a mistake. 3 surprisingly did something. 3 unsurprisingly did anything useful. 3 Will toggle the visibilty of a red square on a status box at the top of the screen about your crew. I noticed that without a red square, right clicking would print a message about no crew being selected. Having a red square in that status box suppressed these messages and made a light blue circle appear at my mouse pointer, flash, and then disappear without any effect.I want to talk about this light blue circle a little more, as I am guessing it is supposed to be moving my crew members. Remember that brickmaker I hired? Well if I'm right about the blue circle, then this brickmaker has got to be the most rebellious, dysfunctional and annoying man I ever had the misfortune of being associated with. He would wander the island and get lost in the tavern crowds. No blue light could snap this psycho out of his crazed episode of alzheimer's. It did appear that my blue light was attracting other tavern-goers, but they only seemed to be attracted to it for mere seconds before repeatedly side-stepping nothing. Right clicking was so unreliable that I decided it was more correlation that characters would sometimes act as though they were following the captain, than it was causation.Finally, I've saved the most horrible thing for last: ""Loser!"". Constantly. I can not hate it enough. There seriously was a game developer somewhere on this planet who actually thought it was a good idea to have an annoying, high-pitched voice shout at most every 10 seconds that you are a loser. It was so bad that I not only muted the voices, but the music and sound effects as well just to be sure I'd really be rid of it.One little strange thing was that in the menu for my list of current crew members, the game's description of my female captain used male pronouns. Weird.The one and only partially entertaining thing about this game is that you can edit your pirate flag. . . with 4 available colors. You get black, white, yellow and red. The best thing I could come up with was a skull with lipstick and yellow eyeliner and white text below that said ""BFF"".Pretty soon, I found the only reason I had this game running (I did not say ""playing"". Why would I play it after all this?) was to slowly gather steam trading cards. Unfortunately, all I can see in this game is a price you pay to be able to write a review, get trading cards, and be called a loser to no end.Not fun. Did not enjoy.			"

												I've waited for this title for quite a bit now so I started playing it with really positive approach. I loved the idea of tiny, pixelated pirates having battles on sea and islands but this game did everything it could to make me not have fun while doing so.GUI is just horrible, there's not a single intuitive thing in this game.Grindcore festival. I have nothing about being underpowered at the start of the game while you're discovering how stuff works but Pixel Piracy takes it to another level:- Travel between nearest locations takes so long that you can easily ALTTAB out of the game and read a medium sized article on a gaming website before your crew arrives to their destination.- Crew sh*ts on deck and it stays there. Ok, concept seemed intriguing at start, you're a pirate, you're at sea trash and excrement have to go somewhere. What's the solution you might ask, well it's to find an island with a shop that sells book about ""Cleaning"" and teach one of your pirates that instead of him getting anything else (skill/stat) when levelling up. That doesn't solve the issue, it just makes everyone take a dump like they did previously while one guy is flinging it into the air and then it disappears. If you want to make it stop you need to sacrifice one level of each of your guys for ""Toilet manners"" or something like this. Since you don't get that much spare gold at start to buy so many books your whole ship looks like and acts like a sh*t-cannon.Controlling ""bigger"" fights. I've stopped playing after my first 6v6 encounter on multi-leveled ship. The complete lack of control I've had during that battle made me realize that there is no way I will have any fun with this game in the future while the battles get bigger and bigger.			"

												This game is not ready yet.  Still lots of game breaking bugs.-Bugs wouldn't be so bad if you could go back and load a save from a previous point before you experienced the bug, but you only have one save and the autosave is so aggressive you will end up with a save at a point where your game is ruined by a bug.-The settings menu is very difficult to use.  A slider bar for boolean values?  -Bugs include:--Crew will refuse to eat prepared food.--Crew becomes unhappy because they won't eat prepared food.  You try to move food around and rebuild ship, but by that time they are too unhappy to do anything.  So they won't get back on the boat and eat the food, so they essentially refuse to do the one thing that will solve their hunger issue which made them unhappy in the first place.  So on top of that you have to spend a bunch of gold to get them back on the boat.  This cycle of refusing to eat, unhappeness, and then having to  make them happy the most expensive way leaves me with no gold and eventually they all turn on each other.--Can't remap some of the keys so if you are a left handed mouser and move your keys to the right side of the keyboard, you can't remap the 1-6 keys for selecting crew groups which you will find yourself using often.--Crew becomes unhappy very very fast.  So much for being a hardy bunch willing to tough out the hard times for the rewards that await them.  If Sir Francis Drake had a crew such as this, he wouldn't have faired well.			"

												The game consists of visiting the same 3 locations over and over, while listening to the pirates annoying repetitive phrases and dealing with terrible performance. Wondering if there was much difference past the starting area and discovered there was not. The menu and controls are clunky as all hell as well as the load of bugs and glitches i discovered in my first half hour, ridiculous! When a player has to seriously google how to use controls and such for a platform indie game the devs should really evaulate themselves. It seriously feels like an unfinished game.I liked it for a whole 10 minutes. 0/10 PP Devs... rework the game please... the concept is great, the game is not.			"

								It's a great game, but at the same time it gets boring a bit too quick. It's nearly almost the same thing over and over again, and you die plus starve a bit too quick. Don't get me wrong, if you play your cards right and get lucky, you could have a great game here, but at the same time, which is most likely, the chance of rivalry and starvation is quite too high. I do however love the games items, the adventure, and I would say that the game is worth the money, most deffinately! The Pro's are in much more number than the cons, and just writing this makes me wanna play it again. I never ran into a Pirate, and not only pirate, but a pixel one before, making this game unique and extremely rare. But as I said, play your cards right, and tread carefully, and you could enjoy this game to its max potential. The characters plus the voices are also a great attribute to the game, it's hard not to laugh when you here all their phrases and voice pitches.			"

												For all the pros, the cons just hold far too much balance of power: game is too short, and far too easy; it would be easy to complete in under 12 hours. It is far too repetitive; it is a terrible sign in any game if, within an hour, you are already considering the repetetiveness of the tasks. Game mechanics have been presented poorly: animals, ship building, travel - it's all disappointing.Like every game, there are pros and cons. However, to emphasise how weak this game is, I will not be giving it the honour of presenting any pros. One can play it themselves if they wish for an indepth understanding.			"

												I've only clocked 20 minutes of gameplay at this point, and that's all it took to determine that this title has earned every single one of its negative reviews.To start with, the menu looks like it was ripped out of Goat Simulator with virtually no changes made.Instructions appear in tiny eye-strain-inducing text, and in the 20 minutes I've played I've already counted 10 typos. The User Interface is completely unintuitive.The Pirates are a chore to control. Bottom line: Pixel Piracy looks and plays like something in Early Access. What's even more insulting about this is the fact that there are titles currently IN Early Access that are already far better than this one. I bought this on sale for $2.74CDN and I still feel like I was ripped off. Do yourself a favor - if you want to play a game that involves exploration, being the leader of your own crew and having a vessel that you can continuously upgrade, buy yourself FTL instead. "

												It's okay. It's a rogue-like, supposedly, so I expected more variability and more death, but I pretty much got in the habit of murderating anything the game could throw at me before I was 2/3rds of the way to the first boss and the game never got more difficult. There are several types of enemies, but there's no difference (I could see, at least) in each one's play style. Since there are 4 bosses and you can pretty much beat the game before the first, the last 75% of the game is just repetitively navigating around a square map to the four corners to beat the ""legendary pirates"". This game would be a looooooot better if there was more variability and the bosses weren't all all the same level, but rather you fought each one in a row and each was harder than the last. In my opinion, of course.			"

Paying your Men's Salery, Buying more fighters, Paying for more of your fighters, Buy Cooks and Docters, Pay for your Cooks and Docters, Buy more Fighters, Pay for your more Fighters, Buy Some Weapons, Lose and Gain Gold, Forgeting to Dig or Buy something from an island, Steam Chating with your friends while battling and dying in battle or seeing that your are being traddered by one of your Men.Lots of OP runs, but the lucky runs count. 10/10 "

												RRR! Being a Pirate hasn't been this fun since Assassin's Creed 4. Though lacking in the graphics, the fact that you can mold your crew and ship makes this game have loads of replay value... which is good because the Bosses in this game are pretty easy. The permadeath on crewmembers can either make this game really sad or more fun by sending your bad members on suicide missions. Loads of fun!			"

												Pixel Piracy had some rough days it's in early life but, it has since gotten a lot better and is a very good game now as long as you know what you are looking at when buying it. You aren't looking at any sort of deep narrative game or such, but instead a game that providies you with a nice sandbox to go around and play as a pirate and his crew. The ability to hire and upgrade various pirates, as well as building your ship help give the game a lot of charm and lasting power as you go around doing different quests or just exploring for treasure.Avast Matey!

								An Amazing Indie TitleWhile being fun, Pixel Piracy maintains a great level of difficulty, due to it's permadeath, and strategic challenges. The mechanics are elegant and easy to pick up, yet they provide an underlying complexity, that brings stories from gameplay, and not from cutscenes.The developer is very friendly towards his consumers, and does a great job of communicating with his audience.

												What a game.. just ♥♥♥♥in amazing. As soon as i saw Re-logic(terraria devs) were involved, i knew it.The beauty of this game is the same as in terraria. A complex game, with rich details and interesting mechanics, that blends strategy (ship building, crew forming) with rpg (skill giving, gearing, lvling) in an extremely simple way that is reflected on its graphics... Simple ♥♥♥♥in pixels...It is damn addicting.. it is simpler and faster than ""space pirate and zombies"", it is better working than ""craft the world"", it is actually more action packed than ""Sid Meier's Pirate"" and its fun as f0cK!!!You build your crew, you gear them up, you give them skills, you build your boat, you plunder ships and dig up loot... lol what else can i say!? This game is rich in mechanics but not at complex as it seems!!! took me 2 minutes to actually understand stats and lvling and gear. Its simple and no tutorial is actually required (eventhough there is a short 1).The amount of hours i have in this game were in the course of 3-4 days... i literally stopped doing everything else just to play this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Alas a game that made me forget everything for a short time lol.The only ""meh"" thing, is the music,  buuuttt i guess if it were anything different than the simple tune it is, i wouldnt enjoy it after 13 hours of straight playing FURTHERMOAAARRROAARR!!! The devs are always always implementing stuff... and fixing stuff.. so yea... buy it already...			"

								Pixel Piracy is a new take on the roguelite genre where you hire a crew of pirates, build your ship and sail off to battle other pirates or raid islands for all their gold and treasure. You can even steal other ships if you want to. As you progress and level up your crew you will be able to increase the size of your boat and crew and plunder more dangerous areas for even greater rewards. There are also other things to consider while playing such as food for the hunger of your crew and paying your crew to increase their morale and upgrading your crews gear.Although I have had to look many things up and It's got a few amount of bugs and sound bugs in the game and it can be a very hard game but once I think it's finished It will be a really good game.Overall this is a very fun and enjoyable game, the music is also great and I would highly recommend you purchasing it!

								It's a fairly good game. It is a rogue-like adventure/action game.  The game itself has come a long way. You are a pirate, a captain. Customize your own ship to your liking, hire a crew to defend you and defeat the legendary pirates! You'll find yourself fighting off hostile pirates on their ships, animals, tribe members, and hobos on islands to open a chest and get loot!You'll also be adding ability books for your pirates to help you along your jouneys, the books can be purchased in stores found in towns, or dropped rarely by a few things..Managing your crew is a VERY important aspect to survive, you must keep your crew well fed and happy (high morale) unless you want them to die or turn against you and try to kill your entire crew.When you first start a game, you'll be asked 3 questions which you'll answer. According to what your owner, your game will be affected a little bit. The developers of this game are amazing, they listen to the people and do their best to make them happy, being someone who has played this game since alpha, i can say that they have not been a let down. Buying this game at full price is well worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a fantastic concept that just needs some polish and balance. At first I thought the game was far to much random chaos, such as when nothing is happening and my crew will walk off the ship or at times my ship will just glitch and pieces will be moved or just vanish. Considering that pirates can't swim I'd like to see something capable of stopping them from running into the sea like they have a suicide pact with the kraken. Even after placing ladders along all the edges they'll still walk off or jump off and drown. At first I thought the game was to hard thanks to the random chaos, but I found that the real balancing issue is that you don't even have to fight at all to level up. You can literally just sail between two locations and level up and live by fishing and cooking while drinking at a tavern. No effort required at all, my captain was level 75 before I even got into a fight. He was so overpowered he was a demigod among pirates, this takes all challenge and sense of achievement out knowing that you can abuse it so easily with every pirate in your crew. It's so broken that I took out a legendary enemy with a raft and 3 pirates. And the fact that you can save scum (which is almost required if you're not using the sailing abuse method) to get the perfect island or settlement is terrible, it's a glaring reminder that the game is unbalanced, the save scumming is almost on XCOM's level. This game is a fantastic concept that I would really love to see improved upon. Before adding content I would suggest finding a better balance for this game. It's either to hard with all the chaos such as the enemy shooting their own ship with their own cannons and killing everyone (Seriously a suicide pact with the kraken), or boars ramming everyone off the island. Or you just sail to your hearts content and transform your pirates into demigods and never deal with any challenge or danger aside from the enemy sinking their own ship with you on it. Fine tuning and some balancing would be so welcome that I believe this game could be as massive an indie hit as Terraria or Rogue Legacy. There are other small issues but none so large as this balancing issue, improve it and I'll keep playing but until then the game is almost unplayable. Signing off now.... a gamer that really things your game has massive potential.Update: I'm extremely pleased that a swimming trait is possible to obtain now, but it's stifled by these new instant death traits. I don't mind a few negatives to keep the game interesting but going out and just implementing instant death traits even on the captain at the very start of the game (Such as the ""old"" trait which causes random death at any given moment.(Yes this happened to me!)) add to the already chaotic difficulty I've talked about already. These new traits that cause death such as falling off the boat along with being ""old"" almost demand that you save scum just to get an average pirate or they have no chance of surviving whatsoever. Don't read this and think I'm ungrateful, the fact that I can swim now is a fantastic boon, but the instant death traits are just far to out of control. Perhaps you could add new passives such as a swimming technique (Ultimate) or a life jacket that isn't destroyed much like the other passive item. (I forgot the name of it.) Sincerely yours a gamer that really hopes you find a balance you and the players can both agree on entirely, have a great day!			"

												Well, I got this game from Humble Indie Bundle 14 and I must say that generally I enjoy similar games, so I decided to give it a try. I couldn't have been more disappointed. First of all, I don't understand the game, the HUD isn't perspicuous to me and I didn't know what was going on. I just clicked anywhere hoping that I will finally achieve something, but I couldn't. I died like 3 times and I didn't really know why. The very big con for me is that after 5 minutes of playing, I got like 5 or 6 achievements, so it wasn't a very big effort, especially when I didn't know what I was doing. Achievements should be granted for achieving something, obviously... Well, maybe disobeying the urge to exit this game as soon as possible was something I was honoured for ;). The sounds in the game are very very very very annoying. All I heard was this stupid ""yes"" all the time, it drove me crazy. And pooping on the ship isn't funny at all. I was hoping for something much better, while the only thing that kept me playing were Steam Cards... What a pity.			"

The game is haunted by critical and even gamebreaking bugs even long after release. Bugs that can be solved pretty quickly if the involved coders are worth their money. Unfortunatly this doesnt seem to be the case at all. (Im working in the same biz so I can assume to have some knowledge about this)If you are very strong-willed you might be able to see over a very buggy game - filled with gamebreakers that forces you to revert saves every now and then - this game might of some value to you.If you look for a solid gameplay experience you better stay away from this.

												This game is fine. I can't recommend it based on the performance and UI problems. Toward the end of the game I had stuttering so bad I couldn't even move the camera. This made placing items on your ship even more tedious. The UI also had me frustrated at many points and it was only until later I figured out I could scroll the list of items you can equip on a pirate. SO MUCH CLICKING. An inventory that let you select multiple items would have gone a long way. Buying 10x an item and having to click for each was brutal.There needed to be some more automation with the elements that were tedious (placing food, leveling up pirates). It would have been better if their were less weapons but they were more diverse. I was drowning in weapons and just gave up figuring out which ones did what when usually the ones that were already leveled are the best.The ship building is fun although extremely pointless. Allowing the player to customize their experience with their own ship and naming of their pirates is what this game did best.I hate to be so negative because I could see the potential of a game like this but this one fell short.

								Great game if you love roguelikes, pirates, and the combination of the two! Very fun game, many traits and customization options that make each try new, exciting, and full of discovery. Devs are extremely active, friendly, and receptive to feedback. So this game will only get better and better! Get out there, explore the seas, raid some ships, and whatever you do, don't forget to bring lots of food! Good luck mateys, arrrrrr!			"

												6/10 all over for the 2D Pixel game. I like Pixel art. So, I prefer to pay this game so much. I rather enjoy after already learned the game system.4/10 for the game processing system. The game is very jerky sometime, after I had 7-15 crews. I don't know why, but I can still play it with the less fun. The game saving and loading are very bad. You will never know how many place where you able to save the game.8/10 for the unique graphic , sound and items. It is truly Pixel!! Yeal, I really like these points.6/10 for the ingenuity of those NPC. Sometimes they do something wacky and silly, sometimes they do something very clever. You can't individually control your crews. You never know what they will do. They may drown because of the silly walks on a pirate ship. They might help or not help you fight.5/10 for the instruction or tutorials. It's hard to understand. Most likely you have to try by yourself.			"

								HOLY ♥♥♥♥ MY♥♥♥♥♥♥AND GO♥♥♥♥♥♥SOME BRICKS THIS GAME IS AMAZING! Ive only played a bit of it and i cant even fathom how much more stuff I have to discover. This game is a hilarious, cute and funny pixel by pixel rendition of what it would be like to be a pirate!It has a serious, ""Its a permadeath game so dont like, ... die."" element to it but it seems to focus more on the side of, ""Game Over! you got killed by a chicken!"" (That actually happened like to me) The funny and goofy side while funny, somehow dosent take to much away from the game like most, ""Goofy"" games do.The ship building, while it has a slight learning curve manages to be simple, easy and fun. Though your first ship will most definatly look like a large piece of Caribbian Seagul feces, you will quickly catch on and find a sophisticated design that works for you!The RPG side of the game and the complicated leveling system may look daunting at first, but give it maybe, 3 times around of playing the game and getting you♥♥♥♥♥handed too you and you will quickly undersand why it is 300 pieces of gold to train a crew member to clean the seagull crap off you deck. The leveling system may have a rather large learning curve but it too, is quite sophisticated and well thought through.Now, the hard part...Combat. for most players, your first hour will mainly consist of repeatedly getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed too you by an oyster or a cute little chicken, (By the way the animation for killing those feathery sons-a-♥♥♥♥♥es is extremly satisfying, as with every other death animation, even when your precious captain dies a wonderstruck sense of awe hits you like a♥♥♥♥♥♥covered brick to the face.) I will admit it is a little bit unpolished, but I see the potential in it. As of right now it isnt the easiest to handle, (My stategy is buying every crew member I can find and then rushing in and hope one of them is still alive after.) But nevertheless it shows unprecidentable promise. (I really hope i spelt that right and used it correctly in the right context.)...(I has bad englishes)So in short, This game is Amazing and buy it right now, support the developers and help them make it better... Its worth it.All the best game playening,      DelusionalKitty			"

Early Access Review
								As one of the first 10 voters on greenlight and one of the first to try the demo and experience the full steam early access version, I thought it was only right to write a review giving my deepest and most precise thoughts on the game. So no more jibber-jatter, lets start reviewing.Pixel Piracy is a sidescrolling 2D Pirate Simulator, yes, simulator. The words might be a shock to you as the game looks very, very silly and cute, however it precisely simulates how pirates were in the 1800's, because, of course we all know pirates had floating ships, no sails, and of course, submarines and poles out of wood. Becides that, though, the game is very realistic in terms of the hardcore (No respawn) and fighting and survival aspects of the game. Food, weapons, money, salaries, are all active needs for you and your crew to survive on these great seas. You can make your own ships block by block from what you buy at shops, you can plunder enemy ships, and islands, take there ships. And even buy rum to really get the feeling of piracy. Taking slaves and prisoners is an upcoming feature I am really looking forward too. The game is in real time, and is single player. AT-THE-MOMENT. They have promised a multiplayer (No info on that yet) upon release, which I am very excited to see how it's all peaced together!Rate: 8.7/10. (This may change depending on updates)---(No need to read this)If you guys like my reviews or anything please be sure to follow me around and check out my other reviews on games like Door Kickers, DayZ, etc. I'm not much a diehard fan for any game so most if not all my reviews are completely honest, and thanks for reading, feel free for feedback and rate!---			"

												Regardless of how I present it,  this game is actually awesome...  But It feels like it needs ""A LOT OF WORK"" still...-  ""I HOPE YOU LIKE POOP"".  This games litterally full of♥♥♥♥♥♥  And cleaning it up/preventing it,  is at the worst of times near impossible.-  AI can get annoying,  As the pirates refuse to do their jobs at times(cleaning,  fishing,  even cannoneering),  awkward fights occured where a pirate wouldn't attack for whatever reason while getting stabbed,  And watching my own cannoneers blow up my boarders...  And yes,  my morale was green and they weren't doing their jobs...-  It feels incomplete,  or just somewhat undone in some area's.  I never saw a single sea monster only islands and pirate ships,  Morale and hunger are a whacky rollercoaster thats near uncontrollable at times when the cleaning isn't getting done and they got to drink rum to cheer up,  causing a need for MORE CLEANING,  And the game didn't even recognize the female pirates...(it felt a little odd).Overall,  I DO Recommend the game As building a ship and watching glorious battles is endlessly fun...  But the experience is still far from perfect...			"

												Pixel Piracy was not exactly a game that I was looking for, but after picking it up, it definitely surprised me in how fun the game actually was. Graphically, the game is quite charming. Gameplay itself is an interesting mix of hands on and hands off. And the sandbox-esque way of creating your ship is quite lovely. The audio is a bit more of a mixed front for me than others, but all in all, positive.When it comes to how the game looks, Pixel Piracy is very much a retro throwback indy title. It's filled with lots of lovely blocky pixels, and really has that old school charm to it. If you are a fan of the low res, chunky looking games, the art alone just might sell Pixel Piracy to you. The only visuals that seem a bit mismatched and out of place are the sails and the sea itself. While every other bit of Pixel Piracy is nice and blocky, the sails and the water look more modern, and it can be a bit offputting.The gameplay of Pixel Piracy is wonderful! It is an interesting merger between a god game, and a game with a bit finer tuned controls. With the exception of more absolute control over the captain of your ship, most of the sailors go about their business as they please. (Particularly if they are unhappy!) Unless you select the ship group the sailor is directly associated with, getting them to move where you want is impossible. It can be a bit frusturating at first, but it really spices up the gameplay when you're trying your best to keep newer shipmates alive during a wild brawl amid decks!Pixel Piracy has the appeal that most sandbox games have. Do what you want, when you want, and the way you want. Moving up from a dinky little boat to a massive customized warship takes time, but finally getting there really feels rewarding! Building up a ship from scratch and using it to mow down lower tiered pirate ships is just a great feeling.The audio in Pixel Piracy is the one area that may need a bit of work. The shanties are funny, but limited. The sound effects in general are quite fitting to the game, to be completely fair. The real issue is how sailors will begin to have a ""conversation"" onboard your ship, which basically just results in them filling your ears with ""Yo ho!"", ""Dead men tell no tales"", ""Blow the man down"", and ""Shiver me timbers!"" over and over and over again. It was funny at first, but as the game progresses it does begin to wear on you a bit.Overall Pixel Piracy is a GREAT game! Sailing around the world, sinking the ships of your unworthy foes, and conquering islands gives the game a lot of replay value.  8.5/10			"

												This game is fun but hard if rushed into, making you have to take it slow, this is a real downside to the game. When you start the game you will struggle for money and very little can be found on small ships, but if you go for the bigger ships early on, you WILL die, so you have to upgrade, buying crewmates, weapons, building materials, all of this takes money, money that you dont have and that you cant get because you have to plunder small ships and abandoned islands. The rest of the game is great, but it just takes too long to get there.			"

												This is a darn cotton pick'n good game. The learning curve is steep as there are not really any complete instructions. Its a lot of testing out things. There are a few things that are in game but are presently useless until the next update. However, this game is sick. I get to pirate pixels with out breaking copyright laws!Basically you start out answering a series of questions which tailor your game experience, which are questions about your past and the world around you. You must plunder or take a prize from pirates around your skill level or less unless your up for some random chance at glory and risk dying a bloody ugly death. As you train your mates, it seems that the trick is stacking early intelligence on about 5 pirates, outfitting them with jobs from your home island. No starter pirate seems to know how to clean his own crap up much less do anything worth while like fish, you have to LEARN em good. That costs money. You can train pets, when your attacked they will defend you if your boarded. Its actually really addicting, though I am reaching my limit and at this point the replay value would only be upped by new features.  "

You either have Satin 1, Satin 2 or Chipmunks. Another thing is that your crew is ALWAYS talking to each other both outloud and a chat bar over their heads. The reason I hate the chat bar is because 90% of the things they say are from Pirates Of The Carribbean and the rest of it is stuff like ""your my favorite pirate"" and ""next drink is on me"" and ""let's plunder"". Second thing is how stereotypical this game is. Remember when you were in like 4th grade learning about pirates but they never talked about the graphic stuff? That's what this game is, except for when someone dies and ther torso goes flying 10 feet away with a crappy trail of blood in one of the most unrealistic ways I have ever seen in a game. It seems like the only things the Devs know about pirates comes from Pirates Of The Carribbean and learning about them in fourth grade. Most people buy this game because they think it's a Pirate version of Terrarria, it's not that at all. I don't want to be too harsh but I also want to tell you not to buy this game.			"

								I fed my crew watermelons. We ran out of food on the second day. They did number two all over the ship (raft) whilst random seagulls did number two all over the ship (raft) as well. They both got angry at how unclean the ship (raft) was, and committed mutiny and killed the captain (me) on the first island.10/10.			"

Early Access Review
								First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/pixel-piracy-first-impressions/Yes, a pirate simulator. Pixel Piracy is a pirate simulator. Now, who wouldn’t want to try out a pirate simulator?It may sound fun, but it is really, really hard. The game also has permadeath, which just adds to the fun, well, if you’re good at the game at least. You’ll need to start by building a ship and, optionally, hiring a someone to be on your crew. The crew system is a bit annoying, because oftentimes the crew will just ignore your orders because they lack loyalty. Loyalty can be gained by paying them in gold, the game’s currency.The game’s shipbuilding is a bit weird. My first ship looked like a block, but it still worked. In fact, all of the early game enemies also had terrible-looking ships, just like mine. Later in the game, you’ll get to build cooler ships, assuming you don’t die along the way. I’ve yet to get far enough to build a really fancy ship, so I’ll just stick with my floating blocks of wood for now. Pixel Piracy also has an RPG element to go along with it. It’s rather complex, but adds a lot to the game and I really enjoy its addition.Early-game, I had a lot of trouble with combat. I was terrible at it. The combat is really unpredictable, there is little to no indication of whether or not you will win a fight. With more crewmates, however, the chances of winning in combat rise immensely, especially when you’ve got six or so guys and they got three. The combat could be better, but the game is in early access, so changes could be made along the way.Although the game is difficult, I find enjoyment in it anyways. I’ll get better at it as I play, for sure.			"

												Pretty good game. When I first got this game I got off to a rocky start... I could kill other pirates but I didn't know how to get blocks for a ship. At first i thought you had to capture the ship. Nope it was ""PLUNDER"". My main problems with this game iare that the green ""HELP"" menu is HORRIBLE. ""okay how do i get people to be my crew?""

Everything that was bad has been fixed and little bugs just make the game even more worth while. People can come and go saying that this game is ""un finished"" or ""a grindy game"" but to me its all for the laughs. I named my pirates after a kid shows called Jake and the Neverland Pirates. Which just made the game a whole lot more fun. I can keep making files of this game and will never end. So to finish it off just to seal the deal its made by Re-Logic.

												THIS GAME IS NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE SAY!!!...  Sorry I just had to get that out there. Pixel Piracy is not a horrible game, and it certainly is not abandon because they released a update on the 30th of march! The game features no totorial other that the basic controls, this does NOT help the game because people start the game, get lost in its frustrating overly-complex menus and ui, then quit and uninstall it. But if you can get passed that and learn what to do and how to properly play the game, you will have fun. Aside from that the game is buggy but the devs are working on that, so cut them some slack, if it is still super buggy after the enhanced edition is released then there is a problem. To sum things up the game was released way too early, its very hard to start off unless you look stuff up online and read the F1 help menu and it needs a little more work. But if you are looking for a fun Rougelite with pirate theme then this is what you want. I have enjoyed  this game every minute I sank in, and it is worth it if you want a RPG Pirate game.			"

												In Pixel Piracy you play the role of a dashing pirate of your own make. You can choose parts of your history, but what it really comes down to is your infinite hatred for poop. Left on his/her own with a boat in a land where everyone has been cursed to poop at any given moment for no reason and no matter where they are, it is up to you to establish the greatest poop cleaning ship in all the land.Our hero must go to great lengths to train his/her crew in the art of poop cleaning or even improving their skill at controlling their poop. Aside from the awesome storyline, the player is left with a lot of moral decisions like, do you go all genocide on the natives on some island just in case there might be a cleaning training book on the island? Do you attack the boat that is minding it's own business for the same reason plus a chance at taking a ship that might have more space for poop clearing facilities?If taking ships doesn't shiver your timbers, you can also build your ship up to your liking. There's a lot of value in building the ultimate ship for combatting the poop menace.All of that aside, here are some other miscellaneous features of the game that haven't been discussed above:-Have your crew poop on the enemy ship!-Watch your crew poop mid-combat!-Hire awesome warriors to defend your poop cleaning guys. (The latter are the real heros)-Defeat four major pirate bosses to distract yourself from the real war. (Talking about the war on poop)-Keep the poopdeck clean, have your men and women wear diapers!-Bras increase morale!-Mount cannons and swivel guns onto your ship and shoot at stuff! (Mounted weapons can't shoot poop though)-Be a badass!-Ignore the war on poop and watch morale drop like poop in a vacuum!-Pirate stuff! (Not really a major feature, it's more about the poop) -Scurvy!10/10 Would die of scurvy aboard a shop covered in poop again. "

It does get really hard to manage late game with a big crew and all of them pooping and eating and costing you money while you still have to manage their weapons and consumables and abilities individually. Early on though, that's where the real fun is. Set off with yer manageable crew and kill manageable pirates whith crewmembers you actually value because you've invested so much in them, only to have them drown because they were stabbed while ziplining over to the enemy ship. Very sad times... but very fun times too. It's like an RPG but also a real time strategy but also a sandbox but also a cry your eyes out when your captain doesn't know how to swim and gets knocked into the water.			"

												I got this game from the Humble Bundle so I cant complain, however, I am going to. I started up the game and a small pirate started screaming at me. I did not know how to please the pirate and stop it's whining so I sat there in confusion as my ear drums shattered. I cleaned the blood from my ears and thought, hey, lets give it another go. I made a pirate and answered some questions and then I was on an island. From here I could click things and talk to pirates. However, as I became deaf I could only read the 50mph subtitles which gave me eye strain. I persevered to find that I was meant to attack another pirate ship, so, after 10 minutes of confusion I found my ship. From here I could not do anything but get pooed on by several seaguls and I got two achievements for this. At this point I was physically trembling, a seizure had set in and my limbs were not my own. The last thing I remebered was waking up in a hospital. When I awoke I was told by a doctor I had every single STD and 3 months to live, (I think I was anyway because I have bad tinitus from the screaming pirate), so I took the time to warn others of this. Overall 4/10, got me out the house			"

												It was fun for an hour or so, but it kind of got boring fast. The thing about the game is it has potentional, if you maybe changed the battle system, made it so you don't consantly have to feed and pay your crew, and a more detailed campaign instead of just fighting other pirates and stuff.

												Until some of the game-breaking bugs like failed grapples, unresponsive crew members and cannons not firing are fixed, this game is more frustration than enjoyment.That's not even mentioning frustrating mechanics like the 'bully' perk which can decimate your crew and makes certain pirates unhirable, the rather boring difficulty curve, poorly implemented animals, a frustrating food/morale/poop mechanic, and many many things besides.I do not recommend, as of 31/12/2014			"

												One of the worst games I have ever played. First thing is sound, There is only 3 diffrent crew voices. Normally this wouldn't bother me except for the fact that your crew never shuts up. You either have Satin 1, Satin 2 or Chipmunks. Another thing is that your crew is ALWAYS talking to each other both outloud and a chat bar over their heads. The reason I hate the chat bar is because 90% of the things they say are from Pirates Of The Carribbean and the rest of it is stuff like ""your my favorite pirate"" and ""next drink is on me"" and ""let's plunder"". Second thing is how stereotypical this game is. Remember when you were in like 4th grade learning about pirates but they never talked about the graphic stuff? That's what this game is, except for when someone dies and ther torso goes flying 10 feet away with a crappy trail of blood in one of the most unrealistic ways I have ever seen in a game. It seems like the only things the Devs know about pirates comes from Pirates Of The Carribbean and learning about them in fourth grade. Most people buy this game because they think it's a Pirate version of Terrarria, it's not that at all. I don't want to be too harsh but I also want to tell you not to buy this game.			"

												This is a darn cotton pick'n good game. The learning curve is steep as there are not really any complete instructions. Its a lot of testing out things. There are a few things that are in game but are presently useless until the next update. However, this game is sick. I get to pirate pixels with out breaking copyright laws!Basically you start out answering a series of questions which tailor your game experience, which are questions about your past and the world around you. You must plunder or take a prize from pirates around your skill level or less unless your up for some random chance at glory and risk dying a bloody ugly death. As you train your mates, it seems that the trick is stacking early intelligence on about 5 pirates, outfitting them with jobs from your home island. No starter pirate seems to know how to clean his own crap up much less do anything worth while like fish, you have to LEARN em good. That costs money. You can train pets, when your attacked they will defend you if your boarded. Its actually really addicting, though I am reaching my limit and at this point the replay value would only be upped by new features.  "

My favourite is the 'Crew can't reach here' bug that stops you from being able to sail anywhere, ever. A close second is the one when your save file gets wiped for no reason. This is a fun game when it works, but can you be bothered spending half an hour doing that?			"

												A cute idea hampered by horrible implementation and a startling lack of polish all combine into an awful game. Let's take it apart, piece by piece-Graphics(3/10)- Obviously one of the first things you'll notice about the game, Pixel Piracy falls pretty flat here. First off, the entire game is smothered in a layer of bloom that adjusting the game's graphics settings seems to do nothing to lessen. I'm fairly certain there are only two backgrounds in the entire game, one for land, and one for sea, and neither are very interesting. And while there's not really anything wrong with the actual visual game elements, it looks like the sort of pixel style that is not done to deliberately invoke a retro or indie feel, but one that comes of a developer who is either very lazy or very short on funds. The characters are ugly, the items are unrecognizable, and the game world is just incredibly samey. So, in short, while it's not physically painful to look at, that's really the best I can say of it, and even that's not true sometimes.Sound(1/10)- Jesus god in heaven help me. If you can play this for more than a minute with the sound on, you are a stronger person than I will ever be. The game's bgm consists of 4, maybe five, tracks that are nothing but 30-45 second loops of the most utterly uninspired MIDI music you can imagine. Incredibly, that's the good part of the sound design, because all the effects are even worse. The general game sound effects are repetitive and aggravating, but they pale in comparison to the game's voice clips. Every different character in this game is assigned one of an astoundingly large number of 2 second clips of what I can only assume are people the devs pulled off the street to read Klingon backwards into 50 year old microphones. And the game is really proud of them, so it plays one for you every time ANYTHING happens, which equates to about 6000 times on every single sailing voyage you take. Maybe that's not enough for you? How about ""sea shanties""? By which I mean another awful MIDI track under a tinny voice that makes me want to poke my eardrums out crooning some hilariously cringeworthy g-rated pirate themed lyrics. Because that's what this game has to offer. You get the picture. I hope you get the picture. Please don't make me talk about the game's sound anymore.Story(Not even really applicable/10)- There isn't any. That's it. Probaby better that way, to be honest. Moving on.Gameplay(2/10)- This section is depressingly similar to the last one. The ""gameplay"" can really be divided into three categories: preparing to do stuff, doing stuff, and waiting for the stuff you've done to happen. The preparing to do stuff is probably where you'll spend a majority of the game. This accounts for all time spent in shops and menus and stat screens. this is where you hire crew members and buy weapons and upgrade your ship and teach your crew how to poop properly (no, really). This is the closest the game the game comes to being fun, but it would come a lot closer if any of this crap I've mentioned ACTUALLY WORKED. This game legitmately has the least intuitive and most perplexing UI I've ever encountered. Equipment screens are confusing, skills are absurd, and whoever thought doing 90% of all in-game actions from a pause screen was a good idea really oughta be killed. But once you've emerged from the menu maze you get the tremendous pleasure of ...*wait for it*... clicking. That's it. That's all you really get to do. You click. To attack or to move or to dig or to plunder, you click. Once. Maybe twice. And then you wait. Absolutely NOTHING in this game is in a hurry. Sailing is slow, your crew moves slow, scroling the camera is slow. And then, once you're done waiting, head back to the menus. I am in no way exaggerating when I say that's all there is to the game. That's literally it. And don't think for a second that there are a variety of environements to explore. You've got your towns, your deserted islands, your open sea, and your ship battles. Once again, no exaggeration. That's it. And I'm really not kidding about this game's bizarre obsession with poop. There are a myriad of skills, items, and acheivements relating to fecal matter. Kind fitting really.So, wouldn't it be nice to have a game where you could design your own captain and build your own ship and mold your own crew and sail the open seas to find treaure, love, and destiny? You better believe it would. Is that game Pixel Piracy? No. No it is not.2/10, incredibly disappointing, do not purchase.			"

												Perhaps one of the most boring, and unprofessional games I have ever played.  If you're having trouble falling asleep at night and don't own Unepic, buy this game and play some pixel piracy.  It sure puts me to sleep.Edit: 2015, July 20th.   I've tried once again to get into the game and see what's what in it, and I've encountered numerous bugs; all of which have been reported and have had devs reply to; most of which back in 2014.  The devs seemed to have a tendency of replying once saying something along the lines of: ""It is working"", then never getting back to the poster when they say it's not working.  And now they're releasing a sequel to the game with the same concept except in space, someone earlier called the game a scam; and I am starting to agree with that sentiment.There is no animating done, at all in the game.  I'm not an animation expert myself but I can at least make a walk, talk, and attack animations in only a few hours; the extent of noticable animation you'll get in Pixel piracy is your character moving slightly.Then there's the voice system; all the voices feel like the devs asked some random kids ""Hey; say something piratey""; and it really gets annoying after a while of them just saying the same things over and over again.  The character traits and professions seem to be completely pointless and serve as just eyecandy; the type of world seems to have no real effect on things, the interface doesn't work very properly and you'll occasionally get a blank screen forcing you to restart the game.Overall I'd say this game is probably worth a dollar on the android market; but does not belong on any sort of Windows store, let alone for the price they're asking for.  And I still agree with my original thought all that time back;  this is perhaps one of the most boring, unprofessional games I've ever seen.  The formula is simply: Go to random square, either land on island, shop, or combat.  If you land on island, reopen map and go to another square, if you land on shop, see about getting new units, or upgrading them, if you land on combat, left and right click enemy ship, wait, then left/right click your ship, wait, and click plunder button; and repeat.  Oh, i also forgot to mention all the waiting between each block while your ship is ""sailing"".It's funny, I bought this game on April 1st from a bundle for a dollar; it sort of feels like a joke of them to even have it.  I rate this game a 2/10; it is a waste of time, it's not good, it's not awefull, it's just a black whole sucking in all the potential entertainment you could have watching paint dry instead.			"

												Do what you want cause a pirate is free!! YOU ARE A MICROMANAGER....So bitterly disappointed,  a good chunk of your time later on is spent managing rum and food stores. I've just spent the last few hours trying to get a balance between crew size and resources. Exploring is hard when you need to dock or get resources for your men every few minutes (I'm playing on Easy too). The combat is non existent too, you just click a location and watch. It's a shame as the game has a charm about it but it's too flabby and overweight. I often judge games by how much ""fun"" time there is per ""play"" time. This one actually decreases as you play :-(Trying to palm off a Alpha build as a full 1.0 retail... Appalling.			"

												The premise was promising: Terraria meets Sid Meier's Pirates, what could possibly go wrong?Well, a lot apparently.Right off the bat, the first problem I have is that I have no flipping clue what I'm doing. Nevermind all the arrs, the ""tutorial"" is hardly useful besides keeping you from dying before you even set sail. The interface is never explained in any notable detail, and the interface itself is unintuitive and badly designed. I still don't know how I'm supposed to save the game, even though the Exit Game button reminds me to, besides clicking that Exit Game button to force an autosave.The gameplay is also really really lacking. The premise of Terraria? No, not really. It's far better to capture better ships than to build your own, and unlike Terraria the interface just doesn't stimulate creativity. But what about the pirating, you ask? Nah, it's basically get some levels in the earlygame and then you're set; just tank the enemy ship if cannons are present and then just board with everyone and just win with sheer numbers. Same for islands, just with no cannons.Overall very disappointed. Was it worth the $1.49 I paid for because this was on sale? Maybe, I did spend a little under 5 hours on it. 32 cents per hour of entertainment? Meh, at least I didn't lose much.TL;DR: Boring, bad interface, only go for it if it's on sale and you are really interested.			"

												As soon as I saw the developer's name, I SHOULD have thought twice about buying this game but I loved the idea so much I bought it anyway when it first came out.Basically, the game has not changed since launch and by change I mean ""it hasn't been completed."" ... Just like all his other games. It's a great tech demo in a long line of tech demos that never get finished. There's plenty of balance issues, the UI breaks down as you try and keep up with the non-stop micromanagement. You can die for completely B.S. reasons (bugs) and lose everything. Worst of all, the game just stops being fun after the novelty wears off. He never added anything more to do. Your experience never grows. The first 30 minutes of gameplay is the same as the last 30 minutes of gameplay as you become so bored and frustated you just stop playing.This is the last time I give this guy money. I've learned my lesson.			"

This review is for version 0.6.5 BETAPixel Piracy holds much potential, that's what I wanted to say first. However, the game is currently in beta and it is far from completed. The interface is rather confusing and there are game-breaking bugs which only a restart and reload of an old save will solve. The game balance is very off, especially when the AI can easily be defeated by a single person. You can beat an army of enemies with just your captain by  pausing the game and use the move&attack button on an enemy. The AI will stop doing whatever they were doing for a short while after you issued the command. In this way, you can hit an enemy, pause the game, give a new order and watch your captain slaughter all enemies without them fighting back. There are several other annoyances, such as missing scroll bars if you collected many items, and the weird interface for your crew, as well as poop. So much poop on your ship! Pirates need to eliminate from time to time and will do so on your ship. You can teach your people to clean, but for some reason, the cleaning rate is lower than pooping rate, so you will end up having a ship full of poop.Nevertheless, I can not only list the bad stuff, can I? I love the art/graphic style. It's simple, yes, but it's very beautiful. I also like the sound and the smooth animations and transitions of the interface. The game's core concept is great, I want to play this, just explore one more island and fight one more legendary boss. But right now, there is little to be explored. I hope they will add much content (or modding support?). All in all, I had and still have fun with this game, even in the current state, so I can recommend this game to people who want to support the developers and can take a peek into the game, but not to people who want to have a finished game.

								Pixel Piracy...It can be super annoying sometimes to get to an amazingly easy to defeat island, when all of a sudden your highest leveled character decides he doesn't know how to use a rope and falls into the ocean. But that's all part of this game. It's the most fun I've ever had on a roguelike game, and that's not usually something I say about the genre. It could be because this one is a lot more forgiving than other games like it as it has a save feature before traveling. While this game is still in developement, I still really enjoy all of the current aspects of it, and look forward to seeing what comes in the future.7/10 which is damn good for a game in alpha.			"

								Pixel Piracy is a pretty fun little game that is sure to entertain you for a few hours at least. While it could use some more polish and some of the interfacing could be a little better, it is not a complete game. You can build a pirate ship, starting from a few free blocks, and basically it's a pirate sim from there. Start from boarding other small crafts to shooting cannons from your gigantic ship. There is a few things to keep track of though and time management is also a factor. It's really a hard game and you will surely lose a lot when you first start but you learn what to do different every time. After it's updated, I'm sure I will be able to say that Pixel Piracy is one of my favorite indie games out there.			"

If you are having a hard time just visit us in the community page and look at guides videos and more I'm sure you will find what you need and remember ""Dead men tell no tales!""Things to point out about Pixel Piracy:1. It is in early alpha. There will be balance issues and bugs! The developers are working very hard on fixing the issues. (More than you can say for some games.)2. This game is very addicting. Even when you die and lose all your progress in hardcore mode you just want to make a new pirate and try again!.3. A new princess mode is now available to play. When you die you can reload your last save.4. an amazing amount of content has been released so far and i am sure more will come!5. Don't let the fact that this game is in alpha bother you take it with a grain of salt report your issues in the community page so everyone benefits and keep on playing!			"

												As far as I played Pixel Piracy, I can honestly say that it is a well made game. Fresh looks and a obviously Piracy related humour keep the fun levels high. It's way more than a poop game (a game you'd play while you... well you know ;) ) neither it is a fulltime gaming experience. A well drawn timefiller as I'd describe it. The Pirates you hire are never shut the hell up, so be aware of that, take it with humour or adjust the SFX of that :D I found it quite hard to get the hang of Pixel Piracy, as the base difficulty is 'kindly hard' when you first start. As like most well done indiegames, you actually have to spend a reasonable amount of time into learing the mechanics of the game. This is actually not a bad thing to point out at all. So if you're into Pirates and Indiegames, you definately should check it out!			"

												It's an indie game. I don't even know why I bought this. No seriously, I don't. At the moment, the game feels too repetitive. Pick up a few salty dogs, sail over to some other guys ship, kill them. Is the ship better? Take it. Is it worse? Blow it up. Then go to a town, buy more guys to kill tougher ships in order to steal them/blow them up. And it goes on and on. You can see how repetitive it is, right? In short, don't buy unless you're really into pirates, or something.			"

												I spent most of my time sailing or micro-managing my pirate crew's stats, abilities, and equipment.There is little variety to the locations you can visit. There's a little randomness to the shape and colors of the enemy ships, the arrangement of the town buildings, and the backround on the jungle islands, but that's it.When I was tired of micro-managing my crew, I became bored with the game.Fun for a bit, not a lot of depth.

												The premise was promising: Terraria meets Sid Meier's Pirates, what could possibly go wrong?Well, a lot apparently.Right off the bat, the first problem I have is that I have no flipping clue what I'm doing. Nevermind all the arrs, the ""tutorial"" is hardly useful besides keeping you from dying before you even set sail. The interface is never explained in any notable detail, and the interface itself is unintuitive and badly designed. I still don't know how I'm supposed to save the game, even though the Exit Game button reminds me to, besides clicking that Exit Game button to force an autosave.The gameplay is also really really lacking. The premise of Terraria? No, not really. It's far better to capture better ships than to build your own, and unlike Terraria the interface just doesn't stimulate creativity. But what about the pirating, you ask? Nah, it's basically get some levels in the earlygame and then you're set; just tank the enemy ship if cannons are present and then just board with everyone and just win with sheer numbers. Same for islands, just with no cannons.Overall very disappointed. Was it worth the $1.49 I paid for because this was on sale? Maybe, I did spend a little under 5 hours on it. 32 cents per hour of entertainment? Meh, at least I didn't lose much.TL;DR: Boring, bad interface, only go for it if it's on sale and you are really interested.			"

												As soon as I saw the developer's name, I SHOULD have thought twice about buying this game but I loved the idea so much I bought it anyway when it first came out.Basically, the game has not changed since launch and by change I mean ""it hasn't been completed."" ... Just like all his other games. It's a great tech demo in a long line of tech demos that never get finished. There's plenty of balance issues, the UI breaks down as you try and keep up with the non-stop micromanagement. You can die for completely B.S. reasons (bugs) and lose everything. Worst of all, the game just stops being fun after the novelty wears off. He never added anything more to do. Your experience never grows. The first 30 minutes of gameplay is the same as the last 30 minutes of gameplay as you become so bored and frustated you just stop playing.This is the last time I give this guy money. I've learned my lesson.			"

												This game is one the few cases where I have felt buyer's remorse. Do not buy it, not if it's on sale, not even if you have some coupon, just don't. The combat is wonky and a drag to watch, and doesn't bother to teach you any of the game mechanics. The game also has some really weird filter on it that makes it look weird. (but that's more personal preference) The crew AI is horrendous, and often take a couple seconds to respond to commands, and when you're fighting enemy ships, it can end up screwing you over a ton. All islands are identical, and often the only thing different is what enemies are on them. Same goes for towns, they are all similar. Don't do it, if you were to use the money that this game costed to buy a fork, and then stabbed your self in the cheek with said fork, it would be more worth it than buying this game. ♥♥♥♥ you Bixel Biracy			"

												This game, has very BIG performance issues.I think developers should understand that, and they should understand it very clearly that even a small mistake on the code / programming architecture returns SO MANY users as a loss of time.Skyrim loads on 10 secs, this game needs 1:45 secs to get to the next square on level 3 sized boat and lowest resolution on lowest opengl graphics!As you can see i forced my chances to finish the game, even played it on worse than amiga graphics lowest resolution (with unreadable texts, duh) but it was atill a nightmare; I dont know maybe because save file started to get fat.I really like simple graphics games, and this game has really nice visuality. Those forests, animals, exaggerated painful death voices... So far so good. But black screens and texts really gives the feeling that development phase interrupted early. But they made some changes to the game and released as single player...When you have big lists of something, anything; this game starts to fk up. And by big lists i mean 20+ or so, sadly. This list can be items put on boat / items on inventory / number of pirates / treasures shown on map or even visited places on map or shop list changes from the initial game. You can easily test this by trying to sell your weapons, having more than 1 page of weapons. It tries to draw everything again or something. Or did they define everthing as 3D? These mistakes are easy to spot, as being very beginner level.You can be sure that Unity offers many solutions when it comes to performance. While these are happening on devs' territory, what was the Valve's side of the story again? They could put more clear performance restrictions, no?I think devs should hire an expert, pay him whatever he wants, then apologize from the players and release an update. This is the best thing to do for the both parties. They could really make some money with this game, it has cute sides. Or they could just leave the fixing and make it free.			"

												It's incredibly difficult to understand what's going on and why. For example, the way you'll find out about the Scurvy mechanic is when your entire first expedition dies to it. There's an Interact button, God alone knows why it's not the left mouse button, but you'll be standing in front of a chest like a moron and using Google to figure it out. There are Pets, but aside from Chickens (who lay eggs) and Crabs and Parrots (who attack) there doesn't appear to be a reason to keep the poop machines aboard. Speaking of poop, fully a third of your crew will be devoted to cleaning it off your ship. And if you'd like people to fish while you're at sea or your captain to dig while on shore, or anyone to capture animals, you'd better be prepared to enter the very klunky interface to change their weapons, as there's no way to carry fishing poles, animal traps, or shovels without them being one of your two primary weapons.There's a good game here, somewhere, but it's only a small step closer to usability than Dwarf Fortress and not nearly as entertaining.

												Truth be told this is a bad game. You're crew doesn't know how to swim and drown half the time. You die to everything nearby unless you decide to travel a lot and the final bosses are hard and very far away. BUT there is hope. There is nothing more satifying than using cheat engine on this game and watch your captain slaughter an entire pirate ship and then blowing it up. I say if they give you an unfair game, play it in an unfair way. You can make crew member anything you want, maxing out thier health, but not thier damage and watch as they just tank out an entire fight. This is a hard game to play seriously due to it's flaws, but for some laughs and pirate music, why not enjoy it? For $2-10 it's a cheap price to pay for a small, but enjoyable game.			"

								This is really early alpha opinions.You're a captain, and you pirate pixels, you use said pixels(gold) to hire (hopefully) able crew that can learn all sorts of skills, the game contains good old rpg mechanics, meaning when you level up you gain abilitypoints to put into whatever stat you want. You can also learn new skills in different towns that you visit (protip: learn cleaning). Ship construction, you can build your own 2d pirateship with cannons and beds and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Devs have said they're going to add plenty of things to do in the game, like managing your own pirate hideout.I rate it 4 out of 5 loud ducks.

								My addiction is high with this one. I got it and I instantly played it for like 3 hours. Learnt the controls and what not. Its SO much fun :D! Ok. Your a pirate. Out to get 'booty', a crew, food and booty. Along the way there are problems like unhappy crew, enemies on land and water, and money shortages. This game gets a 9/10 from me. I dont know what it is but its one of those games you play for a little bit, decide to take a break in 10 minutes, but 2 hours later you havent taken your eyes off it. It has a slight repeating factor to it, but it helps it. Most of the money and food I get is from enemy ships after I plunder them. I always like starting off with a first mate, just because you arent alone in the beginning. Then I really come to like the first crew guy ( mainly because they have a low pay-requirement ) and I tend to teach them EVERYTHING. If you can manage to get to guns and cannons and having a big crew with an even bigger ship, you can make it pretty far. In all honesty, im taking my time. I have played for 10 hours but im only at pirates with lvl 4 difficulty. You learn from mistakes, and the saving system is nice. I have little complaints. I really want to catch parrots and animals and slaves, but apparently thats not a feature yet even though the provide the requirements. Thats a little pet peeve of mine I guess. Your given things you cant get to without patience. But I know those are going to be provided in later updates ( Note : It updates often ). This is definetly a must try and I would gladly recommend it.			"

												Starting off, I do really like this game. I'd give it a 6/10. I played enough of it to gauge how it plays, and overall it is quite an enjoyable experience. It is one of those games that you could play for hours and not even notice how the time flies. ""So why not a better score?"" you may ask. For a few reasons. 1. The GUI     The menu is one of those that feels like it should be super smooth but isn't. While most of the time it is intuitive, some parts of it are very hard to inderstand, like how there is no ""back"" button after selecting a crewmember (or maybe I'm blind). It can also feel a bit clunky when it takes a second or two to load the Map.2. The Graphics     Yes, they're there. Yes, they're pixely. Yes, there is only one backround for big islands and one for the sea. Players want something interesting to look at while they decapitate turtles named Charlie, and a repeating forest tile isn't interesting.3. The Gameplay     The other stuff has been superficial, so lemme divide this a bit more:          a. Controlling Pirates               It's really wonky. There is barely any tutorialization with it (along with almost every other part of the game) and even then it sometimes doesn't do what one would want it to. If there was an actual tutorial in the game, it would fix a lot of its glaring problems.          b. Areas               There is next to no variation. There are Pirate encounters, Island encounters, and Towns. Islands are boring and give very little gold, Pirates are either super easy or super hard---there is no middle ground, and Towns sometimes don't give you what you want (I'm still looking for the end of my Bowstrip). With more, different areas, this game would be a thousand times better.          c. Sailing               Now I know this is gonna ruffle your feathers, but I actually like the ""loading"" aspect of the game. It adds charm. What I do not like, however, is what takes place while sailing. Nothing. Aside from a sea shanty or the sharpening of a blade on my grindstone, nothing happens. Again, no variety. All I see is the health tick up and hunger and moral tick down. If something were to happen of if my pirates would ACTUALLY CLEAN THAT♥♥♥♥♥♥OFF THE♥♥♥♥♥♥DECK then it would be a thouroughly enjoyable experience.So why a 6/10? The game sounds terrible! Nay, my friend, I love it. It is incredible addicting, almost a pokemon-esque type of feel. It's like I need to play, or I will die. And don't let that ""time played= 4 hours"" fool you. I played much more than that offline. Oh, and my ship is more beautiful than yours.If you like rouguelikes, non-story-driven RPG's, or evenarcade games, then Pixel piracy is for you. Plus, the dev is a cool dude. TL:DR: 6/10 but could be a 10/10P.S. Alex, I know you read every review, so I'd like to say a few things. Keep up the good work, and i left a message in that chat room that you said to PM you in. Cheers mate! ¡Dinero!			"

								""Heya there matey, ye shivers me timbers!"" that is pretty much it.Now for real, this game is not for children, it is unforgiving, it is tactical, you have to take care of quite a lot aspects of your crew and ship management, and THE MOST important thing - your deck will often get pooped on.The biggest suprise for me was that this is not at all like Terraria or Starbound, you do not control your own character in a smash and hit way, it is much more like the old awesome ""point and click rpgs"" (like Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale etc.). You control your captain and your crew by commands using just your mouse. But strangely enough how it is, it is not a flaw at all.I did not think that Pixel Piracy was so great. But to tell the truth this game is really one of the best I have played in a long time. It really can suck you in so easily, that you wont even know when to stop. Since you chop your first enemy in a half, youll be in pirate game heaven.10/10 and still improving !			"

												This is a pretty good game (with quite a few bugs...)The good:1. Build your own ship,  You can make big ships that you can design 100% completely as you wish.2. Hire a huge crew,  In games like this with crew you can get i.e FTL (great game also recommend) you have a small crewin Pixel Piracy you can have a massive crew of over 20 people,  You can level them up teach them ect ect3.  A huge map with many encounters,  The encounters in the game can be islands towns ships and legendary ships (from what I have found)4.  Cheats!  If you want a more easy going sandbox mod you can use cheats to give you XP, Food, Moral, health, crew, money,  And rain thousands of cannon balls on your enemies.The bad:1 Glitches!  20 minutes in I ran into a glitch that stopped me from doing anything on that run.2 The controls,  Not the best in a game there not the worst but are hard and confusing to learn how to control everything3 The ""Tutorial""  When you start you just get thrown in...  You can click ""Help"" and get some help but the explanation is not well done and leave you confused.4 Spelling!  I'm not the best speller ever i.e ^ but there is quite a few mistakes made in the game (Developers may not speak English native) but as'long as you don't have an o.c.d for spelling you will be fine.The ugly:MeRecommendation:  If the game is on sale go ahead it's very fun and ill be playing more 10 may be a bit for it but its still a good game worth the money.

								its still an alpha, so dont expect perfection  --  this game is far from perfection, but the concept is amazing.lot of things still to be fixed  - basic mechanics, crew and food management, fights and boarding - BUT there are a lot of good calls, and this game gets patched and improved once (or more) a week, this is really getting better everytime i play it.graphics, musics, pirates voices, items, parrots, ships - the core of Pixel Piracy is here and satisfying:quite difficult at start, it gets really nice after a while, since you have to look after your crew morale, supplies, items, weapons, and you'll probably permadie in the first times you play it, but hey! easy games are boring, right?

								Pixel Piracy is a pretty fun little game that is sure to entertain you for a few hours at least. While it could use some more polish and some of the interfacing could be a little better, it is not a complete game. You can build a pirate ship, starting from a few free blocks, and basically it's a pirate sim from there. Start from boarding other small crafts to shooting cannons from your gigantic ship. There is a few things to keep track of though and time management is also a factor. It's really a hard game and you will surely lose a lot when you first start but you learn what to do different every time. After it's updated, I'm sure I will be able to say that Pixel Piracy is one of my favorite indie games out there.			"

												The premise was promising: Terraria meets Sid Meier's Pirates, what could possibly go wrong?Well, a lot apparently.Right off the bat, the first problem I have is that I have no flipping clue what I'm doing. Nevermind all the arrs, the ""tutorial"" is hardly useful besides keeping you from dying before you even set sail. The interface is never explained in any notable detail, and the interface itself is unintuitive and badly designed. I still don't know how I'm supposed to save the game, even though the Exit Game button reminds me to, besides clicking that Exit Game button to force an autosave.The gameplay is also really really lacking. The premise of Terraria? No, not really. It's far better to capture better ships than to build your own, and unlike Terraria the interface just doesn't stimulate creativity. But what about the pirating, you ask? Nah, it's basically get some levels in the earlygame and then you're set; just tank the enemy ship if cannons are present and then just board with everyone and just win with sheer numbers. Same for islands, just with no cannons.Overall very disappointed. Was it worth the $1.49 I paid for because this was on sale? Maybe, I did spend a little under 5 hours on it. 32 cents per hour of entertainment? Meh, at least I didn't lose much.TL;DR: Boring, bad interface, only go for it if it's on sale and you are really interested.			"

												As soon as I saw the developer's name, I SHOULD have thought twice about buying this game but I loved the idea so much I bought it anyway when it first came out.Basically, the game has not changed since launch and by change I mean ""it hasn't been completed."" ... Just like all his other games. It's a great tech demo in a long line of tech demos that never get finished. There's plenty of balance issues, the UI breaks down as you try and keep up with the non-stop micromanagement. You can die for completely B.S. reasons (bugs) and lose everything. Worst of all, the game just stops being fun after the novelty wears off. He never added anything more to do. Your experience never grows. The first 30 minutes of gameplay is the same as the last 30 minutes of gameplay as you become so bored and frustated you just stop playing.This is the last time I give this guy money. I've learned my lesson.			"

								So far it's a cute, tough as nails rogue-lite pirate simulator with minecraft-esque ship building. The pirate combat can be a bit clunky for advanced tactices like focusing down targets but encounters are a lot of fun and learning when to back off can be a hillarious lesson in humility. Not everything is well explained in the tutorial, so make sure to experiment, such as sailing further than adjacent blocks. I have had fun with my time playing.			"

								Okay I dont usually write reviews for games... Okay I never do. But for this game it brought a different aspect in gaming that I never seen before, or i dont think... I love the type of gameplay that this has. It brings a level of certain strategy cause you have to wonder ""Can this island/ship be raidable?"" ""Will any of my crew die in this attack?"" The type of gameplay is like my favorite game on the DS ""Fire Emblem"" but for this game it isnt turn based. Its all out sending in your troops. I also like how you can save your game at the end of each map so that if your crew does end up dieng in the next round by hunger, drowning, or pirates, you can go back to ur last save and start it over or choose a different path.Overall I rate this game about 8/10 This game really passes time (even though i only played a little bit) and i really feel like it was worth the money. :)			"

								I first dismissed Pixel Piracy because I am not fond of 2d side-scrolling games and even though I put in plenty of effort I failed to enjoy Terraria which was advertised as similar in form and function.  Despite those discouragements I purchased Pixel Piracy  because I had a coupon that reduced the price a bit and had finally become bored with Rogue Legacy (awesome game).  Pixel Piracy has exceeded my expectations, its graphics and animations are charming in a minimalistic way and its sand-box rogue-like world creation increases its replay abilty.  There are still some bugs to work out, but the gameplay is easy to understand and I promise that if you give this game a half a chance it should at least be 20 hours of fun for you... also its resource requirements are minimal so you can play it on your back-up laptop :)			"

												I got this game through a CD Key from a website.I saw it was made from the same people who made Terraria so I got all excited, but it really was a disappointment for me.The tutorial truely confused me and left me scratching my head for 20 minutes.Then I skipped the tutorial and tried to play, but.. it just is overcomplicated.They could have made it so that instead of clicking where to go you can move the captain yourself using wasd and space bar. And groups or teams could be selected to go or just all go in one click. There really is no need for a tutorial if they just cleared up what to do and what things do rather than explaining or saying you have to buy.I thought this would be a pirate game somewhat like terraria, but I was wrong.Some people may disagree, but I rate this game 6/10.6/10 instead of anything lower because this game is fun to others, but its not as fun to me.In conclusion if you like RTS's, building, and 2d action, then you'll probably like this game, but since I only got about 27 mins into the game please read other reviews before concluding on this.

But....unfortunately this game was early access.  After raiding a ship, you destroy it up to get its contents. The dog Douglass was on the  enemy ship and for some reason the command to carry him to ours wasn't working. So with tears in my eyes  I blew up the enemy ship and watched Douglass perish too.

												UPDATE 08/17/2014:Repetetive, fun and flavorful. $15 feels a bit much, but this is worth a sale price.Crew and ship management aside, there are only 3 actions that make up the gameplay.Visit friendly town.Visit hostile island.Visit hostile ship.All hostile encounters are very brief, which is super smart. Otherwise the repetition would be tedious. Quick encounters with quick rewards and rapidly advancing crew capabilities do an admirable job of compensating for the lack of variety in actual gameplay. One hidden gem is the soundtrack. There are some quality songs in here. Highly recommended viewing:

								Other than when people graple onto my ship and fly into space, and everytime you kill a crate or animal you get a level up, this game is great. After a while if you have only been using one pirate, he can dodge every shot, insta-kill everything, and move extremely fast, so if you want to have a challenge in the game, make a larger crew. I myself have beaten all of the legendary enemies, but have not beaten all of the groups that appear after each legendary enemy is destroyed. In my opinion, the game can end too fast, but getting to the end is really fun :3			"

												First of all, Pixel Piracy is a really fun game that I feel like I've been waiting my entire life for. Ever since going on a one piece kick several years ago, I've wanted to sail the sees collecting crew and deal with the problems that pirates have to, and Pixel Piracy delivers on most accounts.Unfortunately, while the random events are exciting in the beginning, after a while they start to feel samey. Gathering a crew is fun and it hurts when they die as death is permanent, but once you get a large crew you start to realize that aside from whatever random thing the person says, everyone is basically the same.The pirate ship customization was a nice feature, but I found stealing and adding to other ships to be a much preferable alternative to making one from scratch.I got a good ten hours out of the game before I stopped playing, raising multiple pirate crews in the mean time. The last crew I played I decided that I would reset every time one of my crew members died so I'd finally get to challenge a legendary pirate. I got bored before then, and I doubt I'll ever get around to playing that far again.All in all, I had a lot of fun when I was playing it, and I was glad that I never had to look up a wiki thanks to an in game help section, which really wiled away the time spent sailing. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes pirates, just don't expect too much out of it.			"

								I came into this expecting very little actually and what I got was a whole lot more than that. I was practically blind going into this, I hadn't even seen gameplay footage, just a screenshot showing off a large, complex ship, fighting another large complex ship with a whole lot of bloom lighting effects.Turns out there's a lot more to this game than just the bloom graphics. The game is essentially an extremely accessible risk vs. reward strategy game, where progress is rewarded with more money to purchase shipbuilding materials, skills, hire more crewmembers, tools, weapons, etc. Because it's easy to get jump aboard and get right to playing and making progress, the game is extremely accessible to new players of the strategy genre.What hooked me is ship building. The game has this focus on gaining more and more material to build your ship with by destroying other ships to loot their materials, allowing you to add on to your own ship using them. Additionally, you can purchase new materials and decorations for your ship with gold you earn from taking on enemy ships and plundering their precious loot.While I got the game for free due (Thanks Gameiki.com and HERO) I would definitely say it’s worth the money they’re asking for, and since Relogic aquired publishing rights for the game, there is probably, like 1000s of steam coupons floating around for the game if you don’t have it and want a discount. (Provided it’s not already on sale, which at the time of this review, It is)			"

												Pixel Piracy is a great indie rpg with rougelike elements.  You create a captain and sail around your world fighting pirates, visiting islands, discovering treasure, and learning secrets. All while leveling up your captain and crew and building a bigger and better ship!  All this in pixelie 2D pirate action! I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of indie games, 2D RPG's or ""rougelike likes"".			"

Product received for free
												I got this game through a CD Key from a website.I saw it was made from the same people who made Terraria so I got all excited, but it really was a disappointment for me.The tutorial truely confused me and left me scratching my head for 20 minutes.Then I skipped the tutorial and tried to play, but.. it just is overcomplicated.They could have made it so that instead of clicking where to go you can move the captain yourself using wasd and space bar. And groups or teams could be selected to go or just all go in one click. There really is no need for a tutorial if they just cleared up what to do and what things do rather than explaining or saying you have to buy.I thought this would be a pirate game somewhat like terraria, but I was wrong.Some people may disagree, but I rate this game 6/10.6/10 instead of anything lower because this game is fun to others, but its not as fun to me.In conclusion if you like RTS's, building, and 2d action, then you'll probably like this game, but since I only got about 27 mins into the game please read other reviews before concluding on this.

Early Access Review
								I was expecting the same controls for Terraria/Arthur's Gold, but i was wrong.The controls are weird at first, Arrow keys/A D controls your camera, left click controls your captain, right click controls your crew; well you are not exactly controlling anything, it's sort of... a command where the AI tries to follow it.The start can be tough for some people, initial stats are random you can end up with ""useless"" stats and you early game can be even ""harder"".There is a Morale and Hunger bar, most of the people tries to fill morale by paying salaries but you can do it for free at the tavern only pay salaries when you are really far from any town with a tavern or you crew wont listen to you and eventually they will attack you; Hunger is not a problem at all, your ship starts with 2 watermelons (2 servings each), once you learn cooking and fishing (and get a fishing rod) you will be fine, you can even sell extra fish to get more gold.It is a good game lots of fun so far, and i definitely recommend it, expect bugs/balance issues, but as a beta game that's to be expected, looking forward to 1.0 :)			"

Early Access Review
								 I began by naming  myself Euguene Krabs, captured a crew of animals, a dog , a turtle and a crab. I forgot to buy food and almost starved.  A little later my crab died during a raid. I was demoralized. Then the turtle shortly after drowned after being knocked off the ship. I promised myself the same wouldn't happen with the dog. So I hired a REAL crew, the Krusty Krew. I had a cook , a poo cleaner a cannonneer , and 2 fighter specialists. Oh! Did we raid, we sunk many ships, killed dozens of natives, pooped everywhere, and drank rum all the time. But....unfortunately this game was early access.  After raiding a ship, you destroy it up to get its contents. The dog Douglass was on the  enemy ship and for some reason the command to carry him to ours wasn't working. So with tears in my eyes  I blew up the enemy ship and watched Douglass perish too. To this day me and my 8 man crew still pillag, still drink , and still laugh but we don't forget the original crew who set sail with me long before.....8/10 very fun, but will remind you occasionally that its early access.

												UPDATE 08/17/2014:Repetetive, fun and flavorful. $15 feels a bit much, but this is worth a sale price.Crew and ship management aside, there are only 3 actions that make up the gameplay.Visit friendly town.Visit hostile island.Visit hostile ship.All hostile encounters are very brief, which is super smart. Otherwise the repetition would be tedious. Quick encounters with quick rewards and rapidly advancing crew capabilities do an admirable job of compensating for the lack of variety in actual gameplay. One hidden gem is the soundtrack. There are some quality songs in here. Highly recommended viewing:

								Other than when people graple onto my ship and fly into space, and everytime you kill a crate or animal you get a level up, this game is great. After a while if you have only been using one pirate, he can dodge every shot, insta-kill everything, and move extremely fast, so if you want to have a challenge in the game, make a larger crew. I myself have beaten all of the legendary enemies, but have not beaten all of the groups that appear after each legendary enemy is destroyed. In my opinion, the game can end too fast, but getting to the end is really fun :3			"

												Pirates? - check.Adventures? - check.Fancy graphics? - check.Strange noices? - check.Multiplayer? - hmm... sorry, not yet won't even have, most likely.Pixel Piracy is entertaining pixel styled game about pirates! You start with 2 men crew (including yourself), raid and pillage enemy ships, get money, buy weapons, new ships and new crew members! Then you raid and pillage more enemy ships, get more money, buy more weapons, better ships, recruit more crew members and so on! Hmm... I made it sound very boring, did not I I?... But there's not much to it, to be honest. It's not a good game for endless gameplay. It's great for people who want to play game for few minutes on free times. ""there are better games if I want to spend my time if I have small free time. And they are more cheap."" - you will say. You are wrong. What's better than raiding and burning enemy ships, getting money to recruit crew members, buying them cool weapons and getting them big ship?! There's nothing more interesting, of course! Plus, every pirate has different sound effect! erm... what?! They make different fancy sounds, I mean... saying some strange things which I can't remember... So, um... It's cool game, I want to say!If you ask if this game's worth buying or not, I'll tell you this: Get this game on sale. I personally got it from bundle some time ago, so I'm satisfied with it. To be honest, I don't think devs are going to make more developments to this game, so don't expect lot from it. Game's not too big, so it will get boring after a while - that's why I said it's for people who want to play a game when they have small free time on their hands. I personally have not played a lot yet, but I can say one thing for sure - I like it very much!Edit: Forgot to say, there's actually more to this game! There are poops! what?! Yes, you heard it correctly! Birds poop on your ship, so one of the crew members go and drop it into the water! Interesting, isn't it?! or I'm just strange to be interested in throwing poops into the water Only people similar to me can understand! There's also an achievement to have 5 poops on your ship at once! "

												I would recommend the game if a majority of the supposed things listed in game worked as listed.Example. I find a chicken. Those things lay eggs right? NOT HERE!!! IT JUST ♥♥♥♥♥ 24\7  such an odd example listed above, but a core part of the gameplay is what throws off the game.Another lovely example! At the beginning you are given several choices that supposedly affect your gameplay, from 'odd happenings during the night time'  to 'more pirate encounters'  and a third option that i've forgotten.  I chose the 'more night time activities' one.  Nothing has ever happened.It's a nice fun grind at first.  Then it becomes an annoying grind to the finish.Sheet. I haven't even beaten any of the bosses yet despite the time put in the game, it just became a dull grind as I slowly made my way towards the end.  An end with innummerable islands, pirate encounters that all become the same thing after the first several exciting times.Such a bummer that a lovely promising game gets abandoned with one guy and he may sometimes see this kinda critcism.

												I purchased this with a coupon from badges, and I'm glad I was able to get it for so cheap. It has a lot of potential, but as is it's just not worth it. The tutorial isn't very helpful beyond the very basics, and the UI/controls are clunky and difficult to figure out. This could be annoying, but combined with the fact that after a while, the game either slows down to unplayable speeds or your crew inexplicably stops responding to commands no matter what yo try, make this not worthwhile. I like the graphics, and I liked the concept, but the execution is pretty bad.			"

Keyboard is ok I guess.Audio: 92/100The music And Sound is Perfect for the game But when it comes to commanding a lot the sounds get a bit annoying but I can't complain to much about it I'll just say its well themed for the game. I would say it needs more sound affects to weapons like small beat music to them when you attack the enemies.Graphics: 64/100The Graphics are ok but when it comes to computers it will lag for some reason it needs more improvements on it so it won't lag or something. But again I love the graphics its perfect. Your doing a great job lazy developer.Balance Between Challenging and Impossible: 75/100 (Don't count as points)Its Easy to get going in the game but a bit hard to keep up with your crew and payment which increase like crazy over a damn minute of playing the game it needs to be a bit slow like real life job pay off so it won't be such a problem I mean it depends on the Difficulty you picked. The enemies are a easy kill so  I want more Random Events like being Attacked by Sea Creatures something well related to Jack Sparrow, Monster attacking towns. Fighting angels and devil. Mountains that you enter to go into caves or underground hunting for certain items.. Thousands of quest to do. Shark attacks, Snowy islands , Lava. Everything you can put into this game. Its Easy to play so make it more interesting and challenging..Other: 40/100I would like to see a calender, a better night/Day time System when time changes the whole island changes to spring, summer, winter etc Main Stories and a bunch sub side stories that would interest the gamer to be stuck into the game. I recommend this game to those who love adventure.Rated 264/400 "

												Pixel PiracyControls: 68/100 Mouse+KeyboardScreen Movement: A  or ←  D or → Right click: Control your crew to move or attackafter selecting group 1-6Left click: Control your captain to moveor attack and to select options.Spacebar: Interacts with objects like Totems,Stores, as well as Treasure ChestsESC: Pauses game and activates the menu screenIt is also used when your captain dies.Keys 1-6: Groups you can assign crew-mates toSelect a group to use right click.Icon Interaction left click and drag: Drag commands from the bottom icons to move your units/crew.Interact: Icon (F)  Move your captain to the object, then click theinteract icon, or F key, to interact withPlunder Icon: Begin a plunder of the enemy ship which gives.Capture Icon: Take control and capture enemy ship (Losing your actual one)The controls Are is a bit to much for beginners plus the game has no Controller support sadly I was hoping for but its fine.. Keyboard is ok I guess.Audio: 92/100The music And Sound is Perfect for the game But when it comes to commanding a lot the sounds get a bit annoying but I can't complain to much about it I'll just say its well themed for the game. I would say it needs more sound affects to weapons like small beat music to them when you attack the enemies.Graphics: 64/100The Graphics are ok but when it comes to computers it will lag for some reason it needs more improvements on it so it won't lag or something. But again I love the graphics its perfect. Your doing a great job lazy developer.Balance Between Challenging and Impossible: 75/100 (Don't count as points)Its Easy to get going in the game but a bit hard to keep up with your crew and payment which increase like crazy over a damn minute of playing the game it needs to be a bit slow like real life job pay off so it won't be such a problem I mean it depends on the Difficulty you picked. The enemies are a easy kill so  I want more Random Events like being Attacked by Sea Creatures something well related to Jack Sparrow, Monster attacking towns. Fighting angels and devil. Mountains that you enter to go into caves or underground hunting for certain items.. Thousands of quest to do. Shark attacks, Snowy islands , Lava. Everything you can put into this game. Its Easy to play so make it more interesting and challenging..Other: 40/100I would like to see a calender, a better night/Day time System when time changes the whole island changes to spring, summer, winter etc Main Stories and a bunch sub side stories that would interest the gamer to be stuck into the game. I recommend this game to those who love adventure.Rated 264/400 "

												I would recommend the game if a majority of the supposed things listed in game worked as listed.Example. I find a chicken. Those things lay eggs right? NOT HERE!!! IT JUST ♥♥♥♥♥ 24\7  such an odd example listed above, but a core part of the gameplay is what throws off the game.Another lovely example! At the beginning you are given several choices that supposedly affect your gameplay, from 'odd happenings during the night time'  to 'more pirate encounters'  and a third option that i've forgotten.  I chose the 'more night time activities' one.  Nothing has ever happened.It's a nice fun grind at first.  Then it becomes an annoying grind to the finish.Sheet. I haven't even beaten any of the bosses yet despite the time put in the game, it just became a dull grind as I slowly made my way towards the end.  An end with innummerable islands, pirate encounters that all become the same thing after the first several exciting times.Such a bummer that a lovely promising game gets abandoned with one guy and he may sometimes see this kinda critcism.

This review takes an in-depth look at all of the ways that Quadro Delta's Pixel Piracy fails in design and execution (even after its updates).[. . .] Pixel Piracy tries to be a lot of things: an RTS game, a ship-building exploration game, a party-based RPG, and a roguelike. The result is a very weak example of each and every one of those genres—if I didn’t consider it overly charitable to call it a ‘jack’ of anything, the saying ‘jack of all trades, master of none’ would apply.

												I purchased this with a coupon from badges, and I'm glad I was able to get it for so cheap. It has a lot of potential, but as is it's just not worth it. The tutorial isn't very helpful beyond the very basics, and the UI/controls are clunky and difficult to figure out. This could be annoying, but combined with the fact that after a while, the game either slows down to unplayable speeds or your crew inexplicably stops responding to commands no matter what yo try, make this not worthwhile. I like the graphics, and I liked the concept, but the execution is pretty bad.			"

												the game would be cool i like the idea of messing around with pirates and making your own shipexept the pirate (and crew) ai sucks it is the worst out of every game i have ever played you often have to give orders several times before they will listen and when in combat you lose all control which doesnt sound too bad but its pretty much luck most of the time the entire enemy team will just swarm one person on your team gets very annoying. the ship building is terrible as well a huge letdown there is very little depth to it its littlerally click here and a melon falls out of the sky right in the middle of your deck, lots of fun. i expected better from the makers of terraria			"

												Being a pirate, sailing the seas, conquering new lands, and giving skills to your crew members. These skills can be useful, like increasing damage, or cooking, or even fishing. What's the most important is cleaning. BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE PERSON YOU HIRE JUST S**TS ALL OVER THE BOAT BECAUSE WHY NOT.			"

												Very fun, creative pirate simulator. You can make your own ship and can loot other ships and islands. But after a while bugs and gameplay stars to boring. Your crew drop down to edge of island for nothing, so much overpowered enemys appears. Good in the idea but not a long-lived game because of there is no backup.			"

You have to keep your pirates' mood up all the time by visiting taverns so they can have a good time 'n' drink. You can also customise your pirate ship to look exactly how you want it.

												Pixel piracy!With drunken sailors and bearded women you set sail to be the best and possible the worst pirate ever made! by a few choices your have made ur uggly fearless pirate and embark on your quest,First things first read the handbok:1. dont attack a pirate larger then level 1 or it will ear you alive and drink rum from ur skull.2. dont sail to an island as level 1 or this will also kill you.3. dont forget to pay the scum you have aboard yea thats right unless you want to end up in the water..4. Learn the crew how to poo,Eat,Clean and yea maybe kill something if ur lucky.5. Build a floating bucket, must look like a barrel extra points if its a flying ship.6. Stay alive and remember that crew eat, well.... depends sometimes they dont cause they whanna die of hunger dont worry this is totally normal since you dont eat... much7. Tame animals and die trying, laugh repeat and then die some more.8. Dig everywhere, you never know...9. Rum boost morale and makes you drunken master in fighting ""yeaaap""10. Never bring a chicken to a rum fight.All in all a must have and i really hope they continue with this game idea its great and when they finish this one the should make another or juts improve this one!! yea thats right make it more epic then epic.. yea polish a gem to be a bigger one! erm.. YEA! 10/10 (the game has taken ages to be this good and if you deside to make a sequel they better not in the seven hells release to soon, but honestly make this game better and better and who knows u might be able to even start with dlc's)Go for it.

Early Access Review
								After spending a few hours with this game, I would like to pen my fustration and annoyance, as the autosave feature doesnt actually create a save file.It's a pretty solid base for a game, make a ship, collect gold, level up skills, earn a crew, fight bigger enemies. I enjoyed playing it after the initial 20minutes it took me to realise WTF I was doing, and learnt which fights to avoid (hover over enemies to check their health).A tutorial would be fantastic, as it's a little bit tough to get your head around what is going on. I still dont know how to catch animals, but theres a whole menu for it when you press esc. Speaking of, the escape menu is terrible. You cant check your inventory without going to the individual pirates page and equiping them, you need to press a little hidden button in the top left to set sail when you've navigated to an area and there's not really any indication of what you can do/when. The AI for crew and captain is terrible, you have to click like a madman to get out of a fight you are losing. There's minimal ways to heal an injured teammate. There's no direction to the game either, no overarching story line that'd ""hook"" me to play again.Saying that, when I was playing I was having fun blowing up ships and trying to cheat the RNG encounters at sea. It's cute seeing captain feathersword get his♥♥♥♥♥handed to him time and time again.All in all, needs more work done to it to turn this concept game into a functioning, polished, user-friendly state.4/10.TL;DR - Pirates! The difficulty curve is too high for too little reward. Pick this game up in a few years.			"

												Although many enjoy this game, I did not. I've only played 20 minutes of it and I'm completly confused and lost. The game did a terrible job of describing what I should do. Although I do wish for a lot of freedom in games, after the tutorial of this game I found myself not knowning what I was doing, what I was going to do, and how I would even do it. I walked blindly through the game trying to work out mechanics as I went but it was very difficult to do so. I wish for the best for this game and the creators but I wish that some more explantion can be thrown into the tutorial. I should not have to watch a video on the internet to figure out how to play. I will give this game another try once I watch some videos made by experts, but until then I will question if my 10$ spent on this game was really worth it. I'm not able to put much money into video games, so I hope that some discovery can turn my current opinion around. Thank you,  ---Boomer			"

												Nope.Saw some popular youtubers playing this a while back. I bought it, because it seemed like a great game, and the fact that it was early access just meant that it would be added to above this to me, so I downloaded it.Upon launch, crash. Well, okay then, I suppose it's early access.Launch again, play for a bit. To be honest I would have prefered it crash again. You don't have any freedom to create a ship, it's like being told to build big ben and being given half a bucket of lego bricks.As far as actually playing goes, it was about as balanced as the ocean we were sailing on. I would either painfully slowly watch as I got a tiny bit of income after paying my crew and buying essential supplies, because the gameplay just does not pay up. The fighting is pretty much just throw all your crew at the other ship, if you have more crew, you might well win. If not, then you're going to come out of that fight dead or with less crew, and at that point, it's going to take a while to get another crew member.And that's just the ship fights, you so much as set foot on an island and the locals will maul you to death. And then I see that there are 'epics' floating around in the open waters. Packed full of crew. And cannons. Yeah! there are cannons. Good luck ever finding out how the hell you can get them on your ship, never played long enough.Oh and then it crashed. I said I might come back and have a look later when it's further through development.What's that? The developers abandoned it and left a single man on the case?......This game put me off early access. Don't buy it.			"

												Forget pixel piracy. Garbage like this is why real piracy exists. Charging even 1 cent for this game is where the real piracy is. This game is so awful that the original devs abandoned it and some other guy bought it out. It is really awful even if I keep playing and try to figure out what to do. No wonder at one point this game had mostly negative reviews. I guess it has been worked on over the year it has been out and improved. It still sucks so badly that I would hate to see what it was like when it first came out. It does not deserve the mostly positive reviews that it has now because it just sucks. A prime example of how not to make a indie game. Lack of direction, non-intuitive controls, and stupid logic. The interface is mainly what is so unintuitive about the game. It is riddled with glitches, bugs, and technical problems out the wazzu according to other users. The game has a complete lack of technical polish. One of the most technically unsound games I have ever played. A very messy game all around. It just never felt tight and smooth for me like any other good game would, just felt like a rough garbled mess of a pre-alpha because it basically is. You and your crew are mentally incapable (much like this games creators) of taking a dump over the side of the ship so your ship just fills up with feces. The first island I ""sailed"" to had a few little creatures on it. I got off with my captain and tried going to them to use the ""move animal"" command. They started attacking me which is fine they are wild animals, but I couldn't kill them even though they are what looks to be chickens and ferrets. They chase me back to the ship. I command my crew of two to go and kill them, they immediately knockback my crew off the island into the water where not only can they not swim, they sink to the bottom of the ocean, game over.They also treat the gamer like an idiot as well and make fun of you just to be smart a--es on purpose. The first time a pirate killed me I got a achievement called ""Noob"". Purposely called a noob by the developers because I died because of their total lack of direction lol. They celebrate the fact that the game has knockback by asking you what percentage of knockback you want when you start a new game, like they are saying ""ha ha, our game has knock back like it or not"". The game should not have knockback. Why should it? Do I fly 5ft backwards irl when a ferret touches me? Why does this game need to have knockback? Why does any game for that matter? Do I jump in water and immediately sink and drown irl? Does anybody? No, but they don't care what you as a gamer think and that is strikingly apparant in every area of this game's horrible, flawed, outdated and broken design.I have never seen a game this badly void of any basic logic and with such a heavy lack of direction and unintuitive controls. There was no music and the only sound effects are a ten year old kid saying ""son of a biscuit!"" over and over and over and over nonstop and some other pirate phrases being said in either high pitch voices to sound like chipmonks or low pitched which still sounds like a ten year old kids voice being pitch shifted low.I got this in a bundle I bought for Unepic, which is a good game. They might as well have bundled a bloody vag rag with aids on it with Unepic instead of this game. This game is going into the trash bin. You want a real sailing game where you get to be a pirate? Play Assassin's Creed 4. Out of the 570+ games I own on steam, this is in the top ten for worst.If you were allowed to trade your games and I could trade this for a punch in the nose I would consider that totally fair because that is about what this dog♥♥♥♥♥♥suck garbage is worth. -100/10. Go f--k yourselves.			"

												This game game is a ton of fun. It takes lots of strategy to be good at the game. Even on normal difficulty, you need to be witty about what you decide to attack and what level ups to choose etc etc. If you make the mistake of not spending the money on the right things, you may end up starving your crew to death, which I almost did. For a $10 game I usually only expect 4-5 hours of content; but with the constant updates, I haven't played for 3 months and came back and it felt like playing it all over again. Def pick this game up.			"

								Don't buy this game.  As of now, there is not enough balance to keep it fun.  There is more frustration and reloading, than anything.  You might argue that it's an Early Access Game and is subject to get better.  I would retort back at that the developer is a tad condescending to the users and doesn't seem to agree with customer suggestions.  The imbalance is intentional.  Be warned, ye pirates.			"

As I write this review it is on sale so for a little over 2 bucks that is not bad otherwise the game is ten bucks and that is still not a bad price. The devs have not moved on from this game either despite what others are saying. I find this is a good casual game to leave and come back to when ever you are looking for a game to play. I will admit there are bugs but I hardly notice them. any way give this game a try its allot of fun.			"

												The game is only worth it's current sale price which is 85% off 9.99 aka $1.49 USD.They released the game unfinished, and continued to fix their mistakes (yay) for several months maybe even a year.Sadly, they never finished fixing all the bugs, or adding all the content, and now the devs as far as I know have abandoned the game.Q.) Is it playable?A.) It has a few hours worth of gameplay, before encouting bugs and late game balance issues. Actually, everything is unbalanced.You know, save yourself some money and only get the game on sale.I personally wouldn't recommend anything from these devs, unfortunately. This game was decent, then broken, then in development, then released, then in more development... Sadly the end result isn't much better than where it was. And a sloppy developer isn't going to get better the more money you throw at them.And the OST? Lol, not worth $3.99. Should be part of buying the game.Sorry, I just lost faith after all the tweaking and supposed fixes that eventually changed really nothing. it was fun while it lasted in development, because there were excuses for it all. But it hasn't been in early access for... Idk, over a year, maybe 2 years? I lost track of time. I'm only here to not recommend the game.It's your money, spend it how you want.R.I.P. Pixel Piracy.

												Pixel Piracy can be resumed as a concept game with unhealthy obsessions for poop deck jokes and pixelated bleeding. The concept works simply and well enough to be fun for about 20 hours of game play, then it gets quite repetitive. You side scroll pirate ship battles, build a ship and a crew from your plunders and find booty yarr! That's about it.For it's peculiar game play and to encourage Indie game developers I have no problem recommending it, but don't expect to find much more than what's on the cover.			"

												Normally I do not write reviews, but after reading all of the over the top negative reviews I figured I would write one to more accurately depict the game.Are there a few bugs?  Sure there are, but the Devs update the game weekly to fix any known issues.The biggest complaint I can find is that there is a bit of a steep learning curve.  However, once the mechanics and controls of the game are understood the game is very enjoyable.  You get to custom build a ship; you can choose to either take over or plunder an enemy ship; you can even engage in ship vs ship events and island invasions.  The music is catchy and after hours of playing this game you'll find yourself talking like a pirate!  Ultimately, Pixel PIracy is game that will provide hours of entertainment and while at times the game feels a bit stale due to the repetiveness of gameplay who doesn't enjoy roaming the seas with a crew of pirates?!

												Now that the 1.0 is officially released, the game is significantly more playable and provides fun with a sense of purpose. I hope to see continuing updates as there are some things that I dislike (mayhaps it is intentional?)   --Hunger is difficult to suppress and most foods only provide HP, not hunger (it should help at least a tiny bit?)    --Numerous times I had just fed my poor pirates as I scoured town to town to buy food to stock on the ship which they then had to be on the boat to eat.    --These pirates are savages! They don't share the food and only think about themselves. I wish there was someway to ration or manually make one eat.   --Hunger goes down way too fast, I finally got to a shop and spent all the money I had only to run back to the ship to eat it and be basically slightly better off than I was before, but now poor.   --Food doesn't cost a lot, but I often never have money to buy enough. Most games conclude in starvation.    --All the previous notes are about hunger; but there are times the screen gets really convoluted. Why can't I zoom in/out anymore? It was a decent function.   --ALSO, a huge thing that really bothers me is that when you stock food in a barrel and the barrel is removed (e.g., if you capture a different ship) the food disappears! I mean, you stock up all your money and go on a long trip and find a sick pirate ship that you can steal (cuz thats what pirates do) and you have no food in the middle of nowhere. And why are there seagulls pooping on my ship in the middle of the ocean!?   --So ya think that fishing would solve the hunger issue... ""Oh just get yourself the fishing rod and fish/cook skill!"" Well not so fast my scurvied friend, the pirates have such bad ADHD that they can't do just ONE task. Fishing is never effective because he would rather clean up poop or glutton over the ramen in the 5th barrel i had to buy or practice with the sword rack when he really doesn't need to. It is a great game. I just have a headache from the little pirates not doing what I want them to.			"

												The controls can be a bit confusing at first, and sometimes it feels like my crew does whatever they want anyways, but this game is quite charming and very enjoyable.Definitely worth checking out.			"

												This game is not too complex, but it is enjoyable. I recommend any game that gets me for 8+ hours (I don't have much time to play).It has something magic on doing 4 things for hours. You go to shop, you modify your ship, you go to islands and you fight other ships. That's it, but you can't quit. Maybe it is because you need to know if you are going to have money for your sailor's salaries. Maybe it is because you want to take out all other pirates and be the king of pirates. Maybe you just want to trap chickens and train them to be a killing machine. Or maybe you just want to have your ship as a Royal Caribbean cruise with all the ammenities and plenty of food.I would recommend if pixel graphics don't bother you, and you enjoy non-intensive action games.Graphics: 7 if you like pixel graphics. Colorful, nice, few images (repeated)Gameplay: 8: simple click and wasd, grinding, waiting times where you just check your crew to avoid a mutiny. But it has something that prevents you from quitting the game (maybe it's because it has an autosave feature and I don't have an idea how to manually save)Story: 9: well, not a really rich story (no story at all), but who the heck wouldn't like to be a pirate.Fun: 9. This game is very enjoyable.Note: I've read some comments where they complaint about bugs. I haven't got any bugs so far. My pirates won't suicide or drown into the water (maybe they have to change their ship layout). No crashes so far.			"

												I Lov this game I bought it when it first came out due to my love for teraria. and I will say I  was a little dissapoiunted in the amount of bugs and glitches. first off I set out to beat this game but the first file i did this on all of my pirates drowned themselves because the game bugged out and wouldnt let them walk back on the ship. Honestly if the bugs were gone I would not only recoment this game but pay a little extra for it. I have more than enjoied my time with it and the developers are trying to fix all of the issues including the lack of vertical camera. 8.7/10.0			"

												One of the most engaging 2D games I have played in a long time. Very intense control of upgrading and customizing yourself and crew. The combat gets a little repetative after a couple of hours, but still enjoyable. Very fun trying to gain wealth in order to expand your crew and ship. Takes times and patience, but well worth the effort when you have an awesome ship and crew that kicks butt.			"

												I have about 20 hours logged into this game so far and I've really enjoyed what I've seen.  It does have a few things outstanding that could use some polish,  but there is so much potential here that I am excited to keep playing and watch what the developers turn out each patch, who are still very much hard at work.When you start the game there will be a slight learning curve as you figure out how to manage your crew's morale (hint: restore it for free by sending them to taverns) and your ship's food supply (hint: train a fisherman with high luck) then you can really start exploring and having fun with the game.If you run into a bug, just search the community forums for a workaround; so far I haven't encountered any that were game breaking.

												Overall Score: 9/10Pros:  I have been playing this game since early access. This game has gone through many development stages. Based upon player feedback they fixed many bugs and made many enhancements to the game. I can honestly say that I am proud to have been part of the experience. With that said if you ever wanted to be a captain of a ship and enjoy awesome pixel retro graphics then this is the game for you. This is a strategy game where you must keep your crew, fed, happy and try not to get them killed. Your crew will level up and you must decide to boost their stats or have them learn new skills. The game is very balanced, changing while still maintaining the fun factor. The game is out of early access but the developers are continuing to give the game free updates.Did I forget to mention that you can build and fully customize your pirate ship? The game delivers as not just a pirate sim but as an overall game. The offer tons of replay value and you can’t beat it for the price.Cons:  Being that I have to pick something it’s that there aren’t any type of multiplayer modes. However, the game doesn’t need it as the game is really designed be a single player game. However, if they were to add a PVP mode in the future where you could have ship battles that would add an entirely new game its self.			"

												So I have to admit, I had been kicking around the idea of buying this game for quite some time.  I finally pulled the trigger during the Steam Holiday Sale.  I honestly can't remember how much I spent.  After a few hours of gameplay, seeing how passionate the Developer is about not only the product itself, but how much it means for he or she to get the title out there to people who are less fortunate, I cannot but help give a positive recommendation for this title. The recent surge in the 8/16 -bit graphics looking games has really given me the nostalgia of from when I was kid growing up in the 80's and early 90's.  Whats not to love?  Pirates, pillaging, and poop.  Sure, it feels a little repetative after a bit, but I have yet to encounter a game over the years that is not repetetive in some form or fashion.  Easy read tutorials make it easy to learn.   Building your crew may take a little time. I was up to a crew of five within a couple hours.  Let there be no mistake training your crew is core to your success as captain.  All in all, its tongue in cheek humor, cheeky sea shanties, and the ability to build and sail your vessel as you see fit makes me wish I had purchased it sooner.   I would have gladly paid full price knowing what I know now about the game and developer.  I on a scale of ten, I give it a solid 8+.The only real critique/suggestion I would make:  keep speacialty skills as purchasable items, but turn them into professions(boarding party, gunners, shipwrights , etc.).  Things like swimming, cleaning, and other basic seamanship skills should be default progression when your sailors level up.			"

Pirates, pillaging, and poop.  Sure, it feels a little repetative after a bit, but I have yet to encounter a game over the years that is not repetetive in some form or fashion.  Easy read tutorials make it easy to learn.   Building your crew may take a little time. I was up to a crew of five within a couple hours.  Let there be no mistake training your crew is core to your success as captain.  All in all, its tongue in cheek humor, cheeky sea shanties, and the ability to build and sail your vessel as you see fit makes me wish I had purchased it sooner.   I would have gladly paid full price knowing what I know now about the game and developer.  I on a scale of ten, I give it a solid 8+.The only real critique/suggestion I would make:  keep speacialty skills as purchasable items, but turn them into professions(boarding party, gunners, shipwrights , etc.).  Things like swimming, cleaning, and other basic seamanship skills should be default progression when your sailors level up.			"

												The game's complete trash. If George Bush's presidency was forged into pixels, this is it. Don't listen to the top positive review's ""negitive reviews are from months ago"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game is horrible in GUI, gameplay, soundtrack, voice acting, plot, character creation, things to do, making sense, inventory, and just about every other thing in the English dictionary.I'd rather have a slinky.

'Do you recommend this game'? yes.Let me tell you the tale of the SS-SWAGAROONY. There once was a brave pirate called 'Austin Tkushaka', Austin Tkushaka was the son of some pirate idk lets get to the point. So Austin Tkushaka had one dream and one dream only, to have a decently looking ship and more than 2 crew members. Austin Tkushaka went to a nearby tavern to get together a crew, and by a crew of course I mean just one person. After about 10 seconds of searching Austin found the perfect person. Austin had the power to somehow name all of his crew members so he called it '*****', I have to bleep the name for security reasons but lets just call him Chang. So Austin and Chang set off like 14 metres and fought off an island, they then decided to up their game and start taking on level one boats.buuuuuuutt they wanted another crew member before they started getting extreme, and so Austin and Chang went back to the tavern and got this hippy-looking guy who used to make hats. Because of his hat making, we gave him the very formal nickname 'Fashion ♥♥♥'. So with this new kid on da block, they decided to start taking shipsbuuuuuuutt they wanted to do one more island first. They went to an island right next to the one they just conquered, and on it was a single dark skinned man. Austin, Chang and Fashion ♥♥♥ went off the boat and started beating him up, when he begged for his life and asked if he could join us, Austin said yes. Like I mentioned earlier, Austin had the power to change people’s names, so he called him 'Abbo man'. (By abbo of course Austin means A.B.B.A but it was like a spelling error I swear to god plz no hate).So Abbo man joined Austin, Chang and Fashion ♥♥♥ in their quest for decent ship. They then started their boat-taking quest.They were successful with their boat-taking, they captured like 2 boats and were successful in their endeavours, UNTILLL they decided to capture a very particular boat. Wait no the boat was normal and boring but it was really particular and special because this is the boat that killed Austin Tkushaka. Sorry give me a moment I’m getting emotional. So back to the story, Austin Tkushaka had just died and the crew took over the ship and killed everyone inside. Chang, being the first person Austin had hired, because the new leader of the SS-SWAGAROONY. Now Chang leading the SS-SWAGAROONY was the biggest change the group had experienced ever in the history of life. Chang decided that they wanted to ride in style instead of some scrubby boat, so they tried to take over a level 2 ship and succeeded. Another thing Chang did was add the 3 greatest, well some of the greatest, fighters in SS-SWAGAROONY history. These were 'party man', 'ahghghgggh', and 'rave man'. All of them had equal stats throughout the time they were aboard the SS-SWAGAROONY. So now the ship had 6 people on it and was being lead by Chang. With Chang’s help the group was just about ready to get a level 3 ship, when suddenly, Chang died. To be completely honest I forgot how Chang died, but I THINK that it was in a battle on a ship, lets just say that for story purposes. So the next person in line for the SS-SWAGAROONY was Fashion ♥♥♥. The first thing Fashion ♥♥♥ did when he got power was get a level 3 ship. Then he decided to fix the fact that there was poop all over the boat. They travelled and they travelled, looking for gold to buy for the 'cleaning' book. After some time, they got the book and Fashion ♥♥♥ learn how to throw poop off the side of the ship, proving his worth as a leader. Fashion ♥♥♥ then continued to change the SS-SWAGAROONY. He added 3 or 4 more people (who turned out to be so useless I don’t remember their names) to the ship and he trained everybody. Another thing he did was stock up on food. And by stock up i mean 90% of the ship floors would be some type of food. He also got this really cool level 4 ship.But Fashion ♥♥♥ had one flaw which would make him the worst leader in SS-SWAGAROONY history, he was like two times slower than everyone else in the game. So like when we went to take over a ship, when they were done he would finally get onto the ship. Now this was the biggest issue on the SS-SWAGAROONY at the moment, so Fashion ♥♥♥ decided to fix it before it was too late. Fashion ♥♥♥ looked far and wide for a solution too his slowness, and in a level 3 town he found it, a book which change his walking speed by 10%. Buuuut he had already spent all his money on food so Fashion ♥♥♥ needed a solutionTL;DR: he started destroying boats and then sold all his weapons and had around 5 thousand dollars. he then got the book but it make like no differenceThis is where things started going bad, right at this moment. See Fashion ♥♥♥ needed to spend all this money somehow, so he looked for a level 4 towns and never found one, but instead started seeing vikings and level 5 ships. He did not encounter many, and so far Fashion ♥♥♥ had only had to see the other 2 leaders die, he wasn’t going to let anybody die on the SS-SWAGAROONY.Fashion ♥♥♥ then stumbled across a town that sold boat items, and he got this thing called a captains seat. This is where things got worse. After this seat we still had around 3-4 thousand dollars left, so we sailed back to a level 2 towns in search for a tavern. And we found a tavern, and we got 3 new people. One, which is quite important, Shrek. Now I’m not saying this as a joke, the other 2 names were serious names and this one had a green shirt so fashion ♥♥♥ called him Shrek. But this person is very important. After these 3 new people things became...strange. And tbh the captains seat didn’t really do anything. But ah yes, this is when things became dodgy. The first sign on dodgyness was Fashion ♥♥♥ was becoming very depressed, and depended to be paid every 10 seconds or we would probably kill someone. But one day he didn’t get payed and just....snapped.Right after we destroyed a level 4 ship. He turned on everyone in the ship, and they were forced to fight back. Rave man then soon followed Fashion man, snapping and turning on everybody. Getting emotional again give me a minute.So they were 2 men down, and the beloved Fashion ♥♥♥ had finally died. Of course though, the next person in line was Abbo man, and he wanted change in the ship and no more incidents like this.Of course, the best solution was to buy 4 more irrelevant people and see what would happen, and guess what happened... well at this point nothing happened but were getting there.So Abbo man wanted to take over a ship because he just spent all of Fashion ♥♥♥♥ money. Everybody went onto the ship, Abbo man, party man, aghaghagh, Shrek, and everyone else that was still alive. They killed everybody in the ship then, it happened again, somebody turned.And guess who that somebody was. Abbo man. Abbo man turned on everybody, and then it lead to total disaster. Everybody turned, and there was only one person who was left in the end. ShrekWho was actually bleeding and died of blood loss 10 seconds after. The end.*All of this actually happened in Pixel Piracy. ** I was emotionally attached to almost every character in my ship *** I am now emotionally unstable'Do you recommend this game'?Well, I love the character part of things and the ships and battles and stuff. But its extremely glitchy for a full release, especially when there is lots of people on your boat. Another thing that started to happen was only the captain could move on the boat and everyone would start starving until I moved placesAnd of course, the moral of this story is that money is bad.

												Before this AMAZING new update Pixel Piracy was a filler, if I couldn't find a game I would play it until I found another game. The only reason I had bought it was it was 75% off. ( I got it WAY before this update, in December 2014) Now the game is awesome and i actually play it for fun, not as a filler. It is simply breathtaking the amount of stuff the Devs fixed, and I LOVE this game... BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please.			"

												Very fun game that they keep adding more and more content to. You start to get a connection with you're characters and beign able to customize their weapons and gear is the best. You get to the point where even though you've had jones from 3 days in, scallywag mcgee is just a better teamplayer so he gets to carry the big axe.Being able to build you're boat however you want is awesome, but if being artistic isnt your thing, just take the enemys! The pleasure you get from pushing plunder and watching their boat go up in an awesome explosion is the best feeling ever, the sound effect for it is awesome as well!10/10 - Would recommend, can't wait to see what they add next!

												This game is one of the best indie games i have ever played it is an instant crowd pleaser and i recommend it to any who enjoy strategy or simulation games..... The only problem i had was poision, because yeah i like exploring and adventureing my games and so when i saw spiders venom i totaly gave it to me and my crew because i thought it would poision their weapons and extra damage is always nice so of course it kills my crew and almost me but i had doctors aura and health potions so i made it; or should i say im making it because there is no anti venom or medicine you can take in game to get rid of it so the rest of the playthrough is going to feature a captin with floating green bubles around him.But other than that its an amazing game with a genuine story and an exellent arena mode where you can fight to gain experience in battle and distribution of items (like weapons which those with most stength would get the best of and ranged weapons which those with best dex would getthe best of) so if your ever in the mood for a gem of a game pixel piracy is a good choice.

								I have never enjoyed a game so thoroughly. There is so much to do in this game and it will fulfill many of your ambitions of piracy. The development is good and the content and Developer patches and input are quite frequent. One of the best purchases you will make. Supporting Indie games such as this increases the quality of games that we will see in the future. If you buy this you will not regret it.			"

												This is a fun little game that I think is well worth the money I paid for it.  The devs are responsive and the community is active.  Lots to recommend it.  I don't see myself going back to playing it again any time soon, however.  I like the current crop of rogue-likes quite a lot, permadeath and ridiculous difficulties are great with me.  My problem, though, is that I've run into three game-breaking bugs in the dozen or so hours that I've played it and at least one of them went away when I provided my save file to the devs.  They loaded it up, couldn't see the bug, gave me back the save and when I loaded up the one they gave me back I didn't see the bug either. These are the three I've hit:- my captain got 'stuck' trying to climb back aboard my ship when leaving an island.  I couldn't make him move back or foward, so I quit.  When I restarted the game I would get one second of activity before ""Game Over"" because my captain had fallen in the water and drowned.- my captain got 'stuck' on the far side of an island and couldn't move back through the various shops to the ship.  Even after reloading the game.- during a combat three of my crew fell off the island into the water and drowned.  As the game clearly states it does not save during combat, I reloaded the last save.  Which seemed to have happened immediately after the three crew members had drowned, a second before.The game is fun.  Make no mistake.  And usually your game will end the way any rogue-like ends, you'll die because some fight went against you because you under-estimated your opponent.  Occasionally, though, be prepared for the game itself to just smash your tower and make you start building over again.			"

												Very boring, I bought it for $2.50 on the holiday sale. Having coupons for it from Terraria (Great game) I though i would give it a try. I wasn't allowed to use my coupons,and I get a game that is not finished, is repetitive, and does not explain how to play at all. Overall, I can play a free game online that is like this but better. This feels as if I was scammed out of a game that had potential. Im deleting this from my Library, no doubt in my mind			"

												It surely isn't easy to begin and understand, but your patience will be rewarded. You begin with nothing more than a raft, all alone, and all you have got to do is get some money attacking other pirates and hunting treasures all over the map. Your objective: destroy the 4 legendary pirates.It could be very repetitive sometimes, and it's often based on the ""trial and error"" mechanic (that could be frustrating many times), but overall, it's a funny and interesting game. By the way, I miss a story behind our mission.Love this game, a very addictive one, but it could be way better. recommended specially for thougthful gamers. 9/10.			"

												If you like pirates, like the ocean, like being able to put your ship together the way you want, like being able to hire your own crew, then you'll like this game.You start out with the captain, which is you, controlled by your left mouse, and one crew member who's controlled by right mouse, you could start with 2 with the right starting perks. Every pirate, including your captain, has a passive equipment slot for various items, a melee weapon slot, a ranged weapon slot, and statistics. Strength, determines melee damage. Vitality,  determines max health, armor, movement speed, and health regen, Intelligence, determines how much extra experience your pirate gains from everything. Dexterity, determines ranged weapon accuracy, and damage. Agility, determines movement speed, and attack speed. Luck, determines your critical hit chance. The adventure starts at a level 1 town, with all the stores. Town's have different levels, I do not know the range yet, but I've seen it go up to 4, and this level determines whether they sell stronger, more useful items or not. Throughout the ocean you will encounter other pirate ships, you can either try to avoid them, or you can engage them in combat, fire cannons at their ship, or board it. When you win an engagement boaring the enemy ship, your pirates get experience, gold from their kills and sometimes enemies drop weapons or special items. You get the choice of whether to take over the ship and abandon your last one, or plunder it, gaining lots of gold, and a few ship parts. There's far more to the game than I say here, but these are the basics. I'd recommend getting this game, it's a great game, and you'll have fun, as well as a fine way to pass time, if this is in your library!			"

												This game is AMAZING!!!!! It is really easy to pick up and understand (took me like 5 minutes to get into the swing of it), has  a great soundtrack, very nice pixel graphics, fun gameplay, no glitches or bugs (i haven\'t encountered any) and a great customization system. This game just makes you feel really badaas as you plunder an enemy ship you just defeated, and use its parts to upgrade your own. Also I really like being able to equip each of my crew with different equipment and assign them to different roles. If I had any critism for this game, it would be that i would really like to raid towns, not just other ships and tribes. But other than that, this game is the ultimate 8-bit badaas pirate simulator.9.5/10Very good would recommend P.S. I would recommend listening to some Alestorm or other pirate music while playing because as good as the soundtrack is, it just doesen\'t make you feel very piratey and gets a bit repetetive.			"

												This game is more than what comes to the eye.Core Mechanics: You are a pirate. Your job is to aquire crew, bigger ships, money for food and items, and once strong enough to take on the great pirate overlords.-The world is randomly generated-Different pirates can be hired and given different abilities-Managing your crew breaks down to thier moral, hunger, and payment for service.-Build bigger ships with ship parts or simply plunder ones you take from enemies.-Upradealbe characters that can be given skills, gear, and form bonds with the player.-Fight the war on hunger, saddness, betrayal, the plague, and the savages and locals of the sea.Visuals/audio: The game takes your random characters and has them wobble about as they move around. Its simple, but pretty unique and adorable. The pixel graphics are well done, even if they try to use as few as possible for ""effect"". The animations are simple aswell, yet attacks have great nockback, sound effects from pistols and swords are oddly satisfying, and the little voices the pirates yell constantly gives them an aditional form of character.In the end, the game is a roguelike pirate managing adventure that becomes highly addictive and even if you fail you not only get a chance to try again in that instance, but next adventure you are smarter, more aware of how these seas work.The game was co-created by Re-Logic, the creators of Terraria. So I had fairly standard expectations. I was not dissapointed. This game is something fun to love and passes for a more simple, but satisfying rouge like pirate adventure.Happy Sailing mates. "

								Love the concept of this game. It is creative and the  idea of it is amazing. However after awhile it gets frustrating when you try to do things and can't get them to work. The gameplay/controls are not initutive and their is no tutorial for it. When I want a person on my crew to go do something I should be able to quickly click the person and then click what I want it to do. I am not going to give up on this game. I hope as it develops the quirks are fixed making the game fun and exciting from the very beginning instead of frustrating. I wish is that this review aids in the development of this so it lives up to its full potential.			"

								I've had this game for less than a week, and I've already pumped 24 hours into it. I've stayed up until 4 AM two nights in a row because I've been playing this game. It's really fun and really addicting.It has a bit of a learning curve. I had to play three or four games in order to actually get the hang of it. It can get really hard at points, and these points may cause a bunch of save-scumming. The game is also still in Early Access mode right now, so there are still a few bugs that need to be touched up and updates that need to happen. All in all, though, Pixel Piracy is incredibly fun, and I'd recommend it to anyone.			"

(recomendation they should be killable and be able to steal your food if you dont kill or scare them)  There are some flaws, such as i played through the entire game with only my captain. i got him to level 68 and was able to solo the 10.000 bosses with ease, slowly taking enemy ships i conquered along the way. just make sure to have plenty of rum and food or you will always lose. teach yourself or your crew basic clenliness (how to properly poop, or how to clean up others who dont know how) teach them to cook(as slow as possible), how to fight( but not how to dodge a cannon ball ), how to swim (directly to the sharks) and so much more. if you want a challenge get as many crew as you can strap them all with bombs (that are tirggered when they die) and fight on the enemy ship. (or your ship if you want a very fast end of game.) its always fun :)			"

								The game is still unbalanced and the pathfinding is terrible. I hope that it'll be solved in the near future.Even with these problems I recommend this game. You need a good strategy to step forward and it's pretty funny. However from my opinion it's not worth 14 euros but was an instant get on the sale. "

												Very fun game that they keep adding more and more content to. You start to get a connection with you're characters and beign able to customize their weapons and gear is the best. You get to the point where even though you've had jones from 3 days in, scallywag mcgee is just a better teamplayer so he gets to carry the big axe.Being able to build you're boat however you want is awesome, but if being artistic isnt your thing, just take the enemys! The pleasure you get from pushing plunder and watching their boat go up in an awesome explosion is the best feeling ever, the sound effect for it is awesome as well!10/10 - Would recommend, can't wait to see what they add next!

												This game is one of the best indie games i have ever played it is an instant crowd pleaser and i recommend it to any who enjoy strategy or simulation games..... The only problem i had was poision, because yeah i like exploring and adventureing my games and so when i saw spiders venom i totaly gave it to me and my crew because i thought it would poision their weapons and extra damage is always nice so of course it kills my crew and almost me but i had doctors aura and health potions so i made it; or should i say im making it because there is no anti venom or medicine you can take in game to get rid of it so the rest of the playthrough is going to feature a captin with floating green bubles around him.But other than that its an amazing game with a genuine story and an exellent arena mode where you can fight to gain experience in battle and distribution of items (like weapons which those with most stength would get the best of and ranged weapons which those with best dex would getthe best of) so if your ever in the mood for a gem of a game pixel piracy is a good choice.

												honestly i dont know where to start with this game, for the first few hours you will probably have the most fun, running around, killing things, capturing animals and plundering ships, and all your crew will do their jobs and you wont pay an arm and a leg, then you get far(like i have) and have a crew of 5, and im only level 75, but after one fight(about 5 minutes of gameplay) i owe like 300 gold for just their salaries... how the hell am i gunna make money that way? then they stopped doing their skills!!! what the hell am i paying the crew for? they dont cook, no one cleans(even though we all have that skill) and we are starving to death but they refuse to cook! the ship is damaged and none of the crew i have stated for repairs will even lift a finger to fix it! then between the random suicides of falling off the ship, to overpowered enemies with high knockback, its a wonder how this game got so faras it is! i see very high hopes, but a lot of much much MUCH needed work. many issues with fps staying up, for some reason it slows down and starts to lag at random intervals to the point where the game is almost unplayable, and it hasnt happened to just me either! please start making huge updates, and the content is ok, but half the people dont know how to obtain the items, hell, i dont even know how to obtain all the items, some say they come from chests, which chests? ship chests or island ones? and i killed a legendary boss but got no special drops. also ranging in this gamme is a very hard build... why do i always have to have a mele weapon, but cant choose just a ranged one? i wanted to use only pistols, but thats impossible. and they are so slow, but they can be very powerful. i like the pet system, i used monkeys and spiders, both of which gain hp for each level, turtles dont gain hit points, and parrots... the only way for me to obtain a parrot is if i catch it, and choose to keep the ship it was on, it never mounts me(or anyone in the crew) to leave the ship! so i usually kill them. my men also have issues climbing over blocks, and sometimes dont listen when i click and tell them to go anywhere. i also dont know how factions work... i go online and see people can have an encounter that isnt hostile... but im level 75 and done plenty of missions, and killed a legendary and still dont get anything other than hostile ship interceptions. this game is fun though when it doesnt bug, i hope they make it possible to duel weild(double mele or double ranged) or allow me to be fully ranged to stay at a distance. and i hope to see them fix the morale issues like, at once. and obviously the issues of crew doing nothing at all, really annoys me. this game has a ton of potential, but they need to fix the issues before they start putting in customizeations. but id love to see more customizations when the bugs are fixed, colors to ships, textures, maybe even different wood,  hopefully you will allow us to pic the size of our sails? that would be awesome. but please fix the bugs, makes me kinda regret buying the game now instead of waiting=\			"

												Full disclosure - I got this game for 0.99. I think that this is a wonderful game for what I paid for it. I wouldn't pay full price.The concept is super-cool: pirates, retro graphics, levelling, the weird CRT-like blur to the graphics. The game is fun, 3 hours in, but I could see it wearing thin.Cons: This game has a confusing UI. WTF?!?! doesn't it respond when I click? And why do I have to use a mouse when I don't want to?So bottom-line: If you can get this game cheap, go to town, you'll have fun with it. I really hope the developers or someone else improve upon the execution, as the game's concept is great. "

If you purchase it on sale for $0.99 then you really cannot go wrong. If you like the idea of becoming a PIRATE LORD from the ground up then please give this one a go. I havent had as much fun with a pixelated game since terraria...GEE I WONDER WHY?Its basically a pixelated rpg focused on encountering enemy ships and randomized islands. There is not a lot of variance with either but thats okay since your not looking for a triple A title here.

												This charming game is a heck of a lot of fun when you get into it, it does have some flaws which mean i probably won't be returning to play the game now i have ""beaten"" it and killed the 4 pirate lords. A few changes i would love to see includeBetter controlling of crew/Better AI - I'm talking about pathfinding and also i would love to have a little ""fire the cannons!"" button, to controll when my gunners are firing and perhaps even the ability to assign a cannon to a particular gunner.reworked cleaning process, by the end of my playthrough i have about 5 or 6 wedges of poo stuck in my ship which i can't remove because the rules of the game dictate you cannot remove a block if a piece of poo is near that block. My suggestion for at least a quick fix for now is having a boat washing shop on the town islands that will clean all current poo off your ship.Framerates - Sometimes the game just dramatically drops in frames, most of the time i'm at 60 but sometimes it really starts to drop and the only way to fix it is by restarting the game, i'm not an expert in these types of things but isn't that a memory leak or something?you canr really tell alot of love has gone into this game and I feel the price of the game is right for what you are getting so i deffinitly would reccomend this game! :D			"

												I really enjoy the game, but after a little time I realize the game have a serious problem of commanding your pirates, like on a fight you can do nothing if someone is dieing, they will keep fighting untill death. Another thing what is annoying is the knockback of some weapons, and the water, who you cant swim if you dont have the perk of swiming.			"

												This game is is a fecal resource management sim. Your pirates did not have mothers and just poop everywhere. The other half is some basic combat and poke-mon-esque capturing of animals to have them fight for you. The game is always being updated, which is good, and for the price I paid, I think it is worth a buy. Evevn at full retail.			"

								Pixel Piracy is an amazing game that even the description says it contains 10 hours of content there is a lot more. As the game is still in Alpha it provides a lot of funny moments that you and your crewmates will never forget, also game is not easy and you will find yourself plucking a bit of hair from here and there from time to time.

												Controls are a mess, menus are atrocious. Customization is almost exclusively random. Music is non-existent. Sounds are annoying. The tutorial and in-game descriptions are riddled with typos and spelling mistakes. Combat is... clunky at best.Given that this is supposedly from the creators of Terraria.The concept is great and the foundations are there, but the developers seem to have not done anything with them. I have played this game pre-release, and I have to say there has to be something horribly wrong with the game if it's actually worse in its current state than when I first played it, a year ago, or two.I would have expected a product that compares to or exceeds Terraria in quality, instead of feeling like what a 10-year-old would have made after an afternoon of messing around in Game Maker. I get the feeling that someone's top priority was to push out a game ASAP and make quick money instead of producing a game that will stay relevant for years.3/10, would not recommend even if you can get it for free.

								At first, the game seemed fine. After all, you could sail the seas and plunder the hell out of everywhere, which was supposed to be fun, right?Then, I started to get annoyed by the poop. The sight of poop and the sound of poop every ten seconds is really annoynig and it gets even worse if you have a large crew. And the game becomes boring and repetitive even before buying cannons. And the story is also repetitive even at the first hour. Attack islands, kill the treasure guards, loot the chest. Attack ships, loot the treasure, plunder them if you manage to not sink them if you have cannons. Or if you are really high level, attack towns and take the gold. Nothing else, except for the events which are either you getting exp or crew wanting money.The graphics are at the level of some basic flash game but is too resource heavy for non-gaming computers, which is why I bought this at the first place. And mind you, it can run games (at low specs) like Minecraft, M&B, Bioshock etc.  smoothly but not this. So don't buy this thinking it is easy to run.The combat is also too boring. It is essentially random and also stupid: a turtle or a chicken can deal more damage than a sword...And it gets frustrating when the guy kicking the endless stream of poop every second with the worst algorithm I've ever seen (instead of cleaning the nearest poop, it goes for a random one) and the sound... god...It is funny in a silly way at the first couple of hours but gets incredibly annoying with the repeating sounds (poop+kick) and places and missions.

								I was severly dissapointed by what the actual gameplay tuned out to be. Starting with 2 crew memebers who never shut up and having the ship immobile and simply picking encounters that come to you... I only played for about 30 minutes but i saw no reason to play for longer, the game looks like a grind to earn gold and visually unappealing in every aspect. 'Pixel art doesnt mean you cheap out on animations, having the characters wobble around to indicate every action is just lazy, and having white text on a black screen tell you an encounter is coming is even more lazy than having the ship wobble up to you.

Early Access Review
								Played this on PC for a while, was amused but the game is more broken than fun. Now returning after updates I find that it is less broken, but also absurdly less fun. Let us review..The difficulty of this game shifts wildly from easy to the point of boredom to how-the-hell-am-I-supposed-to-do-anything. Often times this shift doesn't even require you to begin a new game, rather you just have a small stroke of bad luck and suddenly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t abounds. The easiest example of this are the islands that are everywhere. You explore them at the beginning and find but a few enemies, if you're lucky they are pirates with similar health and weapons, luckier still its just a group of monkies with a chest. Those are not typical encounters. Rather the vast majority of the time you will find the island literally infested with more enemies than you have crew, each with better weapons than you can buy, and each indivudually having more health than your entire crew combined. That's not a challenge, that's locking off an entire section of the game. Ok, you might think to yourself, I guess I can come back later with more pirates/weapons/skills/etc and do this. You can, but only for those islands that you have explored and thus locked down their difficulty. The more you grow your crew the more the absurd scale of the island difficulty tries to be vertical. I'm at the point where I effectively ignore them unless I feel like watching my crew get slaughtered by BOARS.Now with a signifigant portion of the game rendered effectively gone lets address the pirate ships. Those are definitely fun...for a while...which is to say up until danger level 4. Once the idiots start getting cannons it become an exercise in frustration as you bumrush the cannoneers to stop them from blowing up and sinking their own ship and killing everyone. You would think that those who carry explosives aboard their ships would provide more than a single layer of wood between them and a watery death. This also raises serious questions about the usefulness of cannons aboard your own ship, since a few shots from you might cause the same destruction leaving you with nothing for your troubles except some debt since you now need more cannonballs. That's fun.OH, I almost forgot about the AI, though intelligence is rather a strong term for what I've seen my pirates do. Lets say you're going to try and be tricky to take an island you explored that has less than 15 enemies with 300 health that hit for 20+ damage. You notice they are spread out and figure you can mob them individually without losing everyone. So you land, you drag the attack icon to a guy and watch as everyone proceeds to sprint past them and die...Ok reload and try again, maybe you misclicked or something. Nope, attack icon doesn't seem to actually direct anyone...right click? Nope. Hrm... I should also mention that getting all of your pirates to actually do anything is a miracle in itself. I can't count the number of times I've ordered my men to board a ship only to find that 3-4 just decided ""Nah"" and are hanging around my ship causing unnecessary losses. Even better should you spam right click to get the lazy buggers over there it is entirely possible that a few of your pirates already on the enemy ship decide that your orders mean they should go back home. Now since new targets have opened up some of your own pirates may gleefully decide to run the gauntlet of every other enemy on the ship and die. There seem to be new features being added, which is good, like the bounty/wanted boards...buuut you can't seem to put them off until later? Yeah sure my and my one other crewmate will go after this dude, that makes sense. If you tell it to♥♥♥♥♥♥off, like you probably will 99.99% of the time, then it mocks you and will never activate again.Don't even get me started on the voices...for the love of god the voices. I would rather they not even be there instead of listening to the same damn line over...and over...every time I take an action or just because they happen to be talking to the crew. ♥♥♥♥ hearing my captain say ""Loser"" or ""Land HO"" about 2000 times just makes me turn the sound off entirely. That's disappointing because the sound is actually pretty good.I keep coming back to this game because it seems like it should be fun, and playing drunk is pretty great, but I always leave frusterated and annoyed that I wasted time and money on this.

Cuz a lots of things bother players are not bugs. Such as a chief donnot cook if he have the skill of fishing; more cleaning skill, more time needed to clean the poops, odd, right? Third, it is really boring if u have played 6 or 7 hours or more, cuz u can do nothing but killing killing and the battles are so similiar with each other.And a big bug is one of the four legency enemies, donnot have the captain....Speechless.that means u cannot FINISH it logically. :DIN ONE WORD, interesting in 6hours, boring after that. BUG is not the biggest problem,but inconvience do.			"

												So I've decided to write a short review for those of you deciding on whether or not this title is for you. Let me clarify; it's not for everyone. This game is a lot of exploration, repeditive battles, and also has an exhaling amount of frusteration if you so choose to play on the more difficult settings. However this game is a well built ""simulation"". It provides fun and relaxing moods with some very beautfiul water settings and also islands. You have the ability to build and customize ships to your liking, hire an abundent amount of crew, play ""pokemon"" and catch animals in cages, and also plunder and must your way through pirates, colonials, and islanders. Overall this game is a work of art, I recommend it to those of you who want something to do for a couple hours at a time. Like I said it's not for everyone and even myself (Particuallry liking this game) can't play it for more than couple hours at a time. That being said you will enjoy it, and if achievements are your thing than this game has serveral easy ones. Not to mention the steam trading cards are fairley cheap as well. So in the end, yes Pixal Piracy is a great game and you should definately check it out.			"

								Pixel Piracy is a pretty damng cool game. Nothing like it is currently on the market. Youre at the mercy of RNG (random number generator) a lot of the time, but its done well enough to where its not too obvious. Customization has gotten much better over the last year ive had this game. Truthfully I play it for a week straight, then run into issues or bugs, and I put it down for a month. Those issues, plus new content, are then fixed/added. Feels almost like a new game each time. However there hasnt been a build of the game ive played without at least one HUGE issue. I think the game is over priced at 15$, I got it for 5$ and im positively happy with having got my money's worth.			"

Some other basics, like how to clean poo (its a silly joke which gets old fast) in a game where you don't get certain items, are never explained well. Perhaps if this game was completly remade with a better UI in mind, it might be fun, but for now, it's a silly mobile like game not worth much.			"

												Hello, it is DraganSlayer69 here bringing you another crappy review on another terrible game. If you are looking for a good game, this could be your lovely match. The story is quick, simple, and down to the point. As soon as I spawned in, I had the weirdest, gayest moans ever. The people just scream common pirate chants and annoying shouts.Anyway, I thought it looked a lot like Terraria.Then, Terraria reminded me of Starbound, and after that Edge of Space, and then it reminded me of ... what was that game called? ... oh yeah Pixel Piracy. Oh, that is the game I am writing a review about.You basically have to kill 4 Legendary Pirate Captains and then ""Rule the Seven Seas""Yo Ho Ho and Shiver me big long Timber because Pixel Piracy is actually a good game.

												So when I first started out playing I had no idea what was happening and my whole crew had died in a matter of minutes. All I had left was my captain and this super frickin' tiny boat that I could do nothing in. i rage-quited, but then 2 days later ,after I had looked at some strategy guides, I came back to it and started a new world. It. Was. Awesome. Everything is so inventive and the stratgey and having to figure all these awesome new things out and trying not to bite off more than you can chew but also trying to fight pirates and island that are just above your level limit. that may have made no sense to you so let me put this simply. BUY IT!!!!!			"

												Great concept like so many games, but this game never got tweaked (or done properly). Its too old now for updates/renwing.Main problem: The sheer drop in FPS once you get so many crew members or your ship becomes so big. In the end I was playing on 2-5fps and that was just for the achievements. For some reason the last time I played the ahievements wern't working but this play through they did...I wouldn't bother with it tbh. Hopefully the Devs or someone realize this was a good idea, and release Pixel Piracy 2, or something along those lines.			"

								I know its pixel art... But I guess I didn't realize it was that bad.  It's really the only thing that makes me say ""No"" to it.  I have quite a few pixel art looking games, and they're just better looking.  Other than the graphics, it's ok. The talking from the other mates gets a bit annoying, but the idea of the game is pretty cool. If you like very blocky pixel art, go for it, if not, move on.			"

												I love pirate themed games more so than the average guy, I bought Pixel Piracy over 6 months ago and loved it initially. I knew of several bugs that made the game difficult, so I decided to wait until it was properly done.The game has now been properly released and I've played about 20 minutes before I encountered a few game breaking bugs.My captain would sail endlessly without getting to the desired location and continiously level up, the menu wouldnt pop up to escape and I had to terminate the program (attempts to play on the same save made the bug recur, which is a pain if you're far into the game).I didnt care at first and simply made a new save, but then I encountered a bug that was common when the game was still in early access, the pirates wouldnt use their skills and poop would cover the ship. This would lower moral and eventually lead the crew to mutiny (unless you changed ships constantly and paid your crew). There are a few more bugs i wont mention, but they still caused quite a bit of frustration and heartache when trying to fix or work around them.I loved this game, I really did. However after encountering so many bugs I have grown to hate it. I'd only reccomend this game if it was on sale and not at full price			"

												This game has been out for 2 years and still has the most obnoxious bugs in it. The concept of pixel piracy was a fantastic idea, but the game seems like it was abandoned by the developers. Imagine spending 4+ hours on your captain then having him drop ♥♥♥♥ing dead for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason at at all. I stayed up until 5am on my first captain and he  made it all the way to level 11 when his health randomly started to ♥♥♥♥ing deteriorate. I checked his stats; he wasn't bleeding, he wasn't hungry, nor was he sick. He just dropped ♥♥♥♥ing dead. The bugs have made it unplayable; crew dying at random, crew ignores my frequent attempts to get them to fish for food and decides to ♥♥♥♥ing practice sword fighting with a fishing rod instead, random lagspikes when you call your crew from a town, etc. The devs need to get off their asses and polish this almost perfect game. Until these bugs are fixed, you shouldn't consider buying this product.			"

												I could barely tell what anything was. It seems that because you slap the title ""Pixel"" pn a game it's an excuse to be really shotty with the graphics. No, graphics don't make the game, but it's more than a little anoying when you can barely tell what things are. On top of that, the game almost seemed unplayable. You can't just jump into the game and play, and that's the shortfall of so many indi games these days.			"

												Now that this game has been released, I can write this review for a released game.While I was playing in the beta, I saw a lot of potential for this game.  It seemed almost like the Sims, with pirates and swashbuckling and all the greatness you want from piracy.  You can recruit your crew and equip each member with weapons and skills to make your pirate crew a fearesome force on the open seas.That being said, the implementation is far from perfect.  A lot of the tooltips seem off point, like the training swords that you can get to put on your ship state ""Training is for the weak"".  Until you actually buy them, you don't actually realize this is a part for your ship that allows your crew member to gain XP.  Town notations have messed up spacing.  Many items' functionality is left unknown to the player until they actually use it, which is awful considering that everything is the game feels very expensive (at least in the beginning).The biggest issue I have with the game is the AI.  I was constantly fighting the AI with what it wanted to do against what I needed to do (or it needed to do, for that matter).  For example, I had a fisher on my crew, who should be providing fish for the crew to eat.  Instead, the AI wants him to go to the training swords and gain XP.  Every time I try to take him off the training swords, he takes two steps off the swords, then goes right back to them.  Meanwhile, my crew is starving (and dying).  My Captain, starving, prefers to stay at the training swords instead of eat, so then he dies.  In combat, I try to remove heavily wounded crew members from the enemy, but they take a few steps away and attempt to attack again.This game had a lot of good ideas and I wanted to be an awesome pirate captain, but I spent most of my time fighting the AI that should be making my experience more fluid and playing ""guess its purpose"" on every item I found and/or bought.  Note to the developer(s): if you are having trouble making something automatic, leave it to the player, and only automate it when you know with 99% certainty that the palyer will want it.  For example, if a pirate is starving, go eat.  If the player has to send the pirate to the training swords manually, it is better than removing the control from the player.			"

												I will rate this game based on the following things:Art/GraphicsMusic/SoundContentMechanicsUpdatesArt/Graphics - 4/10What you're looking at onscreen isn't always clear as the pixelated art is very blurry. The style of art doesn't fit the feel of the game as it feels very weird. You cannot zoom in either to see what's going on more clearly.Music/Sound - 3/10There isn't much many sound effects and if there are, they are drowned out by the music. The music is pirate themed, but there's only one track and it gets very annoying very quickly. The music is not very good, either, in my opinion.Content - 1/10There are only 3 types of places to go and that's it. It may be open world, but every place you go to is pretty much identical to some other place you've visited. A lot of the time you're playing the game, you're waiting for 2 minutes to go to the next location.Mechanics - 2/10The mechanics never change from the beginning of the game. Fighting other ships is boring and land combat is exactly the same. Nothing new happens as you progress except that you get more materials to build your ship and more crew members. But with those things, you're still doing everything you did when you started out, but on a larger scale.Updates - 2/10The Steam page says that there is constant updates, but the updates aren't constant and they mostly consist of a few bug fixes. However, there is a couple of tiny content additions every so often.Total - 24/100The developers have given up on this and it was released was to early. It is extremely unpolished.			"

												It would seem they fixed anything that any old review migh have issue with. This game is so much fun. Its adorably entertaining and has plenty of humor. Stat managing and maintaining order on your ship is the main aspect while you take other ships, add to your own, and collect a vast collection of pets, treasure, and crew.The only issue is controls but they do everything they can to get you used to how things work, notably with many help and tutorial options and as soon as its done, you can get on your way.This game has made me excited with its charm and its interestingly new layout.

												I got the game at a bundle for peanuts money and it wasnt great a first but after I played for a while i stoppedafter a month or two i played it again it was fun, the game is pretty simple and its not too challenging if you dont choose to take risks but i think its a fun game.in the game you pretty much hire pirates level them up give the ones you like some skills so they wont die and improve your ship over and over with cannos and decorations. the game is enjoyable on its own but you wont find yourself playing hours and hours to no end.  I like the art style or more correctly like the coloring and dont hate the art style which is sadly a good thing for indie games and not a normal thing. i give the game a thumb up because it costed me near to nothing it was like a bonus to a bunch of great games and i played about 10 hours of this and every so often i play a little more and it is still fun and enjoiable to me.P.S. its improtant to get poop cleaning mastery from a misk shop cause its the only way to clean poop, teach about one pirate every five pirates (and one early on)			"

												Pixel Piracy seems to play out like a bad mix-up of Terraria (with just about none of the good features of this game) and Sid Meier's Pirates! (with just about none of the good features of this game), with all the freedom to... fight a pirate on a ship. Fight more pirates on more ships. Fight animals on land. Fight tribal men on land. Have your crew kill each other over time despite high morale. Enjoy poop jokes (poop deck. Get it?). Be annoyed by the interface and the lack of meaningful controls.All in all, this game plays like an early Alpha. Of a free game. Not something you'd have to pay for. 1/10			"

												I hired a crew member and took an emeny ship. While trying to figure out how to plunder it I first picked up my other crew member, and when I put him down he jumped overboard and drowned.Apparently pirates can't swim.Still not seeing any way to plunder it I returned to my own ship thinking maybe it was automatic. When I tried to sail on the game warned me that I hadn't plundered or captured the enemy ship, so I tried to board it again, then spotted the plunder button was now enabled so I clicked it.Well, the enemy ship exploded while my captain was mid-flight between my ship and the enemy ship, and without anything to land on he just kept flying... He's dead now.R.I.P. Captain DarkStarSwordNot a great first impression - the game definitely needs more polish. It might get better further in, but my attention span is too short for that. On the positive side I'm loving the sound track :)			"

												It has potential but there are several game breaking bugs (requiring restart) and a great number of other issues such as fishermen letting the crew starve to death because they'd rather play cards than fish unless they themselves are starving.It might turn out a good game later on and seems to be patched frequently. At the moment I cannot reccomend it though.			"

												Now that this game has been released, I can write this review for a released game.While I was playing in the beta, I saw a lot of potential for this game.  It seemed almost like the Sims, with pirates and swashbuckling and all the greatness you want from piracy.  You can recruit your crew and equip each member with weapons and skills to make your pirate crew a fearesome force on the open seas.That being said, the implementation is far from perfect.  A lot of the tooltips seem off point, like the training swords that you can get to put on your ship state ""Training is for the weak"".  Until you actually buy them, you don't actually realize this is a part for your ship that allows your crew member to gain XP.  Town notations have messed up spacing.  Many items' functionality is left unknown to the player until they actually use it, which is awful considering that everything is the game feels very expensive (at least in the beginning).The biggest issue I have with the game is the AI.  I was constantly fighting the AI with what it wanted to do against what I needed to do (or it needed to do, for that matter).  For example, I had a fisher on my crew, who should be providing fish for the crew to eat.  Instead, the AI wants him to go to the training swords and gain XP.  Every time I try to take him off the training swords, he takes two steps off the swords, then goes right back to them.  Meanwhile, my crew is starving (and dying).  My Captain, starving, prefers to stay at the training swords instead of eat, so then he dies.  In combat, I try to remove heavily wounded crew members from the enemy, but they take a few steps away and attempt to attack again.This game had a lot of good ideas and I wanted to be an awesome pirate captain, but I spent most of my time fighting the AI that should be making my experience more fluid and playing ""guess its purpose"" on every item I found and/or bought.  Note to the developer(s): if you are having trouble making something automatic, leave it to the player, and only automate it when you know with 99% certainty that the palyer will want it.  For example, if a pirate is starving, go eat.  If the player has to send the pirate to the training swords manually, it is better than removing the control from the player.			"

But the game literals is still really big. On the study of the Raiders, search the few tricks, I still didn't play that some important operation is not clear, muddleheaded play more than 8 hours, knowing that the crew that may not be what, but still curious about what is being said, then in use translation software, typing level has been significantly improved. In general only to play this, to experience the fun of the game, and the pain, after all, do not understand and rely on translation software to play the effect of game on with foreign friends see I use translation software evaluation of feeling almost, helpless or finished.Say so much in the final word, the game is very interesting, if it is possible, please translate into Chinese, thank you.(终于领略了机翻的强大)很少评测，语言可能会有些混乱，因为看了王老菊的视频感觉蛮喜欢这个游戏，就开始刻苦的玩了，为什么刻苦呢，因为英语水平太差，只能边开着翻译软件边玩，感觉玩游戏玩到这个地步也算是刻苦了。不过这个游戏文字量还真大，在研究了几篇攻略，搜索了几个窍门之后，我还是没玩明白，一些重要的操作尚不清楚，就稀里糊涂玩了8个多小时，明知道船员的说明可能并没有什么用，但还是好奇到底说的是什么，于是在使用中翻译软件的过程中，打字水平得到了显著地提高。总的来说只能先玩到这了，体验到了游戏的乐趣，和痛苦，毕竟看不明白，靠翻译软件玩游戏的效果就跟外国友人看我这篇用软件翻译出来的评测的感觉差不多吧，还是无奈的等汉化吧。说了这么多归根结底一句话，游戏很有意思，如果有可能请翻译成中文，谢谢。			"

												I feel like I gave this game a good chance to wow me, as I played it for a little more than an hour. But in that hour I felt like I saw everything that Pixel Piracy had to offer. The clunky menu, unintuitive skill system, and lackluster tutorial all combined to form a game that I struggled to enjoy. If you absolutely have to see this game for yourself, I would recommend buying this on sale. I had my doubts about this game after seeing a youtuber play it, but I wanted to give it a fair chance. I suggest that if you have any doubts or misgivings about this game, then trust your hunch and give this one a pass.			"

												Opinion:  This unfinished premise of a game is the gold standard for Early Access Cash Grabbing. The game is buggy, unstable, and is more of a tech demo than a game. The developer took the money earned on this title in Early Access and abandoned it.Do not buy this game, or any other game that this developer puts into EA. Wait until any/all of his future titles are actually released, and then based your decision on that.			"

												Pixel Piracy seems to play out like a bad mix-up of Terraria (with just about none of the good features of this game) and Sid Meier's Pirates! (with just about none of the good features of this game), with all the freedom to... fight a pirate on a ship. Fight more pirates on more ships. Fight animals on land. Fight tribal men on land. Have your crew kill each other over time despite high morale. Enjoy poop jokes (poop deck. Get it?). Be annoyed by the interface and the lack of meaningful controls.All in all, this game plays like an early Alpha. Of a free game. Not something you'd have to pay for. 1/10			"

												I love pirate themed games more so than the average guy, I bought Pixel Piracy over 6 months ago and loved it initially. I knew of several bugs that made the game difficult, so I decided to wait until it was properly done.The game has now been properly released and I've played about 20 minutes before I encountered a few game breaking bugs.My captain would sail endlessly without getting to the desired location and continiously level up, the menu wouldnt pop up to escape and I had to terminate the program (attempts to play on the same save made the bug recur, which is a pain if you're far into the game).I didnt care at first and simply made a new save, but then I encountered a bug that was common when the game was still in early access, the pirates wouldnt use their skills and poop would cover the ship. This would lower moral and eventually lead the crew to mutiny (unless you changed ships constantly and paid your crew). There are a few more bugs i wont mention, but they still caused quite a bit of frustration and heartache when trying to fix or work around them.I loved this game, I really did. However after encountering so many bugs I have grown to hate it. I'd only reccomend this game if it was on sale and not at full price			"

												I will rate this game based on the following things:Art/GraphicsMusic/SoundContentMechanicsUpdatesArt/Graphics - 4/10What you're looking at onscreen isn't always clear as the pixelated art is very blurry. The style of art doesn't fit the feel of the game as it feels very weird. You cannot zoom in either to see what's going on more clearly.Music/Sound - 3/10There isn't much many sound effects and if there are, they are drowned out by the music. The music is pirate themed, but there's only one track and it gets very annoying very quickly. The music is not very good, either, in my opinion.Content - 1/10There are only 3 types of places to go and that's it. It may be open world, but every place you go to is pretty much identical to some other place you've visited. A lot of the time you're playing the game, you're waiting for 2 minutes to go to the next location.Mechanics - 2/10The mechanics never change from the beginning of the game. Fighting other ships is boring and land combat is exactly the same. Nothing new happens as you progress except that you get more materials to build your ship and more crew members. But with those things, you're still doing everything you did when you started out, but on a larger scale.Updates - 2/10The Steam page says that there is constant updates, but the updates aren't constant and they mostly consist of a few bug fixes. However, there is a couple of tiny content additions every so often.Total - 24/100The developers have given up on this and it was released was to early. It is extremely unpolished.			"

There are posts about what went wrong during development, but in the end they put out a product that didn't deliver what they said it would.

I recommend it if and only if it got sales or bundle. It has it good sides just it is very unpolished.			"

I URGE STEAM TO HAVE A REFUND POLICY OR ELSE WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE GREATER LEGAL MEASURES AGAINST STEAM AND THE DEVELOPERS WHO KEEPS FEEDING ILL-GAMING EXPERIENCES AND A SEVERE WASTE OF MY MONEY AND MY TIME...  AT THE VERY LEAST EVERY GAME SHOULD HAVE A DEMO AND UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO DAILY OR AT LEAST WEEKLY UPDATES. PS. I PLAYED FOR ABOUT 10 STRAIGHT HOURS BEFORE I REALIZED I LOST MY PROGRESS AND FAME...         I DEMAND SATISFACTION! "

												I will rate this game based on the following things:Art/GraphicsMusic/SoundContentMechanicsUpdatesArt/Graphics - 4/10What you're looking at onscreen isn't always clear as the pixelated art is very blurry. The style of art doesn't fit the feel of the game as it feels very weird. You cannot zoom in either to see what's going on more clearly.Music/Sound - 3/10There isn't much many sound effects and if there are, they are drowned out by the music. The music is pirate themed, but there's only one track and it gets very annoying very quickly. The music is not very good, either, in my opinion.Content - 1/10There are only 3 types of places to go and that's it. It may be open world, but every place you go to is pretty much identical to some other place you've visited. A lot of the time you're playing the game, you're waiting for 2 minutes to go to the next location.Mechanics - 2/10The mechanics never change from the beginning of the game. Fighting other ships is boring and land combat is exactly the same. Nothing new happens as you progress except that you get more materials to build your ship and more crew members. But with those things, you're still doing everything you did when you started out, but on a larger scale.Updates - 2/10The Steam page says that there is constant updates, but the updates aren't constant and they mostly consist of a few bug fixes. However, there is a couple of tiny content additions every so often.Total - 24/100The developers have given up on this and it was released was to early. It is extremely unpolished.			"

												ARRR Here be a fine swashbucklin adventure. Full of twists and turns and sailors who cannot swim, even when their very lives depend on it.This game was painful to begin with. I died a lot.I found that you have to grind your way through so many ship encounters to get the resources required to get anywhere.My first boss fight was brutal, I watched each one of my sailors get butchered and die a painful bloody death.To avoid being out gunned and out matched try the following;-Start the game with long nights option.-Give your sailors fast learner.-Don't worry about poop on the deck during the early game, you can always capture somone elses ship.-Never use standard cannons, only swivel cannons.-Catch spiders as pets, they rock.-Pandas look cool, but they are rubbish as pets.-Never place your ammo on deck, or within four squares of something the enemy ships can hit.-Sell everything. I Have managed to grind my way through to completion once or twice. You get a sense of accomplishment when you mow down the final ship. "

												10 out of 10. people randomly poop. im sold.in all realness, i am having a lot of fun with the game. even if i dont have much time in it. but i feel that is has the suddle. rpg charm to it. which makes the game a lot of fun, the game also has a nice balance of being both hard, and easy at times. you could be over whelmed 2v3, or the game will throw a 2v1 at you. the only thing that is stoping it from happening is the level limits. you will never find your self in a battle that is 100% garenteed lose. as for the bad things about the game, i dont like the way the game looks at times. things kind of seem to mush together at times. its not the falt of the game by any means. its just how it is, and how its going to be. its still a lot of fun, and i can see my self playing it for quite a while.

												As far as the previous posts about glitches and whatnot, if you read whats been posted recently a massive update is being released on 1/29.After playing the game for this long the only problem that drives me nuts is after I gathered a crew of >12 for some reason when I would send them to battle another ship 2 or 3 of my mateys would sit on top of the enemies ship to be hit then knocked into the depts of the ocean to be baried with davey jones locker. Yes the crew likes to poop but if you give every member the perk/stat/attribute of ""cleaning"" then that problem goes away. If you think your wasting a slot, think again, each crew member has a lot of available slots to give upgrades to.The game is fun and simple, build a crew, build a ship, travel around, micromanage your people, upgrade, then rinse and repeat. What others find annoying I find a fun challange. Its not game breaking you just have to be more open to unusual challanges. Its excellent to play between classes as there is nothing that keeps you from quiting that doesnt take a few minutes at max.			"

												VERY IN SHORT : Conditional Recommend! Ambitious game which disappoints with shallow mechanics, yet can still entertain! Buy on sale if you like its pirate concept!-----Pixel Piracy is a unique little game with many interesting ideas on board, but overall fails to deliver on most of them with sadly shallow game mechanics and a very clunky UI. However if the concept they are pitching appeals to you, it is not hard to sail through quite a few hours messing around building different ships and acquiring and training a crew into full blown battle-hardened pirates. There really is no other game that I know of which offers exactly what Vitali Kirpu and Alexander Poysky have dreamed up here. Indeed other pirate games exist on the market which do a lot of what Pixel Piracy does, and in most cases they do it better. However the ability to create your own ship from scratch, and hire individual crew members to man it into ship to ship battle, or an island raid alongside you certainly adds a certain charm to this game which sets it apart from the rest in the pirate genre. Unforunately the most endearing part of the game is marred by exactly what should enhance it. Exploration can be tedious as all islands look essentially the same, and contain little to nothing to do outside of fighting enemies. (Though there are towns, they aren't much better.) All in all I feel that this is a game that, had the developers put in a little more love and the necessary time to flesh out the existing mechanics and add a few new ones, could have been the next big indie game. Though as it stands it feels more like an Android or iOs game, I can only recommend one to pick it up while its on sail (yahar!), but only if you are a fan of the genre or the concepts on offer appeal to you.-----Note: I understand that although the game is technically 'released', they have hired someone who is currently working on Pixel Piracy updating and adding new content to the game. If my opinion changes based upon this, I will update this review.			"

												I hired a crew member and took an emeny ship. While trying to figure out how to plunder it I first picked up my other crew member, and when I put him down he jumped overboard and drowned.Apparently pirates can't swim.Still not seeing any way to plunder it I returned to my own ship thinking maybe it was automatic. When I tried to sail on the game warned me that I hadn't plundered or captured the enemy ship, so I tried to board it again, then spotted the plunder button was now enabled so I clicked it.Well, the enemy ship exploded while my captain was mid-flight between my ship and the enemy ship, and without anything to land on he just kept flying... He's dead now.R.I.P. Captain DarkStarSwordNot a great first impression - the game definitely needs more polish. It might get better further in, but my attention span is too short for that. On the positive side I'm loving the sound track :)			"

No, graphics don't make the game, but it's more than a little anoying when you can barely tell what things are. On top of that, the game almost seemed unplayable. You can't just jump into the game and play, and that's the shortfall of so many indi games these days.			"

Let me rephrase that, it WOULD be if I could actually click on anything. For some reason every single time I click the game registers the click as being way further to the right than where I actually click.

												Great concept like so many games, but this game never got tweaked (or done properly). Its too old now for updates/renwing.Main problem: The sheer drop in FPS once you get so many crew members or your ship becomes so big. In the end I was playing on 2-5fps and that was just for the achievements. For some reason the last time I played the ahievements wern't working but this play through they did...I wouldn't bother with it tbh. Hopefully the Devs or someone realize this was a good idea, and release Pixel Piracy 2, or something along those lines.			"

												I got the game at a bundle for peanuts money and it wasnt great a first but after I played for a while i stoppedafter a month or two i played it again it was fun, the game is pretty simple and its not too challenging if you dont choose to take risks but i think its a fun game.in the game you pretty much hire pirates level them up give the ones you like some skills so they wont die and improve your ship over and over with cannos and decorations. the game is enjoyable on its own but you wont find yourself playing hours and hours to no end.  I like the art style or more correctly like the coloring and dont hate the art style which is sadly a good thing for indie games and not a normal thing. i give the game a thumb up because it costed me near to nothing it was like a bonus to a bunch of great games and i played about 10 hours of this and every so often i play a little more and it is still fun and enjoiable to me.P.S. its improtant to get poop cleaning mastery from a misk shop cause its the only way to clean poop, teach about one pirate every five pirates (and one early on)			"

												Pixel Piracy is an Indie Pirate Simulator from the makers of Terraria. The game is a fun game to play when your bored. You create your own Captain and you create a crew by hiring people to help you on your journey. But be careful as you may come across enemy pirates wanting to steal your gold.The game also allows you to create your own Pirate Ship, which is always fun!Sadly, the game dosen't have as much content as I would of liked it too. You find yourself completely ignoring the objective given to you before you start your game. You just keep repeating the same stuff over and over again. But it dosen't stop it from being fun for the first few hours of the game.I do recommend you to get this game as it has a low price too. Fans of Terraria will probably not be disapointed! "

												A great game with a lot of promise and hours of fun, but has been abandoned by the devs and has practicaly no hope of any big bug fixes or new content. It is really unfortunate because this game is really fun and has a lot of potential if the right amount of work was put into it.Game 8/10Recomendation 1/10Pick it up on a really good sale if you like pirate games and rogue likes.

Early Access Review
								At the current state of this game I would never ecommend wasting money on this game. It was so fun to play back before the broken update hit. I could move all my men to kill the enemy and it was such a nice combat style....now onto this update. You have to assign people to teams which half the time don't listen. The ship you have is the one you are stuck with. Only thing you can really do is modify it now. The plunder interaction is completely broken, you hit it and in a single instant you see all your hard work and your crew just disappear. Then the game says the amazing promise of any early access game ""GAME OVER"".			"

												Pirates need to be potty trained.This game is quite fun, the graphics are a bit oversaturated for my taste but I loved it even when it was early access and had very few features, now that there's an end game I feel like I'm gonna be playing it a lot more.What it is: captaining a pirate crew, pillaging/looting other ships and islands and exploration. Nice concept and it's quirky and fun but like most rogue-like games the gameplay is rather reptitive so if you're not into these kinds of procedurally generated games you might not be into this. Remember to have your crew be far away from the edge of the ship you guys are getting onto, biggest reason behind deaths when I play is I attack before everyone is fully on the ship and they instantly get knocked out into the ocean for the sharks to devour.

												Hello, it is DraganSlayer69 here bringing you another crappy review on another terrible game. If you are looking for a good game, this could be your lovely match. The story is quick, simple, and down to the point. As soon as I spawned in, I had the weirdest, gayest moans ever. The people just scream common pirate chants and annoying shouts.Anyway, I thought it looked a lot like Terraria.Then, Terraria reminded me of Starbound, and after that Edge of Space, and then it reminded me of ... what was that game called? ... oh yeah Pixel Piracy. Oh, that is the game I am writing a review about.You basically have to kill 4 Legendary Pirate Captains and then ""Rule the Seven Seas""Yo Ho Ho and Shiver me big long Timber because Pixel Piracy is actually a good game.

								It's a very interesting game, you're a pirate in a world where you start out as a low-class and can either end up dead or a man with many crewmates who want all your money and food. The only part that I find a little of a downside is once you get to a certain enemy difficulty they have cannons which can destroy your ship in about 2 direct hits.			"

												So I have owned this game for a several yrs, I keep coming back hoping they have fixed the bugs but No, they instead ported a broken game to xbox lol before fixing it. I have never been able to complete a game or play longer then 5 hrs or so. I get a discent size ship and a crew of 4 to 6+ and the game starts to lag to the point its unplayable. many people i have talked to say this is the case for them to. some people get a crew bigger 15+ then it starts to lag. either way many people have been unable to actully beat the game. and most peple with many hrs in game are restarting the game once there first starts lagging. I will change my Review to positive once they fix the game, and make it playable to actully beat the game.			"

Due to the awful GUI new players are usually left with little to no info on how to even navigate the game and use their pirates. The combat in this game is very bland which makes you very bored quickly.4/10 - Could be fun at sometimes, but most times it's just overly complex and broring.			"

Jim if you take a dump on my ship one more time I will gut you openRemember when everyone had like, two coupons for this game?Me either.Pixel Piracy is a game where you take on the role of a pirate captain and his crew.It's also kinda trash.The game is pretty badly optimized and some design choices left a bad taste in my mouth. Like how opening the menu slows the music to a halt, or how the female crew members make male remarks, and are just a male voiceline set at a high pitch. Like, I could have this one crewmate of mine named Sallly Somethingorother, and she'll be talking about how she needs a woman.I'd be fine with that if the same thing wasn't being said by literally every other woman.I have serious questions about how repopulation works for these pirates now, if noone is interested in the men.The game is kinda fun I guess but only for a little while. Then you get dicked over because apparently you forgot there was a salary system in this game and a mutiny gets staged and all the while your ship is covered in crap.Overall I give it a skull and crossbones/[insert pirate reference followed by 'YarHarHar'] "

												I have repeatedly tried to get into this game.  I've had it since early access.  After all this time it still feels like it could be one of those ""New game every day"" flash games.  It's just boring.  You would think without complex graphics they could add a little variety but every encounter looks exactly the same.  There is also no strategy.  Just go to the next closest location and one click will move the entire crew from ship to shore (or other ship) where they kill everything without any guidance.  And the icing on the cake is that your entire crew can be killed by walking by a spikey bush!  Forget the enemies, that bush is a killer!			"

												Usually if a game is bad i just delete it and move on, however with this game i feel the need to warn people that it is yet another terrible pirate game.I return to try it out after various patches and it still has game breaking bugs. Also for a permadeath game you have almost no control what so ever of your characters, and for a game that is "" Randomly generated "" each time, it has little to no variation each time with the starting options for your next playthrough.

												Pixel Piracy is a pirate simulator game where you control a group of pirates doing what pirates do best, that is plundering and picking fights with people (and animal). You start out with a captain and you choose what type of adventure you're going and manage your crew and finance as you sail to the path of gold and glory. A fun pirate simulator, pirate battles is exciting especially in the bigger ones where you can fire cannons and knock enemies overboard and see them descent the blue abyss below.One of my issues with this game is that it doesn't offer intuitive mechanics. When I first bought this game, it has absolutely nothing that teach me how to do stuff. But now it has tutorials and an in-game help despite some features (like capturing animals and bring them on board) is still not explained. I'll give it a pass for now and give kudos to the devs for fixing the game and keeping it updated.The main problem for me was this game has an incorrectly implemented difficulty progression. No, I don't mean the actual difficulty level you start the game with, but the ""danger level"" of pirate encounters. So the game wants you to defeat 4 (four) Legendary Pirates (referred as LP from now on). Instead of maxing out the danger level of all LPs, what the devs should've done is to scale up the difficulty (i.e danger level) once you defeat an LP and keep scaling up until you face the final LP. When I was playing and I defeated my first LP, I felt like that I ""was too good at this"" and it ultimately leads to me feeling that the game drags on unnecessarily long. Once you defeat an LP, you have to literally travel across the entire map for the next closest LP and defeat him, which was no problem except that you will get dozens of pirate encounters that felt like more of a bother rather than a threat. Then I played in another difficulties to see if the gameplay will be different, but I still encounter that plateau where I'm virtually invincible once I'd be able to defeat LP. I don't even know if the difficulty levels changed anything except slightly buffed enemies, more encounter, and marked up shop item prices. I think this bit needs major rework. Finishing the game by defeating three other LP is more of a chore than a challenge.Final thoughts, give it a try if you will, but for me it was fun until it became an absolute bore.			"

												After the relaunch of Pixel Piracy (AKA Enhanced Edition), I decided to give a second chance. Glad I did. The game is so much better now it's almost another one (and pretty fun)! Now there's a real tutorial, better performance, essential gameplay changes and an intuitive UI. If you bought this game on Early Access days, I suggest you to take another look now.			"
