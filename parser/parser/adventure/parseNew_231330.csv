												Yes, after a looooong time I just thought that this game deserves a small recommendation / review!This game is one of my longest dreams that came through. A game where you can be a true adventurer as the famous Quatermain (or Indiana Jones if you want) and this in a Ego-Shooter. What the ♥♥♥♥; is that kinda cool? Really? Adventuring in a Ego-Shooter? YES, that is possible. The Farm 51 developing team has made a great game with that. You have brilliant graphic moments (Unreal Engine 3), but of course there are also some bad graphics in there. But hey, nevermind. The important part is that you have really AWESOME PUZZLE moments here. Some of 'em are tricky, lots of 'em are ""normal"" but funny. The dialogs between James Quatermain and Jennifer Goodwin (your female partner) are funny and make you feel you're just right here - within the awesome temples and pyramids. ;)So, if you love lots of puzzles, adventuring and of course Ego-Shooter then you have to try this game. :)Pros:» lots of puzzles (easy and hard / before you can choose the difficulty for puzzles)» awesome atrmosphere with pyramids, temples and other ""Egypt stuff""» nice graphics with the Unreal Engine 3 - the most time » funny dialogs» well-done mixture of adventuring and Ego-Shooter» long-driven story ( I played the whole game with adventuring moments 17 hours^^)Cons:» shooting moments are boring and not challenging» some graphics bugs» at the beginning the controls are a bit complicated » The multiplayer part is a waste of timeTell me what you think about this game if finished! :)			"

												Deadfall Adventures is a first person action/adventure game made by The Farm 51. In Deadfall you play as James Lee Quatermain, an adventurer who struggles to live up to his legendary adventurer of a grandfather, Allan Quatermain. Quatermain's new job is to escort a US agent called Jennifer Goodwin through an Egyptian temple to find an ancient treasure which will eventually lead you all across the world killing mummies and chasing Nazis.Deadfall is of course inspired by the likes of Indiana Jones and Uncharted and if you like those two things, or anything similar, chances are you're gonna have a good time playing this game. I'd also like to mention that at the time of writing my review I'm approximately halfway through the main campaign.+Great graphics with good visual effects+Great puzzles, they are challenging and often take a lot of thinking to solve but never feel too hard+Combat difficulty and puzzle difficulty can be changed independently +Interesting mix of genre+Overall mediocre gunplay apart from an interesting mechanic involving mummies and flashlights+Some cool locations+Lots of hidden collectibles to find+Relatively wide variety of weapons+Good variety of enemies to fight+Great atmosphere+Performs well on high settings even on my medium PC+Simple controls+/-All of the humour in the game is very cheesy, personally not my cup of tea but others may enjoy it-Bland voice acting-I noticed a fair few typos and occasionally missing words in the subtitles-Uninteresting story based around uninteresting characters-Riddled with bugs and glitches-Puzzle hints are almost entirely useless-Checkpoints are few and far between-Clunky animationsVerdict:7Despite some issues I had fun playing Deadfall with its good graphics, great puzzles and its interesting genre combination. If you're a fan of Indiana Jones style things then I suggest you pick this one up while it's on sale.***This review was written using a key provided by the Publisher for review purposes***El K.			"

												First, let's get one thing out of the way: this is not an Indiana Jones clone. Indiana Jones was himself based on and a tribute to Allan Quatermain (H.R. Haggard, 1885) and Professor George Edward Challenger (A.C. Doyle, 1912). And the protagonist of this game, James Lee Quatermain, Allan Quatermain's great-grandson, has a completely different personality (and a couple of jokes in the game point out those differences).But the feel, the mood and the ambiance are the same, so Indiana Jones fans WILL enjoy it.The good:When Lucas created Indiana Jones, he was trying to recreate the feel of 1930s action serials. This game succeeds in re-recapturing that feel and it's the main point in favor of this game. The scenery is beautiful and even the ceilings are worth admiring (not to mention that they also sometimes hold clues or things with which you can interact). The plot is unoriginal, but still engaging. The puzzles are logical and well integrated in the flow of the game. There's an interesting selection of weapons and they feel well balanced. You can kill an unarmored human enemy with one or two bullets, but they can return the favor, so you can't play this game as if you were Rambo. The journal, a very obvious copy of Henry Jones' journal, is not interesting to read, but it is very useful. Sometimes it just provides a hint for a puzzle. Other times, it's a key part of the puzzle and you can't solve it without consulting the journal. A nice touch is that the foreigners you meet speak in their native tongue, which makes it feel more authentic.The bad:The game is so linear that you might not notice a difference if they put it on rails. Backtracking is impossible because your entrance is invariably blocked every time you enter a new zone. I can't see this game having a lot of replayability. It uses the lazy, antiquated, and much hated checkpoint mechanism. Sometimes, the chekpoint is so far back that it can take 10 minutes to replay the part leading up to your death. Movement and shooting are ok, but in almost every other part of the interface, it feels so much like a console port that it's practically a slap in the face to PC users. You can only scroll back and forth between your weapons; you can't select the one you want directly. The POV is very strange and gives you the impression that you're only 4 feet tall. This feeling is exacerbated by the fact that you're unable to  jump on a crate that your grandmother could jump over. The jumping is so sluggish, in fact, that it's more irritating than useful. There are glitches that will let you get trapped between two objects and your only option is to restart from your last checkpoint. The acting is a bit on the campy side, but not so much that it ruins the game.But for all the little irritants, this is a fun little trip into an Indy-esque world and I still recommend it, though not at the ridiculously high full price.One odd thing: the optional Allan Quatermain revolver that comes with the Deluxe edition is worse than the default Webley; it's just prettier.Two suggestions: (1) don't swap your basic revolver for a better one you find. The basic revolver has infinite ammo, your new one does not! (2) If you're so inclined, you can change one of the ini files to give yourself infinite ammo for all weapons (instructions are on the web). A nice side-effect is that you end up keeping almost every weapon you find (you can usually carry only two), but you occasionally get stuck on one of them until some random event in the game clears the buggy state and you can switch weapons again. It's a fun way to run the game a second time.			"

												Man, this game is beautiful. Deadfall Adventures has the setting and story of Indiana Jones, the style of Uncharted and the gameplay of... a generic first person shooter. You play this game from a first person perspective which is actually a very nice twist on the genre. You'll be traveling to different parts of the world to find hidden treasures, solve puzzles and chase bad guys.Like I said, the game has the vibe of Indiana Jones. It all looks very colorful and very adventurous. It has awesome, detailed graphics and horrible, horrible voice acting. A damn shame, because the rest of the game is actually worthwhile, but the voice acting is one of the things that drags the game down. The other thing that drags the game down are the firefights. It's inaccurate and doesn't feel realistic. It's important, because near the end you'll be fighting off more and more enemies.The story is fun in that it doesn't take itself all that seriously. It will be fun as long as you keep that in mind.There are also loads of treasures to be found; some can be found in the open, some are hidden and can be found by simply exploring and some can be collected by solving puzzles. These puzzles are usually simple to solve and can be completed in just a few minutes. If some of these puzzles were only a bit harder it would've given you a better feeling of accomplishment.Doesn't take away the fact that it's fun to try and find these treasures. Treasures can also be used to upgrade your character, but I didn't notice much of a difference when I first started the game and when I eventually finished the game. He still felt like the exact same guy to me.Checkpoints are sometimes awkwardly placed so if you die while trying to solve a second or third puzzle you might have to start all over from the beginning. This can be frustrating but usually it's just a couple of minutes. Still... annoying.Deadfall Adventures wants to be a first person Uncharted and in a way The Farm 51 has succeeded in doing this. Next time, keep the graphics, improve the voice acting and shooting aspects, make the puzzles (a bit) harder and you'll probably have a great, fun sequel in your hands.[Rating: 79/100]			"

Fair idea, mediocre executionAs a game, DA is a fair one.  It's probably not going to be one of the titles that you will remember with nostalgy 10, 20 or 30 years from now, but it's not horrible either.In terms of game concept, the main shortfall is its lack of originality: there's not a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other titles, not in terms of mechanics nor progression, or characters.  The fact that the game is inspired by the H. Rider Haggard novels (the same that inspired Lucas/Spielberg for Indiana Jones) makes the game feel like a knock-off of the glorious franchise from the '80s.  There's the fedora, the rolling rock ball chasing you, the ride on the mine cart, the female sidekick, etc...At this point I would have still given it a ""thumbs up"" though: afterl all, not every single game must be ground-breaking and innovative.  However the execution is also unimpressive:I played it on ""hard"" (the max level available) on both combats and puzzles, but neither were much of a challenge (and I'm just an ""average Joe"" kind of player).A couple of times I walked behind a rock/tree/wall only to remain trapped behind it, or having my character bouncing up and down and not moving anywhere.Sometimes clicking items in an order that did not reflect the programmers expectations (e.g. during the briefing at the agency) simply made impossible to make any progress, obliging me to reload the last saved checkpoint.Body animation is rigid and definitively sub-par relative to mainstream titles.I should also mention that I played DA on a linux box (64bit, brand new nVidia card with proprietary drivers, CPU 8 cores, 16Gb RAM) and the port is of beta quality at best.  In particular there is some issue with shader compilation, so that even on my machine (which is quite top-end, hardware-wise), just to boot the game requires ~3 minutes.In-game transitions between different segments of a map are affected by the same problem, although at a much smaller scale (5-10 seconds of waiting).  This is acceptable while roaming on foot in the map, but it totally breakes the experience in fast-paced transitions like those in the mine cart run (basically you are left with a fixed screenshot and the music background, and when animation resumes you are much further down the railtrack than when you last were playing.Again: the game is not horrible.  It's ""ok"", but the world is a big place, and I would rather recommend something else to a friend. "

												Personally, I enjoyed the experience that was Deadfall Adventures, because this game is meant for people who are fans of the Adventure/Fantasy genre, but with archaeologists.Sadly this means not everyone might enjoy this, as this follows the usual ""Get to the artifact before the badguys get to it and use it for world domination"" cliche. Also, since the game is focused in the first person, some gamers might expect alot of good action in a first person perspective environment, but I will say that the shooting bits of the game are pretty generic, along with the usual cliche armies of Nazis and Russians (yes the two most cliche kinds of badguys in shooters are in the same game together.)In my opinion, I did not mind the cliches as they were exactly what I wanted and expected from the game, because the game does take place in the eyes of an archaeologist, and I always like adventures involving such a profession. This game does it's best to recreate the kind of Indiana Jones like adventure we expect in a game involving archaeologists, so I understand why the shooting sections seems generic, because the game wants to focus more on the actual adventure and not just drown it in FPS heaven... which can be a bad thing if overdone.I heard a bunch of people complained about some of the puzzles in the game, saying it was either too confusing, too straight forward, or the hints of the ingame journal seem too vague. I played through the game myself and only once did I have to look up a walkthrough for a puzzle, turns out that certain puzzle I was stuck on was super simple as all I had to do was shoot a lever. Some puzzles in the game did seem confusing at first to me, but after some thought and looking around I did actually figure out what to do, and the journal only seemed very vague to me just once in the game, which was at that one super simple puzzle I mentioned. There was indeed some simple straight forward puzzles, but I felt these puzzles were a simple relief to the bigger and more complex puzzles I encountered previously. Overall, I felt the puzzles were fun and it felt good just to finally solve each one.My only complaint in the game is character animations in the cutscenes. Characters move awkwardly in cutscenes, which reminded me of how bad the character animations in the game Dead Island were in cutscenes when I used to play that.Other than that, I pretty much enjoyed myself with the rest of the game.My favourite part of Deadfall Adventures was the very cool and well done minecart chase scenes were done in the Mine level of the game. That part of the game made me feel very nostalgic as this seemed to be a clear reference to the minecart chase scene in the film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.Sadly I could not try out the multiplayer portion of the game, since nobody was hosting anything. So I shall skip this part of the review since I was late for the party.Overall, I enjoyed this game. I really liked the adventure it let me experience, as I also had alot of fun with the characters, even if our archaeologist hero seemed awkwardly animated in cutscenes along with everyone else. I got through alot of fun puzzles and moments in the game, just feeling the nostalgia of older adventures touching my heart with each step.Now, I recommend this game to people and fans who enjoy adventures starring archaeologists, travelling, exploring temples, avoiding traps, solving ancient puzzles, and recovering mythical and genuine artifacts for fortune and glory. This game is not as bad as Metacritic says on the store page, as I feel it deserves more, because the game is based for a certain kind of audience who would enjoy this, no matter how cliche the things in this game sound. I missed playing a good adventure starring an archaeologist in the 20th century, and that is exactly what I got to play once again with Deadfall Adventures.Thank you Farm 51 for giving me another adventure to play. I hope the next adventure you guys make will be a successor to Deadfall Adventures, because you guys deserve more than that cruddy 53 out of 100 Metacritic gave you for it.			"

												I don't know why this game has been so over looked. It's not particularly innovative, however if you were born in the era when Indianna Jones was still cool, this game will give you a bad case of nostalgia. The single player is great but I haven't been able to play the multiplayer for this so far, the servers are unfortunately empty. I recommend you try it, it's pure Indianna Jones, you'll feel like in the movies.			"

Deadfall Adventure Totally enjoyed this game ever so much. It reminds me of Indiana Jones, only with out the whips. I tried MP but its dead, and I dont believe this game even needs a MP, but Co-op side by side with a friend or family member, tracking through the adventure together would be stacks fun. I did not collect every relic nor did I get all achievements ( they will be tough anyway as they require MP to obtain), but rather I just enjoyed my time with this fun FPS and its a very nice Adventure. All I ask from these developers is I WANT MORE !   I want to see  Deadfalls 2 "

												Super cheesy but actually pretty solid Indiana Jones style adventure that doesn't take itself seriously at all but yet still provides a solid adventure regardless.The story itself is decent and the dialogue is intentionally cheeseball and pokes fun at itself often. The gunplay is solid. The backdrops are gorgeous. This is a very nice looking game. The puzzles were mostly easy, but there were a couple challenging ones mixed in.If you are looking for a game similar to Indian Jones movies, or in the same style of a Tomb Raider or Uncharted (but without the production values), but with more humor, this is a game you should definitely try out.Far more enjoyable than you would think just by looking at the product page. Well worth the 10 or 12 hours it takes to finish.7.5 out of 10			"

												Deadfall Adventures is not without its flaws but overall it is a solid and enjoyable game with some nice locations and tricky puzzles. There is nothing here that hasn't already been done before but it blends all the elements together for an action packed experience that isn't afraid to tax your grey matter either. Hopefully this isn't the last time we join the adventures of James Lee Quatermain. For a full review check out http://www.gameramble.com/deadfall-adventures-pc-game-review.html "

												Pros: - Fun Indian Jones type adventure- Super cheesy dialog = Funny - Inexpensive (5 euros) - Decent graphics- Runs on LinuxCons: - Glitchy (example, I often see a reflection of myslef on the ground which makes it impossible to see where I'm stepping)- Multiplayer is dead - No one is playing this game- Hasn't been updated in ages and the Linux version is still in Beta (with no hope of a final release)- The puzzles were not well thought out - they are either too easy or the solution is not clear at all (and you just somehow manage to solve them). Overall: If you can pick this up on a bargain sale, it's worth it for the single player. Just don't expect any support from the developer as this game has already passed it's development phase.EDIT: After getting almost to the end, the game stopped launching entirely.  As there will be no more updates for this, I would recommend stayng clear of it.			"

												Do not adjust your bullwhip. The Indiana Jones vibe you’re getting from Deadfall Adventures is no mistake. The fur felt fedora, the hero-swagger comebacks, the Harrison Ford good looks; these all serve as the template for James Quatermain, the star of first-person shooter and puzzle-platformer, Darkfall Adventures.James Quatermain is an apparent gambler and all-around cynic. His famous great-grandfather’s notebook lands in his hands one day, and off James Quatermain goes on a trap-laden, puzzle-heavy, supernatural adventure spanning three continents, two adversarial nations, and a priceless treasure known as the Heart of Atlantis. Accompanying James Quatermain is a smart-ish, red-headed, hazel-eyed siren that is sometimes attracted and sometimes repelled by James Quatermain’s off-the-cuff advances. And, as expected, he was saving the girl so often that I sometimes forgot I was supposed to be going after a national treasure.With his trusty double six-shooters holstered on his hip, James Quatermain peels caps on all manner of 1930’s threats. He’ll gun down entire platoons of Nazis and Russians, not to mention stacks of undead temple guardians. He’ll shoot people in Egypt, he’ll shoot people in Antarctica, and he’ll shoot people in Central America. There’s nothing and no one he won’t shoot, including long-distance puzzle buttons that flip around with a well-placed bullet. He’ll shoot at flame-throwing traps, he’ll shoot at spear-throwing traps, and he’ll shoot at oversized pottery hiding either treasure or little bugs -- and then he’ll shoot the little bugs. I’m being tongue-in-cheek, obviously, since guns get the job done in most video games today, but it strangely becomes more apparent in a puzzle-shooting game where you won’t be shooting all the time, just most of the time.Along with a cadre of period-specific weapons like tommy guns and TNT, James Quatermain packs a highly volatile flashlight. It’s apparently really bright and the undead don’t like it when it’s really bright. In fact, the flashlight appears to be copy-pasted from video game thriller, Alan Wake. As in Alan Wake, James Quatermain hits the high-intensity button which drains the battery and burns the undead, making them vulnerable to bullets.Also in his adventure pack is a compass that’s terrible at pointing toward magnetic north, but excellent at pointing out nearby treasures - a convention that feels lifted from Far Cry 2, in which the protagonist uses a GPS that starts flashing a little green light whenever conflict diamonds are within a certain radius. In Deadfall Adventures, however, you use treasures to cash in on a dull set of upgradeable skills and abilities. Collect enough treasure and you can run faster, shoot faster, reload faster, and do more damage with your flashlight.Good old flashlight. There’s even a span of about five minutes in Deadfall Adventures where James Quatermain is stripped of his weapons and left with nothing but his flashlight. He solves a few light-based puzzles with it, but then the game developers obviously got nervous and gave James Quatermain his guns back so he could get back to the business of shooting things again.. It was a brave five minutes without them, though.Throughout, James Quatermain is immersed in brutalist Egyptian, Mayan, and - mild spoiler - Atlantean architecture. The pyramids and mastabas and ziggurats are all sandy and stony and pillar lined, with rotating statues and sliding doors and monster-sized elevators, operated by all manner of pulleys and levers and button presses.It’d be impressive if they’d taken more time carving out environmental storytelling, but there’s virtually none of that to be found in Deadfall Adventures. The wall murals don’t reveal any stories, the sarcophaguses don’t talk about their inhabitants, and the treasures don’t have anything to say about the artists’ culture. Deadfall Adventures is sometimes pretty, but keeps itself firmly rooted in hallway gun battles and discrete arena target practice. The stones’ geometry and the buildings’ architecture have no other job than to register a few sprites’ worth of bullet damage.Some of the monolithic halls are embarrassingly rich with statues and carvings but, again, they do little more than provide a requisite level of atmosphere. You’re encouraged to explore every nook and cranny, but that only provides the occasional treasure to buff your stats. Exploration isn’t worth it for exploration’s sake: this unexplored hall might have an alligator pit while this one has a spear pit, but that’s it for story.Slow to realize its potential, Deadfall Adventures hits its stride somewhere in the third and final act. There they introduce notes from conquistadors that are read aloud, operating similar to audio logs you’d find in the BioShock games.The conquistador writers, however, have little to write home about.The puzzles, similarly, get quicker and more clever in the latter half. No real stumpers. Nothing to kill forward momentum for too long. Plus James Quatermain’s great-grandfather’s notebook has been there the whole time with varying degrees of clues on each continent; the difficulty level you choose in the beginning determines how obvious and spelled-out the hints are as you flip through the notebook.Mayan Jungle stages suddenly ramp up what the game could’ve been. Ms. Redhead grows more responsive to the environment and talks more relevantly about what she and Quatermain run across. Environments become more cinematic, with spooky voices calling from out of the temples, Doom-like snarls calling out from around dark corners, and ruins shake in their foundations. Mind the framerate slowdown, though, as too many dust particles in the air can drop things into semi slow motion.This is also one of those games where you can almost enjoy watching your enemies and allies bumble around the stage for a minute. Everyone usually knows to take cover but they’ll also sometimes start firing into the wall or pillar they’re standing behind. Your allies’ poor firefight skills are matched only by their invulnerability, so there’s never any danger of losing one of the good guys, and likewise very little danger of them taking down any bad guys. Just watch out for grenades. Lots and lots of grenades. It’s like the Nazis and Ruskies get their paycheck docked for every grenade they’re still holding onto at the end of a battle.There’s wonderful location-specific hit boxes all over people. Whatever early 20th century weapon you pick up, rest assured that it feels great to drive those bullets home, seeing enemies twist and shout from shoulder, arm, leg, and torso hits. Plus, there’s a meaty crack when you plant a headshot, which is sonically gratuitous, but nice.James Quatermain is quite the bullet sponge himself. Beautifully, there’s no heads-up display to speak of, and damage is well-communicated through red splatter on the screen and fading vision. Just take cover for a few seconds and you’re fine.Plenty of traps are instant death, though. One wrong step and James Quatermain will be groaning, dying, and lying on the ground, a You’re Dead gong chiming as the screen goes black. If, as the game tells you to do, you’re taking time to thoroughly explore the bluntly designed levels before you die, you’ll lose a reasonable amount of time and ground covered. Checkpoints are sometimes amateurishly placed too far apart.Deadfall Adventures is a middle-of-the-road Lost World adventure, where our wisecracking Indiana Jones-like hero spends more time saving and re-saving the girl than recovering a purportedly priceless and powerful treasure that ultimately doesn’t come off as all that pricey or powerful in the end. Oh, and I forgot to mention the final boss primarily because he got stuck on some rocks while I shot him repeatedly until he died. The end.			"

												I hate to give bad reviews but I had a really hard time finding the good in this game. From poor character development, the occasional illogical or stupidly easy puzzle, primitive first person shooter experience, and cheap rpg aspect, I had a lot of trouble getting as far in the game as I did. I will say that there is a layer of nostalgia as the storyline and environment liken to Indiana Jones movies a bit, but if you want to watch an adventure film do just that and bypass this game. My points in more depth: - Poor character development: Jumping right into the story the characteres prod with one another endlessly with mundane and all to frequent jest. The dialog and voice quality is lacking any intelligent use of pause, and becomes annoyingly predictable. - Puzzles are not very enjoyable after the initial nuance, in that the basic principle to shoot the block, or match the faces with the cheat sheet (in game little ""Perk"") is overused. Other puzzles were somewhat unique but either lacked a logical or discernably logical hint, like the rotate floating particles to make a shape puzzles. One such puzzle was eventually solved through trial and error, and didn't end up making a recognizable image. That was frusterating.- The first person shooter aspect is usually what draws me into a game. The satisfying plink of the well placed stealth head shot kill. Sadly this game's fps setup is a strict point and shoot. It reminds me in a way of hyperstudio from years ago where you defind a region, and if you ""crouched"" the region go slightly larger. Click anywhere in the region and you hit the target in (to make things easy) a random location selected from a finite and small preset. Oh yes, and the shotgun is just stupid - small amounts of ammo, no effective spread, and incredibly weak power. Besides headshots what's not more fun than rounding the corner and point blank blasting the baddie with a shotgun? Well, in the game your out of luck because even at point blank range it'll take three or four shells. Sure, we're talking older weapons, and sure, the enemy might have body armor. But at close range in the kevlar you're going to be at least knocked back.- Lastly, the rpg aspect of this game was pretty bland. A simple grid of powerups that are all vanilla. Shoot or reload faster - upgrade health pool, longer more powerful flashlight. Sure these are great and all if those are the starting base talents for a more complex tree. Sadly this is it for the game, for the trouble of running around and looking int every possible hidden corner in the game you get to aim a little better, and upgrade the once ""interesting"" combat mechanic (flashlight to weaken and kill zombies). In my opinion a good/fun rpg is one with talents that change how you play the game, and do so with very unique means. Take the classic fantasy class differences between melee, stealth, and magic combat structures.In short, I think the designers of this game tried to do a little too much in incorporating too many game archetypes into one. Sure, it's possible to create a great game in this way, but sadly this one stretched itself too far in too many directions, and its playability or ""fun factor"" if you will, suffered for it.			"

												It's okay with a hefty sale.The graphics are pretty decent in the game, almost every thing else is pretty cheesy and mediocre. Though for 5 bucks it's entertaining enough to make it worth your money. When playing the game you see the potential it has, but it has been brought down by under par voice acting and dialogs with weird pauses during conversations and a very cliché story.  There are also a few bugs in the game such as accidently pressing a wrong key (T) where your character becomes frozen and unable to move, you have to reload a checkpoint to fix it. You can also find maps in the levels, but no key to bring up the maps and look at them.And in general the gameplay and game mechanics is really not what you expect when you look at the nice graphics. It is just so under par compared to the graphics and the pretty detailed texturing. Shooting in this game is plain bad, your accuracy (unscoped) has little to do with hitting the AI target or not, it's unpricize by design. The AI is pretty bad too. instead of you going in to cover and shotting at the AI tactically from a dfistance you can just go beserk and run up to them and shoot them in the face from 1 meter away. And there are dozens more thing I could sum up that is either completely missing ((mini)map for example), or lacking and under par. The game is a lot like Uncharted, but then clearly made with a much lower budget and a worse story.Verdict: 68/100			"

												Deadfall Adventures is not a perfect game. It's a little childish and a little too easy (on normal difficulty), but it has nice, cozy, feel good, sunshine levels and joyful puzzles. I enjoyed playing the game a lot.The English voice acting is atrocious but the German voice acting is OK.Unfortunately multi-player is dead.If on sale, I totally recommend this game for a couple of relaxing hours. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. "

												Played it all the way through. A nice little Diversion. Nothing ground breaking in gameplay or story but still very entertaining.  I have to say that the puzzles fit in well and the environments are often very beautiful and well done. Definately worth a play through, although there won't be much here to bring you back once you've beat it. Looks like another case of crammed-in multiplayer that no one asked for forcing the single player experience to be shorter.			"

												For a 27 yr old PC gamer blasting away demons since DOOM, I have to say Deadfall is an amazingly fun game. Honestly, why hasnt anyone else though to do an ancient tomb crawling game based on and set in human history? Its excellent, and a very original idea for a game.. Honestly, it is one of the most beautiful games I have played through. The visual concepts and designs are just stunning. Gun play is, well... basic but excellent smooth gunplay. Fighting mechanics work how they are meant to, even if they arent anything extraoridnary. I would recommend this to anyone who finds themselves between big title games. The sloryline is pretty plain, but is still really easy to get sucked into, and play for 5 hrs straight. Somehow, it brought out the little kid in me... which is never a bad thing! Personal rating - 8.24999.			"

												I cannot recommend this game at the full $40 price point, however that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not worth trying out at a discount.  The levels are large, gorgeous, and fun to explore and I enjoyed teasing out the solutions to the various puzzles.  However, the game was prone to breaking in frustrating ways, some of which could not be solved by loading a checkpoint; this occasionally rendered treasure collection impossible.  Moreover, the update made substantial changes to the first couple of levels, and that is poorly documented in-game, or indeed anywhere but the Steam forums themselves.   The story, characters, and voice acting are middling at best, but if you can get past that it can be a fun shooter with an action-adventure flair that is sadly in short supply.  Adjust your expectations accordingly and wait for a good deal before you try it out, though.			"

												In my honest opinion I think that Deadfall Adventures had everything it needed to be a success but it turned into a disaster. You can describe it as a First Person Shooter Indiana Jones or Uncharted. The game doesn't look that bad and the gameplay is somewhat decent but the more I played it the more I despised it. No matter what gun you use they all feel the same, there's barely any recoil on the guys and they're fairly standard, usual World War 2 weaponry, you can either fire from the hip or aim down sights and that's probably one of the things I less enjoy on a First Person Shooter. Not only to mention it has regenerating health which is something I really hate in games nowadays because you can just go hide behind cover and wait for you to recover full health. The game is extremely linear but it does reward exploration by finding treasure which you can then spend upgrading your health, health regeneration, decreasing weapon spread and recoil etc. The game has some interesting design choices to it such as the use of the compass to find hidden treasure and the ocasional treasure maps you come across on each level, ocasionally you'll come across some puzzle sections in temples that do provide a varied and different experience from the rest of the game and the only help you have to beat them is your notebook, this was probably for me the only strong point of the game. Story wise it's kinda okay, the voice acting is pretty much terrible but it ocasionaly has some humour on the writing. There's also no save feature, only checkpoints which might upset some people, such as me. Overall, considering it's price I don't think Deadfall Adventures is a game you should be looking foward to, it's also worth mentioning it costs 40€ for europeans while it also costs $40 for people from North America which it's a considerable price difference. I'd recommend avoiding it, if you're eager to try it out you might want to wait for a heavy discount.			"

Posted: June 10, 2016
												Deadfall Adventures could be summed up in short: Indiana Jones' adventures B movie version presented in an *extremely* glitchy game with slapped on ""RPG elements"" (because it's a nice tag to sell with)  , in which the storywriters and designers probably never speak with eachother. The B movie feeling in the game's aspect means cliché story, bad storywriting, and pretty much awkward characters.TLDR/Summary: The game is inferior to shooters, to adventure games, but still, if it runs with an acceptible framerate on your computer, it's an okay game. And despite of all the lack of polish, the bugs and glitches, no gamebreaking ones. A well-playeable game, but I pick not recommended because I'm not willing to rate positively something that's so bug-ridden as this game. Neither the game, nor the developers deserve more than ~ 5$ for it.In the game you play with Allan James Quartermain, who got hired to protect and  help the young archeologist Jennifer Goodwin, who's name I can't remember because it was told only like two times and basically has NO part of the story so I had to google it. The classic male-female dynamic of these adventure stories just doesn't work here - you are the one doing the shooting, and as the player, you're the one doing the puzzles. She's having the average NPC AI, which is really bad in the game. She's always behind cover, sometimes 3 rooms behind you, without helping, or tries to help but after she hides behind a cover, she doesn't leave it until enemies are killed - once she didn't even move after the enemy ran behind her. Her part of the story is limited to shout ""I need a little help here"" while she shoots anyone, regardless of you're fighting 4 mummies while she's shooting from safety, no enemy close, and ""Are you hurt Quartermain?"" after 80% of the fights, and acting as a stuck dictaphone during puzzles, repeating the same vague hint every 20-30 second. At the end of the game I felt like I have four enemies: nazis, soviets, mummies and my own useless companion.The protection and treasure hunting takes part in Egypt, then in Antarctica, then the mayan jungle. The environment looks pretty nice, though I think the game has optimalization problem - my computer is not really strong, but I'm not sure if 8 fps with AAx2 is normal, while AAx12 causes almost the same fps. Without anti-aliasing I got ~30 fps in the same section - the game is really heavy on lighting effects, this seems to be a reasonable explanation for the resource-heaviness of the game as it's basically a tunnel-game with a few (short) crossroads every now and then. Speaking about it - game is full with invisible walls, really hard to decide where you can jump on a rock and where you can't until trying - I had the usual AAA handholding that doesn't take any risks of you getting lost, so you mostly play in a corridor.Gameplay: RPG elements are just a selling point, it makes neither sense, nor it's useful. Collect artifacts (good) to upgrade hp/stamina, flashlight damage/recharge, accuracy/reload/recoil/spread and then another level of these. All passive with no noticable effects, none of them is unlockable or changes the gameplay. The gunplay is... okayish, nothing special. Standard past-WW1 weaponry, though one question remains here. Sometimes he nazi has thompson machine guns(american model), another times soviets have Kar98K rifle (german model). Besides of the few hiccups like this, there is no real problem with them. Aiming down the sights and firing in bursts works out greatly, I could easily take down enemies barely visible with machine guns after some careful aiming. The puzzles are intresting, to say. Most of them is easy to solve, others I'm still not sure how did I solve as even the ingame hint/guide system provided no useful information. Speaking of which, game does a mixed job with said hints. It starts out as a diary or Quartermain's ancestor, with sketches about puzzles he found. I really support the idea, as I'm all-out for anything that's immersive to the game's system, and not just a help menu. On the other hand, this soon becomes THE hint menu, as it's getting absurd that puzzle after puzzle which wasn't seen by people since thousands of years you magically still have sketches about the next puzzle. The idea was great, some refinement would be good for it.And now about the stuff that really makes me not recommend this game: It has so many good ideas, yet it feels like a lazy work, without much effort and attention put into it.The game often makes no sense, the most obnoxious is being a part when a follower of yours staying behind, saying he can't follow you though a jump, he'll look for a rope. After you got part of the relic and get back to him, it's clearly shown in the cinematics that Quartermain has way, way   more rope on his shoulder[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com] than needed - I can't understand how they could pay so little attention to the development of their own game.Mummy/zombie enemies... I'm almost sure that their animation got re-used from another game. Sword-wielding enemies stab twice, then start JUMPING around while stabbing - quite impressive from the zombies who are slowly walking, and doesn't even fit the fighting style of conquistadors.  + in the mayan jungles conquistador zombies use muskets, that can magically shoot 2-3 times without reloading.And the bugs. Oh, the bugs and glitches. Game started with Jen starting to shoot at enemies by shoving her hand into a boulder and shooting it's insides, while the arab ambusher missed his cover, and hid behind a non-existant coverage in the open (Enemies repeatedly hide at sides of the covers instead of behind them). After the fight and looking around, Jen stuck in a loop of running in place in the middle of nothing, only to later give me the key for a gate while 2-3 of her fingers clipping through the item.Later on it became clear that the UI is extremely buggy - your weapons and hands works individually. Once I stuck with hands not moving, while camera+compass bobbing up and down like running. Another time my left hand vanished. Right pistol animation stopped from happening.  I EVEN GOT MY HANDS DETACHED AT ONE POINT.[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com] "

												This game has some potential to be an amazing game.It hasn't been done perfectly so like me you will probally have to ignore some stuff to enjoy the game.Felt like the movement wasn't smooth specially when you are running, perhaps also some fps drops.But as I said you look past that lil wierdness and then you enjoy the game.Well I really did have fun playing this game, it's not that hard and solving the puzzles ingame isn't that hard either but it's fun. I had 12 hours gametime so I was happy with that.You are a treasure hunter and you must find several pieces to, because it's what you get paid for do your job.I don't wanna spoil the storyline so thats all the info im giving you.The only downsdide of this game is the Multiplayer, nobody is ofcourse playing it and if you manage to get a group to gether and play it online it's kinda laggy, not fun as you will never 100% this game!Like I said the game is fun, look past it's flaws, enjoy the storyline and have some relaxing fun.

												This is by far one of the worst Linux game ports ever! The game has a nasty aim bug, apparently you can fix it when you disable mouse smoothing, but that doesn't seem to work for me, so aiming in the game is sluggish and a pain in the butt. Not to mention the occasional hang ups. Nordic games has really messed up the Linux port big time and maybe they should consult Feral Interactive or Aspyr on how to properly port their games over to Linux. Nevertheless, the game performance is good and it runs fairly smooth until you actually have to aim and shoot, that's where it goes down hill. Too bad, this game had potential, but it's definitely not worth 49,99 bugs. If you can get it for 10 or 15 bugs that's acceptable!			"

												Chasing Nazis and hunting for treasures in the 1930s/1940s - sounds like Indiana Jones. And that is pretty much what this is, except that your hero is called James Lee Quatermain - MISTER Quatermain - and that this is an FPS instead of an Adventure. It's a good game overall, while also being a bit buggy at times. Falling through the floor and out of the map, getting stuck while walking for no apparent reason or options not saving like the unlocked framerate, things like that. The voice acting is embarrasing to listen to (at least in German, don't know if it's better in English) and the cutscenes look low budget. But overall I'm enjoying this game (haven't finished it yet). The gunplay is solid, the graphics are quite nice and the story is cheesy, but not bad at all. I also like the mechanic of using a compass to find treasures, although it doesn't make much sense if you think about it. What compass would point towards ancient treasures? But hey, it's a video game, so who cares.			"

Deafall Adventures: Flawed but goodIf you want to know weather or not you're going to enjoy Deadfall Adventures, you have to ask yourself one question:""Can I look past the absolute worst dialogue in the history of modern video games?""That is the key part where Deadfall... falls dead. The story is nothing special but it's interesting enough. The action is good, the music is well-done, and the puzzles are challenging. There is a lot to like here.Unfortunately Deadfall Adventures has numerous setbacks. The biggest one being the abysmal dialogue. The writing is average, but the voice acting is awful. Characters are loud when they should be quiet, and quiet when they should be loud. There are odd pauses throughout conversations, and some of the voice lines are just downright delayed beyond belief.The other big issue is the widescreen support (or lack thereof), and the FOV. While I praise Deadfall Adventure's FOV slider for offering the player an unusually large variation (up to 140), the weapon view models are unaffected by this FOV. Thus, although you can set the FOV to a high number, you cannot remove the visual sensation that your character is holding his gun right in front of his eyeball.However, with some tweaking this can be fixed. An excellent (and free) program called Flawless Widescreen will allow you to tweak the weapon FOV to be more acceptable.Fortunately, this fix is a trivial one. And once you have completed it, you should have no trouble enjoying the game's unique blend of shooting and puzzle-solving.My only other problem with Deadfall Adventures was its difficulty. And I don't mean the game was too hard. Rather, I think it was far too easy. In my first playthrough, I set both the puzzle and combat difficulty to their highest (Hard), and had little trouble with it. Bare in mind that I also restricted myself from using any of the upgrades throughout the game, in order to try and increase the game's challenge. I think the difficulty on the puzzles was a good balance, but the combat was far too forgiving.The culprit behind the easy combat is likely the game's rather stupid AI. The enemies will often walk slowly towards the player with no regard for their safety. Or sometimes they'll pop up from behind cover, aim at the player, and take several seconds before they actually pull the trigger. This gives the player plenty of opportunities to eliminate them.However, do not let these faults detract from the game too much. In spite of the above, there is much to like in Deadfall Adventures. I found the puzzles (for the most part) to be challenging and just frustrating enough to keep me going. The weapons were also surprisingly satisfying. Couple that with an interesting story, and a chance to play what is essentially the Indiana Jones FPS we never got, and Deadfall Adventures is a fun, albeit flawed, gaming experience.			"

												+ Good graphic+ Dialogue covers lots of jokes+ Able to choose the difficulty of puzzles- Lack of expression on characters' face. I consider it shouldn't happen in a 40-bucks game released in 2013- No auto-save after Collecting treasures. Some treasures are really far away from the main route, and some hide in dangerous place... Sometimes if you made a mistake, it means you need to waste time to collect those treasures again...- Some puzzles are quite boring, and when you need to solve 2-3 boring puzzle continuously, it really break the gameplay.  Oh! And I hate the grandfather's note! Some puzzles don't provide any tip for you, and all you could do was to try every possibility, which is quite boring. Guess it's time to look for tips in the note? It should provide tips about puzzles for players, right? But, it does more than that... it's a puzzle guide provides complete puzzle solution... Well, I prefer hard puzzle with a few tips, which is fun to solve, but not meaningless puzzle with solution on your hand...(*The story is very simple but exciting, however, the music doesn't make me feel that way. This may be due to my personal taste so I don't put this in cons =0=)Overall, the game is ambitious, but not good enough for the full price. If you are a big fan of Indiana Jones, you may try this game, but don't expect too much from it.			"

												Very under-rated game, it's nice to see this game get some better review ratings as of late.In short, if you like Egyptian lore or dug The Mummy movies with Brandon Fraser then you should definitely check this out.The first reviews stated that the game had some bugs and glitches but I havent ran into any so I'm guessing they've been fixed at this point.The controls are smooth, the combat is just okay. The character models are crap but environmwnts and their layouts make up for all this!It's kinda like a first person Uncharted or Tomb Raider in a way. It's not open world but the levels are huge and very open for you to explore.The writing is great although the voice acting can be underwhelming. Still, this is very fun despite the cons. It's a must have for people who are fascinated with Egyptian lore and things like Pyramids with changing rooms and puzzles.			"

												Good game overall.Pretty graphics, very high quality models and most likely textures, nice environment, nice story.The game is nice, though a little buggy with the guns, some shots don't register in single player mode when shooting through a wire fence (or maybe it's intended.. Weird though). Haven't tested MP yet. This happens rarely, so it's not that much of a bother. The only things that actually bothered me.. For single player; is that the AI is dumb; and character's animations sort of off. It would have been great with a lil more refining on the animations and character surface constraints, things like that. The animation is always the same when they walk, even on tipping surfaces. Voice acting could have been much better too; the rest of the audio work is really good. Other than that, I like the game. Optimisation is good, I run it perfectly with all settings on maximum.Art style is great too.			"

												Mediocre, feels like a lowbudget title wrapped in AAA♥♥♥♥♥♥ could have been much more but the terrible voiceover, clumsy and dull shooting, multitude of cliches and generic characters, boring puzzles makes it forgettable as soon as you finish it. The locations and the theme of the game are the only real positive things.			"

												If you're into single player adventure games this is for you. If you're into Co-op campaign games, look elsewhere. This only has survival co-op and a very bad one at that. It takes a whole clip to kill one enemy, and this was on easy mode lol. I bought this for the co-op, but there is nothing listed about the co-op aspect of the game on the store page. If only I would have waited or done some more research, I feel like a noob. If I didn't pick this game up for real cheap, I would be very upset at myself lol. Instead of adding a ""funny"" button to reviews, they should of added a ""Maybe"" to the recommend buttons. 40 dollar pricetag? No way.			"

 Deadfall Adventures  It is simply the average game which has a quite nice graphics and that's it. Do not expect any amazing story from this production. We fly to different places on the world as James Lee Quatermain to look for artifacts and stop the evil Nazis and the Russians. AI is at a low level and the finishing game on the highest difficulty level is not a problem. Nice graphics and variety of locations, cool soundtrack and nice shooting system are the advantages of this production. The game have also the multiplayer that is empty and as I join a server I had enormous lags. But if you like to play games that are not so good and you love to give them a chance, you can definitely try it. "

												So, in 1938 Allan Quatermain's great grandson teams up with a snooty English archeologist who wishes she was Lara Croft and together they bumble around in some old ruins fighting nazis, communist Russians, Arab mercenaries and a whole bunch of zombie-mummy-type things.If I'm being entirely honest then I'd have to admit that I did enjoy this game to some degree - after all, I did effectively finish it in two sittings and a little over twelve hours. The story is fairly typical Quatermain stuff, and makes for some simple escapist nonsense, but unfortunately the game itself is let down a little by repetitive combat sequences and overly simplistic puzzles (though in a couple of cases I found the clues that are given in Allan's legendary notebook to be more than a little obtuse).All in all I'd have to give this game a 6 out of 10 - it's good fun the first time through but I don't see it having all that much replayability, even with the multiplayer options. Buy it if it's on sale at a really good price (60% off or better) or if you're really desperate for a game that mixes Quatermain with Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider, but otherwise leave it alone.(I've selected 'recommended', though to be fair that is a 'mostly recommended')			"

												This game plays like a cross between Tomb Raider (minus all the climbing and whatnot), Indiana Jones (minus the whip), and National Treasure (minus...I dunno, Nick Cage, I guess).  If you can forgive the faults of this game, you can have a good time with it.  It's not perfect: the combat plays like crap, the voice acting flat out sucks in places, and the music loops constantly and gets annoying quickly, but it does have some minor puzzle solving elements that even an impatient person like me can stand.  All that and the level design is really beautiful, especially in the early Egyptian parts, so if anything else enjoy it for the scenery.  I got it on sale for $4.99 and it's worth about that much.

												When I first saw this game on Steam I had never heard about it. I read the description and it said it was a game about exploring, puzzles and gunplay. I love to play adventure games so I put it on my wishlist and bought it in sale for 4.99 EUR.I have just completed it and here's my review:Well, it got me interested until the last boss, let me looking for hidden treasures and the shooting felt satisfying. The puzzles were good aswell. Some I figured out instantly and others got me, a 25 year old educated man, thinking for a while.The biggest thing this game delivers is the environment. The temples are well designed and the outside areas really set the mood. I even had some ""woooow!!""-moments.Here's the downsides: the voice acting wasn't really splendid and cutscene's were clumsy sometimes and OH MY GOD I hated that girl, Jen, so much! She just gets in the way and says stupid, obvious things.The story was, again, not great but decent with a few twists, but not a lot of character development.Some people are complaining about bugs but I encountered just 2 bugs and they didn't obscured my progress so no complains here.So in short: this is a very decent game, made for casual gamers who are looking for an adventure game with about 15 to 20 hours of gameplay. Don't expect a great story or indept characters. Buy it when in sale and you won't regret it.			"

												Contrary to the stupid metacritic rating, there's nothing really wrong with this game!It's basically a Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones exercise with no platforming, less emphasis on puzzles, and heavy emphasis on shooting. And the shooting feels right at home, since the game is made with the well established Unreal3 engine.There is even a sexy sidekick, who supplies the British accent as another reminder of Tomb Raider. Oh, and don't forget the collectibles, used for character ability upgrades.So other than a terrible main character who sounds like a lame cross between Duke Nukem and Postal Dude, this game has great graphics, performance, gameplay, and can be about 10-12 hours long. Surely an excellent choice when on sale!  (No idea about the multi-player stuff, didn't bother.)			"

												If you love a real Indiana adventure this game may be for you. Based off the book series the game Deadfall Adventures is best at keeping an atmosphere not unlike a tomb raider game or an Indiana Jones movie with jungles, ice fields and ancient temples that are all filled with traps and treasures. What works against this game is the very basic gameplay in combat situations however people who find such a game appealing would typically look past such failings and onto what makes this game memorable. Deadfall is a decent adventure for sure.			"

You use flashlight in the same way as in Alan Wake, to make special enemies vulnerable. Oh, and you get to kill Nazis so what's not to like?			"

												I cannot recommend this game at the full $40 price point, however that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not worth trying out at a discount.  The levels are large, gorgeous, and fun to explore and I enjoyed teasing out the solutions to the various puzzles.  However, the game was prone to breaking in frustrating ways, some of which could not be solved by loading a checkpoint; this occasionally rendered treasure collection impossible.  Moreover, the update made substantial changes to the first couple of levels, and that is poorly documented in-game, or indeed anywhere but the Steam forums themselves.   The story, characters, and voice acting are middling at best, but if you can get past that it can be a fun shooter with an action-adventure flair that is sadly in short supply.  Adjust your expectations accordingly and wait for a good deal before you try it out, though.			"

												This game is pretty damn good for what it is. It gets alot of unwarranted hate, which is sad.The game is basically a first person version of those indiana jones games everyone owned when they were kids, whether it was the infernal machine (God i miss that one) Or the emporers tomb, this is a game for people who like being chased by boulders and trying to sharpshoot a switch while a cieling slowly comes down to make you into a pancake. Also, killing nazis never gets old, and the badass guns you get to do it with? Heavenly. Suomi? yes please. Webley revolvers? dont mind if i do! the real pitfalls (Haaa..haaa) In this game come mostly from aesthetics, the cinematics are AWFUL. They look like they were done by a proponent of ancient back braces, every character looks awful in them, but ingame they look fine. The story is sometimes cut out in sound bugs and that sucks too, but its a minor concern as the cutscenes are small and most of what you are going to be doing is battle and puzzles, Quartermain isnt here for story, he wants to shoot people and get rich, which i can relate to.Pick it up on sale for a good few hours of good Indiana jones-style fun.

												This is like the ""Sky Captain: And the World of Tomorrow"" of videogames.A genuine pulp-adventure, but ultimately flawed in many aspects. However, if you can appreciate the good things it has to offer you will have a fun time with it despite it's flaws. Beware though that this game is tetering on♥♥♥♥♥♥and Average, you will only enjoy it if you have specific tastes and a lower threshold for mediocrity.This game has really great atmosphere, a pretty decent amount of variable but simple puzzles, and some really well made unreal engine 3 maps that keep the adventure from becoming too stale. Also there are plenty of forked pathways to find hidden treasure and it seems to be a little different everytime you come upon one.What's average is the gameplay. It's just another one of those FPS games with Call of Duty-itus. Boring linear paths, regenerating health, flat battlegrounds for the most part, aiming down the sights to be able to hit a target, etc. However, something about it feels a tiny bit worse than most generic call of duty-itus shooters.What's really bad is the voice-acting, A.I, cutscenes, and the overall assets. The music is really bland and a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥rip-off of uncharted or something. Voice acting is bad but not in a fun corny way. Gun models and sound effects are amatuer, in fact there are many amatuer UE3 mods that are even better in those regards.I would buy if you are a huge fan of Indiana Jones or Uncharted type things because the atmosphere is amazing in those regards, and if you are an FPS ethusiast who can even enjoy the slightly below average FPS gameplay.

												Graphics are good, but the game-play feels a little slow and cumbersome. Not bad, but not great either! By far and away the biggest letdown is the sound. It’s unconvincing, lacks any sense of realism, and to make matters worse the voice actors are absolutely terrible. The story sections of the game feel like they were directed by an eight year old, and are just embarrassingly poor. So the game is mixed. Some elements are good, some are poor. Overall, I’m afraid this game just fails on too many counts to allow me to recommend it while it's at full price. It needs to drop at least by 50% before you even consider buying it!!			"

												This is a qualified recommendation, since I bought the game on sale for $4 and I think it was worth playing at that price. However, if you're expecting an action-adventure focused game, you will be disappointed. Deadfall is very heavy on the shooting, and it's the ""waves of enemies"" variety. The gunplay is decent, but it still gets tedious. On top of that, the checkpoints are poorly spaced, which means you can be harshly punished for failing to pass a hazard while trying to reach treasure by having to redo a giant firefight all over again. The game feels stretched out too. I'd rather play a shorter and more focused game. None of the issues are deal breakers, but they do prevent the game from ever being all that fun.			"

												Very rare a game has such a great first impression.- Gunshooting is geat- no bullet sponges- it is the first game i played with a indiana jones feeling BUT not as annoying as tomb raiders gameplay. It is a shooter, and it is a great one. - the puzzles are not very challenging but it is realy fair. Some traps are absolutely deadly, if they would be to difficult, it would be frustrating or annoying. The more difficult a puzzle is, the less deadly it is. The more deadly it is, it is less difficult. I think it is done very well.- limited ammo for some weapons will make them more unique and helps alot for diversity in shooting gameplay.- graphics are not AAA maybe, but feels well composited and always suits the situation well.- story is simple, but good.it is a very decent very well made shooter. It doesnt do anything very extraordinary well, but on the other hand, it also does not do anything absolutely wrong. The fun is great, you wont get bored, thumbs up.			"

												Saying this game is inspired by Indiana Jones would be an understatement. Treasure hunting, puzzle solving, ancient traps, single-handedly taking on most of the Nazi army and a mine cart rollercoaster feature prominently.Plotline is enough to keep things moving, although it does little more than that. Characters are archetypical and plotlines are frequently common tropes. That said the gameplay itself is fun and varied. Best of all so far not a single puzzle has required me to go out of game and google for a solution, unlike many other puzzle based games. In fact, I would recommend starting on a difficulty above normal. On the downside there are a few bugs. The animations in cut-scenes are sometimes quite laughable, occasionally the NPC scripts don’t fire off in a timely manner leaving you staring at a gate you can’t open, waiting for them to finish whatever it is NPCs do when not bending to the will of the player. None of these bugs have yet proven game breaking, just mildly irritating. I’ve seen far worse bugs from bigger devs, that’s for sure. Overall – well worth a look, some great fun moments slightly marred by poor game behaviour.  "

												I Love this game!  Its great for anyone who likes a mix of arcade style action and elaborate Indiana Jones Style puzzle solving, minus the whip.  Didn't play the multipler, and I only really bought this game for single player campaign, so I will not touch on the multiplayer in this review.  However, that doesn't mean that I won't try the multiplayer eventually.   You can only get so much out of the single player campaign, especially since there isn't much that seems to be randomized in this game.  I have only played the game on its easiest settings, but it was enough of a challenge for me.  Perhaps that would be too easy for you, but you can play the game on a higher difficulty.Speaking of difficulty.  You can set both the combat difficulty and the puzzle difficulty, to determine how much you want to improve your shooting and mental skills.There are a ton of puzzles in this game, and some of them can be a bit of a challenge even on the lowest setting.  A few will kill you instantly if you make a mistake.  I may still choose to raise the puzzle difficulty the next time I play, since most of them were pretty easy.  In addition, in some cases you can use the traps to kill your enemies, but your timing has to be right, otherwise they will escape unscathed.   It is still a plus through, becouse it adds a bit more stratagy to the game.All of the weapons are great and I really loved how they set it up so that you need to focus the light from your flashlight, ( or ""torch"" as people in the UK call them ) on the mummies in order to kill them.  If you don't, your bullets will not harm them.  You will just keep shooting them until they manage to kill you instead.  That is a pretty unique game play mechanic that makes the mummies far more challenging than they otherwise would be, even though it took me a little while to figure it out.  It was a bit embarrassing given the fact that it kept telling me to use the ""alt key"" to focus the beem.There are also a few plot twists, one of which may shock you.I usually prefer the old school ""look for med kits to replenish your health"" system in video games, particulary first person shooters.  I was a bit disappointed that it had a modern regenerative health system rather than something like the health system in Duke Nukem 3D or Half Life.  Regenerative health systerms usually make games too hard for me, since they tend to really pile on the enemies, assuming the playing is always going to be at full health. However the health system worked well for this game, and I don't think I would change it too much.  It would be really cool through if they added a special hardcore mode where health didn't regenerate and the player had to look for healt packs to restore their health.I also really enjoyed the treasure hunting mechanic.  Its also really nice how you can use the treasure to uprgrade Quertermane's abilities.  However, it would have been better in my opinion if you could have used the treasures to upgrade his abilities in anyway you wanted, instead of having to search for specific treasures for specific abilities.There are a few other improvements they could have made to this game.  Although the weapon design was good, and the choices made sense for the time period that this game takes place ( around World War 2 ) it was a bit of a let down for me that you didn't have any melee weapons.  You can't even use your guns as melee weapons.  Luckily you do have a pistol that has infinate ammo.  You can however swicth pistol with other weapons, but weapons in the pistol slot tend to have infinate ammo.  Weapons in the second gun and explosive slots do not have unlimited ammo. It would have been more realistic if none of your weapons had infinate ammo and instead you could use them as melee weapons when you were low on ammunition.( Minor spoiler warning concerning the enemies in this game )-------------------------For one thing, the enemy variety is a bit lacking.  That may sound strange to anyone who has played the game, given the fact that there are lot of enemies, that said, most of them behave similarly and use similar weapons.  The human enemies may look different from eachother, but they all tend to behave in a similar manner, and for the most part they all seem to have the same number of hit points.   For that reason alone I would have liked it if they could have found a way to include another supernatural enemy in addition to the mummies.  There was a unique mummy / plant creature that I got to fight near the end of the game in South America, however, encounters with that creature were few and far between.  I wish I had encountered them more often, since they really did provide a challenge and were a bit faster and seemed to have more hit points than the normal mummies.  I did see alligators at one point in a cut scene, but I never got to fight them and I was bit dissapointed by that.  Fighting wild animals in addition to the soilders and the mummies could have really added a bit more variety to the combat.------------------------------------------(end of spoilers)Over all this was a great game, in spite of some of its flaws.

												This is one of those bad games that I personally enjoyed for some reason. And I do mean bad.I've noticed a silly argument on it being based on a book series vs. ripping off a movie series. It is based off a book series that also happened to inspire a movie series some. BUT, the game also draws direct inspiration from the movie series. It doesn't ""rip it off"" or anything. But it directly references the movies on multiple occasions. And clearly draws inspiration from the movie's scenes. Which isn't a bad thing! It is based on the book series but also inspired by Junior. I just don't even know why its a discussion But it is. And I just kept it going! Woops, haha. Lots of bad stuff; Graphical glitches*, frame rate drops*, downright silly character animations*, plot holes, plot jumps, invisible walls, places to get stuck, clunky puzzles to get to areas our adventurer could clearly just leap or climb to, mindless AI, and more I can't recall. But worst of all is the silly saving system. Checkpoints that activate after killing certain enemies or triggering certain puzzles. Rather annoying on a game with hidden side treasures and traps that insta-kill. Upon death it reloads you to the checkpoint and you have to get all the side stuff again. There just happened to be a few long distances, with high chances of death, between a few checkpoints that made this a fatal flaw. But for the most part the checkpoints do come often enough. Another time I killed a boss with minions still running about and it triggered a cutscene that, when over, had me standing right in the middle of the surviving minions! I soon died. You can read all the negative reviews that elaborate on all the problems and more I didn't mention. But in the end, I had fun. I really did. This game has some sort of weird charm to it that got a hold of me. Maybe it was the over the top adventure, or the cheesy one-liners, or the puzzles that actually took thought, or a little bit of all of it. It was a fun casual game that took just over 8hrs to complete. I just simply had fun. And you might too! So that's why I recommend it. Do buy it on sale though, it'll ease the rough sections.*I guess I should mention that despite the bad animations, graphical glitches, and frame rate drops, this game does look pretty damn good overall. And then also, I only play single player games and didn't even attempt the multiplayer. EDIT/UPDATE (March 2015); I just would like to mention since playing this I have read a decent handful Allan Quatermain books by H. Rider Haggard and it makes me appreciate this game even more. Just for turning me onto the books! But, that said, I wanted to mention that any fan of the books shouldn't expect anything close to them in the game. Like I mentioned in my review, it borrows from Indiana Jones regardless of being inspired by Quatermain. Now I can flatly state; Beyond the name and it being an adventure, it borrows 95% from Indiana Jones versus 5% from Allan Quatermain. Which makes that whole discussion/argument even more silly. Regardless! I enjoyed the game standing on its own and as a bonus it turned me on to the books! Which I enjoyed for their own reasons and separately. To reiterate though, ""don't expect a Haggard inspired romance from this game at all"" is the supposedly edit worthy point I wished to make.			"

												So, For having been released in 2013 I was a bit let down my the overall graphics. The game was fun to play but felt limited overall. I will finish my playthru but will not probably play it again for a while. I did have an ocasional problem where the screen will pixel out and you cannot see anything. This was uaually after going to a menu and then back to the game.  So all that said if you find it on sale and you like this sort of game I would recommend it. Just don't expect to get a Highly polished game.			"

												If your interested in archaeologist and a fan of of the movies ""The mummy"" and ""Indian jones"" than this game is for you. I enjoyed the game a lot with all the puzzles they placed in the game. The blood splatter was nicely done, the combat was kinda clunky, and the booby traps were intense.Prosfight mummys, germans, demons, etcFind treasuresNice atrmosphere with pyramids, temples, jungles, and cavesbooby trapsCons clunky fire fightsCoop is survival NOT THE MAIN GAME			"

												Game (beta) doesn't work well in Ubuntu 12.04.Start-up takes about 3 min. with heavy Cpu load.Halflife , Awesomenauts, Portal 1 & 2 do work and start-up fast.What a pity & a lost free weekend as well.Better luck next time.Eval 1 of 5 . This 'beta' seems more like an alpha release at least when it comes to performance.Hopefully there will be a working & fast beta and a new free weekend. Otherwise it's not worth bothering.CheersAdu.			"

												You play as James Quatermain, adventurer extraordinaire, coerced into working for Uncle Sam to pay off some gambling debts and to watch the backside of a  would be red-headed adventurer... I mean, watch her back, of course.  Equiped with a compass that finds can find treasure but not magnetic north, a flashlight that can set mummies ablaze, and a pair of pistols with infinite ammo, James Quartermain and his invulnerable sidekick set off to save the world!Let me get something out of the way upfront.  This game does a lot of things wrong: - tutorial text disappears immediately if you're moving when it pops up - most interactable objects look identical to non-interactable objects - some levels have way too many checkpoints while others have none - doors close immediately when you go through them, preventing backtracking and guaranteeing you will miss collectibles - you have limited stamina but no stamina bar - only half of the controls are customizable (not the important half) - some levels have awkwardly placed invisible walls - the maps you find look nothing like the areas they representI could go on... However, although it will take a bit of patience upfront to overcome these flaws, none of them are game-breaking.  Sure, pressing [ALT] for flashlight instead of [F] is a terrible control scheme, but you get used to it. (Especially after the first time you press [CTRL] and crouch instead of [ALT] to burn the mummy trying to eat your face.  You won't make that mistake twice!).  After playing the game for a short while, you kind of stop caring about the flaws and start caring more about the adventure.The game itself feels like a cheaper version of Uncharted.  It has the treasure hunter, the girl, the endless waves of bad guys, and some creepy undead things.  Graphics and voice acting are pretty good despite a few clunky animations.  The puzzles are frequent and actually quite good, plus, the game offers a customizable puzzle difficulty level.  Your grandfather's notebook will contain less clues the higher you set the puzzle difficulty.  The combat is not terribly difficult when set on the Normal difficulty setting, so the game clearly tailors to the players out there who love Adventure Puzzle games.  Your health loss is indicated by some blood splurts and tunnel vision, but just dive behind cover for a few seconds and you'll be good as new.  The game clearly doesn't try to be a fantastic FPS experience, so be forewarned, this game is more about the adventure and puzzles than the combat.I would have like to see a little more environmental storytelling with the game.  You find a stockpile of treasures in each location you visit, but their sole purpose is to trade in for upgrades.  Now you can shoot faster, move faster, reload faster, and run farther, but you know nothing about the areas you explore or the treasures you find.  You'll see an endless supply of ancient architecture, carvings, and statues that do nothing more than provide the requisite atmosphere for each environment.All of these features combine for what is ultimately an okay yet quite enjoyable game.  Don't take the game too seriously and you'll be having fun in no time!			"

												What can I say about this game? THANK god it was only a free trial!The game is so flawed I cannot express how much in a simple review. Firstly, the voice acting is shockingly poor, I would not expect ultra high class from a AAA game, but these voice actors should be shot, flat, monotone in some places and just generally off putting!Graphics - graphically the game is poor and does not make use of the Unreal engine, there are issues with low texture buffering and loading in, load popping and sync issues. I have a decent PC and can run this game without any issue, but this was a low showing effort.Gun play - was shocking!! the guns handled differently on single player than they did in multiplayer, I do not mean a small difference, its like they were different guns! Controls - the controls are slow, clunky and just didnt feel polished in the least, I have played top notch FPS games for years and this game I would easily rate as one of the worst for controls. The controls on multiplayer are different as well, backwards movement is almost like you are not moving at all.....totally pointless when in a gun fight. Staying with MP, when aiming down sights, there is virtually NO recoil, was this done to try and make the game easier so people would stick with it? For whatever reason it was done, it should be undone.Puzzles/Treasures - the puzzles were simple and straight forward to complete (without using the cheat sheet) and the treasures were easy to find, almost making it pointless to have them in the game.Would I recommend this game no anyone? no, is the short answer, I will be removing this game from my hard drive and appologising to said hard drive for installing this worthless pile of garbage on it.

												Nice game, but keeps lagging all the way of recording...Alright...today, anyone could take Unreal engine for penny!Poorly made game...they just didn't tried to use a bit more possibilities!Let's start from script...hmm, Allan Quartermain!Isn't this name looks familiar? Yes, it's from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen with Sean Connery!As I said, it was made poorly, but not that poorly not to impress me.I always glad to see such games, especially on Unreal, which prove that genre is still alive and strong!*lips wasn't sync up properly...it's like in TMNT 2: The Secret of Ooze*Our protagonist is quite charismatic, and...AAAAAA, I can't silent anymore!HE WAS SKETCHED FROM UNCHARTED! JUST LOOK AT HIM!He looks like if Drake was age 38, but James was age 43. And they looks identical!...He can't swim! HE CAN'T SWIM! ...It's GTA-syndrome of hydrophobia, not again!Even Lara Croft could swim...at least, she's a bit prettier.His catchy phrases are ugly! It's all about it! Last game that I remember where they're was used is Starfox 64, and it was fine!*I hate part when you solved the puzzle with two buttons, and everything start to erypt. Falling rocks looks like polygonal crap, and their speed ia always changing on all way of falling...looks like they didn't about gravity*Sometimes you really need a map! I don't like it!...And flashlight...where did i put my common sense?WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ING PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥? WHY DID THEY DO THAT?WHAT'S WRONG WITH GOD-DAMN FLASHLIGHT???WHY IT SUPPOSED TO KILL ENEMIES LIKE IN ALAN WAKE, WHERE YOU NEED TO BURN A DARK ARMOR FROM THEM WITH BRIGHT LIGHT! ♥♥♥♥!...Yeah, yeah, what's a point to write a review without beating the game?Well...I just can't play anymore. Better play in Tomb Raider: Anniversary (PS2 version is a little bit better because of bonus content), and you will understand why!This is it!P.S I'm thinking that Jennifer is double agent! It's cliche, and I hope that I was wrong, really!About Digital Deluxe Edition...are they freaking kidding? ... Damn you, developer!			"

												I swear to god I am so sick and tired of these god damn game breaking glitches in this damned game, and is at certain points unbearable just rawly due to the glitches. And this isn't the funny kind of glitches when you can just sit back and laugh it, no sir these are glitches that ruin the gameplay, might I add.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Deadfall Adventures is in general a fairly done and surprisingly really fun game. The campaign is the best part, the multiplayer I will get to later, which I will let you know right off the bat is god awful due to a very bad reason. The Campaign took me a bit of time to beat and was really fun, except for the god damn glitches. Theres SO many of those in this game, and that is the main problem with this game. I could list a ♥♥♥♥ing cooking recipe of glitches and bugs this game has to offer, but i'll just save you the trouble and list a few of the most annoying and most ridicilous ones ive encountered in my playtime:AI stuck running toward wall until provokedIn mutliplayer, when you line up for a headshot with a weapon like a sniper, around 45% of the time it doesnt even get a hitmarker or the kill, you just see blood come out of the head, and then its random how many more times youll have to shoot until he is dead. This got so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying for me while grinding for the gun upgrades, and this occured so much I even rage quitted once due to it, I have lost count of how many times this occured after around 50 times.You can see your arms above your guns sometimes. This can be fixed by switching to a weapon and back.Lip syncing can be off sometimesStuck with unlimited ammo if loading a game sometimesAnd many, many more.  The Campaign: In general, the campaign is fairly done and has a decent story, although its hard as hell to keep track of if your not paying enough attention. The puzzles in this game are confusing as ♥♥♥♥ due to how your ""notepad"" shows you every single puzzle anwser AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME. This means that you have to take 5 mins to just find the puzzle you are looking for, and trust me SO many of the puzzles look exactly the same. Theres also the raw gameplay. This is the best part, its got lots of shooting, and so many guns to pick up and shoot. But what Deadfall Adventures does worst at is it's traps. For the record I will say I saw so many more traps in MULTIPlAYER than I did in the actual CAMPAIGN. This would not even be a big deal or even in my review if they didn't act like the game was gonna have so many unique traps. They lied :). So, when you mold everything together and conect all the pieces, the final verdict of the campaign is a solid 6.5/10, a decent campaign, fairly enjoyable and well-paced. Btw, my final verdict was without including the glitches and bugs, just the raw game itself. The Multiplayer (Oh BOY) The multiplayer...oh goodie do I have a thing or two to talk about this mode. The multiplayer itself is really, REALLY good! But like I said before, the glitches just had to come in and ruin all of it. Im not going to make an essay on this mode, but I am going to give you a summary of my opinion on this multiplayer. The multiplayer is bad due to the glitches and bugs; failed headshots, sprinting not functioning, weapons disappearing, only my gloves visible, etc. There are many gamemodes to choose from and are all really fun to play with. Unfortunatley, like almost every other game like this, the multiplayer is dead. Literally. There is not 1 single person on any gamemode in this entire game, and I feel if this game had no glitches or bugs, or if it got patches, it would have so many player on it right now. Final Verdict Deadfall Adventures is great on its own, but due to the glitches and bugs, it makes the game get a such lower score than it really deserves. The campaign is amazing, but on the other hand, the multiplayer is just bad due to the glitches and outrageous bugs it comes along with. But of course the game's glitches make it so unenjoyable and harsh to play. So, with all of this being said, my Final Verdict for Deadfall Adventures is a:  4/10  A bad game to play! "

												I'm flabbergasted by this one. It's a stupid game with♥♥♥♥♥♥easy ""puzzles"" and moronic enemy AI. With the Linux version, it takes about 20 minutes to get from pressing the play button to an actual level. That's 20 minutes of load time alone! When it finishes loading, you'll get to kill humans, kill mummies or watch mummies kill humans. And while that might sound like fun, it was way more fun to type this sentence since the game does the standard COD thing. You know that COD thing; where your only HP indicator is the blood splatters on the screen and your HP regens quicker than they can kill you, so if you ever think you're going to die, you just hide in a corner and pluck a couple nosehairs until all the raspberry jelly on the screen goes away and you're good to go.The ""puzzles"" can vary from performing complexed actions like pushing a button, to pulling a lever, to rotating rocks with symbols on them. In one such situation, I had to rotate two rocks next to a door to find the right combination of symbols to open the door. Some experienced puzzle-solvers would look around the room to find hints, and if they did, they would notice the answer is carved on the ♥♥♥♥ing door. I'm not making this up. It's carved on the door two feet away from the rocks. It's HUGE, too. You can't miss it. All you have to do look slightly up and you'll see it. But just in case you do miss it, the game even tells you to check your in-game notebook, which flat out tells you exactly the same thing. Both rocks, same symbol. The same exact ♥♥♥♥ing symbol that also happens to be the same exact ♥♥♥♥ing answer to the last 4 ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles. And it's like that with every puzzle. The notebook is always there to spoonfeed every answer to you, like you're going to forget all the puzzles have the same exact solution. And the notebook wouldn't be such a bad thing except the game always tells you to check it first.The only puzzle that proved to be a challenge was the one where there are three buttons to stand on to make a statue slide out of the way. Your uterus sidekick stands on one, you shoot a sarcophagus to make a mummy fall out and land on another, then you stand on the last. And from there? No idea. I tried to run and jump through the gap in the wall, I spammed grenades every where, I tried to kill the ovary-keeping sidekick a few times and nothing worked. I eventually gave up and checked the forums. Apparently, beating this puzzle was supposed to trigger the next cutscene or whatever and that just wasn't happening. So the stupid♥♥♥♥♥puzzle was bugged the whole time?! I refuse to waste anymore time on this one. Crappy, buggy, easy, overpriced, eyecandy game. Uninstalled. Deleted save file. Smashed computer with a hammer. Not worth it.			"

												I wish I had better to say about this game. The puzzles are pretty interesting and there's a lot of good elements that kept me playing through to the end of the demo, but most of what I saw only reminded me of better games. Most egregiously, it straight-up stole the ""boost your flashlight's beam to make supernatural enemies vulnerable to bullets"" mechanic from Alan Wake. It's been a while since my reaction to something in a game was a flat ""...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"".The gunplay felt ripped straight out of Call of Duty with the usual regnerating health, cover-based, two-weapons-only bag of tricks. The general setting of the game is an obvious homage to Indiana Jones that straddles the line between tribute and knockoff. There's a fair number of minor visual bugs mixed with a couple spots of lazy animation. In all it's interesting, but really only average. You could do much worse, but you could do much better.			"

												This was a very disappointing game for many reasons. It seems like it could be great, but it's just not.Mainly, because it's very buggy. Try to take cover behind objects in the environment, and chances are you'll end up stuck, and have to load the game to get out. The cutscenes are really quite buggy as well. Quartermain (the protagonist) can often be seen weilding what appears to be modern semi-automatic pistols in cutscenes, yet these do not appear at any point in the game. In other cutscenes he weilds his revolvers, which are actually weapons in the game. Sometimes he's wearing a hat in one cutscene, it's gone in the next, yet mysteriously reappears in the one after that. No explaination there.There are tons of bugs though. Sometimes the FOV gets stuck after zooming in with a weapon, so the player's view is zoomed in while the weapon is no longer being aimed, or even wielded. Sometimes when switching between the compass or notepad and a weapon, it gets stuck, making combat impossible until the game is re-loaded.Sometimes the player is killed by traps that are too far away to possibly do any harm (such as being killed by a spear coming through the floor a few feet to the player's side)Attempting to jump over even small objects is pointless. Even though the player does appear to jump to a decent height, attempting to jump over a small rock or crate is impossible, and usually just results in getting stuck inside it. Occasionally for no appearent reason, the notepad or compass will sort of jiggle around or float above the player's hand. Other annoyances seem intentional, such as all of the insta-death traps, invisible walls that kill the player, and the fact that for some reason Quartermain dies on contact with water. Falling any distance is pretty much survivable, even though there is falling damage. However dropping off of a low ledge into an area the devs don't want you going results in instant death, and it's not always easy to tell where you aren't meant to go.These annoyances wouldn't be too terrible if it wasn't for the checkpoint system being used somewhat sparingly. Dying can send you back half a level.Quartermain's voice acting is terrible and sounds forced. Which is particularly odd when you consider the fact that every other character in the game seems to have decent voice actors.The puzzles are pretty disappointing as well. They don't make you think at all. Most of them make absolutely no sense without using the notebook which the game constantly nags you to open with text that pops up on the screen. The notebook pretty much gives step by step instructions on how to solve each puzzle. There's nothing to solve, just instructions to follow that tell you exactly what to do.The combat is bland as well. It comes in short bursts, and there are really no surprises. Whenever you're about to enter any kind of combat, you usually get a cutscene first, or at the very least hear the enimies loudly talking which gives far too much warning. To inspire exploration, there are artifacts hidden throughout the game as well, however most of which are hidden in plain sight, and if any aren't, your compass points you right to them. To make things even easier, if you don't have the compass out when you're in the general area of an artifact, an indicator flashes on the screen, and if that doesn't make it easy enough, there's even a treasure map for each level. But these artifacts don't seem to do all too much. You can trade them in for upgrades at statues, but the upgrades are very subtle. A little more health, a little faster reload time... and i didn't really notice much of any difference after upgrading the attributes, so it's hardly worth it. The story line is pretty bad too. -MILD SPOILERS HERE- You spend the entire game looking for pieces of an artifact, then by the end of the game, you never figure out what it really is, or even what it does. The final boss uses it to become... powerful in some rather generic way, then it's gone when you defeat him. I had very high expectations for this game, because i really do tend to enjoy this genre, but this game... not so much. Certainly not worth $40. If you can pick it up in a sale for well under $10, maybe give it a try. But it's actually a pretty terrible game. Incredibly buggy too. If it were an early access game, i could forgive it, but it's not.			"

												Good Fun. The majority of the game is made up with grand shooting segments. Deadfall pits you in large rooms full of cover to hide behind and weapons to swap between. This basic approach actually does Deadfall justice. Far removed from the rollercoaster feel of other recent shooters, there’s room to manoeuvre, plan an attack, and execute.			"

Quite disapointed, I know its still in beta stage but I dont think it's ready yet, It still needs a lot of work. I started the tutorial and because it was stuttering I couldn't shoot targets properly, the cut scenes went on for what felt like forever, I just couldn't enjoy playing the game.			"

												The game is not impressive, the shooting sections are not interesting at all, the ""shine your light on mummies"" mechanic gets boring straight away (not to mention the burned images they cause on the screen for no apparent reason), puzzles are ridiculously easy and the plot is uninspired and uninteresting. I can't say much of the graphics because I played it in very low settings, any other way would cause massive lag, so I won't put my finger on it, but I'm not hooked on a game because of the graphics.This game has nothing new to offer. You can pretty much go out in the middle of a gunfight and you won't die, but get close to anyone and they'll 1HKO you instantly. Seriously? I can even say that for the puzzles, they're something you can do through trial and error, but they're all just so easy anyway. The mirror puzzle made me think you'd need to light them all up at once. That would've been cool. But no. Instead you gotta light them one by one. ""Oh, the ceiling is falling? Well, don't worry, it won't crush your partner until you've found out what to match"". There's literally no pressure for doing anything in this game.Also, 30 bucks without discount? You'd have to be kidding me. A big no to this game.			"

												This is an okay game, which is sad, because it feels like it could have been a great game.In brief, you play James Quatermain, the grandson of H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain, a fictional big game hunter who spent most of his life in Africa, seeking to improve the lives of the native people without destroying their culture--so, Allan wasn't a terrible guy, and the simple fact is...the game should have been about him. In their desire to emulate all the Quatermain knockoffs, primarily Indiana Jones, the developers instead make an Indiana Jones knockoff. You fight Nazis who are trying to steal some ancient relics that are mysterious sources of power, bring a potential love interest along, have, for a while, a wise cracking cohort (somewhat surprisingly a German), and solve puzzles while ruining ancient tombs. So, the story is somewhat lacking.Gameplay wise, it's nothing special. Combat works alright. There's a limit cover mechanic, though shooting out of it isn't smooth, grenades aren't devastating to you or your enemies. There's a flashlight mechanic for dealing with risen mummies that's straight out of a horror game, and even on higher difficulty settings makes them the least dangerous enemies except in occasional swarms.There's a system for increasing your skills and attributes, but you could go the entire game without doing it and not suffer. It works based on locating artifacts that give you points, and a sufficient number of points let you up things like health, stamina, weapon reload time, the flashlight enhancing skill, and so on. But, again, their help is minimal, and it feels tacked on. Also tacked on: treasure maps that show you where the artifacts are, but without a birds eye view for location context, they're not all that useful.The puzzles are kind of fun, but if you take too long, your female companion starts spouting off a helpful line of dialogue--just one, over and over and over, until you want to shoot her.Things that would've added greatly: Better characterization. The sexual tension was laughable, and the script could definitely use a once-over. More back and forth between the characters would've actually been okay for those long walks between combat sessions, while the combat dialogue could've used more than the female character always complaining that the Nazis were moving closer to her. This was especially true in one hilarious context in which she was nowhere near the action, just waiting for me to take a standard slow video game elevator down while under fire. She was in literally no danger, and just kept repeating that one line over and over.A better spread of weapons, or modifiable weapons, would've been nice.Some sort of stealth mechanic would've actually gone a long way. You disarm occasional traps, how about setting some?And, finally, the lead character feels wrong. If the devs wanted to do a story in Quatermain's universe, how about doing one about Quatermain?I feel like this is one of those rare instances where a sequel could outshine its original. It's a pretty firm 7/10. Grab it on sale, play it once, forget about it.			"

However, if you are the type that wants everything perfect this is not what you are looking for. The voice acting, as well as the character movement (especially the hands :P) is terrible. The FPS aspect could be better but its not that bad. In total I enjoyed that game a lot because of its sceneries and its puzzles, that although get a little bit repetitive they are overall enjoyable.			"

												I usually reserve reviews until I finish the game, but I am confident I will do so.  I think it's a ton of fun.  I'm playing on hard puzzles (though that's a bit of an exaggeration) and medium combat (although I could probably bump it up to hard since I haven't had any trouble there either).  I think it's a good mix of exploration and action.  The dialogue could use some work but that's about my only complaint, and I quite like that the combat is limited to areas where you know there are going to be bad guys and it isn't like the similarly themed game, the Ball, where you have to handle the combat and exploring/puzzling at the same time.About my only complaint is that it's easy to leave an area accidentally and then you can never return; so it's possible I've missed a few secrets but I will never know.  I wouldn't mind a confirmation screen and one which tells me to what percent I've completed the area.			"

												Combine the most annoying problems in PC gaming (texture popping, fiddly controls) with boring adventure movie cliches and you get Deadfall Adventures! Witness the most boring game to ever feature an action sequence within 5 minutes of the gameplay starting which also takes another 15 minutes of cutscenes which are completely pointless to get to! Broken shooting mechanics which make the game unintentionally difficult at times! A starter weapon which is completely useless to begin with and hitboxes so small, they would make Carlton look like Andre The Giant.Voice acting so bad it makes Facade look like Metal Gear Solid in comparison, graphics that don't really look that great to begin with and generic characters so generic that you lose the complete ability to be interested in them or involved in their boring stories.Please do not buy this game. The screenshots might look pretty and the premise might seem good at first, but the game itself is a broken, boring and useless mess. Play something else; anything else!			"

												Well I missed this game when it first came out and thanks to an online buddy for turning me on to it! I'm having quite a bit of fun with it. Nordic Games have a bright future, they are still rough around the edges a bit and certain areas of this game could've been more polished (voice-acting being my biggest complaint). The core gameplay keeps me playing through and it has enough variety to keep me entertained throughout thanks to scenery changes and the different types of enemies. Yes, the combat could be a bit better but I really like how the guns feel and sound quite authentic. If you see this game available at a reasonable price and you are a fan of action-adventure games (i.e. the new Tomb Raider reboot...which I thought was amazing and the Uncharted games) this game is right up your alley. Being a fan of Indiana Jones does help a bit too! :) Forget the awful Alan Quartermaine movies from the 80's though... although this game's voice acting isn't top notch it's still better than those movies! The developer listens to the community (just look what they did with Red Faction G! They totally ripped out GFWL and have put a lot of time and effort implimenting community suggestions and the game is now better than ever. The reboot of Painkiller they did was also well done although I wish they'd do a completely NEW title for the franchise and make it great to get recognition. Well to sum it all up this game is a fun romp (even the multiplayer is decent) and I'd most certainly recommend it to any FPS fan who doesn't expect AAA titles with every game they play. Play this game knowing it could be better but enjoy it for what it is! Nordic Games have a bright future indeed and I'll be keeping my eye on them for sure.			"

""Arctic Nazi Submarine Mummies? Any other time that might be unusual.""Deadfall Adventures is a decent first person shooter, action adventure game, with fun puzzles and beautiful graphics, but with voice acting, dialogue, and repetitive combat that brings it down. Good idea that seemed rushed, unpolished, and left with untapped potential. Worth one playthrough of decent length, not much to come back for though.*Gameplay*+ Decently fun, good distraction+ Some great puzzles- A lot of tedious and/or boring puzzles+ Combat is mildly entertaining+ Mummies!- Repetitive combatSome very cool, and interesting puzzles, surrounded by many tedious, boring puzzles that bring down the overall quiality of the game. Combat is fun but gets repetitive quite quickly, but having mummies and occasionally changing the weapons and appearance of enemies helps keep it sort of interesting.*Graphics*+ Beautiful Environments+ Amazing Graphics, the water, plants, ect, all looked great- Not enough varietyAmazingly looking graphics and beautiful environments throughout the game. Plants, water, enemies, temples, everything looks well-polished, but what it makes up for in quality, it lacks in variety. Many environments ( which takes place in different parts of the world ) look almost identical with little variation.*Dialogue/Cutscenes/Story*+ Occasionally something interesting would happen+ Decent story- Slow quite often- Painful, PAINFUL dialogue- Clunky cutscenesThe story in Deadfall Adventures is mildly interesting at best, with only a few moments of actual true interest, despite it being quite predictable. Slow throughout the whole game, clunky cutscenes that are badly executed, and some of the worst dialogue I have seen in a game in a while. It was cringe worthy half the time and the other half I simply felt embarrassed for them.*Exploration/Adventuring Aspect*+ Fun side puzzles occasionally+ Feel like you're actually on an adventure at times- Pretty linear path- Minimal actual ""exploration"" (More just looking around in a decently sized area for a shiny)The exploration aspect is almost non-existent, however; they have mini puzzles when attempting to retrieve artifacts that make them interesting enough for me to look for them. You are basically on one path, look around the area for artifacts you can find, move on to the next area, and get locked out from going back, forcing you to replay an entire section if you wish to go back. *Overall*I recommend this game, but get it on sale. It is entertaining enough to play through, collect what artifacts you can, and enjoy a decently engaging story (if you can get passed the very painful, and often times embarrassing dialogue).Good for one playthrough, wouldn't go back for a second time, but good enough game to pass the time. Very good idea, but feels rushed and badly executed throughout. Decent combat and fun puzzles bring this game up, but frustrating, tedious puzzles, and repetitive combat situations bring the game down in quality and enjoyment. I personally did not try multiplayer as I have zero interest, considering I disliked the combat in singleplayer.Buy it on sale. "

												This was pretty bad from what I played, it's pretty much a rip off of indiana jones in the Serious Sam 3 engine (it pretty much is just Serious Sam 3 with Indiana Jones instead of Sam). The cuts scenes were poorly done, the dialouge had a forced delivery and was bland and the NPC's could talk right in your ear from across the map (Mainly to spew the same line every 40 seconds because you were looking around instead of rail roading to the next poorly done cut-scene.) The puzzles were hardly puzzles, one look and you could probably guess how to get by them making the journal system useless.  Combat was bland, basically Serious Sam 3's combat with chest high walls enforced (they even took the SS3 dual pistols as a starting weapon and added a little animation when idle)Seriously, I'm glad it had a free weekend so I could see how poorly done it was before I even noticed it existed.

												This game has a large variety of puzzles that are challenging enough to hold the players interest until the end of the game. However, be prepared to google or look at some youtube videos if you're a player with less patience. This game attempts to imitate the atmosphere that is present in other titles, such as. Tomb Raider and in most cases delivers. However, the plot of the campaign is rather dull storywise, with the main protaganist providing generic one liners. The gun play is basic but effective and the game is well-optimized. I didn't experience almost any large FPS drops or glitches while playing through the campaign. I rate this game 7.5/10. This game is definitely worth picking up when it is discounted.			"

												An action adventure in spirit, a joyful ride FPS in actuality.   The game is a mix between the movies of Indiana Jones and Allan Quatermain, with a touch of Tomb Raider and a taste of Alan Wake, in first person.You are on an adventure which will take you through several locations, trying to end this well.  There are plenty of underground locations and some above.  There are lovely cutscenes and beautiful scenery to enjoy.  According to Steam stats it took me about 12 hours to complete on average difficulty.  Sounds about right.  Don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy it for what it is.  A fun ride.  I was 100% satisfied for what I got for my money.  I do hope there is going to be a sequel at least in spirit.  I did a let's Play on youtube if anyone wants to have a look, but I strongly recommend to just buy the game if any of the above sound interesting to you.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtpqh8ebqvxdlZR6lByNkV_pY17BZsoZz "

												Deadfall Adventures is an exploration-oriented, first-person adventure game with some shooting and puzzles, including puzzles that involve shooting and shooting sequences that require solving puzzles to survive them.The story is a typical Quatermain-style adventure - while it won't win a Hugo, if you like punching Nazis, shooting Commies, immolating mummies, or applying dynamite to irreplaceable archeological treasures, there is something here for you. The fighting sequences are mainly creative and well done - I enjoyed them more than, say, Bioshock Infinite's. The puzzles are generally straightforward, but they establish a nice, relaxed pace between the high-tension action segments. I took about 20 hours to play through the single-player campaign - I attempted to collect most of the optional treasures, at least the ones that were semi-obvious, along the way. ""Normal"" difficulty combat was perfectly doable with a gamepad - if you're using a mouse, I'd bump it up to ""Hard.""Thanks to The Farm 51 and Nordic Games for porting this to Linux - I played the complete game on Ubuntu 14.04 x86-64. There are a couple of technical issues, but I'm not sure if they're Linux-specific or not: Load times are massive, over 5 minutes for a ""cold start""; the gamepad mappings are odd - ""Jump"" and ""Use"" are mapped to the same button, so you need to hold LB to interact with things (or perform mêlée attacks), which simultaneously toggles your flashlight.Overall, I would recommend this game to fans of the genre.

												I really can't recommend this game i played for the free weekend bit which its only for the multiplayer but lets you try the first to areas in singleplayer. so first graphics never really a factor for me but I'll be honest it doesn't look awfully great the enviroment was interesting.story/characters kind boring and none of the characters  make it difficult to care about then and with the typical plot of nazi's are trying to use otherworldy powers to do bad things and you have to fight them to save the world again very tired and played out scebariogameplay standard FPS shooting with some puzzle solving shame the puzzles shift from laughable easy to sierra snydrome it makes sense to the developer but not the player ex. shoot this casket to drop a body on a man he'll drop a grenade which will knock over a statue to open your forward path .final verdict not really worth the money its bland and feels that it will get old and repetitive fast another game that could have been good but just isn't another case of so close yet so far.

												not sure about how the story is, or the competitive multiplayer, but the survival mode is definitely... lacking. I spent only a short time playing it during the free weekend, and all I can say is, with 2 players and on EASY, the enemies are near invulnerable (takes all your ammo to kill ONE of the weaker enemies), and the easiest method to kill them is to make use of the dozens of traps placed around each of the maps. This makes for very dull gameplay, where you feel like scooby doo on the run from a bad guy, just running around, and timing the traps which you have to SHOOT to activate, and kill the enemies with.Could have been better, but if the easiest survival mode was this dull, I can only imagine how awful the competitive is, and how dull the campaign must be. If the campaign were COOP it would give the game some redemption, but its not, sadly. The story looks like it could be interesting but I have no interest in playing through this game alone.			"

												Personal Rating: 1/10I'm being generous when I give this catastrophe a 1/10. The voice acting is awful. I could do better voice acting while being strangled. The voice overs sound bored and their voices are drowned out by the quietest of sounds. It stinks of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, which is funny because it references them both in the first 3 minutes of the game. I haven't got a clue what the main characters name is, it isn't estalbished. The multiplayer is just a Call of Duty clone that didn't need adding on. Community is awful, I got kicked from the match for being too good. It's a real mystery how this game was sold. I'd rather PLAY a Tomb Raider or Indiana Jones game.Another thing. £32.99 ♥♥♥♥ING POUNDS. That's a literal robbery, I'm serious. It's not worth it, anyone who buys that game is rich enough to waste money. If you want to waste money then burn it or play TF2 or something. Jesus Christ I've never seen something so expensively♥♥♥♥♥♥ WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?			"

												Downloaded this on the free weekend, if i didnt would never have heard of this. Not a bad thing. I only manage to get through the first chapter before i had to end the game, might seem i didnt give it a proper shot but i can usualy. The controls felt clunky WASD moved fine, but pushed the button (say crouch) and it did but felt rather robotic. The biggest faw in the controls is that they game makers (i think tried) to use and few keys as possible which is usualy a good thing but when say tring to melee and it might pull up the selection bit (for guns/notes). Probably doesnt matter much but when pressing E for actions, it triggers not when u press E but when u press and realese. Might batter later if you on a time based action/run/sprint/puzzle thing.Voice acting was terible it felt flat like they actors couldn't be bothered. Much like a bad audiobook flat as a pancake. And what is said is niether interesting or importantThe puzzles at least at the start were simple and required no real effort and pretty much stolen/cookie cutter of many other puzzles (such as ste only on these stones). One ""puzzle"" being push the button til the light thingy tirned til it was painfuly obvious it was righSkill system/treasures, if there really treasures why are they so easy to fine, get hold of. and as for the skills, more health stamind. oh look i can reload faster. I dont expect to be superman but it just seeemed half bakedThe character models have been poorly made particualy when they die, there arms will go through floors/themselfs.The multiplayer is really shady and i could count the number of servers on my hand, i think i could use one after the free weekend. I could not even bring myself to plat a third round.Again more clunck in the controls with akward sprinked on top. All of a sudden moving backwards is a shore and aiming down sights had no recoil.All in all the game has potential, with some polish and refinement to make it feel more fluid and better puzzles (try watching the crystal maze for ideas?)Even I i paid a fiver for this game i would feel robbed. Hell i wouldn't pirate the game. And as for the the reviews with average hrs, it reckon they have opened the game and went away, gave it a good review got paid.More Clunk Than Ker-Plunck			"

												This game desperately wants to be the Indiana Jones action-adventure game that never existed.  To some extent, it succeeds, riding on the coattails of a lot of what made Raiders of the Lost Ark and Allan Quatermain great.  Unfortunately, dull combat against hordes of nearly identical enemies that don't do much doesn't help matters, and although many of the puzzles are pretty good (and the ""notepad"" hint system nice), and the environs mostly pretty, there's a sad repetitiveness to it and the acting is bluntly pretty bad.  The section in the ice temple area seems to drag on way too long.  Basically, the game seems like it was rushed or incomplete... more time needed to be invested in enemy design and AI and more variety in the shootybangs sequences.  All in all, just kind of ""meh"".			"

												This is a must have game, especially if you're a Linux user! I'd say the game is somewhere between Wolfenstein and Tomb Raider. Very well constructed and designed. Sensible and absolutely enjoyable, apart from a few annoying parts, that you have to do over and over again. But, which game doesn't have those parts? It's a FPS, but some puzzle to tackle with, which makes it more interesting. So it's not just shoot them up and that's it. Very colour full and the environment is keep changing throughout the game. I'd say it's getting more and more difficult to find a good game out there lately. It's all about zombies these days, which I find very boring. Although, this has some of them too, I still feel like it's a spot on game. Think about Return to castle of Wolfenstein. Probably it's the closest game I'd mention. Very sorry for the lack of Linux support. The game freezes very often when a video or some additional data is about to be loaded. Starting of the game is a little bit long, but be patient it's worth it. Sometimes, it's just stops and you have to restart the game. If you are a Linux user, as I've mentioned it, it's a must have game, not only for the fun but for the support as well. You won't be disappointed.Hoping this game will become a series.			"

												This game is very buggy, but in singleplayer at least, all the bugs I've come across have been innocent, charming ones, like ending up with a handheld flashlight with your tommy gun instead of the gun mounted one it should be, so it looks like you have 3 hands.  Also, the cutscenes, AI, and voice acting aren't very good, but no worst then most budget games of this style of gameplay.So with all of it's problems I will recommend this game (when it's on sale) to two groups of people, people who really, really like Indiana Jones, The Mummy, or anything similar, and people who just saw one of those movies or whatever and want a simple first person shooter to go along with it.

												I am trying not to let my loathing of the protagonist and his companion color my review too much, but if you have an option to turn off the spoken dialog and go with subtitles you will probably enjoy the game much more. I am playing the game on Normal/Normal. Probably should up the combat difficulty as the soldiers and Dark enemies really are kind of a joke. Puzzle difficulty is hard enough for me as these are more distractions than the whole point of the game for me. The notebook pretty much gives you the answer to any puzzle you HAVE to get past, Weapon variety is good, and you are given the tools to get through each level - so much so that you pretty much know what is going to happen next just by seeing what is laying around. The mine cart scenes where too much. WAY too much of a steal from Indiana jones for a game that is already riding firmly on Indie's coat tails. Plus, these scenes are of little interest. I think you could really just sit there and not bother shooting or looking around and you would end up with the same results. The game claims to be about exploration - but does not give you the opportunity in many places. You are not sure which areas trigger a level transition and which do not, so if you happen down the wrong path at some point you can no longer retrieve the treasures that trigger your character progression. The game is worth what I paid for it (~$9) but you would feel gipped if you paid more.			"

												This game is one of the few games that pay homage to a book/comic set that do it well. I went into this game with low expectations to be honest, it didn't look like it would get my attention. After finishing it i went straight to look at the books and fell in love with the lore of it all.The score of this game is fantastic for its setting and style. The voice acting, could be a little better but is at least decent. The characters are fully fleshed out, including the sarcastic s*** you play as that you can't help but like. The guns are standard, but that is not what this game is about, the puzzles are where this game shines. The game essentially gives you the answer to every puzzle in a book you can hold in game, but doing a play through without its help makes the game even better.My only thing that really annoyed me is the final boss, it does not tell you what to do and it is a bit of a weird one, as *spoiler alert* you have to look up and blow up something*. All in all, great game even with all the nay sayers in the review section.			"

												If you're one of those who likes the Indiana Jones movies and the Uncharted games, then this might be a game for you. It's a first person shooter where you shoot yourself through a temple in Egypt, a temple in the Arctic, the ""Mayan"" jungle and also a Mayan temple... as earlier stated; Much like Indiana Jones and Uncharted.The year is 1938, you take the role as James Lee Quatermain and he gets the mission to escort Jennifer Goodwin into a temple in Egypt - go in, get the thing she's after and then get out, that kind of job. But as you're probably aware of, things go south... quickly. And you need to set things right. That's a simple way to explain the story.It looks GREAT. They did a great job (for the most part) with the models (the lip syncing went haywire towards the end of the game) and textures and environments, but when it comes to sound... that leaves a whole lot to be desired. The voice acting is not very good at all. Although the music is decent. The AI is hit and miss, sometimes it rushes you for no good reason, sometimes it just stays behind cover for no reason.So, in short, the game is ""hit and miss"". It's fun, keeps the player entertained throughout the eight hour long ""Adventure"" mode and there's a lot of puzzles throughout, most required to complete to be able to continue. But there shouldn't be any issues completing them, not if you're asking me. I bought the game for €3.99 and I wouldn't go over that if interested in buying it.			"

												So Deadfall Adventures. Where to begin? This is an interesting game that is apperently based on some old stories from H. Rider Haggard. A wrtier from the late 1800s/early 1900s. The game alot like Indiana Jones, The Mummy, King solomans mines and all those other old movies about Adventure man goes to find treasure with Hot foreign girl. I bought this game because I previously played Necrovision and its prequal lost company which the Farm 51 also made. Those were basically doom 3 but ww1. So I thought this would be the same in terms of gameplay. Those games had a terrible story but funny gameplay. This game is nothing like that. It has a decent story obviosly like I said before based on stories and mediocre game play. It tries to do something special with a flash light mechanic but other then just shoot the enamies a lot there isnt much there. It seems also after the graphics update the removed several guns from the campaign and changed animations. In necrovision the guns were pretty well model and the animations were good. Here the guns share very little with their real life counter part. The revolver is pretty bad you remove the entire cylinder from the gun and put in a new one. I watch older videos of this game and it had the correct reload before but they changed it for no reason. The gun play is just meh nothing great. The graphics with everything old the highest are good thow some textures like the water and lava dont look great. The water looks like jelly and the lava like cheese. But generaly the graphics are good. The enamy variety is pretty unique there is a good variety thow they all die in the same way. Shine a flash light on them until they change color then unload on them. Thats for the monsters. Then we have 3 different human factions. Nazi's because every story needs nazis, Soviets because there is Nazis, and Arabs because reasons. Other then shooting the gameplay consist of puzzles, some are fun some are pretty boring. Most are solved by shooting, the others by your flash light or other light source. The dialog is prety good compared to necrovision which I am sad about because necrovision had terrible dialog which was funny. All the voice actors in this game are pretty good, accept for the Nazi guy who helps you his voice didnt fit his body type or look. I am going to recommend this game only if you really want something that harkons back to movies like the Mummy or Indiana jones but isnt movie game. 6.5/10.  I recorded a lets play of this game I will be posting the videos soon. My youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/TroopperFoFo "

												Stuck somewhere between action adventure and first person shooter, Deadfall Adventures occupies an epicly mundane place in a genre filled with legendary competition. The tasteless and clunky mechanics leave much to be desired, and the aesthetic elements are graphically lacking. This game tries to deliver too much, and ends up falling flat on all fronts in the footsteps of household names like TombRaider. If you have an urge to putz around a bland and choppy linear environment solving mindless grinding puzzles then this is the title for you!			"

												Don't. Just don't. When I bought this game I was amazed by how good a game could look on the store page and how bad it could actually be. Deadfall Adventures combines boring puzzles with even worse fps elements, creating a game i cannot recommend to anybody. While the graphics may be pretty decent at some points, I could not motivate myself to keep playing after a couple of hours. Now some of you might say ""he doesn't know what he's talking about, the game becomes great after 10, 15 hours of gameplay."" I'm sorry, but, in my opinion, a game that can't keep you addicted -or even just interested- for 10 hours, is just not a good game.   graphics 6/10gameplay 3/10story 4/10			"

It's way more satisfying then.			"

												1st person, action, adventure, shooter. In this game you play a somewhat dumbed down Indiana Jones type character with everything tied to it, in form of adventuring across beautiful landscapes in company of lovely archeologist, exploring mysterious ruins, tombs, pyramids, caves, jungles to finding long forgotten treasures, solving puzzles and battling evil Nazi and mummy / undead / zombie forces on the way, who want to stop and kill you. Game takes place in roughly 1940's Earth. You will be exploring a lot of ancient places left by old civilizations. There is some real truth and facts about places you visit in history, but most of it is legends and fantasy / sci-fi nonsense. Environments look great, not many games that have Egyptian pyramids in them, I really liked those. There are a lot of puzzles and secrets in game, and they are harder to crack on higher difficulties. There's fair amount of humor in the game. Weapon selection is pretty much WWII timeline, knife, pistols, revolvers, shotguns, rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades and rocket launchers. Character models are decent, texture quality not bad. Voice acting is decent. Character animations and control was not that amazing, but you get used to it. Personally I didn't really like how main character looks like, he had weird facial animations and didn't look good in cutscenes. Basically it's a run and gun shooter with puzzles and exploration.

												Can't say that is is a bad game, it does not give you any superior adventure experience and you will find tons of bad or annoying things in it, it's still worth to try and enjoy at least once.EDIT:After finishing teh game I can proudly say that this is a great B class game with it's pros and cons.Base pros are humorusly characters, decent puzzles and game mechanics.Base cons are horrible dialogues, animation and storytelling.As my final result will be 6.5/10P.S. Multiplayer?! Seriously?! Who demanded or made it? Not surprised it is long dead by now.			"

												There's plenty to dislike about this game:Unintuitive UI that could have you wandering around for minutes looking for the right thing to click. It's not that the puzzles are hard, but most of the challenge comes from finding the interactable object in each room that will trigger the puzzle event that's blended in with the rest of the scenery and without any indication of its importance. Combat feels uninspiring, it's an Alan Wake-style FPS that requires you to shine a flashlight at many enemy types to lower their shields before doing them in with bullets. This works in Alan Wake with its 3rd-person playstyle and dodge mechanics, but when surrounded by multiple foes, even with a broad FOV, it's very easy to get pummeled when you lose track of mummy #2 and mummy #3. There's very little damage feedback besides your vision getting blurred with a blood.png vignette, and you'll find yourself dying completely unaware that you were taking damage at all.Voice acting and cutscenes are stilted and of poor quality. I get that their localization budget was probably pretty limited, but it's not easy to immerse yourself in the lore or invest in the characters when look and sound like mannequins.However, I will say level design and the use of the Unreal Engine are both very well done. It looks very pretty while at the same time cramming in practically unlimited frames per second. You get a little of the UE-famous pop-in on some textures, mainly during cutscenes, and some mild screen tearing even with vsync.This game should be on the list of anyone who has to play every  action-puzzle game, but definitely not anyone else.

												""Welcome to Deadfall Adventures, an action adventure which seamlessly combines the first person shooter experience with puzzle-solving and exploration, taking players across the globe on a search for a rare and powerful artifact.  Developed by The Farm 51 and published by Nordic Games, Deadfall Adventures utilizes Unreal Engine 3 to produce breathtaking backgrounds and settings, but unfortunately fails to deliver on everything else.  In fact, there were times when I simply wished to put the game away and move onto something a little more stimulating, like perhaps Scrabble.  Or Clue.""Check out my full review here, at Die4Games.com! http://www.die4games.com/deadfall-adventures-review "

												A strange game, would NOT recommend it for either the combat or it's story - both are incredibly mediocre. Worst is the checkpointing which is TERRIBLE to the point of frustration. However, it's a REALLY nice looking game that makes good use of the Unreal Engine and the way they've implemented puzzles and traps into the exploration side of things works really well - though the occasional instant-death trap does not play nicely with the aformentioned bad checkpointing, as you can often find yourself repeating far too much gameplay because of an unfair pitfall or falling rock.There's enough here that I'd say it's worth a look, possibly when it drops in price a bit, if you're into Indiana Jones or Lara Croft type games. Just don't expect the same attention to story or character development - it's a REALLY perfunctory stab at the genre which throws every cliche in the book at you hoping something sticks.I give it Three Belloq's out of Five.

												This story mode seems to be slow, and repetitive. Not like some BattleField fun shooter where the enemies die realisticly. No in this one you have to waste your entire 50 pistol rounds on a zombie waste all your smg bullets and not hit when at point-blank range and then finally die and restart. The survival mode is more like a run away and hide for as long as possible, not a wave fighter like Cod Black Ops. They thought for some reason including zombies with more health then you have ammo would be a good idea. It's like putting yellow into brown and saying he'll make friends. He won't, he'll just become brown like the rest. I do not recommend this game unless you like Uncharted 100% like really annoying A.I. and repetitive gameplay.			"

												Ah...Deadfall. I love the setting, and there are some great moments, IMO. I do love the hectic mine-cart ride and some of the ruins are pretty fun to explore.  The voice-acting is bad, but in an entertaining, kind of endearing way.   The main female character serves little purpose than to b**ch at you, occasionaly shoot an enemy, and get herself kidnapped. But she's British, so that's cool I guess. It's an adventure/treasure hunting game, but also an FPS. This makes for gameplay that's a little different from the others in this genre, but unfortunately doesn't allow jumping and climbing, which is half the fun. Some of the puzzles are cool, some are annoyingly unituitive. Combat is surprisingly satisfying, when it works. Hit detection is all over the place. You can swear you're hitting an enemy with a headshot, but they're just winged. You'll be well out of arm's length, but an enemy will melee kill you in two hits, so be prepared to die a lot (or maybe I just suck) and save points are sporadic.That said, for all it's problems, I found it absorbing. I'll give it a thumbs up, but wait for a deal.3/5: Would Blind a Nazi with a Flashlight again. "

												I can only barely recommend Deadfall Adventures..and if you're thinking about getting it for Linux, you'll benefit from excessive loading times and some graphical glitches (though you can still complete the game).  Given that these have been around for most of a year, I wouldn't hold your breath in the hope that they'll be sorted soon.More generally (and I'd imagine that this would apply to the Win version too), puzzles are often weak and some can be solved quite simply by spamming switches if you're too lazy to consult the in-game game guide (i.e. the notepad).  Dialogue between characters varies between dull and cringeworthy and is not helped by the rather awful voice acting.  Combat is so so, neither types of enemy will surprise you in their tactics and weapons, whilst generally doing what you expect, are rather limited in variety. The different shotguns also seem a little on the weak side when they should be at their best (limited range / spread).Cutscene animation was like watching hover-handed people with parkinsons and often combined well with the aforementioned dialogue to make for awkward watching.  Thankfully, you can just click on ahead,Soo, why recommend?  Well the backdrops are nicely done, but more importantly, the game is just well-paced fun - an easy game you can just go back to and be pretty sure that you'll make progress without it being a complete gimme.  Probs best to get it during a sale or in a bundle as the original price is steep..and I can't guarantee you'll get your buck / hour value, but it will be an non too taxing experience that doesn't take itself too seriously.

												I have enjoyed this game quite a bit. I love the music, and the atmosphere & sceneries are rather enjoyable.Sure, very Indiana Jones-ish, but that doesn't bother me. This is a welcome change to games like CS:GO, and quite ""light"" playing experience.I got mine on discount - don't remember the price though - and have not regretted buying this.So far my only issue with this game is the fact that I can't proceed after certain part in the Ice Temple. Three particular mummies can't be unfrozen, and that's a dead-end for me - which is a shame.Looks like I'm the only one so far experiencing this issue, and I'm yet to figure out how to get past this problem.Other than that, I very much enjoyed playing Deadfall Adventures.

Im only a few hours into it but this game has far exceeded my expectation even with the few small number of glitches the game has. I wouldnt let those minor glitches deter anyone from enjoying this title especially since most people will play a AAA title with glitches. Without looking at any other reviesw I would compare this game to Uncharted and Tomb Raider, add in some mummies and take out all the platforming and quicktime events.

												My girlfriend bought me this game. I gave it the best chance I possibly could because I genuinely wanted to like the game she surprised me with. I hate it. The dialouge is out of a C movie (do they make those?). The plot is predictable. The main character seems like a tool. I just feel like this game has been done so many times before. I was hoping for something new. Here's a plus - some of the visuals were pretty slick, but that was overshadowed by the bad animations and shameful dialouge. I literally played the game on mute so she could see I put some time into playing it without having to listen to any words that came out of the character's immovable mouth. Funny thing is, it could have been great. I love the Haggard's books. I've read 4 of them about Quatermain. Quatermain is my homie. That is to say Alan Quatermain, not this unlikeable ****.			"

I got this game while it was free, and I have to admit even if this game was free it's still one of the most Sh!ttiest game out there. I only played about 7 minutes and got frustrated, so I automaticially turned it off. But then I saw there was multiplayer, so I thought it wouldn't be that bad. So I selected a skin and got started. But there was another thing wrong. The multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥!NG DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is nobody to play with and it looked bad anyways, how are you gonna do that with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ advenure game. So then I saw survival. NO PLAYERS AGAIN!!!!!!!!! So I said ♥♥♥♥ it i'm gonna try this out. So I decided to try it out, it was absolutely terrible i died extremely quick because i was out of ammo. well I don't even know why they would actually spend money on making this  sh!t. they should've donated to kids with cancer or helped people in need. i give this terrible game a -1904494354545454500000000000000000/ 10.

												So it turns out that the single-player portion of the Free Weekend was actually a demo! Which is good, because I couldn't decide whether I wanted to stop playing it altogether or see how far down the uncanny valley this poor attempt at AAA-dom went.It's actually really boring. The gunplay is bland and they stole the 'use the flashlight to kill the undead' bit from Alan Wake. There's bits where you have to use critical thinking to solve puzzles, but they were really easy to solve even after I had set the puzzle difficulty all the way up. Skill upgrades involved treasure hunts that were also really easy to solve. I'm guessing the best part was the dialogue and the voice work, both of which made me giggle madly for no apparent reason.I can't think of a good way to end this, so I've included a picture of the inventor of hip-hop.[instagram.com] "

												The game was pretty much panned by all critics. In Deadfall Adventures, I never really felt any sort of adrenaline rush from any enemy encounter. The enemies are way too bullet spongey, so it's best to set the combat to easy and save yourself some time; the combat is simply unsatisfying and dull. The AI is laughably terrible and using your flashlight to defeat mummies is no new concept. Metro Last Light used this same mechanic, but it added to the intensity of the battle, which is not the case here. The story, setting, and characters are all extremely trite. The dialogue is painfully bad, and I couldn't care less about the plot, which is sad because I was initially very excited to play a FPS that was inspired by Indiana Jones. Your female companion is often ridiculous to rely on in battle, and much of what she does seems not only poorly programmed but often glitchy.The visuals are the only impressive aspect of the experience, but the animation is very poor. I've been doing 3D modeling and animation for only 2 years and even I could have done a better job with this game's animation. It's just one more blatant problem that works against any sort of immersive experience this game intended on providing. It's a shame, because they must have had some really good artists working on the game. The only saving grace is that cutscenes are skippable. I suggest that anyone playing this game should exercise that option.As far as exploration goes, the puzzles are both frustrating and insulting to one's intelligence, though they aren't as frequent as one would expect. Some puzzles are very obvious while others are difficult for all the wrong reasons, such as knowing a solution but being unable to execute it due to bad programming or confusing hints. There are treasures to be found, but not many, and it doesn't feel like you accomplished anything in finding them. Platforming is nonexistent, as the character can't jump high enough to actually get on top of objects in the game. Even if you could, the incessant invisible walls would keep you from exploring off the extremely linear path the game forces you to follow throughout its entirety.I played this game for a few hours on another account. I really wish people wouldn't judge reviews based on the hours clocked by steam, though I understand that many users are too quick to form a negative or positive opinion of a game. This is something I have run into multiple times, especially when reviewing games that I played extensively before Steam added a system to keep track of the time spent in-game by each user. I promise I would not review a game before giving it enough of a chance to sway my opinion.I mean no offense to those who worked very hard on this game. I know it took a lot of effort and many, many people poured a lot of hopes and dreams into this project. The premise was what sold me on the game. I took a risk and preodered Deadfall Adventures. As much as I was let down, I still have faith that the developer can create a game of a higher caliber. I hope that the developers will learn from the mistakes made on this project. I wish I could say that I enjoyed Deadfall Adventures, and I could see the potential buried deep within the final product. Sadly, the potential never really surfaced. It was more like something I projected onto the game. Still, I hope they try again after learning from their mistakes.			"

												Here are a few words that came to mind while playing Deadfall: Budget, ham-fisted, awkward, forgettable, annoying, disengaging. Just.... no. Go buy Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis instead and play a bit of Farcry on the side if you really need some FPS in your adventure game.			"

												I thought i'd pitch in my two cents, since I imagine many of you may be in the same situation as I was; wanting to buy the game but discouraged by negative reviews.Well, never fear. I can tell you now that if it seems like you want this game, then you should just get it. It requires a lot of forgiving, but when it works, it's pretty amazing, and very unique - one of the highest fieldety games of this genre by a passionate developer.The Good - The combat is fun, and never ruins the pacing. There's always time to explore. The graphics are phenomenal. Some UE3 limitations pop in from time to time but the overall effect of the art design, lighting and most textures really is brilliant. And hell, the setting. Do you want to go shooting Nazi's, Commies, and Mummies? Good.The Bad - in a way, the game does deserve its negative reviews. The voice acting and animations are juuust that little bit off, but endearing in their own stupid way. The puzzles aren't really puzzles, just guessing games or connect the dots environmental obstacles. The shooting, while fun, isn't weighty enough; and the aiming is a bit sticky. And let's just say that from time to time the game breaks consistency in some very, very frustrating ways.However, i've not run into a bug, or a glitch. From a purely objective standpoint, it's technicaly proficient. And yes, I suppose it's mediocre. But I don't care, I love the ancient civilization adventure genre. And if you do too, you'll forgive this game and soak in the incredible atmosphere. Another bland shooter this is not - check out NecroVision for another shooter set in a visually intense world by the same developer.Besides, when was the last time you shot a Nazi in the face?			"

												I knew within five minutes of booting this game up that it wouldn't be a good one. The graphics are fine and the gameplay was passable; but the writing was cliched to the point of self-awareness, the voice acting was abysmal and the animation was somehow even worse than that. At best the game would have slipped by as harmless and charmingly stupid.I've made it somewhere between halfway through and the 2/3rds mark and I no longer find it charming.This game is dumb. Very, very dumb. Putting aside little technical bugs like the compass randomly glitching out and hovering in midair, the gameplay and controls are just sloppy. The FPS elements are harmless enough, you point your gun at the Nazis and the Nazis fall down. It's not especially engaging but it breaks up the puzzle-solving well enough I guess. The puzzles have two settings, irrespective of difficulty: insultingly obvious or impossible to guess. That is to say there IS no puzzle, it's just a stylized code lock with the answer written in your grandfather's all-knowing notebook. The different puzzle difficulty levels seem to only change how hard it is to read his handwriting.To give some very mild spoilers, the point where I lost interest in this game is the start of the Arctic Mines level. It started when after the Sudden But Inevitable betrayal, I'm suddenly in a firefight with Russians of all things. And our 'intrepid heroes' start spitting out the word ""commie"" like it's five years into the Cold War when up to now we've been fighting the freaking Nazis! If anything, the protagonists actually seemed to think the communists were WORSE, since they were fairly civil when they got pushed into solving puzzles for the Nazis at gunpoint but couldn't go two sentences speaking to the Russians without resorting to namecalling. It was bizarre, like one of the devs bumped into someone working on Call of Duty in the hallway and they got their notes mixed up for a few pages. Complete with an out of nowhere QTE escape sequence at the beginning of the level. If that's the case, I look forward to the inexplicable sliding block puzzle in the next CoD game.That said, it wasn't this idiotic story swerve that made me throw the game in the bin. No, that came a few minutes later when, as I abandoned a terribly-designed platforming sequence in digust, pulled on a lever and was immediately shoved into a cutscene that pulled me past a point of no return (which the game is lousy with) AND autosaved at the exact same moment, making it impossible to backpedal without restarting the level entirely.That was the proverbial straw. I'm done with this nonsense, the game was only getting by on C-list SyFy doofy charm to begin with - giggling at as its Indiana Jones-by-way-of-noir-PI protagonist, his designated love interest by virtue of bust size and open disgust trying to sound like sexual tension, the dialog that sounds like a ten-year-old trying to be clever - and that's stopped being cute. Don't bother with this inept piece of trash.			"

												Deadfall Adventures may be clunky in places, but it has a heart that’s firmly in the right place. It’s the kind of game that we wish we didn’t have to stick a score to coming from a small studio it was never going to be able to compete with the likes of Tomb Raider and Uncharted. Yet with a decent selection of puzzles and a desire to do things slightly differently, The Farm 51 have managed to make something with the elusive sense of adventure that some developers forget to include.

It´s a game about Quartermaine, really similar to Indiana Jonesand all that. I´ve been waiting for a game like this one, because I really likeall those adventure stuff movies, the characters and the overall style.I played some hours now and I think the game is worth playing for me.Contains all the things needed, it´s fun to play, nice looking and easy.I´d recommend it for the player, that just want´s to have some hours ofentertainment. Nothing more, but nothing less, I´d say it´s a 6 out of 10. You´ll get puzzles, riddles, Nazis, Russians, Mummies & easy shooting ...Don´t expect too much, but if you´re a fan of Indiana Jones - buy it.Delorean  "

												This game *is* a bit overpriced for what it is, but it's a very good game. I got it though a humble bundle deal and got like 95% off, which is well worth it.You can basically boil this game to a lower budget Uncharted with basic FPS combat circa the late 90s, some good and sometimes involved puzzles that are varied enough to keep you interested, and a lot of content for a game in this specific genre. The main thing that will make you notice the low budget is the mediocre and sometimes downright awful voice acting and script, not to mention the two generation old animations and models.That said, it's a fun game that *is* worth some money, I would just wait until it's on sale for $15-20 like it probably will be again during the holidays. If you like shooters with some exploration and adventure, this is one of the better, allbeit dated, ones that is currently on Steam.			"

												I have to agree with the vast majority of reviews the voice acting is just awful, like nails on a chalkboard, I want to rip my own eardrums out awful.  I would pay more to unhear the voice acting than I did for the game.The game itself is not too bad, if you liked painkiller then i would say you'd enjoy this, if only it wasn't for the bugs. I've had to restart the game three times to beat a puzzle. I knew I had the solution correct as it was pretty simple but the game wouldn't recognise this until the third restart.The gameplay was acceptable bt does get very repetitive (much like painkiller) and by the time i had made my way through half of the game I felt I was just going through the motions and got bored quickly.

												OMG! Yes, yes, yes. I am filled with excitement and i want more of this game. I wish it were longer. Playing this game reminds me of the times when adventure was the status qoe. I highly recommend this game for thrill seeker 1st person shooters in the likes of the Tomb Raider and the Uncharted series. Compelling story, great sound in 5.1 surround sound. And you get to take on an endless horde of nazi villanoeous scum. I want more, more, more. In the like of games that got me hooked with good story telling and snap epic action along with great graphics. It just really takes you there to the place that we all lived within the Raider of the Lost Ark. Solving puzzles that are not too hard and finding treasures along the way makes this game epic. Please play this game. I promise you will not regret it. It made me want to watch the Indiana Jones Adventure series all over again. I live for the cinimatics. Thanks for bringing back what an adventure is all about! I'm hooked in Deadfall...Take THAT nazi villian scum...you'll never succeed when James Lee Quartermane is there!			"

												This is a game that wants to be Indianna Jones mixed with some other great adventure stories.Unfortunately instead of Raiders of the Lost Ark we end up with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.Well maybe that is a little unfair. This game isn't awful, it isn't broken it isn't buggy and it can be fun. Certainly the game can be gorgeous at times and the art direction should be applauded.The weapon selection is limited but is somewhat unique in the fact that they include some real life hidden gems (federov anyone?!?...love it!)The main problem is that the game feels like it could have come out in 1999 the levels, while pretty feel like shooting galleries only broken up by boring puzzle sections (don't get me wrong I don't mind puzzles but these are just particularly bad ones).Enemy AI is also pretty dumb but serves the purpose of moving the game forwards. The story is also pretty hammy but does a good job.The one part that really ruined this game for me though is the voice acting. It is amongst the worst i've seen in almost 3 decades of gaming. It is as if the actors weren't in the same room when they recorded dialogue and more than that like they just pulled people off of the street to do the voices....words cannot describe how bad it is, especially the female lead!In any case i'd recommend this for a lazy weekend if you could pick it up for under $5 and maybe even for under $10. It's not bad and you can have fun with it, look past the voice acting and creaky level design and there is some decent tongue in cheek action it's just a shame as it could have been so much more. Instead it just grinds to an average middle ground.5/10			"

I have tryed again after and that worked finally to the end of the history with a final master like pokemon boss, it's very depressing to think about that game like this, but just like the fun, something not have accepted the curiosity and has tryed something more, just like the end of the history in the game, just like I'm saying to tell you that!

												I was really hyped for this game but then I end up being disappointed. Despite the good graphics, the story is very exhausting and repetitive. Your partner gets kidnapped, you save her then gets kidnapped again. Basically, the story revolves around this circular plot. The combat system is a total rip-off of the Call of Duty series - the 2 weapon system, the car chase (although in this game, it's a mine cart chase), and the way the human enemies fight you. The only enemies I enjoyed are the mummies. They were challeging and sometimes a pain in the butt. The puzzles were decent and challenging. Although, for a game with an exploration theme, the exploration factor is really limited. You just rely on your compass to find treasures and your grandfather's notebook for the clues in the puzzles. You don't have to explore the tombs for clues or whatsoever. The game was linear, repetitive, and overall, claustrophobic. Don't buy unless it's on sale.			"

												Deadfall Adventures is an all-around average game, which could have made better use of the Quatermain setting, and is dragged down by some design issues. The mixture of shooting and puzzling are certainly pleasant, but are they enough to justify the $39.99 price tag?  If you’re looking for a satisfying single player FPS, there might be better games out there.  Would-be explorers better wait for a price drop or a hefty discount before embarking on this particular adventure.

												I felt the need to write a review for this game as the critics gave it quite a severe hammering on release and I wanted to put a few things right. First, I'll get the negative points out of the way. The game won't win any awards for originality, the story is pretty run of the mill, the combat mechanics are a little clumsy and the voice acting ranges from average to comical. To be honest though if anything these enhance the fun I've had with the game as I figured right from the start that it doesn't take itself too seriously.You play as wisecracking adventurer James Quartermain hired to find a powerful artifact sought after by the Nazis. Sound familiar? Yes, it bears many resemblances to the Indiana Jones movies. It's primarily a first person shooter but with puzzle elements which might not be the most smartly designed and occasionally border on stupid but again, that's half the fun. The locations range from hostile looking temples through Arctic wastelands right through to lush Jungles and ancient cities. The game looks fairly pretty in most places and it all runs very smoothly with no lag or fps drops to be found. There are one or two glitches and some occasional pop in on loading but that's it really. It certainly isn't the buggy mess that some critics would have you believe.One of the main additions to the game is the constant hunt for treasures which act as stat boosters if you find enough. These will enhance things like your health, rate of fire, reload speed etc and while they don't appear to make a significant difference it is however quite fun to hunt some of these down.Obviously being a first person shooter the main selling point for many will be the gunplay. As mentioned, this can be fairly clumsy and the aiming feels like it's on some kind of grid if that makes any sense. It doesn't really take much getting used to and it certainly doesn't ruin the game. As I said, this is a pure old style game which takes me back to when first person games were enjoyable and Deadfall Adventures doesn't try to be anything other than a good fun game. I can't comment on the multiplayer aspect though as I simply have zero interest in multiplayer or online games. I have had a lot of enjoyment out of the single player campaign however, and while it's probably not worth full price I would urge anyone to give it a go if it's on sale.Deadfall Adventures is far from original and it might not be the most polished game but it's still a very enjoyable shooter. If you have any interest in Indiana Jones or the Uncharted games then I'm sure you'll find something you like here. Critics were overly harsh on this in my opinion. Then again if it's not Call Of Duty or Fifa most critics don't seem to want to know these days anyway. I think there's a lot to like here. Sure, it's flawed but at the end of the day it's good old fashioned fun. Something most modern games overlook in my opinion. Give it a try. You may just be surprised.			"

												It's a bit cheesy but definitely an awesome single player fps adventure game. This one is a real throwback to early tromb raider or wolfenstein games. Nasty nazis, occult baddies and a plethora of groanworthy commentary from the hero. What isn't to love? The engine runs smoothly and the level design is really well done. Give it a go! Unless you have no soul and want all your games AAA polished you'll probably enjoy it in some way:)			"

												Avoid at all costs. I picked this up for a few bucks and boy was that a mistake. Boring, bland, bad controls, sub par graphics (guess it was made by a small team). It's trying to combine puzzle solving and FPS shooting and it doesn't do a very good job of it.			"

												A very mediocre shooter in every sense of the word. The graphics are good, the shooting mechanics are solid, enemies die with good impact and animation. You visit different exotic locales. There's a sense of indiana jones and drake's uncharted. Then there's the problems. You use the same boring 3 different types of machine guns, 1 rifle, 1 sniper, and 2 shotguns, and that's it. You never find anything new and have seen all the weapons half way through the game. You fight the same 2 enemies, regular guys and zombies which you need to use flashlight to kill, which can be very finnicky. Every temple feels and looks the same, so you only really feel you visit like 3 environments total. The upgrades tree is super boring and is just ""more health, more stamina, less recoil"". The story gets confusing and boring quickly, and doesn't have much intrigue or captivating material. The voice acting is horrendous, as well as the facial and body animations. The pacing is bad. You go through 1 fight, then solve like 2 puzzles in a row, then 2 fights, then solve a puzzle, and so on. There's so many puzzles that it gets tiresome and annoying. Most of them either don't make sense or involve you just looking in your notepad and doing what it says. Game length is decent. Multiplayer is dead. In the end its repetitive and not great, but the mechanics are solid and there's worse options out there. 7/10.			"

												Don't go into this game expecting big budget quality - This is an inexpensive game that, If I'm not mistaken, was origionaly released on consoles.The Keyboard & Mouse Controls work without fault and you have the option of using a gamepad, The Xbox 360 Game pad was supported out of the box.Graphics are of a high enough quality is determine exactly what you are looking at, If it is of some importance - The weapons have higher detail then the stone walls of the temples for example.I have read some reviews complaining about the audio - the audio is servicable if unspectacular. The weapons, while lacking audio impact, are distinct enough that you can guess what weapon is being used by sound alone with a little practice.I purchased the game while it was on special for $5.00 USD and got about 10 hours out of it, that fits my idea of value for money at approx $1 per hour of entainment (Worked out to be about $7.00 AUD)TL;DRControls Work.Decent Graphics.Decent Audio.Not worth full price.Is worth up to $10.

												This is one of those games I REALLY wanted to be good. God knows gaming needs a proper, indiana jones-style adventure fps.Alas, ridiculous voice acting, idiotic puzzles that hold your hand, and clumsy controls just drag it down.Great locations, though.ONLY buy if you are completely starved for adventure, or are an absolute sucker for 80s style adventure movies			"

												If you're a fan of pulp adventures than give this a game a try - however it lacks any stand out features and apart from the lush graphics is fairly bland. I enjoyed James and Jen's banter, and it felt like it had some heart to it. However the combat is extremely simple - it's never offensively bad, although supernatural enemies require you shining your torch on them which makes fighting them a bit more dull compared to the human enemies. The guns, WW2-era, are fun to shoot and fighting enemies feels satisfying, which since there's a lot of fighting is a good thing at least. The Puzzles are very simple, although a few aren't very clear and require a bit of trail and error. Finding artifacts is relatively fun, but they're incredibly simple and don't really require you going out of your way. The graphics are gorgeous though, thanks to the strong art style. Egypt looks like it came straight out of a Indiana Jones movie, and looks fantastic.The story is typical of a classic adventure, taking you to 3 seperate locations around the world. The characters don't have much backdrop, but the main character James is a classic smart♥♥♥♥♥and some of his comments made me chuckle. Jen's a decent companion and despite getting captured a few times didn't strike me as a bad character, just a tad underdeveloped.It's a very safe game, which although I enjoyed the full price tag is too much for what it's offering. I also encountered numerous bugs, including Jen not following me at times (however this didn't stop progress) If we see any more adventures from James than hopefully they'll introduce more mechanics and deeper gameplay, since as it is now it's barely skin-deep.To sum it up, if you can afford the price tag and are more interested in a fun if slightly shallow adventure, than definitely give Deadfall a go. It lasted me about 8 hours, which as far as modern FPS campaigns go is fairly long. If you're more into deep gameplay and intricate puzzles than you would be better off elsewhere.			"

												This game has a lot of cool Ideas but the execution is just lacking in too many ways to make it worthwhile.The Good:The premise is pretty sweet. You are a descendant from Alain Quartermain in what is a story heavily inspired by Indiana Jones. Which is a very nice Idea. It's not the imaginative of stories but it works.The overall look of the game is also quite good. Bright desert, moody lighted tombs, blinding sunlight in the frozen glaciers...Voice acting for germans actually made by german native speakers. Yes! So many really big games and movies fail at this. Big tumbs up!The Journal, helping you with the puzzling. You don't need it but it gives hints.The Bad:Combat is mediocre at best, usually ending in ""wait for enemy to pop up and then shoot him in the face"" or ""point flashlight at mummy then shoot it in the face"".Voice acting. The effort is appreciated but Quartermain comes through as a chauvinistic loudmouth instead of the laid-back adventurer he's supposed to be.Puzzles are so-so, none of them are complex or challenging but some are frustrating because you have to wait for ages until an object finally moves into position or until you have finally turned that statue 180 degrees.The scripting of the action Cutscenes isn't too bad but they just look so... awkward. And sometimes they just don't make sense. Quartermain jumps on a hook, slides through a tunnel, onto another hook, out the other side of the tunnel.. and his companions stand right beside him. Huh?Consolified controls. Keys are rebindeable (and there's a FOV slider~) but the controls still are very console-y in the way they are laid out.Textures are pretty bad. Rocks tend to be a grey smudge, snow is just a white mess.. meh. Not too distracting but it just looks unfinished.Also the animations on the AI look ... strange. And some sounds are disconnected from the motions. While cycling the K98k the sound plays a much faster bolt-action sound than the model shows..The Ugly:Leveldesign. It seems very rushed. Sometimes you can jump on boxes, sometimes you can't. Some places just outright kill you without the slightest warning setting you back to the last checkpoint and force you to go through the motions of another deadly trap.The game itself presses exploration, stating exploration is key for this game, go explore and find treasure. (As it should be!) But then you are running into invisible walls everywhere. Boxes that you clearly should be able to effortlessly step on are insurmountable barriers all of a sudden. Some rooms that are difficult to find are just empty. What the hell?This game just didn't know what it wanted to be. Action-Adventure? FPS? Puzzle-Game?In the end, it tries to serve too many masters and fails. And it feels very rushed and unfinished, to boot.I can only recommend this on a sale and not full price. (Got it from a humble bundle so there it's alright)			"

												If you like Indiana jones you will like this game, if you like shooter-games you will like this game aswell, even if you like puzzles...you will love it. this game has everything needed to achieve attention this year.Deadfall adventures has everything needed to entertain the people playing the game, awesome graphics, hard puzzles and action lots of action.I bought it for 2,50euro and tbh... in my world games like this one are worth 50euro +.Its an amazing experience, lots of fun and adventure. as i said above, if you like Indiana jones and the story behind that movie you will LOVE this game :) Try it and enjoy, it costs nothing right now but its worth so much----------------------Graphics : 8 / 10Story : 7.5 / 10Gameplay : 10 / 10Puzzles : 8 / 10 Shooter-Elements : 10 / 10Overall : 9,5 / 10----------------------Have fun playing!LordSabops: If you want a challenge dont play it on normal, in this game normal feels like easy in other games, will play it again on the hardest difficulty and see how it goes :D ( you can change difficulty for the puzzles and for the shooting separately )			"

												RECOMMENDED.Great First Person Adventure Game.Huge scenarios with amazing art. Solid story and long enough.It has that adventure sensation you can feel in Indy's films.Lots of puzzles, most of time, very affordable.What I didn't like:Colisions system should be polished, you could be stupidly trapped from time to time, between two objects that seem far enough.There are lots of areas where you should be able to climb or cross by jumping but, there are those phantom walls that avoid it.Some life in scenarios is missing (animals, anything...).Checkpoints. Where will we be able to save whenever we want?.But, none of those ruins the playability or the interest of this game. Think on a mix of Indiana Jones and Thomb Raider but, in First Person and, without the hell of auto-cameras and, without that platform component. Traps, puzzles, original fighting with the searchlight, compass, ...I've really enjoyed it.			"

												Not impressed.  I picked this up for £3.29 and wish I hadn't.  72 minutes in and I've been able to get stuck on objects three times now.   The game touts exploration but I fear to explore as if I do I tend to get perma-stuck on objects.  With no quicksave function I'm forced to go back and repeat the same ""puzzles"" again due to no fault of my own.  The game simply isn't good enough for me to waste my time repeating myself.Story is awful, graphics, said to be good, are not and it's a slow sluggish affair.  No atmosphere.If I'm uninstalling after wasting £3.29 on this after 72 mins I can only imagine the frustration felt by folk who paid an eye watering £32.99 for this disaster :)			"

												This game is very buggy. From the very first mission I had puzzle bugs and so on. Weird clipping and stupid AI. The concept of taking out the mummies with the flashlight and holding a beam on them then shooting is highly stupid. I also have to say that as simple as some things are they're not very well put, rather the notofication of such things is poorly implemented. Had to google certain aspects. I would not recommend this game to anyone. It started off fun for the first bit and then after you have to deal with all the bull and stupidity going on because of the coding (bugs, AI, etc.) I just couldn't handle the irritation of it. Even so, I give this game a 4/10, I was nice because of the♥♥♥♥♥focus early on.			"

												Easy to get motion sickness, changing FoV doesn't really help when he gets back at original FoV when zooming in to shoot.I usually like the story in these kind of games, and that's why I stick with them, but I cannot get annoyed over some things here:- These ancient ruins need to be solved by clearing ""elaborate puzzles"" where you need your grandfather's notes for. The nazi's, however, don't give a single f*ck, and although you always leave those puzzles in a ""finished"" state, they somehow always completed it, reset it and made it all ready for you to continue- Some notes from the grandfather are also a tad ridiculous - there's a nazi camp in the artic, which could be fun. but your grandfather - which you assume came here xx years ago - has made a fancy little sketch of the current nazi camp. Nice graphics, atmosphere fails a bit, it's basically shoot nazis (or commies, which are a reskin for 1 level) or mummies (which use an 'advanced' mechanic), solve an easy 'ancient' puzzle to get to a place no one has ever been before (except for the nazi army you're chasing).I would have forgiven all of that and played through, if I could finish the game without getting motionsick and having to quit after half an hour or so. I do not recommend, 4/10. Maybe if you like exploring the same ruins with a different reskin and shooting stuff, without second thought, it'd be something for you			"

												Deadfall Adventures has alot of potentional if your a fan of Indiana Jones and Action FPS, to start this game will give you beautiful scenery on the latest Unreal engine its just amazing, The weapons and your flashlight powers are amazing too the weapons are so detailed like they were back in 1930's (Where the game is set) the game is just full of realism and fun at the same time including its multiplayer but the lack of custmization on loadouts and weapons. I would recommend this to any gamer since its a good game and probably worth the money. 9/10			"

												It's not without its charm, but it's a rather average game. It's the video game equivalent of watching a cheesy Indiana Jones imitation movie (e.g King Solomon's Mines, The Mummy movies) when you could be watching Indiana Jones instead, or in this case playing Tomb Raider or Uncharted. It's a fun game, but kind of forgettable. Incidentally, the voice acting is kind of ""meh"".			"

YouTube™ Video: Deadfall Adventures video review - middle of the road gaming 

			Views: 542		

			http://cramgaming.com - A look at Nordic Games/ Farm 51's action first person adventure Deadfall Adventures, which is available now on console and PC platforms.		

Deadfall Adventures review:Deadfall Adventures tells a fairly tame story with larger than life characters and many moments where the action heats up with some cool scripted scenes. The puzzle element is welcome, but in some instances really hinders the pacing of the game. Sadly, the game's characters are simply not likable enough to step beyond being generic, and as a result the story aspect of the game is largely inconsequential. So, what you're left with is a fairly competent shooter, that cleverly mixes in puzzles, throws in some multiplayer and co-op and wraps it up in a neat package that plays pretty well. However, there's simply something lacking from the game in every department, that borders on being dull and uninspiring. As a result, Deadfall Adventures doesn't reinvent the wheel, or tries to, and merely offers a mediocre but pleasant action adventure, that's worth a play but is not necessarily an essential purchase, and certainly not up to par with its peers in terms of quality. If you like a bit of puzzle solving, shooting Nazis and are bored of military shooters, then Deadfall Adventures is perhaps worth checking out, although perhaps it would be prudent to wait for an inevitable price drop.Score 7/10 - Review by Robert Cram			"

												Well, il start by saying that it was a pleasant surprise to play this game, if you are a fan of the movies of Quartmain adventures, you sure feel inside one of his adventures, the game have a decent combat mechanic and very well made puzzles wich give you the sense of adventurer looking for loot, just like Quartemain.All the diferent scenarios give you the feeling you are travelling around the world, even not using a top engine, the graphics are good and make the enviorement more believable, some animations are fun others a little dumb, but doesnt get in the way of the gameplay.There are some variaty of old model weapons, they feel satisfying when firing them but the little ammo you can carry for each one may feel frustrating in some fights, also they have pretty good sound if that matter for any of you.The Loot incentivate the exploration to get skill points to improve your character and weapons handling, but the levels are very linear, there is 2 or 3 ocasions here you have a little more freedom but, this is a linear game at is core.The Survival mode is very good to play alone or with friends wich give a more extense to the gameplay, or if you are more of a competitive player, the multiplayer is also satisfying with some fun modes you dont find in other games, but in that regard you have better options for the classic modes.Conclusion, it is fresh experience from what we have in the market about shooters, with the adventure touch that make Deadfall a diferent game from the others, and if you fan of QT adventures, you surely feel the similarity betwen them, so id give it a try.

												Enjoyed the demo, may have to increase the difficulty as I only got killed by the traps and not the nazi's. Felt like finding all the treasure locations was the most difficult part of the game when combat probably should be (assuming it gets harder as you play). Voice acting wasn't all that impressive, but the story was one I found myself wanting more of. Pathfinding was a the only real glitch I found, my companion got stuck a few times so she couldn't follow me. Middle of the road FPS but interesting none the less. Not sure I would pay full price, but at 50% off it's definitely worth the buy.			"

												This game is everything that it set out to be: a raw, ridiculous good time. The word ""thrillride"" would be an apt cliche, but it's not quite that, either. Honestly, it's quite boring and repetitive at times, but high points more than pay their dues.  It's got Indiana Jones-style temples, The Mummy-style gunfights, Nazis, Ruskies, mummies, a mine-cart level (because of course there's a minecart level... with lava!) and the ancient curse of Huziwatsisface. If you think these things are good things, you owe it to yourself to play this game and fight your way through the lack of polish, the formulaic puzzles, repetitive fights, and (mostly intentional) cheesy characters.It's not going to win any awards, but god bless them for making this game.

												i found this game to be very fun and interesting. The stroy is decent 6/10. Graphics by 2013 standards are visually good 7.5/10, with just a few slopy animations here and there. But now the puzzles, they are a good blend of thinking out of the box and at the same time common sense and guess work. give the puzzles 8/10. Combat is fun and i admit to being scared by a random zombie head full size on screen. I'd give it 8/10.Unfortunately, the multiplayer is dead though. :/.  Set on hard all around the puzzles can b very tough but, for the experienced gamers, combat remains semi-easy. Altogether i loved this game but i my opinion, get it on sale if u can cause $40 is a little steep for this game.			"

												If you grew up with treasure finding adventure games then you will like this old school adventure game with a blend of Indiana Jones, Uncharted, and Tomb Raider.  The game is built on an older engine and the graphics are a little dated, but it is a fun story and some interesting puzzles.  Whats not to like about racing against some nazis trying to find some occult power to use in thier quest for world domination?  Its all first person with some good combat to break up the exploring and puzzle solving.  Is a fun playthrough with anywhere between 6 and 12 hours of play depending on how fast you can solve the puzzles and how much time you spend looking for treasure.			"

												Really quality game.Its everything you ahve ever wanted. Imagine you as Indiana Jones shooting Nazis and mummies inside a pyramid. Thats the game in a nutshell.Overall good and graphics are amazing. Sometimes its just weird and stupidly unrealistic, but in a good way.Combat is like Alan Wake, but in first person. You can burn enemies with flashlight. Yes, such realistic thing :P5/5 must buy for everyone. Everyone. Deluxe is not worth the money tho. Nothing too special in it.			"

												I don't play this too long but I can say it's a good game. Nice graphic and exploring are the best. On every level we can find many treasures and sometimes it's not so easy .. The most helpful are maps which can be found on our way but these maps are a bit hard to read. We must be very careful if we really want to find all of the treasures. Anyway these treasures can help us to improve our skills so we should find them. The next thing I like is soundtrack, it's quiet nice, not as good as in Indiana Jones but it's good :) Now the things I don't like .. The levels (especially outside) are closed, even if it's easy to jump somewhere, we can't do it. Game doesn't let us to go or jump where we want, it's the most dissappointing. Next funny thing is that we can hear voice of our friend even if she is so far from us and the dialog is repeated after 10 seconds again and again. The rest seems to be nice but I must play longer to know that. Anyway, I recommend Deadfall Adventures and I think that 7,5/10 is a good rate.			"

												Take FPS, Adventure and Pulp genre... if you like at least 2 out of 3 than yes it's worth buying. Each of the elements isn't too impressive but the sum total is very much fun (aside from a few hugely irritating sequences ;) ) Yes the story is cliche, dialog cheesy, characters shallow... What did you expect? it's a pulp game, Yes FPS gameplay is derivative and puzzles while rather fun in themselves don't usually make any sense in the context of the world.The bottom line: pulp game are rare... FPS/adventure hybrids are rare... and this one is very much enjoyableP.S. a word of warning though, take a look at my play time - that's a finished game with taking time to explore and find most of collectibles and considerable time lost on special ""die-reload check point-repeat"" action sequences.  Basically the game is fairly short, so if you want more value for you money you might want to wait for a sale.			"

												This game is an homage to movies like indiana jones and the mummy. You play as James Lee Quatermain who is the son of Allan Quatermain. The Allan Quatermain books were one of the inspirations for indiana jones and are now in the public domain. The gameplay is fun, you shoot mummies and nazis. Pistols are dual wielded. Th puzzles aren't too difficult and it has that B-Movie kind of charm.Overall I really liked it			"

												My score is 80. The critics low rated this game but I do not agree.    I liked the many puzzles, and there was usually a way to think your way through a boss fight rather than just run and gun.  The game is a little simplistic and the Normal play level is more like Easy for other shooters.   If you are experienced the higher levels will be a lot more fun.			"

												Man, this game is beautiful. Deadfall Adventures has the setting and story of Indiana Jones, the style of Uncharted and the gameplay of... a generic first person shooter. You play this game from a first person perspective which is actually a very nice twist on the genre. You'll be traveling to different parts of the world to find hidden treasures, solve puzzles and chase bad guys.Like I said, the game has the vibe of Indiana Jones. It all looks very colorful and very adventurous. It has awesome, detailed graphics and horrible, horrible voice acting. A damn shame, because the rest of the game is actually worthwhile, but the voice acting is one of the things that drags the game down. The other thing that drags the game down are the firefights. It's inaccurate and doesn't feel realistic. It's important, because near the end you'll be fighting off more and more enemies.The story is fun in that it doesn't take itself all that seriously. It will be fun as long as you keep that in mind.There are also loads of treasures to be found; some can be found in the open, some are hidden and can be found by simply exploring and some can be collected by solving puzzles. These puzzles are usually simple to solve and can be completed in just a few minutes. If some of these puzzles were only a bit harder it would've given you a better feeling of accomplishment.Doesn't take away the fact that it's fun to try and find these treasures. Treasures can also be used to upgrade your character, but I didn't notice much a difference when I first started the game and when I finished the game. He still felt the same to me.Checkpoints are sometimes awkwardly placed so if you die while trying to solve a second or third puzzle you might have to start all over from the beginning. This can be frustrating but usually it's just a couple of minutes. Still... annoying.Deadfall Adventures wants to be a first person Uncharted and in a way The Farm 51 has succeeded in doing this. Next time, keep the graphics, improve the voice acting and shooting aspects, make the puzzles (a bit) harder and you'll probably have a great, fun sequel in your hands.			"

												This game is very sloppy in it's execution, but the backgrounds and setting are amazing and the lead characters are quirky and interesting.  The puzzles in the game are challenging, but you carry around a little notepad should you run into trouble that has the answers on it.The firefights are pretty good with puzzles and exploration in between.  I really like that the game rewards you for rooting around looking for treasure, but doesn't just give you the treasure once you find it -- hiding it behind a puzzle to make you work for it.			"

There is nothing here that hasn't already been done before but it blends all the elements together for an action packed experience that isn't afraid to tax your grey matter either.

												Tried the free weekend trial. Puzzle game with some FPS action. Graphics are pretty decent and run smoothly, but the title animations and first part of the in-game movie are choppy and hard, even when the video settings are way down. Other than that, game is okay - puzzles in the first part of the story weren't as complicated as I would have liked and you get a little bit of killing action, which satified me enough. Not a lot of treasures (but maybe that's by design). I think I'd recommend it.			"

It's not the most challenging game around, but it has a really nice storyline and breathtaking scenery. "

												Pros:Great pacingGreat (50/50) mix of puzzle solving and combat very well spaced outSolid gunplayCool exotic locationsCons:Hilariously bad voice acting and dialogueCliche storyPoor animations during cutscenesNo manual saves only chackpoint saves (albeit the checkpoint are very well spaced)Deadfall adventures is a FPS/Action Adventure/Puzzle hybrid and it combines and mixes up these elements extremely well to keep the game from falling in a rut.  It's essentially an Indiana Jones type adventure, complete with many familiar tropes, and the story is extremely cliche and predictable.  However it does give you an excuse to visit several of really cool looking exotic locations.The gunplay is solid with the weapons feeling quite different from each other and the weapons that should pack a punch feeling appropriately meaty.  The game even occassionally gives you a fun toy like a MG 34 to play with for a short while. Puzzles aren't overly challenging, even on hard difficulty (you can set combat and puzzle difficulty seperately), but a few of them will at least make you think for a bit.  Most puzzles are thinking puzzles, though there are a scant few that rely on quick reflexes.Overall it's a very fun game if you're looking for an Indiana Jones-esque adventure and can get past subpar production values.

												Personally, I am about 3/4 through the game, and I am really having fun.  I have played tons of FPS games, and this one is unique in many ways.  It's open world, yet you are being led toward an end.  The enemies can be tough, but if you use your flashight and objects in the environment you'll survive.  All the criticism I read, there is some truth in it. Are the weapons old?  Yes... but the game takes place in like the 1930's. Is the flashlight trick kinda dumb?  Yeah, but it's over the top funny, cause it works on humans, too. Is the dialogue fillled with cheesy cynical one-liners? Sure.  But I think they are funny, just like in Duke Nuklem, Deadpool, etc.  My only problem with the game is that even though my rig will chew through graphics on Crysis, Witcher 2, etc. this game gave me lag.  On a 1920x1080 res I tried everything, finally turning AA off did it.  It must be the way they rendered it, I just played Wolfenstien New Order and had it set at 8x I think.  Anyway I would reccomend buying on sale, but not for full price.			"

The game isn't so special, so I will wait for lower price and maybe 75% or more discount, but I will buy it for sure. I give it 7/10.			"

												This game is not that bad. Its just a nice first person shooter that takes place in the time of Indiana Jones and Rick O'Connell (who is from the Mummy movie series) . I wish there were some servers so i can play multiplayer aginst other players. i think this game earns a 8/10 rating			"

												This is actually quite fun, as the weaponry is very realistic and the mechanics are mostly fresh and challenging.  Some areas are overly difficult to complete without a little hair-pulling frustration, but that only has minor impact on the quality of the game.  If this is the type of game you like, it's worth trying.			"

												Deadfall Adventures is somekind of a mix between Uncharted, Tomb Raider and of course, Indiana Jones. A piece of warning though... this is a true BUDGET TITLE, so I tried to keep that in mind even though, the game falters in so many ways but somehow, I still wanted to keep going and finish the storymode.The story is very cliché from Indiana Jones, The Mummy, Uncharted, Tomb Raider, all mixed together. The game involves the player into finding some major artifact but unfortunately, it was split into three parts and guess what, you have to search from them until the very end, where you realize that it was all for nothing.The gameplay is lacking. Linear corridors after many invisible ways and glitches aside, the exploration aspect is as rotting as the mummy rot!I'll put the good and bad aspects so you can have a better preview of the overall game.PROS:+Visuals can be good at times but not the characters though.+Diverse geographical locations.+Pretty lenghty for a FPS game.+Weapons variety.+Collectibles found are used in upgrading your skills divided into three categories.+Soundtrack is quite average but does the job for a budget title.CONS:-Poor retelling of a story we've heard countless times before.-Repetitive combat.-Level design in this game is really bad. It's filled with glitches and invisible walls.-Boring puzzles.-Laughably bad voice acting.-Dead or non-existent multiplayer.RECOMMENDATION:Honestly, I'm sure the developers tried their best to make a fun exploratory treasure hunt game but it failed on so many aspects that I find this hard to recommend. The game is lenghty and you do have a few collectibles to find around but beside that, once you do finish the main story mode, there isn't much else to do. The multiplayer portion is like a ghost town although, someone wouldn't had bought this game for the MP! At 39.99$, I truly CANNOT recommend this game for all its CONS but if you can manage to get it around 10$ or less, you may want to give it a shot!The best recommendation I can give you though is to stick with Tomb Raider and Uncharted games. They deliver the stories more professionally and are more enjoyable in the gameplay category.PS. I can't find much of a reason to recommend you the Deluxe Edition as the goodies included can't justify the price, IN MY OPINION! You do get the soundtrack with it and if you're a soundtrack sucker, then get the Deluxe!RATING:6.0 / 10			"

												This game takes all the best of other adventure games and has put it together. The problem is that the game has not 1 thing in which it is outstanding. It is just a mix of all things which is good in other games. I experienced Tomb Raider, Uncharted, Indiana Jones, but also characters which were made on base of real life personalities. I saw the complete storyline of Indiana Jones (one of my favorite games): Jones & Sophia Hapgood which were in complete fight with the nazi's. If you look to the story of the last indy game you will see a complete copy of the story, locations, objects and loading screens, interventions by the nazi's, etc. It also contains elements of puzzle/platform games. It contains so so so much that i cannot get amused by this game. It also uses leveling of your character in multiplayer which does not attract me. The only thing i like in the multiplayer is the way the game is played. There are a lot of extra's in the environment (like shoot at circles to activate elements, for example activate an oven where the enemy is standing on) which makes it amusing to play. On scale of 6 the single player would get a 6 minus and the multiplayer an 8.			"

Defo worth the wait in hope the price drops. Not sure i want to pay the full wak on this game. Brings a kind of indiana jones and a bit of castle ramstein. The nazis trying to beat you to the jewls in a way at the same time as becoming the almighty of some sort. Again very Castle Ramstein in an indiana jones outfit. I want to play the rest of this game, when and if the price drops. so Thumbs up.			"

												MILD SPOILERS ALERT My review might be biased some what. The reason why, is that I love Indiana Jones movies and for a game that some what recreate that experience for me to live it is utterly SPECTACUILAR. The GOOD: The game is beautiful, its not the best graphics but still amazing to look at. I loved how you have a book in your hand which shows you how to tackle puzzle but not make it like a piece of cake for you. The gun fights is decent but not challenging, still loved the variety of guns and how the game forces you to chose new guns rather than stick to what you like. The game also links the puzzles to upgrades by having you solve side puzzles to earn treasures which can be used to upgrade various abilities. It is good to see that the game has a variety of enemies as you will fight mummies, German, Russians and Arabs. each with unique weapons at your disposals as you will tend to pick up their fallen weapons as there are plenty of ammos thus. The BAD: The game is linear in a way that is somewhat cluster phobic, don’t get me wrong for a game that requires you to solve puzzles it requires narrow areas, but since the game itself was able to achieve by landscape for its last puzzle, it led to wonder why this wasn't the case for all the previous puzzles. The game is also very short, I mean looking at the number of hours I have played it above would give you a hint as how short it is, not to mention that I have collected all treasures in one play through. Boss fights are a bit easy and boring, I enjoyed fighting mummies more than fighting bosses. The main character is funny, but I have a Deja vu as if I am playing Duke Nukem all over again, the reason why this is a bad and not a good thing is that, first, I like Duke Nukem to be left alone to be seen only in his games, and two, don’t mix two things I love and expect it to impress me, you are lucky its not in the ugly. The UGLY: The voice acting is, well, UGLY. It is so bad that it over shadows Merritt Weaver Emmy award speech in terms of worseness.  The character modelling would take you back to the time when you first played Metal Gear Solid. I mean for a game that was made on Unreal engine they could have done way better than that. Given the two UGLY things above, resultantly, the cut scenes is something that would take you off of the experience, so much the case that you would dread watching a cut scene. In fact, come to think of it, I believe the game would be way better if there is something that would skip all cut scenes. It is this bad, sorry, this UGLY.  OVERALL: As a fan of Indiana Jones, which the game, to some extent, was successful in mimicking certain aspect of it, I can but only recommend this game as I enjoyed my time playing it and solving the puzzles. The fights is nice way to take you off puzzles and puzzle time is a good way to relax from all the fighting, while mummies, they are there to always keeps you on your toes whether you are solving puzzles or fighting enemies.

												This game is very good in a lot of ways, but lacking in others. First of all, the mummy / zombie enemies that you encounter in the first level are fun as hell to fight and have very realistic movements and amazing models...but you rarely see them at all throughout the game. I'm currently at the ancient Mayan temple part of the game which is the last 3rd or so of it, so maybe they start to show up more just past where I'm at, and I hope they do, because I would have liked to see a lot more of those guys throughout the game than the same old Nazi's and Commie's or whatever. I'm also a bit confused as to why we are fighting both Nazi's and the Russians in this game as its set in WW2 times if I'm correct...the storyline behind your sudden switch in enemies is blurry to me but no matter how it made sense in the game, it was repetitive. Hopefully more interesting baddies will be heading my way towards the latter part of the game. Other than that, the graphics and settings were amazing, the combat was OK. I particularly enjoyed the flashlight feature with which you can temporarily blind your enemies vision. All in all so far an enjoyable, relatively quick adventure story with really cool themes and settings. The enemy base could have used some sprucing up though.			"

But the game is so cheesy and tries to be soo much like uncharted, that it's actually funny. 360 controller has a problem with this game as aiming left and right is laggy. Do not pay $40 for this, and don't play this unless you're drunk, high, or bored out of your mind and in good mood. ( i was not drunk nor high, but im guessing it is fun then)			"

												The voice acting is terrible, or I honestly feel like this would've made an awesome Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider/Uncharted FPS game. The generic action/adventure story is all there. The shooting/gunplay isn’t perfect but pretty solid. The puzzles are simple, but fit the overall feeling of the game. The environments are stunning and a treat to explore. But that voice acting? ...like a gosh darn student project. It’s sad when I think a comedic approach would’ve been LESS immersion breaking than the actual voice actors. Either way, the game is not nearly as bad as everyone seems to think it is, I’d say its worth $10 – $15.			"

												Pretty fun game, basically Indiana Jones kinda thing like you're going through temples and ruins trying to find artifacts while being chased by Nazis. Voice acting isn't that great but everything else is pretty solid aside from a few bugs here and there. Pretty cool upgrade system where you need to find treasure in order to increase your stats. The puzzles are a bit too easy, either that or they're not clear enough but you never really get stuck on them for long. Pretty lengthy game, very lengthy if you try to collect all the artifacts. Not tried multiplayer but apparently it's dead so if you want to get 100% achievements on this game it might not be possible. Overall It's pretty good, lots of guns, lots of enemies and lots of puzzles, fun for all.			"

												Playing this game is like a bi-directional bowel evacuation after you find out the bar you drank at the night before allowed brine from the tainted clams they served to seep into the waterline for the draft beer. The narration evokes Harrison Ford's reading from the Theatrical Cut of Blade Runner, and making the ""Jump"", ""Use"", and ""Pickup Weapon"" button all the same button is the sign of a stroke. Not a stroke of genius, the sign of an actual stroke. And not the good kind that's very minor and clues you into a greater problem with no debilitating effects. We're talking significant motor and reasoning impairment. The main character, James Lee Nathan Quatermain Drake, has the same level of charm you'd see from someone offering candy and free puppies from their white panel van. Not sure if  the game gets better after the first ten minutes. I jumped around like I was trying to fly to Neverland trying to jam the teardrop jewel into the door when I realized the time I had spent on this game was wasted, never to return, and I was resentful of my existence for being temporary, since that was time of my life I'd not get back. The designers were at least thoughtful enough to allow you to quit during a loadscreen. Oh, and I feel like this, and I only spent five dollars on it. Perhaps the extra dollar I spent on the ""Collector's Edition"" is what pushed my drive to write an awful review over the top. I don't know. At any rate, I now hate myself for spending those five dollars on this game instead of seeing if my roommate would eat expired mustard, which I could have also spent that money on.			"

												This small review is based on limited free weekend gameplay. After finishing the first part of the story I wasn't allowed to continue, so practically, what I played was just a 7GB demo. Ouch.The camera nearly made me nauseous at times, but the game is pretty. It's a linear game, but you're allowed, and encouraged, to roam around the places. There are hidden treasures that upgrade your abilities, spread around in nooks and crannies. That's a plus. However, one big room that begged for exploration didn't seem to hold anything, and ending up in the water, that was everywhere, made you drown. In fact, most places you would expect something hidden, you would find nothing.The first taste of combat felt quite awful, but it might just be that the pistols you start off with are bad. I couldn't really hit anything properly. It seemed to improve later on though. There's a nice variety of weapons to use. Some enemies requires using a flashlight in a certain way (like in Alan Wake), but it wasn't explained well, forcing me to look it up.The story seems a bit thin, but alright. The voice synching and face animations could be better though. The puzzles seem fairly easy, but the notebook that is supposed to help you is a bit frustrating to use. It doesn't help that it's bound to the middle mouse button by default, which is also the melee attack button, which I found out by chance. Some of the notes I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to use.All in all, a fair adventure/puzzle FPS game. Honestly, it's quite overpriced (even at 50% off). I suggest picking it up during a sale, if you like this kind of stuff.Notable alternatives: Tomb Raider, Adam's Venture.			"

												When people try to kill two birds with one stone, they usually just waste a stone. It's supposed to be an adventure, but instead it attempts to be an FPS RPG, from what I see. I've played for half an hour, and I've discovered that I have two weapon slots, revolvers have unlimited bullets but take forever to reload, puzzles (on hard level) require you mostly to push a lever or crutch under a door, I can upgrade skills but I have no treasure to upgrade them with, keyboard keys to switch pages of the notebook are not assigned and cannot be reassigned, hints on the screen disappear irrevokably when you accidentally press any key at all, and control settings screen messes up mouse sensitivity. I'd say ""buy it when they fix the bugs"", but since they haven't fixed them by now, there's nothing really to hope for. The plot is so pathetic, I even forgot to mention it: a chick with big boobs gets kidnapped by Nazis who are after an ancient Egyptian treasure, I suppose it can be played, but if you're like me, you won't enjoy it. Life is short, time flies fast, I'm going to spend it on something more deserving.			"

												Got this game free with purchase of new video card. Never herd of it before. IMO it's a very good game. The visuals are pretty stunning. It's a good combination of combat and puzzle solving. If you're like me and love a good single player game you can get wrapped up in then this is a fun one to pick up. The acting is a little cheesy at time but most games are these days. I highly recommend.			"

												I really like this game. After playing some Deadfall Adventures I came to a startling conclusion, we absolutely need more mummies in video games. Deadfall is one of the most entertaining adventure games i have played in a long while. This may be because the game gives me a sense of nostalgia for older games and movies though, but I recommend everyone give it a try at some point or another to draw their own conclusions. Multiplayer is great, if you can find a game, I have noticed that there is not a very large multiplayer scene but the gameplay itself just feels like its doing something right. whether your exploring pyramids in Egypt, ancient Mayan cities, mountain temples, or discovering the mysteries of the lost city of Atlantis, Deadfall has something for everyone. Probably.			"

												EDIT: I made the following review when I completed 2 or 3 missions so i had a good understanding of the game, however after playing a mission called Mines and couldn't figure it out and desided to play something else for a little while to rest my brain for a little. The next day I started it up and clicked continue, and when it started loading it stopped and a message said ""FULL GAME REQURED"" so I when to steam store searched Deadfall adventures and clicked play now. Same problem, ""DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO LOOSE MONEY!""DeadFall Adventures, I think that it is a great Puzzle FPS game. However if you've never played a FPS (First Person Shooter) Puzzle game then you'll most likely want to play it on easy cause if your new to em' it will still be quite challenging. At times I've noticed that the characters don't go where there supposed to go or some of the puzzles don't react how they were ment/programed so you have to reload last checkpoints and at time its kinda anyoying. Some times certian objects that are ment to be in a certian location arn't even there and no matter how many times you reload last check point it will still not work properly unless you restart the level then exit the game a load it again.Overall the game is greatPros-Great graphics-awsome gameplay-challenging puzzles -Fun ChampaneCons-Minor glitiches that are really anyoying (Minor-Major)-Objects/ Characters don't function properly (Minor)-Some sound issues (Minor)			"

												well, I will be honest. the action is good. the puzzles are good, the imagery is good. the movements could be better, but over all not so bad. the one thing I would have to say that is in the bad for me. would be the acting. the acting from the main character, and maybe a few other characters as well. it aounds too much like most of the voice acting team were newcome actors/actresses. where they were fresh off the street. they were that,.. ""un-toned"". so to say. they weren't bleak, per-say, but they did make the personality of their assigned character unbelievable (bad unbelievable, not good) but. later in the game, it does pick up a bit, and improves. over all, the acting being the slight inferior, with everything else being in the better, the over all game mains superior. and this is not just because I love advnture stories/movies/games, but would I recommend this game? [YES]. play it. if you can get over a few set-backs like the voice acting, and maaaaaaaybe some minor clipping. the you will enjoy this game. especially with it being about a descendent of allan quartermain, the character that not only came before, but inspired the films; Indiana Jones (so no, this did not copy off of indiana jones, if you want to get technical, it was the other way around).but don't take my word for it. PLAY IT, you might like it.			"

												It's fun. It might be stupid at points, but it's at least playable, and the graphics are well-polished. I actually want to finish this game, which is sadly becoming a rarer and rarer occurrence for me.Pros:Game is interesting - there's a lot to discover.Puzzles are mostly well-designed, and the notebook hint system works well.The game mechanics are fairly well-adjusted to the style of play. I think the compass mechanic works well most of the time.This game is beautiful even on lower graphics settings. The locations are all authentic-feeling and the graphics are well-polished.Cons, probably because of Linux beta:Instead of putting up a loading screen it'll just blackscreen and freeze for 10-15 seconds.Numerous graphical glitches. especially in the beginning of the game.Loading up the game for the first time just made it hang at the splash screen. I had to close the splashscreen through the window manager to get it to run.""Blood"" -- which looks more like red paint, btw -- isn't cleared from the screen sometimes if you reload from checkpoint while hurt.Game isn't all that well optimized for Linux. I had to turn down the graphics settings to just a hair above ""ugly"" just to get it to run.Puzzles are too easy most of the time. I checked the notebook through the first level only to find I could solve it just by intuition or because it copied a puzzle from Tomb Raider. The notebook, while being a nice puzzle mechanic, isn't necessary most of the time.The enemies are well-designed, even if they're a bit easy.Cons, actual flaws:Game is too easy on normal difficulty. I blame AAA games in general for this. Play on hard for a better experience.Arctic Base level had tons of treasure scattered around the map, but no checkpoints at the beginning. You end up triggering a trap and dying, only to reload with the opening cutscene. Made it frustrating given how large the starting area is.Dialog seems very silly at times. Quartermain isn't an unlikable hero, he just lacks depth. His romance with [s]T*ts McGee[/s] I mean Jennifer Goodwin seems forced, like she's the only poundable thing within miles so why not? Whatever, it's stupid.Controls are a bit strange. It's really apparent it was designed for a controller. For example, bringing up the notebook involves holding down the scroll wheel on the mouse and awkwardly moving the cursor around. (Or you can just hit [ or ].)All in all, I'd say it's well worth the money. Not sure about the DLC though. Grab it if you can, you'll have fun playing it. "

												Summer-Rain enters the house to find everythinginside looking a lot like an Egyptian tomb. Startled,she spins round only to find a Mummy breathingheavily while the world beyond the porch is theinterior of a Pyramid.Before she can scream, you rush to her side, dressedlike Indiana Jones sans hat and jamming a weaponfrom a bygone era up at the Mummy's chin. Firingpoint-blank, the Mummy dies as you turn round tocheck on Summer-Rain.She's hysterical, screaming that she came homeearly from classes to spend quality time with you,and here you are, playing another game that hasfallen to the wayside.DEADFALL ADVENTURES!Summer-Rain is adamant now, her silky hairlooking very frazzled from the stress of yourdigital adventure taking over reality again. You tryto explain that this is simply the game's immersion,and that it's really just a simple first-person shooterat its core with some complex puzzle elements. She's scowling now, your beautiful flower of death.Crossing her arms, she angrily says that in the timethat she's with you, she knows all about your habitswith 'immersion'. When she opens her eyes, she's not surprised in the slightest that the entire living room has morphed into an Arctic tundra, with you at the steps of some ancient, forgotten temple entrance.You hunch over your flight coat and give her your hand,beckoning. Summer-Rain groans her signature groan.She asks if this is simply the stairs up and you grab herto shelter her from the violent snowstorm. Inside, shelooks in wonder at the remnants of a lost civilization,an endless series of stone carvings with light shiningupon them providing an eerie tranquility. Summer-Rain asks what are you both doing here, beforeyou explain that according to the writings of a certain Allan Quatermain, Esq, the key to unlocking Deadfall isin this forgotten Pyramid in the ice, an artifact known asthe Heart of Atlantis. Summer-Rain raises her eyebrow,asking if this is the same Allan Quatermain that writerH. R. Haggard had his character star in. You nod, sayingthat so far, it's like a thinking man's 'Doom.'Suddenly, Russians appear! You curse under your breathas a firefight breaks out and hand Summer-Rain a rifle,muttering that you thought when you escaped the Nazisin the Sakkaran desert along with the Mummies, that thatwould be the end of it. Summer-Rain groans at you again,quipping that in a game like this, its never that easy.You fight off the Russians and a battalion of returningNazis through an abandoned mine, exploring crevassesand caves for Maps and Ancient Idols which can be used toupgrade your health and gunplay mechanics. Summer-Rainasks if there was anything that she had missed and you hand her an Ancient Idol to improve her marksmanshipstats.You tell her that was from the levels she missed in Egyptbefore kissing her briefly and opening a secret door deepwithin the Arctic Temple. You exit a world away, in the dense, lush jungles of the Maya. You tell Summer-Rain that with the Heart of Atlantis and the many scattered maps recovered, any more puzzles can be solved easily and the mystery of Xibalba, the mystery of Deadfall- can be revealed.Summer-Rain grows ever more worried, with the amount ofMayan undead warriors swarming from the shadows and zombie Gorilla-beings baying for both of your blood.The Russians encounter you one final time with whateverremains of their expeditionary force, but you and Summer-Rain make quick work of them with the amount ofAncient Idol upgrades and weapon variety you have at yourdisposal.Finally, you arrive in the magma-soaked depths of Xibalba,to find that the ultimate villain, Dr. Heinrich Hagen, turned into an Avatar of otherworldly power and hellbent on globaldestruction. It's up to you in this final fight as Summer-Rainis surrounded by the armies of the dead, summoned byUberhagen. You draw your Quatermain pistols that have served you well throughout the adventure and unleash a barrage of firepowerthat the best of mankind's weapons have to offer. You alternate between dynamite, rifles and even RPGs beforereverting again to your trusty Quatermain pistols when Uberhagen falters in his would-be ascension.Glancing at Summer-Rain, you shout that you'll do you best.Summer-Rain pushes past another Mayan undead warriorbefore shooting it through the torso, nodding that she knowsthat you always do. You take aim at Uberhagen and fire.The world flashes to white as you and Summer-Rain awakeat the foot of your bed. Blinking, you sit up and find thatyou're still dressed in Quatermain's adverturer attire as youtry to feel if your limbs are still attached, with Summer-Rain opposite you sporting a matching look, equally confusedand worried. After a time, both of you can speak again.""I-"" You begin, before Summer-Rain finishes for you.""I think we've finished Deadfall."" Summer-Rain exclaims, looking about your bedroom. You nod silently, almost eagerly,glad that you and her finished it, saved the world, and mostimportantly, saved each other. Summer-Rain smiles again, the same smile that you knew when you first got together with her over a different game.""Front porch and driveway as ancient Egypt, living room andstairwell as the Arctic Temple and our bedroom as Xibalba?my my... you have quite an imagination, don't you?"" She whispers in your ear, unholstering the Quatermain pistol youhave with you. ""Little early for Halloween, isn't it?""""It's never early for a game like this either..."" You manageto reply to Summer-Rain, before you embark on a whole newadventure of your own together with her.DEADFALL ADVENTURES! "

												I find it odd that the 'free weekend' is just a demo. From what I played the visuals were well done. However the aim seemed to be off and it took what felt like half a clip for each individual enemy. Other than that it looks like a game I'd buy on a hefty sale (not meaning it isn't worth the money). The voice acting wasn't top notch and the lines were pretty corny as well. But sometimes you just need a little corny. I still recommend it. :)			"

												Although I did have quite some fun with this game, it is sadly shoddily executed at way too many parts: Grenades and dynamite clip through the ground, not damaging enemies, infinite invisible walls, reload times are ridiculously long, weapon accuracy is terrible, movement speed is unrealistic, animations look wonky, voice acting is terrible, writing is even worse, the upgrade system is pointless, puzzles are way too easy and more tedious than ingenious and the list goes on and on.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game per se and it's not supposed to be a triple A title, but I cannot recommend this to anyone who has ever played Uncharted, the new Tomb Raider games or Alan Wake.

The terrible voice acting is completely immersion breaking (that is if you could even become immersed in the first place). The little i played reaked of bad B movie dialogue. I also encountered a game breaking bug in less than 20 minutes of play. I had to restart the game to continue. I had high hopes of this being a fun Indiana Jones'esque adventure game.

												God, where to start? This game is so bad.First of all, for a modern FPS, the controls are utter garbage. Invisible walls everywhere, you can't jump over the smallest obstacles and switching weapons/items only works half the time, because it doesn't work if some animation isn't completely finished. Gunplay feels off and just bad.Graphics are bad for a 2013 game.Writing feels like a bad B-movie Indiana Jones rip-off, basically get some ancient artefact before the evil Nazis do. At least as far as I've played, but I don't think it gets any better.Which brings me to the next point: as if the writing itself wasn't bad enough, the voice acting is not even B-movie tier, it's worse-than-porn tier, not even exaggerating here, it really is THAT bad.Also, I really wonder, what is the point of having treasure maps in the game, if the maps are completely unreadable? Seriously, in the levels I played, the maps didn't even remotely resemble the outline of the levels, it's like they were made for completely different locations. And this in a game, where the treasure-seeking is the only half-way interesting part of it.Got this from a bundle, still feel ripped off. Don't touch this, not even on a sale!			"

												Can't understand all the negative reviews surrouding this because it's actually a decent adventure game. I only played through the trial which was about an hour of the game and have to say, I was having fun. Will definitely be getting this a some point as it's very entertaining. Graphics are incredible, especially the lighting effects. Sure the gameplay uses a lot of ideas from other games, but thats not a bad thing at all. Its like a big mix between indiana jones, tomb raider, uncharted, with elements of alan wake as well as others. Probably not worth £30 but if you see it for under £15, hit it up quickly.			"

												That's sarcasm down there, people! Chill your back ends!Yet another FPS game where Americans eventually kills everybody they meet on the scene. Well, maybe except for a few Arabs in the prologue. I'm not here to sound all pollutical, and I have to say, despite being the very unoriginal, the story itself isn't the problem of the game. In fact, it's fun. Yeah, people loves Indiana Jones type of archeology, and, even being all that repetitive, the stories of some Nazi looking for over the world for powerful ancient artefacts - and some daredevils trying to stop them - still don't get old. After all those years. The game authors sinks even deeper and binding to the game the spirit of the famous book adventurer, Allan Quatermain, even if feels a bit of a necromancy.Yet, I repeat, the story is ok. Trivial, stupid - but ok, fitting the current standards. The sounding is lacking, the scripts are sometimes really bad, but all that is not making the game awful. The visuals are not bad, for the consoles in the year 2013. The jungles, snows, and sands are colourful, all playing the part, you know. Graphically, that's acceptable game.Now, what is really disappointing - is how it plays. It's on-the-rail first-person view shooter, see? And... it goes worse than the very first Call of Duty. The process of the shooting is so annoying, that I really suggest everyone to play (if you decide to play it) only on the easiest difficulty. It's really not the game where you'll be enjoying with the gunplay. Were the Deadfall a 2-d sidescroller - that would suit it much better. You know, with all those big white bubbles, coming out of the rifles, and dummy enemies, running towards you no matter what?I must admit, the riddles in the game process were not all that easy (at least for me, I've played on the hard setting). And I'm really happy that there's the possibility to tune the game difficulty for the riddles and shootouts separately. If you decide to try the game, no matter what, please, use the difficulty choices wisely.Finally, as an obvious and predictable downvote point, there is a dead multiplayer. And about 20 achievements tied to it (for those of you who collect achievements).Primitive action game which looks like a product of later 00' - early 10', but plays like we're back in the 90's. It was not worth the price when it was released, and it's definitely not worth your money with every passing year. A dispensable stuff. Mark 5/10, and only for some (few) good puzzles in the process. Still, there are plenty of much more tasty fish around, even on the narrow Indiana Jones path.			"

												""Deadfall Adventures""..... More like ""Dead...."" The single player experience is decent, graphics are sub-par for what we expect these days. Puzzles are more time consuming then actual tests of thought.  AI is incredibly dumb even on hard. crappy UI and poorly thought out controls will have you customizing them before you even take your first plunge into a tomb. Multiplayer shouldn't even exsist in the menu, considering that there are NO servers and NO players for the game... apperently. Refreshed and checked all connections to make sure everything was up to par when I was retrieving no servers in my list...turns out, im as dumb as a box of rocks, OR the multiplayer is just flat out poor and dead... Soooo.... as a multiplayer advocate, I instally deleted local files, dropped this in the♥♥♥♥♥♥bin of my library and wrote this review. Save yourself some time and just forget about this dead P.O.S.

												Deadfall Adventures is basically what happens if you combine Alan Wake, Resident Evil, The Mummy, and Indiana Jones together into a game. It features puzzles that have to be navigated in the same way as Uncharted - by physically looking ingame at your notebook to determine the solution. These include puzzles like your classic Elder Scrolls/Indiana Jones floor tile puzzles, light-mirror puzzles like The Mummy/Resident Evil. lighting the right symbols or pressing the right buttons in the right order, slider puzzles, platforming type puzzles and more.Like any good archaeology-fantasy story, it takes place in the early days of the Nazi regime. The Nazi's have, of course, obtained the services of experts to navigate ancient ruins in search oif ancient powers that can ostensibly help them rule the world, etc. etc. Did I also mention Russians? So within minutes, what does your character end up doing? Evidently awakening all the mummies and other ancient beasts. All of them.This is where Alan Wake comes in. In order to actually damage and kill said beasties, you need to hit them with the flashlight enough so that shooting them matters. The mechanic made sense in Alan Wake because of the light and the dark being a permanent theme. I'm not sure it makes sense here, but I'm not complaining about it. I think in the Mummy movies the light wasn't kind to the mummies either. Other than shooting Mummies, though, you get to kill your fair share of ""Nazis"" - and really that's all you need for a game, right? As well as Commies. The voice acting is bad, I'm not going to sugarcoat that. All of the VA's said their lines far too quickly and didn't seem interested in putting effort into it. In addition, a lot of the dialogue is very B-movie, generic, absolutely expected drivel. It's unfortunate, because this game had the potential to be quite awesome if the presentation had been pulled off with a bit more polish or experience. Presentation can turn a horrible game like Uncharted from a generic shooter to a phenomenon, and it looks like Nordic stopped somewhere in the middle with this one. Other than that, the game is also gorgeous. It doesn't have the best graphics ever that will melt your eyeballs, but it uses Unreal engine and looks quite good. There's a lot of epic scenery like the pyramids and Sphinx, but you may get tired of seeing it if you aren't into ancient cultures or Egyptology or any of that.The only thing to really complain about other than the overall indie-ness of this game is just silly stuff like bugs where you get stuck ffor no good reason behind or inside objects. I actually fell like 100 feet when you rescue Jen from the Russian colonel guy, and didn't die - which I thought was hilarious. Other than that, the Steam store page is full of bullshots. I'm playing on as ultra graphics as possible with a GTX 1080 and the game simply doesn't look like that in most of those scenes.			"

												I have really enjoyed playing this game (with one or two reservations). Unfortunately the lead character is probably only 4' 6"" tall judging by how little movement there was between crouching and standing; basically I felt the camera was far too low all the time and had a terrible bouncing walk! (I must admit I do prefer third person games!) The balance of difficulty in combat and puzzle solving is just right for enjoying the flow of the game; with one exception. For the very last fight you have to be psycic unless you check out an online walkthrough to learn how to win; which spoiled a very good game. On the whole though I would thoroughly recommend it.			"

												Update: Was too kind in my last review. I wanted to like this game. It had a ton of potential. But it's clunky, repetitive, annoying, and at the point in the mayan ruins where you go sliding down...gave up after 10+ attempts...it's near impossible to complete. Seriously.. Run, gun, puzzle, run, gun...no thank you. Wish I could get a refund >.>Wish there was a neutral option for recommending a game :)I will try to be fair in this review....I've been paying this for ~6 hours now, and while the premise is really fun, like playing out an Indiana Jones adventure, the delivery can be really so so at times.  The graphics, effects, etc. are all great. Great job by the devs on that.  The story is also fun as I mentioned.  Gameplay is where things get mixed.  On one hand, it's a FPS.  On the other, a FPS adventure puzzle game.  Sometimes you can mix the two really well, and other times it falls a bit flat.  In this game so far, it falls a bit flat.  The formula seems to be the same.. expore a little, fight some enemies, annoying puzzle, fight some enemies, explore a bit, add infinum.  I really wish there was a bit more variety and slightly more openness to tackling issues.  Puzzles in this game I get, you have to execute something a certain way for it to work.  Fine. But give some options, change it up a bit.  Flipping a dial and shooting a thing gets pretty old after a while.  My other two gripes thus far are with the voice actor for the main character...really..really...flat.  He has a good voice, but 0 emotion.  Basically it sounds like a cocky♥♥♥♥♥♥reading from a script.  Meanwhile the other characters got into it.  Lastly, this feels more like a limited console game than anything in terms of moving around.  I should be able to climb a ladder for a better vantage point, or up a few rocks stacked like blocks. I shouldn't be limited to just running around the small field given.  While a game should always have an ending and a means to get there, and while you don't have to make it super interactive to the point where it'd be rediculous, the game just feels so limited in a world where exploring should be more encouraged and rewarded.Is it an enjoyable game? Sure. Is it a really great game? Meh...			"

												I got it on sale so it was worth it to me. If I would have bought the game at $40 I would not have been as happy. The single player was so-so. Only 1 puzzle in the entire game actually had me stumped. But it was fun going through temple ruins and what not.			"

												A really nice game that adresses that child in me, that dreamed to be Indiana Jones. Yeah it is a console port, a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ textures, but ive seen worse cough Rage cough. And it may be in first person and you may shoot guns, but it feels play more like a action adventure just in first person, the gunplay is sos loughable bad, the weapon sounds are as toyish like in Call of Doody, but the fights are more than just spread a magazine on an enemy. And i would say it's totally okay for this game, since it's doesn't claim to be a t1 shooter game, rather an exploration game.			"

												Update: Was too kind in my last review. I wanted to like this game. It had a ton of potential. But it's clunky, repetitive, annoying, and at the point in the mayan ruins where you go sliding down...gave up after 10+ attempts...it's near impossible to complete. Seriously.. Run, gun, puzzle, run, gun...no thank you. Wish I could get a refund >.>Wish there was a neutral option for recommending a game :)I will try to be fair in this review....I've been paying this for ~6 hours now, and while the premise is really fun, like playing out an Indiana Jones adventure, the delivery can be really so so at times.  The graphics, effects, etc. are all great. Great job by the devs on that.  The story is also fun as I mentioned.  Gameplay is where things get mixed.  On one hand, it's a FPS.  On the other, a FPS adventure puzzle game.  Sometimes you can mix the two really well, and other times it falls a bit flat.  In this game so far, it falls a bit flat.  The formula seems to be the same.. expore a little, fight some enemies, annoying puzzle, fight some enemies, explore a bit, add infinum.  I really wish there was a bit more variety and slightly more openness to tackling issues.  Puzzles in this game I get, you have to execute something a certain way for it to work.  Fine. But give some options, change it up a bit.  Flipping a dial and shooting a thing gets pretty old after a while.  My other two gripes thus far are with the voice actor for the main character...really..really...flat.  He has a good voice, but 0 emotion.  Basically it sounds like a cocky♥♥♥♥♥♥reading from a script.  Meanwhile the other characters got into it.  Lastly, this feels more like a limited console game than anything in terms of moving around.  I should be able to climb a ladder for a better vantage point, or up a few rocks stacked like blocks. I shouldn't be limited to just running around the small field given.  While a game should always have an ending and a means to get there, and while you don't have to make it super interactive to the point where it'd be rediculous, the game just feels so limited in a world where exploring should be more encouraged and rewarded.Is it an enjoyable game? Sure. Is it a really great game? Meh...			"

												This is actually a really nice game. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Puzzles won't hurt your brain and shootouts aren't for hardcore FPSers, but if you want a romp through nice landscapes with an Indiana Jones style story and very decent voice acting then go for it. Espesh if it's on offer ;-)Only downside is no one seems to be playing the muliplayer, but if you can schedule with your buddies this could be fun too.			"

												BIG TIP / WARNING:  HAVE YOUR COMPASS OUT AT ALL TIMES POSSIBLE WHEN NOT IN COMBAT (I elaborate later on this) there is a little compass icon that pops up in the bottom left corner when one is near, but it's easy to miss, especially if you are in combat at the time, because it only shows up once.  Although, sadly, it still doesn't always point to each treasure *shrug*TL;DRI've been liking it a lot because it's a first person shooter action adventure puzzle game with nice environments (recommended despite my issues with it because there's not a game I know quite like this done was well that I can think of), surprising because it looked kind of cheesy at first.  It has some finicky elements, but it has a unique blend of FPS action and puzzles which I wish more games used.  I wish they had a better save and load system (not just widely spaced checkpoints, which exacerbate many other problems in the game) without getting blocked off from exploring (one of the draws of the game to find and solve the puzzles), more play-testing for ""puzzle solutions"" with highlighting of intractable items, and less invisible wall locations (I know this was to try to prevent people getting stuck, but with a better save system it wouldn't have been a problem).Cool Things: *** I can play this with the Steam Controller in precision aiming mode (where right pad is mouse and gyro is low sensitivity).  Because it responds to controller and mouse at the same time.*** Shooting feels good, movement feels fine (bind sprint to the outside edge of the left joystick on the Steam controller for faster play).*** Has puzzles! Nothing too brain-bending, but I really like having it that way because it breaks up the pacing of the shooting without being too pace killing in the opposite direction (you use your grandfather's notebook of sketches for each puzzle for hints if you get stuck).  UPDATE after playing a while:  the puzzles start becoming really hit and miss due to arbitrary things like ""Oh, I guess I can shoot that, but not this for some reason ... etc.""*** Crisp graphics and lighting.  Very cool looking environments, took a lot of screenshots.***  Story elements aren't super awesome, but it's not that bad, and it's nice having voice acting, a story, and occasional cut-scenes instead of non-stop bloodbath.  However, the animations look very dated in the cutscenes, and the love story is cringe-worthy.MEH List:  So hopefully developers can see these items***  There are so many little fiddley gameplay mechanics that bring the game grinding to a halt.  I'll list a couple.Having to find 3 small coins in a huge room for a balance (no they don't glow, no they aren't in super special obvious spots).Mayan gem puzzle that still makes no sense.For instance, ""Oh look a crowbar, put I can't pick it up just because even though I've been able to in the past, weird.""  Blows up a door across the map seemingly unrelated.  ""Hmmm, I guess now I need a crowbar, but that one couldn't be picked up....""  Checks it across the map, finally able to picked up. Oh, cool, controls to these crains, I'll try pushing the buttons, oh it doesn't work, weird, I guess I'll try to activate it (wanders around forever looking, looks it up online, oh I have to HOLD the button, even though no other button in the game required being held down, gotit).  Oh I need to blow up random things that typically have never really been blow up in this game to fiddly get these crains to the right spot after a huge awesome battle grinding the game to a halt, causing me to look it up online for the ""solution"" only to find that it's ridiculous ad-hoc solution ridiculousness.  This seems like something that would have been a huge red-flag in game testing.  Oh, and I jump down and the boss just disappears with no explanation.SO MANY invisible walls and randomly un-jumpable things.  It just feels like a very old game with a lot of these mechanics.Finnicky/bugged sliding instant death section.  You are supposed to avoid obstacles, which is fine, but for some reason, there's a part where you can either go left or right through one of the gaps (both are clear) so it shouldn't matter which one you take, however, if you don't pick the left one, somehow one of the other slides down the way doesn't work properly (which is extra odd, because it's on the opposite side), which should have worked. ***  Biggest pet peeve so far is the saving system, checkpoints only with no way to force a checkpoint save as a poor-man's manual save.  Many of the checkpoints are terribly placed, and there's no way to pick which checkpoint you load to.  It makes the other issues I have with the game worse, for instance, the game wants you to explore to get treasures, but often leaving an area a certain way will block off the old area and you can't explore anymore (it happened many times to me, and I like exploring, but would be randomly stuck unable to go back through no fault of my own).  With a manual saving system, this wouldn't be a problem, but because they only let you have checkpoints, and the checkpoints only activate twice, it makes exploring seem like a liability. ***  I really wish I had taken my compass out more towards the beginning (luckily you can have a pistol in other hand, you don't get the compass at the beginning, I can't remember when I got it) and/or been shown to use it.  It points towards treasures, which can also guide you to puzzles, but it's not really given a tutorial, and I didn't even notice I had gotten it.  Since treasures are the only way to get upgrades, it's pretty important.			"

												Nice Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, Alan Wake, Uncharted hybrid style of game on a smaller budget but still fun adventure-puzzle-shooter.  7.5/10WARNING: Some bugs could leave you stranded and unable to proceed.UPDATE: After trying again over a year later, many times and restarting the level a few times, watching walkthroughs and doing the exact same things I was somehow able to get by that area, but be warned it could happen to others.I got to the moving statues part in the pyramids only about 2 hours in and can't proceed. I wasted about 2 hours on it alone going over the buttons and trying to follow my hand map saying 3x's push this one etc. I looked up Walkthrough Videos and did the exact same thing they did (just stood on the button to the right and enemies came out for them) and tried everything and it does nothing (but move the statue except no enemies as seen in the walkthroughs or the wall fails to open up all the way). I even restarted the level to reboot it and still same issue, so am stuck! It reminds me of Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 with such bugs that restrict going on. Until this is fixed and the game is consistent for all, I have to give a thumbs down.  I will have to uninstall, have too many good games to waste more time on such issues which will probably continue then.  The game seemed pretty promising too!The other puzzles are decent, although the little hand maps leave lots of guess work, I guess they want it like the real world - you would have to do things via trial and error, but with no assist after awhile that is not very entertaining and a waste of time. The graphics performance and combat were good to this point.  Otherwise it would have been a 8 of 10 so far.I hope they fix the bugs because it can be a fun and under-rated game!			"

Over the top, schlocky and seen many times before - But somehow the whole is more than the sum of its parts.Good: Environments, Variety, PuzzlesOkay: Plot, GunplayBad: Save point system (weirdly spaced), can get locked out of exploration puzzlesSo bad it ends up being good: Voice acting, dialogueOverall, a solid 7/10 in my book, and worth picking up.

												Definitely worth picking up, I won't insult the developers by saying you should buy it on sale, though it is a high price point considering the age of the game. In saying that, it's quite well made and the puzzles will leave you scratching your head more than once. Worst part for me was if you died in between the save points (some of them between gun fights) and you had done a puzzle in the meantime (usually achievement driven puzzles) then you have to do the puzzle again to get the treasure. I had a problem after I died after completing the 8 piece puzzle which you have to move around piece-by-piece to get the picture right. I'm crap at those but I managed to do it twice after dying the first time. Maybe there's a quick save but I didn't see it (I am an idiot after all).I would also say that some puzzles were as vague as anything, but overall a good quality game.8/10 would enjoy a sequel with more varied puzzles.

												Ultimately I found Deadfall Adventures to be quiet frustrating, with lower quality than I would have expected given the graphical quality. Poor checkpointing coupled with poor production values (im not talking about the gorgeous graphics, Im talking about clipping through the floor near the edge of a hole/cliff, getting stuck on geometry, etc) is an extremely frustrating combo. The rest of the game looks amazing, and I love the fantasy, but even those moments are marred by the juvenile script and writing.How could this be better? Add quicksaves, redo/remove all cutscenes, and go through and fix all the level geometry. You'd then have an recommendable game. It still wouldnt be great though. How to move it into great? My view is remove the arcade fights (which are at best forgettable), and go for more simulated gritty survival horror combat (think Dark Corners of the Earth) - I think at this point Deadfall Adventures would be quite special.

												It's a rare game that can keep my interest long enough for me to complete it. Guess what? I beat it! And... I only paid $5! Can't say that it was an awesome game, but it was really good. And I did play long enough to finish it.4 out of 5. Probably won't play again, but I'm not sorry I paid $5 and played it through to the end.			"

												Fans of the Uncharted, Tomb Raider games along with the Indiana Jones and the Mummy movie serie will undoubtley find a lot of action sequences, locales, quotes and other similarities that will bring back great memories of so called franchises. Unfortuantly for all its similarity its lack of having a lead actor with any personailty drowns out its ability to carve out its own identity along with some design execution that makes Deadfall merely just a good game that only fans of such series would enjoy.In the game you play as adventurer James Quatermain who is hired by a former colleuge to retrieve an artificat, the heart of atlantis. You globe trott from Egyptian pyramids, to the artic and finally to the jungles of the Mayan ruins during your adventure. Along the way you will battle nazis(Hate those guys), undead zombies, and some hired guns but that pretty much is the extent of enemies. As for gameplay there is basic FPS action which is solid, though enemy AI has limited movement and at times the game can feel like its on rails. When battling mummies and the undead you will revert to Alan Wake comabt of using a flashlight to burn them so they become vulnerable to weapons. Wepons are era based from dual pistols and shotguns, to MP40, rocket launcher, and assortment of other machine guns. The wepons all sound, look, and feel good and the reloading animation is quality. When not fighting your way to the next checkpoint there are numerous puzzles to solve. This is by far the weakest element of the game as they are very difficult and in some cases make no sense. i would challenge anyone to try and solve every puzzle without a waltkthru, they are that obtuse. Deadfall has a lot going for it, unfortunantley it doesnt all come together but with such limited adventure chocices for PC players, its worth putting on your fedora, shootoing nazis and looking for treasure. That never gets old.PositivesExcellant level design, enviroments and graphicsSolid FPS shooter actionLead actress is the starMine cart level-SpectacularNegativesFeels like Modders first gamehero cant jump or swimVery easy game even on hardest difficulty settingNo personailtyLack of enemiesPuzzles can be basic to huh?Terrible AIPredictable storyline "

												First Impressions:Combat didn't ""WOW"" me in any particular way, though I did enjoy the atmosphere and puzzle elements.  I also like the fact that you can set both the combat and puzzle difficulties separately.  The upgrades are very basic...collect treasure in order to upgrade your passive skills (increase health, improved aim, etc.).  I haven't played it enough to know if it's worth $40, but I feel that it is worth the $4 I paid during a Bundle Stars sale.

												a bit buggy (a puzzle which was bugging out in June according to discussions is still doing the same thing) and not as 'exploration friendly' as even the tutorial text in the game leads you to believe - go down the wrong corridor or approach a cut scene trigger even in a room and you are forced forward. lots of invisible walls preventing you looking around too much and i got trapped simply jumping behind a block at the start. not worth it unless its on a steam sale.

												Ultimately I found Deadfall Adventures to be quiet frustrating, with lower quality than I would have expected given the graphical quality. Poor checkpointing coupled with poor production values (im not talking about the gorgeous graphics, Im talking about clipping through the floor near the edge of a hole/cliff, getting stuck on geometry, etc) is an extremely frustrating combo. The rest of the game looks amazing, and I love the fantasy, but even those moments are marred by the juvenile script and writing.How could this be better? Add quicksaves, redo/remove all cutscenes, and go through and fix all the level geometry. You'd then have an recommendable game. It still wouldnt be great though. How to move it into great? My view is remove the arcade fights (which are at best forgettable), and go for more simulated gritty survival horror combat (think Dark Corners of the Earth) - I think at this point Deadfall Adventures would be quite special.

												Gameplay itself is actually quite good. The storyline over all seems fairly interesting... but the writing and cutscene animation is so abhorrent that I had to stop and uninstall. I've never done that before. It made me feel like I was watching some gary's mod animations. Characters are utterly static and one dimensional. The ""hero"" is essentially a douchey drunk and the girl is the ""super smart scientist"" who strings him along for some reason. I couldnt do it. The writing is just too amateurish. Couple this with flailing limbs and twisting/breaking necks during cut scenes and yea... i can't recommend this title. If you're on the fence, i say dont bother.			"

												Definitely worth picking up, I won't insult the developers by saying you should buy it on sale, though it is a high price point considering the age of the game. In saying that, it's quite well made and the puzzles will leave you scratching your head more than once. Worst part for me was if you died in between the save points (some of them between gun fights) and you had done a puzzle in the meantime (usually achievement driven puzzles) then you have to do the puzzle again to get the treasure. I had a problem after I died after completing the 8 piece puzzle which you have to move around piece-by-piece to get the picture right. I'm crap at those but I managed to do it twice after dying the first time. Maybe there's a quick save but I didn't see it (I am an idiot after all).I would also say that some puzzles were as vague as anything, but overall a good quality game.8/10 would enjoy a sequel with more varied puzzles.

Okay, I said to myself, the name is cool.I really liked to play Emperors Tomb back in the day, and this had my curiosity right now.It looked more like a puzzle game for kids.But I gave it a shot and I am more than impressed.Uncharted is not as good as this in my opinion. Sure, this game needs polishing, but in its raw nature, this game is on of the best and 10/10.I did not play until the end by now, because I have it just since midnight xDThe game plays like Bioshock Infinite a bit and has decent graphics thanks to the Unreal Engine. The work which is put into this game is incredible for me. It is cheap but good looking at the same time. And THIS is rare nowadays. All in all, I would like to see a sequel to this game.

												Inane dialogue by Quartermain that just grinds and annoys placing emphacis on random words like a cheap reality star. Puzzles that are irrelevant and just plain useless.

												This was a good game! Sure there are weaknesses--modeling & voice acting, the odd environmental limitations in a game about action & exploration (swimming is death, ladders are decoration, no compass use in a snowstorm) and a missing objective list in a linear game. Most elements were familiar, but the cool parts made those drawbacks minor by comparison to the varied locales and combat, impressive art & architectural design, worthy puzzles and organic but mystical upgrade schema.Overall, this was an enjoyable and memorable entry to the action-adventure genre.

												Finished this around 8-9 hours game time. Graphics (maxed settings), sound, music, gun-play were all really good I especially loved the level design. Didn't experience a single crash, fully customizable controls and FOV slider. Good mixture of action and puzzle solving. It at all can't be good, the dialog, script, cut-scenes are borderline unwatchable. It is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad its cringe worthy. This game had almost everything going for it except that, it seems they spent all their money on the game/music/sound and everything else was an after thought. That being said I really liked the game. I have played some stinkers in my gaming years and this is definitely redeemable. I snapped some screen shots for you guys just so you can see how nice the levels looked. If you can get past the awful cut-scenes and enjoy the game for what it is I definitely recommend this just wait for a good deal.			"

												It took me hardly four hours to beat the game on hard (puzzle and enemy wise),Levels are very linear and trophies are barely hidden which leads to zero replayability (i collected everything on my first playthrough without even trying to actually hunt them down),Awful voice acting, obvious story, uninspired enemies with a total of (as i remember) six enemies, too two of these are literally the same (im talking about the shield guys, also one of the enemies only appeared in the first level),when it first released it had a pricetag of 40€ on it,Multiplayer is based on ""Veterans crush new players"", in different words: you unlock the best guns/equippement pretty late while you start of with bad/mediocre guns/equippement,Oh and its also straight ripped of from cod when it comes to combat overall besides some traps on the map.

												Deadfall adventures isn't going to amaze you or stun you with its original story or dialogue. It is really quite the opposite. That being said, it's a  fun, OK game, resurfacing the Indianna Jones atmosphere that has been deeply missed. However, it is full of glitches with a crappy checkpoint save system. Yes, a checkpoint save system in an exploration game. Who would have thought. In the beginning I attempted to collect all the treasure via my handy compass treasure-pointer, yet, once I ran off to collect my treasure to only be killed instantly it was a bit frustrating. Nevertheless I try again, and again. Fixed on getting this one piece of treasure, but each time I was killed instantly I was forced to run all the way back (roughly 4 minutes)  purchase my upgrades again and THEN attempt the puzzle again. My character kept getting stuck in ridiculous places, forcing me to restart from the nearest save and collect all the treasure I had collected previously ... again.The dialogue, oh the dialogue. Filled with corny, primary school aged teasing-flirtatious remarks that make you facepalm while having to endure it throughout the entire campaign. I could get past this, if it wasn't for the crappy save system or the glitches but sadly, it all comes together, ruining my experience as a player.To add some positive in my otherwise negative review, the settings are beautiful and gorgeous to explore and the action isn't bad. I recommend picking this game up on a sale of at least 60% off or more, the asking price of $40 is a bit over the top.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game Deadfall Adventures is a first person action/adventure game developed by The Farm 51 and published by Nordic Games. In Deadfall Adventures you play as James Lee Quatermain, an adventurer who struggles to live up to his legendary adventurer of a grandfather, Allan QuatermainQuatermain's new job is to escort a US agent called Jennifer Goodwin through an Egyptian temple to find an ancient treasure which will eventually lead you all across the world killing mummies and chasing Nazis and it looks like Deadfall Adventures is inspired by Indiana Jones and Naughty Dog's UnchartedDeadfall Adventures has some good graphics with good visual effects yet some poor character animations. Surprisingly, good puzzles, they are challenging and often take a lot of thinking to solve but never feel too hard and the combat difficulty and puzzle difficulty can be changed independently via the settings menu The game has an Interesting mix of genre with an overall mediocre gunplay apart from an interesting mechanic involving mummies and flashlights which seems to copy Remedy's Alan Wake. There are some cool and pretty big locations with lots of hidden collectibles to findThere is a relatively wide variety of weapons with a good variety of enemies to fight however they can become rinse and repeat nearing the end of the game and there are some great atmospheric settings in the gameSurprisingly, Deadfall Adventures performs well on high settings with little to no framerate drops with simple controls. However, all of the humour in the game is very cheesy and cringy, and I hardly laughed at the supposed 'funny' dialogueDeadfall Adventures does suffer with bland and terrible voice acting and I noticed a fair few typos and occasionally missing words in the subtitlesThere is an uninteresting story based around uninteresting characters taking references to other better movies and games such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and the Uncharted series and the game is riddled with bugs and glitchesThe puzzle hints are almost entirely useless and the checkpoints are few and far between. As mentioned previously, Deadfall Adventures suffers with some very clunky animationsDespite some issues I had fun playing Deadfall Adventures with its good graphics, good puzzles and its interesting genre combination. If you're a fan of Indiana Jones and Uncharted style of things then I suggest you pick this one up while it's on sale however not at full price... RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Nice game, but there are certain situations were you want to hit a sandbag - at least i wanted to do it.4 Examples:1. There is a door. You go near it. It says, ""Maybe dynamit"". You search and find danymite. Back to the door. Place it. It explodes. You go to the door. It will not open.So.... what to do?! Exactly! Instead that the character says ""hm, seems like i need something else to open the door"", he just says nothing (at least in my case). So you have to guess what the developer might thought about that. The problem: I already had a bug in the beginning of the game (3 symbols in the ground, you had to step on them).Now, i m not sure if this is a bug too or not.Just let the character tell that he need something else.2. Same thing, different place. There is a vent you have to pull. But in order to do that you have to pull another one to get rid of the hot steam at the first one.You did that but when you want to pull the first one again, you get damage. No hint what to do - at least in my case.Again, i had a bug in the beginning. So this might be another bug - if the character would tell you that he would need something else again i would not thinking about a bug and try to restart again and again.3. You are in a jungle. There is a treasure that is just a meter away from you. But you cannot grab it - also the space between the two status is big enough for you.So you wander around to find the place to enter to get it. The problem, as long as you do not have ""dynamite"" on you, you will not get the hint / information ""Press [x] to place"". And this time the character does not say ""maybe dynamite"". So, you are left guessing again - at least i was.4. You have to find some gold coins to balance them against the skull weight. Okay, i can only find 2. Question to Quartermain: Why don´t you use stones instead of gold coins. It doesn´t matter if it is gold or stone. Weight is weight! ... Your NPC character friends are kind of weird sometimes. Sometimes they just do not follow when you leave the scripted speech scene - okay, why would i leave the scripted speech szene in the first place :DThen they suddenly appear again. But just a minor glitch.The game is great, nice graphics, nice story, nice handling. Some minor things that made me go crazy xDDon´t think too much about how they were able to build that stuff (and i do not mean the ruins ;) ), or why you have to put a dynamite in the hock of the crane, shoot at it, and only the part that was 5 meters away from the dynamite explode... simply just don´t think.But in order to ""enjoy"" the game, i recommend you to already open a walkthrought guide like the one available on steam.Its just frustrating if in certain moments the game does not give you hints and therefore you think its a bug in the game.Nevertheless, get it if you can!

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game Deadfall Adventures is a first person action/adventure game developed by The Farm 51 and published by Nordic Games. In Deadfall Adventures you play as James Lee Quatermain, an adventurer who struggles to live up to his legendary adventurer of a grandfather, Allan QuatermainQuatermain's new job is to escort a US agent called Jennifer Goodwin through an Egyptian temple to find an ancient treasure which will eventually lead you all across the world killing mummies and chasing Nazis and it looks like Deadfall Adventures is inspired by Indiana Jones and Naughty Dog's UnchartedDeadfall Adventures has some good graphics with good visual effects yet some poor character animations. Surprisingly, good puzzles, they are challenging and often take a lot of thinking to solve but never feel too hard and the combat difficulty and puzzle difficulty can be changed independently via the settings menu The game has an Interesting mix of genre with an overall mediocre gunplay apart from an interesting mechanic involving mummies and flashlights which seems to copy Remedy's Alan Wake. There are some cool and pretty big locations with lots of hidden collectibles to findThere is a relatively wide variety of weapons with a good variety of enemies to fight however they can become rinse and repeat nearing the end of the game and there are some great atmospheric settings in the gameSurprisingly, Deadfall Adventures performs well on high settings with little to no framerate drops with simple controls. However, all of the humour in the game is very cheesy and cringy, and I hardly laughed at the supposed 'funny' dialogueDeadfall Adventures does suffer with bland and terrible voice acting and I noticed a fair few typos and occasionally missing words in the subtitlesThere is an uninteresting story based around uninteresting characters taking references to other better movies and games such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and the Uncharted series and the game is riddled with bugs and glitchesThe puzzle hints are almost entirely useless and the checkpoints are few and far between. As mentioned previously, Deadfall Adventures suffers with some very clunky animationsDespite some issues I had fun playing Deadfall Adventures with its good graphics, good puzzles and its interesting genre combination. If you're a fan of Indiana Jones and Uncharted style of things then I suggest you pick this one up while it's on sale however not at full price... RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Nice game, but there are certain situations were you want to hit a sandbag - at least i wanted to do it.4 Examples:1. There is a door. You go near it. It says, ""Maybe dynamit"". You search and find danymite. Back to the door. Place it. It explodes. You go to the door. It will not open.So.... what to do?! Exactly! Instead that the character says ""hm, seems like i need something else to open the door"", he just says nothing (at least in my case). So you have to guess what the developer might thought about that. The problem: I already had a bug in the beginning of the game (3 symbols in the ground, you had to step on them).Now, i m not sure if this is a bug too or not.Just let the character tell that he need something else.2. Same thing, different place. There is a vent you have to pull. But in order to do that you have to pull another one to get rid of the hot steam at the first one.You did that but when you want to pull the first one again, you get damage. No hint what to do - at least in my case.Again, i had a bug in the beginning. So this might be another bug - if the character would tell you that he would need something else again i would not thinking about a bug and try to restart again and again.3. You are in a jungle. There is a treasure that is just a meter away from you. But you cannot grab it - also the space between the two status is big enough for you.So you wander around to find the place to enter to get it. The problem, as long as you do not have ""dynamite"" on you, you will not get the hint / information ""Press [x] to place"". And this time the character does not say ""maybe dynamite"". So, you are left guessing again - at least i was.4. You have to find some gold coins to balance them against the skull weight. Okay, i can only find 2. Question to Quartermain: Why don´t you use stones instead of gold coins. It doesn´t matter if it is gold or stone. Weight is weight! ... Your NPC character friends are kind of weird sometimes. Sometimes they just do not follow when you leave the scripted speech scene - okay, why would i leave the scripted speech szene in the first place :DThen they suddenly appear again. But just a minor glitch.The game is great, nice graphics, nice story, nice handling. Some minor things that made me go crazy xDDon´t think too much about how they were able to build that stuff (and i do not mean the ruins ;) ), or why you have to put a dynamite in the hock of the crane, shoot at it, and only the part that was 5 meters away from the dynamite explode... simply just don´t think.But in order to ""enjoy"" the game, i recommend you to already open a walkthrought guide like the one available on steam.Its just frustrating if in certain moments the game does not give you hints and therefore you think its a bug in the game.Nevertheless, get it if you can!

												Hi guys,this game is a real gem.You are Indiana Jones under a false name, Quartemain or something, and the adventure begins between the beautiful walls of the ancient Egypt. I visited those place in my life and I can assure the similitude is realistic. Blue merge with the red of the flames in lot of dungeons and enemies are russian soldier or old mummies. In this second case is not a zombie boring game like the others, there is often a tactical and funny way to take down lot of enemies, using the environment traps and the flashing light. At last there are the bullets.Music and gameplay are lovely. Action is balanced by medium or simple puzzles, and the result is appreciable, at least by me. If you want just to shoot, buy Painkiller or Serius Sam... here we have a different gameplay. I've taken a lot of screenshot playing this game and this means it look beautiful.And then.. then there is the Carret Level.... love it!Just dare the dust, and play it.Lord Hol Napult's experience: 9/10			"

												Yes, it is a bit old but still the background graphics look nice. Nice mood and the music supports the whole atmosphere.Gametime is around 10h.The shooting mechanics are solid. The enemies are not the most clever guys... for example: if they have to reload they do that on the spot they are standing, which makes them very easy targets. Yet they managed to surprise and kill me a few times.Some of the puzzles i didn't get... but with a bit of randomly trying its easy to solve every puzzle.I really hope the developers make a sequel. They captured the story-style of Quatermain-/Jones very well.			"

												If The Mummy and Alan Wake had sex and Mummy got pregnant she would give birth to this game.And Legend Of Zelda /w Return to Castle Wolfenstein were watching them.			"

												This game isn't as bad as everyone say's, but, it's rather mediocre. Basically Uncharted/Tomb Raider but in First Person view. The game has some fun puzzles and VERY beautiful set pieces, it feels kind of like you're playing an Indiana Jones movie. Definitely a fun game if you're into the genre and like games like Tomb Raider.			"
