												Oh, I cannot recommend this game enough. It was such a lovely adventure, I wish it was at least twice as long! The dialogue never stops being funny, and you'll want to say ""Awhh, Robeeeert""...and pat little Robert on the head every time his clueless behaviour makes you chuckle. And you will laugh. A lot. Puzzles are not incredibly hard, and the hint system provides you with enough info if, for example, you're actually missing an object (oh, pixel hunting :) ). The story is good, the characters are hilarious with great voice-acting, and Robert... well, he's just a sweet little boy who goes on an adventure! I'm hoping for a sequel actually, only cause I loved the main character so very much! Plus, you can sing with your nose! "

												A quirky cartoonish adventure game in the classic adventure game style.Backgrounds are lovely, Character Art is cartoonish but nice. Voice Acting is great and generally Sound is good. Writing is interesting and the dialogue is delightfully ""oddball"". Keep in mind the bizarre nature of the puzzles will require equally bizarre solutions. ""Pixel hunt"" & ""Item Clutter"" is never really an issue (hold Spacebar for hotspots). So yeah, you can brute force your way through quite a bit. The hint system is good because it will give you clues (more specific each subsequent time when used on the same puzzle), and doesn't just hand out answers.This is a quality game at a reasonable price. What isn't to love about this?			"

												I absolutely adored this game. The story and puzzles kept me engaged the whole way through, the humor was generally amusing, and the graphics are lovely. The game manages to convey a setting both grim and whimsical at the same time. The main character, Robert, is very endearing and a breath of fresh air in a genre seemingly dominated by sarcastic, cynical protagonists. He just makes you want to hug him. The puzzles generally felt logical but not overly straightforward, making you think outside the box. Goofy scenarios and imaginative settings are both positives, as well. I was very satisfied with every aspect of this game and especially impressed that it's the developer's first effort.			"

IntroductionThe Inner World is developed by Studio Fizbin and published by Headup Games. Dev team’s first and so far only foray onto Steam. I’d say they managed to offer an interesting game even if it never stands out really. GameplayIt’s a coming-of-age type of story, at least at it’s very beginning. Inner World’s protagonist, is a shy and rather naïve little boy named Robert. He starts this adventure like most video game heroes do, fulfilling errands. A less common element would be that you start by working for the game’s main antagonist. The game’s world, Asposia is a rather intricate fantasy realm in which a force of nature (in our case, wind itself) is used as a leitmotif. For an adventure that is also addressed to younger audiences, Inner World contains satire and pop culture references that will amuse older gamers. As far as its storyline is concerned, this title won’t disappoint. Especially if you’re accustomed to 2D adventures and you can imagine just what sort of odd characters you shall interact with. The other almost classic features of the genre, such as the inventory system and dialogue options are under a familiar interface with the occasional mixing of two components, in order to create another one. What I found intriguing was that even wild combinations seem to work and even when they don’t, you still receive an Achievement for trying. A nice touch indeed, from the developers. Story seems long enough, since I’ve only seen a small part of the map so far. A minor complaint from me, would be related to the way all the in-game items you collect seem to blend in so well with the scenery. You really have to keep an eye out for them and click on every little nook and cranny.The beautiful hand drawn locations and characters clearly show the efforts undertaken by the devs in order to separate from similar titles. And from the artwork perspective, I’d say they accomplished that. Voice acting is more than decent, both in English and in the game’s original language, German. I stuck with English dubs and subs and found no typos or mispronunciations so far. Worth mentioning as well, is the musical score which I found particularly soothing and proper. Pros+ Original storyline, filled with humor+ Intuitive puzzles and a comprehensive hint system+ Steam Achievements & Trading CardsCons- A few dialogues tend to drag on, thus slowing the story down- Items blend in too well with the sceneryResult / Final thoughtsIf you’re looking for a good fantasy adventure that won’t strain you too much, you should give The Inner World a chance. Since it targets a large part of the gamer demographic, it’s ideal even for a novice as well as a veteran of this genre. While I’m not exactly okay with its pricing, I do realize that a lot of effort is being placed into such games, from concept art and down to the skilled voice actors.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.

												A hilarious and adorable adventure game that I will remember fondly as one of my favorite point and click advetnures in some time. Phenomenal voice acting, cute characters, charming dialogue, good puzzles, and just an overall fun experience watching the characters try to save their people. We begin with Robert, an orphaned boy who is being raised by a man named Conroy. Conroy is the ruler of this little world of Asposia, and right away, as you can in all animated tales, we realize that Conroy isn't the nicest of fellows. In fact, he seems like a downright meanie. :P One day while Robert is playing his flute nose (yes, I said flute nose) for Conroy in his favorite 1 note tune, a pigeon that Robert has been playing with as one of his only friends comes in and steals Conroy's necklace and flies off. Robert, being the ever dutiful 'son' goes after it and finds himself down in the city of Asposia with all the peasants for the first time outside the walls of Conroy's castle. His adventure is ready to begin...Robert soon meets residents of Asposia and quickly starts to realize that Conroy may not be the great hero that he was raised to believe he was. Most importantly he meets Laura. A wanted thief, general troublemaker, obvious anti-establishment hero, and the girl of Robert's dreams. Robert is incredibly naive, but falls in love with Laura at first site. She is more worldy and they play off one another fantastically as she teases him and he shows his innocence again and again as a kind and generous boy. Their conversations are great, and Robert is pretty funny no matter how innocent he is. I didn't find any issues with the game UI, or the puzzle mechanics. They are the standard hover over the bottom of the screen to pop up the item menu, with options to drag them to world objects, combine them, etc. Some of the puzzles are a bit strange and take some trial and error of jsut screwing aroudn finding what items interact with things, but overalll they aren't too illogical most of the time. The game has a few loading screens between areas that on my medium level PC took about 3 seconds to load wasn't a problem for me. I had no bugs in the game that I can recall. Certainly nothing that made me stop, although the save system is not one that is the type to be friendly for Achievement hunters. The game can be saved manually, or using auto-saves, BUT you don't have a choice about where you save other than picking a slot for your current game. So you have one save and if it auto-saves and you miss an Achievement you will have to start the game over. So...if 100% Achievements is your goal then you better take a look at some Achievements guides BEFORE starting. There are a few that are full game achievements and a couple of them contradict. One side is really easy and can be gotten with a quick restart early on, but the other requires the full game to be played a certain way so you want to make sure you understand these early on before finding out halfway through you will have to play all the way through again.  Game is probalby anywhere from 6-10 hours long. My playtime is longer because I left the game on for 12 hours one day. :)If you are a fan of point and click adventure games, love games such as the ones made by Daedelic, love cute and adorable characters with phenomenal voice acting, then The Inner World is a fantastic game for you. While this is an Indie studio, and this is their first major game, I consider this adventure game to be as good as any of the Daedelic games I have played. It definitely could be considered as comparable in quality to those. I highly recommend it to any adventure fan. I loved the characters and would love to see more from this studio. Bringing me to this...NOTE: While looking at videos for The Inner World on Youtube I noticed this trailer from 2013 that suggested there might be an animated cartoon coming called 'The Inner World', but I ahve found no other news about it. I would have definitely watched, but it gives you a pretty good idea about the voice acting in the game as it is similar to this cartoon. If anyone knows anything else about this animated series I would be interested. :)

												Big things can sometimes come in unassuming packages, and not all adventures have to feature innovative control schemes or frightening scare tactics. There is still plenty of room for traditional point-and-click games that impress by doing what’s been done so often before, but doing it very well. The Inner World is that kind of game: a classic adventure whose hand-drawn, cartoony art style will appeal to young gamers, but whose humor, story, and puzzles will keep even veterans of the genre entertained as well. In short, it’s a game that the entire family can truly enjoy together.Speaking of big things in small packages, little Robert is a novice at the Wind Temple of Asposia and court musician to Abbott Conroy, its resident wind monk. Robert has spent his whole life sheltered under the watchful eye of Conroy, unaware of the dire straits his world finds itself in. You see, Asposia is a world within a world, surrounded on all sides by rock. Wind inexplicably entering through the three wind fountains has become the hidden world’s life force; without it there's no light, and industry, trade, even Asposia’s very existence would come to a grinding halt.And wind is exactly what’s running out. Years ago, the Basylians – angry wind gods who control the wind fountains – became displeased with the Asposians, and since then they’ve been on a rampage, petrifying all they gaze upon while the wind fountains slowly dry up. Robert isn’t the kind of hero to set out on a grand quest to save his world. Rather, he begins merely by chasing a thieving pigeon into a dirty, trash-choked back alley. Before long, he meets the charismatic Laura, a girl searching for her missing father. Following the cryptic clues he left behind for her, Laura not only believes that her father is still alive somewhere, but that he holds the key to discovering a secret wind fountain. Initially an unwilling participant, Robert is pulled into a tale of civil unrest in his own coming-of-age adventure. And if he plays his cards right, he just might learn how to save the world and impress the girl in the process.Studio Fizbin, newcomer to the adventure scene, has crafted a charming, player-friendly experience. The game sports high presentation values, chiefly in its hand-drawn animation resembling Saturday morning TV cartoons. It eschews realism for a stylized fantasy world filled with creatures that draw their inspiration straight from a child’s storybook. Most resemble crosses between two animals, like the tumble mice that look like miniature-sized sheep, or the monkey-like wooloofs. Even the Asposians themselves sport an imaginative look, their distinguishing feature a striped, pointed nose – all but Robert, whose nose is plain and lined with holes, allowing him to play it like a flute. Playing as Robert, you’ll have a chance to explore the throne room of Conroy’s castle, brave the dangers of  a trap-laden root forest, find an underground laboratory, and uncover the secret of the lost wind fountain.Along with the clean, colorful art style comes painless navigation and an easy-to-use inventory system. Mousing over an object brings up clickable options, generally things like “Look”, “Take” or “Talk to”. The inventory, popping up when the cursor approaches the bottom of the screen, is unobtrusive; click and drag an item where you’d like to use it, or onto another object to combine them. Items in your inventory, as well as possible dialog options during conversations, are visually represented by button-like picture icons. Holding the mouse button down will cause all on-screen hotspots to appear, avoiding the need for pixel hunting and making it a snap to find any vital items you may have missed previously. The audio is equally pleasant, with a catchy title theme that perfectly fits the fantastical world, followed by equally good music throughout the game. Voice acting, however, is more of a mixed bag. Most characters sound fine, like Abbott Conroy’s gruff, authoritative baritone and the plucky, rebellious attitude of Laura, Robert's partner in stirring up civil unrest – wanted for such crimes as chewing gum in public. Several minor characters also work flawlessly, and the narrator’s smooth solemnity was a great choice. On the other hand, a few characters get decidedly too much game-time, their voices grating on the nerves, like Detze, a little boy with the painfully obvious adult male falsetto. The most unfortunate voiceover comes from Robert himself; while his flaccid, wispy lack of authority seems fitting at first, it quickly becomes tedious as even describing objects in the environment sounds like an overwhelming task for him.Perhaps one of the only turn-offs of the game is the sheer amount of dialog to slog through. Not that there are walls of text, but most dialog options require upwards of three or four separate clicks to exhaust completely. Most of these conversations deliver a bit of comedy, fill in some backstory, or simply offer some light-hearted flavor. But anyone who would like to get to the point without starting the same conversation four separate times may get impatient. The Inner World's gameplay does not attempt any innovation, relying instead on the tried-and-true, point-and-click formula. However, the complexity of the inventory puzzles ramps up quite significantly after the first chapter or two, providing a gentle learning curve early on but keeping things challenging in later chapters. Even with their increased difficulty, the puzzles remain logical, and can always be solved with a minimum of trial and error.I quite enjoyed the creativity the designers employed in implementing the puzzles. In one scene it becomes clear that Robert needs to bake something. A recipe is easily procured, but finding an oven, making it work, and gathering suitable ingredients proves to be quite a bit more challenging, involving a solution spread out over various screens, gathering and using other items in unconventional ways in order to finally succeed. Of course, without staples such as flour or sugar, one truly has to think outside the box to make this work.Though each chapter consists of no more than a handful of locations, there are a surprising number of tasks in each segment that must be accomplished before proceeding. Each area typically has a clear goal to accomplish, apparent from the beginning of the chapter, whether unlocking a specific door, retrieving a valuable item, or stopping a piece of machinery. Very few situations, however, have a quick solution. If anything, it feels overwhelming on occasion trying to figure out where to begin sorting through the mess of tasks at hand; sometimes simply discovering what obstacle I was supposed to overcome was enough to set me on the path to resolving it. This was the only time I was ever forced to resort to the hint system.Overall, The Inner World is a stylish old-school, point-and-click adventure, and savoring the world and all its little details should provide plenty of play time. It doesn’t break any new ground – nor does it ever seek to – but what it does it does well. Puzzles are a highlight, advancing in complexity from simple to vexing, and the world itself is sure to become a favorite locale to many who visit it. Warm and colorful, the characters have a way of growing on you, and even some spotty voice acting proves more of an annoyance than a game breaker. If games steeped in darkness and shadows are your thing, or if you’re looking for a fast-paced thrill ride, you'll have to look elsewhere. But if a leisurely coming-of-age tale with a bit of humor for the whole family sounds good, you may well want to take the trip to Asposia. You're very likely to enjoy your stay, and that's not just a lot of hot air.			"

												As modern point and click adventure games go, this one is fairly decent. It's not a mind-blowing experience by any means, but it's definitely not bad either. You play as a guy named Robert who finds himself thrust into a quest to save the world (naturally). Robert is a very naive and unassuming sort of fella, so a lot of the plot and humor centers around his clueless innocence. The story and dialogue is fairly good for the most part, in turns charming, funny and dark. The voice acting is hit or miss, though - mostly it is decent, but a few lines here and there are inexplicably bad (wrong pronunciations, improper emphasis of words, etc). Mechanically, the game also has its ups and downs. Being a point and click game, you would think that the pointing and clicking would be spot-on, but that's not always the case. Sometimes you can't click on things that you should be able to click (though it usually fixes itself in a second or two). Additionally, half of the achievements don't seem to be working properly. However, the developers have started to release patches to fix some of these problems, so a lot of these things may not be issues in the future. Regardless, none of these faults are deal breakers by any means, anyways. The puzzles are fairly standard in adventure game terms. You basically just go around talking to people, picking up objects, and using those objects (or combinations thereof) to solve puzzles and progress further. Thankfully, none of the solutions are overly ridiculous or unintuitive (as is the case with many adventure games), though you will need to really think some stuff through from time to time. Apparently there is also a help system in place if you need it (which I didn't even realize until after finishing the game), so you probably won't ever get stuck for long, if you even get stuck at all. The game is divided into 5 chapters, each of which consists of a self-contained series of puzzles that take place on 3 or 4 ""screens"". Playtime is probably around 7-8 hours or so, give or take. So keep that in mind in terms of how much you are willing to pay. All in all, the game is pretty good. As I said earlier, it is nothing mind-blowing for the genre, but it's a nice experience while it lasts. Probably the worst thing I could say about it (aside from the minor glitches noted above) is that the pacing is very slow. The dialogue in particular seems like it takes foreeeeeeeever sometimes, especially with a main character who is so low-key and slow. The pace may test your patience at times. But if you don't mind that and are into classic adventure games, this is probably worth a look at some point. I would probably recommend waiting for a sale, though, unless you are hardcore into adventure games and need something new to play now.			"

												This was a big surprise for me. I bought the Humble Bundle mostly for VVVVVV and I enjoyed this a lot.It's really charming, has a pretty decent storyline, good puzzles, lovable characters, amazing voice-acting... good in general. Kinda short, but the 6 hours I put into it before finishing it was worth it. Every second. I loved it.I even loved it so much I re-played it just to 100% it.Huge yes! Deserves a lot more sales!			"

												A really interesting game! This one might be a little long, sorry guys!I tend to be very on or off with point and clicks, It doesn't happen very often that i get into a game of this genre, don't get bored half way through, and actually manage to get to the end of it.The tendency with this genre for me is that if they don't flow well enough, if i get stuck on obscure item combinations (which happens a lot with point and clicks) or if it's just not interesting enough, i'll give up and not bother going back to it. This is one point and click game however that i am happy to say that not only could i actually bare to get through it, but it's actually a really good game. It's been the best point and click game i have played since the Deponia series, which i adored.In ways, this game reminded me a little of that series. I guess in just style and art. I was actually somewhat convinced whilst playing that it might be by Daedalic Entertainment, but alas it's not!Admittedly when i first started playing this, i thought it was quite slow (maybe i was just in a particularly impatient mood that day?). The dialog seemed like it was paced too slowly and i was generally dreading the trek ahead to completing this game. Although I'm glad to say i changed my mind very quickly with that one.The story is very inventive and i found it quite interesting. The game was fun to play through and the ending was definitely not disappointing. I think i can safely say that it's not the plot twist of the century, but it's not entirely predictable either. Either way it was great to see things unfold and i loved the creativity and humor involved.In terms of characters, I love them. There are some very lovable characters in this game. Including our main star Robert. A well mannered, polite, silly and somewhat naive little Asposian. The graphics are nice. It's very soft, light and nice on the eyes. A light-hearted, hand-drawn and cartoon-like style. With that said, i did have a few problems with crashing/freezing. Sometimes the loading screen between chapters just wouldn't load. It was usually fine because the game tends to autosave before the ""end of chapter"" cutscene. So you don't really lose anything, but it's still a minor annoyance having to reboot the game. I found that if you tended to not move or click anything whilst the cutscene was playing or it was trying to load, it'd usually load fine. If you pressed buttons and clicked your mouse, that's when it tended to have a hard time and freeze.That being the only negative thing out of the way, back to the positive stuff!The help system in this  is quite good. I usually try not to use hints whenever i can, but being stuck on something for a long while gets a bit frustrating. I was quite impressed with the hint system, I wanted to see how many hints it would give you and how obvious they'd be. It gives you a few little nudges in the right direction before just spelling it out to you. Plus, you still don't get it? It'll spell it out to you even more blatantly. Literally to the point of ""Go pick this thing up over there, and use it on this"".Lastly, achievements!This one is pretty easy to complete 100% and i think my method for doing so was a decent way of doing it. I basically started a game file (it allows you up to 3), I played through a chapter, then went back to the main menu and started a second game for missed achievements throughout each chapter. Every time i would complete a chapter in my main save, i'd go back to the secondary save to complete it again whilst getting any missed achievements. The chapters aren't too long and once you know what you are doing going back and getting the missables in a second game file isn't as tedious as it sounds. There is one lonesome guide for this game that details ""missable achievements"" you can either read the names/descriptions and try to figure yourself how to get them, or you could just use the guide to know what to do. (In my opinion it's fairly easy to figure out how to get them just from reading the title or description)Also, there are a few achievements that having two saves actually makes it easier. For example, there is one achievement for not using the guide at all and one for using the guide frequently. So either way really, you'd have to play it twice. All in all i really loved this game and i'm glad i decided to have a go with it. If you're a fan of the genre i would definitely recommend it to you. TL;DR :  It's great, seriously. The story is inventive, it's fun and humorous. If you are a fan of the genre then definitely try it.  "

												This game is a gem of point-and-click adventures. The hand-crafted backgrounds of the world really give the whole game a great personality (even if the character art was a bit too simple for the beautiful scenery). The storyline is creative and engaging enough that I couldn't stop playing and made it through the game in about 8-9 hours over three days. Currently playing through it for the achievements and making sure I find all the clever jokes buried inside.8.5/10, am playing again.			"

												I fell in love with this game as soon as I laid my eyes on the intro cutscene: so cute, so lovely, and so funny. Unfortunately my heart was broken not too long after.The good: main character is lovable and a great vehicle for humor; great artwork; original, quirky setting; adorable critters with criminally too little screentime, like Peck, and the Gorfs have a welcome Adams-esque touch; the voicework solid and the music very nice, although the wind theme is oddly reminiscent of Oldboy's waltz (not complaining); the built-in hint system is extensive (luckily!).The bad: I'd be hard pressed to name another recent adventure game so badly affected by moon logic: the gameplay hardly ever takes off, probably an attempt to squeeze length out of the assets. It's a mobile port, mostly workable, but leaving a room/location brings up a loading screen which is unbelievably slow, like the transitions in the UI. The story is functional at best, giving most characters some sort of motive, but is ultimately weak. Playing as Laura, in Chapter 2, she's just so whingy! The animations are far from smooth and the cutscenes often are lacking in detail. The translation, by virtue of being generally of good quality, makes the dozen or so non sequiturs stand out.Recommended? tough call. On one side, it would have maybe worked better as a short animated film, for (too) much of my playing time I just wished I had watched a Let's Play instead. That's how miserable the puzzles made me.OTOH these folks clearly have talent, and I'd like them to make more games.			"

The Inner World is a point & click adventure game. Its story is set in the fantasy world of Asposia. Asposia is a world surrounded by earth. Air is blown into Asposia through only a few large holes. Each of these holes is guarded by a wind monk. Robert lives in a wind monastery with one of the wind monks. He's treated like a doormat and has never left the monastery. By accident, he plunges through a garbage chute and finds himself in a world he knows very little of. What will he discover?The graphics of The Inner World are hand-drawn and cartoonish in style. The world of Asposia looks pretty nice and full of life. The characters look ugly but that's a style the developers chose. I'm sure they didn't think they created the most beautiful animated characters ever, but they consciously chose a simple, cartoonish look for their characters, which fits the world and the story they wanted to show us.The game is German in origin but the way it was transitioned to the English version is impressive. This shows in two major ways: The voice acting is top-notch. The voice actor of Robert, the protagonist, manages to capture Robert's innocense and naivety perfectly. The humour did not get lost in translation, as is often the case. The Inner World is even genuinely funny at times. It's not often that a computer game can make me laugh out loud a couple of times, and makes me giggle a few more times on top of that.The difficulty of The Inner World is challenging enough but the solutions to the puzzles are always logical, so the game never becomes frustratingly hard and it never makes you want to look up a walkthrough. To help you play through the game more easily, you can hold the mouse button to see all the objects Robert can interact with. Should you find yourself stumped, you can open a help menu and get a hint on what to do next. If you still don't know how to proceed, you can ask to get another hint. And so on, until the solution is pretty much spelled out to you.The Inner World has 7 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 4 while running the game. Of the 23 Steam Achievements some are storybound and unmissable, but other achievements are optional and very much missable. These missable achievements show a lot of creativity on the developers' part, as they are often rewarded for trying out alternative solutions or at least experimenting with the items you collect and objects in the environment.

Some parts of the game was tricky and others real easy, I think it was balanced in how hard and easy it was. Dont skip this one, try it out!			"

												Great art, characters and interesting/unique story. One of the better point-and-click games released in the past year or so.The puzzles did occasionally get convoluted but by and large, progress can be made with a little experimenting.Would highly recommend to any adventure game fans.

												I've played the first 2 deponia series and also Broken Age. Now onto the inner world and i found this game so much more enjoyable than the deponia series. I also preferred this game over broken age. Eventhough broken age has better graphics and illusration but I was more captivated in this game than broken age. I guess its cause broken age has more of a serious tone? Inner world was funnier and quirkier, therefore i never found any part of the game boring. The storyline is good, i enjoyed clicking on all the speech bubbles to hear more about the story. Puzzles were logical and understandable not weird and random (unlike some other puzzle games where u randomly just put things together hoping it'll work) Illustration is simple yet attractive, alot of different scenes. The game lasted quite long hence i felt like it was value for money. Overall, if u like funny, cute adventure games with a cute storyline (and cute characters! e.g. gorf & tumblemouse!) then try out this game! i rly enjoyed it!!			"

Short version: 86%The Inner World is a classic point-and-click adventure game about a strange, alien planet, a meek protagonist who ends up on a world-wide conspiracy, and some old-school hardcore problem solving, all wrapped within a cosy atmosphere.Long version:The Inner World is so far the largest game released by German independent developer Studio Fizbin. It is the kind of point ‘n’ click adventure that doesn’t shy away from ludicrous puzzles, but gives you a really unique storytelling experience in return.It takes place inside a world where natural laws differ greatly from ours. An alien planet which seems quite “human” in some respects, but different enough to leave the door open for creativity, imagination, and overall good writing.You play a very naïve, shy hero, whose day starts off with a seemingly small accident, but he soon finds himself in a revolution against an oppressing religious dictator for the control of the most precious commodity: air. Don’t expect the usual story development though, because the plot has a few clever tricks along the way.The cast is quite small, but even the supporting members are enjoyably memorable. The voice actors do a decent job, but nothing spectacular.As an adventure game, it is moderately difficult. The item usage follows a really weird and twisted logic, but it is not completely impossible. (Plus it has a step-by-step hint system as backup.) Thanks to this, the play time can easily be pushed over 6-7 hours, which is fairly decent for this price category.			"

												This brought back the fun, interesting dialogue, characters and stories of old Point and Click adventure games and gave me a healthy dose of nostaliga and was a real joy to play. It's just a shame it's so damn short compared to the titles I remember from the older days.HighlightsThe writing, characters, world and art-style are all important things for Point & Clicks, and The Inner World gets all of them right. Due to the short length of the game the characters don't really develop, but they mostly have enough backstory and care of writing to have more than one dimension. They all have reasons for doing what they're doing and even short interactions like helping the character involve a motivation of some kind that you don't see written into too many games these days.The world is rich and interesting and again, thought and care and good writing have gone hand in hand to create a diverse landscape with enough character to feel immersive. The art-style is friendly but layered enough to add time and history, and importance where it's due.Mistakes and AnnoyancesMy biggest complaint with The Inner World is the short length and lack of content. Although it's well written and shines as an upbeat story, with only 3 memorable characters and a couple of protagonists and a handful of areas it just doesn't have enough content to explore and ultimately feels rather shallow. As a result it's good value for money when on sale, but is hard to recommend at full price because of the low level of content to explore.Some may find this far too easy, and at times I think it feels a little too casual, as though you're merely exploring an interactive artbook rather than solving puzzles and furthering the story with gameplay, but these moments are sparse and unless you have a hard time investing in the story or characters, or don't enjoy the writing then you'll find plenty of joy in just exploring what's here, nevermind solving the puzzles.Other than that The Inner World really doesn't have anything to criticise. There are a couple of sections where it's not particularly intuitive on how to progress, and the age old Point-and-Click problem of disjointed solutions becomes apparant, but these are mitigated by the wonderful hint system and become easy to overlook.Perhaps you could complain the small extra content game unlocked after playing isn't fun and essentially pointless, but that's hardly a compelling reason against buying the game.RecommendationsPriced on Steam at £11.99/$14.99/13.99€, The Inner World clocks in at a typical 7-8 hours of gameplay, and has enough charm and dimensions to warrant an additional playthrough or two down the line. It's very fairly priced if you don't mind the short length and goes on sale for up to 85% off, which is a bloody bargain.* An animated series based on the game is/was planned, a demo of which is available here

												The Inner World tells the story about a world inside a giant ball of dirt and how the wind stopped blowing as the wind gods grew angry with the world and began to turn people to stone. Their only hope lies in an evil mastermind who bargains with the wind gods daily. When his naive and unassuming apprentice, Robert, accidentally loses his master's pendant, he goes outside of the palace for the first time in his life to find it. What follows is a hilarious, fascinating, and clever point-and-click game about Robert and wanted criminal Laura trying to save the world.All the basic polish is fanatstic; the music is great and suits the mood perfectly, the art style is superb and excellently captures the essence of the seedy underground you'll be exploring for most of the game. Every character is completely unique, with the exception of the guards, which are supposed to be carbon copies of each other, the dialogue is extremely well-written, and there are underlying themes throughout that are both morbidly fascinating and innocently interesting. The puzzles are extremely clever and intuitive, requiring you to think both outside and inside the box. You may need to collect an arrow not for a knife or weapon, but for the tail that can be used to clean out a pipe.The games' biggest downfall is its length and pacing. There are only five chapters, and I beat the game in about eight hours with most of the achievments. The way it was set up, with the underlying mysteries, strange minds of the supporting cast, and overall themes, it felt like an adventure that should have lasted at least ten chapters, which would also have left room for some characters to be developed. You only get to play as Laura one time during the entire game, and her snarky comments and conversations were perfect for multiple uses during a game like this. In fact, it almost feels cut off; you accidentally land in the bad guy's lair after falling through a hole in the third chapter, which brings an anticlimactic feel to the whole experience, like you were cheated out of a longer game. Near the end, everything kind of plateaus out; the puzzles are suddenly rather easy, and the end comes up much more quickly than expected. It was, admittedly, a disappointing end to a great game, and makes me want to beg for a sequel where I can properly explore this fascinating world.In the end, The Inner World is a brilliant little game with clever puzzles and an intriguing story that just ends a little too early. If you like point-and-click adventure titles, don't pass this one up.			"

												A traditional point and click adventure game. Really atmospheric (with a slightly dark-ish tone) with some good humor here and there, accompanied by a great OST and the occasional weird puzzles and inventory item combinations.The hint system is awesome, though. It lets you know of the current objectives and only reveals the solutions to each and every puzzle step by step, so you can still figure things out yourself without getting stuck and feeling frustrated.I wasn't impressed by the English voiceover, though - it could've been much better.All in all, a more-than-decent adventure game. Looking forward to the sequel next year!			"

												I saw someone compare this to The Whispering World and...wow. Not at all. This game is actually good and the main character is not an annoying little turd.Fantastic voicework and dialogue. Flutenose had me cracking up through the entire game with his innocent yet unsettling commentary.  Loved the artwork. Cute and unique. Puzzles were difficult but not so difficult I could not figure them out on my own (or at least randomly click my way there). Great story. The mythos is unique and I'd love further instalments delving into this. Good characters. I LOVE FLUTENOSE. He's such an adorable little psycho. Laura could be grating, especially when she wouldn't help out with puzzles.My only negatives (besides Laura) was that the game was occasionally buggy (not gamebreaking, though) and there could've been a longer ending (ending is a bit abrupt).This is the type of game where you'd want a sequel, but you don't know how it could compare to the first. 9/10			"

Beatiful, but only 'solid' adventure game'The Inner World' is a pretty good game, but far from being great or especially memorable.Pros: Art is great, with a lot of heart put into it. Nice sense of humour, some of it was quite an 'adult' for a game stylized for kids Laura is a very well written characterCons: Plot is not engaging at all - story could be much better There are almost no puzzles in this game - 99% of time you just use items on something, or combine them with one another Some achievements are given for doing some things wrong, and if you miss them, you must usually repeat a chunk of a gameAs mentioned in a title, it's a solid game. If you like adventure genre, don't hesitate to get it on sale.			"

												Played through twice. Once to complete and once again to get the achievements I'd missed. Second playthrough took about an hour and a half with me skipping all dialogue and cutscenes, the rest of the time was spent going through puzzles and watching loading screens. Actually that made me notice a lot of the puzzles had a lot of wandering back and forth between locations but that's a minor criticism. Otherwise the short playtime is to be expected when you already know the solutions to all the puzzles, so it shows there is a decent amount of content there. I'd estimate 6 to 10 hours depending on how quick you are on the uptake.First playthrough I completed with know guides or help from the hint system. I did scratch my head occasionally but it's not an exceptionally hard point and click adventure. The majority of the puzzles make logical sense and most the time you know what you want to do and the challenge is more in finding the right items to do it. If you are stuck it usually means you need to go back and talk to someone now you know more or you just missed and item in another area. Holding down the left mouse button shows all the hot spots for objects you can interact with on the screen so thankfully pixel hunting is not a barrier like the old days of P&C. If you do get stuck there's an in game help system that tells you what your goals are and can get successively more detailed hints on what to do next from, so you still wont need a guide to help you complete it.The art style is styalised as you can see from the screenshots above. Appeal comes down to personal opinion. The quality of the art assets is adequate for what they are trying to convey. I didn't find myself not knowing what something was when I looked at it.Sound wise the voice acting is decent enough, soundFX are adequate to indicate what they are and the music sets the mood without been noteworthy enough to get in the way of your attention. In otherwords it all serves it's purpose.The story is well written and very original. There's a decent amount of lore to give depth to this unique universe and it is delivered with good pacing to keep the mysteries unfolding all the way to the end. Characters are well designed, you like and contempt them as appropriate and as such feel satisfied when they get what they deserve (good or bad). Dialogue is amusing whenever it's not supposed moving. I would say it's laugh out loud funny but I went through most the game with a bemused smile. The emotional drama isn't exactly gripping, in spite of it's content it doesn't feel super dark and gripping or a tear jerker like some other games in the genre (try some deadalic titles like chains of satinav of whispered world for that). It's interesting, it walks a tight right where you do feel sympathy for the characters without been devastated by the tragedy constantly befalling them. In other worlds it's pretty light hearted if still a little grim at times. Loading times aside (they are short but still noticeable enough to annoy you when you realise you have to backtrack because you forgot something) my biggest criticism would have to be stability. Very occasionally the cut scene animations didn't play correctly when completing a puzzle (no impact on gameplay you just miss out on the visual) and the game would periodically crash, I'd say you can expect it to do so 3-5 times between the begging of the game and completion. Thankfully the game autosaves after literally everything you do so you never lose any progress. Another example of how it's not super polish but enough work was put in to make sure things are good enough to preform to resonable expectations.  In summary this is a solid addition to the genre and at the end of the day the game left me hoping for a sequel to be released in the future, which in my book is as solid a recommendation as any.

												Beautifully drawn, puzzle-heavy, cartoonish adventure game with sympathetic cast, intriguing story and quite unique mythos.The gameplay is standard point'n'clicking: You can either inspect (a magnifying glass), pick up (a hand), or interact (gears) with hotspots. Left-clicking brings up a ""radial menu"" with the inspect option on left and either interact or pick up option on right. This seems a bit clunky and wasteful considering right-clicking serves no purpose. You open the inventory by moving the cursor to the lower end of the screen and use items via the radial menu or dragging'n'dropping.Graphics of the milieus in this game are top-notch. For some reason the developer decided to put less effort into character art, and they generally look like they were drawn in MS Paint. After the initial shock this didn't bother me personally, but as someone rightfully pointed out it makes the characters seem a bit disconnected from the surroundings. Animation is satisfactory.Sound is good, and the naivety of the protagonist is quite cutely presented by the voice actor. Rest of the cast is up to par as well. There was one character in the game whose voice I couldn't bear, but it sort of suited him anyhow. Music is mostly ambient and forgettable. The story and atmosphere are moody. Don't let the cute exterior fool you, there are some dark elements in the story and characters. Some of it felt borderline psychotic and rather morbid, which I enjoyed. Predictably, attempts at humor are made, but I only found myself chuckling a few times, so it was mostly a miss in my case. Dialogue was for most part pretty standard stuff compared to other point'n'click adventures, at times good, and on a few occasions a bit too lengthy. The world is imaginative and the game has a lot of personality, and the characters were generally likeable and/or relatable on some level. Writing felt a bit rushed toward the end, but I felt the story came to a closure. Puzzles are of varying quality. They mostly felt logical, and some of them were quite clever, but sometimes I felt like things were set up badly and I needed to do things in some arbitrary order or fashion to achieve the end result although I had already figured out a/the logic. There is a help system if you get stuck.The game spans five chapters and progression happens within constraints of a handful of [scrollable] screens at a time, restricting problem-solving to a rather narrow area and assets. This means less exploration and more fiddling with objects and talking to characters. Technically, the game had one small annoyance: Sometimes when you'd interact with an object or trigger an event there is a noticeable pause before the character responds, similar to how older games used to stall for a few seconds to load an audio file from CD-ROM. It is annoying enough to warrant a mention here, but doesn't come close to affecting my opinion of the game on the whole.The main complaint - as often is the case with these games - is that I wish the game was lengthier. I could have gone on for full 10 chapters at a slightly slower tempo or (preferably) with a more branching storyline. In any case, if there ever is a sequel I will definitely be getting it to see what more is going on in Asposia. "

												A really interesting game! This one might be a little long, sorry guys!I tend to be very on or off with point and clicks, It doesn't happen very often that i get into a game of this genre, don't get bored half way through, and actually manage to get to the end of it.The tendency with this genre for me is that if they don't flow well enough, if i get stuck on obscure item combinations (which happens a lot with point and clicks) or if it's just not interesting enough, i'll give up and not bother going back to it. This is one point and click game however that i am happy to say that not only could i actually bare to get through it, but it's actually a really good game. It's been the best point and click game i have played since the Deponia series, which i adored.In ways, this game reminded me a little of that series. I guess in just style and art. I was actually somewhat convinced whilst playing that it might be by Daedalic Entertainment, but alas it's not!Admittedly when i first started playing this, i thought it was quite slow (maybe i was just in a particularly impatient mood that day?). The dialog seemed like it was paced too slowly and i was generally dreading the trek ahead to completing this game. Although I'm glad to say i changed my mind very quickly with that one.The story is very inventive and i found it quite interesting. The game was fun to play through and the ending was definitely not disappointing. I think i can safely say that it's not the plot twist of the century, but it's not entirely predictable either. Either way it was great to see things unfold and i loved the creativity and humor involved.In terms of characters, I love them. There are some very lovable characters in this game. Including our main star Robert. A well mannered, polite, silly and somewhat naive little Asposian. The graphics are nice. It's very soft, light and nice on the eyes. A light-hearted, hand-drawn and cartoon-like style. With that said, i did have a few problems with crashing/freezing. Sometimes the loading screen between chapters just wouldn't load. It was usually fine because the game tends to autosave before the ""end of chapter"" cutscene. So you don't really lose anything, but it's still a minor annoyance having to reboot the game. I found that if you tended to not move or click anything whilst the cutscene was playing or it was trying to load, it'd usually load fine. If you pressed buttons and clicked your mouse, that's when it tended to have a hard time and freeze.That being the only negative thing out of the way, back to the positive stuff!The help system in this is quite good. I usually try not to use hints whenever i can, but being stuck on something for a long while gets a bit frustrating. I was quite impressed with the hint system, I wanted to see how many hints it would give you and how obvious they'd be. It gives you a few little nudges in the right direction before just spelling it out to you. Plus, you still don't get it? It'll spell it out to you even more blatantly. Literally to the point of ""Go pick this thing up over there, and use it on this"".Lastly, achievements!This one is pretty easy to complete 100% and i think my method for doing so was a decent way of doing it. I basically started a game file (it allows you up to 3), I played through a chapter, then went back to the main menu and started a second game for missed achievements throughout each chapter. Every time i would complete a chapter in my main save, i'd go back to the secondary save to complete it again whilst getting any missed achievements. The chapters aren't too long and once you know what you are doing going back and getting the missables in a second game file isn't as tedious as it sounds. There is one lonesome guide for this game that details ""missable achievements"" you can either read the names/descriptions and try to figure yourself how to get them, or you could just use the guide to know what to do. (In my opinion it's fairly easy to figure out how to get them just from reading the title or description)Also, there are a few achievements that having two saves actually makes it easier. For example, there is one achievement for not using the guide at all and one for using the guide frequently. So either way really, you'd have to play it twice. All in all i really loved this game and i'm glad i decided to have a go with it. If you're a fan of the genre i would definitely recommend it to you.			"

Some are quite abstract while others are straight forward...Esque.HINTS: The in-game hints are beyond helpful when you are stuck (but they get so specific after a few clicks that it kinda ruins the fun, so click once or twice but then solve it by your damn self! lol)CONS: THE DIAAAAAAAAALOOOOOOOGE TAAAAAAAKES FOOOOOREEEEVEEER and you HAVE to sit or 'click' through it to progress. In my opinion, there is too much dialogue but I clicked through it and, after awhile, it didn't both me at all.UN-FUN FACT: When you get stuck, hearing the character tell you you are wrong EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. made me rage once and I had to stop playing for a cool minute.FUN FACT: The voice of the lead 'Robert' sounds just like Rocco from, 'Rocco's Modern Life' GREAT POINT & CLICK ADVENTURE PUZZLE GAME!!  4 out of 5 stars!! ^_^ <3			"

												A very fun game about a little ""Flutenose"" named Robert.The game has a lot of humor in it and the puzzles are clever.But after you finished the game it's nothing more to do and you now all the puzzles so that's pretty sad.So here's my advice: after you finished the game, just wait until you forgotten all the puzzles(a month or something) and then you can play it again.

												The Inner World is a nice and nostalgic point-and-click adventure. Its strength points are a fine gameplay, nice characters, an original setting and wonderful moments of pure humor: some dialogues will really make you roll laughing. Faced some async issues between video and speech in cinematics - this won't affect your game experience, anyway. Recommended for those who want to have a break from all those frantic games.			"

												Roger ""Flute donger"" Conrod the 3rd is the last of his dynasty, a secretive group who controlled the lifeblood of the world from the shadows, until being assassinated nearly to the last in a violent upheaval staged by Libertarians lead by none other than Rand Paul himself. Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney lends his brave voice to this inspirational tale, and demonstrates once and for all that his talents extend beyond good-sense politics and down home sensibilities. I buy all these adventure games thinking this will be finally the time I like them, but in reality, aside from a few instances (Like the recent notable exception of The Fall, which was tremendously excellent) I always end up getting frustrated with adventure game logic. Despite that, there's an integrated help system which I abused liberally if I was stuck on what two items to glue together for more than 45 seconds, and got to enjoy a nicely animated and decently written story with cute voice acting. You will like this game a lot, if you enjoy traditional adventure games.			"

												Really enjoyed this adventure game quite a bit. The game reminds me of Daedalic Entertainment titles such as The Whispered World and The NIght of The Rabbit. Characters are well written and in my opinion voiced exceptionally well. The story is fairly unique and paced quite well. The dialouge hits serious and quirky/funny tones. It isn't a very long game, like most indie adventures, or even games like the Monkey Island Series, but that doesn't mean its not worth the price.The art style is unique as well. I really enojyed the hand drawn aspect of the game and the colours really set the atmosphere. Cutscenes are well done and frequent. They are cool and help carry the store. Puzzles for the most part are pretty intuitive and fun to complete.If you enjoyed The Whispered World, The Night of The Rabbit, Deponia Series, Monkey Island Series, Satinav/Memoria, etc. than you should definately pick this up. Also the soundtrack is totally worth it!			"

Studio Fizbin is to be commended on making fantastic game,The game has a wonderful, jagged, hand-drawn style,and the Voice work is excellent.Roberts and Laura’s interactions  are both hilarious and, precious.The game has Numerous tricky puzzles!If you’re trying to figure out what it is that makes The Inner World so satisfying, you’re really not going to be able to pick any one thing. The story, graphics, and gameplay are all well made, but it’s the sum of the parts that synthesizes The Inner World into the charming gem that it is. "

The Inner World offers an elegantly simple adventure set in a pleasantly peculiar little world. Its immediately charming ambiance and art style lend a unique tone to the reasonably enjoyable story, where every detail is nicely executed but falls short of impressing.Your character, Robert, is strangely charming in his naive and very literal approach to everything. He does not understand metaphors and is relatively dimwitted with a knack for stating the obvious. Your eventual partner has a far more confrontational and action-driven persona. Most characters you'll meet are actually quite original and rather silly.Decent writing and delightful vocal performances, with strangely slow-paced and very articulated dialogue, make the game actually sort of relaxing to hear. Coupled with the reassuring absence of failure, it is quite pleasant if somewhat unexciting.The game behaves as you'd expect in a point-and-click, with an overall high level of polish, except in a few scenes where the audio sometimes cut abruptly at inappropriate times. Nice, clean interface, particularly with good iconography used for all dialog choices. Technically very stable.""That's just a random guess, isn't it?""Puzzle requirements and solutions unfold naturally, except in the final chapter, which I found a bit more obtuse than the rest. Situations are all a bit absurd but nearly always made sense within the given context. My interest nevertheless progressively dwindled once the novelty wore off and the plot turned into a more conventional cliché.Funny achievements reward failed creative attempts or silly solutions. One of the better uses of achievements I've seen in any type of game, they complement the humour nicely.Serviceable but unremarkable cutscenes are directly layered over the background panels for a nice, dynamic integration. The hand-drawn animation has style but the frame rate is not very smooth. Also, English signs do not match spoken dialogue and remain in German during cutscenes, but that's just nitpicking.If this game were a meal, it'd be the sort that fills you up sufficiently to satisfy the hunger but would not cut the craving for truly delicious food. There's really nothing to dislike about The Inner World. It's a fun, simple game in the tradition of the genre, built on solid foundations that will hopefully spawn a better sequel.			"

Pros:+ Great story with lots of emotional twists+ Original fictive universe+ Strong yet logical puzzles+ Bold design+ Memorable unique characters with wonderful voice acting+ Positive atmosphere with cool comments from the protagonist+ Music that adds to the immersionVerdict:If I’d rate games, this would be a 10/10 case.

												One of the best adventure/puzzle game I´ve ever played. I didn´t have this much fun since I played ""Monkey Island"" or ""Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis"". Don´t get biased by the negatives comments, this game is awesome. I played for more then 5 hours in my android phone, and I´m currently downloading it on steam to play it again in a big screen! :)Loved all the thematic, the scenes and the story are genius, the puzzles can be a bit confusing but still easy if you get to think about how things would work in a ""fantastic"" world. If you ever get stuck, you can ask for hints, I didn´t like to have hints so I seldom use them only when I was running crazy about how to get stuff to work.In summary, please do buy this game, you will not regret it.For Devs:PLEASE MAKE MORE GAMES LIKE THIS, I'LL WILL BUY THEM ALL <3 :smilecyto:			"

												Of the games that I've discovered on Steam so far, this has been by far one of the best. It's vastly amusing, simple yet thoughtful, charming in its graphics and character voicing, and most importantly to me, the puzzles are LOGICAL. After playing Deponia, which was challenging even with a detailed walkthrough, the logical thought pattern of ""well, this doesn't hit the bad guy in the jaw like I was hoping, but it is going under his nose, and I happen to have knockout drops, therefore when it passes underneath he will fall unconscious onto the button"" is very refreshing. it's nice to be able to figure out some problems on my own before turning to the in-game hints. Those hints, by the way, are super nice because they'll not only give you pointers to the logical procession of seemingly unconnected tasks, but the hints are arranged in a way that you can click through a couple, just enough to get the idea without it expressly telling you, without feeling like you've totally given up on all problem solving on your own.Robert is a very sweet likeable character, though Laura was a bit of a drag at times. The plot was engaging, and had a few unexpected twists. Very rarely do I get engrossed enough in a game to feel worried or horrified for the characters, but this one sucked me in and I was genuinely rooting for Robert and Laura long before the end.That being said, I would also recommend this game solely because of the hilarious progression of the Conrad puppet.A must-have game for those who like a casual point-and-click. And also laughing a little. And mocking Conrad puppets,10/10			"

												As far as Point & Click adventures go, this is a little gem that must be experienced to appreciate. It has charming, wacky characters and suitably bizarre little environment built to showcase the story and gameplay. The puzzles are fairly simple and fun to solve and it has it's own built in hinting system, which truth be told I took advantage of more than once, but got an achievement for it. :D The humor is sweet and innocent, but funny nonetheless. Voice acting is great and most, with the exception of Laura and a few others, are spoken with British accenting in the English version. There were some minor glitches and one or two crashes, but overall the game seems pretty stable. I would recommend it for those that like the genre and I think it would be a fun one to play with the kids or just let them loose on it themselves. My rating:  8/10  :)			"

It does not reply to any input then. After the cutscene between level one and two the screen turns black, music plays and the curser is on the screen.  It again does not reply to any input then.This seems to be a known issue. Updating Adobe applications didn't help. I was not able to find a savegame after the error.Please remove the Linux version out of the shop. That is not fair. And please provide a savegame after every cutscene for others that want to play this game.			"

												There's nothing about The Inner World that players can’t enjoy. The story is motivating, puzzles are fun solving, and characters are as lively as they can get. The intensity level of the game, however, is the only factor that can hold this game back. Due to the sluggish nature of point-and-click games, it’s easy for players to get diverted from the intensity of the story. Having said that, compared to all of the chapters, the end of the game feels rather shortened and contradicted. The intensity level bakes throughout the four chapters and suddenly delivers the unexpected in the finale.  Full Review[www.noobfeed.com].			"

												It's a really cute point&click adventure.All of the puzzles are feasible (and if not, there is a help system).Quite a few humorous lines can be found, from puns to suggestions.It's fun to play and to watch. It includes nice cut scenes and a beatifully drawn world and characters.Best of all? The main character is a cookie-loving guy named Robert ;-]			"

												Κάπως έτσι ξεκίνησε, προ 3 ετών, την άκρως επιτυχημένη πορεία της η Daedalic Entertaiment. Με ένα πρωτότυπο, ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον, πλούσιο σε προκλήσεις και αρτιότατο σε τεχνικό επίπεδο παραμυθάκι, που είχε ως πρωταγωνιστή ένα πλάσμα που άλλοι το αγάπησαν και άλλοι το αντιπάθησαν. Αυτό ακριβώς έρχεται να κάνει με τη σειρά της και η Studio Fizbin. Μπορεί το παιχνίδι της να μη καταφέρει να έχει τον ίδιο αντίκτυπο με την παρθενική δημιουργία της έτερης Βαυαρικής εταιρείας το 2010, αλλά σίγουρα την τοποθετεί με το καλημέρα στο χάρτη των ικανών και αξιόλογων developers, στρέφοντας τη ματιά και την προσοχή μας πάνω της, κάνοντάς μας να προσμένουμε να δούμε τι έχει να μας προφέρει στη συνέχεια. Πρώτο δείγμα λοιπόν, απολύτως θετικό!http://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/the-inner-world-pc-review "

												This is a cute, all-ages-friendly, point and click adventure game. The main character leaves his home as the naive protagonist and must work his way up to becoming the hero, along with the help of his friend Laura and her pet pigeon. This is one of those adventure games where it's got a few cute, unique elements, but also it's more like a comic book you can play through. The puzzles are set up in a usual adventure game style, where you have to find and combine some items to make them work. I'll warn you that it's a bit dialog heavy. You have to talk to a lot of characters, so if you're not in the mood to sit through quite a bit of worldbuilding-through-chatting, I'd wait to play this game until you feel more patient. It's not a revolutionary game, but it is fun. I'm happy to have it in my library. The only bad thing is there was one, single puzzle that was impossible for me to solve, because I had already tried that combination of things, but not at the right exact time. Regular adventure game frustrations, you know? It could really have been fixed, I think, but it doesn't ruin the entire game. The thing is, once you talk to someone and they give you all the information they can, or they have said all there is to say in a conversation, that button gets grayed out. You can click it again, but throughout the entire game the character would just repeat the same thing over if you did so. That caused a problem with one of the puzzles. Other than that minor issue, I enjoyed playing this, I found the characters cute (if not a little cliche), and it had some lovely art and a nice world.			"

												Asposia is an interesting place filled with lots of curious characters, in fact it's such an interesting place that by the time the game ends you'll wish for a chance to visit all of it's wind fountains and to know more about it's inhabitants. After all the inner world is a short game, but one you'll probably remember. The story is simple, and perhaps it could work better with a different pace, but it has enough charm and humour to keep you going all the way and even want a little more, Asposia is a curious place after all.The sceneries and characters are well drawn, and the soundtrack fits the game like a glove, but to be honest what really caught my eye were all the details put into the menus and interaction options. Everything is clean and simple while still adding a lot to the world. Nothing seems out of place. I can tell that the developer put a lot of effort (and maybe even some love) into this game and that by it self is enough for me to recommend this game. "

												It's a charming game with a story that will keep you attention for hours, and cute, likeable characters that you will want to learn more about - which is a good thing as it's also rather dialogue heavy. The humour tends to be on the dark side and creates an amusing combination with the protagonist's naivety. Voice acting in the English version is mostly decent, albeit with a few pronunciation inconsistencies and lack of emotion in certain scenes. While a few puzzles are too bizarre even considering the game logic, the overall gameplay is casual. That doesn't stop The Inner World from being really fun to play.			"

												I hoped this game would be a gem, that it would be really fun to explore and sink in to. But I had a hard time connecting with this world! My experience playing, is that this game is really tedious, the main character is quite stupid and pathetic, but still so, he is the one to save the world. It doesn't make al lot of sense. I guess the developers wanted it to be a charming puzzle game, but i can't se how this is any charming at all.. - The dialogs are so tedious and poorly written. Too much dialog, that is not funny or relevant to the gameplay.- The puzzles are not hard, but random and strange.- Voice overs could have been much more fitting, especially Robert. I have tried to give it an honest try several times, with the same outcome every time; after 10 minutes i'm bored playing (or irritated).. I have also tried playing with no sound, that didn't help either. So unfortunatley I had to give up on this one :/			"

												This isn't a bad game really? But it's not a particularly good game either honestably.  Some of the puzzles were just sort of weird but that's a complaint that i think ranges from the puzzle solving ability from person to person.  Things that I can say for sure were not great was the voice acting, some bugs and technical issues, and the story.  The voice acting is the most obvious flaw, with the actors frequently delivering their lines somewhat emotionlessly, and with strange awkward gaps of silence as they speak.  There are some slightly frustrating bugs, sometimes I just couldnt click on anything for a moment, and the load times are not god awful, but games work like movies, where their point is usually to try and draw you into whats unfolding on the screen, to suspend your disbelief and engage in the story, and the loading periods were long enough that it was sort of jarring in that sense.  The world was creative and interesting, the story showed promise in the beginning, but it played out with far too many lame cliches and flat characterizations.  The interaction with Gorfelina and Laura was just so tiring and tedious especially.  The art was cool, the premise was interesting, but right after the game took its first step it was just a strangely boring slow motion fall right onto its face.I'd give it a 6/10			"

												I can't, I actually didn't finished this game because it left me that damn bored that I couldn't finished it. The Story just fails to keep me invested, the main characters are boring as hell, the only good character where the side characters but even only half of it and that is just not enough to keep me invested. Also the grafix, yeah grafix with an X! Well it is drawn quite well the background are pretty nice but the sequenzes just come of very chopy the musik always stops and it comes always out of paste and it happens way to often. Also many animations don't look that satisfying. Maybe this is because I play this game on german but really? It looks so bad. So while this game isn't bad it is only really something for point & clink fans who already played everything (Which is 90 percent of the people who would ever consider playing a point and click I know) but there are so many good games out there that are far superior, if you haven't already play deponia, or the course of monkey island or if you want something else play machinarium.

												The Inner World is a 2D point-and-click adventure game and I have to say that I expected a bit more from it. There weren't any major flaws, but most things in the game felt very average.The graphic style is probably the best thing about the game. The backgrounds are very detailed, but the same can't be said about the characters. The characters don't quite seem to fit in the world. But that's a very minor thing compared to the other issues the game has.The main character, Robert, is an apprentice to a wind monk. He is quite naïve and goofy. The other character you get to play as is Laura, who is a thief. She seemed quite grumpy and had this ""whatever"" attitude. So they're not the most likable characters.The game starts with some backstory of the world and events that lead to it's current state. After that Robert is seen polishing his master's amulet, which then gets stolen by pigeon called Peck. Peck escapes through a trash chute and Robert follows with the intention of catching Peck and getting the amulet back. The story then develops into a pretty normal point-and-click story about saving the world. After the first chapter I already knew what was going to happen in the end, because I'm pretty sure I've played game or watched a movie with a very similar plot. And it was really obvious how to story would go on after chapter 1.The store page lists screamingly funny dialogues as a feature in the game, but I didn't find the dialogue funny. It was quite boring to be honest. Could be that the funny dialogue was lost in translation, since this is a German game and I played it in English. The dialogue certainly wasn't helped by the voice acting, which ranged from bad to decent. In the end there was this ""emotional"" part in the story and the voice acting seemed like the actors were just reading their lines out loud. There was no emotion whatsoever.The puzzles in this game are also a mixed bag. Some were fairly easy to figure out while some were pretty illogical and basically required trying all possible items in order to solve them. Some items, that seemed fairly logical for solving the puzzles, didn't work and the item needed to solve the puzzle didn't always seem like they'd be a natural choice. The puzzles also required a bit of guessing. There is a hint system in the game, but it's optional and I didn't use it on my playthrough.I had a couple of weird glitches where the character would just walk to where I pointed him/her and stop and not complete the action he/she was supposed to do. After waiting for a minute or so, the character would finally do what it was supposed to do. On a second playthrough I did to get all the achievements I missed the game also crashed to desktop twice.To sum it up, The Inner World is an average point-and-click adventure with not much going for it. I beat the game in 5-6 hours, so it isn't very long. Some of the puzzles are quite frustrating and require some guesswork. The story wasn't anything special or new either to make me recommend the game. Unless you're a big fan of point-and-clicks, I don't recommend playing this one, since there are better point-and-clicks out there.			"

												Wow... I don't know what to say... I made it to chapter 2 and then had to Alt+F4 it to end this misery. I bought this game because people said it would be funny and cleverly written and just an all over nice Adventure Game. Now, after forcing myself through about 2 hours of this game, I sit here and can't believe I wasted a money on something that is rated positive. I don't even know where to start. Let's begin with the positives+ Nice graphics with a vector style look+ Good voice actors were used in the making of this thing. The game sounds quite great. That's it. I can not say anything else positive. It may find a few moments as the game continues, but I can not see myself sitting there getting more and more annoyed.Now, what are my issues with this:- First and foremost the Game is still buggy. It came out in September 2013 and it still has problems. The first time I played it, I was stuck the same moment I entered the game. So I had to uninstall and re-install the game to get it to work. Once I got to chapter two, the game was stuck in loading screen and I had to restart it again. - Funny? People keep saying the game is funny. How is this game funny? I can't decide what's worse. The flat jokes or the incredible boring dialogues as well as sexist jokes along the way which are probably funny if you are 12 years old. Pseudo-funny sidecharacters make it even more unbearable. - The dialogues are not only not funny but also unnecessarily long and unimportant as well as non informative. - The main character is so annoyingly stupid that it makes me want to beat him. - Granted I did not see many puzzles and the ones I saw were okay. I guess some of them can be quite tricky, but it's not all too bad if you are used to adventure and puzzle games. - Random non-fitting noises. I don't know how it is in the rest of the game, but in the first chapter I was already bugged out by asking myself... WHY is there a continous ""page turning"" sound in the middle of the street where nobody reads a book or does something with books and WYH is there a register checkout sound near the jail?! - The story seems to be incredible weak. It has no tension, nothing exciting and even when it is supposed to have a adventorous turn, it ends in a boring loading screen which is so annoyingly long, that I ended up watching a video while waiting. The script of this Game is just as boring as the jokes...I watched one of the most popular German Streamers play this game and even then I could not find the humor in it. Where he was laughing, I was continously facepalming myself and forwarding because even watching it was unbearable. I think if you are around an age class (real age or mental age) of 8-15 you might find this game funny.			"

												A very nice and charming point & click game. Reminds me a bit of deponia in its dark yet humorous story, interesting setting, nice music, and weird characters.Pros:- The story is pretty good (although I wouldn't rate it as great...)- The characters are alright... although somewhat idiotic and rather shallow.- I personally really liked the music, it fits the game very well in my opinion.- The game has a very unique (and really good!) hint system, which gives you a tiny piece of information every time you click (so it doesn't give you the entire answer unless you REALLY want it!)Cons:- There are a few bugs (and translation issues) in the game - some that caused me to re-load my save - but none that are game breaking, or actually more than a nuisance.- The loading times can get annoying at times (especially when you need to move between areas a lot to figure out a particular puzzle).- There are some puzzles which I wouldn't have figured out without the hint system, but not too many.Overall it's a very nice game, about 4-6 hours long, and I would recommend it to those who like a casual point & click adventure game.

												""It seems like Europe is the place to go for point-and-click games lately. From Daedalic’s awesome Deponia series, to newer entries like The Journey Down, Europe has been keeping the genre alive in both quantity and quality. Studio Fizbin looks to keep this trend going with their game, The Inner World. They’ve done their best to create a comical world with a simple-but-endearing art style. With plenty of puzzles, voice-acting, and interactions, Studio Fizbin may have a hit on their hands. The game has an innovative hint system and deals with some fairly mature themes for the genre. Do these aspects of the game lead to a winning breeze, or is it just a lot of hot air?""Full review at http://www.hbhud.com/2013/10/22/review-of-the-inner-world/ "

												Having not played this kind of game in a long time, it aggravated me how long it took to get to the next part of the story sometimes - and I swear I tried Macguyvering everything! That being said, this was an interesting game. I liked the unique art style. The voice acting was all right - Robert's was probably the best. You could tell at times that Laura's intonations weren't quite right, though, which I found odd. Also, the mixture of American and UK accents was confusing at times, but for the sake of the story I let it go. Favorite character: the garbage dealer. It's a short game, and could have used a bit of tinkering to make it into a great final vision. I recommend you get this game if it's on sale, otherwise don't pay full price.			"

I particularly liked that it is set in an interesting, original world with its own imaginative ecosystem.I did get stuck on puzzles (or knowing what to try and do) on a couple of occasions, but the built-in hint system is extensive and ranges from gentle hints to outright telling you what to do.

												[Deutsch unter]Fabulous! I had been reluctant to start this game due to the fantasy setting - silly me. It is less traditional fantasy and more like a weird and wonderful fairytale. The pacing is perfect, the puzzles make you think but never get frustrating, and the voice acting (in German, at least) is great. It has some funny exchanges, though it's not really an out-and-out comedy. Another very solid modern adventure game that all adventure fans should enjoy playing through.Fabelhaft! Ich erwartete eigentlich nicht so viel weil ich normalerweise kein Fantasy-Fan bin, aber war trotzdem toll. Die Geschichte ist mehr Märchen als Fantasy, und bleibt durch dem ganzen Spiel amüsant. Die Charaktere sind nett, das Dialog lustig und die Synchronisation top. Die Rätseln sind auch gut zu lösen, nicht zu einfach, nicht zu schwer. Einfach ein solides Abenteur. Definitiv empfehlenswert.			"

												This is a Spolier Free review.The Inner world takes place in Asposia, an inverted world of kind with the air and light being brought in by Wind Fountain and Fosfos's respectfully. In this new world we meet Robert, the adopted son of the Wind Monk to the last remaining Wind Fountain. In this world, the Basylians, wind gods, are angry with the people of Asposia and have begun to rampage and turn people into stone. Conroy, the last active wind monk, is the pope like figure in control over all of Asposia trying to save the people of this world by pleasing the Basylians to not turn the citezens into stone.  The story starts off by Robert polishing Conroy's most precious medallion, a stray pidgeon appears and Robert befriends the pidgeon but shoo's the pidgeon away as Conroy finishes his speach. Robert fearful of Conroy hands him his medallion only for the medallion to get stolen by the pidgeon. Robert wanting to please Conroy chases after the pidgeon. This is where we meet Laura, the owner of the pidgeon and wanted by the state for a multitude of crime. Laura catches Robert trying to steal the pidgeon, which belongs to her, and she grabs the pidgeon, whos name is now known as Peck, and runs off. Thus beginning the story of The Inner World.Throughout the rest of the game you will meet interesting new characters each with thier own set of witty and humorous dialoges as well as an immensive world with many secrets to behold. Robert, being sheltered all his life enters this world much like the player giving a shared viewpoint through Robert. Robert, a very shy and honest character, has a magnetic personality that I found myself easily attaching myself to. His interactions with the world around him create humor at every corner. The humor in this game goes beyond character to character interactions, the game does not take itself seriously. In a later part of the game there is a cooking book called ""Cooking for Posers by Gor Dun Ramsee"", when I found this book I nearly fell to the floor laughing due to the call back to reality the game pulled on me. The world is filled with hints and nods to pop culture and the game itself is highly meta in its own rights.While the story itself is nothing necessarily 'original' in story arc and plot points, the story is creative enough to work. The pacing of the story starts off very slow, but it gradually speeds up over time with some portions being slower than they should be. But the explosion of the storyline fits into the story arc of the game. Though the pacing fluxuated at certain points I was still enjoying the game due to the great story and the world of Asposia making me want more. The end of the story left me wanting more of this fantasy world that I fell in love with and I hope that in the future there could be a sequal or a storyline expansion to quench my thirst for more Asposia.To add onto this amazing and humorous storyline and characters, the world itself is a beauty to look at. The animations are well crafted, though I did have some issues but that was only due to hardware problems, and it ties all of the story telling elements in to create an amazing fanasty world. I highly enjoyed playing through this entire game and I would play through it again to find the parts of the side story that I missed in my first playthrough. My only complaint is the games issues with AMD GPU's but that can be fixed by installing Adobe AIR. All in all this game is a very well rounded with an incredible story with meta humor splurged throughout the extraordinary world that is Asposia.Individual RatingsStory:                                   8/10Artwork:                              10/10 Gameplay:                          10/10Mechanics:                           8/10Bang for your buck:            10/10Overall Score 92/100Game In A Sentence:Point and Click adventure with a creative and humorous story complimented by amazing artwork.

The dialogues are funny (and can be TMI at times xD ). Anyway, in case you get lost just make sure to click the ""?"" on the upper left for hints. Worth playing!			"

												Fun game that lasts about 5-6 hours for most players. Music was good, and the gameplay was as it should be for a point and click. Puzzles usually were fairly easy, to some tougher, complex puzzles. However, these puzzles were never solved with out of this world solutions, like a toothpaste and a comb made a lockpick. However, in an almost first puzzle , the game would take the idea of drowning/flushing a worm out of its hole, and decide to make you use alcohol, and as such the worm is out because it is drunk.  The story was pretty predictable from the beginning, but was funny throughout. There are some mature/suggestive themes laced in a pretty tame and overall child friendly game.I should point out two issues I had though. One was that the game about 3-4 times would get stuck while loading after a cutscene. In these cases I had to restart the game, but the pretty constant autosaving made this less of an issue. The other issue is deals with a hint system. The game supposively has one, yet I couldn't find how to use it, and as such had to at times look at a walkthrough on Youtube to solve some mildly complex puzzles. And for most people this may not be an issue, but achievement hunters may get irritated when trying to get the achievement that wants you to use the hint system.			"

												My favourite adventure game of the past few years, and I've played a lot of them.Everything is great. An interesting and easy to follow story with some very humorous parts. Graphics and music/sound are excellent. Voice acting is good to excellent, the voice of the main character is excellent and his love interest is very good. Some characters like the various guards are obviously voiced by the same person, but this makes no difference. Puzzles are almost always very good. Usually the solution to a puzzle makes sense, only in a few cases are the puzzles not completely logical and even the few slightly illogical puzzles are not to hard to guess. I didn't have to use a walkthrough at all. The game takes about 8 to 10 hours to complete.I didn't encounter any bugs in the game.I hope they do a sequel or another adventure with the same development team.			"

												The Inner World is a hand-drawn point-and-click adventure game. The voice acting is very good, and the characters are very well written. The story is whimsical and silly and dramatic, suitable for both adults and children. The art is very cartoony and creative. The game shows hot spots when you press on the space bar, so there is no pixel hunting. The puzzles vary a lot from simple to devilishly hard. There is a very nice hint system if you get stuck. It is more fun to finish the puzzles without hints. Some of the puzzles are too hard for young children, so even though the story is child-appropriate, kids younger than 12 may get frustrated. The only drawback is that there is not enough variety in the music, some songs play over and over. I can recommend this game for fans of the point-and-click adventure genre.			"

Sure, I wouldn't say it's on par with the likes of Secret of Monkey Island, but I think it is fun to play all the way through (not stretched out), great humor, fine music and graphics and the puzzles are not outright evil, and if you get stuck there's a nice incremental hint system, that can be used instead of switching back and forth between the game and a browser every once in a while for someone who plays the game more for story than figuring out every single puzzle. I am a bit tired of the ""humorous"" sexism though (humour is a typical excuse for discrimination), mainly directed at Laura, not the least when you play as her. Many of the characters she interacts with objectify her, one insisting she must be a maid and unintelligent too and another one focused only on sexual interest. Robert doesn't respect her either. At one point in the game there's also a kiss between a woman and a man that happens that's basically sexual assault, and the kisser is even confronted with it, and her rejection was basically disregarded and he even says he doesn't regret doing it. Not cool, Headup Games & Studio Fizbin!The other irritating problem I found was that the game crashed or got stuck on me every once in a while (maybe 7 times when I played through the entire game including all possible dialogue), but nothing that ruined the save, so it's not terrible. What does make this issue somewhat scary is that the game only creates a single save, so if it was hypothetically corrupted, there'd be no option but to start all over. I think a good solution for this problem - other than fixing the bugs - would be to create a save at the start of each chapter besides the current save which saves during a chapter too. This way one wouldn't have to start all over, and furthermore these saves will make getting all the achievements less of a pain.Finally there's generally always two actions you can perform in the game, which for some reason are both mapped to a submenu when left-clicking, instead of mapping one to the left and right mouse button, which is a simple change that would definitely improve the UX in my opinion.To sum up I definitely recommend this (mostly) very charming game!

												The Inner World is my first point and click game i've ever played, The story and setting are both very interesting and fun! The puzzles are sometimes hard but I never felt frustrated because of the great hint system. It tells you the solution to puzzles in parts so if you just need a little help understanding something it is there for you! For this reason I say this is a must have for newcomers to this great genre!!! On top of all that the art and sound are also great!So great art, characters, and fun puzzle with a great hint system, what is there not to like about this game? For point and click newcomers like myself or veterans I can say that the Inner World is a game you will not want to miss out on!! I will definitely be coming back to this game in the future for another playthrough!			"

												Fantastic adventure game. With loveable characters, cheesy yet charming voice acting, an awesome 2D art style, and a fantastic world design, this is one adventure you don't want to miss out on. Reminds me quite a bit of Pajama Sam. The only real criticism I have about it is that the game is a little bit too short, but still a fantastic and rewarding experience nonetheless. Buy it today.

												The Inner World is a light-hearted and fun point and click adventure game! The story was warm and adventurous and the setting was very enjoyable; from the slums, to the bar, to the jungles and ruins of Asposia. Although a short game, i clocked in nine hours, the experience was very enjoyable. Great voice acting, the graphics are fun and easy on the eyes, the game mechanics are very easy to learn, and the music is great! If you're into point n click adventure games, this is one worth experiencing!			"

												The Inner World is a hand-drawn point-and-click adventure game. The voice acting is very good, and the characters are very well written. The story is whimsical and silly and dramatic, suitable for both adults and children. The art is very cartoony and creative. The game shows hot spots when you press on the space bar, so there is no pixel hunting. The puzzles vary a lot from simple to devilishly hard. There is a very nice hint system if you get stuck. It is more fun to finish the puzzles without hints. Some of the puzzles are too hard for young children, so even though the story is child-appropriate, kids younger than 12 may get frustrated. The only drawback is that there is not enough variety in the music, some songs play over and over. I can recommend this game for fans of the point-and-click adventure genre.			"

												Very highly recconmend this game. I expected it to be cute and simple due to my impression of the art style but don't let the look fool you. This game isn't afriad of tossing a few lowgrade curse words here and some innuendo there and a dash of some Monty Python or Beatles references. Definetly a wonderful game and I most certainly got stuck on a few of the puzzles for quite some time. Log around 10 hours and every second was enjoyable.			"

But if you are a fan of their work, this game is another solid entry from what is becoming one of my favorite developers.			"

At the end of it, its like you have just finished watching an animated movie which is quite satisfying. Some of the puzzle are quite hard but the clue system is there to help you through. You can just be lazy and open it all up or just open enough up to give you a hint.Great game all in all. Need more Point n Click like this, short and fun, not like most Point and Click which is bloody long and dreadful to play. Great music also. +110 cats out of 10.			"

												Even tho I play most types of games, point&clicks arent really my top priorities... *but* ... I can, without a shred of doubt, say that this was truly a pleasant experience, you grow fond of and connect with the characters ingame, even with the NPCs for whom you do tasks to progress, well at least I grew fond of them ^^. I have listened to each and every line of dialogue in the game and didnt once feel bored.Art style and humor are subjective, but if you want my opinion on them, and considering you're reading this, you probably do, I found the art style charming and caught myself grinning/giggling (and even a couple of genuine laughs a couple of times) quite often.Gameplay is... point&click-y, but what do you expect ? It's a point&click game, so are the puzzles, cuz they are puzzles imo, any good ? It'd say they fit nicely into the whole world that the game creates and are no push-over so they will pose a fair challenge. (not all of them, of course, but you get my ""drift"")All in all it's a very pleasant game to sink a couple of hours into with likable/interesting characters, interesting world, fun dialogue, enjoyable puzzles (yes, enjoyable!). What more can I say ? If the price tag is too much for you wait for a sale, but if you're into point&clicks games you, dear reader, should definitely check this one out.			"

												A very fun point-n-click adventure! Great voice acting, engaging story, and clever puzzles. Probably the coolest thing is the in-game hint system, which gives incremental hints that can be used to point you in the right direction if you're stuck, but don't give everything away (unless you want them to)! The only ""downside"" are some of the puzzles rely on familiarity of how wind instruments work. They were cool and interesting, but I felt like a total idiot when playing through them and had quite a bit of trouble with them. I still sincerely recommend this game, though!			"

												This game is totally great. If you've enjoyed Machinarium and The Dream Machine, you will definetely like this one! While it's slightly easier than both of them, I've still found myself stuck couple of times and going to their help system, which is great at giving hints without uncovering everything at once. The art is great, the sound is great and probably it's the most relaxing point and click I've ever played. Even comparing to Botanicula.What could be possibly improved: 1) Although I think that highlighting interactive spots makes game much less challenging and should be presented as an option of ""easy"" mode. Same goes for detailed hints, which are absolutely great, but knowing you have them makes you use them :)2) Animations of combining things are almost useless, and probably should be presented as an option in settings.3) What upset me the most after I completed the game - there's absolutely no way to start a separate chapter, so if you want to get all of the achievements you'll need to do it in the first run or play it again from the beginning just making to the points where you know you'll get achievements (they are rather obvious when you complete the game).And while I liked this game a lot, I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price, though I can understand how much effort had been put in making it. If you absolutely want point-n-click for 10 bucks, I would recommend ""The Dream Machine"" instead. And still ""Yes, I totally recommend this game"". "

												A very nice and charming point & click game. Reminds me a bit of deponia in its dark yet humorous story, interesting setting, nice music, and weird characters.Pros:- The story is pretty good (although I wouldn't rate it as great...)- The characters are alright... although somewhat idiotic and rather shallow.- I personally really liked the music, it fits the game very well in my opinion.- The game has a very unique (and really good!) hint system, which gives you a tiny piece of information every time you click (so it doesn't give you the entire answer unless you REALLY want it!)Cons:- There are a few bugs (and translation issues) in the game - some that caused me to re-load my save - but none that are game breaking, or actually more than a nuisance.- The loading times can get annoying at times (especially when you need to move between areas a lot to figure out a particular puzzle).- There are some puzzles which I wouldn't have figured out without the hint system, but not too many.Overall it's a very nice game, about 4-6 hours long, and I would recommend it to those who like a casual point & click adventure game.

The bug is not too much as it would only occur if one is impatient like I am. So I would suggest to not RAPIDLY click through dialogue, combine items or use items on objects in an impatient manner. I would recommend this game to those who enjoy humorous dialogues or unique plot.			"

												A short adventure game with some charm and enough of a hook to keep you interested for a playthrough.  While it is polished enough to be worth your time, it hasn't enough charm or substance in the storytelling to keep you engrossed.A first stab at the adventure genre by the developers, they've told a story of a little boy who is a member of an underground civilization plagued by a number of problems, first are all these wind gods turning people into stone and the second being the absence of wind.  The world is foreign and interesting enough with its own history, culture, and physics that keep you guessing and interested in what is happening and what led up to the present sequence of events.  The story is, boy gets caught up in problem, meets anarchist girl, ends up in revolution, discovers past, bad stuff happens, uses past to save the world, live happily ever after.  The story is adventure game fodder and is not done exceptional enough to make it seem new or like something I haven't played already.The dialogue was translated from German and it was done well enough save for some patchy words which made it into the localization, misnamed objects, odd sentences and the like.  As far as that goes, there is a LOT of dialogue.  Your mileage may vary if you consider this a good or bad thing.  It provides a lot of exposition, character development, and world building.  It also starts falling into the land of monotonous walls of text.  If you are having any issues with a dialogue puzzle, you can expect to see the same lines repeated several times.The art is done to give the game its own style.  It's cartoony, imaginative, and contributes to the development of the story and world.  The only issue I had with it was it had so much drab and brown, but that's for my own tastes.The puzzles, dialogue and inventory, are done well and help the pacing, which is all I can ask of puzzles in an adventure game.  They are well-made and don't require the use of LOL logic to figure out.  Their difficulty improves gradually over the game and helps immersion and pacing.  If you have problems, the game has an interactive hint book which can help push you in the right direction.  There's nothing really bad I can say about them other than the repetition you may face if you have issues with a dialogue puzzle.In all, the game is ok and I had no real problems with it.  The only problem is, it exists in a genre swamped with better games and other games no better than this one.  If you are an adventure game fan, you can play this for something new.  Otherwise, look for something else.			"

												In this point-and-click adventure game, you play as Robert, an adorably naive boy in the land of Asposia, an entire society built on the inside of the world rather than on its surface (hence the name of the game). Asposia runs on wind, but only wind fountain out of the original three in Asposia is still functioning, so the lights are going out and the residents will soon suffocate. Also, there are attacks from the wind gods, who petrify anyone deemed ""immoral."" Robert gets unwillingly pulled along for the ride. It's a great story with some interesting puzzles.Pros:+ Great story and worldbuilding. Very unique.+ Good humor. Robert is adorable and sheltered, leading to some hilarious situations like him not understanding sexual innuendo or is naive enough to believe a holy man when he claims that he's ""meditating"" while at a slot machine. There are lots of other fun characters, like helpless researchers and blockheaded guards.+ Decent music. Not super memorable, but good at setting a mood and not intrusive or annoying.Neutral:~ Generally fun puzzles, but there were a few that were annoying because they involve combining a bunch of non-related items to solve a puzzle, and it's not obvious what you're making until it's finished. Having the ""A-ha!"" moment AFTER you've built a thing is definitely the wrong order.Con:- Game is a bit buggy. I had a game-breaking bug in the last chapter, but fortunately, there are save game files available in the Steam community for all the chapters. Also, you have to have Adobe Air up to date or the game will freeze after every cut scene.Overall: 8/10. It's a fun game, and definitely worth a play if you like adventure games.			"

												What a delightful game! It's quirky and full of fun characters and moments, and though I was left stumped a few times, when I ran out of ideas (or patience) the game itself provided a hint system that did its best not to give you the answer straight out, but to gently coax you in the thought pattern they intended. It was also a nostalgic trip for me, since I've grown up on point-and-click adventure games, like the fabled Quest for Glory series and the King's Quest series, but crafted in such a way that made it delightfully modern and fresh. Also, what fantastic voice acting! Robert's voice is incredibly easy on the ears, and I loved all of the commentary from both him and Laura. One of the other things that I truly loved was to see Robert's own journey - having the courage to escape from the only home he'd ever known, and then to face the truth of his surrogate father being a terrible monster (not really a spoiler, since you can tell right away that he's not a good person at all), all the while never losing his gentle spirit. In fact, his kindness, polite demeanor, steadfastness in the face of adversity, and humility were the things I most loved about him.I do hope there will be a sequel - I'd love to spend more time in Asposia and get to explore the world more!

												Very cute point-and-click game. Not to hard, not to easy with a bunch of superb puzzles and rather unique feel to it, Hand-drawn visuals are a strong point of the game. The overall story feels light and interesting with heartfelt characters.			"

												This is fairly traditional point and click game, i.e. you have to collect everything not nailed down and rub it against everything else till the story progresses. This kind of gameplay can get frustrating when you cannot work out the insane combinations of items required to solve the puzzle but this game gets round this by a very nice hints system. Unlike the hints systems in some of the Telltale games which gives you hints that only make sense if you know the solution, this hint system gives you loads of little hints and if you keep clicking it eventually just tells you what to do. This is a really nice system as you just use it till you get the bit of information you need to make all the clues click together into place without having to go away and look up a full walkthrough. Aside from that is has a cool world with likeable characters and a good story which is really what you are looking for in a point and click game.			"

												This is a point and click adventure filled with cutscenes and fantastic voice acting. The story and the puzzles were fun. There were some really big performance issues with this game however. 1. The loading times between each area was longer than one would expect (10+ seconds maybe)? 2. Some delay between clicking and the text popping up / sound playing (probably a loading issue)3. Black screens... this happened to me at least 3 times. Going from one 'area' to another caused a complete blackout - only a restart bypassed it. This may have had to do with cutscenes not playing properly. I'm not sure why.In terms of size, this game felt really small... as each act only had about 3-4 areas were you could explore. Additionally, the number of characters you could interact with were a small handful as well. This meant that most of the dialog in each act were from only one or two characters. I felt having so few characters was a terrible decision as it meant characters would literally drone on and on monotonously. Unfortunately for all of this. This is only a 6.5/10 for me. The story was fun, puzzles were fun, but the performance issues  and the design choice of having few areas + few characters really made the game slow.			"

												The pace is rather slow, but very relaxing. The main theme is such a pleasant song as well. Story was rather interesting, and Robert had such a cute personality! THE WOOL MOUSE AND FOSFOSES ARE JUST THE CUTEST THINGS EVER. <3The Inner World is now not only my favorite Point 'n' Click game, it is definitely one of my top 5 games as well. The music is so pleasant and the game itself is less repetitive, more calm, and all dialogues are way more interesting than any other games I've seen.  I've never used any hints (*cough* #AchievementGet) and I've talked to every single person in the game (*cough* #AchievementGet), and the dialogues are in no way boring. There are quite a lot of little background contexts as well, if you love little background lores and stuff.			"

												A very enjoyable experience. Sometime the solutions are a bit random, so you just ahve to play around. But the help system is great, no wikis needed.The characters are lovable, the soundtrack is very fitting (reminds me a lot of A Series of Unfortunate Events) and the artstyle is unique. The world this adventure creates is so weird but charming.			"

												A short adventure game with some charm and enough of a hook to keep you interested for a playthrough.  While it is polished enough to be worth your time, it hasn't enough charm or substance in the storytelling to keep you engrossed.A first stab at the adventure genre by the developers, they've told a story of a little boy who is a member of an underground civilization plagued by a number of problems, first are all these wind gods turning people into stone and the second being the absence of wind.  The world is foreign and interesting enough with its own history, culture, and physics that keep you guessing and interested in what is happening and what led up to the present sequence of events.  The story is, boy gets caught up in problem, meets anarchist girl, ends up in revolution, discovers past, bad stuff happens, uses past to save the world, live happily ever after.  The story is adventure game fodder and is not done exceptional enough to make it seem new or like something I haven't played already.The dialogue was translated from German and it was done well enough save for some patchy words which made it into the localization, misnamed objects, odd sentences and the like.  As far as that goes, there is a LOT of dialogue.  Your mileage may vary if you consider this a good or bad thing.  It provides a lot of exposition, character development, and world building.  It also starts falling into the land of monotonous walls of text.  If you are having any issues with a dialogue puzzle, you can expect to see the same lines repeated several times.The art is done to give the game its own style.  It's cartoony, imaginative, and contributes to the development of the story and world.  The only issue I had with it was it had so much drab and brown, but that's for my own tastes.The puzzles, dialogue and inventory, are done well and help the pacing, which is all I can ask of puzzles in an adventure game.  They are well-made and don't require the use of LOL logic to figure out.  Their difficulty improves gradually over the game and helps immersion and pacing.  If you have problems, the game has an interactive hint book which can help push you in the right direction.  There's nothing really bad I can say about them other than the repetition you may face if you have issues with a dialogue puzzle.In all, the game is ok and I had no real problems with it.  The only problem is, it exists in a genre swamped with better games and other games no better than this one.  If you are an adventure game fan, you can play this for something new.  Otherwise, look for something else.			"

												So I got this game as part of a Humble Bundle not expecting much and really jut wanted it for trading cards and now I cant stop recommending this to any person who is a fan of point and click adventure games. What started as a load the game in the background to run for cards turned into a marathon journey to finish an amazing game.The art style is adorable and unique, reminding me of an almost Dr.Seuss like world full of vibrant characters and colorful set peices. What hoked me though was the characters AND the story. I genuily cared about Robert and the Asposians, I wanted to find out more about the mysterious Laura and her plight. Point and clicks generally live or die by their story and this one doesnt dissapoint.There is also a suprising amount of subtle adult humor in the game through dialogue. I'm looking at you Barmaid! Your sins still make me blush! It made me laugh several times and helped me get invested in the game.So do I recomend this game? Hell yes. It is a wonderful adventure and if your a fan of adventure games pick this up :)hope this helped!			"

												This is a lovely little point and clicker, with a unique universe and interesting characters. The voices are great and the story is told lovingly. The hand-drawn animation does the job and the lovely backdrops really carry the atmosphere alongside the beautiful soundtrack. Makes me nostalgic for the old point and click games I grew up with. Like some of these, the puzzles can be a little obscure sometimes but nothing a bit of experimentation won't solve. A great little game, pick it up!			"

												A very interesting puzzle game about a little guys 1st day in the real world. I love how innocent this character is and how he handles certain situations. It will get progressively harder and stranger as you get further into the story. Personally I say give this one a try. Can't garment everyone will like it but you at least have to try it out. Game style reminds me of the old leisure suit Larry games from th mid to late 90's.			"

												In this point-and-click adventure game, you play as Robert, an adorably naive boy in the land of Asposia, an entire society built on the inside of the world rather than on its surface (hence the name of the game). Asposia runs on wind, but only wind fountain out of the original three in Asposia is still functioning, so the lights are going out and the residents will soon suffocate. Also, there are attacks from the wind gods, who petrify anyone deemed ""immoral."" Robert gets unwillingly pulled along for the ride. It's a great story with some interesting puzzles.Pros:+ Great story and worldbuilding. Very unique.+ Good humor. Robert is adorable and sheltered, leading to some hilarious situations like him not understanding sexual innuendo or is naive enough to believe a holy man when he claims that he's ""meditating"" while at a slot machine. There are lots of other fun characters, like helpless researchers and blockheaded guards.+ Decent music. Not super memorable, but good at setting a mood and not intrusive or annoying.Neutral:~ Generally fun puzzles, but there were a few that were annoying because they involve combining a bunch of non-related items to solve a puzzle, and it's not obvious what you're making until it's finished. Having the ""A-ha!"" moment AFTER you've built a thing is definitely the wrong order.Con:- Game is a bit buggy. I had a game-breaking bug in the last chapter, but fortunately, there are save game files available in the Steam community for all the chapters. Also, you have to have Adobe Air up to date or the game will freeze after every cut scene.Overall: 8/10. It's a fun game, and definitely worth a play if you like adventure games.			"

												I do enjoy the game; I would recommend it to my friends. The soundtrack the game comes with needs to be compressed so when I open it on Steam to look for it...there are not a 100 individual tracks waiting for me. Admittidly, I have seen much worse. Also, on my PC the lipsync and the sfx are a bit off during cutscenes but not during gameplay.			"

												The Inner World is a fantastic game. The production quailty is very high, and  the art direction in particular is superb. The dialogue is witty - often dry and droll or amusingly absurd. The music and sound effects are just perfect, and the characters are relatable, evocative, funny and even adorable. At times the puzzles are a little obscure, but for the most part their solutions are more easily deduced than many games of this type because practical creative problem solving - given the clues and tools at hand - does the trick. If you enjoy humorous, imaginative,  story-driven, and beautifully illustrated point and click adventure games, you'll definitely want to add The Inner World to your collection!			"

												I went into this game hopeful, but also with lower expecations (if that makes any sense at all). I'd read a lot of the reviews, and while most of them were positive, I did see a few negative reviews that had me a bit worried. But I have to admit- I was pleasantly surprised by the game as a whole. Things do start off a bit slowly (in my opinion, at least), but they quickly get interesting. If you're someone who enjoys puzzles and a pretty good story, then I'd definitely recommend this one!			"

												Great traditional point & click adventure game. The story, while not overly deep, is interesting and certainly charming with a bit of dark humor thrown in.The puzzles were often challenging, using that special brand of logic reserved for point & click adventure games. Luckily, there's a fantastic hint system that can very subtly nudge you in the right direction.The voice acting, graphics, and characters were all wonderful in every possible way. It's obvious a lot of care went into this game. Would definitely recommend.			"
