												It suffers from the same issues as the first Syberia (the puzzles aren't great, lots of running back and forth across empty screens) but the story goes to some interesting places and the environments are quite beautiful. I went through it with a walkthrough and enjoyed it.			"

												This game is a lovely little adventure.  Travel around the world searching for clues to unravel a mystery.  It's a puzzle-style game, where you ""point and click"" to interact with your environment and items in your backpack.  Beautifully written and engaging story, with stylized backdrops for you to explore just long enough to enjoy them without ever getting bored.  This game picks up just a little while after the first Syberia ends.  So probably play that one first, then start this one.			"

Short version: 88%Like the first game, Syberia II uses its slow pace and dreamlike atmosphere to immerse the player in its wonderful world of clockwork machinery and snowy landscapes. As an adventure game, it also turned up the puzzle difficulty, sometimes significantly.Long version:Syberia II is, from beginning to end, one large journey, continuing straight from the ending scene of the previous game. Once again, we participate in a long trip of the returning protagonist, Kate Walker and the mysterious heir she chased all the way through the first game, Hans Voralberg.Syberia II is a sentimental tale, where the theme of the first game has matured into such questions as how long would someone go to fulfil their old dreams before their days run out, and how one can re-evaluate their purpose in life when they find a cause worthy enough to leave everything behind.As with most stories full of allegories, it is very slow and very dreamlike. The scenery reflects how our protagonists gradually leave the edge of civilisation as the last post of humanity, a small post-Soviet barter town fades into the distance of the vast Russian tundra, where the end of the tracks may hold the answer in their search of the last resting place of the remaining mammoths, the mythical island called Syberia.The game uses another tool to let the players immerse themselves in its world and atmosphere besides the slow pacing: the puzzles. They don’t use the warped point ‘n’ click logic that ruined many great games, but many of them rely on trial and error or constantly travelling from one end of a large gameplay area to another. The last third of the plot is especially notorious, where the difficulty quickly rises to almost legendary levels.But all that hardship will be worth it. Worth it for one of the most bittersweet, wonderful endings we can witness in an adventure game.			"

												I beat Syberia a year or two ago and while I really enjoyed it and knew that the journey continued in Syberia II, other games and life called me away. When I learned that Syberia 3 was in the works, a fire got lit underneath me and I finally played and finished Syberia 2 in preparation. I am so glad that I didn't play Syberia 2 until 3 was announced because I think I would have some seriously unanswered questions, but lets start from the beginning.Syberia II starts immediately after Syberia ends, so it is not so much a sequel as it is a continuation of the story. Now if you think that a game that has the story of a New York lawyer named Kate Walker going to Eastern Europe to wrap up a business deal and ends up instead helping an old man who is a genius with building automatons (NOT robots) go to the supposedly fictional island of Syberia where mammoths still live is boring, then move along. If however you think that that plot has possiblities you have to play it. I dare say it will be unlike any game you play. I know it stands out for me. Where to even begin? I love the world that Benoit Sokal has created. Even though it is mostly snow, and blizzards and vey remote locations on the fringe of civilization, it is gorgeous. The cut scenes are exciting, beautiful, and add to the overall mystic feel of the game. The soundtrack is a wonderful blend of regular orchestral music or a tribal feel, depending on where you are in the game. I love the characters. Seriously, if I were to pick a favorite heroine, it would be a tie between Commander Shephard and Kate Walker. I think Kate is that amazing. She doesn't save the world, but she questions the importance of having the ideal job in an ideal place. In her case it's a promising career in New York City. She learns how important it is to follow your dreams, and help others realize theirs, despite how crazy or off the beaten path they are. It's a real life lesson, and I think that is what makes her so special. The cast of characters that surround her are also memorable. I love Oscar. He may come off as annoying to some but personally I would love to go on a train adventure with him. The story really focuses on Hans, whom Kate is helping reach Syberia. It is his dream that is the focus and what drives Kate. The dynamic between these three makes this game special, and at times heartbreaking.Of course, you can't have an adventure game without the puzzles. The key is to talk to everyone about everything you can. This will give you clues about where to go. Each area feels like a kind of level, so there are only so much backtracking. The puzzles are everywhere from pretty easy, to definitely having to think. It will just depend of your experience with adventure games. Now I must address one thing - the ending. They got it right, mostly. Once the journey is over, there is definitely a loose string - Well, what now Kate Walker? Luckily, we will be getting the answer in Syberia 3, and I can't wait to see what new adventure she finds herself in.			"

												Excellent storyline defines this game's playability. Although the theme of the story doesn't seem special at all, the developer must be complimented for building a haunting gameplay upon it. Elements of longing, mysticism, fantasy, and mystery are well-blended, and will make you want to play further and further. Dialogues are well-written and entertaining. Visuals are dated and nothing special. While playing it on a 24"" 1080p monitor wasn't a great experience – the blurry edges around all objects were quite visible – my enjoyment of the game wasn't impeded in any sense. Puzzles are quite straight-forward, and don't require any critical thinking skills; just be alert to your surroundings at all times, and pay special attention to all objects that your character can interact with, for be assured, such objects will have some use in the game.The only irritant – a big one – in the game is its tedious gameplay. Your character will need to walk around a lot in order to solve puzzles and find things and NPCs. All that could've easily been bypassed by making the character appear at the location of interest with a single click. But no! The sadistic game designers make you watch as the character meanders her way to the desired location, which will make you terribly impatient and peeved, and you might even turn-off the game in anger...only to return a few hours later :).SCORE: 7/10 (3 points deducted for tedious gameplay, average visuals, and unintelligent game design)PS: To play the complete story, you will need to play this game after Syberia, the first episode that sells as a separate game. However,  if, for some reason, you decide to play this game only, you will be briefed about what happened in the first episode via an option in the main menu. My recommendation is that you play both parts in order. This is a really good, no non-sense game, and its story will stay with you forever.			"

My Personal Score: 1.5/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: barebones graphics options and lacking PC-exclusive features. Uses pre-rendered backgrounds at 800x600 resolution. Susceptible to graphics bugs and crashes, especially when alt+tabbing out of the game, then back again.DLC: None.Microtransactions: None.Syberia II is a disappointing sequel to me, since the first one started strong and introduced an amazing cast, as well as some of the best character development in a video game. This sequel undermines everything that made Syberia great, and to top it all off, the whole plot is boring and you can see everything happening a mile away. The content is comparable to modern story DLCs where the final chapter of a game is seperated from the main storyline and is sold seperately. Syberia II doesn't work well as a standalone, and it isn't accomodating to new players who didn't play the first game; the story is a hodgepodge without proper context from Syberia. There's no character development and not much has been changed on the gameplay side of things - it's like the studio were assuming that only players of the first title would be interested this sequel. Overall, it's not a bad game, but don't get your expectations too high or you'll just be disappointed at the end.What I Liked And Didn't Like:*For fans of Syberia, the game ends in a very satisfying manner and Kate's wanderlust has proven to be worth it but the journey towards their goal is so drab and boring. Side characters have no lasting impact on both Kate and Hans, the antagonists are comical, and key plot points reveal in an unsatisfying manner. Syberia II just didn't work for me since this game is all about fulfilling an agenda, rather than satiating Kate's desires of discovering herself, and expanding the mythos surrounding Hans Voralberg.*The backtracking had been minimized considerably but some puzzles are so obscure and complex, you have to scour every inch of the levels and read every note to find the solution, making the player backtrack a lot, regardless of the improvements made to counter that. True story: I never consulted guides during my playthrough of Syberia, but Syberia II prompted me to do otherwise.And there you have it.			"

												The ending is as fulfilling as I wished it to be. Syberia made me love and discover more point and clicks. Such a good voice acting. Everything about the series is precious to me. The music that starts playing whenever you're on the right track. I became attached to the characters as a kid. For instance, whenever Kate's mother would call (or her friend\husbando\boss), I was like ""heck, who wants to go back home when such adventure awaits?""Much freedom, such adventure, wowza.

												The sequel to the wonderful first game Syberia continues the journey of Kate Walker and Hans Voralberg to the land of mammoths. The gameplay is identical in nature to the first one and it's still stuck in the land of 800x600 resolution. I didn't find the story of Syberia 2 to be anywhere near the level of interest and engagement as the first. It mostly revolves around keeping Hans healthy enough to complete the trip. But reaching the final scene brought a sense of closure to everything the game has offered--a worthy adventure.			"

												Syberia 2 is a casual exploration game with a lovely story and marvelous visuals. It's hard to find directions at times and there are no clues for some puzzles (it's just a matter of trial and error to solve them). But, since you shouldn't play this game for intellectual challenge anyway, but rather the story, I suggest to use this walktrough guide: http://www.gameboomers.com/wtcheats/pcSs/syberia2.htm. Also, there are some geographical and historical inaccuracies in the story, but don't be too fault-finding. View Syberia 2 as a modern fairy-tale.Although, this game is better than it's predecessor in every aspect, somehow I didn't enjoy it that much. It's still worth buying for a calm and relaxing experience. My overall rating: 7.5/10.			"

Syberia 2 reviewThe Good: The visuals and music are absolutely wonderful; there is a better variety in puzzles which makes the game more challenging.The Bad: There is slightly less character development than before; many of the cutscenes have very hammy dialogue ala the preview for the game.The original Syberia was an excellent game that came at a time when great adventures were scarce at best. It told a rich and enthralling story that left fans wanting more. In the two years since the original’s release, the adventure community has been through many disappointments, leaving Kate Walker again the task of breathing a little life back into the genre. There are a few slip-ups on the way, but thankfully Syberia II withstands those enough to succeed at its task.When we last saw our intrepid heroine, Kate Walker, she was jumping onto a train, essentially leaving her former life as a corporate yuppie lawyer behind to accompany the eccentric dreamer Hans Voralberg on his quest to find the land of Syberia. Syberia II picks up exactly where the first game left off, and in reality, this game should be looked at as more of a direct continuation of the first game, rather than a sequel that stands on its own. While there is a video recap of Syberia to assist new players, I don’t think that people who haven’t played the first game will care very much about the objective at hand. Therefore, I strongly recommend that if you have not played through the original Syberia yet, you should do so before taking on the sequel.As the game begins, your train makes a stop in Romansburg -- the last bastion of civilization before the endless tundra. After the opening cutscene, you gain control of Kate, and you will quickly realize that the interface is exactly as before: very simple and streamlined. Everything is completely point & click, with hotspots indicating when an item can be picked up or manipulated. By right-clicking you can access the inventory screen to either use or view items. It is so simple that anyone could start this game and ease right into the gameplay without having to consult a manual. There really are no interface differences between this and the first game to speak of, which I see as a good thing; the original interface worked just fine and by keeping it the same it makes the two halves feel like a single larger whole.The main complaint with Syberia was the short playing time and lack of challenging puzzles. It is obvious that the game developers took this criticism to heart, because the largest area of improvement in the game over its predecessor is indeed the puzzle design. The most impressive aspect of the game, to me, was the real effort to put a variety of puzzles into the game -- not just inventory-based puzzles as was the case before, but puzzles that run the gamut from the relatively simple inventory-based puzzles to more difficult logic-based ones -- you may even want to anticipate getting stuck for a while!(Something I never would have dreamed to happen in Syberia.) The addition of more varied puzzles that range in difficulty has helped lengthen the playing time to almost double that of the original game, giving the player much more bang for their buck.What the game gains in puzzle design though, it loses somewhat in character development. Kate’s motivations are very murky. In the first game, much of her personality and character arc is explained through her interactions with other in-game characters and her conversations on her cell phone. But as Kate wanders further and further away from civilization, meaningful character interactions become less and less common. In response to general criticism, the use of the cell phone has been marginalized in the sequel; although I am in the minority, I never minded the use of the cell phone as a storytelling device in Syberia. In a journey where your character is by herself most of the time, the presence of the cell phone is often the only thing to give the player insight into Kate’s emotions and thought processes. By all but removing that device, the game suffers from lack of character exposition. The player is left to extrapolate possible motivations for Kate based on assumptions, not by material that is present in the game.Also less prevalent in this game are the symbolisms that in part, made the first installment so interesting. The themes of life and death, spirituality vs. machinery, abandonment, loss, and faith are all still present, but they aren’t as tantalizingly de-constructible as before. What are very tantalizing, however, are the graphics. Once again, the Microids art department has outdone themselves. Everything is even more gorgeous this time around than the original, if that's possible. All of the cutscenes, the backgrounds, and the characters look beautiful and are all improved on in some way over the first game. The characters have better expressions, the backgrounds are more detailed, and the cutscenes are even more cinematic. You can tell that they put painstaking detail into everything seen on screen. There are also nice little realistic touches to each frame: birds can be seen flying, wind rustling in the trees, rushing water, animals scurrying across the snow and other things that may be unnecessary to the actual gameplay, but add indubitably to the atmosphere.Equally as wonderful is the sound. Each locale of the game features a musical theme that is well-suited to the mood of that place. The score is very well done and my only complaint would be that I want to hear more of it; it really is beautiful. The voice acting is also much more solid all around than it was in the first game, and the dialogue remains strong throughout, with one small exception: it tends to get a bit heavy-handed and cheesy during the cutscenes -– very reminiscent of the dialogue in the trailer that was released for the game.For many people, enjoying this game to the fullest will hinge on how much of a tradeoff they are willing to make between the story and the puzzles. Many of the original’s most vocal supporters loved it because of the storyline while many of its detractors criticized it for the lack of challenge. The developers took note of this and made a concerted effort to put in a greater variety of puzzles, but in doing so, the story -- in some respects -- falls by the wayside just a bit. However, the quality of the game as a whole is so outstanding that you will be willing to accept what is now a great story with improved puzzles, instead of what was a superb story with lackluster puzzles. Everyone should be able to find something -- most likely many things -- to admire about this game and I recommend it highly to everyone. "

PROS:+ amazing story telling+ atmosphere of an adventure+ fun puzzles+ very good voice acting+ smoother gameplay than previous game+ likable protagonist+ epic conclusion to the Syberia seriesCONS:- some puzzles are ridiculously difficult- occasional graphic glitch- maybe still a bit of empty running aroundComment:Like I stated in my Syberia review it has been about 10 years since I played Syberia 2, which I never finished. Then I saw Syberia bundle on sale so I bought it. Just recently I finished Syberia which was good but lacked a level of polish. Syberia 2 picks up after the first game and you are plunged into the adventure. The voice acting remains really good. The story of the sequel is written very well and it is the high-point of the game. While having a cliche villain it still remains magical and fun. Gameplay is much better and even visually everything is much smoother. Puzzles are fairly challenging and fun .... well, most of them. And here is where I remembered why I had not finished the game back then. Very hard & difficult puzzles! Not many but just the few will make you frustrated with the game. In all honesty, while I get that devs wanted to add a flavour of challenge, the game would have done MUCH better without these. My pro-tip is to look through all the inventories for clues and items, EVERY TIME. And if all else fails look up a guide, there is no shame in that, the story is so good it deserves to be finished. So do I recommend? I indeed do, the game is great! But get the whole Syberia bundle!			"

												I would not recommend Syberia 2. I enjoyed the first one, and got quite invested in the story, but I feel as if Syberia 2 falls quite far from being as good as the first.The first problem I have with it is the walking. There's a lot of it. Now, in the frist game, this wasn't so bad, as there were lots of interesting environments and characters, but this sequel just feels empty. I understand that, beyond the first village, you're in the middle of nowhere, so it's unlikely to be very populated, but it still just feels too empty, which makes walking around to solve puzzles a very slow and tedious affair.The story itself is good, it follows on well. The puzzles themselves aren't too bad, aside from the odd one that requires a leap of understanding to get the answer.As far as the art goes, it continues to be low resolution, but still fairly high quality. There is an annoying glitch with the character's mouths moving way too fast and not syncing up with the sound though.Tl;dr not as good as the original. Not terribly bad, but not great. Play it if you're very interested in the story.			"

												One of my all-time favorite adventure games. It improves on the first game with improved graphics and better game mechanics, especially dialogue. The graphics are no longer cutting edge as of 2012, but they are very nice to look at and complement the story well. Like the first game, this is more of an interactive story than a puzzle game. The puzzles are fun, but they are not the focus of the game. Most of the puzzles are solvable without too much difficulty. I used the hints a few times when I got stuck. An adventure game vet will not need hints too often. I can recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games.			"

												I played this game a long time ago and decided that I wanted to play again since I used to love this game. The graphics are nice, considering the age of the game. It has breathtaking backgrounds, definitely enough to look at. The music and voice acting is very good as well. The gameplay is your standard point-and-click adventuring. There are some disadvantantages, it takes a while to go from a screen to the next which can become frustrating. Often you need to go between screens to try and complete some sequence of actions or find some item you missed, this takes forever! Fortunately the story is very good and really worth the hassle with the pixel hunting. It is also an option to play with the help of a walkthrough just to enjoy the story, it is worth it! When you are a adventure game fan, play this game! If you are not, the gameplay might get extremely frustrating but I would still say play it for the amazing story!			"

												Following its namesake, Syberia II features the American lawyer Kate Walker on her voyage alongside Hans Voralberg, an stunded genius and Oscar, their automaton train operator. Like its predecessor, the game is set in a post-Soviet backdrop of unspecified geography and features various locations ranging from a Russian mining town, a Monastery, and Subarctic forests, to Youkol settlements and even a dream-trance state of Valadilène (the town from the first game) through all of  which the player guides Walker throguh many difficulties of their journey. The plot, straightforward as it appears, features many details regarding Hans' obsessions, as well as Kate's former life, flesh out the storyline. There is an underlining theme of the Hans' quest comes across as one of almost prophetic proportions, which lends the game an odd mixture of magical realism tinged by the Art Nouveau-themes steampunk of many locations. The user interface is slightly cluncky and direction arrows may get slightly confusing at times. The same applies for the interface on puzzles: the game features only one icon for interaction (a magnifying lens) regardless of the nature or the direction of the said interaction. While this doesn't prevent puzzles from being solved (as they're not impossibly difficult anyway), it does nonetheless lack intutivity. Overall, Syberia II provides a fitting conclusion to Benoît Sokal's great duology (soon to be a trilogy, apparently). Its simple combination of a beautiful plot with elegant artwork makes Syberia II a necessary addition to adventure game collections even after more than a decade of its release.			"

												If you loved Syberia I you don't need me telling you to play this one too and if you didn't, well, then don't even try it. Syberia I promised a sequel with interesting new places and memorable characters and that's exactly what Syberia II delivered. The only thing is, it tied most, if not all, of its loose ends and that just makes you wonder what Syberia III could possibly be about. Whatever it is I'll be looking forward to it.			"

												A solid, but often frustrating, end to the Syberia saga. The two Syberia games form a coherent, long-winded, beautiful journey, and they should be played together. This game brings the Voralberg storyline to a pretty satisfying, if a little underwhelming, conclusion. I really grew fond of these characters, environments and Benoit Sokal's style of epic storytelling, and I was saddened to see it end. These games have some of the most memorable moments in adventure gaming history, even if the world feels a bit sterile.The animation and the graphics are slightly improved over the first game. The gameplay is pretty much identical, however. My biggest gripes remain with the UI and the puzzles: 1) Finding ""hot spots"" is often like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Oftentimes you get stuck because you missed a doorway or a box of crates in some remote corner. Ugh. I really recommend keeping an FAQ at hand... 2) Especially because the puzzles can be really opaque and strange. Some of the puzzles are very logical and satisfaying. On the upside, the game is not trying to hold your hand. Everything is abstract and solvable. But unfortunately, on the downside, some of the solutions require a bit of psychotic tinkering. (As far as a good FAQ is concerned, I highly recommend the spoiler-free (!) UHS hint system: http://www.uhs-hints.com/uhsweb/hints/syberia2/1.php)Those who have invested time into the first game should definitely see the story to its conclusion. If the disappointing aspects of the gameplay - frustrating UI and obtuse puzzles - had been mitigated, this would have been a masterpiece.Overall: 7/10			"

												Very good adventure game, although not as good as Syberia I.While Syberia II does improve on certain gameplay aspects like dialog, the main issue I have with this game is the puzzles, which in certain cases you have to come up with solutions for out of seemingly nothing, especially the last one.Everything else about the game(story, characters, soundtrack, etc...) remains excellent.Therefore, I still strongly recommend this game although if you found Syberia I's puzzles too difficult, you'll probably need a walkthrough for this one.

												Gorgeous sequel to Syberia. It was everything I expected and more. The story ending was moving and answered all questions. There were also some great gameplay improvements in relation to Syberia I. Quicker character movements, removal of dialogue options if you've exhausted them all- in comparison to repeatedly guessing in the first game as to whether or not you had asked all necessary questions, zero crashes, and SIGNIFICANT improvement in dialogue quality.I HIGHLY suggest that you play Syberia I first, and play Syberia II as soon as you complete the first. Helps keep the game fresh and alive, and is necessary if you want to enjoy gameplay as much as possible. Graphics are fantastic for the age of this game. It's rather like a child's fairytale book at times :) The adventures and gameplay locations are interesting and the characters are fun and blend well with the story. I thoroughly enjoyed Syberia II- and the ending was beautiful. Kate's journey to Syberia was just as much a journey of personal discovery. And it felt as though I was personally vested in seeing Hans live out his dream.Two thumbs up. Definitely a must for anyone who enjoys adventure games with engaging stories. I absolutely can't wait for the third installment coming out this year.			"

												Has not aged well. It looks and sounds decent enough but it's nonsensical, confusing, boring, and frustrating throughout.The hardest part about most of the puzzles is simply finding the clickable areas in the background. There's a lot of detail put into the scenes, but that means you have no way of telling by looking if this one patch of ground or pot will change the cursor to let you click on it. Kate Walker is appropriately named at least. Even if you don't miss anything, you will have her doing a LOT of walking. Or running.			"

You will visit poor steampunk villages, weird eskimo caves, plane wrecks and winter forests, all in search of mammoths.""Syberia II"" is good, has the same shortcomings as the first one: neverending stair or ladder climbing and some ""fetch quests"" that are just tedious walking through the same eleven screens again (unfortunately there is more of those than in the first game...). But there are exciting puzzles too. For example the ""Lemming Tunnel Problem"" :-) The game took me exactly the same time as Syberia I to complete.GRAPHICS: 8/10AUDIO: 8/10GAMEPLAY: 7/10STORY: 9/10			"

												Fine adventure game, much like the first one in the series. The story picks up at the end of Syberia I and follows Kate Walker as she helps Hans, and old man with a dream of finding the lost land of Syberia and its unusual inhabitants - the long gone mammoths. Along with Oscar, an automaton created by Hans, the trio follow a journey full with memorable characters, fantastic soundtrack and graphics (which, in my opinion, still hold up) and a story filled with unexpected turns of events along with a satisfying ending.As with every adventure game, a couple of puzzles are tough to crack and might take some pixel hunting to figure out but, thankfully, the number of time this happens is negligible (there's no rubber ducky puzzle).All in all, it's definitely a game worth playing for those who enjoy the adventure genre and played these kinds of games before, but also those new to it.Syberia 3 is scheduled to release later this year (2016) and I can't think of a better winter-themed series to play during the holidays.

												Syberia II picks up right after the first Syberia game, and the adventure of Kate Walker continues! The story focuses on her journey with Hans and his everlasting wish of finally reaching Syberia and seeing the mammoths. The game is once again filled with superb voice acting and an excellent musical score. If you enjoyed the original game you will have a blast to continue the story which is filled with surprises and is composed together very well; the game does a good job giving the player a feeling that they are fully absorbed into this world and are connected to the characters. The length of the sequel is around the same as the original which is around 8 hours. The game also once again shines with logical and well designed puzzles which makes this game an absolute joy to play.			"

Posted: February 17
												     I am a total sucker for adventure games. My love affair with them started way back with Colassal cave, Scott Adams Adventures, and the famous Infocom games. Back then things were text based. Wishbringer, Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy, Enchanter, Suspended, Planetfall, Bureaucracy, The Lurking HOrror, and the everpopular ZORK were among my favorites. Adventure games have one game play premise. The Barter System (and right now the This for That Schoolhouse Rock song is playing in my head).  But that is the essence of the system. I have this, I give this person THAT and get another thing in return or they do something for me. Thus I progress in the story.      Now the purpose really is to tell a fun and interesting story while loading up with these puzzle exchanges. Graphics adventures of the sort were inevitable. THe best known were the Sierra company's titles like the King's QUest series, thus the POINT AND CLICK adventure was born. Thus a problem. Instead of getting a description of a room and things you can pick up, you are given a picture and have to see that these blocky pictures are actually objects as well as that there are exits...and sometimes not. Sure you can hover over an area to see if you can interact, but therein lies the problem. You HAVE to make things logical enough so that people will not only be able to tell where to go and that there might be something you can pick up.      Syberia 2 suffers bigtime from both obstacles. It is a sequel to a previous Syberia game, but that doesn't really matter. YOu can pick up easily that the lead character Kate has been away from work for awhile...and never wants to return. She instead sets off on another journey with an elderly friend to find Syberia, a place of myth and legend. It's an intriguing beginning that basically leads nowhere fast. Like King's Quest V, it suffers from lots of illogic in tasks you must do. Give a alligator to this character to get a key? No that's an exaggeration but there are some of the puzzles like that. THere is a lot of bait and switch in it. Oh I need a small key to get through this door. Rats. It doesn't work I think. Am I doing this right? I need a coin for this contraption. I have many coins. They don't seem to work. I have no idea what to do now.      This uncertainty is there because of the gameplay engine. When you hover it is a bit ambivvalent in what's happening. It uses a weird symbol to indicate that you CAN'T do something that is small and unclear and most importantly unlabeled and uninstructed. There is NO instruction whatsoever in fact. So you will waste a lot of time, say....trying a key in a door and wondering what you are doing wrong, not totally realizing that....it's just the wrong key....go find another one. It doesn't tell you it is wrong in ways that are obvious. Other games have big eyeball icons for looking, speech ballon for talking, hand for grabbing. Can't really say I can identify what the cursor is doing at any particular time except that it changes. Another gameplay issue is objects. You can use objects in your inventory to interact with objects in a given location. That isn't really obvious either. Mixed with the obtuse icons and cursors it takes a bit to figure it out when a simple 1 minute training area would have taken care of this.     It also definitely lacks logic in that it won't let you say and do things that seem obvious. Example. You talk to someone. They have a broken thing. You have a long conversation about your goal, your traveling companion, his ability to invent and fix things and that the two character even KNOW each other. THen in the end nothing becomes of it. It is obvious that you should go back to your friend and talk to him to tell him to go fix the thing right? But when you do it doesn't give you that option. Why not? I think the characters stand around asking themselves that.     The characters are indeed very good characters, some a bit natural, some cartoony. The lead character especially is appealing. However most of the characters don't want to help you with anything. Then out of nowhere they do. Then instead of actually saying logical things that flow, they clam up simply waiting around...bored in their existance. They almost look like they are frustrated about having nothing interesting to say. Talking with someone is easy. Just click on them and it gives you a series of topics to discuss. But that soon becomes a complete grind. They recycle information SO MUCH within each topic. Nothing goes in sequential order. You can get 5 layers deep in ONE topic conversation only to be told the exact same thing 2 layers down in another. And those conversations seem to go on forever without really getting to the point.      I do like the characters in general. The stories of each person are fine and make you want to know them more. The lead character is appealing enough to easily get most people on her side. But....this game and story is a bit of a depressing downer right from the getgo. I love the beginning of how her bosses are worried about her and that she hasn't come back to the office. ""She's gone."" says one. Meaning...wanderlust has totally consumed her. She's a different person now and will never return. Kate does indeed to be fulfilling that role...trying to help her dying old inventor friend find the mythical Syberia. So good strong beginning instantly sent on a downward depressing spiral dealing with an elderly friend whose mind is not all there and whose health slowly declines...in fact there are a series of interactions and puzzles dealing specifically with that. I don't want to watch a man dying and have to go through a lot of things just to get him treated just to be told he's going to die. On the upside this is a world like MYST, like Likehouse. Full of robots and contrption. Granted it has this supercharged locatamotive run by a robot and still has to use coal. What's with that? It then goes through a town whose economy is nonexistent because it has no travelers or money coming in on the last stop to nowhere. No wonder all the characters just stand around fidgety waiting for something to happen (which never does)     Overall there is no brightness at all to this game. Not in puzzles, not in interaction, not in story, not in logic. THere are some things that you just happen upon and they work. THere are others you didn't even realize and never would have guessed. THen there is the problem of having to constantly go from one of a towen to the other to your train back again, etc. It's a grind. Not fun at all. Especially when location logic too seems to suffer. LEt's see if I go under the train track I should be here then back this way I'm at the stairs. No wait I'm now at an engine. BUt that should be over by the house. Location placement is a bit off and not logical either making that running grind worse. Putting things as far apart as possible just to lengthen gameplay and then confuse you in how to get there....is a very very bad idea.    At end, the only great thing to say about this is that the characters are well formed, the scenerey gorgeous, the voice acting is great, especially Kate and the pearshaped Russian guy that sounds like Boris Badenov from Bullwinkle.

												I'm rewriting this review even though no one cares because I feel so strongly about my non-recommendation that it deserves a stronger defense than I'd given in the prior rant.I own Syberia II because I got the bundle for cheap. If I'd bought them individually, I wouldn't have bothered with part 2, as part 1 put me to sleep. Even after I gave up and watched a Let's Play instead, THAT put me to sleep. To be fair, 2 is a little less narcolepsy-inducing, but not enough for me to keep going beyond ALMOST getting out of the first area.It's rather discouraging, because the reviews are overwhelmingly positive otherwise. Why do so many other people enjoy what feels like a very pretty but dull exploration game? Because that's what it feels like--the ""puzzles"" are a bit obtuse (having spent far too long trying to figure out the basic controls during part 1), and much of the solutions are just find SOMETHING to interact with and try everything. It's not even enjoyable watching Kate Walker... walk... and walk... and walk... and walk BACK... etc. I can think of so many games that have a world that FEELS larger in fewer screens, just because the amount of interactive content per ""room"" is so much higher, and the attention to details that convey character in and of themselves. Syberia overall has a lot of empty content for really no reason other than I guess the art department planned out a map and the programmers worked around that. At least in part 2 there are fewer doors for Kate to declare she won't even bother trying to open.Furthermore, I realized that what I don't like about this style of point-and-click game is the ""distant"" feel of the characters. Every dialogue is from at least twenty feet away, perspective-wise, so it's more like eavesdropping than actual interaction. There are no close-ups (other than the shadowy cutscenes in part 2), so I get no feel for the characters' emotions except through the (kinda bad) translated voice-acting, because they're as stiffly animated as puppets. The closest it got to providing any depth or emotion was how part 1 kept interrupting what little gameplay there was with random phone calls that only served to show how much nobody really respected Kate, while part 2 took a different tack and put in sorely-needed cinematics (that seemed to inflate Kate's importance far above and beyond her original ""buy a toy factory"" job... but then I fell asleep through half the story to fully appreciate the drama).It's not like 3D can't accommodate the kind of character animation that 2D can provide easily--just look at any Telltale Games game (Sam & Max, The Wolf Among Us) or even a game like Ankh or the Gabriel Knight 20th Anniversary remake... though the GK remake admittedly feels as clunky as Syberia, the interview sections and cutscenes still draw the player out of ""watch from a distance like a creepy stalker"" mode enough to convey a real sense of who the characters are.Yes, I get that they were going for this realistic world to explore, and they've done a good job of that. Once I've seen a room once, though, it gets boring seeing it about fifty more times in trying to progress the story.tl;dr: Just watch a walkthrough on Youtube, it's a lot less clicking.			"

												This is the second and final game of Syberia and must be played after the first game for full experience. The story continues from Syberia 1, Kate has decided to help Hans get to his goal and of course the path there is winding with plenty of obstacles and puzzles. It should be played with a guide available as some puzzles seem far-fetched. It has the same nostalgic feeling as the first game, and is similar in art style, storytelling and puzzle type. The landscapes look good, the voice acting, sound effects and music are good. The graphics on characters and objects look dated because they are. Play it with nostalgia.

												Yes, you should buy this game. I played the first Syberia many years ago and I have always wished to come across another game like it, so when I saw Syberia II - wow! I was so happy and I have to admit, I'm pleased. Pros: 1.) The graphics are the best I've ever seen for  PNC game. My bf even compared it to Skyrim quality - not bad, not bad. 2.) This story is better than the first game. I think this is because Kate has companions in this game, so she feels more likeable and you also get to know the other characters more because well, you're with Hans and Oscar for a LONG time. 3.) Puzzles range from easy to very difficult. The variation is quite nice. 4.) If you left Syberia, feeling incomplete, this will help round it out for you!Cons:1.) Some items in this game are really hard to find. At one point you have to find dry wood to create a fire and it's almost impossible to find it. It also irritating because you're in a forest, yet you have to click in the EXACT right spot to find the item. Annoying. 2.) A few puzzles in this game arevery, very difficult, and no, common sense won't help you. Overall, I'm very happy with this sequel. Score: 9/10			"

												Syberia 2 despite being a very good game doesnt live up to the standard from the first one. You can easily face the both games a just one huge story, it continues te story where it left of the first one insted of a complete new plot. For me the mais issue here is that the first game were very friendly to non-adventure fans like myself, with puzzles that are compelling with the right level of difficulty, without need to appel to some dumb hint systems or something like it.The second games comed up with some major bumps in the pacing like the Horse puzzle or the  Fishing Puzzle that are kind of unfair and complety clueless and seems a little bit unfair to the player.

												The first game for the most part had no villain, no antagonist other than the need to wind up your train. This sequel (which seems more like a part-two than a proper sequel) introduced an annoying, one-dimensional pair of them: a big dumb oaf and a sniggering pervert.The first game established a pattern: go on an adventure to get your train wound up, then ride it to the next stop. This sequel does that once before wrapping it up with a climax and resolution.Is it a good continuation of the first game? Yes. Is it beautiful, building on the first game? Yes. Is it a good game in its own right? Sadly, no.If you loved the first game and wish it hadn’t ended so soon, play this now! If you’re planning to get the first game and wondering whether to get the bundle, get the bundle. This is a great coda to Syberia. The only reason I’m dis-recommending it is because it’s not a good standalone game.			"

												So much of the games puzzles and story make no sense, that a walkthrough was constantly needed. Some puzzles have no in game explaination, and yet require a specific sequence of buttons to be pressed.Certainly not a game for anyone wanting a real story game. The story is hollow and shallow, and often makes no sense at all.Also you will never again forget the name of the main character, as nearly every sentence anyone spoke to her includes her FULL NAME! First and last name... really? Yes, it is true.This game also has a big problem with naming things. Sometimes naming strange, fictional things, with the same name as something real, only with a slight spelling difference(Syberia, not Siberia). Or naming a strange fictional seal-dog animal race with almost the same name as the strange nomadic people you're trying to reach(Youki is a dog thing, Youkol is a race of nomadic people). This becomes VERY confusing.There is also some kind of a start of a story thing with the main characters former boss sending someone to try to find her, because her mom is 'making him' ( 'him' being some head cheese of a giant law firm or something, why he'd listen to some lady about one of his employee's who decided to run away, I don't know.) Overall this part of a story piece helped nothing with the game, and seemed only to be a sad way of trying to make it seem like she was embarking on this IMPOSSIBLE journey, since the expert he hires to try to find her just can't do it, it's to hard.Overall, this game was a terrible disappointment. Back when this game was new, I'm sure it would have been 'top notch', but now it's just confusing, boring, and very aggravating.			"

												A very good point-and-click game on its own but a step-down from the original Syberia. The puzzles were ridiculously hard and I found it hard to empathize with characters. Not to mention the ending was abrupt and left a lot to desire.Regardless, it is a worthy sequel to Syberia but I would most definitely recommend the first game if anyone is looking to jump into this genre. The story is great!			"

												Overall score: 9.5 out of 10This second part of Syberia has improved on many levels, not only the graphics are more beautiful and more dynamic, but also the gameplay is a lot smoother and finally the circle that you use to move Kate has an arrow pointing the direction, in the first part it was sometimes annoying not knowning the direction where Kate is going. The puzzles are also a bit harder, but not very difficult, even though some of them require a lot of observation and attention to details. So if everything is better, why I didn't gave a 10 to Syberia II, well, it's because of the puzzles, not because I found them too difficult or too easy, but because sometimes their simplicity is hidden by stupid details, like for example the radar puzzle to eject Kate, it was so simple, but the fact that first we used some numbers to contact the colonel, induced me in error thinking that the puzzle is difficult and that I have to do some calculations, all because the first numbers that I used to contact the colonel had no relevance to the radar display whatsoever, while the second numbers that I needed to find where related to the radar display. Also there are other puzzles that can induce you in error and you can waste a lot of time because they need another puzzle to be completed first and it's quite difficult to know that.  The final puzzle it might be extremely difficult if you don't pay attention to some details long time before you reach that puzzle, I didn't had too much problem with the last one but I struggled with some very simple puzzle just because the answer was completly hidden in the background. Anyway the game is awesome and the story ends quite good, although I would like to know how Kate made it back in New York. 100 % Recommended "

												There are many parallels between Syberia and Still Life.  The way the game works, the puzzles, the characters…  The first game in each series were at times, hard but somewhat fair.  The sequels, however, sucked.Syberia 2... without a doubt, one of the worse games I have ever played.  As I just stated, Syberia 1 wasn’t too bad.  The puzzles were somewhat vague but you did have an idea of what you had to do, even if it didn’t make a lot of sense.Syberia 2 however… Good Lord.  Talk about confusing.  Most, if not all, of the more complex puzzles are so ambiguous, that there is no way you will solve them without help.  When you do solve some of these puzzles, (after looking up the answer in the internet) you realize that the process you were forced to do makes no sense at all.I would not recommend this game to anyone unless you want to purposely antagonize someone you don‘t like.

												I really wanted to recommend this game, but I won't. There was improvement with the dialogue system but, unlike some people have pointed out, I did think that such difficult puzzles spoiled my experiencing of the story and I'd have to spend ages on the same spot if I wanted to figure them out on my own. Referring to a walkthrough more than just once in a while in order to complete a game can be very frustrating, not to mention the great amount of visual memory (and PATIENCE) required to solve the puzzles; otherwise you'd have to walk back and forth, over and over, halfway through the entire game scenery... and back again. Making the puzzles complicated doesn't necessarily make them clever. More than once did I check the walkthrough guidelines and went, ""Oh, come on!!!"" I couldn't even get involved in the story; it dragged on forever, I just wanted it to end! Glad it finally did.Nice ending, though.			"

												Couple Warnings:1) This review covers both Syberia games.2) While I'm saying I don't recommend it, I'm not saying it's a bad game. Hear me out, here. Not too long ago they had the ""Syberia Bundle"" on sale, so I thought I'd buy it with nothing to lose. It couldn't be that bad, if there's another sequel on the way, right? Again, as an adventure game, it's not bad. In fact, I think it did pretty good at setting up some challenging puzzles. But it's also nothing special. In a game like this, solving a puzzle is supposed to mean advancing the plot, but this game has barely enough plot to write a single novella, even if you use 100% of content from both Syberia games. Here's a quick TL;DR: 1) The plot is weak and nonsensical.2) World building and character development were thrown out the window altogether. You just have to take everyone's word for it that ""Kate's Changed,"" because I can't tell a difference.3) The game features some glaring samples of bad level design, forcing the player to deal with issues that game devs had known were bad ideas for at least a decade before. ((((SPOILER)))) Plot of the first game can be summed up as ""Young Lawyer Kate Walker goes to France to finalize paperwork on an automaton factory's takeover after the owner dies. However, the owner reveals in her will that her brother was still alive, and therefore she wants all her assets sent to him. All things considered, this should have still been the end of Kate's job, but her boss tells her not to come home until she gets that paperwork signed, so she travels to Russia hoping that just sort of maybe this brother will be there. On her way, we learn that her boss is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that her boyfriend is cheating on her with her best friend. All things considered, it's somewhat understandable that she chooses to run away with this brother, Hans, once she finally meets him."" Sure, there's a train whose engineer is a robot who is your companion, but he refuses to lift a finger to assist in any way beyond ""drive the train."" Second game, Kate's traveling with Oscar the robot train driver and Hans the mammoth-obsessed idiot whose only redeeming feature is his ability to make Automatons. Hans gets sick and nearly dies, but he gets better after killing Oscar and turning his body into a brace. In the end, you make it to the magical island of Syberia, where wooly mammoths are still alive. ((((END SPOILER))))Considering what I know about the story so far, Syberia III is most likely going to just be ""Kate goes back to civilization after completing her journey"" and that's all we're going to get. And the worst part is, Kate's motivation is never clear. If these games made anything clear about her, it's that she isn't an idiot by any stretch of the imagination. Plus she was a lawyer. She knew her rights. She knew that her boss couldn't exactly fire her just because he didn't know all the facts before sending her into the field and it turns out the situation was more complicated than they expected. If she loved her job so much that she was willing to travel from France to Russia just to get one document signed, she would have known that travelling from France to Russia alone with no help was beyond her job description. Why the hell did she decide to throw away her relationships just to make her ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss happy?My other major complaint about the game is that there is next to no world building or character development, although I guess I already talked about poor character development. One of the main staples of point and click adventure games is that you can click on things to learn about them, or at least what the character knows about it. This helps you understand your environment and your character, but it's something that was sorely lacking from this game. Even some of those stupid Putt Putt and Freddie Fish games from the late 90's/early 2000's for kids 6 and under (which I played when I was 6 and under) did a better job of this, and they did it for an audience with a much shorter attention span. This game was for the 16-20 audience, and failed to deliver on one of the simplest questions anyone could ask of a story: ""Why should I care?"" Due to the fact you're surrounded by  strange devices, the sci-fi loving part of me cared from the first cutscene, but I could never rationalize caring beyond that. Lastly, although I've said many times that the game aspect was good, this game is the poster child for bad level design. In Syberia I, you are forced to run from one area to another multiple times, and half the areas in between bear no relevance to solving any puzzles or continuing the story. In Syberia II, they don't fix it. In fact, the only thing that got an update as far as I could tell was the layout of the train interior. That made no sense to update, though, since there would have been no time or reason for our characters to renovate it. I mean, Syberia II picks up one stop after Syberia I as far as I can tell. But that's the biggest gripe I think you can throw at any game series: This was a problem in the first game. You didn't fix it. Last thing. You know how the bullet points here on Steam say that the game has ""Rich and intriguing new characters with new, realistically detailed 3D environments?"" ignoring the game's age, I can't tell a difference between the graphics from the first game and the  second game. Also, the new characters? One's a dog, the other's a thief who follows you. I will say, though, that the dog is a good boy. I regret to say that once Syberia III costs 12.99 or less, I'll probably cave and buy it as well, but I can't see it being anything other than a quick cash grab.			"

												Played: Feb 2014PROS:+ More cinematics+ Voice acting better than episode I+ Does not have the graphics problem episode I had with switching to windowed mode in-gameCONS:- Story STILL does not go anywhere- Voice acting (English) still a bit sillyREVIEW: Let’s be honest: if I hadn’t purchased Syberia II along with Syberia I as a super-cheap combo pack, I wouldn’t have bothered at all. Everything that is “good” about Syberia II is only relatively good when compared with the terrible Syberia I; there is nothing superlative about any facet of this game.A good thing about this game is that it has more cinematics than its predecessor. A game that sells itself on story should have many movies, and there are some here. For a game released in 2004 the visuals are not bad, but they haven’t aged well at all and alone they shouldn’t induce you to buy this game. Furthermore, the voice acting won’t make you wince as often; as when intonation is way of or a word is mispronounced, but you will definitely notice strange moments in the dialogue.The main draw of this game is supposed to be the “amazing story” but here is the problem: it never develops beyond the premise that your protagonist wants to help an old guy reach Syberia (and still features the intelligence-insulting idea that he couldn't have gotten there when he built the rails the first time).In general, stories depend on the quality of conflict for their weight, and the weak opposition and half-sketched puzzles (either extremely easy or nonsensical due to total lack of clues) simply don’t contribute any to a satisfying conclusion. It’s more like you progress through a series of trivial events and the game stops. Even in its most pretentious moments trying to induce pathos, the characters never manage to be any more impactful than a mildly annoying fly at the dinner table.So what should induce you to buy this game? I can only imagine it must be the inflated ratings it seems to be getting elsewhere (why I tried when both games together were $3). Don’t bother unless you have time to waste and the patience of Job for flimsy characters (slightly less) annoyingly voiced.SPOILER PLOT COMPLAINT: One more thing I could leave off here-I couldn't believe it but the developers actually show you going so far north that you see Antarctic Emperor Penguins. Come on, were they complete idiots, or did they just think I'm one?REBUTTAL TO COMMENTS:On the contrary, the first game sets up a (boring) storyline which the second fails to resolve satisfactorily. I am seriously surprised you are defending the storyline; clearly I am not the one who hasn't put much thought into what is going on. Problems with the second story are significant and in actuality are catastrophic, ruining what little immersion you got in the first game.Premise of the First Game: A lawyer tries to find an idiot savant because it is buisness. She has a domineering mother and a needy boyfriend that she becomes increasingly distant from. She finds said idiot and decides to escort him (reasons are ambiguous but could possibly be construed as the ""adventure and unknown"" crap espoused). Game ends.Premise of Second Game: Having made the decision to escort the idiot savant to a location he has already built a train to, said person (no longer identified as a lawyer) solves breakdowns in said idiot's equipment (in spite of the fact that he is the ""genius"" that built it and presumably understands how to fix it)Protagonist overcomes resistance by enemies who have no clear reasons to oppose you.Protagonist makes ""a tough ethical decision"" to eliminate one of the most annoying side characters ever invented in order to help the idiot savant keep goingProtagonist gets idiot savant to final destination where he rides off into the sunset.Adventure over More Criticisms of Second Game: The game tries to give you catharsis by helping a fool achieve his life's dream, but it fails because he isn't credible as a character and neither is the protagonist, who is no longer motivated by escape (her motivation in part 2 is actually never further explained than ""gee, I want to help this stranger out""). Enemies are less than two dimensional because they have zero motivation to oppose you, so they simply aren't believable. You deal with offensively stupid indigenous peoples and animals that literally could not live further from your proposed location. You seriously think those are the makings of a great game? This story was clearly written by the same 12-year-olds defending it below. "

												Really enjoyed the Syberia series. Very fun and entertaining with an intriging story. However when catching fish it is the most tedious and boring running around until you find the correct one. You cannot simply throw the fish away you have to run back and forth to feed it to the bear. Super boring and annoying. Cant even cut the cinematics...			"

												8/10 The graphics and movement were better than the original Syberia, but I liked the storyline and gameplay of the original better. This one seemed to end a little abruptly, and I wasn't as happy with the ending (though this may just be in the eye of the beholder). I still had a lot of fun playing it, and hope that a Syberia 3 comes out someday. I would definitely recommend this game to any point and click enthusiast as well as someone who had played Syberia 1 and liked it. If you're considering whether or not to get the bundle or buy the games separately, I would get the bundle. Both games are a lot of fun, and you can't play one without finishing the other.			"

												Unfortunately, the devs took the worst aspect of Syberia and *emphasized* it in Syberia 2: the entire game is designed around assuming that the only ""right"" way to approach solving a problem is by thinking the same way the devs do, so all you get is mounting frustration as Kate refuses to do what seems ""obvious"" to you, particularly in the form of dialog choices.  Also bad: the game keeps violating Chekhov's Gun, where game elements are not present until you need them, so you will vet an area as empty, then solve a puzzle, and have no reason to realize that the heretofore empty area now has the next element you need to pick up.Stay away, and play a GOOD point and click, like Dreamfall.

												This review is based on technical issues for Mac so may not apply to PC users.Likely due to it being an older game just recently made available for Mac, I received no technical support. The tech support e-mail given by Steam is no longer operating (you get a returned email) and they don't respond via their website. Because it's an older game there isn't much help from other players through forums, either.The bugs were significant enough to prevent me from playing at all (could not save game, for example, so I had to start at the beginning every time or leave the game running in the background). Since I bought this on sale for just a few dollars it's not a great loss, but I definitely wouldn't recommend taking the risk at full price.			"

												I'm glad I played Syberia and Syberia II, since I missed them during their original releases, but would only recommend them for others lacking any nostalgic affection for them who appreciate playing older games for the academic exposure to earlier era gaming. The story is lacking and wastes a promising steampunk atmosphere, characters are comically imbecile and have horribly awkward dialogue, and the relatively small number of puzzles more tedious than challenging. I would recommend the first game over its sequel tenfold.			"

												First, I will say I haven't played the original Siberia. However, I did not enjoy this game. There was so much potential for a great storyline to match the mysterious, exciting, adventurous atmosphere of the game but it just fell short in every possible way. I found much of what was required of me to be very unintuitive (to the point where I was completely annoyed by the end of the game and was SO GLAD to be done with it). Second, the story ends a bit abruptly to me.In short, the game has great atmosphere but it isn't enought to make up for the unexplored storyline and unintuitively frustrating puzzles, etc.			"

												i guess you have to finish the story. It would have been so much better if they hadn't cut the game into 2 episodes. Unlike in the first game, in Syberia II there won't be any diversity in places and characters. Having to take care of an annoying, sick old man, having to deal with 2 really dumb villains. You won't even care about the ending, you'll just be glad it's over. Syberia 2 have none of the charm you saw in its prequel. Also, it's shorter. It was a huge disappointment for me. Get it when it's on sale, or dont buy it at all, it sure as hell isn't worth the full price.			"

												I played the first game as well because I bought both in a pack. I was hoping some things would improve but it was pretty well exactly the same for problems I had with the first one. Good graphics, challenging puzzles, captivating storyline. What I didnt like about this game - lots of sections where you could walk to the edge of the screen, but there was no sign of that from the mouse (meaning it only lit up in certain spots telling you to go there but not in others), you had to figure it out yourself and that got me stuck a few times not knowing where to go. Also, there were a lot of sections to walk thtough that were pointless. Couldn't pick anything up, couldn't do anything in them. They were jus there for graphics and when you are running back and forth trying to figure out a puzzle thats a pain. I like challenging puzzles but some of the puzzles were insane and there was no hint option or anything which I also didn't like. Wouldn't play the series again.			"

												Walking simulator pretending to be a puzzle game. Get Dreamfall or Ether One instead.Syberia 1 was good, tedious at times but good. This one... so much walking. I'm actually playing other  games on my phone while waiting for the aptly named Ms Walker to walk to her next destination. After about 45 minutes of gameplay I mostly stopped listening to the conversations she has with the AI because I'm getting further with guessing than following the conversational clues and cues.I got it on sale bundled, I don't recommend buying it otherwise. At least it has trading cards.For the first 20 minutes of Syberia 1 I did not know running was possible but, still, I persevered and I finished it, and enjoyed it (mostly). When I saw that I could run in Syberia 2 I was elated... then really disappointed that it was still so slow.Each screen has a set number of steps that it takes to get across before it switches to the next one and it starts all over again - cross the screen, switch to new screen,cross the screen, switch to new screen, cross the screen, switch to new screen, end up at a screen where you have to do one thing and then make your way back the way you've just come.The issue is that so many of the screens are just ornamental. And when you have to pass through four screens of pointless (but good looking and enjoyable at least twice) scenery for the fifth time just to check on if you might have missed something before having to run back the same way... that's not fun.Walking simulator, power-walking simulator, scenery simulator - still not fun.

And why do I say that? Because if you talk to a person and say one thing wrong, you have to start over... the ENTIRE GAME. That's right, although it's ""open-world"", you can't really play it in any certain order. You HAVE to talk to people in a certain pre-determined order and there's no way of knowing how to do something (tutorials, quest menus etc.), and if you don't, nothing happens with the quest and you'll be unable to proceed. DON'T BUY!! Unless you're a filthy casual player.. in that case, have fun with your broken game. Not to mention that there are grammatical errors..2,7/10			"

												It might be a good game but who knows I dont know what to do after getting off the train. Im apparently suppose to wind the train but thats all it tells me. Not what is missing, who is responsible for breaking the winder thing, where the part is to repair it or anything. So I just kida stole some candy and money from the only guy in town. In short it looks more like a mash evreything till something works game than a puzzle game.			"

												After being pleasently surprised by the original Syberia I was excited to see where II would take the story. While I also enjoyed this sequel, it didn't quite elicit the same emotions as the first. The environments are impressive, just the story wasn't quite as interesting as the first I found. However, definitely still an enjoyable point and click adventure.			"

												Excellent storyline, it keeps you wanting more so am looking forward to Syberia 3! (tbc release date 2015)Pros:-Detail-rich graphics leave you admiring every scene, and contain steam-punk elements, all set against eerie snowy landscapes that are Russian and Inuit-esque.-More fictional history about the Youkols added further depth and intrigue, in particular epitomised in my favourite scenes involving the dream sequence and spirit woman.-Captivating and imaginative storyline with many architecturally-beatiful places to explore, it was great to see some of the same characters again while meeting totally new ones.was very sad re Oscar!-Better gameplay; Kate's movements are less clunky and running from scene to scene is less cumbersome than the first-Music and ambiance were really effective, I found myself completely in the game's environment for the most part (aka the surprise bear attack!)-Puzzles were interesting, more challenging than the first but not impossible.-The Youki was adorable <3 A seal-puppy hybrid is always a positive in my book!Cons:-Dialogue needed some work, exchanges between characters lacked some individuality and fun.  -Kate's character can be a tad bland at times, could be injected with a bit more humour or attitude as I found myself saying things that another person may in a given situation e.g. Bourgoff brothers acted awfully so I assumed she'd be a little more receptive to that!-There wasn't as much urgency re plot as the first so didn't feel as much momentum.Regardless, I still loved this game, a high 9/10.

												Fun point-and-click adventure game to pass the time. The puzzles aren't terribly difficult but the storyline is interesting and will keep you immersed. Definitely worth playing if you like the genre or have completed the first Syberia. There's a cinematic recap of the first Syberia you can launch from the game to refresh your memory if you haven't played the first one in a while. The dialog can be a little cheesy at times though. Not sure why they felt the need to repeat the main character's full name every other sentence. Kate Walker, Kate Walker...Kate Walker? Kate Walker! "

												The  successor to the legendary Syberia.The game completely follows the logic of the first Syberia.For once more Benoit Sokal wants us to follow him to the end of the trip of Hans Voralberg, which purpose is finding the last mammoths. A very good game,too, but nothing more from the original.The Graphics here are a bit better and it has to be the resolution. The original was probably made in 800x600 and Syberia 2 in 1024x768. If not then the textures are better. But there is a great difference in the look. This game is full cinematic too. Of course, it will never look as a modern game.. That's why a remake HAS to be made.Voices and sounds are exceptional and of culture.The riddle system is supposed to be the same. But the game instead of the first one has some tiresome riddles without meaning. If you found yourself stucked you may have missed something obvious. The bad thing with the game is that the places have great range and are many. Without the option to change a place instantly by double-clicking on the door that you find in modern games, missing something is totally tiresome. And in this game you'll find many cases that you missed something because there is NO hot spot help as an old game it is. So, the game is NOT difficult at all. You just have to look all around the areas you go carefully.The landscapes still are great but because of the resolution I couldn't make a screenshot. But they are really amazing! You'll find yourself in a world based on north Russia in the start of the game and later on who really knows,to an eskimos(we could call them) village below the ice and in the frozen seas of the Arctic Ocean. When finally you find your destination the landscapes look as those of Amerzone(Jungle) another Benoit Sokal's game.The story continues from the original.It still is between reality and fantastic with more focus in reality. You'll get across different civilizations and you'll be through their culture in medicine, life, gods and many more. It's really good for a successor to keep you up. Believe me. At this point you'll never been bored. Just try NOT to miss things like we said...A GREAT successor to the original. We hope to see Syberia 3[www.syberia.microids.com] coming.			"

												Unfortunately, especially for me, the sequel to Syberia really isn't as good as the original.The big thing is that it lacks the atmosphere of the original, which is probably the biggest factor in the original being so good. Why did it lack it? There's a bunch of reasons. The soundtrack isn't as catching, imagery isn't as distinctive (due to all the snow), seemingly more stilted dialogue/VA, and etc. The game also includes a subplot which, frankly, is more distracting than complimenting.Another big reason is that there aren't as many locations. The original Syberia has four distinct locations -- Syberia 2 has two. Both games have areas 'in-between', but, even then, the 'in-between' areas of the original carried a far stronger impression because there is more unique imagery. The 'in-between' areas of Syberia 2 is mostly bland snow.So all of the above combined to dramatically decreased the atmosphere of Syberia 2 to its detriment. However, I still recommend it for fans of the original because the game is a major plot continuation of the story from the first game. I suppose if you don't care for the original's story, that won't matter, but I grew to love Kate/Oscar/Hans so I really wanted to know what happens next.On its own, I honestly wouldn't recommend it, but if you love the original and/or, like me, preparing for the upcoming release of Syberia 3, this game would be a worthy purchase.

To me though the game still is alot of fun and would recommnd this to point and click puzzlers with rich story lines. It's no Myst but its still really cool lol			"

												The story itself is good (in my opinion you really gotta play the 1st one to understand/get the feelings for the 2nd).The arts, Characters & Story, Were great, But the ""puzzles"" were REALLY FRUSTRATEING, Most things i managed to solve by walkin/running around doing stuff, But the more 1-screen-puzzles, I just couldnt complete, Even with clues found ingame and scribbleing notes n drawings on paper to try figure stuff-out, Trying my absolute best to try solve it, But in the end 9/10 times i ended up looking at walkthroughs, As it just was impossible to figure out, Several of those kind of puzzles were example press a random asortment of loads of buttons until something happend.Altho, Even that the puzzles were basicly impossible to solve without walkthroughs (unless you are some kind of Genius or a Wizard). I still highly recommend the game, Due to the story and feelz. Looking forward to the 3rd game.			"

												The sequel to the first Syberia.  This game follows the events immediately after the first one, which is really nice because in that way you don't miss anything.  The grahics, game play and story is really good.I had a few problems with the in-game video's that stopped the game, but luckily when you skip them you can continue playing.Golden rule:  Save your game a lot!  Especially just before attempting a puzzle (some of the puzzles are quite challenging).  Just in case you mess it up - if you do, just restore your game, to save yourself some extra hassles :-)I really enjoyed this game, just as much as the first one.  This one did feel a little shorter than the first game though.It would be really interesting to see what Syberia III has in store...			"

												Kate Walker is a terrible womanchild.The game picks up where the last one ended; Kate follows Hans to Syberia. Syberia II is for fans that weren't frustrated with Kate's decision in the end of the first game. But I guess there would be no sequel if that decision wasn't made.  The gameplay is worse than the first game. They have removed the icons for clickable items on the screen  and now you must follow if Kate is glaring at a particular direction in the world to see if you can interact with an object. Or just pixel hunt. This is frustrating because if you miss an item then you have to go back and look for it without being able to fast forward to that place.  Most of the puzzles are trial and error apart from the penultimate. So in conclusion, way more casual than the first one, better cutscenes, beautiful artwork, frustrating gameplay. Story doesn't add anything new apart from introducing more eerie moments. It is an enjoyable journey for the fans overall. Non-Syberia fans should skip this. PS. I really hope the 3rd one makes Kate Walker more mature in decision making. Maybe she finally returns home to her mother? And I would not mind a Film adaptation of the Syberia universe tbh.			"

												I recently played both Syberia I and II. Perhaps Syberia II is less ""atmospheric,"" as some have criticized, but it's still more of the same. A continuation of the story. The subplot is a lot weaker this time, but if you enjoyed Syberia I and wandering around well realized fantasy environments, and solving mostly fairly simple puzzles, then it's certainly worth playing.

												The second Syberia has graphics which did not age well (similar to the first of the series)- but give it a shot.P&C puzzles are fun and challengingI advise to play it in French (if you can) as the game is Designed by Benoît Sokal, a Belgian comic artist and video game developer.  :-D			"

												Great game where you'll find yourself getting immersed into the story and rooting for the main character. I find this game to be much smoother to play than the first seeing as the majority of the time is spent running around and praying you didn't miss anything important. However, there was definitely a lack in awe and wonder since the discovery of the characters occurs in the original game. All in all though, it nicely wrapped up the mystery of the story and felt completed. I only wonder what they have left to cover in the third installment of the series coming in December.			"

												Loved the game, loved the story and the ethereal atmosphere of the game. All dialogues can be clicked through for the impatient, you can double click to go somewhere without watching your character walk the whole way.Good amount of problem solving, though Ill admit, i personally needed the aide of a walkthrough once in a while.The first Syberia is equally excellent, and I defintiely recommend playing it first or the story will not have quite the same impact or make as much sense.A must play for people who like the mystery solving genre of game.Mammoths are my favorite animal now.

Did she go back to New York? or back to the youkols? or is she going to find a new journey all on her own. I will truely miss one of the characters (i almost cried twice in this game) but over all i would recommend this game to everyone!!!			"

												Shame it's not as good as the 1st game, however it's still very good.I like the better control with the mouse, just wish I had more closure in more of the open ended story. Maybe this is what brings people to the series of games? Always seems to be on offer so worth a few quid, even retail cost is not bad, a must for any point-and-click lover.			"

												Rage has motivated me to write something here.  I originally bought this game on the PlayStation 3.  Do not, for any reason, buy the PS3 version.  It is atrocious.  The sound constantly cuts in and out. Visual glitches abound.  The text boxes are slow and annoying.  The controls are clunky.  The screen transitions are the opposite of smooth.  Visuals aren't as pretty.  After enduring about 20 minutes of this garbage, I immediately bought the game on Steam, started playing, and found myself filled with joy.  Whoever the shiz was in charge of the PS3 port should be ashamed for ruining a fantastic game.As for the PC version of this game, if you are a fan of the point-and-click adventure genre, I don't see how you won't enjoy this game.Update on September 1, 2015: I just finished this game, never used a walkthrough.  This one is tougher than the first game.  The story isn't compelling like it is in the first game.  It's a bit goofy at times, and there are some ""Whaaaa?"" moments.  The scenes from ""back at the office"" are out of place and contrived.  But this is still a great point-and-click adventure game.  The snowy scenery is beautiful.  The puzzles are hard in a (mostly) good way.  8/10, would abandon man to murderous penguins again.			"

												Just finished playin Syberia 2 and it was breathtaking. The controls are so much better and the storyline gets more and more interesting. I'm not quite satisfied with the ending though. It seemed as though something was lacking but overall, the relationships posed inside the game gave me endearing memories to smile about.			"

												Overall, thumbs up.It is pretty much a linear story driven game.  You explore to find the pieces needed to get to the next scene in the game.  Great storyline.  Good visuals and entertaining characters.  Controls are easy enough.  It felt like it was too slow getting anything done though.  The story kept me coming back for more, but criss crossing the various scenes to bring items to right places was frustrating.  Despite this, the story kept me coming back for more.			"

												I can only agree with the ones saying that this is for you, if you like Syberia 1 and are ok with a bit more challenging puzzles.Technically speaking I was able to run it under Windows 10 with absolutely no problems. The resolution is not that high, but I forced it to use antialising and filtering through my GeForce panel and that helped a lot.			"

												A great follow up to Cyberia. The exciting feel of something fresh and new that I felt with Cyberia is somewhat diminished during playing the second part, but the world is so immersive that I was happy as hell playing this. The game is also somewhat shorter than the first one, if you have good problem solving skills you should be able to do this in one day.Animations are quicker so you don't loose time watching Kate going up&down the stairs like an old lady like in the first game. Some minor improvements have been also made, like the conversation list updating and hiding topics that can't be discussed further at that point, and so on.Puzzles are still fairly clear and manageable by yourself. Sadly there are also puzzles that the game does not give you any hints on how to do, and important objects are still not lit or highlighted in any way. You can end up searching little pieces for hours because of this, and can't progress until you find them. I also noticed one ""bug"" that can ruin the game, so saving the game is very advisable, at least in the beginning of levels.So while I gave Cyberia something like 4.5/5, I give this 4/5.+Story, scenery, atmosphere, characters+puzzles-a few puzzles feel annoying and illogical-story is somewhat short+-music isn't as good as in the first game in my opinion. In the first there were times I just listened because the beautiful music took my attention. I didn't notice that with this sequel.			"

												After playing this game, I honestly feel the story could have easily, and maybe should have stopped with the end of Syberia 1. I'm not saying this game wasn't good, but I feel Kate's arc really developed and ultimately crescendos in the final scene of the first game and maybe that storyline was more important than the journey. She doesn't really need this game because her story was, in essence, over. The story felt less important to me because instead of acting on your main character's motivations you are doing this for Hans, who is a one dimensional character, thus making the games progression very predictable and it doesn't feel as much like an adventure as just wrapping up the subplot in the first game.But this game was made and of course I played it, needing to know what happened next. I recommend it to fans of the first game because it adds a satisfying closure to the tales of Hans, Oscar, and the Youkol people. The cast of new character introduced in this game were not as memorable as the first, except for Youki. The 'bad guys' seemed to be shoehorned in just to get the train to stop at a couple extra location and I felt they ultimately detract from the story.The game continues directly after the first, also featuring identical gameplay. You will read journals that outline the history of locations and using these to clue into the answer to the puzzles and slowly jog between screen after screen just to find out you need to backtrack. The backdrops were not quite as good but there are still some interesting areas.			"

												Even better than Syberia 2, we follow Kate Walker as she helps Hans reach his final destination. With much improved graphics (that still holds up pretty well even today) and a musical score to match, this game has excellent story telling and solid puzzles to keep you interested throughout.They upgraded the conversation tree, so when you are interacting with other characters in the game, the conversation dissappears from your choices you can be made, that way you aren't asking the same thing over and over. Helps keep the game moving. There are more puzzles that offer more of a challenge and more characters to interact with along with better laid out places to visit. the cutscenes are even better and more frequent thoughout the game as well.  An overall excellent game with an excellent ending.They said this would be the last Kate Walker adventure for her, but coming next year(2017) is Syberia 3, so I am very much ready to see what is next. So if you haven't tried these games, now is the time.			"

												Sequal to one of my favourite games ever!!  It is not quite as good as the original but still fantastic.  The gameplay is not as light as the original and it is a lot colder.  There were a couple of puzzles that left me scratching my head, even after playing it at least a dozen times since I bought it, when it was first released.I still love this game so much that I actually have it on PC, PS & iPad.Am super excited that a third game is coming out!

												The conclusion to the story started in Syberia I.  Note that this is the second half of the story and starts exactly where Syberia I left off.  Also, note that Syberia I does not have a conclusion.  You have to play this one to find out what happens.As with Syberia I, a fairly decent adventure game and a good one for beginners.  It has a creative plot and some intriguing ideas.  Most of what I say in my review of Syberia I pertains.My only sadness is that they got rid of the system in which it shows you what you can click on, which I really liked.  In Syberia II, you don't know what you can click on, and that bugs me, because it means that you can fall prey to the infamous I-couldn't-figure-out-the-problem-because-I-didn't-know-I-could-click-there problem.  I mean, what if the thing in question is so small you can barely even see it on the screen?However, most of the problems are pretty good and do not have this issue, so they can be forgiven for changing their interface.  All in all, well done.			"

												What an amazing journey, as the original goal has come to an end.I am honestly curious about the third installment, and which routes it may take.This game builds on the first installment, and is not really a sequel, but rather the second part of the first game; where I guess the third installment could be regarded as the true sequel. In my own interpretation that is, after finishing the two first installments.The story continues and expands, and there are even some minor improvements from the first game, like directional indication in the shifting of screens and easier dialogue. Kate has gotten a slightly wider vocabulary and there are a slightly richer conversation in this one.This is absolutely a necessary game if one has played the first installment, the story are given a wider perspective, and although slightly shorter, in some regard, this is a mighty closure.Some questions may arise during the gameplay, like the brand of Kates phone (I am convinced that she owns the equivalent to a classic Nokia (3310 or 5110 for example), as probably only one of those would survive such a trip). And one has to wonder, Russia must have the best phone service on the planet, I must confess that I would not be surprised if true.#RussianhackersseeseverythingIf you are about to play this, and are not even slightly familiar with Russian culture and history, do some casual digging and study, you will enjoy this game so much more. A couple of summarizing videos on Youtube will do, as this game is rich in its references and internal/external jokes.Tooktoot/Tooktoot - Would ditch corporate America for the Motherland again and again and again...
