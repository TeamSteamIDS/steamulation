												This is a Visual Novel. That means there are no real puzzles, no real gameplay, and it is just the story. If you like point and click adventure games, a visual novel isn't a big step backwards from that sort of thing. You just don't get the puzzles that come along with the adventure genre. So when you want a totally relaxing time of just visualizing a story a graphic novel will succeed in doing that without making you have to think much about solving any puzzles. The 39 Steps is probably one of, if not the best visual novels I have ever played. It adds a lot of extra background and lore to explore within this as well that most visual novels don't contain. The 39 Steps is a classic thriller novel that has been adapted to this medium in such a way that it feels like a big time studio was behind it rather than an Indie team. This political thriller takes place in Europe, mostly in England and Scotland, You are a man that stumbles into a bit of a political conspiracy by chance, which forces you to eventually run for your life and solve the mystery before your life is ruined. The quality of the artwork is superb. The menus and user interface are clean and slick. There are no bugs, no glitches, and everything is done in a professional way. You can ""add a bookmark"" at any place in the story to the point that you can do this after every line of text presented. Making it simple to navigate back to where you were. The story is also broken up into about 20 segments so you should never find yourself lost along the way. You can have 3 profiles as well. I think it would be difficult to play this without feeling like this is how a visual novel SHOULD be done. It is as good as it gets for this genre. Adventure fans not familiar with the visual novel genre may just find that this will convince them to try more due to how well made it was. It has hand painted watercolor artwork that looks extremely realistic, and is a wonder to gaze upon. You feel like you are inside the rooms the story brings you to, the landscapes outdoors that you are stomping through, and they are so well done that you may even feel the sun shining down upon you while you are lying in a field trying to hide from your pursuers. Behind all these backdrops are well placed sound effects to give the right atmosphere. Things like horse's hooves clacking away, the coughs of patrons in a restaurant, and the footsteps of a cobblestone street. Combine that with a perfectly toned musical score to crank up the tension when it is needed, or simply set the stage for some mystery, all aspects of a well done story are in place from a technical standpoint. The game is mostly done in written text, as all visual novels are, but there are many scenes of the story that give us voice acting. The voice acting is professional. Believable for all times voices are used, accents feel genuine, and the characters all give the right inflections for the tone they are trying to convey. It is some of the best voice work I have heard in a game, and spectacular considering that it is an Indie title. Besides the voice acting, there are even a few video scenes done in that old time English cartoon way of film and presented in the silent film format. The solid black characters on solid colored backgrounds riding a horse and carriage, or an old Model-T, where you only see the whites of their eyes and teeth. Showing stories being told as they take a trip from one area to another as they are recounted to other characters. There are 3-4 of these and they are an amusing break from the reading. Between these and the voice additions you feel like you get to take some breaks from just reading quite often. Besides the presentation being top notch, The 39 Steps has an interesting view into the time period in which this novel takes places (1910's). You are able to click on scenes that give you closer looks at objects where you can read letters, look at objects more closely to give you the more intricate details of their design, and most importantly you can read several newspapers from the time period. These newspapers aren't all fictional either. The relevant articles for the story purposes are highlighted, and can be read from an easier view text form, but there are dozens of interesting historical stories and advertisements from the historical time period. You can find articles on politics, the era's fascination with the new flying “aeroplanes”, and I even spotted an article talking about the aftermath of The Titanic in which passengers had taken them to court trying to retrieve lost belongings from America. The 39 Steps offers an intriguing tale in a visual novel format. Professionally made, great design, and quite satisfying. Achievements are simple to get as they are given by following along with the story so it is an easy 100% game. I would recommend this to any adventure fan looking for a casual story experience. I believe you could finish this game in a few hours (My playtime is way off it didn't take nearly that long). Possibly around 5 hours or so if you spend any time reading the many newspaper articles that are presented for you to browse. Hopefully this group makes more classic adventure titles in this format because they have done a superb job with this one!NOTE: I had never read this novel before playing the game so I cannot tell you how much you might enjoy it if you have. I enjoyed it immensely having not read the book prior to playing the game. I can only assume it would be less enjoyable to someone that has already read the source material beforehand, as it is to me almost every time I watch a film after reading the book first. ;)			"

Original example of how a novel can be transformed into a gameThe 39 Steps is a unique interactive visual novel, developed by The Story Mechanics and first released on Steam in april 2013. The game is based on the novel with the same title by John Buchan, which got quite well-known thanks to its being the inspiration for Ian Flemmings James Bond books. The novel tels the story of Richard Hannay, a bored-to-death gentleman who all of a sudden finds himself in the eye of an espionage storm. Buchans story has its flaws: some plot-turns come across as unbelievable, but the characters are drawn very fine indeed, as is the time period against which the plot evolves.Buchans novel is followed very closely in the game, which does an excellent job in transferring the overall feel and atmosphere of the period and place during which the action takes place: London, Scotland and the English countryside early summer 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War. The developers achieved this by using a brilliantly designed and executed visual style, with a lot of hand-drawn images.Actually, the story is told in several different ways, all with their own level of interaction. The narrative part of the novel is being projected on the screen, with the player having to click through the different lines. But the game manages to introduce variety even in this simple mechanic: the tempo of the clicking varies: sometimes a screen is held onto longer, while at other times clicks has to done much faster. Dialogues are being voice-acted in a very convincing way, some self-contained stories are even being projected as short movies. There is some point-and-clicking too, although this is allways clearly indicated and not designed as a challenge or puzzle. All in all, the variety in interaction between player and game helps a lot to draw one into the story.The awesome visuals and interesting storytelling are accompanied by a soundscape that mostly stays in the background, punctuating some important actions without drawing any attention to itself. A bit more of these, and a more convincing musical envelopment would have painted the period even better I believe. But this is only a minor quibble. More problematic are the click-and-drag actions one has to perform to unlock doors or achieve other minor tasks. These feel tucked on, and do not integrate well within the overall concept.Highly recommended to anyone interested in visual novels, in literature or in artistic games in general. It's a real shame this development studio hasn't released any more games yet. "

												The 39 Steps is (as most have previously stated) an interactive novel, and NOT a game. There are some elements of interactivity in the form of mouse clicks and even ""drawing"" patterns with the mouse from time to time, but that's about it.  That said, if you know going in you're going to read and occasionally watch/listen to a story, you shouldn't be disappointed.For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the story. I would sit down and play one of the 20 or so ""chapters"" at a time. Having them broken down into 10-15 minute chunks like this helped and allowed me to play at my own pace.  The art is very well done, though there is really no actual animation. The voice acting is well done and the ambient sounds and music are a plus.Being that the story is set prior to WWI (and that I'm American and this is set in the U.K.), some of the dialects and terminology were a bit tricky to follow, but not so much that it detracted form the story itself. Other than that, my only real complaint is that the ending seems somewhat . . . abrupt. I certainly won't spoil anything, but I felt that another couple minutes of gametime could have wrapped it up a little better.All-in-all, the playthrough was an enjoyable experience and I'm looking forward to The Story Mechanic's next project.My personal rating for what it is: 7.5/10			"

												The 39 Steps leads you on a journey through lush hand-painted backgrounds, moody music, and excellent voice-acting. You are Richard Hannay, a well-to-do British gent living a boring life in London in 1914.Calling 39 Steps a game seems to be doing it a disservice, as it is more of a interactive story that just has you along for the ride.  There are points in the story where you 'control' the protoganists action, but you have no real power to affect the momentum of the narrative. The story is gripping, though, and these attempts to insert a more direct hand in the game are infrequent.I have never read the source material, so cannot say how well it holds up to the original. The 39 Steps stands well enough on its own, though. Achievement hunters interested in 100% games will find this one easy to complete, as achievements are awarded through story progression and are impossible to miss. I'd recommend not reading the achievement list before you start the story, though, as they could spoil some future events.So, if spy thrillers are your thing, grab up your pipe and your brandy and dive into this one.

												I suppose one way of dealing with the challenges of interactive storytelling is to remove any trace of interactivity. Ultimately, this game is only slightly less interactive than To The Moon, but The 39 Steps lacks To The Moon's brilliant original story and competent pacing.I had a tough time deciding whether or not I should recommend this game. I think maybe if it were under $5 and you are a patient person with 4 hours to spare, it might be worth the ride. The game does have some truly compelling moments of storytelling, but the slightly confusing and underwhelming climax undermine the otherwise fine story.The biggest problem with The 39 Steps is that it has no idea what it wants to be. It's marketed as a game, but that is one of the few things it is not; it's part graphic novel, part film and part radio play, with a ton of clicking thrown in for good measure. Some elements work, others fail miserably. I found myself consistently thinking I'd rather be reading the book on which this semi-interactive experience is based. Since that book is available for free, and can be experienced at my leisure without the uneven pacing presented here, I can't bring myself to recommend this version of The 39 Steps, despite all its ambition.

“I believe everything out of the common. The only thing to distrust is the normal.” ― John Buchan, The 39 StepsThe Thirty-Nine Steps is originally an adventure novel and an ancestor of the spy thriller genre, written by the Scottish author John Buchan in 1915 - the first year of the World War I. It has long been reinterpreted into various other media - including Alfred Hitchcock's famous 1935 silver screen interpretation. But it is the first time we see Buchan's famous action-hero, Richard Hannay in a video game, thanks to Story Mechanics' initiative with a project of reinterpreting literature as narrative video games.Here at the start of his adventures, Richard Hannay is a wealthy and able English gentleman with considerable social standing. He was raised in South Africa, became a successful mining engineer and took part in the Matabele Wars. He also served as an intelligence officer during the Boer War. He is realistic, self-sufficient with a diverse set of skills and means. Just before the events of the game, Hannay returns to London, only to find the routine life of a Londoner to be devastatingly boring. Just as he was about to give up on the capital, he is visited by one of his neighbors at his apartment in London. The neighbor reveals himself to be Franklin P. Scudder, a freelance spy and asks Hannay's help with a dangerous political plot. Finding himself in a web of lies and intrigue, Hannay quickly becomes the target of a manhunt, and starts his escape towards the Highlands of Scotland. Will he ever be able to clean his name and prevent a dangerous plot that would spell doom for all Europe?The 39 Steps is a retelling of the original novel without nearly any content cut down. The atmosphere is a wondrous success weaved out of water color environments, characters displayed as foggy silhouettes and tales that belong to characters reenacted by shadowy silent motion pictures. The display is wholly elegant and thrilling, appropriate for the tone of the narration. Voice acting is marvelous - with nuances, accents and even vocal exclamations. For the part of the presentation, you are in for a feast.As for the gameplay, on the other hand, the same cannot be said. Yes, the game is basically a visual novel but the player's participation in the narration is close to non-existent. The game could even be categorized as non-interactive considering all you actually do is some clicking to do to reveal environmental details or some mouse movements to draw certain shapes for Hannay to interact with things now and then. There is nothing you actually do, decide or participate in. You click and watch as the story unravels. On that part, one could actually prefer reading the novel rather than playing the game, but the amount of labor put into display is certainly admirable.For the last verdict, I'll bite and recommend The 39 Steps, considering newer generations prefer watching the story through a screen rather than actually reading it. You just have to know what you are getting yourselves into before buying it. The 39 Steps is not a game; it is a beautifully arranged digital story book, and one that I can safely recommend if you are unfamiliar with the novel and/or bear no intention of reading it.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												One thing that I love about video games is how they can take a story I've already heard several ways, and turn it into an entirely new experience that's just as engaging as if I was hearing it for the first time. The 39 Steps by The Story Mechanics is the first in what they call ""digital adaptations"", which fall somewhere between a visual novel and a radio show. The idea if simple, but the execution highly stylized and the pacing tightly wound to make what could have been a dry collection of text a surprisingly compelling and intense narrative piece.I shouldn't have to tell you what The 39 Steps is about (as I imagine most should be familiar with the classic novel and numerous film adaptions and spin-offs), but as a refresher it follows Scottish man Richard Hannay, recently retired and now lost in a series of humdrum days and occurrences. All of this changes when a stranger barges into his life and revels a German plot that if carried out could throw the world into a war the likes of which it had yet seen. Shortly thereafter the man, now revealed to a spy known as Scudder, is found dead in Hannay's apartment, leaving him the only one alive with the knowledge of what is soon to unfold, and the only person who could possibly prevent it.While the narrative of The 39 Steps is as intriguing and thrilling as ever, it's the way that it's told in this instance that makes it worth revisiting (or checking out for the first time) as opposed to numerous other formats you could choose. The Story Mechanics haven't settled for a simple text format in retelling Josh Buschan's tale, instead using a collection of visual tricks and clever insertion of backstory to create an brilliant interactive story that far exceeds the simplistic adaptations that have been experimented with in the past. Fantastic use of camera angles, deliberate placement of text to draw your eye toward parts of the watercolor backgrounds, and excellent voice acting from all parties make it incredibly easy to get swept away in the plot even during the slower, some may even call mundane, moments.The only real instances where The 39 Steps falls a tad flat are the awkwardly implemented gestures that sometimes accompany moments like opening doors or reading letters. They were obviously intended to make the game feel more like, well, a game, but they're shoehorned in in such a way that feels tacked on an unnecessary. Thankfully they're infrequent enough that they never amount to more than a bit of a bother nor take but a few seconds to complete.Though some might scoff at the emphasis on exposition and almost complete lack of traditional gameplay, those that can appreciate The 39 Steps for the bit of interactive fiction it is will be rewarded with an exciting and wonderfully paced tale of spies, murder, and more than a few close shaves. Having no real idea what to expect, I was very pleasantly surprised with the end result of The Story Mechanics's first attempt at a ""digital adaptation"", and it has gotten my mind spinning thinking of so many other books I'd love to see turned into future games. Hopefully this is only the first to come.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Thats how some books in modern time may be presented. I dont like the plot though. ""Its a pure Sir Henry Rider Haggard and Conan Doyle"", very childish story without meanings. All what these gentlemans do is drink whskies-and-sodas and smoke. ""I smoked in a vhsir till daylight, for i couldnt sleep"". Nice voice and language perfomances with some scottish accent.			"

												This is a great blend of a video game and an e-book. Not spoiling anything, this is a great spy thriller set right before WW1. There is limited interactivity since you are usually just clicking on various locations, finding helpful items and clues, and piecing together the mystery. The artwork is fantastic. So many times I wished I could be sucked into the game just to enjoy being in the world of England 1914. While the backgrounds are stunning, the characters are given a silhouette, letting the player draw their own conclusions to their distinct features. I love the cut scenes. They are done in a silent film style, which again draws from the time period. The cast of voice actors is spot on perfect. Now whether or not this game is worth the full retail pricetag is debatable. I bought this game for 1.49 and it was well worth it. Knowing what I know now, I would have paid full price. However, I love story above all in video games. For those who are bothered with the limited interactivity, wait for a sale. I cannot wait to see what The Story Mechanics will do next! This is an indie developer I will keep my eyes on.			"

												""The 39 Steps"" is, down to its core, a slightly-interactive-novel. That being said - it's not ""bad"" by any means. For what it is, it's incredibly well done, and a means in which I would love to continue consume various forms of classical fiction.Based on the original espionage thriller ""The 39 Steps"" by John Buchan, you can definitely see where modern day spy stories came from - predating popular fictional characters like James Bond by at least 30 years. This story takes place on the verge of WWI and introduces a character named Richard Hanny, a man on the run after a young American spy divulges sensitive information to him. The game is presented mostly in beautifully painted backdrops, fuzzy silhouettes and the occasional shadow puppet show (of which are quite entertaining). These backgrounds take you from inner-city London, to the moors of Scotland and back again. There isn't much gameplay to be had (to my slight disappointment), but what is present is likened to that of a game like ""TRAUMA"" - drawing shapes and clicking on things to carry through the cutscene-like chapters.Simply put - the game is awesome for what it is - but it really needs a bit more interactivity. There is one part that involves the character decoding a notebook. I got really excited, thinking that I'd at least have a mini-game or a puzzle to figure out the code, but alas - the game just carries on like the book. They allow you to zoom in and out on objects you see in the environments - here I am, thinking that I'll have to do some Sherlock Holmes work and pick out clues from the zoomed-in objects, but alas - there isn't much to discover but a few timeline-appropriate advertisements and newspaper articles.I would love to digest all sorts of fiction this way. From Sherlock Holmes to H.P. Lovecraft to Franz Kafka - I would love to have this sort of artwork and voice acting and sound effects, mood, pacing, attention to detail, and the ease of taking it in via separate chapters (just incase I need to leave and come back to it) - albeit, more interactivity would be preferred.

												Perhaps a visual novel is not my cup of tea as I find The 39 Steps rather boring.  I'm a bookworm but I disliked how I can't bookmark the game progress at will, so have to re-watch cutscenes that can't be skipped. To avoid that, I finished one chapter at a time, often falling asleep or wishing I was playing other games in the process.On a positive note, the art is gorgeous and the voice acting is good. The gameplay itself was quite dull though.			"

												This is an interactive novel by John Buchan. I would describe it as a mixture of reading a book and listening to a number of conversations. There is NOT much gameplay envolved, except clicking a few items here and there, and to draw some patterns. The story is about Richard Hannay and his escape from London. Many things happens along the way, and this is where the story shines. Its a little bit hard to understand what some scottish and english people are saying due to dialects and use of old words.If you enjoy reading books and you want a good story, without gameplay getting in your way, this is a great game. If you like other ""non-games"" like Dear Easter, Proteus or Gone Home this might be the right experience for you as well.Many others will however HATE this, because they will not see it as a game. Other people in my age will also dislike this game because they thing reading is boring, and games without gameplay is a waste of time. I really liked this visual novel and its story, and the art is absolutely fantastic. The voice acting is top-notch and also the music.  The developers obviously put a lot of time and efford into this project and therefore it earns my recommendation.			"

												Alright, just played through The 39 Steps today. Took about 4 hours all told to complete, although there was probably an hour of idle time mixed in there. Anyway, I thought it was pretty stellar. A digital adaptation of a book. They say it was the inspiration for Ian Fleming style of writing, I think it bore a lot of similarities to Hitchcock's North by Northwest (and it turns out Hitchcock did in fact do a film adaptation of 39 Steps earlier in his career) as well. A very good and interesting story set in the early 1900's. Although there aren't branching paths, I thought the game till did an excellent job of immersing you into the story completely. Sort of non traditional from a point and click perspective due to a little twist in manipulating some object. The artwork was very nice, mostly done in watercolors and more traditional painting styles as well, with some silent film style cutscenes mixed in. Definitely recommend playing this one.			"

												The 39 Steps is a digital adaption of a John Buchan's espionage thriller.And since I don't want to spoil the story for anyone still waiting to enjoy it, I won't reveal any story details.But I will say this, the story is brilliant and has a lot of twists and turns and will keep you hooked till the end. At least that's how I've felt. The art in the game is absolutely gorgeous and the sound design is spot on as well. This is like reading a book, but you interact ingame with a mouse at certain situations and click objects on screen such as newspapers or items of interest. There are also times where you have to imitate real movements with a mouse ( sort of like in Fahrenheit / Indigo Prophecy if you have played that game).There are also cards to collect and awards to unlock while playing the game, which is a nice touch for all those people like myself who enjoy collecting things.All in all:+ Great story+ Beautiful art design+ Good sound effects and acting- If you dont like reading a lot, this game is not for youIf you are looking for a great thriller story accompanied by great art design and acting, you are going to enjoy this game. 9 / 10			"

""Reveal the WW1 conspiracy in an exciting adventure""The 39 Steps is an interactive crime story adapted from a book.So you might be not challenged clicking through a text adventure, but otherwise everything is well made. The graphics are painted nearby realistic landscapes uncommon to other comic adventures. There are several historical pictures included. The story takes place in 1914, a few weeks before WW1 breaks out. You are searching for a conspirancy that leads to the upcoming events.There are rarely search screens during the whole story, but sometimes also a nice gesture function is used. Mostly it's very atmospheric. Only the characters are shown as outlined ghosts. I liked the most when somebody was telling yarn. Then an artistical silhouette movie appeared. The language voices of the characters differs from British English, German, Scottish accent to French accent.In the end it was getting hard to unlock all awards for the last achievement.

												The Thirthy-Nine Steps is one of the earliest and arguably most influential novel in the history of espionage thriller. The book by John Buchan, published in 1915, is now public domain which means the devs could get away with anything in this digital adaption. But what surprised me is they were extremely loyal to the plot. This digital adaption is even told in 1st person like the original work. They did not offer any changes, which can be termed as lazy. But a novel that doesn't need change shouldn't be changed anyway. Voice acting is good. Story-telling is done right. The only thing that bugged me is the lack of character ""appearance"" in the artwork. But that's not a big deal. Anyway, this is a good digital adaption of the novel and I highly recommend it.Warning - Do not buy if you're looking for a game. This is NOT a game, not even a point and click game. This is basically a audio novel with some relevant artwork.			"

The 39 Steps is an animated, illustrated espionage-novel with sounds, music and linear narration - and without any real choices for the ""player"" during the whole story. So don't expect a full pc game, but instead anticipate a classic digital novel adaption, which totally knows how to entertain the audience. You'll find yourself in an authentic England of 1914 and you'll be able to enjoy wonderfully painted illustrations. All actions one is able to do are: examining various objects, clicking at things, or moving the cursor from time to time into specified directions to simulate actions, like for example running away, shaving, building explosive devices, opening doors, etc. And it works - and raises the level of immersion during the narration. It looks great, the atmosphere feels great and the narration has a fluent feeling to it. Plus it's easy to get the 100%-achievements just along the way. Altogether its an exciting, enthralling Spy Fiction Story with a lot of moments of suspense! Couldn't have asked for more. I recommend it for relaxed autumn evenings, when reading is just the perfect thing to do.			"

												This is not an adventure, it's not even a game. It is interactive fiction, but don't think that you have actual influence on the story. That said I'm not complaining about the fact that it isn't a game, since it tells a quite interesting story in an interesting way. The pacing might feel odd here and there, the gesture 'minigames' are misplaced and the visuals while being nice to look at are nothing special. Still I enjoyed the novel presented this way. The story goes a bit here and there, but in the end gets to a closure.I won't recommend this 'game' if you are looking to play an adventure (like I did), but if you enjoy novels presented in a slightly interactive way with a good amount of decent voice acting, this one might be for you.P.S.: 10$ might be a bit much for the ride though.

✓ Excellent story and narration.✓ Excellent voice acting (even though I'm not a native English speaker, I had a couple of good laughs listening to some Scottish side-character).✓ Very well curated artworks and visual effects (transitions and animations).✓ Very particular playing style, common to Visual Novels but original nonetheless.

✘ A couple of times subtitles were missing.✘ Sometimes I had difficulties understanding words and phrases too: I know, this is my fault, not the game's one but it can be a good enough topic for non-English people to think about before buying.Would you like to read a book while listening to characters voices, ambient sounds and background music? Would it be even better if you were able to watch it like a movie and enjoy like you were its protagonist?If the answer to those questions is ""yes"", than you'll understand why ""The 39 Steps"" is a must to play game.

												Come, sit with me by the fire a moment, you smart, youthful, effervescent, irresistably attractive gamer you. I'd like to have a chat with you about modern life, if I may. There's a really good point to all this, I promise.There's way too much content out there right now. And no matter what it is you're in to, you'll never be able to get through everything you want. Whether you're a TV show enthusiast or a movie lover, you're high on sound or big on gaming, an avid fan of all the latest comic books or works of highbrow literature, or just a dedicated follower of the art scene or certain, ummm... specialist videos found throughout the internet, whatever's your bag, there's more going on than any mere mortal would ever be able to keep up with. And that's even if you're only into one of these things. If you're into a few then, well... yeah, you're basically boned.There's more content to consume now than ever before, and that statement will only ever continue to be more and more true as time goes on. There used to be a time when content creation was something reserved for the elites, for people with access to the proper equipment and money needed to produce something then distribute it to the masses, and we pretty much had to be content with whatever scraps we were given. But now, the doors have been blown wide open for just about everyone. No longer do you need a big expensive studio to make music or record film. Even amazing games can be created in a bedroom then reach a global audience more easily than ever. All you need is a microphone or a camera and a computer with internet access and you already have the basics to get started for so many things. I don't know about you, but I think that's pretty bloody mind-blowing.The great thing about that? We're now spoiled for choice for how we want to pass the time and entertain ourselves. The bad thing? We now have to be incredibly fussy about what we consume and time now becomes one of our most valuable commodities as we have less of it to decide whether something is worth sticking with or if we want to move on to the next thing. And that's before even in factoring real life into the equation. We might have family or relationship stuff to deal with, or work or education matters to attend to. There's a lot going on for everyone. The result is that we now have to decide pretty damn quickly if we want to spend time on something. If it doesn't grab us immediately, then there's a million and one other things all screaming for our attention. Personally, I've never read a comic book in my life because the sheer volume of history there has essentially made that medium impenetrable for me at this stage. I used to play music but those days are far behind me now. Even TV and movies are fast dwindling in my life. I've made my bed with videogames, and now I'm lying in it. So, ""Just what in the name of Jiminy Christmas does this have to do with The 39 Steps?"", I hear you ask. Well, I don't read books either. But his made me realise gaming is the perfect gateway into so many other things.More visual novel than game, The 39 Steps is based on the book of the same name, a tale about a prospector and war veteran who leaves his African adventuring behind in the early 1900s and returns to his original home of England for the quiet life, only to soon find himself embroiled in an international conspiracy set to plunge nations into war with each other. What unfolds is a spy thriller as the hero, Richard Hannay, must avoid the clutches of the conspirators whilst also trying to gather proof to expose them and clear his name of a crime they have set him up as the perpetrator of. And so he goes, on a merry chase across the highlands of Scotland, meeting a colourful cast of characters along the way, as he tries to outwit his pursuers and do his best to stay one move ahead along the way.The presentation is beautiful, as an array of backgrounds are presented to us throughout every scene, and ambient audio sets the mood for us, along with the occasional splattering of music and voice acting. The art style can vary depending on the scene, cleverly introducing us to the tone of a particular character or scenario, before then returning to the more traditional, realistic, painted look for the rest of the story. There are occasional moments of interaction beyond clicking a button to read the next piece of text, such as examining the setting in a room or flipping through newspapers or assembling items that progress the story, but for the most part it's a pretty passive affair as you'll largely be reading your way from one part to the next.While it wasn't perfect, and some parts of the story felt like they were either meandering or getting repetitive in parts (I swear some of it felt like it was just an advertisement from the Scottish Tourism Board, dwelling on how stunning the scenery was or basking in the charm and generosity of the locals) overall I really enjoyed reading this - and that's what I found so amazing about it. Were this simply some pages and ink, or some text on a screen, I don't think I would have been nearly as involved as I was. But add some nice art and production values to it, gamify it a little and throw in some achievements for me to get, and I'll play the hell out of it. It made me realise this could be the way to get gamers into so many other things, a Trojan horse of sorts to expose us to more great literature or art or to be used as a tool for learning.There's so much that could be done to exploit the medium of gaming to branch it out and reach wider audiences than so many things might by themselves. I mean, of the people who played/read this, how many would have actually sat down with the novel of their own volition otherwise? Provided it was based on the right source material, and handled with as much reverence and style as it with this, then they really could be onto something here. So, while this shines as a great example and starting point for what could be done with other pieces of media outside gaming, it's also a really great experience in its own right. I'm really glad I took the chance on it (and hope lots of others do, too) and look forward even more to seeing what else I'll be introduced to in future.			"

												Disclaimer/TLDR: The game is a Visual Novel based on a novel from 1915, featuring harder-than-everyday's English, strong Scottish accent, and is about as interesting as it would be to read the book - keep these things in mind when purchasing. The story itself is really nice, but it's not presented in a way that it's easy to digest.39 Steps is one of the worst good-games I played. The story is great, but because how the story, the era, the book is, the story is not the most pleasant to be experienced as a game. The story rather features classes, than real personalities, and focuses on the present - not even a hint what will happen, barely any reflection to the past than remembering the chasers makes the game enjoyable only if you're actively progressing in it - either the story lost parts when it got implemented as a game, or it's not exactly a type of story that works greatly as a game.The language is a potential problem for a lot of non-native English speakers: the game features a really heavy load of English expressions, as the book of origin is from 1915, featuring well... a lot of fancy-talk between gentlemen and quite some part with really, really strong scottish accent. If anyone has trouble understanding a today's series without subtitles, I'm almost sure that they'll have problem with understanding this game.The story of the game is interesting, the controls are easy (Click to progress, and mouse-gestures in some scenes) and the voice acting is phenomenal - but with all of this,  I think the story's pacing is off, the text can't really be urged to progress, and it's just slow. There is 19 chapters, and each chapter's title is on screen for 5+ seconds, then the location and date is on screen for 15+ seconds. The game has a lot of audio cues about what's currently happening - sounds of the city, a mass of people, car being cranked up and such, all with outstanding quality, but the majority of the game has no notable background music, or not at all. This turns the game somewhat tedious, as the story is action and progress-oriented. Just as a comparison: a good visual novel has good characters, interaction between them, and an interaction with the setting. In this story the protagonist is fleeing, and he's just states what's happening, whom he is meeting instead of reflecting to them. This is a storytelling VN-like story that focuses of what's happening currently and there are barely any reoccuring characters, and most of them have only a role, a rank, a class instead of a personality.  So in short: there is something happening, but there's barely anything to think about in the game, BUT the thing that's happening. And for me, this is the reason the game took me 3 + 11 hours to finish, while it's around 4h long. It's a really interesting piece, but the presentation's way and VN interpretation makes the game harder to be enjoyed, than the book would be.			"

												This game is not for everyone as it is little more than an interactive story, but even if you don't normally like interactive stories, if you enjoy a good plot you might want to check this out.This is not normally my genre of game, but the plot sounded interesting so I thought I'd check it out. I later read the book and I have to say, this game is very true to the story, and it presents it in a fun and interesting way as point and click minigames.As for the story itself, if you don't play this game, at least read the story (if you like books). The author did a very good job at putting together a captivating espionage thriller (not my normal book genre either) about a man that ends up on the run from some dangerous people because he helped a stranger.The main character is very resourceful and has quite the interesting adventure being on the run, and is not too long into the story accused of murder and on the run from the police as well.I wouldn't likely play this game again unless I wanted to recount that adventure, but I could also read the book if I wanted to do that. Replayability is limited, but I still highly recommend this game. John Buchan wrote a great story and the devs made a very stable app with an easy to use interface to present it.			"

												The 39 Steps is a famous adventure thriller novel by John Buchan that released in 1915. This novel had several movie adaptation, and the first movie adaptation directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1935. And this game is a digital adaptation of John Buchan's novel, it is different to compared to another Visual Novel games. This game is not like that.I like The Story Mechanics  treatment about this game, they presentation of this game made me feel that I watch a thriller movie than playing a game. The storytelling is masterpiece. The soundtrack is very good, it blend with the atmosphere of the scene and sometimes made me nervous about the next scene. The voice acting is superb, especially english gaelic accent of the scotslands peoples.Well, this digital adaptation is an alternative way to read a famous literature, I'll hope The Story Mechanics made another adaptation of famous literature by famous writer. And I'm highly recommended this game to anyone interested in good storytelling games.			"

A good story, well told.This is a very nicely done adaptation of John Buchan's novel. It kept me wanting more the whole way through, in much the same way any good book will. The voice work and music are both excellent and the pacing and interactive elements completely fit the style of the game. The visuals are also very good, especially the fantastic animated scenes. The game is not without a couple of slightly rough edges, though. The audio can cut out noticeably abruptly at times and the quality of the background art is occasionally lacking a little, but neither take away from a very entertaining few hours.			"

												The 39 Steps is a virtual novel with very little interaction. It is 100% impossible to get stuck on this game, because you've got to left click through text or objects (with a big diamond-shaped icon right in the middle of every objects), or simply do a series of left, down, up, right, clockwise or counter-clockwise mouse movements for every single puzzles in the game.The only part of this game I liked, are the voice acting and graphics, especially the graphics, they are truly amazing! Though, the important aspect of a virtual novel is the story and in the case of ""The 39 Steps"" I didin't understand much of the story, it kinda ruined it for me. Now i've got to say, my first language isn't english, but I really couldn't understand the beginning of the story. I also couldn't understand any british dialogues, because they were all slang. Some parts were also in German, with no translation what-so-ever.Another complaint about this game, is how the game is saved. The ''chapters'' takes about 15 minutes each, but if you want to alt-tab (probably a bug) or quit the game, you might have or might not have to restart that chapter all over again. This made me replay at least 3 chapters (which, by the way, you cannot skip any text or cutscenes) and effectively made me watch all of the dialogues and cutscenes again.I am quite disapointed with this ""game"" so I cannot recommend it. If you were going to purchase this virtual novel, I really hope you understand english very well and don't mind not being able to have any influence in the story nor have any puzzles to solve at all while playing this.

												The 39 Steps is a beautiful take on a visual novel. And yes, it is a visual novel, if you had any doubts about it, let go of them now. Visual novel, full time.First, let me hit the up sides, just to get them out of the way. The graphics are gorgeous. Paintings of London, and Scottish landscapes, mountains, tiny villages, all of them absolutely stunning, screenshot worthy to say the least. Once in a while, when one of the characters tells a story, you get a cutscene animated in the cutest, old time cartoon style. Those were really enjoyable, and slightly funny.Music is delicate, simple and very suitable for the story. Exactly the sort of music you would expect to play in an espionage thriller. I am kind of torn on the voice acting. On one hand, can't deny it's pretty much perfect, professional on all aspects. On the other hand... it's theater style acting. Which I'm not a fan of in games. It's over the top, exclaiming shocking findings in a fake, obvious tone and such. I feel theater style voice acting should stay in the theater.But now... The down sides.The mechanism for progressing the text is definitely original, if somewhat redundant, and in a while gets really annoying. The necessity of doing little circles with your mouse to progress the game quickly gets boring, and before you know it, you start clicking away, trying to hurry it the hell up. Game also bugged out on me a couple of times in pause menu, forcing me to replay whole chapters, clicking even more furiously, as I've already read all this stuff.But the real pain is... the story. Perhaps the book originally is way better, more detailed, shows more depth and simple logic. But what we see in the game is an extremely far fetched story, where everyone believes everyone for no apparent reason, where people entrust the biggest, life threatening secrets to strangers they barely met, where all a person needs to do, is change their attitude, to suddenly become unrecognisable...The amount of ridiculousness, lack of logic and pure stupidity of the story, and its main character, were more than I could bear. After a short while I couldn't enjoy the witty cutscenes, gentle music, or lovely landscapes. I just wanted to be over with it, finish this thing... If only the graphics, cutscenes, music, and even voice acting were used with a different story, it might have been truly impressive. Perhaps the story requires too much detail to be squeezed into a visual novel, but it didn't work with it, and wasted good resources on something, that ended up being a real pain to get through.			"

Product received for free
Interactive visual novel with breathtaking artNot really a game but rather a ""digital adaptation"" (as the developers put it) of a novel. It's narrated by the protagonist, whose shoes you step into when you play. There are no choices to be made; only simple mouse gestures (e.g. clockwise movement to unlock doors, left-right movement to run, etc) which are non-time sensitive, and some clicking on objects in certain scenes to examine them more closely. The story is split into numerous chapters, and you progress linearly through them. Any completed chapter may be replayed at any point of time.Pros- Intriguing story about a man involved in a WWI conspiracy- Gorgeous artwork:

- Highly immersive (mainly due to the beautiful art & excellent audio)- Convincingly voiced- Nicely presented- Historical setting is effectively conveyed- Good mix of various media (text, voice, illustration, photos)- The story takes you through a variety of different landscapes, from urban to rural to coastalCons- Clicking to backtrack text requires an anti-clockwise mouse rotation. Why not just right-click or some simpler action, ffs?- Cannot fast-forward voiced parts, therefore painfully slow at points- Game intro very tedious to sit through (please, let's just start already, ok?)- Language subpar on occasion (e.g. bad spelling, grammar, etc)ConclusionA pretty good VN to accompany a meal or snack, since you don't have to do much except sit back, relax, and click to progress through the story. The mouse gestures and game system take a while at first to settle into, but once you know what's expected of you, getting through the game is a fairly smooth and fuss-free process. The sound and music are immaculate. A large part of the story takes place in - and therefore features - the Scottish countryside and its folk. If this is something you enjoy or would like to experience, then I highly recommend this title. Total playtime: ~3 hours			"

												Edit: I had to cut down my review a bit because it seems Steam is experiencing a bug.As someone who hadn't previously read the book or seen the play/movie, I have to say this definitely made me want to read/watch. It started off pretty slow, (again I'm sure someone will pick up this game having no prior knowledge of this story) I had a problem where whenever I would alternate to a different window to do something, even when pausing the game, it would not let me continue, instead it would restart the chapter I was currently on, which can get annoying as I'm a very easily distracted person. Nonetheless, solving that would just mean putting your undivided attention into the game, at least until the end of that chapter (which is a good thing as this is more of an interactive story rather than a game, you wouldn't want to miss precious plot)Anyway, the water colour landscape art is absolutely stunning, and added suspense in a way that really made you listen to what was being said and at times forced you to visualize the situation yourself, with the help of some awesome first person narration. I bought this game a while back on a third person game bundle site for a few bucks at most. Would I spend $15 on this game? No. But I am broke so I'm speaking from the stance of an empty walleted person.All in all this game is relaxing, suspenseful, and to a degree educational. I'd recommend this game to those who want something that they can casually unwind to, without much effort on their part.			"

												Though somewhat primitive, The 39 Steps is an ok alternative to just reading a book. While more gameplay features would be nice, it tells the story just fine and does attempt to keep the reader engaged.That being said, it certainly can drag on in certain areas. Sometimes the music and visuals are just not enough to brighten up a passage.It's not the must play game of the year, but if you are mildly interested in Buchan's The 39 Steps but don't want to read it dry, this might help a bit.

												The most important thing is that this is a ""visual novel"", not your typical game or graphic adventure.Once you realize that, it's a very good adaptation. If you have not read the book, here you have the chance to do so, with sometimes more information about the historical context, etc. The level of interaction is minimal, you just click to make the text go on, open doors and some actions, but it is enough because the main objective is that you read the novel.As a visual novel, recommended.

												Ever wondered what it would feel like if you read a novel with accompanying artwork, plus, each conversation was acted out by voice actors? This is what ""The 39 Steps"" feels like - the so-called ""digital adaptation"" of a Scottish novel by the same name. The ""game"" shows us texts telling us the story of Richard Hannay. One picture follows another one; when watching these we hear the corresponding sound effects: horse carriages moving in front of Richard's house or the sound of a stream just under the bridge where he's having a conversation with a stranger. This is an interesting genre - I do not know what to make of it but 39 Steps was a good example to give it a try for the first time.The plot revolves around an expatriate who returns to London and meets a strange fellow who starts babbling about a plan to assassinate the prime minister of Greece. Apparently, getting rid of this person can result in such a chaos that may bring World War I forward (historically, we are just before when the actual war broke out, in the spring of 1914). Richard takes in Scudder who is later found dead in his room. This comes as a surprise as Scudder explained it to Richard in detail how he actually arranged his death a while ago so that nobody would come looking for him (since he already knew too much of this plan to create anarchy).So, Richard is on the run and while doing so he meets quite some people and uses a couple of aliases in order to hide. As mentioned, you essentially read texts to follow his story - these do not appear all at once but as you move your mouse clockwise you receive your next batch of sentences on the screen. As you complete certain sections (the game calls these events) you earn achievements; this is an easy way to get 100% since you just need to complete the game. Occasionally, Richard finds himself in a room that he can investigate. This simply means that some objects are highlighted and once clicking on them the corresponding (explanatory) text appears. Diamond symbols in the lower-right or -left corner of the screen indicate how many items we can find and interact with. I do not know if they are a must for the achievement but since you rarely get more than 3 or 4 it is really easy to find everything.If I remember correctly there are 19 chapters altogether and bookmarking any section within a chapter is possible so that you can pick up right where you left it off. There's some great voice acting done here and also I liked the accompanying music. The story was also interesting - mainly because I was eager to find out what exactly the 39 steps meant. Like I said this is an interesting genre to pick - some might say it's best to just pick up a book and read it. Since I like the concept and the execution (casual gameplay and simplistic, but great looking menus and beautiful artwork) I give this one a thumbs-up. Unfortunately, upon checking if there were more from this developer I did not find any but this novel was already released 4 years ago.			"

												Let's get this out of the way first: This is an interactive story. Not a video game in the traditional sense, as there are no possible 'Fail' states.With that said, this is a fantastic retelling of John Buchan's epic novel 'The 39 Steps'. A beautifully-rendered feature, with some good voice acting. You effectively play your way through fictitious events leading up to the Great War. You follow the story of Richard Hanny - who has led a very interesting life, but finds himself in London, bored, with little to do, despite sitting on a pile of money.Then, events transpire, a murder is committed, and Hannay is framed. Puzzling out the clues left behind by the unfortunate victim, Hanny retraces the poor fellow's steps, and vows to complete what the man alas could not.What follows is an adventure to rural Scotland, a story of a man on the run, from the law, and from the mysteious 'Black Stone' - an organisation out to stop Hannay by any means necessary!A really great story, and one that encouraged me to read the book. That - in my opinion - is enough for me to hit that 'Positive' button.This game isn't for everybody, as it is a slow-burn, with no critical elements to deal with. But if you're fond of interactive novels, this is a must-have.As it happens, I recorded my playthrough - so do please feel free to have a look for yourself before deciding!

												Hard to believe this well-written story is almost 100 years old :o+Better story than [insert generic vampire/zombie novel here]+Amazing backdrops!+Great voice acting (although I could not understand half of it even with subtitles ><)+Chapter-based ""play"" makes progress manageable (easy to pick up where you left off)o Maybe the story could be a little more interactive? (eg. walking around, having animations, actually decoding the notebook)- After the intense build-up the conclusion seems a little abrupt- Lack of actual gameplay may turn some people offDISCLAIMER: I have not read the actual novel10/10 Looking forward to the next adaptation by The Story Machanics			"

												As a point & click adaptation, it loses something of the pacing, intensity, and imaginative power of Buchan’s rollercoaster, only really picking up towards the very end despite a 4 to 5 hour running time. Again, against more traditional video game experiences – even the likes of Dear Esther – it struggles to satisfy when players actions have comparatively little effect.But it still contains many memorable encounters and if The 39 Steps can convince players to check out the original story (free from Project Gutenberg[www.gutenberg.org]), or others like it, then perhaps this experimental foray has done its job well enough.

												The 39 Steps is a visual novel game based on the 1915 novel by John Buchan. You are Richard Hannay who has been framed for murder and are now on the run. You are being chased by a group called the Black Stone because you know their secret. It’s your job to expose them.I thought the story was decent and somewhat thrilling but I would tend to fall asleep playing the game. There isn’t much interaction except for periodically clicking the mouse button and some small gestures once in a while. Most of the time you are reading words placed over some nicely drawn scenery with some small spoken dialog sections which is well done. You could probably finish the game in one sitting if you are able to stay awake the whole time. I’ve played a few other VN games so I know they aren’t like your typical game, but this one was just not exciting or very interesting. There are some cards and awards to collect but those are pretty much standard unlocks by playing the game. Nothing special to them at all.I can’t really recommend this game unless you are a diehard VN person or really, really love espionage stories.Bear Rating: 5/10 "

												Got this in a Humble Bundle for less than a dollar, and although I haven't finished it yet I can say that even if you are into weird random artsy interactive story things, wait for a similarly steep sale before you consider picking it up. It's a point-and-click, and a very modest one at that; most of it is reading, although it's balanced by good pacing of introducing new visual and interactive elements. I happen to like the plot because it reminds me of Agatha Christie's Poirot stories, but you may find it a little cliche if you regularly read/watch/consume mysteries and political thrillers.			"

												jeez louise this is a racing romp. move over bond we got hannay in the house and he's going to teach us what espionage really means. ya see, the thirty-nine steps was written in 1915. I ain't read the original but now I'm curious to do so, someday, maybe. it's possible you're familar with hitchcock's film adaption - I am not - but with this in mind we got a real vidya gamin period piece. it even has guns and violence so it's a perfect period piece for the medium. HA!cough, so yeah it's an adaption of something constantly adapted. there ain't much here to dissect besides the story and literary analysis ain't really my thing unless I'm impressed. so let's just go with a classic: the game is fun. awww yea boy you know what that means. it's a regular good game that's what. what we got, what we got, we got some painted scenery. gog DANG have you seen the artwork. it's bleeding brilliant, it spills all over the screen. the attention to detail is always impeccable. and that doesn't just sit with the art! the writing is mindful of the time while adeptly conveying background without awkwardly hamfisting the narration. the segways and different menus that pop in and out while you're playing to convey different information is delightful. also those newspapers, the freaking perfectly accurate newspapers. man I could write paragraphs on those newspapersthe newspapers are not only written in the language of the time but they always include timely articles and adveryeah just kidding about writing paragraphs on the newspapers. but they're representational of the game's quality if anything. the game also delivers in sound. we got your moody soundtrack, we got your professional sound effects, and seriously the voice acting is amazing. hannay just popped, ""DEAR GOD"" to quote my favorite line. what, that's not really a line? gameplay involves moving forward to the next page and then reading it. le hurrdurr not a game, but wait! you get to click and interact with things! the silliest moments in the game are like OPEN THIS DOORKNOB BY DRAWING ARROWS and SERVE DRINKS BY DRAWING ARROWS basically you get to do things by drawing arrows. sometimes you get to investigate things too, but it's all so clearly marked the discovery part is soiled. they didn't want you to miss any of their precious story which is just as wellso the story? well, it rips. it ain't nothin more than a blockbuster (granted one that's nearly a hundred years old), but I'm still turning the final sequence around in my head. hannay is a proper action hero in all meanings of that phrase. if you like reading with your vidya, are interested in new and exciting directions for the medium, or are just in the mood for some good 'ole storytelling, I say play this game. it ain't a heartsopper but man is it exciting.

												This game is pretty good. Visual novel really did a good job to portray Richard Hannay's character in this game. Expect nail biting scenes as the main character tries to escape from a crime he didn't commit. Witness the escalating tension between French and German as he discovered the truth that must be silenced immediately while Richard Hannay tries to outwit his pursuers in an adventure packed game.The art style is kinda good (mostly at the beautiful landscapes). The voice acting was pretty normal. A video rarely comes but that is certainly acceptable because what's important is the immersion to the story wherein the subtitles and acting did a good job.			"

												The team behind this have done a really good job.  The artwork is fantastic, The sound effects and musical score is great, and the voice acting is spot on for the era the book is set in.  They have tried to make an 'interactive' digital book, of course your interactions cannot change the outcome as  they are purely re-telling an abridged version of the book.I like what they are trying to do here, however I did find the mouse gestures pretty much pointless and a waste of time.  I did like the moments of exploring the immediate vicinity for extra information but again not wholly necessary and they were few and far between.As much as I liked this I do wonder how much I would of enjoyed if I knew nothing about the book.  Taking a step back this is a very shortened version of the story and I feel the some of the gaps could make it uneasy to follow without prior knowledge.I am still not fully convinced this is a great way to get to know a book. Clearly,  actually getting the intended story and reading is far better but I would like to try this with a book I have no knowledge of and see how it plays out.However, I do recommend this to people who like The 39 Steps and to people who are open minded to trying new things.

Short version: 67%Cross-media experiments are always risky, and this unique adaptation of ‘The 39 Steps’ is a good example to show it. There was a lot of thought and care put into it, but in the end it just didn't succeed. It’s a shame, really.Long version:If you didn’t know already, ‘The 39 Steps’ was originally a serialised pulp novel published in 1915. Its protagonist, an involuntary adventurer, Hannay, gets caught in a web of German conspiracy against the power structures of Europe, only to be chased through half of Scotland, eluding his pursuers only by his quick wits and a few friendly locals. It was sort of a forefather of the spy thriller genre that was so popular in the 1970s.This adaptation tried to do something other than the numerous others by being a cross between a visual novel and an audiobook. Sadly, it fell between the two stools.For a radio drama, it is good, and the actors are especially adept at portraying all the various British dialects, but there are so few recorded sections that you sometimes forget that these characters have voices.For a visual novel, it is just dull. Everything is a still image background with an occasional grey silhouette. The drawings look spectacular, but their stillness completely fails to capture the supposedly fast pace of this century-old action thriller.I wish I could give a better rating, because the amount of work put into this adaptation is more than admirable. But in the end, I must say that if you are interested in ‘The 39 Steps’, just buy the book instead.			"

												The 39 Steps is a video-game (a term I use very lightly here) based on the novel by Scottish author John Buchan concerning the intrigue and sinister goings-on just before the start of World War I.  It is more digital adaptation than video-game, playing very much like a click-lite adventure on rails.  That is there are no puzzles and no decision-trees to take you on potentially different paths.  The objective is singluar, to experience all chapters of the story in order to discover the significance of The 39 Steps.  You take on the role of the protaganist; Richard Hannay who must journey across England and Scotland in order to uncover the significance of The 39 Steps, by uncovering a sinister plot against the leader of another country, while on the run from the law and chased by agents of an unknown group hell-bent on stopping him.What you can expect to experience is a excellent story told and visualized in a great way using a number of graphical vehicles such as canvas paintings, old projector style moving pictures, newspapers, letters and maps, all crafted by passionate hands.  While I would in no way call it a Triple-A title; art, voice-acting, music and sounds all add to a generally foreboding atmosphere, while encouraging you to continue through each scene.  The voice-acting in particular is wonderfully done, reeling you in to what is a well paced thriller with sporadically placed scenes of action.The 'game' works as a whole because it transforms the words and pages of the book into visually evocative scenes capturing the essence of the narration.  Really the only interaction is two-fold: a number scenes where the player must examine items to gain more insight into the story and, a few places where the player must draw using the mouse to emulating performing a task.  As you play you gain access to cards which outline important subjects from the book which can be examined whenever you wish.  Being a fan of the original book and a number of movie adaptations the purchase of The 39 Steps on Steam was a no-brainer.  For someone who doesnt like to read or listen to a story being told and would rather play a video game in the traditional sense, I would urge them to go play something more action-oriented.A very enjoyable adaptation of a great story.

												Sitting down and reading a good book, immersing one self in the story, is a great feeling.  But what if you could experience a book.This is what The Story Mechanics has achieved with The 39 Steps.They've taken a good book, and turned it into a great experience.  From the beginning straight through to the end the player is grabbed by the collar and pulled into the world and lot of Richard Hannay.  The 39 Steps is recommended to anybody who likes adventure games, but also loves a good story.  The latter being important as there is not much in terms of 'gameplay' in this experience, rather the player is providing a helping hand in forwarding the story at their own pace.An excellent example of how a book can be turned into an interactive experience.  An experience that should not be missed.			"

8.5/10This is quite unexpected. I didn't know anything about this game until not even halfway through. I thought the gameplay was boring and the interactions felt forced and plain. That was until I realized it was actually just a digital adaptation of an infamous novel (shame on me).Gameplay was just about clicking your way through like any other visual novel, no branching of course. The text transitiions was pretty delightful and varied. There was also some  quick time events-like moments, only without time limit (maybe for the sake of variation).Soundtracks were pretty satisfying, at times enhancing the atmosphere especially the thrill of the last chapter. Still can't get the main OST out of my head though :pArts were very pleasant, if not beautiful. What was exceptional was the maker's attention to details. When you inspect a newspaper's page for just one or two canon article, you can see that every single obligatory article stands on its own context. If only I had time to read them all.All in all, it was a quite an amazing ride. Not an expert myself, I'll say it was a well made literature digital adoption. ---			"

												No gameplay, no puzzles or mysteries to solve. No decisions to make. Don't get me wrong I love reading and I read a lot of books but the story was kind of uninteresting and there weren't any exciting events or real conflicts for the main character to overcome. Everything happened too easily. This game is beyond casual to the point of boring. I wouldn't even recomend this to my mother. The game can be completed in under 3 hours. (I had a lot of AFK time in menu screens - whoops). The controls are weird. Works better with my touchpad over my razer mouse.			"

												If you don’t mind a game with almost no gameplay elements and you are looking for something diferent to relax in the cold winter, 39 Steps might be the game you are looking for. Sit back, get warm and grab a cup of tea or coffee because you will only need to move your mouse every now and then. You play as Richard Hannay, a man from London during 1914 with a boring life whose fate changed after a certain event. Now, he’s being chased by a crime he didn’t commit. And that’s when the story gets interesting. The game reads like a book, and you won’t have any choices to make like, say, a Telltale game. You just explore your surroundings, read some descriptions, and move on with the story. The game does not lie about this, their premise is really honest and you should know what you are getting into, you will be reading a digital book with some clicks here and there. As the story goes, tension will go up as things may get troublesome in the road making Hannay finding different means to get what he want weather by escaping, stealing or using his wits and words with strangers. The visuals of the game are calm with vibrant colors. They are hand painted with minor movements like the wind and it will remind you of some old point & click adventure games. During your play through you will also find some collectibles by explorations. These are very hard to miss, especially if you are playing the game carefully and take your time to look at the scenario before being done with it. After 4 hours I finished the game and I do not find any reason to play it again. It’s a different experience and it was something I rather enjoyed. The final chapters make the conclusion satisfying and I was engaged in the game from start to finish. When I finished a chapter I just had to go to the next one as I was too curious to know what was going to happen or how Hanney is going to find a solution for his current problem. Because there’s almost no gameplay mechanics involved this games ended being quite relaxing. You can be very tired after a long day at work sipping your hot beverage while playing 39 Steps and it’s going to be a nice experience.  "

												All visual novels i’ve come across seem to follow that choose-your-own-adventure line while catering to a very certain, slightly perverted, teenage fanbase. This instead is what you could call a multimedia thriller, combining the classic narrative with beautiful hand drawn backdrops, fitting audio and some basic animations. All combined it makes for a very immersive experience, and with the excellent quality of the source material writing there is an actually gripping story driving the game forward. It was a captivating 4 hours experience that changed my conception of what can be done within the rigid structure of a visual novel. Highly recommended as such.			"

												This is actually a really rather excellent little experience. It's everything you might hope it would be, from the limited description as an ""interactive book"". It's an atmospheric, detailed, and ultimately engaging way to enjoy a classic novel. I'm still early on in the story, but I'm already sold. It really is rather excellent.The developers have done a great job, and you'll really enjoy devling into 1914 London. Quite frankly I hope they do some more books in the future.It's true that you don't actually ""do"" all that much, but you honestly don't notice. The way you engage with the game world to reveal the story feels pretty organic. It's a bit like GONE HOME, but more honest and enjoyable.One tip: You can pretty the left mouse button to progress if the ""rotate the mouse"" doesn't work for you (as it didn't work for me).Recommended!

In addition to reading, you will be able to click on some locations. By clicking you can find helpful items or clues too. Nature and enviroment are fantastic. I have to mention really good music and sound effects (rain, noise of trees, birds...) which gives perfect atmosphere to the game. In this game you forget on graphic. I really enjoyed this game.

												Let's be clear: Going through this will be exactly as if you're leafing through the novel with illustrations of the various setpieces, while voices act out the various dialogues and music plays in the background.You'll be looking at gorgeous, static illustrations, reading the novel's text phrase by phrase, and listening to the dialogue voiced very competently by various actors.There are no animations, except for some story-within-the-story segments presented as a puppet theatre, very entertaining, sadly in short bursts.Some sound effects help to set the scenes, and the soundtrack is very engrossing and does the most to add thrill to the experience.Even the characters are not shown; you'll only see static silhouettes. I really didn't like that. Maybe it was meant to not impose an image of the character upon the reader. But combined with the rest of the static experience, it just felt lazy.Besides, you unlock character cards as extra content viewable in the main menu, and the characters are illustrated there, in full detail. So why not expand it to the rest of the adaptation?-------The Thirty-Nine Steps (the 1915 novel) was important because it was one of the earliest examples of the man-on-the-run thriller. As such, it is held in high regard, and has been the subject of many adaptations in film, radio and theatre.But let's face it; for today's reader, it's a pretty dull story.And seeing how this is a digital adaptation of the novel, it's impossible to view the two separately. It's inevitable that you'll experience some boredom due to the source material. So the question now becomes, what does this adaptation add? Does it present the story in a way that enhances the experience? Is it immersive? Does it expand your view of the story's setting and details?I'd say yes. I read the novel for the first time, right before playing this. And putting aside the vague boredom I felt both times, my understanding and immersion was definitely higher while playing this.This being England and Scotland, and the 1914 version of both at that, seeing them illustrated before me certainly helped me be transported there, since I'm so separated from the story's setting by both time and space.Unfamiliar terms and objects now made sense because I could see them (e.g. dovecot) Certain sequences now played correctly in my mind. Etc.It could have done more. It could have shown characters in full detail rather than as silhouettes. It doesn't have to become a cartoon, but animations for important actions would have greatly improved the storytelling.------------Personally, I would have preferred a completely different way to present this novel. I would love a proper, 3D first person experience of the whole thing, think Dear Esther or Gone Home. Even if it was still entirely linear. But I understand how that would be difficult, even impossible (how do you present a linear story if the player can run around London and the moors of Scotland?)For what this sets out to do, it does a very good job. Not perfect, but a very good job indeed. I look forward to more adaptations from The Story Mechanics and I hope they improve their formula.			"

												This title is an interactive novel that has the trappings of a Point-&-Click game, but mostly a linear affair bound by its adaptation of an existing work. No need to fret however, since there is much to praise over its graphics, music and most importantly – plot that would hold you on suspense for its entire duration.While I avoid spoiling the story for you, I can safely say The 39 Steps revolved around a conspiracy, set in a turbulent era just prior to World War One. As Richard Hannay, you’ll have to negotiate a passage through treacherous terrain, along with an equally treacherous world of espionage to uncover the truth. Since this was written by John Buchan and not some contemporary hack, I have yet to find someone who thought the plot was boring.This adaptation however, held an odd twist, a bigger conspiracy hidden. I believe the developers had laden this game liberally with subliminal messages, telling me to eat and drink excessively at every given chance. I did not place this accusation lightly and I’ll list out my observations as evidence. Throughout the game’s duration, the protagonist would: -Palate the many palettes of fine whiskey.Cure a hangover with full English breakfast.Discuss the merits of brandy while travelling light on train.Savour fresh organic produce in an idyllic farm.Sample various Scottish cuisines by a road side inn.Show a fierce steak no quarters in a noble’s hunting lodge.Devour a traditional sandwich upon the Scottish highlands.Scoff down ginger biscuits under a star-lit sky.Valiantly vanquish a pork pie while fooling the main villain.Learn that muffins go well with marmalade.Puff up to cloud nine over an assortment of cigars and pipes.And that it is always a good sport to interrupt your enemy's dinner.The pace of Richard Hannay was literally set by meals and the man will eat at every opportunity available. While the game can be strangely patriotic in British culture at times, I was taught first hand to never mess with a Scotsman on a full stomach. Seriously, playing this game made me hungry more than anything.Jokes aside, I was very impressed by the level of art presented in each scene, of which all seemed to be drawn by hand and occasionally animated too. It was definitely a higher standard than what I was used to in other visual novels. Same goes for the music, which is just as suspenseful as the story itself, the two complimented each other very well.If you are looking for a good distraction that will last around six hours, you should look at this underrated gem. As for me, I enjoyed every minute of it. I will recommend you to play this with a full stomach however, or you’ll end up depleting your stock of snacks as precariously as I did.			"

												Not as engrossing as I thought it would be, but overall not a bad adaptation.A little time consuming however, and after a while gets tedious, I don't think I ever spent more than 30 minutes actually playing it at a time, and often found myself wandering AFK to do something else as it never kept my attention.

												A fantastic visual novel. You can play the game with just your mouse, but you still feel immersed in the story. I enjoyed the way the dialogues were plotted out, and the way you get to see inside Hannay's mind through text over some very gorgeous imagery. Fans of the book will love it, and maybe some who play it will go out and read the novel. When it is on sale there's no reason not to buy it!			"

												The 39 Steps is a digital adaptation of John Buchan's incredible book following the story of Richard Hannay, a man framed for a murder he didn't commit and his path to solve the riddle of The Thirty-Nine Steps.The game combines literature, gaming and film concepts perfectly, providing an astonishing experience.The gameplay is simplistic, the visuals are wonderful, the soundtrack is excellent and the story is superb.The 39 Steps provides an amazing experience and I certainly recommend it.

												Just a few minutes ago I finished playing ""The 39 Steps"" and I must admit, that I loved the game.I personally do not know neither the book nor the film by Hitchcock but I still really loved the game.It is not a usual game as you might expect it, as it tells you the whole story of the book while giving you the possibilityof clicking on things from time to time. When I started playing the game at first I was not to sure what to think of the game but in the end I basically could not stop playing. This was mainly due to the absolutely fantastic scenario and scenery, which could almost be described as paintings.All in all I was very pleased to have found and played this magnificent game!			"

												The 39 Steps is an interactive fiction game or experience where you play as Richard Hannay, a regular British citizen in 1914 who was living his normal life till he meets a character by the name Scudder. After being introduced to Scudder at that time, that's when Hannay's life went downhill a few days later when  Scudder was found murdered in Hannay's home	. This caused Hannay to leave Great Britain for the time being to run away and hopefully prove that he's innocent and he did nothing wrong. After all that, he gets caught with a shadowy enemy group who want to kill Hannay to cover the whole murder up. Then Hannay becomes a free-man with the help of some allies but he still must be on alert for the evil shadowy group. All in all, I highly recommend this game or interactive fiction experience because it's intense, action-packed, and filled with mysteries/questions.			"

												Not a book, and not quite a movie, The 39 Steps is hard to describe.If you've played any, this game is probably most like playing Visual Novels, except the story is on a set course and there are no choices to be made. Instead interactivity comes from other places: You preform certain actions that have no real impact on the story, and get to choose exactly how deep you get into details and backstories. If that sounds a bit boring, it's really is a lot more like reading a book than playing a video game based on one, and I suggest you approach it as such.  Visually, it's very impressive. The text is accompanied by beautiful backgrounds mixed with old photographs and very fun animations, directed in such a way that really makes the text dance.Fair warning though, this game is quite obviously really aimed for touch devices, the mechanics would work a lot better there than on PC, and it lacks real customization options, so if you have the option go play it on one of those, if you don't it won't bother you too much though.All in all, I'm definitely looking forward to their next work. This is a very unique and new way to experience books, so if you like reading I'd definitely check this one out. If you don't, keep in mind that this is not a video game in the traditional sense, and this might not be for you. "

												Playing through the whole story took me close to 4 hours, and having paid £0.99 for the game when it was on sale, I found it to be unbelievable value for money.It's a hard game to praise, or criticise, as it's not really a ""game"" in the traditional sense at all. Self styled as a Digital Adaptation, it has varying levels of interactivity, but plenty of depth.Although I can't really praise the game makers for the story, I can say that it is beautifully exicuted. My one complaint is a really daft set of sequences where you need to draw shapes with the mouse in order to make Hannay do things like open doors and windows, or run. They feel awkwardly shoehorned into the game and also make it feel much more like it should have been developed for a touchscreen device.However, this minor complaint does not take away one jot from the overall experience.

												I've played through the entire game and really enjoyed it. The dialogue, ambient sound, music, beautiful artwork, and text combine well to set the mood and create an immersive experience not unlike the feeling one gets when reading a novel.You should understand that there is very little gameplay in The 39 Steps. It is a visual novel, not so much a game. But don't let that deter you from playing. While text is the primary means of conveying the story, there aren't any walls of text to read. Instead, you'll be reading a few sentences here and there while you watch and listen. (There are some newspaper clippings with long articles, but it isn't necessary to read them except to further immerse yourself in the story's world. None contain information integral to the plot.)The 39 Steps hews pretty closely to the novel on which it is based (by John Buchan), not the Alfred Hitchcock movie which diverges pretty significantly from the novel.The experience of playing The 39 Steps stayed with me for a long time afterward. I later found myself seeking other similar games in an effort to recreate the experience. I never did find any quite like this one. The closest I discovered was Dear Esther, but that game's narrative structure is much more ambiguous. The 39 Steps employs a more traditional novel-like story structure.			"

												The 39 Steps é um jogo que conta uma história de um conto policial, com um engenheiro que quase se tornou um detetive (com a sorte e ajuda de outrem) e com um pouco de  mistério. Este jogo tem um quê de Sherlock Holmes (inclusive faz referência ao personagem, à saga e ao autor Arthur Conan Doyle). A história é bem interessante, mas demonstra faltar alguns pontos chaves com elementos não tão detalhados e simplificados (subjetivos).Sobre a jogabilidade em si, você não precisa fazer muita coisa. Basta ler tudo o que o narrador-personagem vai contar (que é o protagonista) e clicar em coisas brilhantes que te chamam a atenção e que o personagem vai notar e usar junto aos seus conhecimentos para dar continuidade à história (semelhante a um Hidden Object). As cutscenes do jogo mostram ambientes bonitos e bem feitos (que parecem telas pintadas ou fotos antigas de lugares a céu aberto ou ambientes bem mobilhados). Você ainda tem a possibilidade de fazer desenhos com o mouse (nos momentos em que o personagem vai abrir portas - normalmente, nada de arrombar - ou abrir janelas, garrafas. O jogo indica no canto da dela a quantidade de coisas que você pode encontrar no ambiente para ajudar seu personagem e a quantidade de parágrafos que você também vai passar por . Além disso, a história contada pelo personagem só dá continuidade quando você dá um clique com um mouse para ela passar ao próximo texto narrado. No mais, a história segue seu curso e você não faz muitas interferências (no máximo pular as cutscenes e entender nada da história e perder conquistas do jogo por causa disso).A OST do jogo, apesar de não ser tão diversa nos diferentes momentos da história é boa. Acho que se encaixa bem no que o jogo propõe e os sons utilizados também. Por fim, eu gostei do jogo, porém acho que ele foi pouco explorado. Ele tem uma proposta muito boa (pelo menos para mim) e poderia ter sido mais legal ainda com poucas mudanças. Mas entendo que a proposta talvez tenha sido essa desde o início, e é um modo de contar uma história. 7/10. "

												 I must say, The 39 Steps really impressed me. It presents the perfect blend between video games and books. The game is essentially a visual novel, but a rather special one. It's a digital adaptation of a espionage thriller, where the main character is Richard Hannay, someone who is put on the run due to certain events to which I won't spoil for you. The story is engaging, and the way it's told is creative and original. Besides the beautiful hand drawn art design, the sounds effect are splendidly united with the phrases you'll be reading throughout the main events. The progression is linear, something expected. Simple actions are executed by dragging your mouse in certain directions (such as trimming Hannay's beard, for example), and those end up adding immersion to the game. The voice acting is remarkable and the only problem I had with it was due to the not understandable scottish accents, but that was easily fixed by turning on the lyrics. Various objects can be explored and viewed from different angles, and The 39 Steps, at times, even is educative in a way that it provides information on the history at that particular time, around 1910. The achievements are easily obtainable, as they are completed by finishing event after event, which function like a chapter in a book.Conclusion: The 39 Steps changed my perception of how this concept of digital adaptation of a book to a video game can be astonishingly enjoyable. It is rather unique amongst this genre, and I expect more of these by the same developer. Absolutely worth your money!Screenshot:

												This is a digital adaptation, not a game.It's damn good at what it does. The voice acting is top notch. I never found myself being critical of the actors. The art work was excellent and really depicted the scenes well. The only mark on this experience was that although the music was fitting, some of the melodic and atmospheric tracks suffered from improper looping.Other than that, it was a truely immersive experience.With that said, I would recommend this at $15 or less. Why? If you enjoy these sorts of productions then you can't go wrong with this one, and perhaps the proceeds will funnel into the next project, of which you may be awaiting like myself, with great anticipation.

												I can't really call this a game.  It's more of an interactive novel.  A game-novel. The artwork and time-piece images are plentiful and beautiful.  The audio acting is decent to pretty good, sometimes captivating.  The story itself kicked off really well until eventually flip-flopping between interesting and suspenseful to silly and irrelevant, back and forth, until it finally culminated into a nose-dive, imo. Overall, I think the design concept is excellent and I look forward to more like this. Preferably sci-fi stories.  As for The 39 Steps, check it out when it's on sale. Or when you want to keep your interactions with your computer to a minimum.			"

												A wonderful blend of visual novel storytelling and interactive playability is The 39 Steps. Travel back in time with me, as we make passage into the early 1900's London as you the player must free his good name from corruption and conspiracy as a framed man for the murder of an intel spy. Move from the comforts of one's London flat into the spacious hills of Scottland in hopes of avoiding the police units and hired muscle of the black stone crew. With achievements and badge progression this title is progressive on profiles and the story is quite interesting. Can be completed in a single playthrough why not pass the buck for this gem. Id recommend this peek for anyone.			"

												The 39 Steps, based on novel of the same name in 1915, is simply a digital adaption of the written form.  This is not a game.  There are several interactive elements (e.g. using mouse to make specific gestures, looking for hotspots within rooms) but those elements are just to provide some layer of interactivity.The real schtick here is the superb voice acting, hand-drawn backgrounds/props, sound effects, and music.  In the traditional sense, this would be classified as an adventure game.  But there are no personal/story choices to be made as there is only one path, and that path is the novel.Alfred Hitchcock created a movie, which I have not seen, based on the novel, and other similarly themed movies like North by Northwest, which I have seen and do like.  If you like spy/deception stories like these movies, there is no reason why you wouldn't like this digital novel.I would love to see more adaptations like this; simple and easy experience to relax without dealing with the craziness of modern gaming.  It takes audio books to entirely new level. Also imagine doing this format with branching storylines.			"

												Really nice visual novel. It's not really a game, you just click some objects in the scenes to unlock the next piece of the storytelling, but you also have to perform certain mouse movements a few times (like when opening doors). It's a good choice if you want to just sit back, relax and enjoy the story as it immerses you. One of the things I liked about it is that when a chapter is done you're brought back to the menu, where you can select the next chapter to continue the story - this gave it a bit of a suspense for me, although the story itself is already a suspense.

												As this being a visual novel and not a classic video game it might not be made for everyone, but I was pretty much hooked from the first chapter onwards. This digital adaption of an english literature classic is executed pretty well, with beautiful hand drawn background stills for most of the time and an overall excellent atmosphere. The rare voice acting is good overall, the animated portions are great and the reading of the text isn't painful. There are one or two game mechanics which could have been handled better, but as this being the first of its kind that I am aware of, I must say the developers did a pretty good job and I am sure they are able to improve the really small annoyances in potential next installments.Highly recommended if you like to read (interactive) books/thrillers on espionage in the dawn of World War I, because this one is worth it and I really hope to see more digital book adaptions in the future.9/10			"

 Scottish hospitality	I enjoyed this game experience!At first I was a little put off by the clunky controls (rotate mouse counterclockwise...), but this turned out to be easily mitigated.Its an interactive novel, of sorts...With that I mean that while its you, as a player/reader, than control the pace of the story, you have no influence over what will happen, you simply uncover the next step.This means that game has no replayability, that is unless you have a somewhat bad memory or are very fond of the artwork in the game. Because the art work is at times very pleasing to the eye, several of them (a monoplane at sunset springs to mind) would have been nice to have had as backgrounds, but alas.I thought the voice acting was more than decent too.So, if you are looking for a good story, don't mind games that are good for one playthrough, and you don't demand action every minute to be entertained, I'd recommend this game. I got mine very cheaply indeed (thanks Indiegala), but its worth a few £/$/€.Oh, not to forget, do stay till the end of the credits :)			"

												Just to be clear this isn't a game; taking that in, its far from perfect, if you plan on clicking 2000 times; dedicate your entire pc b/c switching windows glitches your save point so you have to start all over again. if i wasn't so tenacious i would have discovered that if you ever lose your save point when you switch back to the window click the add button and that creates the save point you need to contiune where you left off (tedious and annoying, but works..). The most interactive you ever get is drawing mouse gestures to open doors, i was super disappointed not to be able to at least have a mini-game to solve the pocketbook cipher!?!I don't know where these other reviews came from, but they failed to mention all the bugs and repetitive music, and bland scenes, sometime you don't even know when to click, because it switches from voice actors and back to reading again so frequently.I'd rather read a 20 page short story and fill the rest in with my own imagination.

												This is what visual novels should be, not borderline hentai anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The 39 Steps is a very very very very very good digital adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 novel of the same name. I remember reading these early 20th century novels such as The Great Gatsby in highschool english class and thoroughly hating every word in them. The 100 year difference between then and now simply just does not translate well in text form due to changes to speech and culture this past century. This game however was able to keep me hooked in a novel from this time period, I was engrossed in this thriller about pre-World War One conspiracy. The voice acting (despite using the same old english dialogue that I usually have trouble understanding in the book)  and art are both top notch and really helps to sell the immersion. Also the game mechanics, while simple (this is a book after all, there are no alternate paths in the story and there is no fail state) are enough to keep the player engaged with what is going on. Whether it be reading an authentic looking newspaper that tells more about the world or even just simulating the opening of a door knob with the mouse. For anyone interested in a casual yet suspenseful story The 39 Steps is well worth checking out.			"

OVERVIEWThe 39 Steps is a ""Digital Adaptation"" of the classic early 20th Century spy novel of the same name, by John Buchan.The game closely resembles a visual novel in form, although rather than offering dialog choices or decision trees often seen in visual novels, the 39 Steps instead offers a number of different methods of interaction and multimedia presentation of the different scenes.GraphicsThe graphics in the game are quite beautiful in places. In my opinion they get better in the second half of the game, with outstanding painted landscapes mixed artfully with what look like computer drawn sections.The game makes clever use of different visual effects throughout, with moving backgrounds, animated portions, photographs, short videos, and textual effects. The graphical presentation is excellent.SoundThe characters in the story are all fully voiced with convincing English and Scottish accents (unsurprisingly, given where the game was made). I'm not an expert on the period so I don't know if they're historically accurate, but they are definitely professionally done.The game features occasional sound effects to emphasise actions and events in the story to good effect. Music, too, is atmospheric and suits the storyline well; the music in the closing credits deserves a special mention, reminding me of ""The Dead Eyes Opened"" by The Severed Heads. It's very cool, indeed.GameplayThe game plays similar to a visual novel, but with much more variation in presentation. Unlike most visual novels, however, there are no real choices for the player to make. It is possible to skip some of the text and investigation sections, but I don't know why anyone would want to do that.Interaction with the game is also different from any other visual novel that I've played, with different sections requiring mouse rotations, clicks, and gestures. It felt a bit weird at the beginning, but I became used to it quickly and it worked well enough.Not having read the original novel I don't know how closely the in-game text matches it, but the story kept my interest throughout. I wouldn't play through it again, although that's more a consequence of the type of game, rather than the specific content. I did notice a very small number of grammatical errors; I'm not sure if these are present in the original novel text.The 39 Steps is not so much a game, as such, but rather a multimedia interactive experience -- a digital adaptation, as the developers claim.PROS AND CONSPros:+ An interesting story presented in an original manner+ Beautiful art+ Atmospheric music, professional voice acting, and good sound effects+ Clever use of visual effects to enhance interaction with the story+ Steam achievements and trading cardsCons:- No replayability to speak of- A very few grammatical errors- Retail price seems a bit highCONCLUSIONI'm very impressed with the 39 Steps and I'm glad that I took the time to play it all the way through. Given that it only took a little over four hours for me to complete it and I don't plan to replay it, at full price it doesn't pass my own personal value test, but it's often available at deep discount or in a bundle, and at only a few dollars at most, it's a real gem.8/10 "

												""The 39 Steps"" is, down to its core, a slightly-interactive-novel. That being said - it's not ""bad"" by any means. For what it is, it's incredibly well done, and a means in which I would love to continue consume various forms of classical fiction.Based on the original espionage thriller ""The 39 Steps"" by John Buchan, you can definitely see where modern day spy stories came from - predating popular fictional characters like James Bond by at least 30 years. This story takes place on the verge of WWI and introduces a character named Richard Hanny, a man on the run after a young American spy divulges sensitive information to him. The game is presented mostly in beautifully painted backdrops, fuzzy silhouettes and the occasional shadow puppet show (of which are quite entertaining). These backgrounds take you from inner-city London, to the moors of Scotland and back again. There isn't much gameplay to be had (to my slight disappointment), but what is present is likened to that of a game like ""TRAUMA"" - drawing shapes and clicking on things to carry through the cutscene-like chapters.Simply put - the game is awesome for what it is - but it really needs a bit more interactivity. There is one part that involves the character decoding a notebook. I got really excited, thinking that I'd at least have a mini-game or a puzzle to figure out the code, but alas - the game just carries on like the book. They allow you to zoom in and out on objects you see in the environments - here I am, thinking that I'll have to do some Sherlock Holmes work and pick out clues from the zoomed-in objects, but alas - there isn't much to discover but a few timeline-appropriate advertisements and newspaper articles.I would love to digest all sorts of fiction this way. From Sherlock Holmes to H.P. Lovecraft to Franz Kafka - I would love to have this sort of artwork and voice acting and sound effects, mood, pacing, attention to detail, and the ease of taking it in via separate chapters (just incase I need to leave and come back to it) - albeit, more interactivity would be preferred			"

												This is an interactive visual novel that re-tells The 39 Steps by John Buchan. I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable even though the pacing was a bit slow for me at times. And by that I mean how the game chose to pace scene transitions and such. Once the thriller part of it started, I wanted to be able to ""turn the pages"" much faster, but the game demanded it's own pace. Still, it's a great story and well worth the 4 hours or so if you like the spy/thriller genre.Rating: 7.5/10Excellent story, great visuals, but could be a little faster in execution to keep the excitement up.

												First things first: this is not a game but a digital adaptation (with some interactive elements) of the same-titled novel.Having read the book I have to say they did well. It starts off a bit slow until you get used to the means the story is told with (e.g. newspapers you find, movies that tell parts of the story, dialogue scenes with brilliant voice acting). Once you get past that it's just as good as the book is (which has a slow start as well mind you).If you explore everything thoroughly it'll take about 4,5 hours to finish it, well worth the money especially if you get it on sale. Be warned though, this is only available in English. For those having trouble understanding the different dialects there is an option to have it all in ""standard"" English - even with Gaelic subtitles if you'd like that.Get this if you like some creative entertainment that goes beyond video games. And if you have played a bit of Team Fortress 2 I'm sure you'll burst out laughing just as I did when the French General talks about the nature of the spy.			"

												I'd just like to start off by saying that The 39 Steps is by no means a game, but more of an interactive graphic novel, based on the book.The art is quite something to look at, and the voice acting is as genuine as it gets. I picked it up in the Groupees Be Mine 9 bundle, and it costed a total of $0.25. At that price point, it was definitely worth it. However, I wouldn't persuade you to get it for anything over $5, as, like I said before, The 39 Steps is not a game.To avoid any and all spoilers, I won't say much about the story itself, other than it is as good as it gets when it comes to John Buchan.All of those things aside, there is no Steam Cloud support for this game, which isn't too much of an issue. There are in-game extras to collect, including cards and different awards, which are awarded to you by progressing through the story and experiencing all the content. The Steam Achievements are all progression-based and thus are easily achieved, similar to The Walking Dead.Also, it took me just over 200 minutes to finish, so you can expect to finish up with The 39 Steps in around 3 to 4 hours.

												If you're interested in the story of The 39 Steps, you might be better off buying the actual book. Just to make things clear, this isn't really a game, but rather a visual novel. Personally I think the story was intriguing and the visuals were nice too. But I finished this 'game' in under 3 hours, so I guess a bunch of details of the original story have been left out in this 'digital adaptation' of the book. So, if you're really interested in the story: Get the book. And if you're not really into reading books, but do want to know about The 39 Steps: Get this 'game'.			"

												The 39 Steps is a visual novel closely based on the book by John Buchan, written in 1915. The text is presented to you in small chunks, so you can follow the plot tirelessly. There is also some minimal gameplay that requires you to perform gestures, which is accompanied by an interesting retro movie photography style. The game's strongest point would definitely be its amazing voice acting that puts a lot of popular titles to shame. This title is definitely recommended for avid book readers, or anyone else that feels like giving this genre a try. However, if you expect anything more than a well presented book with a twist, this game is not for you, obviously.			"

												I usually don't have an interest in interactive novels but the storytelling & writing is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, I was on the edge of my seat the entire game & I was blown away on how interesting the game is because it's based on a real book by John Buchan (I never read the actual book but I can tell the devs were big fans of this guy so I have to give Kudos to the devs for making this game, here's some info about Mr. Buchan https://archive.today/kyv1K if you want to know what other books this guy made).Pros:1. Interesting Story2. Suspenseful Music3. Good Voice Actors4. The game is based on a real book5. Good art6. Interesting characters7. It is 19 chapters long which to me is decently longCons:1. Most people will complain that there is not much gameplay but the whole point of the game is story driven so I don't consider that an issue but some people will be turned off about thatOverall this game is perfect & if anyone has an interest on interactive novels then I suggest starting on this game so you can get the idea on how those novel games work (Here is some info on the original book version of The 39 Steps https://archive.today/xnbeq so I suggest checking it out).

												The 39 Steps isn't necessarily a great book, but the way the novel has been made interactive is a step in the right direction. Personally, for me, the story contained too much politics, which I hate with a passion. I can't help it. I just have no interest in it.  But the way this 'game' has been executed is done in a terrific way. I was actually talking with my girlfriend about how I'd love to read books like this, with beautiful high res pictures and dynamic text in it, and the voices recorded like you're listening to an audio book, with each person doing his/her part instead of just one and the same person.So, basically, this is an interactive novel. Reading this novel should take you anywhere between 3 or 4 hours. Short enough to keep you interested and long enough to tell you its story.One thing I didn't care for was the fact that there are a few Scottish conversations in it, sometimes being spoken with a certain accent. It was hard to follow at times, so it would've been nice if there were extra subtitles for those parts. I really had to concentrate to understand it. It's the only flaw I can think of, so if you're an avid reader you might want to give this a read.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												I don't feel like this game is as interactive as it could be, or at all. It feels more of just a visual novel, the other annoying aspect is whenever I Alt-Tabbed out, it would completely start over from the very start and not let me skip through cut scenes and that I had already watched. Never been a huge fan of visual novels, this game is visually easy on the eyes, the art is fantastic and the voice acting is very good, I also really enjoyed the soundtrack. But the gameplay itself is severely lacking and the constant starting over if I had to alt-tab out really ruined it for me.			"

												THIS IS NOT A GAME. That needs to be made clear because someone expecting a game of some sort will be disappointed. It's not even a point and click that requires any thinking. This cannot even be compared to Phoenix Wright. This is a book with digital pictures and voice-work and rare animation. It is aptly described as a digital adaptation. How do we set it apart from a book with pictures? Sound, voice-work and interactive page-turning.That said, here's the review: WHAT IT DOES, IT DOES VERY WELL. The sounds are crisp and very effective, the voice-work is professional level and well cast, the artwork is beautiful, the pictures (i think they are retrieved from actual existing sources of non-fiction, such as newspapers, museums, etc.) go the distance and the work put in to get them shows, to me, the passion with which this work was made. The soundtrack is also excellent and hightens the mood.I enjoyed the craftsmanship here.The thing is, it does harm to both the worlds it draws upon: - as an interactive game, it never challenges you, never makes you think, never puzzles you, nor does it require any skill to advance.- as a book, since you don't go through it at the rate you read a book, at the pace the author envisioned, it ends up not being as thrilling. Plus, it gives sound and image to something that never lives up to the reader's imagination, a common complaint in film adaptations.You could say that, like a film, that's bound to happen. The difference is, when you're making a film, no matter how faithful to the source material, it frees itself from it because the author of the film knows it's a new medium and that, in that respect, it's something new. It's the film's author approach.Here, since it's just a helping visualization, there's never that approach. Just images, sounds and transitions.To sum up, this is a very well made digital adaptation. Go through it and you'll see the passion about the project and the tremendous respect for the book. I loved this because i spent every second appreciating the level of craftsmanship (my hat's off to thee, Simon Meek. I'll buy the next one) and the fine words of a great book, but, since i'm on Steam, i'd suggest either reading a book or playing a game. Those of you just wanting to play a game or reading a book will end up frustrated both counts here...			"

A great pre-World War spy story by John Buchan and now you can have it in your Steam Library.I would have never thought that I'd be enjoying a digital book adaptation as I enjoyed ""playing"" through this one. One must know that it's not a game in classic terms rather a story you follow. And it's such a great story it kept me up till 1:00 AM yesterday (or rather, today).The music and the pictures are superb, with great voice acting.

												This is a graphic adaption of the 1915 book by John Buchan, not an actual game.  You follow this spy yarn by clicking your mouse to progress the story.  There is a lot of reading spiced up with some good voice acting.  Occasionally, you have to perform some very simple searches of a scene in order to get all the exposition provided.And then there are the silly mouse movements that you have to follow in order to do things like open doors, make telephone calls, or create explosives.  These consist of following the on-screen instructions and matching your mouse movements to the graphic - up, down, left, right, clockwise circle, counter-clockwise circle.The graphics are 95% static, the only movement being the occasional smokestack spewing smoke, a flag flapping in the wind, or falling rain.  The artwork is lushly handpainted, not your typical computer game graphics.  There isn't much music, but they do a fine job with the voice acting and a few sound effects.Even if you take your time and read every word carefully, you can reach the end in 5-6 hours.  There are achievements, but they are for completing chapters.  So if you finish the ""game"", you will get every achievement.If you don't mind reading a Reader's Digest version of a 100-year old spy novel, then this might possibly be your cup of tea.  I suspect that most of today's gamers would take a pass, but I found it mildly entertaining.			"

												First of all, it should be pointed out that this is not really a game. It is a cinematic adaptation from a novel, and although you have some small interaction ability, you´ll be more time watching/reading/listening than actively making things happen.The adaptation follows the original novel quite faithfully, so your choice of skipping what can be skipped or the order in which you decide to uncover the clues will have no consequence on the result.

												First of all, it should be pointed out that this is not really a game. It is a cinematic adaptation from a novel, and although you have some small interaction ability, you´ll be more time watching/reading/listening than actively making things happen.The adaptation follows the original novel quite faithfully, so your choice of skipping what can be skipped or the order in which you decide to uncover the clues will have no consequence on the result. It must be said also, that the 39 Steps is a novel that has a particular old-fashioned flavour: As many works of the same period, it is full of national -British in this case- pride, is filled with not too politically correct stereotypes about foreigners (basically Germans) and can be even funny because of its naivitée in many aspects.

												I didn't read the book, but after I finished the game, I think, I never will.The story wasn't that exciting, although it's supposed to be a thriller.After a while it gets pretty slow and shallow imho.. (could be different in the books idk)BUT.. I can't rly dislike this ""game"", as it's really well made, with stunning artwork and quite professional voice over speeches. I guess the developers put much heart into their work and therefore deserve a certain appreciation.Definitely recommended for impulsive sale purchases!			"

												This is a visual novel based on a novel published in 1915.  Interaction is mentioned a lot in this game's reviews, but it's minimal even by the standards of other narrative heavy games on Steam.  I didn't feel like I missed out because of that, but a lot of people do.  What you're getting if you do stick with it is a lot of nice art, voice acting that suits the writing style, and a look at a book that's considered a classic among the espionage and thriller genres.  I was impressed more by what the writing suggests was taken for granted by well to do people in the UK at the time and how people apparently spoke than by the story, but the story was still good enough to keep me interested.It might be a little overpriced at $14.99, since the book itself can be had for less than that, and the game's descriptoin seems to oversell the interative bits, but I still have give it a thumbs up for bringing a classic novel to Steam as well as it did.

												It took me roughtly 5 hours to beat this game. I mostly played offline so it only said I spent 2 hours.This is not a game actually. It is an interactive graphic novel with lots of conversations. The voice acting, which makes up most of the game, is really fantastic. The sound effects are equalty amazing. I like how the studio treating foot steps, coin flipping, handling twisting, etc with fullhearted devotion. I really like the graphic style as well.The plot took place in Britain in 1914, right before the First World War broke out. The story deeply intertwined with the crises in the Balkans. This is an adaption of John Buchan's 1915 novel of the same name. I won't let any spoiler bothers you. All I can say is that this game tells a conspiracy theory regarding the casuastion of the war.This is a thriller. I enjoy every moment of it. I hate it when games trying to use all the annoying puzzles to stir the fluency of a story. You will find no part of that here. God I love this game.			"

												This digital adaptation of the John Buchan adventure novel is an enjoyable production.  The visual effects are wonderful; the art is beautiful and provides vivid illustrative context to support the narration.  The voice acting is also really good.  I will add that there are no puzzles to solve -- its limited player interaction and use of odd gestures to move the story along place it firmly in the visual novel realm.  I recommend this for any player looking for a laid back, rich, and intriguing storytelling experience.  You won't be disappointed.			"

												This visual novel is based on a book.  I probably wouldn't have picked up the book, but as a 'game option', I figured why not...  It's easy to get 100% percent achievements as long as you view all of the content. There are a few scenes where there are objects to click for a closer inspection and cinematics (which should be viewed for the achievements). I came up short an achievement at the end. This achievement can be gained by watching through the credits until the next scene. There really wasn't much player interaction, with the exception of several scenes requiring a series of mouse swipes across the screen as indicated by a row of different pointing arrows. At first I was confused and tried to get all artistic, overthinking the whole thing, but it just required pressing the left mouse button and drawing swipes in the direction arrows are pointing. This isn't a choose your own adventure. It has a set path. I'd recommend it if your mood is somewhere in between... 'Should I read a book? or watch a movie?' I enjoyed the story, the artwork and voice acting.			"

												Interesting. A visual novel of the classic World War One era spy novel by John Buchan. You'll follow an English gentleman who has made his fortune in Africa and has grown bored out of his mind, when he stumbles onto an international conspiracy and rapidly gets in over his head.Beautiful art, funny and innovative storytelling techniques, great music. The interactive segments are integrated with the narration well and feel like they serve the action rather than just pad it out. That said, interactivity is not its main attraction, so if you're not content with story alone this may not be for you.Recommended with the caveat that this is very much an experience to relax and follow rather than to try and drive forward.

A great pre-World War spy story by John Buchan and now you can have it in your Steam Library.I would have never thought that I'd be enjoying a digital book adaptation as I enjoyed ""playing"" through this one. One must know that it's not a game in classic terms rather a story you follow.

												This is a graphic adaption of the 1915 book by John Buchan, not an actual game.  You follow this spy yarn by clicking your mouse to progress the story.  There is a lot of reading spiced up with some good voice acting.  Occasionally, you have to perform some very simple searches of a scene in order to get all the exposition provided.And then there are the silly mouse movements that you have to follow in order to do things like open doors, make telephone calls, or create explosives.  These consist of following the on-screen instructions and matching your mouse movements to the graphic - up, down, left, right, clockwise circle, counter-clockwise circle.The graphics are 95% static, the only movement being the occasional smokestack spewing smoke, a flag flapping in the wind, or falling rain.  The artwork is lushly handpainted, not your typical computer game graphics.  There isn't much music, but they do a fine job with the voice acting and a few sound effects.Even if you take your time and read every word carefully, you can reach the end in 5-6 hours.  There are achievements, but they are for completing chapters.  So if you finish the ""game"", you will get every achievement.If you don't mind reading a Reader's Digest version of a 100-year old spy novel, then this might possibly be your cup of tea.  I suspect that most of today's gamers would take a pass, but I found it mildly entertaining.			"

												As a fan of visual novels, I really enjoyed The 39 Steps, as that's basically what this game is. There's not much to do but read along, occasionally clicking a few things for some extra information, and as such the game may not appeal to traditional adventure-game lovers. However, the casual interactivity is more than made up for with the excellent story; I wasn't aware of John Buchan's novel previously, as I'm normally not one for espionage tales, but I was thoroughly engaged by this on-the-run spy thriller. The game follows the story of restless gentleman Richard Hannay, who forges a new friendship which rapidly plunges him into a world of deception, cover-ups and murder. The artwork throughout the game is attractive, with decent music and ambience, and great voice acting (including a cameo from Greg Hemphill of TVs Chewin' The Fat fame.) While the theme of the story is dark in nature, there are some amusingly light-hearted quips well-delivered by the cast, and in the form of a few shadow-puppet style scenes.Pros:- Consistently good art style and sound- Excellent pacing, it neither drags nor feels rushed at any point- Has the old-timey feel of a classic book, without feeling dated- Decent playtime (over 5 hours for me) Cons:- It's a few pounds more expensive than I would expect for this sort of gameOverall: The achievements are almost entirely unmissable, presenting a lack of challenge in that department, but it does make for a relaxed, enjoyable experience where you can really focus on the story-telling. I would personally consider around £3 cheaper to be a fairer price, but I have no faults with the gameplay itself, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a strong story-driven experience.			"

												The game has a very interesting story which I will not spoil much with this review (but the Sucky Gameplay will a bit), but I assure you that the story is interesting. Gameplay-wise I will say that the game sometimes moves too slow. There are a lot of pauses in story advancement, like showing a scene of the street ant stuff like that. It kind of makes the game a bit boring to play. A lot of the game is reading the story. Some of it is ""investigating"" which basically is looking up items on the screen. But yes, this game is heavily story-focused, so if you're looking for good gameplay, this isn't the game. If you're looking for a good story, this is the game you've been looking for.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review. Spoiler alert.

												There are some game that are just the usual rubbish that just are games and nothing more. But there are the exceptions- games that push the limits of what it means to be a game. And I personally think ""The 39 Steps"" pushes the boundary the most, because it's hardly a game. Does it have fine points about it? Sure! It's got a great soundtrack, excellent voice actors, great background sounds, and well-done backgrounds. But I feel like how I felt with playing ""Over the Void"". All of this seems to be covering up how little the game actually has to offer. I played the game in roughly 3 hours because that game made me move at that pace. If I was in full control of the speed of the story, I bet I'd be done in roughly less than an hour. All the gameplay is melted down into clicking. Nothing complicated. Nothing at stake. Which really undermines the purpose of the achievements of the game. Oh, you clicked 15 times in this game! Ding!I don't mind point-and-click games but usually if you have some control of choice over the game. And choice over a game doesn't have to mean the way the story turns out. Sometimes the choice could be how you handle a situation, what steps you take to get somewhere, what items you use on an object. And 39 Steps takes all choice away and turns the game into a tourist ride of fun places around Scotland... PowerPoint Style. But it's a well-designed PowerPoint, I'll give it that!The story is decent. I never had read the 39 Steps, but I knew what to expect from older novels and this one's no different... the pacing is about as slow as a turtle trying to swim through maple syrup, and it doesn't help with the gameplay being slow, either. Sure, slow stories can be just as effective and the story in 39 Steps has it's moments, but there are a lot of long drags, and one particularly occurs with so much repetition you forget what's supposed to happen in the story. But the story, the good and bad parts, I feel I should give no credit to the the designers or the game's total score. I feel like it'd be better placed in a book review, since the designers just cherry-picked their favorite quotes of the story and threw the words in while an intense chase scene in occuring, undermining any slight tension the player might have been feeling.If you want to experience the 39 Steps, or you're a connoiseur of PowerPoints, this is perfect for you. I happen to be a gamer that prefers to actually play a video game, rather than watch it with short intervals of clicking.			"

												This game has grabbed me and didn't let me go even after it said ""THE END"" in the center of the screen. (Mainly because I somehow didn't get the last achievement which I actually completed all requirements for) I got this for free through a promotion, but it is actually worth the money you'd have to pay for it, because it's super addictive and really catchy. It also offers beautiful drawings and a wonderful, partially hilarious mix if a variety of British accents. I recommend this to everyone who likes mystery stories and a good novel. It took me about 4 hours to finish the game while reading all of the text and paying as much attention as I could to not miss a thing. Side Note: Not recommended for anyone who's got and kind of CoD in their steam library.			"

												In the 39 Steps you play a bored UK citizen who gets involved in a complicated conspiracy right before the beginning of WWI. The game will get you hooked really fast because of it's great story (it's an adaptation from an actual novel), beautifully painted scenarios and awesome voice acting. It's not an actual GAME, though, it's more of an experience, a new way of storytelling. There's not a lot of interaction - you just have to use your mouse every now and then to keep the story going, and that's pretty much it. However, the game manages to never get you bored by delivering the story in different ways: sometimes you get dialogues, sometimes you have to explore around a scenario, look at a newspaper, watch a small movie (I loved those!), etc. The BEAUTIFUL landscapes, accompanied by great music and sound effects will do the rest to keep you in the right mood. I finished the game within a weekend, and it really felt like reading a good book. Whenever I wasn't playing, I was thinking of it, wanting to get lost again in the lovely Scottish glens. I believe that videogames are the future of storytelling, and this is a brilliant example. Very much recommended!			"

												Not a game, but a good interactive retelling.The storytelling itself is solid and refreshing (HOPA genre game makers take note, but also take note this is not a HOPA), but pacing does get a little let down by some of the presentation in parts. It is an interesting format for absorbing a text though.  For those unfamiliar with this story. You can seek out the books or the James Bond series which was heavily influenced by this.  The thrilling conclusion doesn't pack the punch that Hitchcock achieved in the film adaption, but Hitchcock rewrote the entire story and meaning of the 39 steps to get that ending.I don't think this would take anyone 5-8 hours to complete as it says here. I missed one achievement in the playthrough I did  because I was trying more to keep pace with the story than to gain all the badges.			"

The 39 StepsAn early 20th century adventure novel by Scottish author John Buchan. The first of five novels it follows protagonist and narrator Richard Hannay,  an upper class toff, retired officer from her majesty's armed forces and expatriate of South Africa.Not so much a game but an interactive book with some lovely artwork, you enter the story bored and lonely in London, a man waiting for life to begin again. The basic controls are introduced as you are encouraged to explore each scene. The amount of detail available, through the likes of newspapers and maps, had me entertained for sometime and helps to remind you of the social, economical and political differences between now and what most consider a short time ago,After the first chapter I began the ""game"" again with my partner and found the experience even more rewarding. We continued on a few more chapters and went to bed. The funny thing is the next day I found myself thinking about Hannay and his predicament and we couldn't resist returning that evening to see what was next. It is quickly becoming part of our schedule, our bedtime story and a favorite in our hearts.Recommended for entertainment, not really a game but great for those who enjoy the lost arts of reading and imagination.

Interactive movie? Interactive novel? You hardly had to do anything and it was a cool spy-adventure, which I enjoyed. You could probably get it for under 1€ at either steam or some other site.

												This interactive novel is an interesting attempt to bring the book to a new generation. The ""fish out of water"" feel is good, as a guy found himself far deeper than he'd ever imagined. But that's the strength of the book. I'm not quite enamored of the interactive part of the title. Most of the interactions are minimal such as click to advance, click on object to inspect (very little of that), then some mouse stroke movements to perform certain actions in sequence. Some of the text was arranged in a ""spokes and wheel"" format which makes reading in sequence somewhat frustrating. On the other hand, the illustrations are nice, music is decent, and text eiminently readable. I'm just not quite sure the ""interactiveness"" made the book better or worse. For now, recommended.			"

												Not a game, more along the lines of a slightly interactive novel.  Your interactions are mostly limited to dumb stuff like dragging your mouse in certain patterns to open doors and the like, so not much to say on the gameplay front.  Story-wise, the first half-hour or so of the game can drag, but it soon picks up and turns into in an interesting ""man on the run"" thriller.  The voice acting is solid, and the art direction can be rather nice at times.  The story sucked me in enough that I played the last 2.5 hours of this 3-4 hour game in one day.If you're interested in a compressed version of the book, you could do far worse than this adaption.  I've never bothered with audio books, but I imagine if you like those, something like this may be an experience you'd might want to try.			"

												Very torn on this one. It's a ""digital adaptation"" of Buchan's espionage story  The 39 Steps,  and it's about as well-made as a visual novel can get. The voice acting is superb (performed by a real theater company, I believe), the gorgeous hand-drawn artwork really makes you feel like you're in pre-WWI Britain, and the overall interface is sleek without betraying the lovingly-rendered throwback aesthetic.Unfortunately, the story itself is the main thing holding me back from giving this a more enthusiastic thumbs-up. It's essentially an innocent-man-on-the-run thriller, and the middle 3/5ths or so of the game basically have the main character escaping one sticky situation after another, with little in the way of actual plot or character development taking place. Because this is a straightforward novel with no player choice involved, this middle section really dragged for me as chapter after chapter of near-misses began to give me deja vu. The story picks up some momentum towards the end as the main plot finally begins to unfold (there's a global conpsiracy involved, which is always fun), but don't expect much in the way of action or suspense; the climax felt appropriately genteel for this most old-timey of British thrillers. (The original novel was written in 1915, so what do you expect).With those caveats, I do recommend this game to visual novel fans, both for its production value and because the story does ultimately maintain some interest even during its repetitive middle chapters.  P.S.:  This was the first project of a development team called The Story Mechanics, and it looks like their intention was to produce ""digital adaptations"" (their term) of various literary works, beginning with this one. I went looking for them online and was sorry to see that they appear to be defunct, which is really a shame given the amount of skill and obvious enthusiasm they brought into making this game. Hopefully they'll return in another form? P.P.S.:  I've never actually read the novel this is based on, but I have seen the Alfred Hitchcock movie version, which is fantastic and you should definitely watch it regardless of whether you get this game. (Though I was confused why the main character in this game didn't have a woman handcuffed to him while he was on the run... only to realize that Hitch probably threw that in there just to spice things up. Not a bad call, really)			"

												Depending on the classification you choose, The 39 Steps is either incredible or inadequate. As a visual representation of a novel, it's sublime. As a ""visual novel"", it's subpar.I've never read the novel nor seen the movie/stageplay/etc, but I now understand why this tale has been adapted in so many forms. Trapped in an intriguing espionage narrative, the protagonist must use his wits and fists to solve the mystery... and, more immediately, to survive. All the while you experience the dread of a man on the run, not knowing who to trust or where to turn. The ending is anticlimactic (though it may have been mind-blowing a century ago), but this story is focused on the journey and that it delivers well.Of course, if you just wanted to hear a good yarn, then you could read the novel, so the developers accentuate the tale with gorgeous visuals and terrific voice acting. Nick Underwood (portraying protagonist Richard Hannay) is the standout, seamlessly moving from accent to accent as Hannay adopts disguises to flee from his pursuers. The lighting effects, the haunting score, the use of shadows all blend together to create a perfect atmosphere of tension.Unfortunately, only the character dialogues are voiced, but the rest of the text regularly serves the mood, appearing quickly during sudden revelations or rotating slowly during moments of panic, for example. The developers did a wonderful job incorporating several forms of storytelling, including humorous silent film-esque animated segments to relate stories-within-the-story... which makes the gameplay missteps all the more frustrating.As I said earlier, The 39 Steps greatly succeeds as a visual presentation of a novel, but spectacularly fails as a game. The worst part is that the developers were clearly trying to play up those aspects. There are quicktime-like events requiring you to move your mouse in certain directions, allowing the player to share in the experience of... washing up... opening a box... opening a door... but not during any of the action-driven sequences, missing a prime opportunity to enhance the immersion.For every room with multiple hotspots, there are a dozen transition screens with only one button. It says ENTER or DOOR, but it might as well read ""click to continue"". Meanwhile, much of the side content is presented as white text on otherwise featureless black screens. Tie those details to objects or characters in the room and you have the framework of an adventure game. Instead, the ""player"" receives an unfiltered info dump, followed by the opportunity to click CLIMB (and only CLIMB) in order to progress the story. Obviously it's impossible for real choice to exist within a set story structure, but a little more of the illusion of choice would go a long way.In the end, I recommend The 39 Steps for what it is - a visually and aurally pleasing piece of high drama - and warn you about what it's not - a game. That said, with only 5-6 hours of content and the ""replayability"" of a novel, the $15 price point does seem a bit high.			"

												Visual novels are usually not my cup of tea, so I might be biased here.In any case, I don't find this one particularly good. Neither the story, nor the actions that have to be perfromed in order to progress with it.Particularly, I don't get the concept where you have to make some specific mouse movement to open doors or perform any other trivial task. It seems as that was the only way the developers found to catch the ""player's"" attention. Completely unnecessary.Avoid. "

												This is NOT a game, but an experiment to digitally adapt a classical book. It is a new form of entertainment.http://thestorymechanics.com/digital-adaptations/I bought it out of curiosity when it was on sale. I haven't read the book myself in real life, but I know someone who has and she has practically told me every explicit detail of the book itself. This digital adaption remains true to the original work, while the movies are notorious for taking liberties in every kind of direction.Each backdrop is a hand painted background. This makes me wonder how long this actual production took to make? Also when you see the list of people's names in the credits at the end, your jaw will drop with the sheer army of people needed in creating it. This therefore makes me question, especially in this day and age, if this style of entertainment and the amount of money which is needed to create and publish it, will honestly be wasted when trying to sell it to the gaming community at large? The interaction which is needed to propel the story forward is negligible and while the story has it's moments of suspense here and there, there are still large blocks of moments where nothing much is really happening. The digital adaption will largely play out as an audio book decorated with backdrops, however there are also significant parts which require you, yourself to read or click to skip it entirely. The option to have it all acted out for you is simply not there, which since it most of the time plays out like a movie, I was disappointed that it did not do this all the time.Most gamers today are conditioned to want constant visual stimuli at high octane speeds, to be entertained every millisecond. This type of production does not do that. Having said that, I still enjoyed it myself as something different. Though they have given birth to a new form of entertainment, this concept while it is still in it's infancy stages it does have a lot of room to grow and mature and it will be interesting to see how this concept flourishes. Might be a worth a look if your into classical literature. Definitely a wait for a sale.On a sidenote apparently 1914 welsh/cornwall/English was as jibberish as Klingon. Have a google translator on standby...			"

												I really wanted to like this game until I ended up actually playing it.  I mean, I could see how it might be fun to play on a laptop during a long flight or something.  But honestly I played this game for 10 minutes and was so bored out of my mind I had to quit.I'm not saying it can't be a good story, but for someone who likes to read (a fast reader at that) this is an incredibly slowly drawn out story with crappy navigational mechanics that involve swirling your mouse around clockwise and counterclockwise to either skip or go back a previous line in the dialog (of which there is no shortage). Also this game goes waaayyyy too far into detail with the setting and the background of the characters.  When a new character is brought in you literally have to hear their entire lifestory before continuing.  Personally I have no idea how the developers of the game were able to see development of this game through - and there were a lot of people in on this project something that is made abundantly clear in the title sequence.  On a positive note, I really like the simplistic art style and theme.  It makes it stick out and deserves a good storyline. A+To really quantify it, what really ruined this game for me was the unnecessary overabundance of character and setting detail and also how slow it plays.My advice to the game devs?  Go write a book.  It'd be great :)I'm really sorry that I cannot recommend this game unless you have all the time in the world to invest in a story line that gives you ALL the details with slow gamplay.  Side note: My grandmother would enjoy this game.  No joke.			"

												This was a delightful experience, even though there's no game in it. It is a visual novel with very little interactivity thrown in. To be honest the interactivity is actually done badly. There's no purpose for it and it's just a nuisance overall.Still, as a visual novel, The 39 Steps really shines. The visuals are beautiful and interesting, the ambient sounds and voice acting are superb. I'd just sit in during some of the scenes and savour its ambience.The characters are presented as outlines on top of lush backgrounds and it's fun to imagine them. As you play you unlock cards which give a bit of characters' backgrounds and show their appearance. These are accessible through the menu. I only found out about them once I was done with the story but I think it made the story all the more enjoyable to just imagine how the people looked.If you're into visual novels this is a nice one. Just don't go looking for a game in here because there's none.			"

												Interactive fiction is something I've longed for for many years.  With the dawn of gaming PCs and e-books, I fully expected an explosion of the sub-genre, but very few surfaced after the era of ""choose your own adventure"" paperbacks and the Zork text adventure games.  Japanese manga took sole ownership of the visual novels, which left linear interactive novels without a landlord or tenant.As an ardent Hitchcock fan, I was thrilled to see another modern adaptation of Buchan's ""The 39 Steps.""  Up to this point I'd never heard of its developer, The Story Mechanics, but Steam's frequent sales made for a relatively risk-free purchase.  I expected a loose narrative voiceover with a focus on visuals in the spirit of Myst and Dear Esther, but I got a fairly straightforward rendition of Buchan's work, with occasional interactivity which can mostly be ignored if the reader/player wishes to maintain the flow of the narrative.  In all, given the the modern interactive novel of this type is mostly newly broken ground, I highly recommend this simply to experience something a little different: a compelling narrative set to beautiful hand-painted visuals, with some very capable voice acting.  I hope this title finds a degree of success because I would love to see more follow in its footsteps.			"

												Nice artwork and voiceover, but sometimes starts to be boring, and the interactive parts are a bit dumb and unnecessary.Overall it's not bad, interesting adaptation of a book. The movie was slightly more fast paced where they added a female protagonist.			"

												This isn't much of a game as it is an interactive novel, and, at that, it does a good job. I have never read the book this is based on, nor have I watched the films based on it, so this was my first experience with the story.This is a fairly good espionage story, set shortly before WWI broke out. The gameplay is minimal, and it mostly involves making the story progress. So, my recommendation, is that you shouldn't approach this expecting an action-packed game, but rather a passive experience.			"

												A visual retelling of John Buchan's novel ""The 39 Steps"" ticks all the boxes if you are looking for something that has great voice acting, keen artistic visuals and a great little espionage story. There's not much here to do as a player, and you could very well finish it over a weekend pick-up/put-down instead of watching Dr. Who or History Channel repeats. The addition of  authentic archived newspapers was a real bright spot for me. Certain parts were highlighted as relevant for flavour and the story, but equally interesting (if not amusing at times) are some of the ads for health tonics, men's moustache grooming products and the like.The soundtrack and ambiance creates just the right atmosphere as you step in the shoes of Hannay in a grand tale of pre-WWI espionage. Incidentally, parts of the OST are available for free via a link in the game forum here on Steam.A note for Mac players: The achievements currently unlock in-game only, and don't appear in your Steam profile (should that be a deal-breaker for you)Also pssst....stick through the end credits for a little easter egg.EDIT: (29/12/2015) Achievements still do not work on Mac (and Linux, though there is a work around for Linux) but there are now trading cards included in the game.

												The 39 Steps has been designed with such attention to detail that it positively oozes the stuff, which makes it more intuitive than many other interactive visual novels I've had the pleasure of reading. As per the title, there are a total of 39 chapters, each of which is a self-contained slice of the overall story, with beautifully drawn scenes and objects. Gameplay is fairly simplistic, and is no great stretch to the player - or should I say reader or watcher? - as in some other titles such as Puzzle Agent. Flowing seamlessly from one element to the next is no easy feat, and yet this game manages to accomplish it.Maybe it's ironic that an interactive novel creates an experience that is hard to describe using words alone. Definitely a hidden gem, if any title on Steam is underrated it is this.			"

												This game felt like a theater play where I was just in the audience watching from a distance. It tells you a story about murder and mystery. There are not puzzles, or challenges in this game. The story was very well done, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I liked that it made you use your mind to play out each scene and to put your own thoughts into the game as to how people look and move. You don't get to see your main characters face or anyone else's face for that matter. The game does let you click from time to time on certain things to get a better understanding about what is going on. This game was fun and I loved how it played out. Getting all the Steam achievements is extremely easy, all you need to do is just play it and you'll get them all. This is a delightful game and I suggest picking it up when you have the chance.			"

												Read the book.Edit after finishing the game:This is a novel digitalized. It is very well digitalized, the art and illustrations are great, the voiceacting is very well done too. Sound effects and music are great too. What are the negatives then? Well the game is boring. There's just no point in making such a game out of a novel. The ""puzzles"" you have to solve are made of arrows you have to draw. You only click around a tiny bit, most often you just read and read. Parts of information about the environment, characters and the story. The game itself is.. pointless. It doesn't feel like a game, at times it feels even more tedious to go through than it would be to just read a thick book. Either no puzzles and the price should be way lower, or way better puzzles that actually intrigue and interest one to continue and find out more about the story than just to get it over with.			"

												A visual novel, not a game.And to be expected, the novel emphasizes alot on storyline, but half of it I can barely understand due to language barrier/accent and old English culture that require further research to understand - of which I can't be bothered.The story itself is pretty linear, you can go backward (technically) to review the older chapters but there's only one ending and one conclusion for Mr. Hannay's case. Pretty much similar to To The Moon game (another story-heavy game).Art is fine for my taste, audio is as good as an utter flat tone in the burial ceremony - I'm dead sleepy when playing.For achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s, rejoice, can get every single achievements implemented in this 39 Steps in one get-go. Just complete the game normally.Frankly 15 dollars are too much for this visual novel. It's short, and gives no replayability whatsoever. For all its worth, if you are bored playing normal hack and slash game, grab this on a 75% sale.			"

												This is an interactive novel. Not that interactive, since you spend 95% of the time reading. I was expecting an animated movie with animated voices. Instead, this is a illustraded novel and only the dialogues have animated voices. The rest of the novel is read. That was really disappointing. It's not that I don't like to read, I do read at least 1 book every week, but I hate reading on the computer. And it was supposed to be a game after all. Having to read 95% of the time made the 'game' boring, especially because the illustrations appear and move too slow and you have to press the mouse button all the time so the next sentence focus on the screen and you be able to read it. I was so bored, that after a few minutes I actually stopped reading and only kept pressing the mouse button until the end just to get the achievements. The story might be great (I don't really know the story after all), but the way it was presented in this 'game' made me not want to read it. I recommend it only to those people that really enjoy reading on the computer and don't get bored too easily. Suggest you wait for a sale. Not worth the full price.			"

												The digital interactive novel is still a medium in its infancy, piggybacking on the video game as its nearest cousin in the entertainment industry. The 39 Steps shows that there is great potential for this medium to spread its wings and achieve legitimacy as a distinct form of entertainment.The presentation of the events in this work is simply stunning; everything from the artwork to the music to the way the text appears on-screen is always true to the tone of the moment.The story itself is rather good, too. Many of the characters are absolute delights to see interacting, and the voice work for them is really top notch.As long as you go into this expecting not a game, but a dynamic and mildly interactive retelling of a classic story, I am sure you will be pleased to play/read/watch it. (Incidentally, we really need a new verb for this.)			"

												My god this is dull. The standard of presentation in terms of the interface, the artwork and the voice acting is excellent. If only it could have been used in service of a better story. The first couple of chapters put the pieces in place for a potentially interesting tale of political conspiracy, however the ensuing several chapters squander this potential by taking our unlikeable protagonist on an endless run through the Scottish countryside, stopping to have a natter with whomever he accosts. In between the banal smalltalk, I struggled to remember what exactly the plot was, and consequently had little idea what was happening when it finally picked up the pace in the concluding chapters. This game represents a brilliant execution of an awful story. Avoid.			"

												First off, as has been stated here time and again, this is not a game.    That said, it is also not a book.  And therein lies the source of most of the negative Steam comments.  Yes, it is slower than a book, but does that necessarily make it tedious?  I am inclined to say, ""no"".  Today's super-hero immersed, action thrillers, contain so little plot, it could be contained by one written page, maybe half a page.  And yet, they are consistently called, ""fast-paced"".  A painting talks hardly at all, does this mean it does not say anything?  I think a better may to approach this new art, for art it surely is, is to consider it as an interactive-comic-book-movie hybrid.  The reader sets the pace of his exploration.  If one wants to explore the beautiful moorish vistas, he may.  If he wants to read every letter of a simulated 1914 newspaper, he may.  If he simply wants to hurry through to the end, he may do that too, to his own detriment.  The pace is not slow, as much as it is metered.  The interactive-comic-book-movie, or icbm as I shall now so intelligently dub it, can not be completed in an hour, although one could surely read the text in this amount of time.  It slows the pace, to a line, or even a picture, at a time, giving the viewer time to reflect upon the work, and, for me at least, time to become immersed in the story.  Where a Marvel movie might have me bored to tears, and a novel by Dickens might encourage me to speed read past my tedium to my have-done list, I found the icbm totally engrossing for its duration.  Considering its often discounted price, I found it well worth the money.  Currently the price of a comic book or movie rental, it provides about 5 hours of enjoyment.  Not only is it a better bargain for entertainment, it leaves a sense of intellectual satisfaction.  Having bought it as part of a Humble-bundle, it also sated my frugal-pride.  On a side note, while I enjoy Hitchcock as well as film-noir, I could never get myself to appreciate the confusion of his film adaptation.  This version I loved.  It taught me to forget about the movie, and enjoy the icbm.  To finish, I would encourage anyone with an interest in books or art, to check this little number out.  It think most will find it well worth the look.			"

It's some kind of graphic novel and has one mayor flaw: There are no real people in this game because all characters are shown as a ghostly shadow, if at all.

												Please don't get me wrong, I'm all for interactive narratives, but this feels a lot more like a VERY slow-paced Powerpoint presentation that doesn't even let you skip a slide when you're done reading it. Interactivity goes as far as unnecessarily making you click 4 times in 4 different directions just to turn a door knob (as if that would make it 4 times more interactive I suppose?), so you'll find yourself mindless clicking along until you reach the end.

												I must say, The 39 Steps really impressed me. It presents the perfect blend between video games and books. The game is essentially a visual novel, but a rather special one. It's a digital adaptation of a espionage thriller, where the main character is Richard Hannay, someone who is put on the run due to certain events to which I won't spoil for you. The story is engaging, and the way it's told is creative and original. Besides the beautiful hand drawn art design, the sounds effect are splendidly united with the phrases you'll be reading throughout the main events. The progression is linear, something expected. Simple actions are executed by dragging your mouse in certain directions (such as trimming Hannay's beard, for example), and those end up adding immersion to the game. The voice acting is remarkable and the only problem I had with it was due to the not understandable scottish accents, but that was easily fixed by turning on the lyrics. Various objects can be explored and viewed from different angles, and The 39 Steps, at times, even is educative in a way that it provides information on the history at that particular time, around 1910. The achievements are easily obtainable, as they are completed by finishing event after event, which function like a chapter in a book. "

												Bought this game on a whim on a Weeklong sale, and was not disappointed. This game does take the form of an interactive story, rather than a true action/adventure game; so those looking for that type of experience may want to steer clear. But for those of you who simply want to get immersed in an enthralling (indeed, classic) story complete with richly drawn environments, a fine score, and superb voice acting, this is absolutely the game for you. It's also a quick game, and can probably be completed in a few sittings if you find yourself with some spare time on your hands. Overally, a very good experience for the price.			"

												This is an interactive novel that starts out slow but it can draw you in with the characters, story, and atmosphere it creates. Although it is not something I would normally listen to, I liked the music since it added suspense and matched the pace of the story. The hand-drawn scenery of the Scottish countryside helped illustrate what the author described and was enjoyable and relaxing to watch. Overall, the presentation of the story was well done and I felt the people responsible for the presentation were passionate about the story they wanted to portray.I have not read the original book and I do not tend to read novels that have not been assigned to me. This was an exception. Not only did I enjoy the story, but I also enjoyed the way the author depicted fear and paranoia and used suspense to build up a sense of imminent danger for the main character.For anyone considering buying this novel, I think adding this interactive novel to your steam library will give you a far different (and better) experience than adding another game. Hey! It is called a steam library, so why not add a book? "

												I purchased this game thinking it would be interactive fiction of the type I grew up with, only modernized. Obviously I hadn't researched it enough beforehand, but I was familiar with the piece it's based on which made it a quick sell.At first I was furious! This wasn't interactive fiction! Where's my command interpreter?10 minutes on and I was curious. Fine, it wasn't interactive fiction as I knew it. This was something else. Something worth investigating.20 minutes in and I was hooked. It felt like I was being ushered along by a storytelling mannequin in the most stunning of garbs. The depth and nuance of the written work was there, dressed differently but most certainly there.			"

												I found this to be a wonderful experience, but it certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea. You interact with the plot, but only to drive it almost constantly forward and there is no branching of any kind. However, despite that rigid structure, the presentation of the world and characters is beautiful. The graphics are generally quite static, but commonly overlaid with subtle animation, lighting effects and focus shifts so that it never feels like you're really looking at just a still image. The voice acting, music and sound editing are also exceptional and I must confess that I liked that they didn't dumb down the period vocabulary or authentic accents. It is a slow affair, however. I really wouldn't be able to argue with someone who finds the story plodding. Still, as a fan of classic Hitchcock, games like The Last Express and Dear Esther, and the works of Agatha Christie, I quickly connected with this interactive novel and consider it a very worthy addition to my virtual library.

												Had I understood what I was going to play before I started I might have enjoyed it a little more. I was expecting a heavily interactive adventure game but instead found myself on a linear path that occasionally asked me to poke around a bit with the mouse. This all left a rather bad taste in my mouth creating a distraction from being able to palate the storyline at first.Albeit the story itself is easily addicting once you get past the dull introduction of the protagonist, but then again I guess that might be the point! Much like his life things start off quite uneventful but quickly snowball into a suspense filled thriller that has you truly fearing for his life every time things heat up.That aside the scenes in this are gorgeous and immersive MOST OF THE TIME. Occasionally you are required to execute some gestures with the mouse while staring at very ugly black and white real life stills, and watch some horrendous silhouette cut-scenes. I felt these elements created random and abrupt interruptions from the world they were painting with the main styling.It has its ugly moments BUT I found this to be a fascinating escape from what we normally consider to be a game in the end.Feeling casual? CHECK IT OUT!			"

												I've been in a search of different ""games"", and so, this one intrigued me, specially since it didn't even advertise itself as a game, despite being release on Steam. So... if not a game, what is it? A ""Digital Adaptation"" is what it calls itself. It's essencially an adaptation of a book into a more visual format, with a little more interactivity. I've got to say, I'd rather read a book most of the time, than ""playing"" one, unless there's something to take from it that I wouldn't from a book. Well, in regards to that, this is a much shorter form of a book, focusing on the essential only, and at the same time, giving some additional insight into the story's time and world through journals and such, for those interested... and, again, not a game. I usually play games for more interactivity than this has given me, at specially choice and consequence, which is something that I can't really get from a book, and which this still doesn't provide. So, all things considered, I don't think it surpasses a book for those who tolerate/like reading. BUT, it was still really well done (for what it was), and I'd say it was a totally positive experience, with lots of potential for the future. The story was really interesting (although the pacing was too slow, at times), and the whole art design helped a great deal, it was highly stylised, in a good way.For the developing team: I'd love to see this done with a ""Choose your adventure"" type of book, I think that would be the format where it would shine! Maybe do some research into old Text VideoGames and try to adapt them as well. Who knows? But experimenting is the way to go, and, for the first ""Digital Adaptation"", I think it was pretty good. I'll follow you closely and see what else you can provide.Oh, and also, a little bit more exploration, maybe with Diary Pages or Audio Logs spread throughout the places one can explore to provide more information about the story and the era it's set in.Bottom-line: Not a game, still not quite as content-full as a book, but a nice experience overall, with fitting Music and Art Style. I'm interested to see where it goes! If you think you'll take some enjoyment out of something like this, go ahead and buy it, it's pretty good!			"

So it would be way more enjoyable to do nothing at all then all of a sudden have to click again or move your mouse in a specific way to progress.The game itself is done quite good, has a good atmosphere with the artwork, voice acting and music, but thats not enough to make me recommend it.The plot isnt bad and reminded me of all the Eric Ambler books i read, but at points it just felt too unbelievable.

												I must say, The 39 Steps really impressed me. It presents the perfect blend between video games and books. The game is essentially a visual novel, but a rather special one. It's a digital adaptation of a espionage thriller, where the main character is Richard Hannay, someone who is put on the run due to certain events to which I won't spoil for you. The story is engaging, and the way it's told is creative and original. Besides the beautiful hand drawn art design, the sounds effect are splendidly united with the phrases you'll be reading throughout the main events. The progression is linear, something expected. Simple actions are executed by dragging your mouse in certain directions (such as trimming Hannay's beard, for example), and those end up adding immersion to the game. The voice acting is remarkable and the only problem I had with it was due to the not understandable scottish accents, but that was easily fixed by turning on the lyrics. Various objects can be explored and viewed from different angles, and The 39 Steps, at times, even is educative in a way that it provides information on the history at that particular time, around 1910. The achievements are easily obtainable, as they are completed by finishing event after event, which function like a chapter in a book. "

I wish the level of immersion was continued after the point he meets Walter.All in all an excellent adaptation, I am really looking forward to get my hands on any other novel adaptation from this DEV.

												I think The 39 Steps did the best job it could given the circumstances.Pros:- Interesting, suspenseful storyline that is true to the source material- Nice visuals to accompany the story- Good voice acting- Reading was given in chunks so it did not feel overwhelming- I liked how the chapters were broken up so I could play through the game at my own paceCons:- What was the deal with drawing the arrow shapes? I didn't understand the purpose of those parts.- The black screen reading moments were kind of annoying because the order in which you should read them wasn't ever made clear. I later found out that you should read them clockwise starting at 1:00- At times the dialect was hard to understandI can't say that I was very fond of the story itself, but I can say that The 39 Steps was satisfying for what it was. If you are looking for a easy and basically gameplay free story experience, pick this up.I was a little jolted at the end there, but there are no jump scares.			"

												The story is a visualization of a novel that leaves the player (well the term is really not accurate since the player does little but to scrool through the text) between the litirary, the visual, and the audble worlds, not really doing a good job at any of these.The texts are not the best, not nearly enough to create immersion. Not only that they are short, this being because they needed small paragraphs for a more fluent reading, while listening to the effects, and watching the very basic animation. These paragraphs are just not good literarywize. I haven't read the original novel, so I cannot say wether it's anywhere near the original text, but I do not belive it to be so.The charachters are not really portrayed visually except in collectible cards outside the main campaighn, inside they are mere specters that appear only during dialogue sequences. Although the audio effects, the voice acting and the music are fine, they alone are not enough to bring the story to life.I did like the news papers that were used in the game, I'm not sure wether they are authentic, having a national library in the credits raises this possibility, but they convey the feeling of the era. I'd wish there were more details like that, things that brought that time more to life.The general idea is nice, and if done correctly can bring a book to life in a unique way. But as the game is now, it is not worty of buying.			"

												This is not a game. It's an 'interactive novel'. Essentially, the whole thing is reading some text, then click to bring up more text. There are some short movies too. Fittingly enough, The 39 Steps actually seems like it might be the concept of video games someone from 100 years ago might have had. The story takes place in 1914 and revolves around a conspiracy to start World War 1 and the protagonist is the only one who can stop it. The beginning and middle of the story are decent. The main character is being chased by zie Germans throughout the country side of England. The part where he's on the lam, wanted for murder by police and being hunted down by zie Germans because he knows too much was interesting. The ending isn't all that great, and if you know any history at all, you know this story doesn't end well.  I do not recommend this game if you want an actual game. This is really just a novel with some fancy animation thrown into the mix.  Really, for the price, you should just buy a book and you'll get more out of it than this story.			"

This version is told fairly well and is nicely segmented. I think the timeline of the story is supposed to be just before World War I, but they do not make this obvious. There's some decent voice acting, illustrations, and a good story board, but it's really not something I would consider a game. If it weren't included in an indie bundle, I would have never considered purchasing it. As an interactive book, I'm not all that impressed, but there's some good effort put into it.			"

												This game represents a very interesting concept: an interactive story, animated and voice-acted. Part (audio) book, part movie, part game. I have to say, it's an ambitious undertaking, but lacks the complexity of the media it combines. It doesn't have the depth and introspection of a book. It doesn't have the gripping cinematics of a movie. Its interactivity fails to draw in the player like a more fleshed-out game. I love the idea, and the story is a classic, but it really falls short on all fronts.Beyond the presentation being not quite to my taste, the game has some glaring issues. There are a few misspellings/typos throughout the game's text. There are a couple quick milliseconds of distortion in moments where the VO recording volume peaks. I would like a final product that has more attention to detail.If you're a big audio book/storytelling fan, I'd say it's worth a shot if you get a discount. Otherwise, if you're just an avid reader and gamer, and you're just a bit curious, you're probably better off getting the original novel or watching Hitchcock's adaptation.			"

												39 Steps is a kinetic novel. Click to progress, click to look close at a newspaper relevant to the plot, do a series of ridiculous mouse movements to open a door. There's no choice, next-to-no gameplay, just text, voice acting, images, music. And in and of itself, that's all right. I'm also working through the When They Cry series, which are also kinetic novels. The problem with the 39 Steps as a kinetic novel is that it's decidedly the wrong format. You have a story about running, disguises, lying, code books, and you don't let the player do anything with any of those? Come on now. When They Cry works because it's essentially observational and relationally complex (and even then, I'd hesitate to recommend them idly). 39 Steps is an espoinage thriller, flat out. Our protagonist is driving the action, and the action is fairly active. This is not a thoughtful story, this is not an explorational story about human nature, it's a man-on-the-run tale. As such, I can't really recommend it in this format. If you want the book, read the book, if you want an adaptation, there's the Hitchcock film. This particular game format adds very little to the experience.			"

No options to be made in this game, but you need to find some items and clue to lead you to do the next plan. The graphic is good even though there no clear image of person on the entire game (just a white shadow).

												Als ich dieses Spiel gesehen habe war ich sofort interessiert.Bestimmt kommt es daher, dass ich den Film von Hitchcock gern mochte.Nun, nachdem ich es durchgespielt habe bin ich von beiden begeistert.Im Gegensatz zu Hitchcock, der eigentlich nur den Titel benutzt hat um dann seineeigene Geschichte zu erzählen, hält sich das Spiel am Buch.Da es eine Visuel Novel ist, ist natürlich kaum von einem Spiel zu reden.Bis auf wenige simple Mausbewegungen wird einem hier die Geschichteerzählt. Aber das in einer fantastischen Art. Hier stimmt einfach alles,die Bilder, die kurzen Filmszenen, die Stimmen der Erzähler.Oh, ihr solltet natürlich Englisch können um es zu verstehen.Kann ich jedem Fan einer gut erzählten/spannenden Spionage Story nur empfehlen			"

												I can only imagine two kind of persons liking this game:- Either total fans of the novel ""The 39 Steps"" by John Buchan- Or persons wanting to learn English, maybe?If you don't belong to one of these groups, don't buy it.Just to be clear, this is no game, this is just a visual novel. Summarising: you ""watch"" the story on screen while subtitles are displayed. For getting to the next part of the story (AKA more text to read), you have to click. And that keeps going for around 3h, which takes to complete the so-called ""game"". I bought this game for 1 € and still wouldn't buy it again. I do love thriller and I was expecting this story to be catchy. But even though the graphics are kind of nice, the story is dull.			"

												Game is literally unplayable with more than one monitor.You need to ""rotate the mouse"" (by which they mean the cursor) clockwise to advance the text, but the game doesn't capture the cursor so it keeps escaping to the other monitors, where it isn't detected.  And the mouse is invisible in-game, so you can't visually keep it in the window.  And sometimes you're asked to click, and if you accidentally click while the cursor is outside the game, the game minimizes and starts the whole scene over.			"

												Well what can I say about this game then? I will never get those 3 hours back. Bottom line is this is THE most boring ""game"" I have ever played in my life. I thought Dear Esther was a bad game and couldn't even consider that as a game. This, well this is just rediculous. The only reason I bought this was to get the 100% achievements as they are so easy (not that I don't mind a challenge) but in hindsight, if I had known how boring this would be I probably wouldn't have even bothered and put those 3 hours I spent on this into a game worth my while. It isn't even a game! It's more like a point and click interactive book!! So bad. And what made me laugh was how many people were actually involved in creating this game from having to wait for the credits to finish at the end to get the last achievement. Dust An Elysium Tale had 1 person only make the whole game and it's about a million times better than this crap! Please don't waste your time!			"

												I knew a digital story would not involve much action, but here, the pace is really too slow for me and there are so little actions that it does not feel like a game a all. Books and films are definitely better suited for heavy narrative, but some games manage to use the interactivity and still be heavily story orientated. This one unfortunately does not manage to do that, so there is not much reason to play that instead of reading the book or watching the film.			"

The music really makes the mood and it's good. I would buy the game just for the story and soundtrack for 5€ myself, as it has about 4-6 hours of gameplay, but fans of the genre probably would like to pay the full price.Personally I got it in a bundle for less than 1€.8/10 just because of the story and images which make it			"

												Note: There are spoilers in the updated parts of this review.  So if you don't want read on I will say this here is a 7.5 out of 10 for me only being knocked down points for some things that would not bother others.  Also this to me is an audio/visual pc book experience.  It is clearly not a game. Still a really worthwhile product and it has me hoping for more things like this in the future.I have always said no to audio books but this here is what I will say yes to.  I am totally caught up in the story and having imagery plus audio and information on the characters to refer back to as you play is just thrilling especially if you have a poor memory like I do.  I also like the artwork thus far.  Simple but perfectly fitting this.  As for the opening door mechanic where we use the mouse to do different actions I think something different would be better but it isn't taking away from the fun I am having.  Also in going through this story on Steam/pc unlike with an audio book or regular book you get achievements which are a nice little touch and looking back at them will also help remind you of what you did or are doing.  Anyway for some reason tonight I decided to start from the top of my gaming library and when I saw what this was going to be early on I thought I would quit but no it is 3:35 am and I am going to continue on.  This so far has been like a good book which is very hard to put down.  So far through almost an hour of this I recommend it to others.  As for what to pay for it well if you think the game will make you happy then it is worth buying at whatever you think a reasonable price is.  Now back to the story for me. : )  Update #1: In my second session playing this game I found a few things odd that need fixing and that is some lines of audio are repeated twice when they are not supposed to be.  It took away from the experience I was having as it had been perfect up to that point.  Also when the one chap, Marmaduke Jopely. had his car stolen and is let go he says, ""I'll get you!""  It didn't seem to fit how he would act.  It just seemed out of place. Also not sure if this was in the second session I played or not but there was a part where the audio didn't match what was said in text.  Continuity is important and this is something that can easily be fixed.  Hopefully the developer will take a look at this.  Now on a plus I have to say in regards to the menu music I like it.  Also in regards to other audio the sound effects in the game are very good too.  I am referring to the rain falling, the sound of feet scampering, etc.  You don't get this in a regular book or audio book.  Again I really like this story telling format.Update #2: Well I have completed the game and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I liked one part of the ending where the main character, Richard Hannay, whom I played said he was joining the war but he felt he had already contributed the most he could to anything related to it. I chuckled at what he was saying because part of me initially thought he was probably right but then again with his new ranking giving him more influence and if it and the thing he did with it helped win the war in any way well that might top what he previously did as he did not stop the Germans from assassinating the target they set out to get. Also in regards to the ending the music well it just seemed out of place so I got to knock this down a notch for that.  Finally instead of talking about a next story and thanking us for playing the game it should have ended differently.  I like how you rolled the credits and then saved that last speech for the end but then to put up what you did after it just seemed wrong and cheesy.PS: I checked the box saying I got it free but it very well could have been in some bundle too.  I am not sure.			"

It took away from the experience I was having as it had been perfect up to that point.  Also when the one chap, Marmaduke Jopely. had his car stolen and is let go he says, ""I'll get you!""  It didn't seem to fit how he would act.  It just seemed out of place. Also not sure if this was in the second session I played or not but there was a part where the audio didn't match what was said in text.  Continuity is important and this is something that can easily be fixed.  Hopefully the developer will take a look at this.  Now on a plus I have to say in regards to the menu music I like it.  Also in regards to other audio the sound effects in the game are very good too.  I am referring to the rain falling, the sound of feet scampering, etc.  You don't get this in a regular book or audio book.  Again I really like this story telling format.Update #2: Well I have completed the game and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I liked one part of the ending where the main character, Richard Hannay, whom I played said he was joining the war but he felt he had already contributed the most he could to anything related to it. I chuckled at what he was saying because part of me initially thought he was probably right but then again with his new ranking giving him more influence and if it and the thing he did with it helped win the war in any way well that might top what he previously did as he did not stop the Germans from assassinating the target they set out to get. Also in regards to the ending the music well it just seemed out of place so I got to knock this down a notch for that.  Finally instead of talking about a next story and thanking us for playing the game it should have ended differently.  I like how you rolled the credits and then saved that last speech for the end but then to put up what you did after it just seemed wrong and cheesy.PS: I checked the box saying I got it free but it very well could have been in some bundle too.  I am not sure.			"

												I liked this experience. A lot. There are just static screens, text and limited interactions, but it has absolutely amazing atmosphere. The presentation is limited, but sufficient. Voice acting is great and keeps you interested all the time. I can't call 39 Steps a game, but rather interactive story. It's well done. If you like books - especially detective stories, then it's something you will enjoy.I would love to see similar releases on Steam.			"

												It just has to be said. It isn't a game. It has no game mechanics that arent obsolete past circa 1994. The lead character is a tired old pastiche of the English Gentleman that you just want to ♥♥♥♥ing punch in the face and have done with it. It barely lies on this side of plausible, and often toes the line into dangerous wtf territory. Otherwise, it's beautifully painted and by the time I got to the point of not caring, I was almost to the end. This turned into a ""sure, why not"" completion. And I got it through a bundle. If a pleasure for charming and static artwork and bundled game collecting is your thing, then this game is right up your alley.			"

												As the other reviews were clear about it. This is not a game in the sense we know about. As the other guys reviews also said, this is an interactive story telling. I couldn't get myself to go through it as I felt there is too much reading/listening and I would be better off using this time playing one of my many other games. If you're looking for any kind of action, then go away, it's not for you. If you are patient and like reading and have 4 hours to spare. Go ahead, you might like it.			"

												I'm not gonna call it a game. It's an interactive novel with very unnecessary interactivty. It is based on another novel of the same name from the early 1900s.Least to say the story was at least very compelling to the point where it had me hooked enough to want to know what happens next until the end of Hannay's little adventure here.I suppose if one wishes to check it out, don't expect gameplay. Just a story with, what I feel, unneeded interacting.			"

The artwork and acting in this one are of a very high standard and It could be argued that audio and visual stimulus can bring an added dimension - but then the whole point of books is their utilisation of your own imagination.

												As a story, The 39 Steps is superbly written and acted.  As a game, I struggle to even consider it one.  The amount of interaction afforded borders on insulting mostly consisting of click-to-continue screens and swiping the mouse to match prompts on the screen while the main character opens doors and other objects.  Occasionally you can inspect scenes to find objects relevant to the story but they have no impact on the story itself.  Nearly all the interaction feels like it was included as an excuse to call this a game rather than simply packaging it as a movie or other form of digital story.If there was a way to turn off all interaction so you could just watch the story I might recommend this but as it stands the token interaction detracts from the story and makes it more of an annoying experience than anything.

I like the way they often seem to use authentic documents & photographs that help immerse us in the era better than the excellent films of the book I appreciated the attention to detail. The artwork is often so beautiful I took screen shots just for the sake of it. The music was atmospheric. I had a slow start but that may add to the sense of the character's discontent with his lack of purpose in life & urge us to seek adventure & making a contribution as he does.			"

												The story is engaging, but it's tagged casual for a reason.  Having a touch of ADD, i quickly became bored with all the reading and clicking.  So about an hour at a time is all i'll be able to muster through.  I had never heard of this novel, but this game actually makes me want to read it, so it does have that going for it.  It is simple, no learning curve and kids getting into the spy phase might really enjoy this story, and the way it's presented.  You know, kind of a simple entry into the point and click adventures like Myst or Riven.All in all, a pleasant time.The 14.99 price tag might be the breaking point though.  If i hadn't picked it up in a bundle, this would have never seen my library... so bundle it up, or steam sale it.			"

												Not having the time to play a true game, I decided to try this, which, being a digital novel, I thought I could pick up and put down at will.Well, I was half right... I picked it up alright, yesterday, and stayed up until about 4am until I fell asleep, then picked it up again at 8am this morning to get the story finished.It's not that I haven't read the 39 steps.  It was required reading at school, and having seen many BBC adaptations, and the hitchcock movie, I am quite familiar with the story.  I remember being at school, reading the passages about when Hannay is cowering in the hayloft (in my memory, may have been the mill), desperately waiting for the pursuers to move on, my heart pounding along with his....It's only many many years later that all the coincidences pile up and make me think ""Hmmm"".  The game doesn't help the coincidences, instead accentuating a few of them, which might make someone who hasn't read the book think ""Uhhh.. that's highly unlikely"".  Either way, if you can suspend disbelief, The 39 Steps is still a fantastic story, and I'm sure the base for many other stories.  So, I was very pleasantly surprised to find a game which managed to condense the book into a game, but seems to have somehow managed to maintain all of the feel and pacing of the book.   Wonderfully, all of the adaptations vary from the base text, so every version you read or watch will be different in some way, so there's always a little freshness there.  The version I watched on TV the other day had him being chased by spies just after his speech for the MP... which differs from the story somewhat...So, even if you know the story inside out, the game is a good, faithful adaptation. But, is it any good as an experience?Well, the artwork is beautiful.  Created using something like Black Ink, I guess, the settings are all wonderfully rendered, smattered with little bits of black and white photography, period references, and quaint technology.   The game designers opted to omit any live action, and instead went for a 'shadow puppet' approach, where the main actors would occasionally appear in silhouette to describe action.  It works okay, and actually you start to really appreciate the simplicity.The little 'puzzles', which amount to clicking in the right place, or swooshing the mouse,  give you a little something to do rather than just clicking the mouse to 'turn pages', which is really nice...The voice acting is excellent.  The accents are all just a wee bit off for the period.  They're ""modern posh"" rather than ""georgian posh"", but you'd have to be a real BBC drama officionado to notice.The merging of graphics, the music, the artwork, the voice talent, and the story are all excellently done too.   At points, when there 'context' information to present, it's given as a nonlinear 'wheel' of words, and you can delve into whatever you like.   You know that you don't REALLY need to read any of it.  In the book it would have been incidental padding, so it is faithfully recreated as such in the game.  I really enjoyed this, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a spy novel.			"

												The 39 Steps is a digital adaption of a John Buchan's espionage thriller.And since I don't want to spoil the story for anyone still waiting to enjoy it, I won't reveal any story details.But I will say this, the story is brilliant and has a lot of twists and turns and will keep you hooked till the end. At least that's how I've felt. The art in the game is absolutely gorgeous and the sound design is spot on as well. This is like reading a book, but you interact ingame with a mouse at certain situations and click objects on screen such as newspapers or items of interest. There are also times where you have to imitate real movements with a mouse ( sort of like in Fahrenheit / Indigo Prophecy if you have played that game).There are also cards to collect and awards to unlock while playing the game, which is a nice touch for all those people like myself who enjoy collecting things.All in all:+ Great story+ Beautiful art design+ Good sound effects and acting- If you dont like reading a lot, this game is not for youIf you are looking for a great thriller story accompanied by great art design and acting, you are going to enjoy this game. 9 / 10			"

I was captivated by the great voice acting and the interesting story and I found my self looking forward to every new piece of background art or optional information. Even tough I can´t recomend this game enough it is something that not everyone will like. If you are like me and you think that story and theme alone can carry a ""game"" then yes but it without hesitation. If on the other hand you are looking for a game with actual mechanics, choices or exploration I suggest you look elsewhere.			"

The main character is quite well portrayed and it's always interesting in which way he would approach the mostly unfavorably situation. The storytelling feels just right, with nothing seemed rushed or filled with unnecessary detail. The witting was very much enjoyable and there is just the right amount of it. The voice acting has it's good and bad moments, but is overall quite good.

												Heartfelt and captivating story. Confusing to operate the game at first, but after 20 minutes it becomes super easy. It's a story based novel game, so it isn't like a Call of Duty or Halo, but rather you get to sit back with passive clicking and take in a story. I greatly enjoyed and plan to play it again a time or two. I got it on sale 90%, but I'd say it's worth the $10. As far as achievements? Some of the easiest to get. To get a perfect game you'd only have to play for 4.5 hours, that's not rushing and actually taking my time to enjoy the game and going back to replay a few levels. First time playing a game like this. 9.5/10. You've set the bar high for other games, I'm afraid I'm only going to experience disappointment searching for more games like this.			"

												One of the better Mystery/Point and Click games out on the market. The game IS based on a book which I have never read. So, going off just the gameplay, it was great. I experienced no errors or glitches.For point and clicks, it was lacking a bit. It played much more like an interactive novel than a point and click game. The majority of the puzzles were drawing the right pattern sequence (up, down, clockwise, counterclockwise, right, left). Even beyond those puzzles were ""make sure you click all the items"", which ended up being unnecessarily highlighted for you. Which you could technically skip. What I would like is a skip for the narrative and scenary parts.Not much of a replay value, but for a point and click/interactive story, it was fun and a must for anyone who likes spies and games that lean more towards a story than gameplay.

												The 39 Steps is an interesting foray into translating books directly into the medium of video games. However, it fails to offer any real gameplay. Even its puzzles are minimalistic and offer next to nothing. So it's basically just dialogue and narration, with some admittedly well-made visuals and audio instead of descriptions in most cases.It doesn't exactly help that you have to make circular motions with your mouse to progress the text, a command that can be unresponsive at times. And when the most simple command your game offers can be unresponsive...			"

I liked how there were lots of little tidbits to investigate, but failed to bond with the narrator or any of the details presented.  The visuals were well done, but static and uninteresting.  It struck me as a kind of Downton Abbey, technically well-executed presentation about extremely mundane personalities, places, and events.  I did get the sense that it would be more interesting to just read the book instead.			"

The presentation allows you to enjoy the novel in a more engaging format than simply reading the book. Even having already read the book, I still immensely enjoyed this ""game.""  The voice acted bits are enjoyable.It does shoehorn in a bit of interactivity besides clicking next (namely, a few segments of clicking and dragging) but besdies that, there's not much in that regard.Still, a great adaption of a classic novel.

												This is a really good visual novel.Storywise this one was way better than i thought since i got it for free. The story was very interesting and exciting, it's one of the better ones that makes you want to discover more. It's told in several chapters that always ends on a high note with a cliffhanger making you want to play the next chapter.The background art is nice and felt high quality for being a visual novel, it suceeds in telling you the mood of the scene and leaves enough to the imagination to let you see it in your way.Atmosphere is the best in any visual novel i've played, the background music is very well made and the background sounds like footsteps and waterdrops is something that makes it even more immersive and interesting.This visual novel is a must play with a interesting story, good music and the best ambience sounds i've seen in a visual novel.10/10 Must buy if you are a fan of visual novels.

												A visual novel which is hugely impressive. It looks great, there is the right amount of immersibility and interaction. For instance, you have to use your mouse to imitate opening doors, in my eyes a great idea. Not only does this add to the feeling like you are inside the story and experiencing it, it also stops keeps you attention and therefore increase your immersion overall. The story is an actual book, which was the inspiration for Ian Fleming when he wrote James Bond. Overall this is a great buy for people who like stories or visual novel gamesWhitty's rating 8/10			"

												The 39 Steps is an enjoyable adaptation of a work I have no experience with, although apparently it has been a novel, play, and film and well. It's well adapted here as a visual novel, and full of beautiful art. The story is presented one sentence at a time and the game does not burden you with walls of text or too much pointless clicking around scenes. It's extremely linear, and adding in adventure game elements would only weaken the presentation, just take it as a well illustrated novella rather than a game. When certain characters and events have a backstory, the game brings it up as no more than 2-5 bullet points. For a text-based game, it certainly does not bog itself down with text.The beginning is very slow, perhaps the first 5 chapters. Partially because the protagonist is boring, partially because the story needs to be set up. You really need to get past this to decide if you like it or not. Once I was over the hump, I was hooked until I finished the story.			"

It had me on the edge of my seat about 1/4 of the way through and it only got better. Ending in one heck of a crescendo that I just loved. I was once an extremely avid reader but never read this story my main writer that I loved was King Stephen King and many others like H.P Lovecraft Robert Block and so on and I always found the best story always to get my emotions in a roil aswell And the thirty nine steps with its dramatic ending I found my emotions flowing aswell. I payed 9.99 for it a few years back and I sure wasnt hard pressed at the cost it was a marvelous story and I got my money refunded in spades by the entertainment value. I would Recommend this story to any person who loves reading and now its only a fraction of what it first cost me very worth it indeed			"

												I just finished my playthrough of the game, taking about six hours to do so. As other reviews stated, this is a visual novel.  If you want a nice, relaxing experience without quick time events or the need for quick reflexes, you'll enjoy the 'game'.The voice acting is as good as any AAA title.  Some of the scottish slang confused me, so just try to get the gist of what they say and you'll still be able to follow along, be sure to have subtitles turned on.  The artwork is excellent, and a joy to look at.  With many scenes, I would take the time to admire the detail, which is likely why it took me so long to finish the story.  Sound effects, audio cues, a lot of attention to detail was paid to this adaptation.I would play the game in the evening, with the lights dimmed in my living room, using my TV as a display to a PC running SteamOS.  Thanks to the developers for porting this to linux / SteamOS for I would not have had as enjoyable experience sitting so close to my main PC in my computer room.I am looking forward to the next title the developers release.  I honestly, had never heard of the original book until playing this title, and may look into reading it now.  The main character also appears in other books the author had written.			"

A fantastic adaptation of Buchan's novel, which I had eagerly devoured over Christmas, once again had me enraptured and on the edge of my seat, despite knowing how it pans out! Superb voice acting and beautiful visuals. Haunting at times, too! Worth your 99p! Even the full price! Only wish I had written this commendation sooner! It is, as previously stated a visual novel, so everything is preordained and very relaxing to ""play"", with none of that getting stuck on a puzzle for hours then never firing it up again. No choices to make, just sitting back and watching it unfurl. Well, I say relaxing, I was so tense and regularly had the heebie-jeebies.

												This adaptation of a novel was an excellent experience. I was immersed in the environment and loved the way the gameplay unfolded the story.  The gameplay is interesting where mouse movements are used to navigate the text – swirling the mouse in a circle moves to the next paragraph of text.The voice acting was sparse and made the moments when it was used effective. They were short breaks where you could sit back and watch the story unfold.The gameplay was subtle and propelled the story while involving you as the main character.My only quibble with the game was sometimes the music did not loop perfectly which took me out of the moment.  However, the next flick of the mouse brought me right back into it. Greatly recommended and anxiously awaiting the  next adaptation.  "

												Adapted from the 1915 John Buchan novel, The 39 Steps is a political thriller that takes place in early 1900's Europe where a bored Scot is quickly introduced to one of his neighbors who reveals an assassination attempt on a Greek head of government that will take place in less than a month. After learning of this conspirary the protagonist, Richard Hannay, ends up falling into a journey that he never imagined. The main thing you need to know about The 39 Steps before you go into it is that it is not a game of puzzles, collectibles or skill, it is a interactive game that tells a story and you are there for the ride. You click through Hannay's thoughts, then sit back and watch/listen to the character's dialogue as they reveal new clues and hints that keep you guessing through 20 segments that are nicely broken up. You can leave off at any of these points or just leave a bookmark if you need to leave in a hurry. Sometimes there are sections where you click around a room to look at objects and various texts, some of which are incredibly detailed and could probably take a good amount of time to read. There are never that many moments where you feel like you are in control of these ""investigation"" parts though, usually the only things that are interactive in the rooms are the objects that need to be clicked on, and there are is an indicator on the bottom that lets you know how many objects there are left to see in the scene or that you have already looked at. The fact that you are never controlling Hannay's thoughts or making important character decisions is never a problem in The 39 Steps though. The text is excellently placed and animated during certain scenes making it tense at one moment and beautiful at another. The choices made such as there never really being a full image of a human character while they are speaking to one another makes you think about who these characters are and why the developer decided to depict them that way. For those that are intersted in a good story in the form of a video game The 39 Steps is incredibly interesting and thrilling throughout. I would highly suggest it to anyone that enjoys visual novels, point and click games or the original book.			"

												Steam has a LOT of games on it. It also has a lot of things you could call toys; they're not really for winning, they're for playing with and exploring.This is neither. For the most part, you will click through text sections and sit through dramatised dialogue sequences accompanied by rather good digital art setting the mood for each scene, with appropriate music playing in the background. Occasionally you'll wield the mouse in something that would be a Quick Time Event if there were penalties for failure and if you were against the clock.Quite simply, this is a dramatisation of the book which proceeds at your speed and intermittently does interesting things in how it breaks the text down. If you're interested in the book, this is arguably one of the better ways to read it. As a warning regarding the book's contents, like many of its era it contains substantial racism.			"

												The 39 Steps has always been one of my favourite stories. This PC version of the story is doing it great justice (I have followed the first 7 chapters of 19 so far). The mood captures the novel perfectly and the location graphics are beautiful and very real. What I particularly have loved so far is all the period settings and the newspapers of the time. We are shown newspapers with parts of the story embedded among authentic pages of the day and I have been on a kind of side quest to look up some of the places in the advertisements, such as shops and hotels. It has been very interesting to read advertisements for places such as the Empire Hotel in Buxton (to name just one of many) and then do a google search to find out more, like when it was built, when it closed and what happened to the buildings in subsequent years before demolition. Amazing stories and pictures. A few of these places still exist today, but not many. Britain was a very very different place 100 years ago and we have lost a lot in the process. Gone is the British Empire and what an Empire we had, with the map in an earlier chapter showing this.The sounds in the scenes are also spot on.Anyway, I'd strongly recommend this title, not as a game, but as a great story with a very well produced atmosphere. I am really looking forward to steadily following the next 12 chapters.			"

												39 steps is an story-driven adventure about murder and espionage, politics and crime. The story is taken from John Buchan's eponymous 1914 book, and so well-adapted into a game - it lets you experience the story by only giving you remarkable lines and phrases and showing you minimalistic, but well-designed background pictures, thus there is some free room for your imagination (which is a plus about books, but a con when talking about films).As critics might say, ""its a text adventure with background graphics"", I strongly recommend to view some videos and get some information about the game before buying it.For there is a thrilling espionage plot to discover which speeds up after an hour. Interesting characters to meet along the journey from whom one does not know which side they are on. A hunt that begins at London, moves on to Scotland, to go back to England and has its dramatical final at the high circles of politics in London. If you haven't read the book yet and fancy for innovative adventure games, you should (first inform yourself about it! and then) give it a try! Oh, and the OST is available for free!			"

It's much like an interactive book in that it requires a lot of reading, but it has amazing visuals to go along with it. I'm not much of a reader, but I still enjoyed this a whole lot.

												Really charming little visual novel. (Not in the standard japanese genre sense, but still a novel adaptation with interaction mainly to get into the plot rather than complete certain challenges. It's definitely not a point and click in either the puzzle or hidden object manner.)There are a few different ways it's presented. Atmospheric painted scenes with text, interactive hand motions (with black and white photographs that make these actions feel somewhat more tense), and really delightful woodcut aesthetic animation sequences when characters tell a story. Those might be my favorite bits.I've never read the original 1915 novel nor seen the hitchcock film or any other adaptation, but I feel by nature of the long stretch in the countryside and the atmospheric pace, this may present a bit more of the 'waiting' bit of on the run instead of just the action. I really enjoyed that.There are some things that are odd, like the mechanic for advancing text - you circle the mouse clockwise instead of clicking. It frustrated me a lot at first (and still didn't always work when I wanted it to, requiring a few tries even near the end) but I think it did result in more investment in each bit of text and actually advancing it. Just clicking might have had me rushing through.It's not entirely without agency, you can collect certain things and get certain awards by making sure you click on and read everything (which adds flavor that I think is a necessary part of it.) But for the most part, it's an experience to sit back and enjoy rather than rush through.			"

												This adaptation of a novel was an excellent experience. I was immersed in the environment and loved the way the gameplay unfolded the story.  The gameplay is interesting where mouse movements are used to navigate the text – swirling the mouse in a circle moves to the next paragraph of text.The voice acting was sparse and made the moments when it was used effective. They were short breaks where you could sit back and watch the story unfold.The gameplay was subtle and propelled the story while involving you as the main character.My only quibble with the game was sometimes the music did not loop perfectly which took me out of the moment.  However, the next flick of the mouse brought me right back into it. Greatly recommended and anxiously awaiting the  next adaptation.  "

												OK, first thing's first: this is a ""no-game.""That is to say, it is not a super interactive game like Ace Attorney or a great visual novel. The presentation allows you to enjoy the novel in a more engaging format than simply reading the book. Even having already read the book, I still immensely enjoyed this ""game.""  The voice acted bits are enjoyable.It does shoehorn in a bit of interactivity besides clicking next (namely, a few segments of clicking and dragging) but besdies that, there's not much in that regard.Still, a great adaption of a classic novel. Looking forward to the next one they do.			"

												This is an interactive adaptation of John Buchan's book. I can see this game as a nice way of introducing literature to teenage readers or anyone who isn't into books, really. As a teacher, I know I could use this game with students of many ages.PROS:The story is great, full of interesting characters.Both the music and the voice acting are very good.CONS:The gameplay is too simple, making you wish there was more for you to do.Achievements don't work on Mac (hopefully this will be fixed).A bit expensive for such a short experience. If you can get it on sale or a bundle, do it.That being said, I'd still recomend this game.			"

												Adapted from the 1915 John Buchan novel, The 39 Steps is a political thriller that takes place in early 1900's Europe where a bored Scot is quickly introduced to one of his neighbors who reveals an assassination attempt on a Greek head of government that will take place in less than a month. After learning of this conspirary the protagonist, Richard Hannay, ends up falling into a journey that he never imagined. The main thing you need to know about The 39 Steps before you go into it is that it is not a game of puzzles, collectibles or skill, it is a interactive game that tells a story and you are there for the ride. You click through Hannay's thoughts, then sit back and watch/listen to the character's dialogue as they reveal new clues and hints that keep you guessing through 20 segments that are nicely broken up. You can leave off at any of these points or just leave a bookmark if you need to leave in a hurry. Sometimes there are sections where you click around a room to look at objects and various texts, some of which are incredibly detailed and could probably take a good amount of time to read. There are never that many moments where you feel like you are in control of these ""investigation"" parts though, usually the only things that are interactive in the rooms are the objects that need to be clicked on, and there are is an indicator on the bottom that lets you know how many objects there are left to see in the scene or that you have already looked at. The fact that you are never controlling Hannay's thoughts or making important character decisions is never a problem in The 39 Steps though. The text is excellently placed and animated during certain scenes making it tense at one moment and beautiful at another. The choices made such as there never really being a full image of a human character while they are speaking to one another makes you think about who these characters are and why the developer decided to depict them that way. For those that are intersted in a good story in the form of a video game The 39 Steps is incredibly interesting and thrilling throughout. I would highly suggest it to anyone that enjoys visual novels, point and click games or the original book.			"

												3/10 objective rating PROS:- Moderately interesting story- Moderately nice visuals (static scenery only - people are white silhouettes and interactive elements are average)CONS:- Boring gameplay, barely anything to do- Sound design is underwhelming- Voice actors don't do the source material justice.- Everything takes forever to get through- Lots of reading-----------------------------------------------------------------When I got The 39 Steps, I was expecting a visual novel adapted into a point and click type adventure game. What I got was various blocks of text I had to click with small bits of ""click here to read this"" and ""do this to open that"" type gameplay. Needless to say I became bored VERY quickly. I like casual games, and I like to do things at my own pace, but this snail's crawl was too slow and uneventful for my liking. I actually fell asleep at my keyboard twice during a 1 hour session.The sound design is mediocre and the voices are too similar - it's overall very disjointed and not cohesive as a whole.Adjust expectations before starting this game and I think anyone who just wants to read a story in small bits will enjoy The 39 Steps. If you expect any sort of action, you will likely be disappointed!If The 39 Steps would have had a narrator instead of the player needing to click for each paragraph, I may have enjoyed it more. I feel like they should have chosen to go 100% visual novel instead of 90% visual novel and 10% gameplay. It makes the whole experience unsatisfying. I will simply read the original book when I feel like it. I will not revisit or complete this ""game""			"

												Not unless you're into historical events and visual novels, this is one of the more ""interactive"" visual novels you can read or  listen to as for the ""game"" itself provides rather impressive audio and visuals.Although I myself haven't seen the movie adaptation nor read the book, this was definitely a one-of-a-kind experience. Even with the majority of the game consisting of still images it still felt somewhat of a movie to me as each change in events involved a cinematic transition. But again, it's still technically just an E-book. Don't get too excited kiddies, although I stated that this game's interactivity is higher than other novels, it still has as much interactivity as a vending machine. :P "

												this is the most effort i've ever had to put into reading a book — a very pretty book with great voice acting, mind, but the ""game mechanics"" included are both so simple and sparsely utilized the whole project probably would have been better off as an animated comic book or video of some sort. the text itself, over a century old at this point, is hard to say has aged favorably either. those who appreciate highbrow literary concepts such as ""character arcs"" and ""themes"" will not find much to be engaged with here — this is pure thriller fiction, focused solely on the protagonist staying one step ahead of those dastardly germans whilst conceiving a way to stop their nefarious plot. it honestly wouldn't feel out of place in today's AAA video game market.for something that's supposed to be suspenseful, the meat of the story falls into a sort of trite cycle as well, mostly consisting of the protagonist putting on disguises just clever enough to fool his would-be captors and/or chancing upon the most trusting and kindhearted people he could possibly meet to aid him at the exact right moment, only for him to be discovered again and forced to repeat the process. perhaps back in the day the suspension of disbelief was a little easier to uphold, but as of today i'd hesitate to call the haphazard feats of the protagonist anything but hilariously miraculous.allies regularly pop up for a scene or two before never being seen again, and i honestly can't even remember if the villains have names or not, because they barely had presence outside of being bad and scary. events that feel like they should be shocking revelations fall flat because i have little to no investment in any of the characters or their motivations. even the final confrontation, which should have been climactic, was over and done with within seconds, the epilogue equally as rushed.i was actually going to give this a positive recommendation at first, but looking over what i've written, yeah, the only compliments i could give this book are to its art and voiceovers. so in the end, i guess the biggest twist of all, was myself. dang. the end.

												TL:DR: This is an interactive storybook. It's not bad.In almost every way this is the same a picture book being read to you. This should be the mindset you go in with. If you're a fan of that, I think it does a pretty good job of telling the story and making exploration of the screen rewarding. It is also point and click. If you demand your digital people run around and do digital people things, this is not your game.The major issue with this game is its interface. As I gather, this is/was a test for adapting novels into video games. Admirable, but you might want to try and hire someone who can make the interface easier to use. Buttons sometimes take a while to register as clicked, keyboard functions are unintuitive, and if you hit Esc at the title screen, you just exit the game, which is pretty generally accepted these days to be a lazy way of quitting a game.There's also achievements and picture cards of different characters that, while I enjoy the cards, the achievements are really bad in that they never show you your progress through them. I was lucky to have clicked everything to qualify for one of them.Overall, this game is a pretty good gift for someone into point and click adventures and narrative storytellingVerdict: Get this game on sale >50% off			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine I love reading, I love reading physical books. The 39 Steps is a book, and it's one of my favourites... so thereThe 39 Steps is a digital adaption (visual novel) of John Buchan's classic of the same name. Developed by The Story Mechanics and published by KISS Ltd. This game has gotten a lot of mixed reception with gamers, however the game has gained critical acclaim with reviewers and critics across the board and I can understand both sides of the pictureThe 39 Steps is a very faithful adaption of the book, you experience the story through beautifully designed landscapes and good voice acting with very little interactionIt can get boring and yes the length of the game is extremely short (I finished it in over three to four hours and in one whole sitting) and the asking price is a bit too steep, however, The 39 Steps' story, although not originally written by the developers, and visual recreation of the novel are nailed perfectly in the gameI can understand the mixed responses from gamers about The 39 Steps and I can also understand why critics and reviewers gave this game a near perfect score and to me personally I really enjoyed playing through The 39 Steps. Yes, I have read the novel before and yes it is one of my favourite books but that does not effect the way I play the game. True, the length of the game is ridiculously short and you hardly do anything just listen to a story, however, John Duchan's novel is so well written that I just wanted to continue playing it to the endThe 39 Steps will and has mixed reception but if you are reading this review, then you are dying to know my recommendation. The 39 Steps is a game everyone should try and play and finish in one whole sitting even if you don't like reading books (which you should!) and would like another way of seeing this interesting story, then the game is the other option, however, for the retail price it is offering, I would not recommend it at its full price and rather wait for a price drop or a saleThe 39 Steps is not the game for everyone, but a majority of gamers should at least give it a try and see John Bucahn's vision come to lifeI cannot wait to see what other digital adaptations The Story Mechanics have in store! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

												This is a beauiful production -- but it's difficult to classify it as a game.  Basically, it walks you through a dramatization of John Buchan's book, ""The 39 Steps"".  As stated on the store page, this is a precursor of a great amount of more recent spy fiction, and I'd both read the book and seen a movie production (Hitchcock, as I recall) before buying this one.  This notwithstanding, I finished it because seeing how the developers fleshed it out was addictive in itself.  The game aspect (such as it is) comes from ensuring that you pick up  all the ""point and clicks"" -- although the disclaimer says correctly that it not point and click oriented.  A few comments more:  first, there is very little video per se, and the sequences, while well done, are flat and cartoonish.  Second, you will never see the characters except as semi-transparent, ""ghost"" images, and in well-done protraits that appear on a few screens.  Third, there are are a number of ""follow the pattern on the screen"" instances that on my system called for me to hold down the mouse button and crudely mimic the pattern, which really add nothing to the experience.  In summary, I DO recommend the production, but describing it as a game will, in my view, raise expectations that won't be fulfilled in many gamers.By the way,  Buchan wrote a sequel named ""Greenmantle"" featuring the hero of the reviewed work, and I encourage the developers to look at it for their next effort if they aren't already doing it (which I'm almost certain they are.)

												I read on the discussion boards that this game is classified as an ""interactive book"". I'd agree with that. I was very impressed with this game. I played at night, in a dark room for a full submersive effect. For 5 hours I was lost in the world of Richard Hannay, a witty and resilient Brit who must evade capture across the UK as he attempts to prove his innocence and foil an international assassination plot directly preceding WWI. Fans of early 20th century European History and Black Hand enthusiasts would definitely want to take a look at this. If you are looking for a way to escape this hellish joke that we call a ""life"", The 39 Steps is what you're looking for.I hope to see this genre boom, especially as VR tech becomes more commonplace.

												Not unless you're into historical events and visual novels, this is one of the more ""interactive"" visual novels you can read or  listen to as for the ""game"" itself provides rather impressive audio and visuals.Although I myself haven't seen the movie adaptation nor read the book, this was definitely a one-of-a-kind experience. Even with the majority of the game consisting of still images it still felt somewhat of a movie to me as each change in events involved a cinematic transition. But again, it's still technically just an E-book. Don't get too excited kiddies, although I stated that this game's interactivity is higher than other novels, it still has as much interactivity as a vending machine. :P "

												The history is full of misteries and could catch my atention most of the time. But, I was kinda in a hurry to finish this game and now I have this feeling I didn't actually get the most of it.If you like ""real life"" puzzles, historical/strategic situations and sound ambientation, you sure gonna like this game.The amount of journal news is quite nice too and can put you in touch with diferent events that have some relations. I liked this aspect a lot 'cause it made things more exciting and enjoyable as a curious person.The 39 Steps is somewhat short and easy to play, you just have to follow the situations and see what's happening. So, yet I really recommend it, I don't think it's worth full price because of these last characteristics.			"

												An enjoyable visual novel adaptation of a popular non-digital novel. A great tour of some of the highlands and London, beautiful backgrounds. Gives proper context to the events of the novel in the time period. Definitely recommended if you want a relaxing evening with an interesting piece of classic fiction.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this ""game"".First, for me its not a game. Its a graphic novel. To put it into the Point & Click genre is way generous cause, you dont have to think, you dont have to combine things you dont have to do anything just click the glowing 3-5 Objects on screen and read a short info or start a monologue. Thats it.Its not interactive, you are just an observer and its like youre pressing play and pause on a remote to watch the next scene of a movie.Dont be mistaken, I liked the voice acting, music, the sound effects are lovely, the art, which mostly contains of stills, which are zoomed in or out and the story is nice. Some parts are really good and leave you with a bit of tension. I would not recommend it for the high price of 10bucks on 90% discount sure even if it was a lot of work but you can get browser games for free that are better than this. For what it is, some kind of walking simulator without walking, the price doesnt fit. If you enjoy graphic novels without choices and without much effort and just want to witness a story cause you dont want to pick up a good old book, go for it, you still have to read a bit tho.Saddly, cause its a finished story, it has absolutely no replay value, play it, enjoy it, get achievements, uninstall, done.

												This is pretty much a text heavy comic book with voice overs, simple animations and some slight interactions here and there. The story is great though and some of the imagery is quite beautiful to look at if you appreciate the style, I had a tough time to draw myself away from the game when I got into it and I suspect many others if they give it a chance despite it faults might feel the same way			"

												It’s a nice story, not much “game” in it but you do have to do a little clicking and mouse moving now and then. Some people say you’re better off reading the actual book, but I enjoyed the voice acting and most of the clicking to get the story going.			"

												This is good as a novel way of storytelling. As others have said its not a game. Took me the first 30 mins to settle into it.But then I was in the story. To me it feels like a pop up book. It delivers in atmosphere. So governor for a few squid you get to experience a nice bit of intrigue. The game is improved with a glass of whiskey and a cigar......			"

												I was so underwhelmed with the first 15 minutes of this game that I can't bring myself to go back and see if I just didn't get far enough.  I liked how there were lots of little tidbits to investigate, but failed to bond with the narrator or any of the details presented.  The visuals were well done, but static and uninteresting.  It struck me as a kind of Downton Abbey, technically well-executed presentation about extremely mundane personalities, places, and events.  I did get the sense that it would be more interesting to just read the book instead.			"

												Amazing job!!! Do you remember of the books that gave you options to do within the story and change page according to your choices ? This is even better, the storytelling of this *Interactive Novel* is a trully amazing conversion from the original book, with an amazing enviroment and very crystal clear sound and ambient noises..If you like good stories, this one is a MUST CHECK			"

												You can definitely see the effort put into this one. Was the effort worth it? I would  say yes.The story had it's share of twists and turns never was I bored with it's development. The main character is quite well portrayed and it's always interesting in which way he would approach the mostly unfavorably situation. The storytelling feels just right, with nothing seemed rushed or filled with unnecessary detail. The witting was very much enjoyable and there is just the right amount of it. The voice acting has it's good and bad moments, but is overall quite good. The art was very well done.If you want a break from hardcore gaming, but still thirsty for a new experience, I would recommend trying this game.			"

												Still just as chilling and gripping. Never a full face given to any character, which lets your imagination run amok. A fantastic adaptation of Buchan's novel, which I had eagerly devoured over Christmas, once again had me enraptured and on the edge of my seat, despite knowing how it pans out! Superb voice acting and beautiful visuals. Haunting at times, too! Worth your 99p! Even the full price! Only wish I had written this commendation sooner! It is, as previously stated a visual novel, so everything is preordained and very relaxing to ""play"", with none of that getting stuck on a puzzle for hours then never firing it up again. No choices to make, just sitting back and watching it unfurl. Well, I say relaxing, I was so tense and regularly had the heebie-jeebies. I bought this originally to see how it had ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ised the novel and have a laugh at it. Serves me right for being a snob!			"

												when I first tried the game I wasn't in the mood to read a lot so I was annoyed of this gamebut when you don't want to shoot and have action and blood this is perfect! (even though there also is blood in this game)the story is really interesting and I hope the end will be great (not finished)I really like that the people are often not directly shown so you're free to imagine some things like it's with a real bookthe scenery and graphics are really nicely done and there are beautiful nature scenes in it			"

												This game is based off of the 1915 novel by John Buchan. The novel is also named ""The 39 Steps"" and is an intriguing story about espionage, crime, adventure, and action. It is quite a rollercoaster of a story! As someone who has read the original novel, I was very pleased with this game. Also, this isn't really a game, per se. This is an immersive story that relies heavily on text and imagery to draw you into the plot. Thus, if you get bored reading books, then, this definitely won't be up your alley. You cannot change the outcome of the ending, you don't really have choices, and you aren't really playing anything. You are merely (for the most part) reading a lot of text and going along for the ride. However, the artwork in this game is STUNNING. Absolutely stunning. I have rarely ever seen such rich and vibrant artwork in games. Also, the voice acting in this game is superb. It's essentially a visual novel with voice acting, more or less. The voice acting, as I've mentioned, is very well done. The scenes also change often, and, each new scene offers more beautiful art to look at. It was overall an extremely satisfying experience. Book lovers will adore this game. Art lovers will, too. I was captivated with it from start to finish. However, if you are the type who doesn't like to read or gets bored easily with games where there's ""not much to do"", then, this may not be your cup of tea. It was most certainly my cup of tea, though, and I adored every second of this beautiful game! I only hope that the developers bring more works of classic literature to life. They did a splendid job here and the makers of this game should definitely make more of these literature-based games. 10/10 from me, without a doubt.			"

												An excellent game, thouroughly enoyed it. A very well told story of a very influential novel. There isn't too much interactivity in the game but if you like stories and have patience, you will enjoy it. If you like adventure games but get frustrated at puzzles, buy this game.Beautifully atmospheric, not played a game with such a feeling for a long, long time. This game will have you looking up the prices of cottages in rural Scotland, it's that beautiful.It is short though, around 4 hours or so but it's time well spent as you would probably just be playing with yourself otherwise.One sad fact remains though, the developer seems to have gone under - a travesty as I was looking forward to their next project.

												There is so much potential in The 39 Steps! As a game it is absolutely horrible. This is a piece of interactive fiction in the vaguest sense of ""interactive"". That being said, the story is very good and the voice acting is great. If this could be branched into a true game with branching choices then it would be even better. Still, compared to some of the interactive fiction out there The 39 Steps is among the best. All that said, get it on discount. Do not pay full price!			"

												This is a game that tells a story about spies and conspiracies in England right before the first World War. It is based on a book and it shows since it has a great story and it has a great voice acting to match.It is more of a book than a game to be honest since it doesnt have puzzles or choices, it instead has optional stuff that you can inspect like newpapers that feel like they are from that time with ads that characteristic from that era. And the way the game shows you someone telling a story is made through a silent movie cutscene which just makes the whole thing feel like  something of that era.			"
