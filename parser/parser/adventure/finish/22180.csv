												Since I'm in a reviewing mood I thought I'd write a review about this game. Honestly, I really wish there was a ""Meh"" button for reviews instead of giving it a Positive or Negative because that's exactly what this game is, however I'm leaning towards Yes so I'll give a positive review.Penumbra Overture is the first in the series, the game after this is Penumbra : Black Plague and you have an additional game which is Penumbra : Requiem which is just a puzzle-solving one. These games are surrounded in horror, puzzles and story telling. Length/Replay Value	First thing that pops in to my mind when I'm purchasing a game is the actual length of the game and how much replay value it has. I purchased this game at the end of 2014 and didn't really touch it up until this day where I managed to finish it in pretty much one sitting. This game on average will take around 5-6 hours to complete... yes I said it... 5-6 HOURS! To me, I think that a horror game such as this deserves much more time to it. Is this game one I can go back and play? Not really. Maybe in a few years since I finished Penumbra : Black Plague a few years ago and now I've got the urge to play it again but other then that there isn't really anything to do in the game. No collectibles or anything like that. Just a game which requires you to avoid dogs, solve puzzles and be trapped in some creepy atmospheric mine. The replay value just isn't there. Graphical	The game was released in 2007 and still looks pretty damn good considering it was released almost TEN years ago! Of course, it won't be as good as modern day games but for it's time I would have said that this game was great and it still is! Gameplay	The game itself is actually very immersive, the music is creepy which really adds to the scary atmosphere and you are stuck underground in mines/caves with flesh eating dogs after you, massive worms and caves full of spiders, solving puzzles and trying to survive. Sounds cool right? Weeelllll... the game does start off great, the first time you enter the mine and hear the sound of a dog really does shake you up! But as the game progresses you realise that there is a lot of repetition that is used. You see, throughout this game there are sections where the level layout is very identical... similar looking corridors and mines which branch off different ways to different rooms which require you to go to in order to get specific items to progress and  using them specific items to open a ""locked door"" in one of the corridors. It gets boring after a while and what makes it even more boring is that the monsters that roam the corridors/mines are just dogs. In the caves there are spiders and there is a part with a worm but we're talking corridor/mine sequences... pure dogs. Unlike Black Plague where that had the Tuurngait [http://penumbra.wikia.com/wiki/Tuurngait_Infected], this one had dogs that you had to constantly avoid and could easily be avoided by throwing beef jerky around and locking them in cages. The Tuurngait actually carried flashlights in some stages and could see you in the dark, the dogs couldn't do that. I went through the game without getting spotted by a dog once because all I did was wait corners and wait for them to pass. That's another thing that annoyed me, Dogs are supposed to have really good noses and be able to smell stuff better than a human can yet they couldn't smell a sweaty guy trapped in a mine who was sneaking behind them or right around a corner, staring them in the face? SCARE Factor	Now this is a hard one, I don't know if it's because I'm getting older but games don't seem to scare me as much anymore unless it's a jumpscare but we all know they're no good in a horror game master-piece. Amnesia seemed to get it right. Back on point, this game had no jumpscares but was actually quite creepy when I played it briefly in 2014. If hiding from dogs, running from spiders and worms is your cup of tea then good! The atmosphere was kinda creepy? Personally though, this game didn't really have me scared or on the edge of my seat, If I was to rate it out of 10 on scare factor I would give it a 3.5/10 OVERALL	The game itself is quite an  interesting game to sit down and play if you're in to puzzle solving and a slight bit of horror at the same time. It isn't that long and isn't on the edge of your seat scary so if you're someone with a weak heart and who hates scary games then this may be for you! Would I say it's worth it's price? Yeah. However, Black Plague was scarier in my opinion. :)			",263,31,5,17,14,1,16

												This is the game that changed the horror genre once and forever. It became the point of no return. This is indie low-budget game that influenced the industry up to AAA blockbusters. Outlast, Daylight, Alien Isolation, all these run-and-hide horror type games grew up from Penumbra and tried to evolve its mechanics in some way or another with no doubt. Nevertheless this game started it all, started so called new golden age of horror games.			",32,3,0,0,0,0,0

												Penumbra: Overture is the first in a series of horror games released in early 2007. While the developers like to class this as a first person adventure game, I would also say there is quite a lot of elements of survival horror and psychological horror. The game uses a game engine called Newton Game Dynamics which is known for it's physical and realistic simulations. The adventure portion of the game focused a lot on physics based puzzles as well as a physics based combat system (i'll get more into that later). You can also play a lot of this game as stealthy as possible. The AI in Overture is well coded and respond realistically to noises and light.  There are also no guns or fire arms so your combat mechanics are based around manual weapons such as hammers and pick axes. The combat system is the one aspect that I disliked to begin with; it is very hard to control as you actually have to swipe your mouse in the movement you would like to hit the enemy. It can sometimes get very confusing and you may end up turning your camera 180Â° without wanting to, then getting smacked in the back of the head, which at times can be the difference between life and death.  I found I was able to get to grips with the technique eventually, it just took a lot of actual conscious thinking when I needed to use it. It's certainly not a mechanic I would like to see implemented in other games, at least not in this form. Your main focus when playing is on exploration and classic  adventure game object and item interactions.  Most of the puzzles require searching for keys or other objects which can be placed in another object, such as batteries or motors. All of the puzzles resolution can all be found in the game; there are no wacky puzzles that are really impossible to work out. Clues can be found in books and letters, which again are found all over the game. The game is split into four chapters, each of these chapters has one ""big"" puzzle which may stump you for a while, they normally involve some sort of maneuvering of some kind, for instance my favorite is a steam pump floor and you have to memorize the pattern in which steam is pumped out of the floor, that puzzle alone takes a ton of thinking and memory skills to progress. Graphically, Overture looks like a 2007 game, this is not a bad thing - it's just very dated. At the time this would of been a very good looking game. There are however fan made texture mods which make the game look amazing, and if you are confident in installing these type of mods, I would highly recommend giving it a try. As with most horror games, the music and audio plays a massive role in Penumbra. Like I said at the start, this game has a lot of physiological horror elements. At times there isn't actually anything physically to be scared of, however the music tempo changes and suddenly you start hearing thumping sounds, then all of a sudden you are on the edge of your seat wanting to throw your headset on the floor. Penumbra does the audio side of things brilliantly; in fact if you we to play the game without sound on at all, it wouldn't even be remotely scary. The story mode of Penumbra took me about four hours to complete, which is a solid amount of time for a adventure game like this and I was ultimately happy with the conclusion. Luckily you don't have to pay for each of the games in the series individually, so the price for all three is very well compromised with the length of the game. I didn't have any technical issues with the game either, the game runs at a silky smooth 60 fps, and can be played at full higher resolutions which is always nice to see from older games. If you are a fan of the horror and/or the adventure genre of games, you will certainly find alot of enjoyment in Penumbra. This is certainly a series that I am looking forward to playing the next installments of in the future. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Ah, Frictional Games' first-ever.It's definitely a great horror game for beginning horror lovers. Its atmosphere is dark and menacing, and in general it functions well enough to be both a game and a trip through Hell. It's not too hard, and it's too traumatizing, either. It's a good medium for fun and scares alike.However, this is Frictional Games' weakest game, too. There is only one thing that truly spoils the horror and gameplay in this beauty, and if you don't know this, then it doesn't matter. Otherwise, if you want to enjoy the game without spoiling the feel, don't read the following. This is only a gameplay issue which makes the game trivial if you know it. Again, if you do not know this game and have the slightest idea of playing it, you should not read the following:The main enemy of the game, the undead dogs, aren't truly a threat at all. In all other of Frictional Games' games, monsters cannot be hurt and you are forced to avoid them. However, in this game, the only two monsters -- dogs and spiders -- can be killed. The spiders you are meant to kill; however, you are obviously meant to be stealthy and undetected by the dogs, but the problem is that you can kill them far too easily by simply stun-locking them with melee strikes of a pickaxe or hammer (which, somehow, do the same damage). In addition, they have bad hit detection, and you can sometimes kill them while standing on something just barely above their reach -- even a wall railing you can jump on. When you know how weak the actual horrors are in this game -- even on hard mode -- then all the stealth and threatening atmosphere that was intended for these dogs just becomes a face-mashing party. In my first run through this game, I didn't know the above and I enjoyed the game well. However, after playing it a second time with the above knowledge, I got bored before even getting a quarter into the game because it felt no longer like a horror game.In short:It's a great horror game for beginners if you don't advantage yourself with knowing a few of the game's functional faults. However, if you're already too familiar with such, then you should probably start with another of Frictional Games' better works.			",131,18,3,6,7,2,8

												Would you like to know what was before Amnesia? If yes, Penumbra is for you as you have a chance to see the first survival horror game of Frictional Games.Although not as terrifying, Penumbra Overture is still a relatively scary and interesting game where you pick up the story of Philip who has just arrived to Greenland to find his father based on the mysterious letter he'd received from him. To make it even more interesting: Philip had always thought his father had been dead.The game puts emphasis on physics-based puzzle solving and physics based combat. Combat would be a bit harsh as usually the best thing to do is to run and other than a pickaxe or hammer we will not have any weapons at our disposal. Now, similarly to Amnesia, the protagonist has his own notepad where he writes his thoughts so this is how the story will gradually progress. While somewhat short, Penumbra showed something new in this genre and those who liked the Amnesia games should definitely give this one a try.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Forget Amnesia, this is Frictional Games' underappreciated child that needs more recognition. Compared to Amnesia: The Dark Decent, this game brings more feelings of terror, two-fold the amount Amnesia had on me. In Penumbra, you cannot just run and hide from a situation to make everything okay, in most instances you are faced with a challenge to complete all while being stalked by a demon dog or infected crazies, which can be extrememly overwhelming. The storyline is intruiging, and the visuals are pretty good for a low-budget horror game. The monster AI can be a bit stupid at times, but it doesn't really take away from how terrifying they are. This is a game you will truly find yourself immersed in, and I would recommend it to any horror game fanatic (who doesn't already own it).9/10			",214,28,3,18,12,0,10

												The best horror game I've ever played. Most of these days games rely on jump scares to temporally tug away at the player and is something there for twitch streamers and such. Penumbra will always hold a heart in my place where true horror, scare, and story blend in together.My father, Howard, abandoned me before I was even born. And here I go following his footsteps, but this time, I won't make the same mistakes. That's all I know...If you are going to play this game, avoid killing things. It makes things boring, and attacking is entirely removed in its sequels. Focus on avoiding and running away.I swear, I've never muttered to myself ""I'm so damn lonely"" in a game except this one. Its atmosphere is too great. Never seeing a single human being, only hearing someone, and your character's thoughts (which suspciously relate too much with me. maybe it's an edgy thing with me)You're tucked away at some old abandoned mine with almost no hope to escape and you're not even sure why you're there in the end.

 The most important fact here is Penumbra isn't a Amnesia game!Originally posted by Frictional Games:Penumbra: Overture is a first person survival horror game, emphasizing on survival and problem solving instead of mindless violence and gore. One of the best survival horror games i've ever played...I love the Survival Horror style, but i'm so bad when i play puzzle games,  in Penumbra Overture we have a quite simple  puzzles (Don't worry) . Most of them consist of finding a way into locked rooms  and discovering notes left by former occupants, and using clues left in the notes to make machines work or to put together various paraphernalia to aid in your escape. Remember... You must read the notes, because they are very important to understand the story!I think Overture it's the best of all three games in the Penumbra series, because are so nostalgic when i play it. If you played Amnesia, there is a chance you'll like this game, because Overture is ancestor of The Dark Descent.You play the game from a first person perspective, utilizing the ''WASD'' buttons for movement, and various keyboard keys for additional actions. You can use the mouse for specialized and realistic interaction with objects in the game. Quoting from the manual, âAlmost all interaction in Penumbra behaves in a physically realistic mannerâ¦You grab an object by pressing and holding down (the left mouse button). To let the object go, just release the same button.â (just like Amnesia)Note: Be careful, your game is automatically saved when you reaches checkpoints, or when you click on artifacts (special items). To finish, i really recomend this game if you appreciate a simple game who can give to you a special experience using puzzles and the Survival Horrors mechanisms.			",1992,770,79,192,254,24,290

												By removing the Shooter element from the FPS, 'Penumbra' created an eerie FIRST PERSON SURVIVAL PUZZLE genre that surprisingly features some unexpected, nicely paced, action sequences without any direct combat from time to time. You can actually melee some foes or trap them but you'll most likely just sneak past them in the dark (unless you're being swarmed by spiders). The interface is mostly a point and click plus, where not only you get to combine elements to make your way through doors and passageways in endless halls and corridors, you also get to interact with the environment in 3D (with the occasional frustration of not turning a wheel quite right to open a hatch or not thrusting a rock hard enough to break something). It's indie games like this that paved the way for something like 'Alien Isolation' and it's still today one of the coolest games out there with a great storyline and level design. In some ways I prefer this to 'Amnesia', specially because here the dark is your friend and doesn't drive you mad like in the later game (A mechanic that was introduced in order to force you to use lights as if it was food, to recharge your sanity).

												Penumbra: Overture is a first-person survivor horror game with problem solving puzzles implemented in the gameplay which focuses more on survival and eerie atmosphere rather than action and gore. It is also the first episode of the trilogy.The story centers on Philip, a 30-year old physicist, who gets a strange letter from his supposedly dead father shortly after his mother dies. This gives Philip the inceptive to follow his fatherâs clues, leading him to an abandoned mine in Greenland where he eventually gets trapped in after the mineâs entrance collapses behind him. From then on, Philip ventures through a series of events which turn out creepier with each new discovery he makes. Soon he realises that the mine is not just any ordinary mine. More importantly, it is not actually abandoned. The mine is in fact the habitat of ferocious mutated dogs, ârock wormsâ and spiders. Creepy crawly spiders.Surprisingly, the game has an intriguing story even if its premise of searching for your lost father as a plot device has been done numerous times before. Perhaps that is due to the fact that the story, or maybe its narrative, is actually pretty well-written. Generally, most of the story is being unravelled as the player discovers more lost documents and journals from various people who worked in the mine but died in the end in various circumstances. This may require quite a bit of reading to understand what and why things are happening that way (although some things are still left unanswered by the end), so it is important not to have a short attention span. Additionally, when a particular survivor by name of âRedâ makes his first appearance, things seem to get even more interesting from a plot stand-point, in a way reminiscent of Andrew Ryanâs debut in Bioshock.The gameâs mechanics primarily focus on point and clicking with some ""mouse swinging"" when solving puzzles and small occasions of combat mixed in. Although some puzzles may require a lot of thinking than others, they are by and large well implemented. Unfortunately, there are times when backtracking is required which may or may not become annoying in time. Furthermore, the game does allow you to hide behind objects and block doors to prevent hostile enemies from seeing or approaching you respectively, thus creating a pretty basic but functional stealth mechanic.Penumbra: Overture also boasts a great sound design with its spine-chilling ambient music and close attention to details such as foley sounds, as well as having a memorable soundtrack -- the title soundtrack shall always remain a favourite of mine. Sound design is crucial for horror games like Penumbra: Overture, and it is reassuring to see that the developers did a fine job here.Graphically, while the art direction is commendable, the game did not age too well by todayâs standards. The animations are rough and stiff most of times, particularly for the dogs. But in most parts, the aesthetics do achieve in creating the spooky environment the developers envisioned.The major downside of the game is its combat mechanic. Just like the way you have to approach the doors, drawers or switches in the game, the combat here requires âswingingâ the mouse which is extremely clunky and requires a lot of practice before getting the grips with it. Sadly, the experience generally ends up being always infuriating for every single hit stupidly missed by your pickaxe (arguable the main combat weapon). This is why any combat should be avoided as much as possible in this game, at all costs. On top of that, there seems to be a lack of variation in enemies too.Conclusively, Penumbra: Overture is a game which excels in creating an authentic horror experience with genuine eerie atmosphere and plenty of mystique, along with well thought-out puzzles and an unexpected interesting story, only let down by its combat mechanic and roughness from a technical perspective. Being a relatively short game (so long as you do not âwasteâ time standing in one spot due to fear), it has the perfect length and pace. It may not be the most impressive horror game out there on the surface, but it is one which horror enthusiasts must try thanks to its unique approach and emphasis on atmosphere and less on combat which differentiates itself from the masses of generic and/or action-oriented horror games; in addition to paving the way to future superior, if not the best, horror games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent or even Overture's follow-up episode, Black Plague.

The game offers an immersive horror atmosphere with interesting puzzles and a very strong storyline, which continues straight into the sequel Penumbra: Black Plague.

												The first game by Frictional Games, Penumbra stands as the strong debut of the devs. Although the combat system is clunky, and the mechanics feel a bit unrefined at times, Penumbra is still a great game that contributed to the more polished and sp00ku Amnesia : The Dark Descent. Both Overture and Black Plague are able to hold their own, with plots that are connected, yet both games give off their own distinct feel.

												Penumbra:  Overture ReviewIt's all right.  I wouldn't call it a horror game however, as it's more of an adventure/exploring game with spooky stuff rather than horror.  The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, although you're gonna have to play all three games.  You play as some dude who gets caught up in some mysterious family drama and ends up in an abandoned mine somewhere in the middle of nowhere.  It's been overrun by mutated animals, giant spiders (of course) and worms big enough to rival the Alaskan Bull Worm from Spongebob.As you progress you'll do the typical look-around, combine items, solve situational puzzles, kill a few enemies, etc.  The game basically plays as one big map instead of levels, so unless you know exactly where you're going you're gonna get lost and frustrated.  Certain things won't even activate until you do something else in a completely different area and you won't exactly get a hint.  I used a walkthrough most of the playthrough which helped tremendously, and I didn't feel that it took away from the experience, in fact it was kind of fun for whatever reason to play with the walkthrough.You'll collect notes strewn about that range from diary entries to data logs and such; they give you a sense of what happened in the mine and you'll quickly realize that something went very wrong.  You'll also (after getting a radio) get these messages from a guy named Red who is evidently trapped somwhere in the mine.  He will lead you throughout the game until its end.  I should also mention that this game is rather short.  Don't be fooled by my playtime hours as I've played it across two computers (got halfway and reset).  So I do recommend it, and although it markets itself as a horror game don't expect too much horror, just enjoy the experience casually.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My recommendation: Try it/Get it on sale.Pros and Cons:+ Great atmosphere+ Interesting puzzles- Small variety of enemies- Not as scary as some of the later games from FrictionalYou play as Philip, a 30 year old physics teacher. After his mother's funeral, he receives a letter from his father, who has been presumed dead ever since Philip's birth. In his letter, he asks Philip to destroy certain cryptic documents, but out of curiosity, Philip decides to do some research and finds out the location of a mine in Greenland. He then goes on to investigate the mine on his own, which is where the game begins.Penumbra Overture is a blend of survival horror, psychological horror, and adventure game. You will solve puzzles to progress further, while avoiding and outsmarting enemies. While there is a combat system, the game encourages you to be stealthy and cautions. Combat is pretty clunky and ineffective, mainly because Philip is just a regular guy, not an action hero. Puzzles are interesting and done well, but I did get stuck once or twice (however, I was never good at puzzle games anyway).What makes this game shine is its atmosphere, sense of tension, immersion and isolation. Mysterious story only enhances that, but since this is the first episode in the series, not much is explained. Most of the information comes from notes lying around the place, and you better read them if you want to get the full back-story of the area.In the terms of technical features, the graphics and sounds are solid and do the job, and the physics engine works well. Level design is decent, but since you are in a mine expect to see a lot of similar areas. Voice acting is not the best, but it's not cringe worthy either. Music is pretty good, it really keeps the tension going on and improves the overall atmosphere. Because of the nature of the game the AI is not that complex and that's perfectly fine - enemies patrol the area and if they spot you, they'll chase you.My complaints would be that after some time, enemies started to annoy me and get in my way. Probably because the enemy variety is pretty weak - there are only three different types of them and two of them are encountered only once or twice. Also, I didn't find this game really scary, especially in comparison to some of the later games from Frictional.Overall it's a solid game, worth your time if you're a fan of adventure games with horror elements. It does a good job of setting up the basis for the series.Click here to read my Penumbra: Black Plague review.More reviews on my Tumblr page[megaskylight.tumblr.com] ",218,51,5,29,6,2,28

												Got this pack once when it was on discount on a Steam Sale. Had never heard of these games before so it was a risk buy. However I was reall susprised how difficult it is. You are not given much clues or tutorials and you literally are on your own, thrown into the story. And this is something I really like. It's not dumbed down but the game actually expects you to THINK and use your brain and interact with the environment and the objects you find. It is quite hard but if you like challenges you'll be pleased.  Plus the atmosphere is really good.And the best thing is it is available for LINUX too :D Which is where I play it (haven't checked the Windows version yet).So if you're using Steam OS or playing under a different Linux Distribution, I can absolutelly recommend these games.

												Back to 2006 where I first bought retailed version of Penumbra Collection.Frictional Games started to release one of most intense/psychological horror first person game which become the trend for many FPS type horror. But what does, it's not about jumpscare. Penumbra introduces player with questions and goal of Phillip. Even there's no character development, the most the time each piece of his answer is revealed during playthrough. Overture still left many questions as it's first episode of series.The solid parts of Penumbra are atmosphere and puzzle. Plain map designs but feels uncomfortable and hopeless. The puzzles play as major role of the game. It's fun, creative and encourage player to think outside the box and learn from environment. The combination of point-and-click with real time interaction are well executed. However, when it comes to combat the player don't have much choice beside guarding position and spam your weapon due to clumsy control.Penumbra: Overture is small, interactive fun and left you with some intense moment and storyline.I enjoy everytime I picked it back in action.

												The first episode to Frictional's survival horror franchise that put them on the map.  This series, much like Amnesia, is a true blue example of how horror is done in gaming, only this series gains points of not having an arbitraty sanity meter, but then loses those points for an awful combat system that thankfully, is optional half the time.  The puzzles in the game are a nice relief from fetching â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ly designed slabs of stone to be placed inside indentations in walls and are actually solved through common, real world sense, such as just plain smashing that locked chest open with a rock using the dynamic click and drag world interaction system.  Finally, the story is compelling, and you'd be surprised how much you'll find yourself caring for the only support character you meet, even if he's just a voice over a battered old radio.  If you're a horror fan and are sick of the uneventfulâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥that's passing for horror these days, you owe it to yourself to catch up on this series!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing atmosphere as usual in Frictional games! This game here is iconic for the whole horror-game community because of how early it was made. If you're a fan of horror games and don't mind a bit outdated graphics, this is a must buy just for you to see what horror games were back then. If you want a really scary game from the same developers buy Amnesia: The Dark Descent! For an amazing story, buy S.O.M.A.! But buy this game just to see where it all started... (not really the first horror game but the first Very good one at It's time.) Thanks Frictional Games for still being here making more and more awesome horror games every time..			",76,28,4,5,7,0,10

												Time to completion - 5 hours.Penumbra Overture is an Amnesia-like game (from the makers of Amnesia. It was their first game).  It is a bit different though. The story basically involves your father who had been gone your entire life leaving you a note after his death. This leads you to a location to investigate. The game is a mix of exploration, item colelction, and combat. It is really like on combat, which is good because the combat is the weakest part of the game. You wont be fighting any supernatural crazy things. I wont say more, because I dont want to spoil it. The game is good.Pros: - Great atmosphere and sense of place.- Good level design- None of the puzzles are crazy difficult- Story is interestingCons:-Combat is akward. LIke press mouse button and then ""Swing"" the mouse.- There were one or two places i had to lookup some brief guidance. - Ends on kind of a cliffhanger.			",420,92,12,67,45,5,98

												I consider Penumbra: Overture to be one of the first 'true' horror games I've ever played. It fascinated me by taking an entirely different approach to the subgenre of survival horror, removing nearly all elements of violence or gore, while concentrating on a terrifying atmosphere and environment. Frictional Games manages to create suspense by solely focusing on the feeling of isolation and helplessness in a most hostile environment. Instead of just throwing one jumpscare after another at you, Penumbra plays with the fear of the unknown, and knows exactly at which time to strike. This combined with the puzzles and sophisticated physics engine ensure a perfect pacing between tense and relaxed parts. The music and sound design is remarkably well done for an indie game and can compare to genre classics like Silent Hill without doubt. Penumbra: Overture is a real insiders' tip for me if it comes to survival horror games, and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre.			",152,48,0,16,6,1,10

												Penumbra is a enjoyable experience for gamers who like puzzles and exploration. Dark, Dank, Dissused mines with Vicious dogs roaming around. Spiders, slugs and worms... urgh! It has a great atmosphere about it and areas are small and quick to progress through. Not too much back-tracking. The Combat isn't great but then it can be avoided with stealth. If you must fight, then use your nogging and find a way to make it easier for you and harder for the enemy. plenty of stuff lying around to make combat quicker and less annoying.The story gets alot more interesting the further in you get, So don't give up!Oh! and play this game with Headphones as it adds to the spookiness.

												Penumbra: Overture is arguably a prime example to the tired idea of ""It's not how much time, but it's what you do with it."" Throughout the 4 or so hours I took on this first playthrough, I experienced genuine fear as I crawled through the dusty abandoned mine that would set the stage for most of Philip's first chapter. It's not a stretch to call Penumbra: Overture a terrifying game. More terrifying than Amnesia: The Dark Descent and more on the level of Alien: Isolation, Penumbra: Overture makes you dread turning every corner for fear of a flesh-eating dog or deadly spider. The atmosphere is amplified by the well-told story and excellent sound design (especially the soundtrack). The gameplay is also done really well, aside from the half-baked combat system and few difficult moments (like the first spider cave). I will be coming back to Penmubra: Overture for years, but the atmosphere, story, and sound truly sell the game. It may be 5-6 hours long (maybe more depending on how you play), but it's a well spent time.			",124,18,2,5,3,1,7

												This game was quite the experience - though I would like to say it was an entirely positive experience, Im not quite sure it falls into that category.  I bought Overture as a part of the Penumbra bundle, and have started Black Plague with skepticism.  To sum up my experience with Overture, it would have to be, ""annoying.""  Though the beginning of the game provided an amount of excitement, it quickly became  borderline unbearable to continue due to the ungodly spiders, the redundant puzzles, the giant rock worm debacle and feeble combat/control system.  I honestly had the premonition, ""I will never play this game again."" roughly ten minutes before completing the game; which was all that I had left to carry good old Phillip past the garbage incinerator and into the, admittedly much improved, world of roving, naked 'grey' alien mutations of the Shelter.  My advice is to find a trustworthy rendition of the storyline of Overture, and then begin playing Black Plague.			",118,26,0,27,6,0,7

												Penumbra: Overture is the first game released by Frictional Games, using their proprietary HPL Engine. It's a very dated game, since it was released ten years ago, and you need to keep this is mind if you decide to give it a shot. You'll be exploring an old decaying iron mine which hides some secrets in its depths. The story is interesting but the gameplay falls a bit short after a while, because it gets boring to explore labyrinth-like corridors and to evade the enemies roaming around. The combat is original yet VERY flawed, I never managed to land a single hit with the weapons I found, but an empty oil drum got the work done. That's where the HPL Engine is cool: to whack enemies with whatever stuff you find laying around. The game makes a very clever use of the items you'll be finding around to proceed exploring the mine and the puzzles are fun to solve as well.The graphics aren't anything worth mentioning, other than the excellent dynamic lightning (for 2007 standards) and the atmosphere it manages to set together with the sound effects. I must be getting used to these horror games because I can't say that I was scared at all, but Penumbra can be very unsettling at certain times. Grab it in sale to enjoy how much Frictional has evolved over time. I'll be starting Penumbra Black Plague now and I hope it is as interesting as Overture.			",103,20,2,3,9,0,3

												I've never had so much fun running from dogs~!Seriously though, you should buy this game. For this being the first horror game by Penumbra that I know of, it is really good. The combat is a bit weird, and may screw you over at times, but you aren't suppoed to be fighting the enemies to begin with. My favorite part about this game's combat is definitely how you're supposed to use the weapons, swinging your mouse in the direction that you want to swing the hammer or pickaxe. While there isn't much variety in enemies, just spiders in about two or three places while your main enemy will be the dogs, it is still fun to get past them. Your only companion in this game, Red, has dialogue that is amazing from how it can range from Metaphorgotten to just borderline insanity. Personally, I prefer the Penumbra games over Amnesia and am disappointed that the story to these games is finished, although I can see why.If you're into horror games with a side of puzzle-solving, you should get this game.The main menu music is also simply beautiful in my opinion.

												Having recently played Thief Gold, I was surprised to find more similarities between the two. Philip isn't much of a fighter, but can sneak pretty damn well. The game manages to surround you with an desolate and eerie atmosphere, as you keep descending ever deeper into the complex systems of the underground mine. The puzzles can also offer a good challenge that will leave you satisfied once you crack it down and the documents, scattered about in the mine, are also fun to read to keep up with the story and your surroundings. The engine to interact with your surroundings is pretty unique, as well.    On the other hand, having heard that Penumbra is a massive scare-fest, it was a big letdown. The only semi-real scare you can have is when you meet the first dog and at the very end of the game, which is also quite abrupt and will remind you that Episode 1 is in the game title for a reason. Once you manage to dispose of a few enemies, the horror part really goes down. For most of the time, you are in complete control of the situation, you can work out the patrolling routes of the monsters and ambush them, instead of the opposite. You can also utilize the terrain and various objects to your advantage.    I would recommend Penumbra: Overture as a good atmospheric adventure/puzzle game, but not horror.			",278,133,5,50,28,3,54

												A peaceful start, a few puzzles to learn the ropes... The game is set up.Now imagine that lovely background suddenly turns to an oppressing atmosphere, the anxiosity of walking in every corridor, that sensation of being watched or chased, forced to hide, with no clue what's going despite weird stuff happening all around you...Penumbra isn't cheap scary game made of screamers. It is a true psychological horror puzzle game, just like an interactive Hitchcock movie that would be mixed with science-fiction elements. Simple yet terrifying !Probably one of the best horror game available. I totally recommend getting the trilogy!Overture is my favourite episode : truly oppressing, a better setting and more clever puzzles.Black Plague will lead you deeper into the plot, gathering suspense and revelations. Requiem beautifully concludes the game, and puts an end to this psychological horror tale.			",158,66,12,7,19,4,27

												It has gotten worse graphically, but it is still one of the most atmospherically rich horror games out there. Penumbra might as well be the starting snowball why the horror genre took the indie-scene by storm in the last decade.			",529,261,7,96,60,4,154

This series is most definitively a psychological horror game that runs on its astounding ability to create a bone chilling atmosphere along with a force in the back of your head born out of pure horrific curiosity.Definitely worth checking out if you liked Frictional Games other works.

												This was one of the scariest games I've played, next to F.E.A.R. and some others. Here's my short review:If you love being scared, exploring and solving logical puzzles, then this game is for you. Most of the time, you will be spending your time avoiding monsters unless you have a handy pick-axe with you.The overall atmosphere is very creepy, especially when those dogs are near. The music intensifies when enemies spot you which gives you a rush of adrenaline.The physics are also cool; you can pick things up and move them around.The story just immerses you with all the text you write in your notebook, the short passages during the loading of the next chapter, and the descriptions that you observe when looking at things around you.Overall, it was atmospheric, and scary. It requires you to use your brain and create objects in order to advance. It also gave me chills continuously. Note: To me, you cannot finish this game in one sitting.8.5/10			",1421,492,64,172,165,13,238

												Just finished this game again after all these years; since I first played it... And it's my first game to critic on this blog: Almost forgot how a survival-horror felt! Penumbra: Overture is a stealth-based game with some horror and puzzle elements. The creepy atmosphere's well done with other elements like stealth mechanics and combat system. The game is linear (thanks to god), it sticks with its teasing story, makes you feel like a detective, an escape artist and a very vulnerable person (this last factor distinguishes you from being Bruce Wayne lol).  Game's short critic may be like these:Graphics:        5/10Sounds:          8/10Story:             Nice Atmosphere:   Gives chillsMy Playtime:  Approx. 5 Hours CONCLUSION:The game offered us something new, a unique trial practice and it came out well done. My note for it: 7/10P.S. I'd suggest you to buy these as a pack and please play it according to chronical order like:1. Penumbra: Overture2. Penumbra: Black Plague3. Penumbra: RequiemHave fear and good luck!			",254,25,4,13,8,0,10

												If you like Amnesia, this is the developer's first game and it lays the foundation for what came later. It shows in a lot of ways, but it is by no means a terrible game.For starters, this is the only game Frictional Games has made that feature weapons and combat. This is a good thing, as Overture's combat is clunky and broken. Swinging requires you hold left click, pull to the left or right to prepare a swing, and then swing in the opposite direction to hit. The hit detection is very short-range and the swing area is small. However, the most commonly encountered enemies (dogs) are easy to kill as you can use boxes to stand out of reach of their attacks and simply stun-lock them with your weapon until they die.The atmosphere is creepy, but all of the story is through notes and you never really encounter anybody else. Aside from some rare jump scares, there's nothing terribly scary because the combat AI is so laughably easy to manipulate. There are spiders in this game, which might make you freak out if you have arachnophobia.Luckily, the game is puzzle-oriented and there are only a handful of areas full of enemies. Most of the puzzles are figuring out a process of doing something such as turning on a generator or determining a four-number door lock by translating it through Morse code. The Morse Code puzzle is probably the most difficult out of the bunch and merely requires a pen and paper (or notepad) to write down possible combinations; all other puzzles involve manipulating objects in your environment and following some written instructions.The story ends on a cliffhanger in Overture, so it's recommended you ALSO play Black Plague, which plays much more like Amnesia: The Dark Descent and has much better story presentation. Requiem is technically the third game in the series but is only tangentially related to the other two.So if you're looking for a horror game that involves atmosphere and puzzles rather than focusing on combat like Condemned or Resident Evil, this is a good place to start. It runs on just about anything at a respectable framerate.			",132,66,2,18,5,0,10

												I Dont normally play horror games as I do not get scared by them often.  However, Penumbra: Overture is Different.I thought I would pick this up, just to see what it was like (Also it was Â£1.25 in the Steam Sale). I had no Idea what I was getting myself into....PROS/CONS+A really Tense atmosphere: The atmosphere in the game is spot on. Instead of constant jumpscares the game shoves you into a dark enviroment that will have you jumping at shadows and curling up into a mewling ball in front of your computer.+Sound Design: The sound is immersive and chilling and when you do encounter enemies (Spoiler-dogs) The Nerve-shattering growling will put your hair on end.+Gameplay: You can physically interact with objects and you have to manually open doors by using the mouse button and dragging it around. The puzzles follow the traditional format of itemA+entitiyB=solutionC  and will require you to think logically. You have to manage resources (e.g You have a Flashlight that needs two batteries every hour).+Story: The story is immersive and clever twists and turns will leave you wanting more.+Graphics: Good for a small indie team. -Combat: Unfortunately, this game has a rather clunky combat system. You hold down R and Swing in the general direction of the target with a Pickaxe or Hammer equiped. This is rather annoying in dificult situation as you must stand perfectly still facing the target and if the target is a Mobile, Feral dog the you can expect death. Thankfully, combat is usually never the solution to anything.-Scripted events: The scripted events are annoying as they reqiure you to do certian things in a certian order. For instance, the first spider cave has you crawl through tunnels , blocking off spiders with boulders. You have a limited amount of time to think and what you have to do is unclear without pausing for thought. The worst experience for me was being chased by a Giant Worm through a chemical storage area. You have to close doors with obsucre buttons, bunny hop across a river of Acid, Use the Awful combat system to destroy a fence and finally, knock stupidly placed physics props over to cross yet another Acid River. The cherry on top of this Tarte auâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥was placing a valve next to the exit door only to have it turn very slowly with the solution being unclear (Remeber what I said about time constraints and thinking time). Thankfully these events are Rare in the game.To ConcludeIf you want a very good game that will Scare you and has a great story with nice gameplay and you dont mind the occasional bit of Scripted BS then this is the game for you.

												Penumbra Overture is the first part of Penumbra series, being called Episode One as back then it was planned to make Penumbra a trilogy. Ended up being a duology plus expansion pack. It's a First Person adventure game with horror elements and combat and it was made by Frictional Games in 2007. Yep, same people who made Amnesia, you should feel this one being similar somewhat.Actually, one should note about Penumbra tech demo, which Frictional Games people created to show off their engine. It had similar plot intro as in Penumbra, hero wanting to find answer about his dad in a mine set somewhere in snowy lands, and then you wander around in dark industrial corridors. And then meet a somewhat cute monster who is like a mix of slug and bat. And then solve puzzle. And then in the end get lamely knocked out in a small room covered in blood.And well, it actually excited people enough for developers to consider of making a commerical game based on tech demo. After all, it used physics engine where you was the one dragging things around and being able to manipulate with more detail. Like, you grab a side of valve and then have to circle it around accordingly. And then horror games in First Person weren't widespread back then either.Oh, and people being spooked by the cut enemy.As for how scary this is: Not much. It's not completely realistical and tame, but it doesn't try to screw with your brain with paranormal scares. It just sets of a really dark spooky atmosphere, but once you realize that whatever will be trying to get in your face is just a normal enemy, then well, you will relax. It still can scare you though, in the beggining. I think that game has enough for it going so even those who don't like being scared will feel it's worth playing.And it does feel like a not-high budged episode one of series. It doesn't have much going for it. It's actually repetetive in how it's maze after maze, password after password, note after note. But at least it's still nice to explore and still has lenght of a fine game. Even if it ends on clear cliffhanger. And there are no models for any other human. Even though you will ""meet"" Red. And may like that chap. Who is about as likeable as companion cube.And yea graphics are fine for that time. Does good work with shadows and lighting. Can be muddy. It actually has more than one light source. With one being infinite. Not to mentioning that a lot of areas are well-lit anyway that you don't really have to use them.Yes, it still makes use of that physics engine, which was pretty nice at the time. Though puzzle-solving part of a game feels so disconnect from whatever horror premise. And it's not used as much as one would hope. But hey, it still gives feels. You can feel how heavy the box is when you are dragging it and can't lift it off the ground. Other parts of puzzles makes you combine items like in your everyday adventure game.It also has combat and monsters. Or more exactly - dogs. They usually patrol the main parts of mazes and you find a few tools and items that are used on dogs. They are here to make you sneak and hide around corners of a maze, to make you afraid, with combat system that is clunky. But in short, it gets tedious really fast to go from one point to another point while hiding from them, so I would just murder them. It's actually extremely easy, you can exploit them. Or you can whack them directly and time it so they are pretty much stunlocked. So another flop.But you know, back at 2007 it still was an unique First Person experience. And still is a good fun, even if weaker than the adventure horror games nowdays. Actually, I don't like being scared much, so I enjoyed just having a nice dark atmosphere, exploring and puzzling. Not to mentioning fine music and ambience. And fine pacing at times.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

Penumbra: Oveture is the perfect game in terms of storyline.And that's about it. If you're looking for a ""scary"" game that will leave you shaking, this is not the game (unless you have a phobia towards wolves?) BUT the reason I love this game is because of the storyline. This is where Penumbra: Overture becomes one of my favourite games. You will feel like you're part of the story, you will be immersed and you will finish the game wanting more. I don't care about graphics that much, BUT for a game this old. I will admit that the graphics are pretty good, and you will not have to worry about issues in regards to the age of the game, I managed to get the game working on OS X and Windows without any issues.

												This game does right where all the games that have been trying to copy the Amnesia formula do wrong. Granted that's probably because it's by the same devs who made Amnesia, before they made it, but still. The atmosphere of the abandoned mine is absolutely fantastic, and combined with the music perfectly captures that feeling of being alone, and being watched.The puzzles are nice, you have to actually pay attention and think stuff out, and it doesn't delve into ""just spam every item in my inventory"".Another huge plus for me is the combat. Against more than one enemy you'll easily be overwhelmed, but if you get creative with your approach you stand a fair chance one-on-one, and it's a welcome change from the now-standard ""see monster, hide from monster, wait for monster to leave"" approach horror games tend to use.Finally, the story, or more specifically, the main other character you interact with, is fantastically written, and if you get emotionally invested in your games like I do the twists near the end will hit you like a wrecking ball.

												Whoa, Frictional certainly like their abrupt endings, don't they?  Heh.  However, this one at least has a direct sequel which I'm about to launch into, so perhaps there'll be a satisfying finish to this one yet.     Having now played this in the wake of the also brilliant Amnesia, I have to say...not quite sure why this game's ""spiritual successor"" got so much of the praise, when it's a virtual remake of this in a more ""medieval"" setting?  Sure, Amnesia is perhaps ever so slightly more refined, but it wouldn't exist without this blueprint/""test run"" coming first.  And any game which keeps me in constant suspense with just a handful of feral dogs, some carnivorous fist-sized spiders, and the occasional epic worm is clearly doing SOMETHING right!     In short, if you adored Amnesia you should at least get a kick out of this one, even if you might suffer a slight case of deja vu...and an absolute MUST-HAVE for anyone fascinated with just where the hell The Dark Descent came from.  Underrated!!Verdict: 8.5/10.			",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												Graphics are obviously a bit dated (not by much though) but that didn't stop it from being a very immersive and terrifying game. If you like Amnesia, you will love Penumbra for sure. Amnesia got a lot of its gameplay mechanics from Penumbra. Make sure that you buy the whole Penumbra collection though, not just Overture. Because Overture ends at a HUGE cliffhanger and it feels like an incomplete game without the 2 that come after it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy adventure games and have a penchant for horror, especially from a first person perspective, I urge you to play this. Overture is a testament to Frictional Gamesâ understanding of horror and while it has a few flaws, itâs a spine-tingling experience unlike any other. Just make sure you play it alone with the volume up and the lights down.For my full review visit: http://tap-repeatedly.com/2010/01/review-penumbra-overture/ ",215,53,2,15,16,3,35

												This recommendation applies to both the Overture and Black Plague episodes of Penumbra.Both remind me a little of the survival-horror System Shock atmosphere, crossed with a classic puzzle-solving adventure game.  There are also small homages to Half-Life in the story and gameplay.If you like spooky atmosphere mixed with a bit of action and puzzle solving, you'll really like the first two Penumbra games.Avoid Requiem, however.  It's little more than a Portal-esque rip-off with some horror tidbits thrown in. The only possible reason to bother with the episode is to see the ending, which ties in to the first two and adds an extra layer to the story.  But it's really not worth the price of admission, unless you can pick up Requiem super-cheap.			",438,139,5,28,25,3,27

												I didn't find this game quite as scary as Amnesia, but it is still a good game. The stealth was not done as well as Amnesia, either. Getting around the dogs was surprisingly a piece of cake, only being caught at least 3 times, but you can just hit them, and run away while they go to the other dogs for help, and you'll be all good. The one thing I really hate is the way you attack, having to hold down the mouse button and then move the mouse around. This makes it difficult to stay aiming in the direction you want. If all you had to do was click to swing your weapon, it would make aiming a lot easier. I died a few times because of this problem. I can only hope that Black Plague doesn't have the same thing.And I really hated the part with the chemicals. The labeling of each chemical made no sense, there was nothing giving a hint as to which one was which. I thought the order they were numbered on the paper was the same order as the letters on the vials. I looked through a couple note regarding explosives and chemicals, but they didn't help at all. I had to look up the combination online. I tried to make sense of the labeling of the chemicals, but I just kept seeing people guessing. I still can't find out how it is supposed to make sense, with the numbered order being different than the letter order.But besides that, I still think the game was cool. You should totally play it.

												Really excellent game. The combat is atrocious, but it's totally possible to sneak past any enemies without too much hassle. Great story, terrific immersion, and generally a really quality experience that puts you right in the shoes of the protagonist. Despite any graphical or gameplay issues, I had an undeniably good time playing a game that I really couldn't put down for more than a half hour at a time. Highly recommended, and I'll be moving on to the sequel as soon as I finish this review.			",35,5,0,10,7,0,9

												The first in this silent-hill-esque horror series has some interesting challenges although the enemies seem to be pretty unnecessary since you can just run past most of them (in fact running from them is part of several objectives). Puzzles are pretty straightforward ""find X to open Y and get Z"" and the story is pretty interesting to boot.			",217,103,1,22,12,4,23

												Pretty scary, i'm surprised i got through it, being the wimp that i am. I think it was the atmosphere that scared me, because there's only like 1 or 2 enemies in this game if i remember correctly. The enemies, just 1  furry a-hole in particular, that gave me a hard time, but other than that, the game was a breeze. It has an interesting little story that continues onto the next game, which you will learn more about what was going on through notes n stuff.i played this on my mac, worked pretty well, didn't have problems.This game is worth buying. I got it since it's from the creators of Amnesia(played Amnesia first), and it was on sale, lol. Definitely can see elements from this game in Amensia which is pretty great.

Combat is terrible, though, so do yourself a favour and avoid the more mandatory bits by renaming the dog files in your Penumbra steamapps folder.A little clunky and odd, but completely worth playing, even if just to see how far the makers of Amnesia have come. Has some great sound effects as well as a surprisingly good story.			",175,20,4,23,7,0,19

												I tried playing Amnesia multiple times but was terribly bored and not sacred (though I could never last long enough to get to anything that actually happened I guess). I was afraid that Penumbra: Overture would be similar, but luckily it was not.The graphics are not amazing by any means, but this almost just adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game. In fact, most of the horror elements of the game are just by sheer creep-factor, suspense, and tension alone. The story and atmosphere do most of the work, but they do it pretty well. Combat is a little difficult - weapons are melee-only and swing pretty slowly. Weapons movements are not very fluid, but once you get used to it it's not terrible. Overall, it's worth playing, but know that you have to continue on to the next games in the series to get any sort of conclusion to the story (based on having just finished Overture, apparently the first in the series).One thing though - a lot of the combining inventory items and figuring puzzles out seemed almost impossibly difficult. I don't use walkthroughs very often at all, but I did for the majority of this game, and I have no idea how anyone could get through it without a walkthrough. Maybe I was impatient, but I think I definitely would have simply stopped playing the game if I wasn't 1) brought in by how scary it was and 2) the ability to use a walkthrough - otherwise I definitely would have put the game down and wouldn't have bothered. It's just not the type of game you *want* to spend tons of time on - you just want to play it. Perhaps I should play through Amnesia with a walkthrough...			",102,7,0,17,10,0,16

												So I'm about 8 hours into the game and must say I'm really enjoying it. It is a jump back into time as the game came out in 07, and the method to opening doors is to right click the mouse button while your cursor is over the door and then move your mouse like you were actually opening the door. The story is interesting and I'm hoping it doesn't build up to a terrible ending.  The combat system is weak and repetitive with most enemies I've encountered so far.   Each time you attack one of the dog's it will run away (maybe go howl) then come back and attempt to attack you if you're on the ground. Tip usually I'll get on top of a box and when the dog jumps up swing at them with the hammer. Overall this is a great game and I recommend anyone who was a fan of the Original Resident Evil Series (Before 3/4) or Silent Hill to give this game a shot. I'm wishing I played it sooner.

Amnesia got a lot of its gameplay mechanics from Penumbra. Make sure that you buy the whole Penumbra collection though, not just Overture. Because Overture ends at a HUGE cliffhanger and it feels like an incomplete game without the 2 that come after it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy adventure games and have a penchant for horror, especially from a first person perspective, I urge you to play this. Overture is a testament to Frictional Gamesâ understanding of horror and while it has a few flaws, itâs a spine-tingling experience unlike any other.

												This review contains minor spoilers, mostly of the beginning of the game.Penumbra: Overture is a first person horror adventure game and the first part of the Penumbra series. You play as Philip, a physicist who teaches at university. After his mother's death he receives a letter from his supposedly dead father whom he barely remembers at all. The letter contains a key to a safety deposit box as well as the instruction to destroy everything that's in the deposit box. When Philip opens the box he finds several document and maps, some of which he cannot even decipher. The findings point to a location in Greenland though. So, instead of destroying everything Philip packs his things and leaves to follow the traces his father has left behind. After arriving at the location he manages to find an abandoned-looking mine.Penumbra: Overture plays in first person perspective. The player can manipulate objects by clicking on them and then dragging the mouse accordingly. Doors and drawers are used in the same fashion. This system was later refined and used again in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, so if you have played that one you have a pretty good idea how it works. Many of the puzzles are solved by manipulating objects in the enviroment. It is also possible to pick up various objects and pile them up to briefly block a door or throwing them as a distraction. Philip can also crouch and hide in the darkness - a skill that is very much required. While combat is possible I'd highly advice against it. There are only melee weapons available and those work in the same way as manipulating objects works. You have to actually swing them around using the mouse which is very awkward, difficult and therefore risky. The combat is the one thing I really dislike about the game. Luckily it is avoidable in most cases.While exploring the mines Philip has to mainly rely on stealth and wits. As already said combat is very dangerous and in most cases not worth the risk. Also, there are certain enemies which are so massive that you cannot possibly hurt them in any meaningful way. So for the majority of the time Philip has to lay low, hide if possible and run if necessary. While staying hidden works most of the time there are some parts of the game where you have to get away as fast as possible. This really helps with spicing things up and making the player feel unsafe. Many of the puzzles revolve around manipulating physics objects but there are also some which revolve around finding information and acting accordingly. So you have to example figure out how to assemble an explosive charge, find all necessary ingredients (or substitutes), assemble the device and use it to clear a cave-in, so you can move on. There are several other puzzles which can only be solved by exploring the environment and gathering the appropriate information. Those are very engaging and reward the player with a true sense of accomplishment after figuring out the solution.Penumbra: Overture features a really creepy atmosphere. You are all alone in the abandoned mines with no human being around but still it is obvious that people have been there until very recently. Whenever you apparently get really close to meeting another human being that chance is taken away from you, so for a majority of the time you can only rely on yourself and on the voice of a crazy sounding man who contacts you over the radio from time to time. While he sometimes sounds really nice he seems very unstable and probably not the person you want to rely on when it gets serious. Overall Penumbra: Overture does a very good job in emphasizing Philip being isolated in a hostile environment.Penumbra: Overture is the first half of a two-part game (Penumbra: Requiem is rather a spinoff which does not directly continue the main story). The story continues and reaches its conclusion with Penumbra: Black Plague. Because of that you will not be able to figure out the whole backstory after having played only Penumbra: Overture. There are find several hints to find, though. While I think that Penumbra: Black Plague is even better than Overture, Overture is still a really good game.If you like horror games and/or engaging puzzles this lesser known gem is something you should really try out.More reviews here ",268,35,3,26,16,4,28

Penumbra Overture is a pretty decent horror experience from the developers that eventually created Amnesia: The Dark Descent and SOMA. Follow in the footsteps of your father, who left a mysterious letter that points you to an abandoned mine made into a military bunker deep in icy Greenland. The gameplay is primary about sneaking around monsters, solving puzzles by combining items or using physics, breaking vent covers and breakable wood, and outrunning monsters.  There is very minor combat, but it is largely useless. It is a decent horror experience, but the dated graphics and semi-janky AI of the primary enemies won't scare most gamers nowadays. The game features a man following in the footsteps of his father who left him a mysterious letter from apparently before his birth, telling his son not to follow him. Having limited info about his fathers wherabouts and life, his curiosity got the best of him and he went off to find out what happened to him by going to a mine/military bunker in icy Greenland, pointed out to him in the letter.From there, you play as a fit, but not strong man, exploring a dark, and abandoned mine network solving relatively simple puzzles, sneaking around strange monsters, and out running even stranger monsters. The majority of your inventory use will be light sources (flares, flashlights, glowsticks) and puzzle items and keys, Penumbra hardly has combat, you can find a hammer, pickaxe and broom, but they will be used mostly to deal with easily breakable planks and barrels, and rarely if ever for combat. Attacking enemies never served me well, and I always found myself better off running away and somewhat exploiting the dog AI. Apparently you can kill spiders, but the ""attack"" mechanic is so clunky that its never worth it when it only takes two hits to be killed and the fast enemies are hard to hit. The dog like enemies has funky AI, which sometimes you can run away from if they ""Kind of detect you"" or sometimes detect you from really far away when they haven't before. The same dogs are also fooled by you jumping on a chest high box, and sometimes go away after you run in to a ""steam cage"" in the later portion of the game. (You can probably kill or subdue them here, but it has never worked out for me). You can use beef Jerky to distract them if you stay out of sight, but I found it better to learn their patterns and walk behind them. The gameplay is physics based and ""Mouse-motion control based"", so you have to swing your mouse to attack and drag your mouse to pull levers, twist valves, and open doors. Most players will either hate this for being needlessly cumbersome, or love it for the tension it brings. I found it good tension for opening doors and not knowing what to expect behind the door or when being chased, but was annoying otherwise. Thankfully, most ""inventory puzzles"" work like classic adventure games where you either combine items or place one over something in the environment.You'll eventually recieve communication from a character that has gone mad from living isolated in a small area of the mines for weeks and assists you in your journey. I grew a disdain for this character, as well as the lack of reaction from the PC for the way he treats him. The player character eventually has an opinion of him that I oppose, and I feel many other players will feel the same. To be as spoiler free as possible, the ending was unceremonius, abrupt, and a set up for the sequel. Average play time between me and friends is about 8-9hrs, which is quite fair for one half of a $10 package. You can probably finish it in half that time or less if you know solutions, but expect to play both titles for a full(er) story experience. Penumbra is hardly scary by today's standards, so I only suggest this for adventure game fans or players wanting to play the precursor to the Amnesia series. ",965,265,43,131,97,11,157

												Ever since I played Amnesia for the first time I've become a sucker for good horror games.  Don't confuse that with games like Resident Evil where you can just shoot everything and move forward I never felt that was scary.  If you can fight everything that shows up than its not really that scary.  Amnesia is the first game that I played where you are completely helpless.  Hide or die is the motto.Then I found Penumbra super cheap and got all 3 episodes for little over a dollar.  I been meaning to play it for ages but now I actually am.  Overture is the first episode in the series and while its not as scary as Amnesia yet its still pretty intense.  Yes you can fight but combat is so awkward and clunky you want to avoid more than fight.  Besides most of the monsters are unkillable so fighting them is just to stun so you can escape.  The story is confusing and disturbing.  This ended on quite the cliffhanger and I'm looking forward to continuing the series in Black Plague.			",307,40,4,39,12,3,20

												I don't leave many reviews, usually because I'm too busy playing a game.Like another reviewer mentioned, this game is neither good nor bad.It's interesting.It's not nearly as creepy as many other games (FEAR series, the first Bioshock, etc.)It's worth the price when less than $10.However - considering you will eventually need to kill something (a rabid dog or one of those damn spiders)the combat functionality is just plain bad. It's worse than most games ported from a controller to a keyboard,and incredibly frustrating. This really needs to be fixed.I'll recommend it, but be prepared to die multiple times in a row because you can't get the damn""click - drag right - flick left"" melee to work...grrrrr.

												Yet another Horror Puzzle game at its finest. Grotesque creatures stalk your every move while you figure out which way you need to go, as well as solve any puzzles that are between you and your way out.Frictional games don't disappoint in these games as they will always keep you on your toes, like a midget in a urinal. The only downside that I have seen is the crude combat that exists. Throwing certain objects, using a hammer to strike them, or just simply sitting on top of a crate where they can't hit you but you can hit them kind of takes away the helpless feeling that Amnesia has. However, the sequel to Overture pretty much elminiated this making Black Plague an improvement.Overture is Part 1 of the Penumbra trilogy, and I also recommend playing the others as well (Black Plague and Requiem).9/10			",203,58,0,17,14,1,16

												Well Penumbra Overture Iam so happy to add this game to my horror collection it is among the most unique and satisfying horror game of all time the atmosphere is nothing short of brilliant and will have you squirming in your chair the whole play through. The game play is very unique and similair to Amnesia which by the way is one of my favorite horror games as well but penumbra takes a different approach when it comes to horror and builds the terror as you play with each moment and every solved puzzle bringing you further into the madness that is penumbra. 10 out of 10 a must have for horror fans.

												Deep in the uncharted planes of northern Greenland lays an abandoned mine. You start out the game as Phillip, a physicist who got a mysterious letter from his father who has been dead for 30 years. In the letter are coordinates to an abandoned mine, so you decided to go check out what your father has been trying to hide since his death. Upon arrival, you find yourself alone, scared, and  defenceless . As you explore the mine, you decend deeper and deeper into the bowels of the Earth. Along the way, you slowly start losing grip on what is and isn't reality. I would give  Penumbra Overture  an 8/10. This game has a really great atmosphere and setting. The main down side to this game is that it can be a bit buggy from time to time, but 90% of the time it runs perfectly.			",103,14,0,10,6,0,8

Ashamed of my coward self I launched the game once again and let my manly self be engulfed by the darkness.The greatest compliment you can pay to a horror game is refusing to play it because you are too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing scared to do it.

												Penumbra is a horror/adventure series by Frictional Games, the developers of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece, there is still a lot to enjoy in Penumbra. In fact, it's very easy to see how Amnesia eventually came to be what it is - its elements are on full display here, albeit in early forms. While the games do have some scary bits, overall the fright-factor is not quite where it could be. This is mainly due to the somewhat dated graphics and easily thwarted enemies (which, unlike in Amnesia, can usually be killed). The puzzles are generally pretty decent, with only a few solutions being particularly obtuse. So, while not perfect, the series is still worth a look for horror/adventure game fans, especially those who enjoyed Amnesia and are interested in seeing the roots of that game and supporting its developers.Penumbra: Overture is the 1st game in the series. It's decent, but has some rough edges and doesn't quite come together fully.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												The game largely forces you to do combat with dogs and spiders, a generally unscary but annoying experience given the horrible combat controls. Avoiding them was suggested, but enemies are not anywhere near scary enough to warrant hiding. Amnesia's Grunts and Brutes always warrented hiding, a big difference.Small amounts of steam coming from pipes should never be used as an environmental killer. It feels wimpy to die to it.The puzzles are too short and easy. Honestly the game feels like a chore.Going to give Black Plague a shot after this. Currently considering Overture as Frictional's warmup attempt at a comercial horror game.Amnesia was stellar though.			",46,15,0,1,6,0,3

												Solid horror experience. I definitely suggest this to anyone new to the horror corner of gaming, while it certainly has its share of scary moments, they aren't heart attack inducing like Outlast or Amnesia. It has quite a few gameplay faults, that when known, will greatly lessen the scare factor, so try to avoid let's plays before you've actually beaten the game. Another thing worth note is that this game DOES NOT hold your hand, at all. There are quite a few headache-inducing puzzles that will ruin your sanity until you've figured them out.Definitely give this one a try, especially at such a cheap price.			",37,6,0,4,2,0,0

												The original Puzzle Horror game from Frictional games, Penumbra: Overture is the start of a trilogy to remember.  I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent first (having learned of it through youtube hype back when it was first released), and then when I found myself craving more and searching on Frictional's website, I came across this gem.  There is a free demo of this game available from said website, and I recommend playing that if you want a taste of the game before you buy.  It is very much like Amnesia TDD, although in a slightly brighter yet just as grim underground mine.  The atmosphere is eerie, and the story is captivating and can really make you emotional at points (it did for me, anyway).  I definitely recommend this to those who want horror games that play like Amnesia: TDD.  Or, for those who are just discovering Frictional's work, Penumbra:Overture is a wonderful place to start.

												I often play horror games with my friends, not because I'm afraid to play alone but because it's more fun to share  that creepy atmosphere at home while playing the game or just watch my friend freak out when a jumpscare pops up.So after an hour of playing the game with my friends , I turned it off. We got bored of it and went to watch a movie instead. After about 3 weeks later I decided to try this game alone, give it another go. I started from the begining and this time I got hooked. The atmosphere that this game gives is really good. You start fearing that some creature is waiting for you behind every door and after entering a room you barricade the entrance just because you feel safer. In some games it's more beneficial to just reload a save because you wasted some items needlesly or just lost some health points but in this game I felt happy because I was stopped being chased by monster. I didn't care that I lost half of my health and wasted items needlesly, I was just glad I was safe at that point. The puzzles of the game are alright but some of them make no sense. I had to look at a walkthrough for one of the puzzles which is a bad thing because it just destroyed the immersion I had. About the puzzle I was stuck on >  Ther's a locked door with a key that's inside from the other side. What I had to do is push the key out and manage to get it back somehome. The door is clearly touching the floor so there's no way of getting the key from under it. Turns out you have to put a newspaper under the door, push the key out, the key falls on the newspaper, you pull the newspaper and collect the key. But how could the key fit if there wasn't a gap between the door and the floor???  If you're looking for a horror game to play, then you should give this game a try.			",148,34,2,17,13,1,5

												The original Puzzle Horror game from Frictional games, Penumbra: Overture is the start of a trilogy to remember.  I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent first (having learned of it through youtube hype back when it was first released), and then when I found myself craving more and searching on Frictional's website, I came across this gem.  There is a free demo of this game available from said website, and I recommend playing that if you want a taste of the game before you buy.  It is very much like Amnesia TDD, although in a slightly brighter yet just as grim underground mine.  The atmosphere is eerie, and the story is captivating and can really make you emotional at points (it did for me, anyway).  I definitely recommend this to those who want horror games that play like Amnesia: TDD.  Or, for those who are just discovering Frictional's work, Penumbra:Overture is a wonderful place to start.

												In the late 90's I published a Call of Cthulhu RPG scenario on Cthonian that resides near a coal mine somewhere in Eastern Europe, so this game has been pretty much a deja vu for me. Unfortunately, the game itself does not stand the test of time. Graphics is crude. Plot is decent, but nothing more. It is full of Lovecraftian cliches. The characters (character) you meet  being affected, implausible. The worst part of the game, however, is physics and controls. Interactions with environment tend to be clumsy, using equipment is very unhandy. How big is the problem? Well, I tend to avoid all creatures not because I was afraid of them (as it should be in horror games), but because I struggle to omit any fight possible. To simply hit an opponent with a pickaxe was a challenge requiring very high skills with mouse and keyboard. At the same time the enemies are plain stupid (attacking until dead in a repetitive manner) and happen to die in weird positions - dogs drop dead 2 ft above ground, or partly in the wall or in the ground. Again, it's a glitch, not a horror element.All in all, not recommended (says a Lovecraft fan). I had to force myself to finish the game.			",86,121,0,20,12,2,41

												Ok, after so many years I was finally able to play the whole chapter. I am very sensitive to horror games....I was never able to go past the first levelm, I tried many times and I always stopped. Once I got used to the 'fear' system of the game, the game stopped being too scary for me and I started enjoying instead of seeing it as a torture (this is a message to the chicken people like me who are scared by such games).Anyway, the game is cool enough. First of all, keep in mind that this is a Chapter. The game has no end, it is a cliffhanger ending so if you are one of those (like me) that hate unfinished things, keep in mind that even if you don't like the game so much, you will have to play all three chapters (overture, black plague, requiem) to see the end of the story.This chapter is quite short (6 hours are enough). Puzzles are nice, physics serve well that purpose. Graphically it is pleasant. Sounds is also still good enough for today's standards and controls are interesting. Can't say about the story because I have to play 2nd and 3rd chapter yet, but what can I say....so far so good !  75/100			",301,119,14,7,7,1,10

												The game ends in a cliffhanger. It is very clear that this is episode one, as it is stated both in the menu and by the main character in the end. Still, it's a very good game and I'd say it almost works as a 7-hour length demo of the Penumbra: Black Plague.The story of a man seeking for his father in some vast and deserted area with mutants has been seen often before, but I think that Penumbra's story isn't concentrated on the things you hear from the main character, but instead hidden inside the articles and letters you find throughout the game.I don't have a lot of time to analyze the awesome athmosphere or the great ending this game has, but I can say that this is a very considerable purchase. I haven't played Amnesia (yet), and this is a very good introduction to the Frictional Games' view of physics and story.I recommend this title.			",46,16,1,5,9,0,6

												This is the first of a trilogy made by the makers of Amnesia, so if you've played Amnesia then you will find pretty much a lot of similarities from that franchise in these games in a more modern day scenario (amnesia was set in the middle ages, this is modern, so instead of a lantern with oil, you have a flashlight with batteries, although you also have a glowstick with unlimited power, but obviously not as powerful as the flashlight) with a somewhat interesting (and honestly confusing) storyline. If you're looking for a single player game that is cheap and will have you thinking to solve puzzles and that you'll play around 10 hours on (in each game) I recommend the Penumbra trilogy!

												I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys horror games or are fans of the Amnesia game(s). Penumbra will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through (Unless you get stuck on a puzzle area) other then that the game is very fun and for the price of ten dollars its a great deal and it even comes with the sequel. Penumbra: Black Plague which is also very fun!			",45,4,0,5,4,0,1

												I finished this game some time ago I think late 2013. Yes it took me 6 years to finally play this and when I did I was so glad I played it, this is the precursor to Amnesia: The Dark Descent and it's really nice to go back and see the evolution of Frictional's horror games and how they did so well with Amneisa. Anyways this game is really good while it is not amazing in terms of horror it really stands on it's own. There are no incredible grotesque monsters to hide from and the creatures you do encounter can be dispatched with weapons found, the puzzles are incredibly simple and the atmosphere does well to put you on edge.Overall I think this game is deserving of the attention of all horror fans and I highly recommend you play the others in the series too.

												I have not played this game, because it is scary, and scary things scare me, but I feel confident in writing a recommendation because I've checked out a couple screenshots and listened to Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" a couple times (this game has ""overture"" in its name).Basically this is a game about, you know, dark things in a place, and you do stuff, and I think monsters attack you? But it's also psychological horror, like, when you have just pooped and then you realize you might be out of toilet paper and it's the feeling you get before you turn to check if you do or do not have toilet paper. That kind of horror. Or the kind of horror that you get when you realize that you're going to be a parent. Or cancer.Also this game has physics in it, which is important because physics is science and science is the future and children are the future. This is a good game for children. To teach them physics.I give this game an 8 out of 10 Draculas (vampires are also scary).			",218,98,3,24,13,1,35

												Penumbra Overture is an excellent survival horror game with a unique physics-based system that isn't very common in the survival horror genre. Sometimes frustrating because of the occasionally confusing puzzles, but overall frightening because of the tension that stems from a combination of dark atmosphere and being pursued by creepy enemies (mostly animals in this game). Not quite as good as its sequel, Penumbra Black Plague, but still a great game on its own (and much better than the third game in the series, Penumbra Requiem). Best when being played late at night, while using headphones or ear buds!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a horror game made by the company Frictional Games (same ones who made anmesia).This game is scary at some parts and really makes you tense such as when theres a monster coming around a cornor and you have to hide quick.Its not the best horror game around but it's worth the look.The graphics in this game arn't the best but are not bad though it quite an old game released in 2007 so it will not have the best graphics out, it dosn't run particualy well on low power machines, but runs fine on medium to high power machines I have a 650 and I can have it on max setting with around 50-60fps which is to be expected on more powerful machines.The story is quite vague but does hold some element to it.So I do reccomend this game if your looking for a horror title.

Penumbra Overture, the prologue of the series, sets the atmosphere for its sequel, as you are put in Philip LaFresque's boots who decides to take a trip to the desolate northern Greenland, after receiving a post-mortem letter from his father. As expected, this experience will turn into a nightmare for Philip as he will find out more than he would have ever wanted or imagined.The game has a nice pacing as it progressively introduces you to new elements in its story and gameplay, making it an enjoying and not time-consuming horror survival experience. We can also notice this early Frictional Games' passion for creating a good story, riddled with a deep psychological theme (even more noticeable on its sequel).A true classic of the first person horror survival games.

												the overture is the first game in penumbra series and its also first game by frictional games and you can see its their first gamestory-you go into the mine where you trying to find something that leads to youre characters father because he probably did some research and something screwed up,and then he dissapeard (i guess)along the way you encounter youre only enemy in this game........Dogs.......zombie dogs.yeah and then there is a giant worm but he wont chase you throghout a whole game so whats the pointbut lets talk about zombie dogs.who the hell thought they will be good enemies?!if you kill them they respawn but even with that theyre not good enemies.youre always quicker so you can lose them and if you will see dead end ahead of you,well dont worry just throw stuff at them they will stop.God even spiders youll meet are more terrifying.thats not the games only flaw.youll might love the envoirment of the mine but me...wellim sorry but it was quite boring envoirment,it felt all the time same for mewith that what i said you might think i hate the game  but actualy i think its quite decent.puzzles are decent and made me think for a while and even though i said that enemies sucks,atmosphere is really great and it actually feels like a horrorthe story isnt the best but also not the worstto sum up the game is decent but ill rather reccommend playing second one because i think that second one is betterbut if you want to know what happened in the begining go ahead and play it.its quite short so even if wouldnt like it you can end it in less then 3 hours not bad start for frictional games6,5/10			",108,17,0,8,3,1,6

												The atmosphere in Penumbra: Overture is great. It's dark, creepy, lonely, and cold. The physics engine is okay, with some flaws here and there, but nothing worth seriously complaining about. The moving of objects and melee actions can take getting used to, but once you're comfortable with the physics engine, it works okay, although far from perfectly. The game flows through the story smoothly without any frustration or senseless puzzles/problems to be solved. Everything is logical and upfront, requiring a realistic approach and a reasonable amount of thinking to proceed. The save system is unfriendly. It seems to save your progress when you update your personal notes, or when you interact with a certain object within the game world, which the player has little control over when this occurs. This means that you will often have to do certain portions of the game over and over until you get it right. The voice acting is superb. The accent and tone are outstanding and adds to the storyline greatly. All of the texts you will encounter in the game are well written, interesting, and adds plenty to the plot. The controls can be awkward at times in order to accomplish some actions the game requires. Penumbra: Overture is not a scary horror game. Most of its interesting emotional influences on the player comes from the theme of being almost completely solitary in an unknown place that is far from civilization and darkness. There are some instances in the game that requires the rapid change of items in conjunction to platforming and running, which I had to do many times to get it right. There is also a surprising amount of platforming as a whole for a primarily adventure game. Some parts of Penumbra: Overture are really cool, there is no denying that, but it does have a feel of an unpolished low budget title. With that said, this is probably one of the best adventure games I have ever played. It is logical and tense at all the right moments. I am not entirely sure for how long the main character is inside the mine, but the glow stick lasts for the entire duration of the game. You are not forced nor expected to use the flashlight nor the flares, which have finite longevity. I found melee fighting to be clunky and awkward, but this did not detract from the overall gaming experience. The ending is very creepy and will keep you glued to the plot, even though there is much left without explanations. The only major downside is the game's length. It is somewhat short and leaves you with a feeling of unfinished business with a cliffhanger.Penumbra: Overture is good.			",1296,339,61,143,147,16,197

												This game will make you crap your pants. It was made by Frictional Games which is the same company that later went on to make Amnesia. There's small, hard-to-hit spiders in the game and they will mess you UP. There's also dog/wolf things scattered throughout the whole game but once you figure out how to kill them, they'll be a breeze to run through.

												Penumbra: Overture is a first-person game about Phillip (the player) who ventures into an abandoned mine in search of his father. The game takes a dark turn when Phillip is trapped and forced to survive the horror of the mines while looking for clues.Overture is only slightly scary in my opinion, but that's just fine. It's more about survival, and is incredibly realistic. What it lacks in scariness, it makes up for in realism.For example, the main enemy is packs of demonic dogs that stalk the player. You can fight them, but it's hard. You aren't a superhero, and you can't just click to swing your instrument of destruction over and over. You have to time attacks carefully, and swish the mouse in the direction you want your weapon to swing. Another example is the physics engine. Like Amnesia, you can pick up/throw/push almost anything by cicking on it and dragging the mouse in the corresponding directon. You feel like you're really there, like your character has wieght and realness. This makes the game totally immersive, and really heightens the ""survival"" aspect.You'll have to solve puzzles and escape monsters all the way through while feeling helpless and alone--so it perfectly captures what the survival horror genre is about. The mad rantings of your only friend, Red, wrap it all up. Red is wonderfully voice acted and his insanity is creepy, eerily setting the mood.  If you want a dark, macabre, realistic, true survival horror game that doesn't pull punches or hold your hand, Penumbra: Overture is it. 10/10.			",67,21,0,24,2,0,15

												Play Amnesia instead.This game plays exactly like what it is: Frictional Games' first shot at a full video game. The horror, atmosphere, and story elements are as good as always, but there are additions to the game that just make it worse.1) The AI is terrible.2) Being able to attack/defeat the monsters takes away from the horror.Their later games keep all of the good parts of this game and remove all of the bad.

												Short Review Incoming:PENUMBRA OVERTURE the first installment of the Penumbra series is a good horror game. The atmosphere is amazing and really eerie. This and the sound-design is what makes this game for me. It's creepy without any kind of disturbing imagery or jumpscares. On the other hand: The gameplay is rottenâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ The puzzles are not really well thought through and most of the time you have no clue what to do. And the combat... OH boy the combat. It's dreadful. Hit detection seems like it's non exsistent in this game. It isn't really fun to play.I would say skip Overture, read a plot summary and start with black plague which is a much better game!			",186,28,1,27,8,2,14

												Okay, so the best thing about this paranormal/survival horror game is the one thing many games out there don't have and which is my biggest peeve: ENVIRONMENTALLY INTERACTIVE. Yes, Finally, a game designer had a brain. I hate when there are things in the room and they are just made to look pretty and not be messed with, like part of the building's structure. If you see a book, you can pick it up. If you see a mattress, you can toss it, use it for a puzzle, launch it over a cliff. Glass can be broken. Hell, throw a barrel at your enemy and watch him stumble. How control how you pick it up and where you want it to go, Go play jenga with barrels and bags of garbage. XDAs for that, the rest of the game is very enjoyable in a very dark and strange way. The lighting, the atmosphere, the game dynamics. Very nice. Never had an issue with the game, including gameplay, puzzles, exploring. The game's sequel Black Plague is also just as enjoying, but not so much as the expansion Requiem.I highly recommend this game. NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first of the Penumbra Series.I was an avid fan of Amnesia: the Dark Descent, and wanted to try another Frictional Games piece. This game is somewhat disappointing. Without giving away too much of the story:- There is only one or two types of enemies during the entirety of the game, making their patterns highly predictable and once you find a way to exploit their terrible AI, they fail to present any challenges. -  The story is written as if an edgy teen indie team created it. The story must be intentionally vague, as (SPOILERS) the ending literally finishes with ""to be continued."" As a player, you never actually know what's going on. Sure, you know where you are and that you want to escape and how you got to where you are: the basics. The more you play, however, the more unanswered questions you end up with.- I want to give this piece the benefit of the doubt and consider the entire series in my review; perhaps the second and third games answer all of these questions and creates a fantastically crafted story. Unfortunately, the first game alone does not produce that faith in me.Although the game is an older ""classic,"" the story and mechanics are ridiculously simple, repetitive, and ultimately boring. Perhaps after the other games, I will feel better about the series, but this game is not worth playing alone.--EDIT--The remainder of this review is after I have completed the second game - Black PlagueI will reserve my criticism for that specific review, but because the sequel answers many questions and is a good game, Overture is a necessary evil for the means of continuity in the series.Long story short, Black Plague is far better than this game, but you should play this too for the best effect.

												Just finished it and I gotta say this is one good horror survival game. Though it's now more than 7 years old, it's not bad looking. Not pretty but good. The controls take a little time to get used to but they're not awkward. The atmosphere of the game is just awesome. The music though there's very little of it also helps to create the feeling of tension. The story is mostly told by notes you'll find but it keeps you interested. The only bad points I could say are some annoying parts where you're chased and need to find your way before getting killed. They can become frustrating......damn spiders! Also sometime the cursor won't appear yet you need to click on an item to do something. It will work if you click but if someone waited for the Icon before clicking they could miss something. These are minor things that should not keep you away from this great experience.My advice is to save often with the strange artifact (glowing orange lights on it) or you can rely on autosaves.Get the Collectors Pack which has this game, the second part (Black Plague) and it's expansion so when you finish one you can jump straight in the next part. Really worth every penny. ",114,39,1,56,7,0,9

												The game fell short at the end (figuratively and litterally; you can beat the game in 8 hours). You won't miss much if you just read a summary of the story on the internet. The game really sets a good scary atmosphere though, but it never gets as scary as I hoped it would be. The dogs and the spiders justâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥me off more than they scare me, especially when I realised you could kill them. I know black plague has creepy naked dudes so hopefully it will creep me out a little more.			",78,14,1,10,8,0,2

												Games and stories have really come a far way since this. If you want to see where horror in gaming has come then play this. Even though when the game came out there were already better options, the controls are bad the graphics are ok, the sound is ok, the overall story is fine but very limited. They could've gone deeper into the game lore. I haven't played the next game yet but hopefully that brings about a much more detailed story to keep me involved.			",240,62,16,38,15,2,27

												I know this now comes as a pack and can't be bought seperately so to not play it would be wasteful, but in my honest opinion Black Plague is far better and this doesn't have much worth in playing except for experiencing the lead up to how the second game starts.This is because after only maybe an hour in everything becomes quite repetitive while nothing much happens story-wise either except for three short excursions that were fairly interesting but buried within the repetition. *edit* [Hardly a spoiler/Not a story spoiler]:After the encounter with the first monster, they become annoyances that are tiring to deal with. If you're looking for the adrenaline rush of scary encounters, you'll get maybe two out of this. Also, for the most part, what happens in the story in this game is explained in the second game. What you do get is more insight on a particular character and of course more notes to read. The ending felt quite underwhelming.What I will say that I enjoyed more in this game is that the notes you find are much more helpful (and usually necesssary) to your progression compared to Black Plague which means there's less of a feeling of ""I have these useless notes that I could read but I'm not that interested in"". However, the puzzles are also sometimes just a matter of wandering around which detracts from them.To conclude I wouldn't say you should definitely avoid this game, but that it provides a lot less than Black Plague does in almost every aspect. I feel that skipping this game improves the quality:hour ratio and you don't miss a lot by doing so. If you do decide to skip it and then feel interested in coming back to it, by all means. There are a few sections that are worth playing.			",119,21,1,10,8,1,19

												Penumbra series are quite good games in general.  THey are a bit old but the story and adventure part of it is done quite well and is engrossing to a degree.The puzzles and quest are quite well done though a little illogical at times and can be monotonous, but overall they get you thinking.  The horror side is mehhhhh!  The game is predominantly in the dark and the creatures are from a B grade horror from the 50's but it does set the mood at times, especially with the audio effects etc.The graphics are very ordinary compared to modern capabilities but for the time they were okay.  The AI of the dogs etc is appalling and quite comical but again its primarily due to the era of the game.The part that kills al these penumbra games is the controls.  Its beyond bad.  They tried to be clever and realistic by making the use grab item and swing in an arc to open boxes and doors, or try to line up items using the mouse but overall kill the game.  You cant actually line any thing up so when trying to smash one of these crazy wandering brain dead dogs you end up doing the cha cha and relying on pot luck. Luckily as stated the AI is near non existant so simply get on a box etc and just swing and mash buttons and eventually the job will get done.Its a pity really because I was getting into the game itself but it just gets frustrating and unplayable.It would be great if they ever revamped the series as it has the making of a good game, but unfortunately I think this game is long forgotten.If u can pick it up cheap and have the patience of a saint when coming to control etc then I'd say you could do a lot worse.If its a action adventure your looking for then give this a wide birth!Steam should put a star system as I'd give this game 2 to 2 and half stars out of 5, but can not recommend for most people.

												Control method sucks. In this game you don't hold objects they kind of hover below your hand. After about 30 minutes of trying to open that fecking hatch in the snow I gave up out of frustration as the rock kept dropping willy nilly and I was not able to control its height or position with any accuracy. Why do developers have to mess with tried and true control methods i.e. grab something and securly carry it until needed. Oh and make use of the laws of physics and allow you to throw or drop an item with at least a little accuracy. Just....frustrating.			",40,13,0,9,3,0,1

												Penumbra Overrated. The atmosphere is great, the puzzles are ok and the enemies, plot, and stealth elements fall flat. This is not a spooky game. The atmosphere builds it up to be, but disappointing enemies and trial and error game play takes all that away. Your enemies are guard dogs & spiders, and very rarely a big worm thing, that's it. Some supernatural or especially fierce enemies could have added a lot of tension, but nope, just doggies. If you were dropped in the middle of the game with no explanation you would probably guess you were playing a poor wolfenstein clone.Certain parts of the game are only possible to complete by reading a walkthrough ahead of time or by dying over and over until you determine the correct sequence of events (especially the rockworm at the end). This repeated trial and error type game play replaces any feelings of suspense with ones of frustration.The plot starts off strong and mysterious, falls a bit flat in the middle and leaves with a confusing ending. This game had potential but at the end I was glad I had finished it just so that i can say i beat it and don't have to touch it again.			",180,67,18,46,37,1,47

												I like this game's approach; Physics based puzzles, emphasis on atmosphere and story instead of violence. But once you know the type of enemies (hounds and spiders) you will encounter, the game is starting to lose its spookiness. When I discovered the clunkiness and the poor AI of the hounds I lost all interest, major game breaking element for me. You can stand on top of a barrel or crate and the hounds are unable to get you. Skip this title and try other entries in the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing a couple of hours I would say this is definitely a good game. It was my first time in a horror/thriller-puzzle based game and though the graphics and physics were sometimes buggy, I had a good fun. Sometimes the story get lost within itself, with a lot of uninteresting long texts and notes but it doesn't really matter afterall; because what matters is the atmosphere the game creates. Better played at night, in a air-conditioned darkened room, in a 32-40'' TV. Manage to buy the 'trilogy'.			",5,1,0,0,1,0,0

												OH HAI WE HAVE A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE 2007 UI, LET'S MAKE ALL OF OUR PUZZLES EXTREMELY COMPLICATED!!!!!!!!NONE of the puzzles make any sense. Every single different one I have had to use a walktrhough BECAUSE the interactions with items are NOT PREDICTABLE AT ALL. Sometimes you can pick up shovels, but in the next level you cannot. Why? I don't know, probably because the makers of this game wanted to make all the puzzles complex, but had to save space. I do not recommend this game for anyone who does not enjoy having to use walkthroughs and tear out their hair trying to figure out â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ levels. I've been stuck on a level for THREE WEEKS. This is absolutely ridiculous. Don't make your puzzles so complex and elaborate IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FORM OF STABILITY IN THE INTERACTIONS WITH YOUR ITEMS, JESUS CHRIST.			",43,4,0,5,7,0,2

												Terrible game, your stuck in a mineshaft solving physic based puzzles. Only thing is the puzzles make no sense so you have to backtrack trying to figure out what you need or have to do. For example, there is a puzzle where you need to hang a broken ladder on this hanger where the lights are suppose to be. so i ignore the fact that a ladder goes on a hook the lights. But here is the thing the broken ladder is in two seperate pieces. and i got one of the pieces up already, so the logical thing for me to do is to try and piece together the other part of the ladder to reach the ground where im at. After spending about 20-30 min flinging this extra piece of metal around, trying every angle to get it to connect like a tetris piece, i give up and search online for help. Come to find out, I only need one piece of the ladder and i have to stack â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boxes to reach it.  Well holy crap, of course!! what was i thinking!? why would anyone try and put together a ladder when they could stack â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boxes.   Another time i have a rock roll and chase me, I somehow reach the end, only for the game to autosave upon my death at the end of the tunnle. So everytime i load, i die. So i load a previous save, i get past the boulder and dodge it, this time it autosaves when spider hatches  and i have to dig my way out. Again i die over and over, so i reload from previous save again. Come to find out, i have to destroy wood, that make boulder fall into a hole, run past spiders, and block parts of cave with rocks you move, showing off physic puzzle. At a certain point it become dumb, because the puzzles are not logically thought out. And you have to complete a checklist of a certain way to get past an encounter, which is fine....but don't make the next scenario impossible if i somehow get past it by not following your checklist, making me reload after multiple attempts of me thinking i did it the right way, only to find out it is impossible to continue beacuse i didn't do it their way.

												This is one of those cases where Steam needs a ""Maybe"" button, but since binary is the only option (and my experience of the game is bent slightly towards the negative) i'll have to go with ""No"" and then proceed to explain why.You play as some dude trapped in a mine underneath the freezing cold of Greenland. The gameplay is pretty straightforward: You arrive to an ""area"" of the mine, which consists of a few rooms connected by halls patrolled by monsters. You can see the map of the area in numerous locations in the halls (some are almost next to each other... was it so hard to have the protagonist carry the map around and view it with a simple button?). You visit the rooms, find clues, closed doors, broken machines, etc. and must then proceed to solve these puzzles in order to progress to the next area. You cannot visit previous areas nor move on until you completely clear the current one.You get some makeshift weapons, though you're not supposed to use them and instead sneak by the enemies by crouching and moving carefully in the darkness (BOOORING! it was slightly exciting the first time but seriously, there's some parts which you must navigate back and forth, and having to sneak carefully EVERY SINGLE TIME? c'mon), though i ended up developing a strategy to kill all the monsters so i could then move freely aboutWhat i disliked the most was the story to game length ratio. The whole plot is summarised in two sentences at the beginning of the next game, and it really feels overstretched at some points (a lot of times i was like ""ugh, can something happen please? i'm just here solving all these puzzles and nothing happens story-wise"")Audio, video and ambience are OK, but definitely not scary (and i always played with headphones and at night with all lights off). I really hope they didn't intend the locations to be frightening or disturbing, because if they did they fell very short of it.Finally the puzzles can be divided in two categories: traditional and physics-based. Traditional puzzles are like ""this machine is broken, find the parts, place them in the correct spots and start the machine with a specific sequence of steps ambiguously described in this text"" and they always feel too easy. Physics-based puzzles are like ""an electric fence is blocking the way"" and you must move things around (boxes, planks) to get through. Now i don't have anything against pysics-based puzzles, but most of the time there's no indication whatsoever that you're facing one of these, so you can spend some time wandering around an entire area until you realise that in the room in the complete opposite side of the mine has some stuff that MIGHT be the physics puzzle that you need to move on.tl;dr more annoying than innovative, and definitely not scary at all.

												I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a horror game after a couple hours with it. The game has its moments of horror, but they only slightly stretch passed the initial reactions to it. The beginning does a good job of keeping you in the dark in terms of story and atmosphere. There's a sense of confusion and loss that doesn't leave; however, this eventually turns to a sense of confusion based upon the lackluster combat and wonderment of why you should be scared. The enemies aren't difficult to run from, I found myself just running through areas avoiding enemies because of the horrid combat. Along with the weak combat, you'll get lost fairly easily as there's little to no direction regarding your goals.The game is short, so if you're looking for some cheap thrills, then I'd recommend it, but if you're looking for an engaging story and continuous horror, look elsewhere. 5/10			",117,31,1,17,7,1,15

												First off, I do recommend the next episode, and if you are buying that, this episode will likely come in a bundle with that. But regardless I found this episode to be kind of lackluster.The game controls like a typical first person game, except the bulk of the gameplay is puzzle solving similar to that found in classic point and click adventure games. These puzzles are nothing special but managed not to bore me too much. There is however a fair amount of finding a locked door then finding a key, literal or figurative, in some random place. Fortunately the areas are small enough that they are not usually hard to find. Where the episode fell flat for me was the supposed horror elements. In between the rooms with all the puzzles in them there are some kind of mutant dogs or wolves roaming the hallways. These to me were not scary and were just kind of annoying. The strategy for getting past them is generally just walking slowly and hiding slightly out of sight when one is in the way until it moves away. There are some other creatures you come across which you have to run away from and these sections are very trial and error. At least one of the creatures would be scary but when you've played the same part repeatedly because of the trial and error nature of the gameplay, it loses any scariness it once had.There isn't a whole lot to the story. You're trying to enter an underground facility to find out what happened to your father who mysteriously dissappeared. There are various obstacles in your way and some crazy guy talks to you over a radio to guide you along. If you were to start with the second episode, you'd find yourself in the middle of the facility without knowing how you got there but there isn't really that much necessary background information needed to enjoy the second episode.

												Visually, this games lacks, but the game is older. The story, music, and atmosphere are pretty good ad the games certainly gives u the creeps. The problem I had was the game doesn't want to load in properly and would make my screen start twitching to the point where it was unplayable. And the save points were horrible. Several times the game would save right in a bad spot where it would load, and u would be dead 5 seconds later.Maybe an older computer will have more luck, but not recommended by me.

												WHile I adore games like this I cannot recommend this title for any price other than $5 or below. The graphics and the texturing is horrible. The gameplay is ordinary and unscary. The areas are bleak and bland. The music and sound effects however are great. The overall game feels empty and just cohesioned with long tunnels and hallways that merit littlle interest. I will give credit to the concept; which is marginally if not minimally presented in a generic package. The best way to describe this title is...............DRYY!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When it was released, Penumbra had a relatively sophisticated physics engine. Too much of the game relies on the player marveling at the ability ot move objects around. And when that wears off, which it does very quickly, you're left with simplistic, unsatisfying puzzles.High points of the game are the writing, which you observe in the form of scattered notes, and voice-over work, which is limited. Overall, the game feels like a software physics project with game elements forced upon it.			",50,9,0,2,0,0,4

												Penumbra Overture is a strange one. It is classed survival/horror, but I felt neither of those. It felt more like a trial-by-death rage game. Try to do anything, you die, until you die enough times to feel out what specific actions you need to take to not die so quickly. Granted, I played on the hardest difficulty so it probably would have been quite a bit more manageable on lower difficulties, but the lack of direction killed it for me. Not on a macro story level, but on a micro encounter level. For example, hopefully without spoilers, one level immediately drops you into an encounter where the character states, in subtitles, that they need to seal ""that door"" whilst looking at a door that obviously can't be the target of the statement. You are then in a large room with somewhat of a gauntlet arrayed before you, and if you take more than half a second to look around, even to get your bearings for the first time, you are dead. It took me at least a couple dozen attempts to coincidentally use that half second in the right spot facing the right direction to realize there was a button. Then I died again. And that was just the first leg of the gauntlet. There were at least two of these situations, together probably representing half of the time I put into this short game. Half the time the game decides to ignore its own mechanics, such as an enemy completely ignoring a distraction that should have worked, and had worked on previous occassions, for no discernable reason. There were also several cases where I would be hiding behind cover, such as a box or around a corner, waiting for the chance to sneak by, and the dog I was hiding from would suddenly start growling and teleport right next to me to rip my throat out. This game made me feel as though there were some hidden timer, and I weren't allowed to go more than a half-minute without dying, usually for no fault of my own.The controls aren't very intuitive when it comes to the use of tools. I often found myself swinging short or my goal, or in a different manner than I wanted, which in itself got me killed quite often. There wasn't much story, nor was I particularly captivated, but this is only the first chapter in a trilogy. I did like the character Red very much however, in both his voice acting and portrayal. I will also admit that even with all these things, once the credits rolled I was surprised to find how small the crew was, and for the team size I think the game was pretty good.Context aside though, as the game itself stands I don't find myself compelled to recommend it.

												Ths game is kinda weak. I got myself worked up for the first 30 minutes of the game, not realising there wasn't any thing to chase me yet, and then when they got to their first ""scare"" it was just a spider the size of my hand just crawling past me. Then, when a REAL threat came around, it growled which startled me (this was when I was still excited about getting the game), but I crawled around a corner and saw it was a bloody ( yet still unintimidating) dog the size of my spaniel, that I could run past without it noticing. Then later I decided to whack it with a hammer that I got very early in the game and it FELL OVER AND SURE AS   HELL TOOK ITS TIME TO GET BACK UP. Later I got on a crate where the dog couldn't get me but wanted to, so I kept hitting it with the hammer, and it DIED. That left me free of the dog until I went to another area, skipping and singing, ""ding dong, the witch is dead."" I just wish they made a better, scarier, maybe IMMORTAL, at least, monster. Plus, the riddles are SO FREAKING HARD. Had to watch PewDiePie play it to know wtf I was doing. But don't listen to me completely, I haven't beaten it yet, and I heard it gets more intense. CONCLUSION: Not a scary game (to me) but don't be COMPLETELY persuaded. Also, definately play this if you wanna play this game's sequal, Penumbra: Black Plague, which IS quite scary, but you won't understand a single thing in it if you don't play this; Overture. If you absolutely DO NOT GIVE A â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the story, go ahead and play Black Plague, but you'll be left with a crap ending that you won't get or like if you don't play Overture.Ok, I've played the rest now and it got a LITTLE more scary.Just a couple parts with a huge worm. Long story.So, all in all, I'd just get Black Plague and just enjoy the scares.6.5/10 wud play baseball practice with some spiders agin			",48,7,0,1,4,0,0

												It's the first commercial release from Frictional Games, the guys who made Amnesia: TDD. There are a few high points in the game, like the good voice acting of the character named ""Red"" and also unsurprisingly the atmosphere is great. But on the other end of the scale the ""combat system"" is completely broken and the game has very loose ties to the personal story of the main character, because the whole game focuses on this ""Red"" guy who in the end is very unimportant.The sequel Penumbra: Black Plague is far superior, and at points is even better than Amnesia in my opinion. I know this is supposed to be a recommendation, but I quess I can also recommend people to stay away from games, so this one right here is definitely one you should skip.			",341,77,9,32,16,2,38

Try swinging a hammer...Come on, was this made so clunky on purpose? If so, then it's a lame way of making the game harder. AVOID unless you are some kind of a masochist and like reloading because a bloody basic thing like using a hammer makes you wnat to pull your hair out.

												This game uses the same old mouse control the other game did making ti difficult to do anything in the game handicapping the controls so much their broken, opening a door, or a drawer is terribly annoying.  The game seems glitchy skipping around or repeating old frames, not sure if that is intended or not.  Better than this game is Cryostasis with a better story, better controls, and better graphics, this game is just old and tired looking.  Maybe ten years ago this seems cool and innovative with the poo controls, but even then id just delete it for being annoying.  Rating:  0/0  Value:  $0.00			",2655,1119,101,266,362,29,398

												This is one of those survival horror games.  I guess people are buying this stuff.  It's not for me, though.  I played it for about ten minutes, then something spooky happened, I almost wet my pants, turned the game off, and hid under my bed quietly sobbing.  When I worked up the courage to turn the computer on again, I uninstalled the game.Pwninator score: 2/10			",40,2,1,3,4,0,5

Good: Great atmosphere. Have to play the sequels to get a complete picture, but the story is looking great so far. It has definitely caught my interest and I'm eager to play the next game in the series.  Bad: A bit too much dragging of items around for ""puzzles"". Combat is extremely clunky; you can go towards a more stealthy approach, but killing things gives my heart peace. Much shorter than expected.  100% recommend this game. I got a STALKER vibe while exploring and I loved it. Also check out the movie ""Devil's Pass"" for more of the same vibe (it's like Stalker meets LOST).			",63,15,0,8,4,2,12

												If you're looking at this game, it's most likely because you've heard of or played the famous Amnesia: The Dark Descent made by the same developers.  Penumbra: Overture is Frictional Game's first game and it definitely shares characteristics with Amnesia.The mood and style of the game is similar to Amnesia.  The lighting and eeriness of the locations set the tone of places you'd rather not be at.  Notes are scattered throughout the game, providing background history of the places you travel through.  The game is also physics based, but unlike Amnesia, you are allowed to have weapons, which does suggest that there is some form of defense.  However, the physics nature of the game requires the player to manually swing melee weapons by moving your mouse back and forth.  Nothing quite as fun as swinging in panic!  In addition to these, there are quite a bit more puzzles to solve, but nothing that is frustrating and some have satisfying complexity.If you're buying this game thinking you'll get the same experience as you did when playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent then you will be off the mark.  While it does share Amnesia's atmosphere of horror, its level of execution isn't the same.  A play through the game shows that a lot of thought went into finding ways to instill fear into the player, but it's unable to maintain the same pressure throughout the game.  If you want to get the same scares as one would get playing Amnesia, then you'll be disappointed.  But if you're interested in playing a horror game or seeing Frictional Game's earlier works, then it's worth picking up this title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Frictional Games' first outing.  A classic in my opinion and it made Frictional a dev I'll buy games from on release day(or earlier) and have no problem paying full price.It's not your traditional FPS.  There is some shooting but the idea is to keep confrontation to a minimum and just run the hell away from everything because it's so freaking scary that simply staring at the monsters for too long will drive you insane.  There are some pretty unique action controls that you probably haven't seen in an FPS before.  Some of it is awkward to get the hang of but it all ends up making sense just as SOMETHING IS BEHIND YOU FFS RUUUUUUN!<3 Frictional Games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Penumbra Overture is a chilling first person horror adventure that utilizes creepy lighting, music, and sounds to keep the hair on the back of your neck standing. The story isn't grade A quality, but the presentation is where it shines--revealing pieces slowly while purposely withholding information. The game isn't continuously scary, although it does offer several moments of adrenaline pumped fear as you push forward into the unknown. It offers some decent puzzles, good physical interaction, and fabulous choreography of events with sounds. Keep the lights off, the sound cranked up, and immerse yourself into its eerie atmosphere. For the best experience, combat should be avoided.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												The Penumbra series is one of the only horror series left in modern gaming - story driven, challenging, dark, and believe it or not, scary.  People call Doom, F.E.A.R., Dead Space, and Resident Evil 4-5 horror games even though they're no more than just shooters.  If you're looking for something more authentic and deep, then give Penumbra a try.  Remember to play them at night.			",133,24,3,22,2,1,12

												Penumbra is absolutely astounding. Being the predecessor of Amnesia it beats the living CRAP out of it in all ways; atmosphere (seriously, crawling on your hands and knees with no weapons, dogs howling around you while you're losing your sanity is intense), music (there is none, which I love, it brings a whole new level to insufferable solitary) and the plot. The monsters in the game aren't the typical 'le slender face' either, just dogs, spiders and demons, the simplicity makes it even more terrifying and certainly plays on your fear of the unknown.

												Penumbra Overture is a pretty darned cool game. Frictional games, creators of the critically acclaimed Amnesia: The Dark Descent made this Penumbra a few years before ATDD, and it doesn't disappoint!Scary atmosphere, and compelling scriptwriting make it a joy to play. The plot isn't particularly believable, but which horror game plot is nowadays. The controls feel a little clunky at times, and the combat system (which was thankfully done away with in Penumbra: Black Plague) is entirely optional, meaning you can attempt stealth playthroughs of the game.Grab the collection if its on sale, its worth the price!8/10!

												I played this game because I loved amnesia: the dark decent. i didn't have much expectations on the game, but I liked it in the end. It ok, but its worth playing it to play the second game, ""The black plauge"", thats the really good one. In the beginning when you are walkingt through a dark tunnel its scary but after that you are mostly in lighted rooms. But there are some fun atmospheric and scary moments. Like the lake, the worm chase and the room with the UV-Lamp text. There are basicly just 2 enemies. Zombie dog and big spider. Your attack is really bad. When fighting the zombie dogs you get a lot of diffrent things to lure them but to kill the enemies the easiest way is to just stand still att hit them when they attack. Hate the spiders, they are so annoying. >_< The story is hard to follow, but you grasp it and can but the parts together in the second part. Also the flashlight is so muth worse than the green tube whih never runs out of battery. But in ""black plauge"" they made the green tube worse so you have reason to use the flashlight. ^^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From my blog http://www.dyle.org/blog/game-penumbra-overtureFinished Penumbra: Overture 2 days ago.Played fully on Linux with Steam (native, no Windows Emulation).You are at the search for the mysterious death of your father. He worked at some mining complex at Greenland and that is the place the game starts right with the entrance to the pit at the gameâs cover. In the next 4 chapters you delve deeper and deeper to reveal the strange and frightening secrets of this place. Along your journey you find various items to use and even some weapons which you desperately need: this place is haunted by zombie-like dogs, gigantic worms and spiders the size of racoons. Eventually you discover excavations from alien origin and make contact to the sole survivor of this place: âRedâ which apparently has gone mad.As the game was created by Frictional Games the mechanics are very, very similar to Amnesia. This game is older and when playing you can see the polish the developers did to Amnesia.Compared to Amnesia this game letâs you actually kill your enemies, though it is a though job. Which is sorta strange, since the game changes dramatically once you know how to kill all these dogs in the corridors. Then the dominant opponent turns into a âpiece of cakeâ and whatâs left are the riddles to solve. However getting a grip on these Zombie-Dogs is not an easy task and it takes you several (!) attempts to figure out how to get rid of them.I can imagine why they dropped the possibility to kill enemies in Amnesia: here the game stops been frightening at this point.The riddles in the game are of different qualities. Some are stupidly easy and for some you simply get false hints, which is bad. I remember myself in chapter 4 been chased by a big worm. The game tells you to â â¦ to seal that doorâ.

												From my blog http://www.dyle.org/blog/game-penumbra-overtureFinished Penumbra: Overture 2 days ago.Played fully on Linux with Steam (native, no Windows Emulation).You are at the search for the mysterious death of your father. He worked at some mining complex at Greenland and that is the place the game starts right with the entrance to the pit at the gameâs cover. In the next 4 chapters you delve deeper and deeper to reveal the strange and frightening secrets of this place. Along your journey you find various items to use and even some weapons which you desperately need: this place is haunted by zombie-like dogs, gigantic worms and spiders the size of racoons. Eventually you discover excavations from alien origin and make contact to the sole survivor of this place: âRedâ which apparently has gone mad.As the game was created by Frictional Games the mechanics are very, very similar to Amnesia. This game is older and when playing you can see the polish the developers did to Amnesia.Compared to Amnesia this game letâs you actually kill your enemies, though it is a though job. Which is sorta strange, since the game changes dramatically once you know how to kill all these dogs in the corridors. Then the dominant opponent turns into a âpiece of cakeâ and whatâs left are the riddles to solve. However getting a grip on these Zombie-Dogs is not an easy task and it takes you several (!) attempts to figure out how to get rid of them.I can imagine why they dropped the possibility to kill enemies in Amnesia: here the game stops been frightening at this point.The riddles in the game are of different qualities. Some are stupidly easy and for some you simply get false hints, which is bad. I remember myself in chapter 4 been chased by a big worm. The game tells you to â â¦ to seal that doorâ. Right then you find a crate on the right side. When I jumped up the crate I couldnât reach the door mechanics, but the worm didnât appear. So I thought Iâm on the right place and tried over and over and over and over to get somewhere from that position. Wrong! I needed to simply push a button on the left side of the door! And sealing the door didnât help either â¦Such quirks appear occasionally in the game: game mechanics great, story telling nice, riddles range from childish to misleading.Still, walking the strange mine renders some nice and creepy impressions, 7/10.

This one sounded like it might be similar to the Thief series, and it didnât disappoint!  Best played alone at night with the lights off, this game has you exploring a dark, dangerous old mine to find out what happened to your father.  This game is highly likely to startle and eventually disturb you.  If you already have it through the Bundle and havenât tried it you should absolutely check it out!  I even recommend buying it â Steam has it for $9.99 and itâs well worth it.			",857,380,26,121,102,9,190

												Penumbra Overture is a chilling first person horror adventure that utilizes creepy lighting, music, and sounds to keep the hair on the back of your neck standing. The story isn't grade A quality, but the presentation is where it shines--revealing pieces slowly while purposely withholding information. The game isn't continuously scary, although it does offer several moments of adrenaline pumped fear as you push forward into the unknown. It offers some decent puzzles, good physical interaction, and fabulous choreography of events with sounds. Keep the lights off, the sound cranked up, and immerse yourself into its eerie atmosphere. For the best experience, combat should be avoided.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Frictional Games' first outing.  A classic in my opinion and it made Frictional a dev I'll buy games from on release day(or earlier) and have no problem paying full price.It's not your traditional FPS.  There is some shooting but the idea is to keep confrontation to a minimum and just run the hell away from everything because it's so freaking scary that simply staring at the monsters for too long will drive you insane.  There are some pretty unique action controls that you probably haven't seen in an FPS before.  Some of it is awkward to get the hang of but it all ends up making sense just as SOMETHING IS BEHIND YOU FFS RUUUUUUN!<3 Frictional Games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mesmo sendo dos mesmos caras que fizeram o Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Penumbra: Overture Ã© bem inferior. Sua histÃ³ria Ã© confusa e bem superficial, e o sistema de combate Ã© desprezÃ­vel de tÃ£o ruim. Vale a pena somente se vocÃª gosta de survival horror, jÃ¡ que no quesito ambientaÃ§Ã£o o jogo nÃ£o decepciona.			",171,18,3,8,10,0,18

												PENUMBRA OVERTURE holds up all right considering that it's almost ten years old now. There's a noticeable lack of jumpscares, but as other reviewers have mentioned before, once you realise how to keep the hard-to-hit spiders away from you and learn how to dodge the clunky AI of the dogs, you're pretty much in the clear. Still, it's a nice game to ram through during a long Sunday afternoon. Knowing there are further chapters already released makes up for an otherwise somewhat unsatisfying ending: definitely get it as a pack.			",49,45,1,3,2,0,1

												Absolute must-play for anyone interested in survival horror. Frictional's pre-Amnesia take on what would become the groundwork for first-person horror is, and especially for its time, an absolute masterclass. If you enjoyed either of the Amnesia titles or are a horror fan in general, play this. You'll get the bone-chilling tension you want out of a horror game with some incredible atmospherics to boot.

												I am in love with Penumbra: Overture, mainly for it's foreboding atmosphere and ambience.

Simply put, it'sâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ It was horrible and clunky as hell, so I ended up trying to avoid the enemies, instead of putting up a fight.I mean, other than that, I'd recommend this game.

												Another wondeful gaming experience. (TL DR VERSION BELOW!)Penumbra: Overture is not properly a game as we are used to play, is more like an immersion into deep abyss of horror and mistery.This is to say you are not buying this game for his gameplay, his longevity or his action.If you played Amnesia, Soma or the other Penumbra you know what I'm meaning. If you don't, well think twice before buying it even if the price is low.Those kind of game are not much appreciated by the average gamer who looks for a couple or more hour of FUN.When you buy Penumbra you want to live a different experience, a journey into mistery and creepy stuff.It's quite short, graphic are still ok in my opinion if you don't mind too much (you don't really have to if you are wishing to play this graphic are the least thing to mind)When you finish it you feel that feeling of satisfaction as you survived a 7hrs trip into this game.It's something games like Fallout,Skyrim or whatever call of duty or battlefield could never give to you. Even if they might be good games, they are nothing in terms  of deepness and peculiarity.TL DR:PROS-Atmosphere, deepness, peculiarity, horror. You really are yourself as a normal human being would, trying to escape from a mine, you don't fight unless if really you have to (and you will die trying), you don't have superpower. Only your mind and your notes. That's it.CONS-Only English language, it's not a problem if you are reading this but there is a lot of stuff to read if you want to understand more the story, and even some dialogue with the only human (?) you ""meet"" are quite hard to follow because it's not a simple english. I really had some problems too as is not my mother tongue.			",76,6,0,8,3,1,10

												Overture and Black Plague are two halves of the same game.  Overture is part 1, Black Plague is part 2.  The second part is a direct continuation and has the same game mechanics/gameplay (except a few minor differences) so this review is for both games.  First of all I rate this 9/10.  Part 1 has terrible combat and that's the only reason it's not a 10/10.  Luckily the devs seemed to realize how bad the combat was and completely axed it in part 2, so like Amnesia you must run from or outwit monsters instead of engaging them.Overture is primarily a puzzle solver.  It's not too scary, but it does have a creepy atmosphere.  What I love about Frictional Games is that their puzzles are very sensible, although there were a few here that had me really confused.  Part of the problem is that you have to destroy your environment sometimes, but there's no indication which objects are destructble and which aren't- and sometimes you have monsters on your heels, so it's hard to look around and search the environment to figure out what to do before you die.Black Plague is where the game starts to get really interesting.  It has an AMAZING story, and in addition to good puzzles (less environment destroying in this one) the setting is truly horrific.  Amnesia didn't scare me, but this game did.  It doesn't even use cheap pop-ups, (well a few) instead relying on music/sounds and unsettling atmosphere.  Psychological horror at its finest.The story is intensely engaging.  You will care about the friends/family the protagonist (Phillip) encounters in his journey.  There are many sad moments.  But the true meat of the plot lies in an ancient mystery you will slowly unravel as you discover the many notes, books, and strange artifacts strewn throughout the mining/research facility.  The ending is satisfying in that it gives you the answers you seek and doesn't leave you hanging, although I was somewhat disapointed that you appear to be presented with a choice, yet your character can only make one in the end.

												May not be as scary as say Amnesia but this is one survival horror that you shouldn't miss. Its fun, challenging and very very creepy.Combat is difficult so you can't always rely on the ""weapons"" you get, which makes the game interesting because a game isn't a horror game if you can easily fight your way through all your enemies. This game was great. I hope to get Penumbra: Black Plague very soon.			",97,9,0,15,12,2,6

												I love horror games, especially first person horror games, and I REALLY wish I could write a better review for this one. I understand a game where the atmosphere is important, that's what gives the game immersion. All Penumbra: Overture had was immerson techniques used by lights, textures and audio. I thought that in itself was really cool, and halfway through playing I was wondering when the ""scares"" were going to happen. They never came. It took me four hours to get through this game because I wanted to get everything I could out of it. Overture is not a bad game in any means, but it lacks what every horror game needs: horror. I'd still recommend it, though. Just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it won't hopefully scare someone else's socks off! If you choose to get it, have fun! However, if you're aso wondering why there aren't any scares, play through it for the experience. 4/10 for me :(			",23,4,0,9,2,0,0

												Penumbra Overture is a great horror game that combines puzzle and first person elements to create a suspenseful atmosphere.  You must lead your character throughout an abandoned underground military base while thwarting the horrors that dwell there and discovering clues about your past.  This game is unique from others in the way it creates tension.  It is not so direct as other horror games, but I guarantee it will keep you on the edge of your seat.			",284,46,6,17,24,3,24

												Nice game. Not exactly the scariest horror game I've played, but there is this weird lovecraftian feeling when you don't know what's happening around you. The enemies are you joke, you can just run past them and enter the next door.However, the overall atmosphere is really nice and the puzzles are really innovative. The game even becomes emotional and if you like it, you'll probably want to install Black Plague right after finishing Overture.			",633,216,23,81,65,7,90

												It's clear this game had an assortment of great modern features that were somewhat under-developed at the time of Overture's release, but would eventually - with experience and focus - be appeciated for their innovation when the second game in the series, Black Plague, was released.I'm not massively into horror games - I lack the nerves of steel required to fully absorb them, but I do love exploring locations rich in atmosphere, with fresh storytelling and immersive sound design bolted on top. Combat aside, I enjoyed my time with this game. I was always interested in how the story would progress (the character of Red was great to listen to and very reminiscient of BioShock's Sander Cohen), and I think the environments, though sometimes lacking creativity, were enjoyable enough to move around in.The combat however is clearly the biggest issue, which basically amounts to a Benny Hill-style run around a cramped location with you occasionally stopping to turn and smack a crazed zombie dog snapping at your heels in the face with the world's smallest hammer. Thankfully, Frictional Games chose to remove self-defense entirely from the sequel, Black Plague, so you just have to grit your teeth and take solace in the fact the next game will be a much less clunky experience. The story and exploration's still great though, it's definitely worth playing if you enjoyed Frictional's other games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Run from the dogs: The SimulatorHaven't played Penumbra games as first Frictional game I played was ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"", which I really liked a lot. So going back to older Frictional games was quite odd.Anyhow, game is horror'wise quite weak and the ""combat"" is just horrific, but the storytelling & puzzles make up for it. Considering this is first frictional games game & it's almost 10 years old then this game is quite good. So obviously it isn't as polished gameplay'wise nor looks as amazing in comparison to newer Frictional games  titles, but that was a great start and there are 2 more chapters to this game.Though i found it easier to run & lead dogs rather than avoiding them altogether.Seriously.. those damn dogs..Ending was somewhat sad as well.Want a game with interesting Puzzles & Story then sure, play this game.In a nutshell:+Interesting story+Great puzzles+Fitting atmosphere-Isn't as ""scary"" as hoped for-Horrific combat7/10			",181,24,3,25,13,1,31

												With poor visual appeal, the whole game just screams ""LOW PRODUCTION VALUES"" when compared to contemporary titles.However, far from it for Penumbra to succumb to low-production values on every front, the voice acting of the characters is phenomenal. Coupled with the game's inherently interesting plot (for those who simply can't walk away from a narrative like this) Penumbra boasts a wonderfully well-written and well-made storyline.It brings complex puzzle-solving gameplay with a pall of eeriness cast upon the game that leaves you wanting to take a few steps back every time you make one step forward.In addition to this, right from the beginning, for those interested at all in analytics, the game harps, rather subtly, on human nature. Howard, Philip, Red, all well-animated characters (figuratively speaking... of course) provide the game with a less-than-subtle hint of humanity.All in all one of the most well intriguing and captivating games I've played in quite some time.

												After completeing this title a little over 5 months ago (After putting it off for a long time) --- I can quite honestly say: if you haven't played it, please do... Being the same developer, it is the direct spiritual predeccesor of Amnesia and, quite frankly, brought Amnesia to it's success. Without the technology developed from this small series, we wouldn't be experiencing the horrifying, dark, immersive 3D experience that we know today. This game never got that much credit, where much credit is due. I would LOVE to live to the day where survival horror saw more games akin to this. If you REALLY want the pants scared off of you - I'd highly recommend it's successor - Black Plague. 10$, you can't beat that price for such a beautifully crafted masterpiece.			",40,4,0,8,4,0,3

												Maybe it's because I've been so spoiled playing Amnesia Dark Descent and Outlast... but this game only spooked me a little bit. The puzzles and figuring out things was fun... but the creatures among the puzzles were just annoying after a while. A couple things did take me by surprise, but over all... I was kind of disappointed.Story line? ""oh where is everyone? oh what happened to my dad? oh what are these weird lanterns? oh how do i get out""I finished this game in under 6 hours.Bug report: early on in the game I had my grab/interact mouse disappear on me. Had to restart.Controlling was very easy for the most part. Keyboard and mouse. The ONE thing that bothered me the most was having to shake my mouse like an idiot just to swing a hammer or a pick-axe. -.-Motionsickness? Yes, unfortunately. I think the repetative tight corridors and looking around for clues is what did me in.Would I recommend this? Well... maybe. I don't know. Personally, if you want a game not as scary as Amnesia DD, then sure... but if you are really looking for loads of OH GOD MY HEART! then... I'd actually say skip it. o_o Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. it just wasn't great.I think maybe I will recommend if you're kind of looking for a horror game to quickly pass the time OR if you scare really easily. Just maybe get it on sale.Here is hoping Penumbra Black Plague will be scarier.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Penumbra Collectors Pack is only $10, and it contains some of the best survival horror games ever made. It is practically a steal. If you are remotely intrested in survival horror games, you HAVE to buy it. Especially when its on sale.Great plot, characters, gameplay, and atmosphere all combine to make one of my favorite game series of all time.Keep in mind, they are indie games from 2007 - 8, so they can be a bit clunky. It doesn't impact the experience much, though.			",105,16,1,5,5,0,8

												Penumbra describes itself as a ""first person survival horror game"". Actually, Penumbra was the game that defined this genre.There is no gore - the game completely relies on its incredible eerie, dark atmosphere instead of on blood and guts.The puzzles are challenging, but not too hard for casual adventure players.Nice graphics, incredible, dark, sounds and music.

												This was the first game that introduced me to the works of the  great small company named Frictional Games. And as it often happens with ""first""s - it's the most impressive horror game for me. When I play it now - I have a huge feeling of nostalgia.The plot is great. Mystery of the father's letter, the idea of a small man trapped inside an unknown bunker in the middle of nowhere, the enormous size of that underground construction... this is all very intriguing! In this game a lot of experiences were concentrated together. At first, it was like reading a very interesting fantastic book. At second, it was very immersive experience of being trapped in this bunker where the only way out is to go deeper into the unknown. At third it was innovative system of the interaction with ingame objects, where your mouse (and so your hand) becomes your virtual hand. Forth - it was a real true horror game, where scary things are made not of sudden flashes or jump-out monsters, but horror of the atmosphere, vulnerability and loneliness. Fifth - a lot of physical objects that you need to interact with, made the game even more immersive, because you see less scripting and more like simulation of virtual world. There was also a great musical theme in menu that touched me when I first launched the game.As a verdict I can say that this game is at the top of experience of all games I played.If I hadn't play this game I'd missed a lot in my life. Usually a lot of games for me is just a waste of time, and I wouldn't regret if I had never played them, but definitely not this one.			",121,50,4,3,11,0,2

												Nice game. Not exactly the scariest horror game I've played, but there is this weird lovecraftian feeling when you don't know what's happening around you. The enemies are you joke, you can just run past them and enter the next door.However, the overall atmosphere is really nice and the puzzles are really innovative. The game even becomes emotional and if you like it, you'll probably want to install Black Plague right after finishing Overture.			",633,216,23,81,65,7,90

												The practicality of its puzzles is P:O's strong point. The problems and their solutions all feel firmly rooted in the world you are exploring, and solving them elicits a nod of satisfaction for their intuitiveness. Beyond that, the gameplay is rather lacking. The enemies that can be combatted present zero threat or challenge, resulting in a severe lack of tension throughout the journey. Fortunately the exploration and mystery is the far bigger draw and well worth a playthrough.			",184,50,3,30,13,1,11

												I played Amnesia before Overture, so I was expecting a more flight or die kind of gameplay. It was shocking to me when I discovered I could kill the creatures in the game. I won't say what they are as to not spoil it for anybody. Anyways, right from the get go I was interested to find out where the story was going, more so than I was with Amnesia. Albeit the settings in Amnesia are better, I do find the story better in this, and I like how it is episodic. I felt the combat to be clunky, but it got the job done. More of a thriller than a horror game. I just finished it, and now I am currently installing Black Plague, I most certainly want to see how this finishes. I won't state ""if you're a fan of..."", but check it out if you're wanting a good story in a pretty atmospheric world.			",39,4,0,13,2,0,2

												This game is really great. I must say this game for it's time is awesome, compared to Amnesia it is not all that much, but what can you expect since this game was created earlier. Penumbra really leaves you wanting more.Penumbra is different from Amnesia, since you have weapons and can fight. It is a different experience that should be played. The fight mechanics are a little wonky and some of the puzzles are a bit odd, but it still is a great game. Overall I think Penumbra Overture gets a 8.9/10 ",120,24,0,42,41,3,43

												While the first half of the game is extremely scary, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. I think that imagining what was going on in the game was much better than the actual reveal.That said, this is a fantastic game. The atmosphere really draws you in and gives a sense of being alone in the dark. The level progression layouts are well-designed, allowing you to visit the same areas multiple without it feeling repetitive. The enemies are tough without being impossible and some of the puzzles are real dome-scratchers. The weapons system is neat but has one drawback- each attack is super slow and it's easy to get killed by an enemy because you couldn't swing your weapon in time. For people who don't want to go head to head with them, there are also multiple ways to incapacititate or evade enemies. Much of the game is stealth-based, making the creepy, ominous atmosphere even more tense. You never know if you're about to walk straight into something that wants to kill you- and will.The story was interesting, remaining a complete mystery until almost the very end of the game. The story setup was brief without being rushed, allowing you to get right to playing with a million questions you want answered already.Great horror FPS, runs great on older laptops with integrated graphics, great voice-over acting, great game. For an especially sweet deal, buy this game during a steam sale for about $5. You won't be disappointed.			",201,85,8,15,10,3,12

												This game is great, as long as you know what you're getting into.If you're looking for a plethora of things to kill and ways to kill them, this is not the game for you. The few ""weapons"" you encounter are tools that are used more for their intended purposes than they are for slaughter. Most of the time you're better off just running away from combat, as the tools don't do much damage anyway.The atmosphere and the creativity of this game make it an experience that differs from the norm, and this is the real reason to play it. The setting is very eerie and a nod to old survival horror games, placing more emphasis on survival than conflict. The sound effects can be very unsettling, and the ever-present snarls of the wild dogs send a chill up your spine. While not ""scary"" in the traditional sense, there are moments where the game will leave you with a distinct feeling of unease. The puzzles can be somewhat difficult at times, but you can't help but admire their creativity and thought-provoking nature. Notes and letters are more than just collectibles here. Many of them are vital to puzzle-solving and advancement, so make sure you read everything you encounter and pay close attention to clues.Considering you get both games in a $10.00 package, it's definitely a great value. Though if you don't mind waiting, I picked mine up during a sale for 50% less, which made it even more worthwhile.Admittedly, I have yet to finish the game. But I'm several hours in and I would already recommend it to those who enjoy a straight-up adventure game as opposed to the ever popular shoot-em-up. Looking forward to finishing this up and moving on to the follow-up, ""Black Plague"", which I'm told is even better.			",17,8,0,2,0,0,0

												A predecessor to the (in)famous Amnesia, Penumbra is a diamond in the rough that incites fear through storytelling and some fine voice acting rather than the overuse of jump-scares and B-movie cliches.  What results from this great narrative is a short but truly discomorting game where the fear comes from the pervading sense of dread as you delve deeper venture the mine and uncover more of its backstory.  Though this game is dated in appearance, anyone who found Amnesia to be entertaining will likely feel at home with this game, with the physics based puzzles and Frictional's unique take on horror first established here. After nearly 8 years it still stands strong.			",84,12,0,7,6,0,8

												I came to this game way after both Amnesia so I had a little idea of what to expect even if it wouldn't be as polished as the later game.I wouldn't say the atmosphere is all that scary compared to Amnesia, but the sense of exploration and piecing the story together yourself is much the same. The certainly isn't a game you just blaze through. If you don't spend the time reading the notes and such left around and immersing yourself in the lore you'll find the game a bit empty.The good: intriguing early story; some smart puzzles; manual interaction with doors et al for good sense of immersion.The bad: a bit ""was that it?"" at the end (though obviously this is only the setup to the rest of the series); lack of variety in enemies; controlling the tools/weapons can be a bit obtuse.

The controls are identical, the atmosphere is terrifying and it's quite fun to imagine yourself in the protagonist's place.  The main thing I'm slightly iffy about is how the story starts off.  The warning that is shown when you first open the game is vague, but it makes you want to know more.  Would play again and again and again.			",35,8,0,13,3,0,2

												Postal 2 is an amazing game! It has a hilarious story line, a vast array of weapons, and a lot of gameplay. In my opinion, Running With Scissors did an amazing job at this game. I recommend it to everyone about 15 or older due to a lot of innapropriate content. I rate this game 10/10.			",254,42,1,29,15,1,13

												I love horror games, especially first person horror games, and I REALLY wish I could write a better review for this one. I understand a game where the atmosphere is important, that's what gives the game immersion. All Penumbra: Overture had was immerson techniques used by lights, textures and audio. I thought that in itself was really cool, and halfway through playing I was wondering when the ""scares"" were going to happen. They never came. It took me four hours to get through this game because I wanted to get everything I could out of it. Overture is not a bad game in any means, but it lacks what every horror game needs: horror. I'd still recommend it, though. Just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it won't hopefully scare someone else's socks off! If you choose to get it, have fun! However, if you're aso wondering why there aren't any scares, play through it for the experience. 4/10 for me :(			",23,4,0,9,2,0,0

												Overture is a puzzle game that for some stupid reason thought that fighting mechanics are a good idea and so they made a bunch of stupidly long puzzles where you get chased while trying to brake a wooden barricade and failing because for some reason the main character decided it's a good idea to shank the wood with a pick.Would not recommend if you hate getting killed by dogs,buy Black Plague instead.

(Original post date and time: Jan 15, 2013 @ 11:25pm)Penumbra: Overture is very much worth the money! This game is scary, but it doesn't rely on random scares(jumpscares) most of the time to make it scary, this game relies on it's environment and ambience to give the player that unsettling feeling so they can get the full experience out of the game! If you enjoy horror games, this will most likely feed your hunger for horror and some!			",156,14,3,4,10,1,9

												Let's get one thing out of the way first: I'd reccomended this game based solely on the experince and story alone and the cheap price ($10 for the bundle with it as well as it's sequels) only sweetens the deal. The graphics, atmosphere, sound design, and story are all top notch. This is also pretty much the game that started the exploration heavy and combat-light based gameplay-style for indie-horror that Amnesia later codified. I DO have some complaints about the gameplay machanics that anyone thinking of buying this should now about, though:*The combat is clunky and barely responsive. I can see that were going for for a immerisve and substansal feeling system with interaction beyond clicking a button to swing, but it was implemented horribly. It consists of holding the action button to ready yourself, and using the mouse to swing but it takes such broad movements that it's hard to hit anything and good luck lining up enemies when they can simply step out of your hitzone because you obiously can't move the camera while holding the action button.*I won't post spoilers here, but some of the puzzles violate common sense or rely to much on really diffcult trial and error along with memorization. Some also do downright underhanded things like requiring you know morse-code with nothing but a code-sheet and no indication how to tell dashes from dots.Normally I'd trash this game, but the story and art design made up for the short-comings in the gameplay and made worth powering through to the end.

												This game is great, as long as you know what you're getting into.If you're looking for a plethora of things to kill and ways to kill them, this is not the game for you. The few ""weapons"" you encounter are tools that are used more for their intended purposes than they are for slaughter. Most of the time you're better off just running away from combat, as the tools don't do much damage anyway.The atmosphere and the creativity of this game make it an experience that differs from the norm, and this is the real reason to play it. The setting is very eerie and a nod to old survival horror games, placing more emphasis on survival than conflict. The sound effects can be very unsettling, and the ever-present snarls of the wild dogs send a chill up your spine. While not ""scary"" in the traditional sense, there are moments where the game will leave you with a distinct feeling of unease. The puzzles can be somewhat difficult at times, but you can't help but admire their creativity and thought-provoking nature. Notes and letters are more than just collectibles here. Many of them are vital to puzzle-solving and advancement, so make sure you read everything you encounter and pay close attention to clues.Considering you get both games in a $10.00 package, it's definitely a great value. Though if you don't mind waiting, I picked mine up during a sale for 50% less, which made it even more worthwhile.Admittedly, I have yet to finish the game. But I'm several hours in and I would already recommend it to those who enjoy a straight-up adventure game as opposed to the ever popular shoot-em-up. Looking forward to finishing this up and moving on to the follow-up, ""Black Plague"", which I'm told is even better.			",17,8,0,2,0,0,0

												This game is a must for any puzzle/horror fun who wants  a thrill ride fueled with mystery. Some times the game glitches out during puzzles, forcing you to reload a previous save. Save points are quite few and far between so beware, if something seems off and you've already tried everything, then its most probably glitched and you will need to reload. Other than that the story is interesting and mysterious, tempting you to see it through to the end just so you know what happens.			",42,11,0,8,1,0,2

												The practicality of its puzzles is P:O's strong point. The problems and their solutions all feel firmly rooted in the world you are exploring, and solving them elicits a nod of satisfaction for their intuitiveness. Beyond that, the gameplay is rather lacking. The enemies that can be combatted present zero threat or challenge, resulting in a severe lack of tension throughout the journey. Fortunately the exploration and mystery is the far bigger draw and well worth a playthrough.			",184,50,3,30,13,1,11

												I played Amnesia before Overture, so I was expecting a more flight or die kind of gameplay. It was shocking to me when I discovered I could kill the creatures in the game. I won't say what they are as to not spoil it for anybody. Anyways, right from the get go I was interested to find out where the story was going, more so than I was with Amnesia. Albeit the settings in Amnesia are better, I do find the story better in this, and I like how it is episodic. I felt the combat to be clunky, but it got the job done. More of a thriller than a horror game. I just finished it, and now I am currently installing Black Plague, I most certainly want to see how this finishes. I won't state ""if you're a fan of..."", but check it out if you're wanting a good story in a pretty atmospheric world.			",39,4,0,13,2,0,2

												    Interesting enough game to keep you hooked. My BIG complaint is the programming of the mellee weapon attack. It IS hideous, really. That...coupled with having to un-equip a mellee weapon before you can interact with objects or function buttons/activations really makes things very awkward. Even though these are 1 handed weapons you still can't press a button, grab a door?? It seems like the game wants you to use environmental mechanics to deal with deadly creatures...but that very odd equip...un-equip combo in the heat of battle gets very annoying & makes things a ton more 'fingers & thumbs' than they need to be.    Base generic enemies too. But, otherwise a goodish time... :-)  Only recommended when on sale. I think I paid $2-$3 for all 3 games...so yeah good for that...any more...not sure...

The controls are identical, the atmosphere is terrifying and it's quite fun to imagine yourself in the protagonist's place.  The main thing I'm slightly iffy about is how the story starts off.  The warning that is shown when you first open the game is vague, but it makes you want to know more.  Would play again and again and again.			",35,8,0,13,3,0,2

												""The Penumbra Series"" was created by Frictional Games. As many know, they are the creaters of the none-stop famous ""Amnesia Series"". I first started off with ""Amnesia The Dark Decent"", then ""Amnesia A Machine For Pigs""before ever playing Penumbra. I haven't seen any play throughs on Penumbra (nore Amnesia at the time) because I love to be suprised, and love to figure things out myself. With Penumbra, it take almost if not EXACTLY the same game mechanics as Amnesia! Just slightly different in very VERY small ways. And with that being said, that's not a bad thing! I know I may be a tad bit late to review this game since it's been out for quite sometime. I haven't even beaten the game just yet, but I am pretty far, and already I love it! I am thankful that Frictional games takes a good notice at their Mac users (cause i'm a Mac user) and gaming on my Macbook Pro isn't that bad at all. The game runs fairly smooth, and doesn't lag at all. I am impressed with the Story Line as well (which I think most people don't care about in these Phsychological Horror Games.) The story is one thing that makes these games what they are! Very mystical, quite a few jump scares here and there, and it's even better when all lights are off. I have yet to play the other ones (which I did purchase) and am so anxious! I would recomend this game to any Horror Game fan, or someone who just flat out wants a good scare here and there, with a few mid to hard puzzles to solve. I would give this game a 10/10.

												got no idea what to say,well this is amazing game its not even a horror couse you got weapon and you can protect your self,there is also no scares (jump scares or monster jumping at you) and that is very disappointing for me :( , but still the story is amazing + its an a hard game just like the second one-The Black Plague.and its got one bad thing about it(controls tottaly s*cks balls), hitting key with a pickaxe or the hammer-you have to like move you hand from left to right to hit, k this game totaly s*cks balls but the story is amazing if you want a real horror expirianse you should play the Penumbra:Black Plague and its an a great deal to get this 2 cool game only in 10$. :)The Rate about the game is = 8/10and The Black Plague = 10/10very recomend to buy this ""Penumbra Collectors Pack"".

												Run from the dogs: The SimulatorHaven't played Penumbra games as first Frictional game I played was ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"", which I really liked a lot. So going back to older Frictional games was quite odd.Anyhow, game is horror'wise quite weak and the ""combat"" is just horrific, but the storytelling & puzzles make up for it. Considering this is first frictional games game & it's almost 10 years old then this game is quite good. So obviously it isn't as polished gameplay'wise nor looks as amazing in comparison to newer Frictional games  titles, but that was a great start and there are 2 more chapters to this game.Though i found it easier to run & lead dogs rather than avoiding them altogether.Seriously.. those damn dogs..Ending was somewhat sad as well.Want a game with interesting Puzzles & Story then sure, play this game.In a nutshell:+Interesting story+Great puzzles+Fitting atmosphere-Isn't as ""scary"" as hoped for-Horrific combat7/10			",181,24,3,25,13,1,31

												This was a lot of fun. Penumbra Oveture was a little bit easier than I expected and I seemed to natively understand all the 'puzzles' so it didn't challenge me much. I also seemed to go to the right place every time so I always had the appropriate items. Very atmospheric and plenty of frights. I was a little disappointed at the lack of variety with regards to the enemies especially when I realized how powerful the pickaxe was. Definitely worth your dosh.			",288,63,1,43,27,2,45

												A very short game but there's a reason why people are afraid while playing it. The atmosphere is perfect so that seeing a dead body is either scary or striking, the enemies in the game are incredibly difficult to kill so that you'll actually use the (very forgiving) stealth system and when the game wants to let you know that you escaped on the edge of your teeth, dear lord you feel it.Also there is a rather striking moment late in the game involving your friend Red. I saw it coming and it still sparked some emotions.			",180,53,0,13,9,3,11

												Pretty decent game here.  Survival horror game where you use your brain to think of ways to progress through the levels/areas opposed to the mindless shooting crap with a gun while running around type of horror games out there.  Not very much intense action involved in this game, which makes you slow down and concentrate and look for things while being creeped out by the strange atmospheric sounds and visual surroundings.  This game is best played in the dark with sound up,  all makes the experience much better.  The game is rather short, beat in in about 4 or 5 hour, but for what you pay to get this game makes it all worth it.  A title I suggest my friends to pick up if you dont mind getting spooked.Raiting: 7/10			",461,100,19,63,58,7,70

												Downloaded this game (and it's sequels) in preparation for Amnesia. A good game, (if a little short) atmospheric, puzzles can be a little irritating, but satisfactory once solved. However, combat is plonky and players should stick to stealth, I also noticed that health regenerates (I was playing on easy) I never died in the one instance of accidental direct combat. Other minor complaints are that when I started the game up I had to tinker with the graphics just get some colour and clear picture.All in all, enjoyable experience. Makes me glad I bought it in a bundle			",18,1,0,1,1,0,0

												The Penumbra Collectors Pack is only $10, and it contains some of the best survival horror games ever made. It is practically a steal. If you are remotely intrested in survival horror games, you HAVE to buy it. Especially when its on sale.Great plot, characters, gameplay, and atmosphere all combine to make one of my favorite game series of all time.Keep in mind, they are indie games from 2007 - 8, so they can be a bit clunky. It doesn't impact the experience much, though.			",105,16,1,5,5,0,8

												(TL;DR at the bottom)Eh, if I were to sum up Penumbra: Overture, I would call it a watered down version of Black Plague, wich again was a watered down version of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. You can tell quite clearly that this was frictional's first attempt at a game, and I would say it's their weakest game (after AMFP of course). The mix of combat and stealth feels kinda off, like it was tacked on, as it feels incredibly stiff and uncontrollable (yes, I realize that's to highten the tension, but I'll get back on that). Because the combat just wasn't very playtested it seems, there are some pretty obvious exploits to make game incredibly easy and pop the tension like a balloon. For example, if you stand on top of a crate/barrel, you are invincible, and you're free to smack the livingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of the dogs when they're trying to reach up to you. I found this exploit extremely early on and decided not to use it to get a better horror experience, but just knowing that I had this ridiculous advantage just removed the scare factor for me.On top of that, overture suffers from the same thing as Black Plauge, wich is balance between horror and puzzles. Where BP improved a little bit on this front (I would say 65% puzzles and 35% spooks), Overture is more like a 80/20. Because of that, Overture doesn't really feel like a horror game (and even less so if you use the exploit mentioned). The entire game is laid out like this. There are about 3/4 large areas with puzzles to be solved in order, with most of the puzzles requiring an item on the other side of the area (I would guess to stretch the lenght of the game out). Now this would be fine if you had a constant mix of horror and puzzles like A:TDD, but in Overture you enter an area, kill the dogs, and then spend like 30 minutes solving the puzzles (though, a few places throw in spiders, and the last level with the giant worm. But again, these just aren't that scary, considering you have a small arsenal and the monsters are genuinely unfrightening, predictable and easy to overcome). If you're a fan of puzzlers though, you'll feel right at home here, as Penumbra: Overture at heart, is a puzzle game with a spooky mid-tone.TL;DRPros:+ Great atmosphere (at first, anyway)+ Genuinely challenging puzzles+ Alright story+ Great voice acting+ Superb writing (except for a few typos)Neutral:= Extremely heavy with puzzles= Ok graphichs (Quite muddy and low-res, but it gets the job done, therefore I didn't have the heart to list it as a con. The lighting is great aswell)Cons:- Short (3-4 hours)- The weapons are poorly implemented- Predictable and non-threatening enemies- Repetetive gameplay- Some odd level design here and there I'm on the fence with this one. I mean, it's a good PUZZLE game, but not a good HORROR game. I'm just barely giving this one a reccomendation, as there are ways of playing that make it scarier, and it's stealth aspect, but if you're looking for horror, look elsewhere.Overall: 6/10			",142,9,0,7,8,2,3

												Maybe it's because I've been so spoiled playing Amnesia Dark Descent and Outlast... but this game only spooked me a little bit. The puzzles and figuring out things was fun... but the creatures among the puzzles were just annoying after a while. A couple things did take me by surprise, but over all... I was kind of disappointed.Story line? ""oh where is everyone? oh what happened to my dad? oh what are these weird lanterns? oh how do i get out""I finished this game in under 6 hours.Bug report: early on in the game I had my grab/interact mouse disappear on me. Had to restart.Controlling was very easy for the most part. Keyboard and mouse. The ONE thing that bothered me the most was having to shake my mouse like an idiot just to swing a hammer or a pick-axe. -.-Motionsickness? Yes, unfortunately. I think the repetative tight corridors and looking around for clues is what did me in.Would I recommend this? Well... maybe. I don't know. Personally, if you want a game not as scary as Amnesia DD, then sure... but if you are really looking for loads of OH GOD MY HEART! then... I'd actually say skip it. o_o Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. it just wasn't great.I think maybe I will recommend if you're kind of looking for a horror game to quickly pass the time OR if you scare really easily. Just maybe get it on sale.Here is hoping Penumbra Black Plague will be scarier.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												May not be as scary as say Amnesia but this is one survival horror that you shouldn't miss. Its fun, challenging and very very creepy.Combat is difficult so you can't always rely on the ""weapons"" you get, which makes the game interesting because a game isn't a horror game if you can easily fight your way through all your enemies.

												This game is great, as long as you know what you're getting into.If you're looking for a plethora of things to kill and ways to kill them, this is not the game for you. The few ""weapons"" you encounter are tools that are used more for their intended purposes than they are for slaughter. Most of the time you're better off just running away from combat, as the tools don't do much damage anyway.The atmosphere and the creativity of this game make it an experience that differs from the norm, and this is the real reason to play it. The setting is very eerie and a nod to old survival horror games, placing more emphasis on survival than conflict. The sound effects can be very unsettling, and the ever-present snarls of the wild dogs send a chill up your spine. While not ""scary"" in the traditional sense, there are moments where the game will leave you with a distinct feeling of unease. The puzzles can be somewhat difficult at times, but you can't help but admire their creativity and thought-provoking nature. Notes and letters are more than just collectibles here. Many of them are vital to puzzle-solving and advancement, so make sure you read everything you encounter and pay close attention to clues.Considering you get both games in a $10.00 package, it's definitely a great value. Though if you don't mind waiting, I picked mine up during a sale for 50% less, which made it even more worthwhile.Admittedly, I have yet to finish the game. But I'm several hours in and I would already recommend it to those who enjoy a straight-up adventure game as opposed to the ever popular shoot-em-up. Looking forward to finishing this up and moving on to the follow-up, ""Black Plague"", which I'm told is even better.			",17,8,0,2,0,0,0

												Penumbra is absolutely astounding. Being the predecessor of Amnesia it beats the living CRAP out of it in all ways; atmosphere (seriously, crawling on your hands and knees with no weapons, dogs howling around you while you're losing your sanity is intense), music (there is none, which I love, it brings a whole new level to insufferable solitary) and the plot. The monsters in the game aren't the typical 'le slender face' either, just dogs, spiders and demons, the simplicity makes it even more terrifying and certainly plays on your fear of the unknown.

												Penumbra Overture is a great horror game that combines puzzle and first person elements to create a suspenseful atmosphere.  You must lead your character throughout an abandoned underground military base while thwarting the horrors that dwell there and discovering clues about your past.  This game is unique from others in the way it creates tension.  It is not so direct as other horror games, but I guarantee it will keep you on the edge of your seat.			",284,46,6,17,24,3,24

												It's the best one out of the Trilogy, that's for sure. The atmosphere is probably what will scare you the most, that and your own anxities about what could possible be waiting behined that locked door. The puzzles are enjoyable and somewhat challenging to solve, you must think outside the box to solve a couple of them. Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game and it scared me a couple times, which is hard to do.			",38,8,1,0,4,0,0

												The story itself is well organised and logic.The beginning may give an impression that it's quite a complicated game and may scare you the most. The idea of sets of corridors connecting different places is interesting when it comes to live but unless you want to keep dogs alive it becomes quite boring and may discourage players. Then comes the end which I was really impressed with. Parts where it's needed to think quickly make the game even more awesome, really. Overall it's a good experiance also for former Amnesia players looking for a similar game.			",9,2,0,0,2,0,0

												I have seen several let's plays of this game and now that I have played it myself I have realized a few things.-Compared to Amnesia: the Dark Descent the controls were a little sloppy (for me at least), if not, it was at least not the most efficient set up. (Now this isn't so much as a negative system, but it might be too efficient causing to no longer be efficient).-The only story of this game is: get through the mines. Now while you traverse the mines and caves you get hints at what the next game will hold. Red also explains what has happened and what is still happening. Now ... to actually get or say this has any plot to it: you have to read the notes, and listen to Red.-Another comparison to Amnesia: the Dark Descent is in this game you almost never have a time of absolute darkness to where you cannot see in front of you. -Although the puzzles were good and some were very easy; unless you have seen someone else, have maps of the game, or even have a walkthrough ... there are no initiatives for directions of how to work the puzzles (although Red does help a little it is very easy to miss his times of speech especially when being chased or if you are in hiding). There or the ""To Do""'s but unless you have clicked on something that requires reminding, it is very unhelpful/useless.-Now this game is the first commercially released game that Frictional Games has done and therefore deserves a high rating of amazement from an avid gamer to the company. I definitely recommend this game to others who are looking for a game to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm gonna be honest here. This was one of the first games I ever bought on Steam back in 2011. Being an idiot, I never really got past it. Well, I decided to sit down this weekend and try and actually finish it. Wasn't hard. I did it. Penumbra: Overture is a good game. As a horror game, eh...For someone who hasn't really played horror games all that much, this was a pretty ok start. Penumbra follows the adventures of a young man as he travels to Greenland upon his dead father's request. When he gets there, a storm hits and he is forced to take shelter in an old mine. Bad idea, as the mine has it's own little messed up histrory. Pros:-Interesting story-Decent graphics-Very atmospheric-Pretty ok puzzles (especially for people not good at them)Cons:-Not very scary when you can just kill the enemies...Really thats it. The enemies can be killed pretty easily and early on. It really kills the mood and prevents it from being a great horror gameRating: 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Captures the claustrophobic fear of being trapped and the madness that sets in during a gruesome struggle for survival. Fighting for your life feels clumsy and frantic at the same time: eventually I lost count of the number of zombie dogs I had wildly and desperately stabbed to death with a pickaxe. The sound design complements the atmosphere wonderfully and you will find your heart pounding in time with the ominous music before long.Puzzles are intelligent and interesting, sometimes requiring you to use your noodle to decipher codes from written clues or learn how to do something from a field manual rather than simply ""use item A on object B"".A little difficult and confusing at points but definitely worth a playthrough!

												The Penumbra series was Frictional Games first series. Overture is the first game in the penumbra series, it features Phillip who is investigating a letter written from his dead father and ends up trapped in an abandoned mine. The game revolves around surviving and hiding, there are no real fighting mechanisms in the game. You can throw rocks or objects to knock out enemies (Dogs, Spiders, Infected) but after a while they will get back up again and attack you. This is a very puzzle heavy survival game, reading and taking notes are important but also some sounds can lead to become very important clues for some places. If you enjoyed Penumbra and haven't checked out Frictional games second series Amnesia, I would highly recommend it.			",343,62,0,39,13,3,23

												This Game is great for the price of $10 and the fact it comes with the games in the series is great. As for the Horror Survival part of the game is geat how if you don't feel like hiding you can walk up to an enemy and BEAT THEâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥OUT OF HIM WITH A PICKAXE. Great story though the horror is Ok because he pretty much tells you that something is comming.			",83,5,0,13,9,0,15

												To start: I used to add a longer header describing my reviewing ethos, but it made some reviews too long to submit, so I've left it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: Odds are that if you're looking at this game, you've played the Amnesia games. They're pretty much one and the same, these series. In fact, there's such a high probability that you've played Amesia or at least seen Amnesia that I'm not going to bother going into too much depth as far as the gameplay goes. Instead, I'll just keep things shorter and compare and contrast the two. For starters, both games have an emphasis on hiding from enemies, since combat is kinda spotty at best. However, that's by design, so there's not much point whinging about that. Unlike Amnesia, you don't have to worry about sanity. The screen just goes all wibbly whenever you look at the enemy. All in all, there's three things you've gotta worry about: puppies, carnivorous spiders, and the worm. The puppies will patrol the area, but you can distract them with bits of beef jerky... sometimes. It doesn't work all the time, though; even if you've got a whole pile of jerky in front of the dog. The other two you just run away from.Puzzles are, again, very akin to Amnesia. There were a few puzzles that were kinda annoying or suffered from 90's Adventure Syndrome, but they're generally pretty alright. You can brute force a few puzzles; a favorite solution to one where you have to knock down a ladder is to build a tower of barrels. Yes, that works. I'm still surprised that it works. There wasn't really anything that blew me away as far as clever puzzle design, though. It's just pretty run of the mill puzzle design.As far as the atmosphere goes, Amesia wins by a LONG shot. There really weren't any gripping moments for me in this game. It's not bad, and to someone who's more susceptible to horror than I am, it might be quite a thrill. However, the game didn't grab me in the same way that Amnesia did. Then again, this is the first episode of the Penumbra series; maybe Black Plague can step it up a few notches. 6/10.Story: It's a pretty typical supernatural-based story. I can tell a lot of the questions the game brought up (that I didn't find myself asking, actually; the game kinda shoved the questions down my throat) are gonna be answered in later installments, but for just the first game, I didn't find myself really caring all that much. Red should have been a lot creepier of a character, but he was more of an annoyance than anything else. At the end, I didn't feel pity; I just felt relief that I wouldn't have to hear his stereotypical rambling. Also, just because your game is episodic, that doesn't mean that you've gotta have a cliffhanger. It only works if you're really invested in the series. Otherwise, it just seems silly. Oh well; at least they got better at writing by Amnesia. 5/10.Graphics: I'm quite impressed that they were able to do this much in only a ~300MB download. All of the textures look pretty good, the worlds are pretty well made, and everything just looks pretty good. Too bad that the mine environment didn't allow for much on the art style front. Enemies aren't really too interesting art design-wise, either. Certainly nothing as discomforting as Mr. No-Jaw-McGee. It does get kinda boring looking at mine section after mine section after mine section, but I guess that couldn't be helped. The game will run at 1080p easily, and I'd imagine that if you have any graphics card whatsoever, you should be able to run this game without any problems. For a fair bit of technical finesse from an indie team with an unfortunately lacking art direction, I'll give it a 3/5.Sound: Frictional has always been pretty good at sound design. While this isn't their best example of sound design capabilities, it is still a good show. It does get a bit silly and overdone at times, but for the most part, it does a pretty good job at setting the atmosphere. As far as the voice actor (singular; Red is pretty much the only one), it wasn't bad. It's only bad  that his dialogue made me get rather tired of him fast. As far as the music, there really isn't much. It does set the mood, though, so I guess there's that. 4/5.Overall scores are: 6/5/3/4; cumulative score of 5.7/10. Overall a pretty middling surivival horror game. Hopefully Black Plague picks up the pace.			",508,69,16,41,32,3,65

												This is the scariest game I have ever played. Seriosly it does everything so well: the atmosphere (including background audio), the story (including the felling of absolute loneliness while still having very interesting NPC), the setting (sooo claustrophobic), the puzzles (often based on physics) and so on. The only gripe I've got is the terrible fighting mechanic; which they luckily abandoned in future installments.			",245,60,16,14,9,4,18

												Penumbra Overture is a pretty darned cool game. Frictional games, creators of the critically acclaimed Amnesia: The Dark Descent made this Penumbra a few years before ATDD, and it doesn't disappoint!Scary atmosphere, and compelling scriptwriting make it a joy to play. The plot isn't particularly believable, but which horror game plot is nowadays. The controls feel a little clunky at times, and the combat system (which was thankfully done away with in Penumbra: Black Plague) is entirely optional, meaning you can attempt stealth playthroughs of the game.Grab the collection if its on sale, its worth the price!8/10!

												This was the first game that introduced me to the works of the  great small company named Frictional Games. And as it often happens with ""first""s - it's the most impressive horror game for me. When I play it now - I have a huge feeling of nostalgia.The plot is great. Mystery of the father's letter, the idea of a small man trapped inside an unknown bunker in the middle of nowhere, the enormous size of that underground construction... this is all very intriguing! In this game a lot of experiences were concentrated together. At first, it was like reading a very interesting fantastic book. At second, it was very immersive experience of being trapped in this bunker where the only way out is to go deeper into the unknown. At third it was innovative system of the interaction with ingame objects, where your mouse (and so your hand) becomes your virtual hand. Forth - it was a real true horror game, where scary things are made not of sudden flashes or jump-out monsters, but horror of the atmosphere, vulnerability and loneliness. Fifth - a lot of physical objects that you need to interact with, made the game even more immersive, because you see less scripting and more like simulation of virtual world. There was also a great musical theme in menu that touched me when I first launched the game.As a verdict I can say that this game is at the top of experience of all games I played.If I hadn't play this game I'd missed a lot in my life. Usually a lot of games for me is just a waste of time, and I wouldn't regret if I had never played them, but definitely not this one.			",121,50,4,3,11,0,2

												It's good and pretty scary, until you find out how easily you can kill all the dogs and bypass all the threats. It's essentially a survival horror stealth game with one of the most clunkiest inefficient combat systems out there that is purposely bad to make you feel utterly hopeless. A great idea to drive the horror with poor combat, sort of like how Resident Evil took use of the bad camera angles to gimp and make the characters have a weakness. However, poorly executed, could be way better if the combat is scrapped entirely or gimped even more.Ignoring all the flaws, it's still a very good horror game.			",173,36,3,19,2,0,4

												Great episodic series.  I've only played Overture so far but I can safely say that spiders were never so menacing in a game before!  The sound design and graphics are quite good and the story is compelling enough to keep making you want to play it; delve ever deeper (literally) into the mine that the first part of this series (Overture) almost entirely takes place in.   Also, the puzzles and game play mechanics (such as being able to smash open a locked chest or closed door with a hammer or pick + having a glow stick, a flashlight, and even flares at your disposal to light your way, are all great features as well)Can't wait to play the rest of the series!

												Pretty decent game here.  Survival horror game where you use your brain to think of ways to progress through the levels/areas opposed to the mindless shooting crap with a gun while running around type of horror games out there.  Not very much intense action involved in this game, which makes you slow down and concentrate and look for things while being creeped out by the strange atmospheric sounds and visual surroundings.  This game is best played in the dark with sound up,  all makes the experience much better.  The game is rather short, beat in in about 4 or 5 hour, but for what you pay to get this game makes it all worth it.  A title I suggest my friends to pick up if you dont mind getting spooked.Raiting: 7/10			",461,100,19,63,58,7,70

												Downloaded this game (and it's sequels) in preparation for Amnesia. A good game, (if a little short) atmospheric, puzzles can be a little irritating, but satisfactory once solved. However, combat is plonky and players should stick to stealth, I also noticed that health regenerates (I was playing on easy) I never died in the one instance of accidental direct combat. Other minor complaints are that when I started the game up I had to tinker with the graphics just get some colour and clear picture.All in all, enjoyable experience.

												Terror lurks behind every corner...in the form of dogs and spiders.  Seriously, the only enemies in this game are dogs and spiders.  The puzzles and story are okay, but really, this game is only worth playing so you can get the first part of the story to the amazing Penumber Black Plague.			",298,88,1,79,20,2,22

												Alright so Penumbra is Pretty scary even if you set your Brightness to high because it uses Horror Noises and Scares to Scare theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of the Player. It's Very good but not the kind of game i would play often because you can not defend yourself very well in this game and the Other two, Black Plague and Requiem you arent able to defend yourself at all.

												After completeing this title a little over 5 months ago (After putting it off for a long time) --- I can quite honestly say: if you haven't played it, please do... Being the same developer, it is the direct spiritual predeccesor of Amnesia and, quite frankly, brought Amnesia to it's success. Without the technology developed from this small series, we wouldn't be experiencing the horrifying, dark, immersive 3D experience that we know today. This game never got that much credit, where much credit is due. I would LOVE to live to the day where survival horror saw more games akin to this. If you REALLY want the pants scared off of you - I'd highly recommend it's successor - Black Plague. 10$, you can't beat that price for such a beautifully crafted masterpiece.			",40,4,0,8,4,0,3

												Never thought I would be this scared.Also have equal amount of frustration.First time playing a Frictional game, spent 40 minutes, still can't get the hang of any of the controls, and not a single enemy has spawned yet. I literally died twice because i couldn't turn the damn wheel. #noobof2015Thinking of I should even continue, my brain legit hurts after playing this 1 time.Horror fans or picking a horror game for the first time?Try this it's worth the shock.Should I even try Amnesia, I have zero idea, some say this is still the scariest production out of all Frictional Games.

												The atmosphere might be laking (in comparison to Amnesia) and you might be able to defend yourself in this one but the story is a lot better in there than in Amnesia, Red is a cool dude!			",42,10,1,9,1,0,2

												Creepy little crawler.  Story keeps you intrigued, but the ending is a let down.  3/5 slugs.			",95,17,0,9,1,1,2
