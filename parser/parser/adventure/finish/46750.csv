												First off, only get this game on sale. Even though I recommend it, I don't for $13. It's more of a under $5 game. Also if you are looking for a really creepy game that keeps you on your toes, and/or have balls of steel, then this game might not be for you. This game has a few good jump scares but for the most part you end up losing the fear until the jump scare puts you back into it. And if you are pretty comfy with most horror games then the jump scares will make you jump a bit then be like ""Meh."" Finally, if you want a 'simple' game that is easy to play, then this isn't for you either. The puzzles are hard and for most of the game me and my friend had a guide we would go to every time we couldn't figure what to do. With all the said, Me and my friend enjoyed the game. The surroundings were spooking, the story was interesting. Hell the main reason we didn't want to stop was because we wanted to figure things out. Why was he there? What were those statue? The Voice acting is pretty bad though, I remember asking my friend if they just pulled some guy off the coding crew to voice the main character. I think that might be my biggest complaint, that the voice acting was horrible. It really pulled you out of the game whenever they spoke, especially the main character. But I've dealt with worse. If you are easily creeped out and good at puzzle games, I recommend the game. If you are more into being chased and always having to be on your toes, then maybe you should go look somewhere else.

												Have you ever wondered what would happen if you fused Dark Fall and Silent Hill together? I'll tell you what happens: you get Lost Souls, the creepiest game by far in the Dark Fall series. What a game. What a finish.Where do I even begin, since it's all great? I love the look of this game. You can tell Jonathan Boakes definitely had a bigger budget to play with since this game moves away from the Myst like feel, and more towards 360 degree surroundings, in which your character turns, sweeping the surroundings around him, instead of slide images. Time has not been kind to the Dowerton Station and Hotel. In Dark Fall 1, the train station is unsettling, but still just an empty, abandoned train station. In DF: LS, Dowerton has turned into a hell hole - a place where vandalism, illicit activity, and even satanic activity have become commonplace. The train station and hotel is beautifully rendered, yet is visually disturbing. This game does not bank on jump scares, though I was suprised a couple times. The scares come from knowing that you are exploring an evil place. The story is fairly simple and very reminiscent of a Silent Hill kind of story. You are an Inspector who failed to apprehend the kidnapper/murderer of a young girl named Amy. She was last seen at the train station. Your guilt and shame lead you to return to the station and hopefully find her and bring about closure. As you explore, you meet other ghosts who for some reason or other are also trapped in the hotel. Because you are such a nice inspector, you help these lost souls find their way so they can move on. Each ghost you help gives you a key that will be useful. What I love about this section is that you are able to jump back in time to 1947, seeing the hotel at its peak. It makes returning to the present all the more horrifying as you see the decay of the place.Just like the previous Dark Fall games, the use of sound is great. With visuals and sound creating an eerie, disturbing world, this is a game that would definitely be one to play in the dark with a good set of headphones.So, good basic story, good visuals and sound, what about the puzzles? They are by far the easiest puzzles in the Dark Fall series. Yes, you will still read a lot and you will need to take notes, but I feel that the puzzles are a lot more intuitive than the previous games. There are three floors to the Hotel, and each one serves as a kind of level. The Train Station itself serves as a level. Within each level, there are puzzles that are meant for just that area. To me, that makes this game a lot easier, unlike Dark Fall: The Journal where you just jump in and have no idea what the first objective is.Speaking of learning objectives, your character has a cell phone! Throughout the game, you will receive texts that will give hints to where you should go, and the next mission. It will also serve as filling in parts of the story.This game was a fitting conclusion to the Dark Fall series. I enjoyed revisiting the Dowerton Station and Hotel. It has really made me curious and excited to look at other games made by Jonathan Boakes. If you like ghost stories, you owe it to yourself to try the Dark Fall series. ",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

												Dark Fall, Lost Souls is the third game in the Dark Fall series by Jonathan Boakes of Darkling Room. It is not necessary to have played the earlier games (The Journal, Lights Out) but I'm sure that once you've played Lost Souls you will want to see what else Darkling Room has to offer. This game is creepy as all hell!You play as The Inspector - an ex police inspector who, several years before, investigated the disappearance of a young girl called Amy in the town of Dowerton. She was never found. You are back at Dowerton Railway Station and the Station Hotel, which are now in total disrepair due to them being abandoned shortly after Amy's disappearance. It is bonfire night and fireworks light up the sky above the eerie night-time setting. It soon becomes clear that some bad things have happened here. There are many lost souls - some good, some evil, lurking in the shadows. Some want to harm you but others need your help. You will be transported to times past in order to understand all the events that have taken place and to finally find your own fate. This is no ordinary place though. Jonathan Boakes, the creator, has surpassed himself in creating a world which is familiar enough to make you feel at home, yet weird enough to make it a very unsettling and scary place indeed.

I cannot praise Lost Souls enough. The graphics, navigation, music, sound effects, gameplay, puzzles - all are of an excellent quality and take 'point and click' adventures on to a whole new level.			",16,50,0,7,0,0,0

												I played this game before the other two and I loved it...so I bought those and will be playing this again.  This game is a nonlinear horror that had me tense all the time and scared a lot of the time.  Though the game is nonlinear, there are some things that need done before you can move on.  Sometimes, what needs to be done is not obvious so you pretty much have to go around and try different things until you can move on.  There is a quite wonderful guide on Steam (I'm sorry I don't remember the name of the one who made it, but qudos to you).  This is definately not a game for children.  The game has two endings and several very interesting easter eggs about hauntings and weird happenings around the area of the game.  I really liked that and looked to collect them all.  Some of the mechanics of the game are a little hard to work with (like moving things), but keep trying and some of the puzzles (like ""conversations with..."") were downright frustrating.  All in all, even though I needed some help, I had a great time.  Thanks to the devs and all for a great scare, and another and another....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6/10A bit of a 'meh' game, really.  If Steam had the option for a middle spot between recommend and don't recommend, I'd choose it.  It had its moments, some of the puzzles were good and much of the story was okay as well, but nothing really shone.  Some confusing UI.  Some horrible voice acting (and some okay).  Some cheesy horror aspects.  No ability to skip repetitive dialog or animations.  Quite linear, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but there are some obtuse prerequisites to move the story along at times.  For instance, you're in a room, do everything you can...and move on.  Explore some other area, do all you can...then get stuck.  Well if you then go back to the first area, something will have changed for some reason...triggered by something else you did but for no apparent reason.But overall, it just didn't grip me enough to make me want to work through things...or I would just assume something illogical was going on even if in the end it just might have just taken a little more scrutiny...but time I didn't feel like spending on it.In the end, it was good enough that I at least was willing to finish it.  I got it on a 75% Steam sale, so I can't complain.  If you like horror/spooky and maybe have an interest in the occult, it might grip you more than it did me and you can overlook some of its flaws.

												Coming from the first two Dark Fall games this one was a huge disappointment. I miss the ghost-hunting and the eerie historical Cornwall vibe I got from the previous games. Even though this takes place in the Station Hotel, it doesn't feel like the same setting as the first game.Lost Souls relies way too heavily on boring, over-used tropes from the modern horror genre:Creepy little girl? Check.Scribbles on the walls? Check.Old hospital paraphernalia? Check.Scary dolls and mannequins? Check.Random gore? Check.Nonsensical jump scares? Check, check, check, and check.Definitely play the first two Dark Fall games (and the Lost Crown games from the same dev), but I say pass on this one unless you get it at a huge discount.

												I wanna start out by saying I LOVE old school point and clicks, and the first 2 dark fall games were amazing to me, story, gameplay, environments, etc. They had everything I look for in an adventure game. I cannot say the same for Dark Fall: Lost Souls. It feels like they just handed the location setting to a completely random team, and said ""make a ghost story!"" The story is cliche and forgettable. The first 2 titles in the series had very original, deep plotlines that I loved delving into. The lore was awesome, and traveling to different time periods was essential AND fascinating. In Lost Souls, the story is about a ghost girl that is haunting a haunted place. That's literally it. The depth of ""malakai"" from 2, or the intrigue of the well are completely gone from Lost Souls, and replaced with a snotty-spoiled ghost-child wearing pig tails. A huge let down.The environments are a GREAT improvment! This game looks amazing compared to the first entries, however it's a huge shame that the improved graphics isn't met with better game design. Instead of being afraid of the story, you will be afraid of the graphics, if you're afraid at all. Something will jump on the screen, you won't find any notes in this game that give you chills to simply read. And I found that to be a huge let down. Another thing that really bothered me was the padding. It wasn't the content that was padded, but the controls and gameplay itself. It takes a FULL SECOND to just turn your character in a single direction. This sounds negligible, but when you're trying to figure out where to go all of a sudden you realize you've been in the same hallway for nearly 2 minutes doing literally nothing but trying to orientate your character. The game (for no real reason) also allows you to ""look"" up/down on every single screen. Despite how this is only used once or twice in puzzles or story exploration, it's ultimately just a trap to spend MORE time looking around slowly and accomplishing nothing. I know my account shows nearly 30 hours of gameplayâ€”I assure you that is not because I loved it OR because it's that long! I literally fell asleep multiple times playing this game. How uninteresting the story is, how much nothing seems to actually fit into anything, how slow it is to even MOVE, all add up to an incredibly dull game. The most successful thing this game did, was put me to sleep.EDIT: If you're still reading and want another example of how watered down bad this is compared to the first 2, you remember the ""over here!"" or ""here!"" voice mechanics in 1 and 2? That were creepy to hear cuz it meant something creepy was happening? In this game, when you hear ""Over here!"" it means ""HEY TURN YOUR FLASHLIGHT ON, YOU CAN'T SEE!"". That's all. It only happens when you need your flashlight out. Because not being able to see wasn't hint enough? Completely ruined a creepy mechanic.TL;DRAs a standalone game, it's better than most other point and clicks, but still forgettable 6/10As a sequel to Dark Fall 1 & 2, it's an utter disappointment 3/10.Just play 1 or 2 again, is what I recommend.

Lucky for you, you have a bottle of vodka, a handful of Clozapine and a helpful buddy with a serious texting habit. Your adventure is celebrated by the town by putting on a fireworks display in your honor but can you avoid the spooky skeletons and delerium tremens long enough to yank the mask off old man Withers? Excellent ambiance, Don't play alone alone in the dark. Bottle of vodka reccomended for player as well as character.			",196,49,3,29,12,1,27

												There is nothing like good horror game and this is one of the best I've played. This third instalment in ""Dark Fall"" -trilogy provides interesting storyline and most of the puzzles are logical. Some players might be annoyed with moving mechanics which are out of date, but this did not drive me off. (horror almost did :) )One of the brightest pearls in small lake of horror games; check the 2 prior Dark Falls too and note that all 3 games have independent stories.			",203,89,1,24,10,0,6

												Fantastic addition to the series. IF you like point and click horror games, Lost Souls is perfect. The more time you spend looking, the faster the game goes and the better it gets. This isn't a game for the impatient, but if you get frustrated you can always find a walkthrough. Pros: -Atmosphere is perfect, you're often wondering who put the poop in your pants.-Fun and challenging puzzles, you really have to use your brain. -More versatile with angles compared to the first game.Cons: -A few bugs, mainly for me when I was piecing together a ripped up picture it would freeze. -The lockpicking was irritating.

												Bought it because I liked the art and design elements in the game, but just because a game looks nice doesn't mean it is. This point-and-click game turned out to be terrible. I completed it just so I have it completed rather than leave it unfinished. It was brutal, especially since he took my hours to even try to figure out the very beginning untill I looked online for a game Guide. Yeah, there were odd scarey bits, but nothing that made up for the slow and boring gameplay and storyline, which frequently deviated to sub-story events and the search for items to progress through them, then going back to continue on your main path to collect more items, solve more puzzles, many of which you have no idea how they even tie in. Most of, if not all, the items you collect are very obscure and sometimes seem thrown in with no explanation as well as the puzzle's lack of hints as to where completion items can be found. This game actually gave me a headache and just so I knew where to go next and where to get the puzzle pieces, I played this game by way of a game step-by-step guide after spending 20 minutes stuck on one side story puzzle.NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a person who enjoyed what I managed to play of the old ""Dark Fall"" (before it became incompatible with my operating system), it was a real novelty to go back to Dowerton Station and re-experience interaction with some of the more memorable characters from the first game -- and ultimately bring closure to the wandering ghosts.The story is fairly mediocre and predictable this time (it also fails to explain what the ""Dark Fall"" is, which will confuse any who hadn't played the first two games), but what was outstanding about the first ""Dark Fall"" carries over into this one. The puzzles are clever, original and solvable. There is plenty of exploration and the environments are very well rendered (granted, it takes you forever to move from place to place). The game provides a few really effective scares (only 2-3 jump scares), and a tense atmosphere. There is also enough surrealism to make any survival horror veteran uneasy.By far, the best part of this game is the sheer amount of time you spend scissoring things. I don't think I've ever used so many pairs of scissors so many times and so consistently in an adventure game. I personally feel the scissoring makes up for most of the very bad plot devices. Completely.All in all: Don't play for the story. Play it for the puzzles. Stay for the scissoring.			",133,113,2,17,13,2,11

												So maybe like me, you come across this game called Dark Fall: Lost Souls, you watched the trailer for it and it seems to be at least a somewhat interesting if not at least somewhat engaging plot of mystery, and you then noticed that the game is at a fairly cheap price and you'll give it a whirl. But before you play it on your steam, you decide to check the overall user reviews on the game and find that(at this time) this game is 'Mixed'. Half liked it and the other don't so read through it and see that you'll jsut have to find out for yourself which side of the mixed reviews you'll be on. About 2 hrs of playing, confusion, looking up guides, and snoring. You might find that this game is a total piece of suck from a duck with trucks mucking around in poo and that now you're on the negative side of the mixed reviews and wonder why the flippin burger gurgers that anyone even remotely likes this stupid, boring, hyptic game. I know I only played 2 hours at the time fo this review, but it's just so boring. Alright review portion; I bought this game on sale thank gerd, in hopes of having fun with a good horror mystery game. What I soon found minutes into the game IN THE FIRST AREA is that I had to look up a guide on what to do. Warning lights flashed and foreshadowed what I'll be doing later and constantly in the future of this game(Which I did).   Back pedal a bit, the options in this game is unbelievably pathetic, no window mode, no audio adjust, just difficulty and subtitles.(Which on that note I might need to play the game on a lower difficulty to see if it actually plays better as it defaults to hard). Anyways the game is not clear and is never quite clear on what you can do in this game as that's how I got stuck on the first 'puzzle' because it went against everything I knew about the point n clicks I played. I'd spoil it but then you wouldn't know the frustration of finding out how this dumb game and it's mechanics work. This game has mechanics that just make everything you do a chore and makes the game unnessacarily slow and difficult by having crucial items you need at your feet out of view that you had to look down at, at specifical points. Oh and there's no 'examine area' where most point n click characters would make a comment about something like say for instance clicking on a dark area would make them say 'It's too dark here, if only I had some light to see' to give you a clue of what to do.  Speaking of voice your main character's voice causes heart attacks because it's just one of the most cringe worthy british accents I ever heard. It sounds like Pete form Disney is choking on something while trying to speak in a british voice. it's terrible and I could have done a better accent. Music is also quite grinding to listen to as it just keep repeating itself and gets dull. I started falling asleep as I try to figure out the bizzare hyptic puzzles the game wants you to figure out and I swear they don't give you enough clear hints on how to solve them and that the creators are out of their freaking minds when making these dumb puzzles. I want Virtue's Last Reward Puzzles Quality! Not this bullcrap. You got clues that are loosely connected and then the whole somewhat pixel hunting to find items you'll need the puzzles in this game is just crap and thinking about it will just ruin another set of brain cells that could have lived longer for a better purpose. You WILL be looking at a walkthrough to find out how the fudge you're suppose to make progress because it lacks any logic at all. Oh and don't get me started on the horror aspect of this game, it has creepy areas to be in but the scares themselve so far have been â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The ghost are laughable harry potter ghosts, and the scares are cheap jumpscares that are not impressive at all and didn't even wake me up as I yawned. Should have named the game Dark Fail: Lost Cause. cause I just don't want to keep playing after 2 hrs and there's 8 parts to this and fudge that noise, just go watch some poor sod playing through this game or some playthrough of some poor sod who went through it. As if the game isn't bad enough you have the whole mixed reviews with people who actually like this game. Well more power to those but they would have to be crazy to like this maddening game. It's like the game Anna if it was slower, more hyptic, and less logic. Oh and this is obvious but never ever listen to the review scores in the trailer because they knew this game is bad and had to find some way to convince people to buy it. Believe the negative reviews not the positive ones because I'm positive they just used a guide and never thought for a second how hyptic the puzzles are and believe the game is good. The graphics are the only thing worth praising as it looks like a location from a resident evil game and is quite nice.Whatever I paid for this game I want my money back.			",265,93,2,28,12,3,20

												This game does well to create atmosphere, the imagery is hauntingly beautiful  (apart from character models and some items) and the sound design is spot on, unfortunately the immersion is ruined a little due to this frustratingly slow and clunky way in which you move around and interact with things. There is a lot of puzzles and most of them are really nice, but the controls can be awkward to use and some puzzles are pretty difficult or annoying because there doesn't seem to be any clues as to what you should do. The game's story is convoluted and I don't really learn much from it, I'm not sure if this is intended so that the player can interpret things, but I was left pretty confused. The ending is also very anti-climatic, there are two endings and they are pretty much the same and they are both very clichÃ© endings. Despite the negatives, I do recommend this game but probably not at full price. You'll like it if you like the more subtle genre of horror (Silent Hill-esque), point & click games, lots of puzzles and searching of items. Also if you don't mind slow and clunky controls for both puzzles and moving around and interacting with things in general you'd like this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lost Souls revists the same haunted hotel of the first game, but with an entirely new storyline, and is far more frightening than the first!  Even if you disliked any of their prior games, I'd still recommend giving this one a shot. No need to have played the other games to enjoy this one~The only true downside to this game is it can often be difficult to know what the next task is, however, the improvement between this game and the first is that this game will often guide you in the right direction. The game has interesting bonus items, so if you're interested, use a game guide, as there's no way to get clues to figure out the way to get them on your own.This game has a number of jump scares, so if you're against those, I wouldn't recommend it.  But at the same time, it wasn't reliant on them.All in all, an enjoyable game!			",41,70,0,17,15,0,2

												A cop on the go to solve the mystery of little Amy who disappeared in the old train station of Dowerton. Amy... such a generic ""little-girl-who-disappeared"" kinda name. Who names their kid like that? It's predestined to disappear. Anyway, the game provides a horror atmosphere that really crawls under your skin. The limited movement ability only increases the fear of something being behind you. As nice as all this is, the difficult nature of the game with puzzles that require more items than necessary and having to search so many places multiple times is ruining the fun. Best you can do is to get a solution and just enjoy it like a halfâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥movie. Good story, mediocre game.			",242,86,2,25,11,3,10

												While I recommend this game overall, unfortunately it is a huge step back from The Lost Crown and the previous two Dark Fall titles in a number of ways. While it is most similar to the first Dark Fall: The Journal in both tone and setting, with of course being a graphical leap over the original, it lacks the series and its spin off's(The Lost Crown) rich lore, notably in its lack of virtually any supporting flavor text which added so much to the series aside from scattered newspaper clippings. The other titles all had a novel's worth of extra materials that added to the stories. What's left is a point and click stumble through a rehash of the Dowerton Train Station and Hotel that we already explored long ago. And with the cumbersome method of panning and up and down, a very tedious stumble at that. Several times now I've had to check a guide on where I went wrong only to find I didn't pan up at one overly specific spot. In addition the Penumbra/Amnesia style mouse interaction with some puzzles is clunky to say the least, and not even casually hinted at. It can be quite difficult to intuit where exactly you are supposed to move the stupid mouse to get a reaction, or you find yourself clicking things to no avail only to find you were supposed to drag them to the side(spark plugs...) despite it not really making sense to do so.Putting aside these design and technical issues, the game still stands as a great little horror adventure title to play through. It is atmospheric and has a few nice jump scare scenes and a continuation of the Dark Fall storyline is always a good thing.			",410,297,7,74,40,4,92

												This game picks up from Darkfall 1, which I thoroughly enjoyed  - it's a bit different though. I liked the revisit of the old locations, its was different but familar. The story starts off well but (for me) it fell apart after the half way point and I ended up getting lost on many an occasion (had to consult the walkthrough). The voiceover is quite funny too, sounds like Peter Serafinowicz on a bad day. This game can be glitchy and frustrating but I perservered because the story was quite interesting. It's worth a (cheap) look if you have played Darkfall 1.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, that's an interesting game, the enviroment is very good, graphics are really nice. The story is nice as well but the gameplay is very fuzzy. I mean, there's a lot of good ideas in this game (grabbing something with the mouse button and shaking the mouse to interact with the objects is a wonderful idea of interaction), but this game could call more attention on steam if the developer suited this point & click to a new game engine like Blender for exemple. It could be like Myst IV interaction (the players can see the scenery just moving the mouse to the corners of the screen) but with the same ideas of the dark fall's iinteraction. The other problem is: some puzzles are not well explained. I had to search on youtube about how to solve 3 or 4 puzzles, and that's not a good thing to do in a poin&click game. So my conclusion is: Dark Fall Lost Souls was a really great game in 2009, but nowdays it is just a nice game. I have 100% of sure that this game could be soo much better if the developer released a new version using a new engine.			",27,147,0,4,6,0,1

												This game is very spooky and certainly an interesting play. It is a sequel to Dark Fall: The Journal, which in turn is based upon an episode of an old British sci-fi show called Sapphire and Steel. The game is somewhat restricted as you can only move on certain paths, but the atmosphere and the puzzles can keep you guessing for hours, specially as you penetrate deeper into the ruined railway hotel and make your way upstairs to confront the evil that infests the place. And not all evil things are darkness and shadows...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To sum up i'd say that iits a great value for money, and a must for all the fans of horror adventure games.			",2,19,0,5,0,0,3

												It is hard to write a review on this game, because on the one hand we have a lot of good puzzles, great visuals and not bad sound effects. On the other hand we have terrible voice acting, a few stupid puzzles like a ""go somewhere, where you have already been and search every screen for something"" and the most important, let's say ""not the best ending"". So, we have not a bad game, but it's still a little worse than the 1st and 2nd chapters.

												Basically a Myst-style slideshow find the item use the item game... it's just not really that good.Pretty much everything about this game is either not good, or hasn't aged well.Either games have come a long way in three years or this game was never that good to begin with.I personally picked up this title because I thought maybe it was similar to games like Anna, Amnesia, Penumbra, or Outlast, but I was sorely mistaken.That said, I actually like games like Myst and its sequels... but those are good games, with good graphics that age well, with storylines that at least give you some backstory and motivation. Effects and music that draw you into the game.Lost Souls just is no good on any of those fronts.It's not a terrible game... just horribly mediocre. If you absolutely adore these types of games, try to wait for it at 80% or more on sale. I think I paid 5 bucks and its my first steam purchase in a long long time that I'm regreting.

												I played Dark Fall: Lost Souls for about 4 hours, although letting it open while I was AFK caused Steam to think I had about 56 hours of gameplay. I absolutely love horror graphic adventures and I can objectively say this game is terrible.The gameplay is very tedious, walking and turning around are slow actions, and you get stuck in the game without any signs of what you should do next very often, which wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take you years to go from point A to point B and explore it. Textures and animations lack details and make the game look older than it really is. The overall atmosphere is pretty good, but in the end the only really scary parts are just cheap scare jumps (really cheap, literally just an image appearing and the music going loud for a second).The story reuses a lot of elements from Dark Fall: The Journal, and it's not bad, although the endings are incredibly disappointing (there are two, they only depend on a line in the final dialogue).The worst thing about this game is the voice acting. It is AWFUL, most of the time lacking emotion or, on the contrary, sounding too forced. It kind of reminded me to the voice acting in Resident Evil 1, but I would choose RE1's any time.I bought this game 75% off and I would undo it. I wouldn't even try it if it was free.

												This game follows on from Dark Fall 1: The Journal; it is set in the same hotel and you meet some of the same characters although there is no need to have played the first one to understand this one (there is also a 2nd one - Lights out - but that one is a lot less scary and is set somewhere different); Lost Souls happily stands alone. You are a detective bent on solving the disappearance of a girl called Amy. It turns out later that this has become an obsession that has made you a bit crazy. But the main part of the game consists of exploring the old Station Hotel, which has become hideously warped and messed up since it is possessed by a creepy supernatural evil called the Dark Fall (you know this from the earlier games). There is also the ghost of the girl you are searching for and other souls trapped in the hotel that you can free.The thing about this game is that its really really scary, so much so that I only finished it for the sake of finishing it and used the walkthrough to get it done as soon as possible. I usually love Jonathan Boakes' games who is  a master of creepy adventure games; he is one of my favourite game creators ever (especially The Lost Crown; you should totally play that if you're vaguely interested in this). Chiefly, the decor of the hotel is terrifying; aside from blood smears everywhere, the corridors are dark, there are incredibly creepy mannequins everywhere and the scissor collections still haunt me (a bed stabbed dozens of times, and a wall equally covered in scissors in the room of a doomed soul - although artsy, its just horrible). I set this game apart from Boakes' other creations because it steps over a line the others didn't cross. For one thing, there is blood, and quite a lot of it. There's still no all-out violence which is good; I think that would make me turn away from Boakes forever. But the blood is mainly just gross and indicative of brutality. There are also weird bloody writhing creatures that you have to kill with scissors which is also gross and just unpleasant. Then there is threat of actual violence being done to your player character; I have not seen this before in his games and it was horrible. I am referring to one scene in the game where a ridiculously creepy creature is cowering in the corner but moves towards you as the light flickers. You have until it reaches you to solve a little puzzle which isn't difficult but the enormity of stress that I felt made it so bad. If you fail to solve it in time the scene changes to you being defibrilatored in hospital and you have to try again.When I first loaded into the game the first thing I noticed which was different were the controls; you can look in for directions all around you as well as above and below each direction. You also swivel to change view rather than blocking from one frame to another. This immediately changes the way you feel about looking another way; it takes time, which builds suspense and, in my case, dread. It slows the game down considerably, especially when you find you went the wrong way or are not sure where to head next. This makes it frustrating as well. It is also hard to follow. Without the walkthrough I would have given up way earlier. Another irritation is that you can't actually explore that much of the hotel; the number of rooms available to look in is very limited which is kindof annoying for me since I really enjoyed the freedom to enter every room in the hotel in the first game. However, since the parts of the hotel you can see are so terrifying I'm ok with not seeing more of it. I'd have just preferred a game based on mystery rather than shock and horror, like the first ones. It wasn't all bad though; there are some scenes which transport you back in time where you have to solve some puzzles to free someone's soul. These are very nice; mainly because they remove you from the horrible deformed hotel you arrived in, and the puzzles are quite nice, although irritatingly repetitive if you get them wrong the first time. Overall however I'm going to uninstall this and pretend it never happened and hope the nightmares go away...			",20,49,0,3,3,0,6

												A Myst like pre-rendered first person adventure, Dark Souls makes a stab at the horror genre and misses by a fair margin. It throws in some naff horror tropes but is never scary, the story is unspectacular, the voice acting is poor and it all looks like a game much older than the 2010 release date would suggest. Worst of all is that snailâ€™s pace of the game. Even for a point and click adventure, things here are painfully slow, click to look up and the camera slooowwwly pans up, want to look at something in detail and you sloooowwwly zoom in. It feels like the camera canâ€™t really be bothered and makes for an infuriating experience as you scour screens looking for puzzle item. Dark Fall represents a relic of gaming that really should have been left in the past.  ",669,204,30,92,73,10,138

One card in nearly four hours?  That's broken.  So it isn't even good for farming trading cards to try to recoup some of the investment in the game.Game play is point and click with a God-awful user interface and cheap graphics.

												The absolute WORST in the series.  The puzzles (if you can call some of them that) are sometimes nonsensical.  Like in all DF games you walk around the same areas over and over and over and magically new items appear with no hints as to where you have to go next.  That is a perfect example of bad game design.  Take a great game series like Myst.  Puzzles make sense in the environment they're in. When you're stuck the game generally gives you hints on how where to go next.  The darkfall games dont do that.  You wander around aimlessly usually coming back to the same areas later in the game and you find new items there that weren't there before....how does that make any sense! It doesn't and it frustrates the player.  Even if you're a fan of DF don't buy this unless its on a 75% off sale.			",141,39,0,48,7,0,20

												It has some strange graphics options screen preboot that doesn't seem to work right. It starts out completely dark after 10 minutes of looking at a black screen with a cell phone in the corner I gave up and called this game a fail. I never ever want to play a game where you are given no direction and they start you out in a black screen. Its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid. I understand needing to learn puzzle games but if you have to spend any significant amount of time trying how to turn the lights on then its just as bad as crappy simulators.

												At first, the game seemed to have not much of a sense, but still, the little story I had seen made me want to go further. It happens that I wasn't able to play the game. It has too much flaws. It's usability is bad (I've seen posts and posts on people looking on how to save the game! This was meant to be something easy! I lost 30 minutes trying to save it, myself). If this wasn't enough, the game has too many bugs. On each scene I found some bug that made me restart the game and go all the way again. On the third time I got tired and stopped playing.So, this seems like a ""maybe good game"" that has been lost to bad usability, bugs and poor animations.2/10			",263,61,3,29,40,3,32

												Avoid.This kind of game would've been fine 20 years ago, but not 2009/2010, when it was released. The game has puzzles that could be solved within 3-4 hours, but because of the game interface it takes 3 times of that amount.You move from one sperical scene to another. This would be fine if you could at least pan around at will. No, you can only look into each of the 4 cardinal direction and have to suffer from awful and annoying transitions after every move. Plus you can look up and down, in every direction. Now consider that most directions don't show anything interesting and any wrong move or click makes you suffer through more slow transistion, you can imagine why this game isn't fun.So I decided to fast forward through the game with a walkthrough. And even with that the time you spend outside of puzzles, trying to get from place A to B take forever and are just not fun. I can't imagine how someone who needs to explore the often contrived puzzles gets through this without kicking his computer.It's a waste of time.			",450,243,16,45,49,3,86

												Checked out this game since the line under the main title interests me, ""it knows your name"".  Got the game started it and black screen with sound, knowing the title was ""dark""fall I was pretty sure it didnt crash my video card driver but couldnt tell.  Then suddenly Im ina  tunnel after figuring out my cell phone is the light.  Then randomly I pass out or something and wake up in a train yard where I find a room with some ghost whose not haunting the place but just being a jerk and wont let me buy.  You can see him in one of the screenshots above, is that his purpose for eternity, to be a jerk and not let me by?  See a door in same room try it and its locked, wow this sucks.  The pointing and clicking barely work, weird because I understand when a game has bad controls for a controller but a mouse?  was this game made in 1990?  Its nearly unplayable and moces so slow its hard to explain except to say that they should chance ""it knows your name"", to ""know your meme"", because this game is all 2edgy4m BS that literally goes nowhere.  broken controls, random events, slow gameplay, the only scary thing about this game is that it now haunts my game catalog.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			",2655,1121,101,267,367,29,398

												As a fan of the original Dark Fall, I went in to this hoping for a similar gameplay experience. I was not disappointed.  Clever and challenging puzzles, thoroughly disturbing visuals and sound, and a fairly easy and responsive interface.  My only gripes were with the save game being in the cell phone and never explained, and the slightly obnoxious ""Amy"" Otherwise, I definitely got my money's worth in creepy and challenging point and click style.

												Dark Fall: Lost Souls is a splendid game, if you like point and click puzzle games. Unfortunately i'm not a fan. The game story was rather delightful and the graphics were relatively decent but voice acting was simply atrocious, the puzzles felt uninspired and lackluster (as the case when you constantly have to backtrack through previous areas) and the loading times aren't the best. However it's not a bad game and i'm sure if you don't use a walkthrough you could be spending 10+ hours in the first (and only 3) areas.			",120,86,0,30,14,0,14

												I didn't play any of the previous Dark Fall Games so there might be some background informations I don't know.The story however makes sense but is pretty predictable.The gameplay is rather awkward and painfully slow.There are some major bugs in the game (at least for me) where I couldnt find any help on google either, only the confirmation that I am by far not the only one. Every once in a while the mouse keeps jumping in a way that it's impossible to reach the menue or do anything so only alt+f4 helps. This can be extremely frustrating as there are no autosaves.One thing there has to be mentioned is the worst voice acting I pretty much ever heard (at least for the protagonist).The puzzles usually are logical but there a few that get really frustrating as you have to roam the whole scene to find anything new that for some reason was not there before.But in the end I still give it a thumps ub as there is nothing between thumps up and down.If you really like horror adventures and can forgive a game a couple of flaws, this game can certainly entertain you.However if you get frustrated rather quick, like it fast paced or expect something then can compete with Daedalic or Telltale you better keep your hands off it.
