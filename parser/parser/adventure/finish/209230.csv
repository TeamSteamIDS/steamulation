												Great game of puzzles. Most are easy, but some are a challenge at the right time.The voice acting is horrible. No wonder they have an achievement just to watch the whole thing without skipping. No one would watch them otherwise...Nice game to get 100% achievements on and not too much work getting either.

												This is honestly one of my favorite HO games, not the least because I'm a Holmes fan and Hound of the Bakervilles is one of my favorite books.  However, I will warn the Sherlock purists that this game has only a very passing relationship to the book so if you're looking for a HO-version of the classic, you very well might hate this.  The story is really very different.In terms of general gameplay this is a pretty standard game for the genre, with HO scenes mixed with minigame puzzles and the usual inventory-based puzzles.  Where it departs from the norm is with a handful of special ""powers"" unlocked throughout the game that add to the puzzles; while in some cases it's apparent what you have to use and when, other times it took some thought and I appreciated that.Puzzles and minigames themselves are average difficulty, not hard but not too easy, with the exception of one or two of the minigames that were just obnoxious; however there is a skip button or if you're intent on getting a no-skip achievement, there are solutions online (I confess to being guilty of looking up one or two solutions for that reason).Sound and voice acting is nothing stellar but definitely better than the average, if you consider that most HO games have extremely poor voice acting.All in all, a great game with some unique aspects that make it stand out.  Worth it if you're a fan of this style of game.			",237,495,1,70,42,0,32

Sherlock Holmes and the Hound of the Baskervilles			* 7/10Another Hidden Object adventure involving Sherlock Holmes in one of his famous stories from the homonymous original novel. This time Frogware is just a publisher not the developer and this choice is evident in many ways inside the game.This short adventure starts With Henry Baskerville asking Sherlock Holmes to help him to break the curse of his family which involves a big Hound that brutally kills all of the Baskerville family members from generations. Now, for those who are familiar with Sherlock Holmes and the original novel, yes: this is not exactly a faithful transposition but it's more like an interpretation... Which works good and bad at the same time. Good beccause the adventure in a big mansion where a Demonic dog is supposed to be is quite a good idea giving the game a good dark atmosphere. Bad because this interpretation involves magic and time travel (without any particular consequence, so it's just an excuse to have another room with riddles with a few minor graphic differences), which really don't belong in a Sherlock Holmes adventure. As a Hidden Object game The gameplay doesn't need much explanation. You need to explore rooms or other ambiences, pick up items, interact with various objects and when you focus on determined zones you will be requested to find a long list of items very well hidden in the screen. Besides that you can find a very long list of puzzles and riddels, some of them are quite easy, but there are few VERY TOUGHT ones that forced me to get some help to deal with them.This title can count on a good soundtrack most of the times trying to give a tense atmosphere, maybe even more than necessary. Besides that Holmes, Watson and Henry Baskerville will often talk during the adventure and not just with captions as already happened with the persian carpet, but we can hear the original voice cast for our two protagonist, which is really appreciated.The worst side of this title I believe is the menu and game system, where you don't save because it's an automatic progress but you can't start a new game befor you completely finish it first unless you erase and create a new game profile... An operation that will delete your (ingame) achievements, which is the reason that took me 5 runs instead of just 2 to fully achieve the game.+++PROs+++ GOOD ADVENTURE. All in all this title represent a good adventure, with tough Hidden Object sections, Some very Hard Puzzles and Riddles, with easier ones, various dialogues with characters and a nice soundtrack.---CONs--- MAGIC. Actually This version of the Hound of the Baskervilles doesn't really suit a Sherlock Adventure mostly because it doesn't give an explanation at the end even though for all the time Sherlock says there Must be an explanation. SAVE SYSTEM AND MENU. This game doesn't have a way to restart the game unless you finish it first and the only way to do that is to erase your ingame profile and make a new one. But this way you will lose all your ingame achievements, and I don't recall being informed of this at the moment. ",499,128,12,20,23,4,28

												For a Frogwares game, this isn't bad at all. The story is appropriately ludicrous (and has nothing but the name in common with the book), but all in all it's rather inoffensive. The art is nice enough, the music and voice acting less so, but they get the job done without being jarringly bad. But most importantly, both the HOG scenes and the puzzles are decently done. I did find them to be mostly on the easier side even on the hard difficulty (with the exception of one or two puzzles towards the end that actually provided some challenge), but nonetheless they were enjoyable. So for anyone who doesn't normally play HOGs: This might not be a good enough game to get introduced to the genre with. (Though it is much better than the average HOG slop nonetheless, which may be a useful thing to keep in mind.)For HOG players: This is actually a fun game, with acceptable production values and enjoyable puzzles. The gameplay feels streamlined and doesn't ever get frustrating, plus it has some decent length. I'd still wait for a discount, but ymmv.Keep in mind that if you're playing with smaller children you may wonna pre-screen. There are no real scares, but some gore, which is suspiciously absent from the Steam screenshots.			",155,224,2,66,47,0,55

												Loved this game!!!!  Played it twice already and I had forgotten how to get through many of the rooms.  That is a feat for a HOG.  There are so many things to do and not always in the same order.  There are loads of rooms, alternate realities, things to collect and puzzles to do.  I loved how the map told you that you had unfinished business in certain rooms AND when a room was completed it let you know so that you were not going there over and over to find something you think you missed.Very interesting story and trumps almost all other Sherlock Holmes HOGs I have played.  Well worth the money, expecially since this is one to play over.  It's like getting double our money!I recommend this for all levels.  You will not be dissapointed!			",14,125,0,5,1,0,0

												A decent hidden object game with a decent backstory.  This is a superstition and mythical creature type of Sherlock Holmes story.  This is not your standard Sherlock Holmes.  The game features decent graphics and a good balance of hidden object / puzzle.  None of it is too hard as is the typical casual gameplay for this genre.  You won't be raving about this game, however, it's a decent enough game to warrant at least one play through.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												The supernatural elements seem out of place in a Sherlock Holmes story, and the voice acting is very stiff. Nevertheless, the numerous well-crafted, challenging hidden object scenes made this well worth the 3 1/2 hour playthrough (on easy mode with no hints or skips). Highly recommended for HOG fans.

												If you've ever read the book, then you'll probably have a hard time playing over the sound of Arthur Conan Doyle spinning in his grave.The 'story' (for a hidden object game) feels like the developers read the first two chapters, got the premise (American tycoon goes to live in a supposedly cursed mansion, gets Holmes to help) and then proceeded to have a fever dream.Gameplay is essentially just completing hidden object screens and solving simplistic puzzles, many of which are copied directly from other Waterlily games.Watson sounds alright, but Sir Henry's voice acting is as flat as a pancake, and Frogwares' Holmes actor sounds distant and condescending.Overall, if the Sherlock Holmes licence wasn't attached to this game and its plot, it would be semi-viable, but as it is, the licence has been maimed by the sheer absurdity of the mumbo-jumbo proceedings.

Short version: 84%A very simplistic hidden object puzzle game with a good name attached to it, Hound of the Baskervilles offers a quite interesting take on the famous novel.Long version:Let’s get this right out of the way: if you are a Sherlock Holmes purist, stay far away from this. Apart from the presence of Sir Henry Baskerville this game has nothing to do with the novel– not only the titular hellhound is an actual demon, but Holmes even uses magical powers to battle it.Despite this rather unique use of artistic freedom, the writing is the main strength of this title: both the short plot and the large number of dialogues are great and the actors do an excellent job as well.The game itself is just a glorified item gathering: you visit rooms to collect things either from the scenery or by playing meticulously crafted hidden object scenes, assemble them into some fairly challenging puzzles, which reward you with even more items. This pattern is repeated from start to finish with not change in the concept.Don’t be fooled though, the game isn’t easy. It is aimed at the more experienced hidden object players, who will undoubtedly have several hours of great fun with it.			",78,261,0,12,9,2,21

												If you're interested in this game because you're a huge Sherlock Holmes fan, I'm going to go ahead and warn you that the connections between this game and the story are loose at best. However, as a point-and-click puzzle game, I think it works very well. There's a variety of puzzles in addition to the hidden object games, and although most aren't too difficult, there are some challenging ones. Additionally, one thing I appreciated about this game was the map interface, which not only showed you which rooms still had tasks to do in them but also allowed you to teleport there by clicking on the room. Overall, I'd say that this game is a jaunt into a far more mysticized Sherlock Holmes story, complete with an interesting plot and a few fun moments with the characters. If you like hidden object games or puzzle games in general, I would recommend it.			",80,102,0,11,11,0,5

												Unlike most of the other Sherlock Holmes games on Steam, this is more a classic Hidden Object type game rather than Point & Click or FMV. It's a perfectly good game for its genre with good HO scenes and logic in puzzles. The puzzle type and difficulty varies greatly throughout the game; most are doable without guide or hints.The story follows Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson as they go with Lord Baskerville to his mansion to find out why his bloodline has apparently been cursed and his ancestors all died to this curse by being attacked by the creature known as the Hound of the Baskerville. As a Sherlock story it's a bit... blasphemous; the story has heavy focus on supernatural theme and there no logical solution is found (this is not really a spoiler),The game has good visual progress with throughout the game you complete ""badges"" to unlock powers to get into new rooms. Not really sure if this is good or not as it reminded me a bit too much of the much more child-friendly Princess Isabella games. All achievements are easily earned; the one it says you get for ""completing the game"" is actually earned for Easy mode only, and as it has an achievement for completing Hard mode, you'll have to play it through twice to get all achievements. All dialogues can be skipped and as I accidentally clicked away a sentence said by a character, I can only assume that the ""do not skip"" achievement is only messed up if you click ""skip"" on dialogues entirely and not for normal left-click for skipping the sayings individually. I didn't have too much problem with the voice-acting; Sherlock is a bit more enthusiastic in this game than he is in the later P&C games Testament and Crimes and Punishment. The sound effects and music is pretty good, but if you play League of Legends it might annoy you that in one musictrack there are sounds almost identical to ""found a game"" and ""game invite"" in LoL. Buy more for the Hidden Object genre than for it being a Sherlock Holmes game. You may wanna buy it on a discount as it's getting a bit old, but it's a very enjoyable game.			",91,167,0,12,10,0,17

Everyone is on Quaaludes and Holmes is channeling Spock. (The ending of this one is just fantastic. I couldn't parody the flat ""yeah, that sure was an interesting night"" delivery better if I tried) I believe most every game I've reviewed so far came from the same two companies, so it's interesting to have a bit of a change. Not too much of a change - HOGs mostly abide by the same basic formula - but a change nonetheless. Some elements are fairly major fumbles by a company not used to making HOGs - the game takes forever to start, won't close in response to alt+f4, and the Russian version apparently won't work at all on computers running Windows 7 - and it's not like we're talking about particularly old game failing to work with a newfangled system, this came out in 2010. On the other hand, there are some ideas here I wish more prolific HOG makers would steal wholesale.Homes, Watson and Sir Henry arrive at the Baskerville manor, to be confronted by a hall full of ancestral portraits. They must investigate the room (or set of rooms) associated with each ancestor in turn, collecting pieces of their coat of arms, and travelling into the past using a wolf-head with crystal eyes, to experience the moments right after said ancestor was murdered by the hound (an explicitly supernatural beast in this incarnation, obviously). As noted in the video link at the start of this review, everyone are terrible mellow about all the murders they've just missed, or all the spooky scares they encounter (actually, this bit is weird. We get 2-3 scare jumps as the game starts, and then... nothing else ever, as though someone flipped a switch) Once a coat of arms is assembled, the player receives a random supernatural power for the Baskerville family medalion - the power to smash♥♥♥♥♥♥ a flashlight, three arbitrary powers used 3-4 times each, and we ran out of ideas so the last two portraits just give you key pieces.Interesting innovations (besides the powers, which, as noted above, can be mostly replicated with a visit to the hardware store):Your clicks in Hidden Object Scenes are limited - after 4 or 5 misclicks, Holmes grabs your mouse and gives you a short lecture. This is frustrating but not as amazingly annoying as I might have thought, as the HOS' are actually well laid out, in consideration of the fact that your clicks are limited.When you're confronted with ""Collect 5 butterflies"" style puzzles, you are generally told exactly what you need to proceed, have a little ""X/Y collected"" counter, and the game will offer to teleport you to the spot when you have everything you need to open an obstacle. Better yet - not only is the backtracking limited and helped by the fast travel map, but the game will even tell you when you have ""completed"" an area and will never need to go back to it again. It's even removed from the fast travel map, which is kinda fantastic. The ""skip this puzzle"" button takes longer to charge than any HOG I've tried so far, but most puzzles were just about the right difficulty to be challenging but not frustrating.Recommended.

Some hidden object scenes are rather easy, but mostly the difficulty is average and most of the objects can be found (even if some are very well hidden).There are a lot of puzzles from easy to average, only one that is really tough - but you can always skip.So if you like HO games, this is definitely one of the good ones.

												Another HOG title from Frogware and another based around Sherlock Holmes. Any hard-headed fan of the books should probably stop and not look too hard at the plot here which bases itself around mystical murders, summoning, magic, dimension hopping and ghostly goings on. Its less Sherlock and more Doctor Who style of a story.In any case I probably should talk about the gameplay, the whole thing plays as a mix between an Adventure title and a casual Hidden Object game. As such theres a good amount of scenes where you have to scour for items, however theres also a good amount of puzzles to back the whole thing up. Theres nothing too difficult here but the scenes are varied and colourful enough and the game runs by at a fast enough pace to avoid players being too bored.Essentially if you dont mind the odd Hidden Object title, its one to pick up. If you cant stand Hidden Object titles however, theres nothing for you here. I think thats about as simple as I can put it.			",2511,1062,89,269,325,28,373

												I would only recommend this game for two reasons: Achievements, and its novelty.Other than that, I dunno why you'd even want to buy this game. If you want a good Holmes game, go play games like ""Holmes vs. Ripper"", ""Holmes: Awakened"" or ""Holmes: Nemesis"" (Note that these are truncated names I tend to use).Achievements aren't too difficult to get, as they usually involve solving puzzles in X amount of time, solving X puzzles in X time, and things like that. But the game needs to be played through twice to get everything, which is a pain, especially when you hit the Charles door puzzle. Augh.But once you've got the ""Golden Hound"" achievement, you get another perfect game added to your profile. Yay.Speaking of puzzles, most of them involve finding stuff in a screen of messiness, which can be painful because you think you find everything, and then you realise the object is placed in the stupidest place (Apparently, a crude drawing of a candle on the side of a door actually classifies as a candle object).Besides that, you have generic puzzles and all with varying difficulty, some better than others.As I mentioned before, the game has its novelties. How so? For starters, you get superpowers. Like, time-travel (selective moments only), super strength, telekinesis and some other ""totally logical"" abilities to help you solve the case.I gotta say, out of the entire Sherlock Holmes Humble Bundle, no other Holmes game has this feature.Probably because it makes less sense of the game with its very existence. But still novel.And the Hound of Baskerville? I didn't think they'd take it seriously as an actual Hell Hound, and defeating it requires a mystic ritual involving odd runed stones.What about other aspects?Character development? Pathetic, and didn't really help the story at all. Amusing, if anything?Interface? I don't recall much about it, but it was okay.Story? It made less and less logical sense the more I played it. Especially at the end with the puppy what's-his-face gifts to Holmes.Overall, I guess the best rating I'd give this is a measly 6/10. At least it's better than ""Holmes & the Mystery of the Mummy"".			",208,42,3,17,18,2,30

You get a medallion early on in the game, which gives you different powers to use as you progress (eg strength to break things to find more objects). The VOs for Holmes and Watson are good, but unfortunately Henry isn't the best. The ending is rather abrupt, but the last cutscene is really cute. I reccommend this for a sale because of the length (although I did skip some puzzles).			",233,375,2,75,46,1,45

												An excellent hidden object game.This simple title provides several hours of engrossing puzzles. The story, voice acting and graphics are a tad corny, making it seem more like a Scooby Doo episode than a true Sherlock Holmes mystery. However, the puzzles were very well done, and the game did a good job of pacing itself and keeping me interested. Bottom line: I'd recommend it if you're looking for an enjoyable diversion that will only last an evening or two.			",259,136,8,75,37,5,48

												A very fun hidden object with some fun other kinds of puzzles to mix things up.  It sort of exists in the world of the rest of the Frogware Sherlock Holmes games.  I think this ended up being what Watson wrote happened to them when they were actually on the Jack the Ripper case, since he wasn't allowed to tell the world how that turned out.Very lightweight game for when you're feeling burned out.

												I don't know what this game is, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting. Having played Testement, Awakened, Nemisis and the Ripper - all of which I found brilliant - I then came to this one.What the ♥♥♥♥ is this♥♥♥♥♥♥Find the (well many) hidden ojbect(s) in a 2D scene? Paintings that change? Stuffed heads that wink? A story line that departs from the real story before the intro has even finished?I was expecting another fine quality mystery in the vein of those I mentioned not some abomination.Suffice to say I didn't last long and the game has been uninstalled.

												I gotta sauy, I love a good adventure game. This, however, is not a good adventure game. At best, it's a mediocre  hidden object game. Of course, medicore is as good as a hidden object game can be, so that's a positive. I must also add, I've read The Hound of the Baskervilles... I'm not sure what this had to do with that book.

												Normally I am not much into hidden object games. More an Adventure/RPG type of gamer. But this game is done very well. It is very loosely based on 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' (actually so loosely that it has little to do with it ), however the creators just made a game that is fun to play and that is more important than trying to make a game realistic or following some story. Contrary to most adventure/casual games this has quite a lot of different kind of puzzles. For instance, one based on planar graphs, a puzzle based on rotating groups of tiles (which I found the most difficult yet solvable after a little thought), a few about identifying objects in a scene etc. It is nice to see a game with such a variety. The renderings are awesome. Don't expect much animation though the game is mainly still pictures with some animation happening when you solve a puzzle but the game still looks gorgeous.Another thing is that the game isn't too easy yet can be solved without a walkthrough. There are also buttons that let you skip a puzzle when you are stuck or ask for help. I skipped one puzzle ( the one where you have to compare, the painting of a vase, to the 'real thing' and find the differences) because I needed to quit).I clocked in about 16 hours.

												Yeeeah. I had to play through it 3 times to get the last achievement (Golden Hound - for having all the other achievements), which would not unlock despite me indeed having all the other achievements, because my two games (normal and hard) were done on two different profiles and they needed to be done on the same one. And the only reason I needed to do more than one anyway was that apparently finishing it on hard does not count as finishing it on normal.. what? That and the ""finish 10 hidden object puzzles in under 3 minutes each"" achievement is dumb since you get no feedback to tell you if you fail.Oh, and I couldn't find the actual save game file, no idea where it's hidden, so good luck to you if you mess up! I did find the save game screenshot thumbnail folder (inside %appdata%\roaming\frogwares\sherlock holmes and the hound of the baskervilles), and when those thumbnails were deleted/restored, it messed up and broke my existing test profiles, so that was fun too. My profile reset to a player name of ""Katy"" or something just before it broke completely. I wonder who that is.Not sure where the data itself was though. Apparently other people have save corruption or achievements not unlocking sometimes, thankfully I didn't have any other issues besides having to run it 3 times or I'd have had an aneurism.There is a reference to an easter egg.. somewhere.. as well, But I have no idea what/where it was. It just shows as a hidden achievement in game, but not on Steam, as far as I can tell.Achievements aside, the story breaks the realms of reality, going with Sherlock in a world with various magical powers. If you ignore the way they stomp all over the Sherlock lore, the story was okay, and one play through of the game will normally take you between 3h 30m to 4h or so, but the ending was absolutely terrible, an anti-climatic cutscene that made no sense and prematurely ended the game right at the climax of the plot, after all the build up to that point. Again.. what?Voice acting was halfway decent, but there were a couple of animated shorts at the start and end of the game, and they were TERRIBLE. They should have left it just as static scenes flashing from one to the next, that would have fit better with the rest of the game. I think that the animated shorts were so awful that they actually hurt the game in the end.Gameplay was mediocre, it's a really generic hidden object game, plus a few easy to medium difficulty puzzles, loosely covered in Sherlock Holmes wrapping paper. There is exactly one ""Sherlock Holmes-esque"" leap of deduction made by the Great Detective in the game - right at the start, when Henry arrived and was introducing the case. That's it. Hint and puzzle skipping mechanics seemed to work fine, no issues except that some of the items were actually unfamiliar to me and I had to Google them up to find out what I was supposed to look for since the list of items didn't include what the item looked like.The developer of the game was Waterlily Games, described by Wikipedia as being a sub-studio of Frogwares which ""focused on casual, hidden object, and light adventure games for PC and iOS"". In that light, they probably did a good job on the game, leaving the parent Frogwares to work on the ""true"" Sherlock adventure games.The only other Sherlock game I've played (and also 100%'d) before this is The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, and I loved that one very much. This one however, I cannot recommend. Even as generic hidden object or puzzle adventure games go, there are other better and more engaging ones out there for the same price, like Jolly Rover, Machinarium, Puzzle Agent 1-2, and others.

												I bought this without knowing it is a hidden object game. Regardless, I actually was invested in it. Although I actually hoped it would meet the standard for the other Sherlock Holmes games. If you want to feel the real deal of the experience, this game won't satisfy the craving. The show is more engaging or the source material. It is a good hidden object game, just not a good Sherlock Holmes game.			",358,230,0,55,7,3,27

												Major thumbs down. While this game has potential it constantly crashes under Windows 7 64 bit. The worst part about this is that there is no save game feature and thus when the program crashes one has to start a chapter all over again. Replay a few chapters more than once and watch one's frustrations rise. STRONGLY AVOID.			",18,32,0,9,0,2,6

												Why this game carries the title of ""Sherlock Holmes"" I can't possibly explain--the ""unusual representation"" is more of what I would call a travesty.The game itself is a typical hidden object puzzler with moderate RPG elements. The puzzles are often tedious and there are no hints to help you out in those, only a skip that takes awhile to activate. If you're looking for a hidden object game you might enjoy this game (but not even for the $10 price tag). If you're here to play a Sherlock Holmes game, run.			",118,99,0,28,25,3,18

												Let's be honest, it's a Hidden Object game. It succeeds very well in being a Hidden Object game. Most of the puzzles can be solved with a bit of logic, but if you've played some of the puzzle games like Professor Layton or Puzzle Agent, you'll be able to solve many by memory, rather than logic. Most of the hidden object areas aren't the hardest and there's a good hint system to help you out.Voice acting seems to be by the same guys who do Watson and Holmes in the other Frogwares games, if you're particularly attached to them.If you like Hidden Object games, this is probably a game that you will enjoy for a few horus.(PS... This isn't exactly how the real story goes... This is more... Sherlock Holmes with superpowers and time travel... But hey, Sherlock Holmes with superpowers and time travel, right!?)

												If you're trying to learn about Sherlock Holmes, this is the wrong place to start. It takes the basic plot of the novel (demonic dog targets family) and then goes batshit crazy with it. Fortunately, they do it in such a fun way that I don't think it detracts from the game at all.It's a very good-looking point-and-click game with some pretty good puzzles and very good pacing. Sure, there are too many Hidden Objects puzzles, but those are so easy and short that I was never annoyed by it. Puzzles vary in difficulty and there are a few types of puzzles that make a second appearance, but there's still a lot of variation.The music is a bit overly dramatic, but certainly not bad. Not memorable either, though. Controls and the map work really well and the whole thing is well executed, although the dialogue and cinematics are mediocre.Still, all the parts you actually play are a lot of fun, provided you don't worry about canon or taking things too seriously.

Overall: Got this in a bundle and enjoyed it but I would probably not pay full price for it if I had to.- This is a short game but it's not horrible. - It was the first of the Sherlock Holmes games that I had played, but I am a fan of hidden object puzzles so I had a good time. The other puzzles were not very challenging, though at least the solutions were usually pretty self explanatory.- Voice acting is decent; music is dramatic but it fits the feel of the game.  * Note: If you play the game on easy mode, it will guide you to the next step (the area you should click starts sparkling) if you wait for more than 10 seconds or so. Can be helpful if stuck but can possibly be annoying if you are just pausing for a second to do something else.			",77,52,3,26,12,1,6

												Recomended only for Hidden Object Games Fans.It may be a Sherlock Holmes game but the puzzles cannot stand up to his name. If you have played other of Frogwares' games you will find a lot of simularities in them. The hidden objects are well blended in the background and not impossible to find. You can do them without a single hint if you want to spend the time on it.About the story, it barely has anything to do with the novel. It is completely made up and really off Arthur Conan Doyle's style. And regardless of that it kept me going until the end, even if it was very predictable.The music and graphics are very impressive. There is only one track going on during the whole game but it is long enough to annoy you. The vocing is well directed and well executed. The characters and the layouts have a lot of effort put in the details and are just gorgeous.The game can be finsihed for less then 5 hours with or without hints. And the only replay value comes from completing the achievments.I got the game in a bundle and I wasn't going to buy it if it wasn't in it, but have in mind I dislike Hidden Object Games, but I still enjoyed it.

												This game was enjoyable enough that I did a second run on easy to get all achievements (you don't get the easy achievements for completing the game on hard difficulty). Both settings are enjoyable,with the hard setting throwing a couple decent challenges at you. If you look at this game as a typical adventure game, it does its job well. The puzzles were about the right difficulty, you had to combine items you had gotten before, use the ""amulet powers"" and you can beat the game using only your logic. I do not care much for the highlight object mini-games though, since most of the time you find the item you want easily but still have to collect random stuff like lamps and feathers for no apparent reason. The pallete and textures are decent and most of the items in the highlight object mini-games can be seen clearly. Some are harder to see, but still it is more an issue of clever use of environment rather than not being able to distinguish something from the environment (unlike previous games like Dracula: Origin).WARNING: The following contains spoilers.Much like Baskerville Hall, not everything is sunny though. My biggest problem is how the source material is used. As I said, this is a solid adventure game, but not a very good Sherlock Holmes story. There are supernatural elements that are left unexplained, the main plot is not given a rational explanation as one would expect from Holmes and so on. I was very dissapointed by the ending, but it became apparent in the middle of the game that either this must be a dream or there is no way that there is a rational explanation for all of this. Even if we ignore this and treat this as a typical non-Holmes detective story, there is not a final verdict on who used the hound or something like that (in contrast to the book). In the end, you feel more like a ghost hunter than a detective.If you are a casual adventure games player this game is worth it, especially if you find it on sale or bundled. I am afraid hardcore adventure players will just breeze through it, so only get it if you have finished harder games and want to kill some time. Sherlock Holmes fans should probably best avoid it, since the source material is not treated well.Finally, one can see that Frogwares has evolved from earlies titles and continues to evolve to the much better ""Testament of Sherlock Holmes"". I am at least happy to see this as a stepping stone towards a better future for a small developer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not the best hidden object game out there, but good enough that you'll want to finish it.  It does have a couple interesting tack-ons, such as the Elements, and a couple tough puzzles, particularly towards the end.  Art is decent and I didn't find the HO scenes too dark, which can absolutely ruin a HO game.There are only two difficulty levels - Easy and Hard.  Hard is more like Casual in other HO games.  Hints are available, and without penalty, an auto-hint will alert your next move if you take too long in a room, and the map notates rooms that have a current puzzle or object available.As a couple others have stated, the story is rather ludicrous, but worst is the voice acting.  Now, Frogwares, I'm sure you didn't have a large budget for the voice acting, but you could have at least had the actors slow down a little and use the punctuation properly when they were speaking.  It was like they were speed reading the script.Lastly, I was very disappointed with the end.  It just kind of...ended.			",409,169,6,95,66,5,153

												So on one hand, the art is VERY well done, and the puzzles aren't bad. On the other hand, a lot of it is just a hidden object game, and the story (what little there actually is of it) has basically nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes. All in all, it's cheap, but you just can't help but get the feeling there should be more to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just can't quite recommend this one. The supernatural story is an affront to Holmesian reason, the voice actors are poorly cast, and the visuals are often of poor quality. Moreover, the hidden object scenes are roughshod and the puzzles range from dirt simple to frustratingly unintuitive. There are certainly some redeeming qualities here and there - an excellent map, for example - but the overall experience is just a little sub-par.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
