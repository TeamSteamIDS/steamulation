The Ten Commandments of the Assassin's Creed:1) No running or you will be killed on sight.2) No galloping or you will be killed on sight.3) No walking on the roof or you will be killed on sight.4) Dirty thief! I'll have your hand for that!5) No loitering in the guard's treasured personal space for more than two seconds or guess what?You will be killed on sight.6) No swimming or...never mind, you'll die anyway.7) No bumping into people or you will be killed on sight.8) No climbing buildings or you will be killed on sight.9) If you don't slouch and leave one hand hanging while trotting at a snail's pace on your horse, you will be killed on sight.10) They say it is a crusade! But a crusade for what? Ignorance? Violence? Infidel! I'll have your hand for that!Silliness aside, take these with a sackful of salt, as they are very subjective:Story: 7.0/10Interesting, but doesn't tug too hard on those heartstrings.Setting: 8.5/10If you're a history buff, you are in for a ride. The Holy Land! The Third Crusade! Islam and Christianity butting heads! Ancient conspiracies! Illuminati! (well, not exactly, but close enough) Violence! Madness! Infidel! I'll have your hand for that!Art style: 8.0/10Nothing much to shout about, but if I walked through Syria eight hundred years ago, I think this would be pretty accurate.Gameplay: 6.5/10If you are not a patient person, don't buy this game. Many a time I have pounded the table because something was tedious or inscrutably difficult. However, it wasn't so bad as to keep me from completing the game. Bringing some grey matter with you while playing is highly recommended.Overall enjoyment: 7.5/10It's not a bad game, but it's not overwhelmingly awesome either. My main sticking point is in the gameplay. However, if you can tolerate that, I think you might like this classic.			",57,3,3,1,3,0,0

												Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft.The first of the series, this game tells the story of Desmond Miles, an assassin descendant who tried to escape his life as an assassin and try to live like normal people. Instead he got kidnapped by the Abstergo Industries. There, his real adventure begins. Desmond is forced to interface with the Animus, a device that is capable to replay genetic memories of the user's ancestors. The Abstergo seeks to uncover information about Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a legendary assassin from the Third Crusade.The gameplay of Assassin's Creed is quite interesting but also very repetitive and linear. It's repetitive because before you assassination missions begin, you need to conduct some side mission to get information for your main mission. The side mission include pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interogation and completing various task of your fellow assassin's which include, killing guards, race or flag capturing. You will do those side missions everytime you're going to assassinate someone. The good part is, you are free to choose which side mission you want to complete, only 3 from 6 side missions needed for the main missions to unlock. The freedom of the game is also quite big. You can explore the whole city of Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Kill guards from behind, help civilian from rogue soldiers, find and kill templar soldiers or climb a tower and perform a leap of faith. You can travel from a city to another city with horses. Despite all these freedom, the game is till linear.The graphics are beautiful and amazingly detailed. The textures are just, amazing. The animation are also very great. The physics effect are also good, you can watch dead guard roll over the rooftops and eventually fall to the ground. The lightning is perfect too. The environment combined with the AI make the game feels more alive with the civilians walking around, the guards patrolling about and some beggars will try to annoy you.Assassin's Creed is a good start if you want to dive into the world of Assassin's Creed series as this game contains the foundation of the whole story. Even with linear story, you still have the freedom to do many things in this game. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												- Personal Rating: ""Single Playthrough"" - Traditional Rating: ""7 / 10""The first game in the now very popular Assassin's Creed franchise. While this entry wasn't as popular as the following sequels, it's still a pretty decent game even now in it's own right. In this entry, you play as the arrogant Altair (and Desmond controlling him through a machine called ""The Animus"") as he is forced to recover his original rank among the Brotherhood after a mission gone wrong. Now, bearing in the mind that this IS the first game in the series - the game has two ""stances"" combat and movement. In movement, there are further two stances - Blended mode, movement is slower but makes you less conspicuous, even less so if you use the ""Blend"" command and then there's the ""Free Run"" mode, where you hold down a key/button and movement will be much faster and will be able to automatically scale walls, jump from buildings, etc as well as do a more ""flashy"" assassination maneuver. The combat stance is accessed when you are locking on to an enemy and have a weapon drawn. By holding the same key/button you use for ""Freerun"" is the same key you use to block incoming enemy attacks, the rest of the moveset is a your standard attack, grapple and step (dodge) - by holding the block key and pressing the attack key will initiate the Counter animation (when unlocked). It's not a very complex system but it works and is fun to experiment with.Altair has with him an arsenal that gets bigger as you progress through the game (Yes story, not collectibles). You start out with a standard sword and of course your handy Hidden Blade. Later on, you gain the (overpowered) throwing daggers and a better standard sword. Now I made a mention of the daggers per se because you will be using these a LOT. They one shot enemies off combat or if you're far away from them, they work on Assassination targets fights by decreasing their health by quite a lot and staving regular enemies off easy.Now the real meat of the game is, of course, exploration and assassinations. Each city and the road in between them is filled with bustling life that looks and feels very natural as well as enemies and NPCs react to what you're doing very realistically - like say if you're scaling a wall, an NPC will say something according to it. Every city, like Jerusalem, Acre, etc - is very detailed themselves and is a visual treat to see. The enemies and NPC models are pretty well varied across each city with minor details changed up in faces to distinguish some people from others, their facial expressions and the such are also pretty decent, though not as good as Altair's. As far as your objectives in the game go... it's nothing very interesting, at all. Each city has about the same objectives everytime you're sent on an Assassination mission - you're forced to climb up to Synchronization points scattered through that city until you find ""Investigation"" missions, which serve more as game padding than anything else in my opinion because they aren't varied enough. Two of them involving fellow assassin's have you racing from Point A to point B within an alloted amount of time, another has you ""stealth"" killing special enemies - other missions involve ""Interrogations, which have you following an NPC around till you feel it's a correct time to beat the information out of that person, another has you ""Eavesdropping"", a mission that has you merely sit on a bench and listen to two NPC babble on, and one that involves listening to NPCs babble on about some special item, whom which you ""Pickpocket"" from them. You only need atleast 2 or 3 out of the usual 6 per Assassination Mission to actually access the Assassination mission. And this process will repeat about 9 or so times throughout the ENTIRE game. One issue I had with the game was that it felt a little too random at times. There were times where I failed an investigation mission, had to kill the enemies or die so I could restart it merely because there was a group of enemies walking by that for some reason notice you while others don't. It was irritating. - However the actual assassination missions are amazing, and easily the most fun you will have in the game. You can complete most assassination missions without being seen and resorting to combat since there's no set timer and the game forces you to think your options through and act accordingly. Some later missions sadly force you to resort to combat, which lessens the impact the assassination has because it's a bit random, you can be fighting a group of enemies and then another second when you counter ANOTHER enemy, you'll see Altair jump on top of the target and kill him randomly.An issue I did have with the game that may put off a lot of people - combat. The combat is generally really slow and clunky and is really random. At first, the enemies behave pretty predictably and are easy to kill - more so considering that they actually wait until you kill someone else first and just stare at you brutally murdering them THEN decide to attack you, or some enemies actually flinch allowing for an easy chain kill - then they start countering your moves as enemies get stronger. Unlike what you may read around, no, later on in the game, most counters will NOT one hit kill enemies, Altair may just push them back and you have to do that killing yourself by attacking the downed enemy. Something that I felt was rather random was sometimes the counters don't seem to work outright, and you end up taking more damage than what you needed to, sometimes because of things outside your control. Later on aswell, the enemies take a liking to grappling you a LOT and that can get REALLY annoying. Not to even mention that you CANNOT hit the boss enemies when they are grounded. The AI is also really stupid - in closed areas of the game, if you get low on health, just run circles around the enemies until you get some health back.All in all though, I had fun with the game. I actually do recommend it lightly to those that enjoy the thrill that is careful preparation and to those that love seeing worlds that feel alive. Annoyances like the NPC beggars (whom will actually block movement sometimes and are EXTREMELY annoying), the random and clunky combat, and the repetitiveness of the Investigation missions will seem more forgetable after you get to the better parts of the game. Altair becomes a more likeable character and the story itself, while not as clear (sequels) will actually keep you wanting to see more of what the game can offer - and of course the amazing Assassination Missions, the reason you're playing this game.Edit: I forgot to mention, this game DOES have collectibles in the forms of Flags scattered across the world. I personally didn't go after them in the game as they have no real incentive or motive to collect them other than for collectionists' sake.			",907,239,29,104,39,8,85

												Assassin's Creed came out in 2007 and here I am 7 years later playing this game for the first time. I must say that I have purchased it during the sale but I can tell you right now that its worth the full price. Not to mention it's only like $10 anyway! So what's so fun about it you might ask. Let me tell you. After you finally start running around and killing the enemies the game becomes fun! I have once spent 80% the mission just hunting the guards and doing all the other random things. For me, the selling part of this game is running around and jumping on the rooftops. Controls. I understand that this game was ported from a console so controls for PC only users will be funny. I didn't not try to reset them because they are still well put. But, its not your normal WASD + ctrl and space. You will just have to get used to that. While playing this game you don't often notice the sound effects and the music, but I can tell that it plays its part in delivering the whole picture very well. Its nothing impressive, but what is important that it does not spoil the experience and only enchants it. Although I have not tried, but I can see myself actually playing some other music while running around the city. The very first time I ran this game was actually in 2007. The computer I was running it on couldn't even handle it. That is partially the reason why I only came back to the game now. At the time of release the graphics very amazing. The foggy city environment impressed me in particular. The models of characters are very well made as well, buildings are quite detailed. Nothing really to complain about as 7 years later it still looks good. You might say, what an unfair review, where are the negative things? Well they are here as per any game. For example I don't quite like how character moves sometimes and how he cant do certain jumps and things. But its all negligible I think. Oh, and once I flew from my horse really high. The worst thing is that it only saves your game when you have completed something which can be quite an annoyance. The story is not all there is to do. You can actually explore the cities to find some random flags. I am not too sure what they going to give you at the end, but there's quite a number of them to be found and  they also might be in places where you wont be able to reach from the first time. So a few more challenges. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the Templars. They are very hard to deal with, but there are always ways to abuse the system( find out for yourself). Re-playability is low in my opinion, because once you finish this game you can get the next one and then the next one and so on. You will be playing the same game but with the different filling inside. So in overall, I think the developers made a externally good game( which evolved into a big sequence of games). I would recommend this game to pretty much anybody.			",167,29,10,30,25,0,38

												*Jim Carrey* I like it a lot.I had heard a lot of good and bad things about this particular game in the franchise which made me a little unsure on whether or not I was going to enjoy it. Which would have been pretty bad if I didn’t seeing as I binge traded for pretty much the whole franchise. The main impression I got from people was that the story was good but the gameplay was repetitive to the point of you just wanting to get to the end ASAP. Which, in ways, it was repetitive. But for me it was more than tolerable. The story kept me interested enough for me to not really mind all that much. It has a “Batman Arkham City” feel to it. Or at least for me it did. The world is open but there are a limited range of activities you can actually do.Story wise, I enjoyed it! I constantly wanted to know what was going on and I wanted answers, dang nab it! At points it messed with my head, made me think of all kinds of weird possible plot twists and weird philosophical theories on truth and reality. Which is great! Might just be me but you gotta love games that poke at your brain a little. There was a whole element to the game that kind of comes up in-between chapters that I didn’t even know existed. You don’t really see that side to it in the trailers so that was interesting to me.I played through this with (well, at the same time as) a friend whilst on call and from the profanity that came from my mouth and just how angry I was getting at times it wouldn’t surprise me if he thought I hated this game. A few times I did actually shout “OH MY GOD I HATE THIS GAME”. But it was lies! Point being that even though I raged quite a lot, I still really enjoyed it.The mechanics for the game are great, the parkour kind of free-running stuff is really fun when it’s not being annoying (although you get used to it), the combat is fun but was the main part I raged at to be honest. (Probably just horrific at it). The assassin/stealth parts of the game are also really good. Makes you feel all badass being able to be really sneakily stealth kill some suckra then free-run your way out of it.One thing I kept in mind the whole time whilst playing this game was that this game is pretty darn old. It was released around 2007 or somewhere around there. I think it’s been touched up since then, but still for how old it is especially, it’s a good game.All in all, I like it and I look forward to continuing the franchise!TL;DR : Gameplay is somewhat repetitive (although it’s not that bad) but it makes up for that with an interesting story. Awesome stealth/assassin/parkour/combat mechanics and all around an awesome game for how old it’s getting these days. Definitely worth trying this. ",421,281,31,20,33,5,36

												Assassin’s Creed was released for consoles amidst a sea of controversy. Despite its critical praises for its beautifully designed locales and fresh storytelling perspective, it was slammed by some for being too repetitive. Every mission is carried out in the same manner: interrogate an informant, pickpocket a citizen, and eavesdrop on a conversation. These actions would lead towards an assassination, which would complete a mission: rinse and repeat.Assassin’s Creed puts you in the shoes of an assassin named Altaïr and takes place in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade in 1191 AD. Altaïr is the ancestor of modern day bartender Desmond Miles. Desmond was taken in by a mysterious organization for questioning, and strapped into a device called an Animus machine, which allows the user to revisit his ancestor’s past memories.The concept of the game is quite out there, but it does work. Every so often Desmond will have to “take a break” from the machine, and you’ll get to walk around in the real world to learn a bit of history behind Desmond’s family tree, as well as the true intentions of the organization holding him. The story progresses in a manner that simply draws you in.Surprisingly, Assassin’s Creed breaks the action game trend and delivers exquisite dialogue and voice acting. Despite the fact that Altaïr clearly has an American accent, his voice actor delivers his lines with an uneasy seriousness to them, which allows you to take the character seriously, and draws you closer to the game’s world. The free-running controls are excellent. If I had one complaint, it would be that they were too easy to use. Parkouring and climbing is almost automatic when you’re sprinting, which makes some sections too easy.Combat-wise, Assassin’s Creed doesn’t do anything revolutionary, but it gets the job done for the most part. Battles are comprised of a simple system of blocking, striking, and countering.Combat itself is pretty fun, even if it’s not all that complicated. The biggest complaint against Assassin’s Creed is the similar manner in which missions are conducted. There are four towns in the game, and one hub world. Each town has a poor, middle-class, and rich area, and you will visit each during the course of the game to murder a specific target. The events that lead up to the actual kill are always the same, but the confrontations are vastly different from one another.If you can get past the game's mission-based structure and lack of replay value for the common gamer, you'll find an epic tale of betrayal and intrigue in Assassin's Creed that really shouldn't be missed.Overall 8/10.

A world both gorgeous & fun to traverse // Recommended for fans of both open-world and stealth adventures+ As the first game of the franchise, it is both novel in concept and scope of narrative+ Platforming elements are extremely polished and satisfying; climbing is simple in practice and is competently animated+ Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous+ Voice-acting (with one notable oversight, addressed below) is excellent; general sound-design, too, is strikingly original+ UI, though it breaks the immersion a bit, is practical and aesthetically pleasing+ Bissfully short load-times; game's engine runs smoothly and efficiently+ Quick-travel is available as the explorable areas increase+ Swordplay, though not as emphasized as a gameplay element, is still quite cinematic and enjoyable+ Myriad collectibles and viewpoints to unlock, scattered throughout the world+ Stalking targets is broken down into a series of minigames; though tragically un-varied (there are only 6 variations), they nonetheless do their part to uphold immersion- Exiting the game requires movement through 3 or 4 menu screens; quitting a game has never been so frustrating- Segments revolving around Desmond (in the year 2012) often seem to drag on well beyond what is required to set up that angle of the plot; seriously breaks up the pacing- Beyond the drive to get a 100% save file, there is little incentive to replay after a successful playthrough- Limited tangible incentive to explore and collect; doing so is done so for its own sake- Protagonist's voiceover is decidedly American, in stark contrast to the authentic accents of virtually all other characters; massive break in immersionLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												TL:DR? See ConclusionNote: This being the first game in the franchise, I will review it as if the sequels did not exist.INTRODUCTION:Assassin's Creed is the first title of the popular Ubisoft Franchise of the same name. It is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy Lands during the medieval period, more specifically, during the Crusades. It was originally released for the consoles back in 2007 with a PC release the following year.The game places you in the shoes of Desmond Miles who, using a machine called the Animus, accesses the genetic memory of his ancestor Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad in an attempt to retrace a series of events that would lead him to an unknown artifact called “Piece of Eden”. Journey across the war torn Holy Lands and watch history unfold as every action Altaïr makes, unravels another piece of a greater mystery and conspiracy that stretches across several generations.PROS:+ Good Storytelling with a refreshing mix of historical, and sci-fi elements.+ Good combat, stealth and core gameplay mechanic+ Graphically beautiful despite its age at the time of this review+ World and level design are well done+ Beautiful atmospheric surroundings+ Lots of NPCs which make the Holy Land feel alive and immersive+ Interesting and memorable characters+ Good sound design and voice acting+ Top notch animation quality+ Large semi-non-linear map to explore+ Target assassinations can be completed in several ways+ No Uplay account requirementCONS:- Combat becomes repetitive- Counter-attack can be seriously abused- Not much to do outside the Animus (while you're Desmond Miles)- Useless and unrewarding collectibles which results in...(see next con)- Not much incentive to explore the vast game world- No progression system to speak of (not a lot of upgrades or weapon variation)- Master Assassin Altaïr cannot swim (living in the desert is not an excuse)- Lepers and BeggarsCONCLUSION:Assassin's Creed is a good game with a very interesting story which mixes together historical background and sci-fi elements. It has a vast atmospheric world and together with the beautiful graphics and sound design, makes for an enjoyable experience. I kinda wish they had more rewarding side missions though. Combat is fun, stealth is satisfying and the core mechanic, although it can feel repetitive at times, rarely gets boring.Overall its GOOD and a GOOD BUY. As it stands, buying the game at full price is not bad but since the game goes on sale frequently, I suggest waiting. It's a good game to have in your library as a collector's item if anything else.---------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Yet another PC port by Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed is crazy fun if you know what you're doing.The story behind this Assassin vs Templar universe begins here, but it curiously takes place concurrently in the present day as well as in the past. On the one hand, we have master assassin Altair letting his inflated ego get the better of him, causing him to slip up in a big way, breaking all three of the Creed's most sacred tenets. We follow his path to redemption through the task of 9 assassinations - a task that sees Altair change who he is for the better of all in the guild.The story of the present day centres on Desmond Miles. This story is intermittent at best, as the majority of the game is played out in Altair's time, but to sum it up, he has been captured and forced to relive Altair's memories through a device called an Animus, able to 'view' the genetic memories of the occupant. For those that haven't played, there are spoilers, so I won't go into the details.The strange dual-story actually works quite well, as subsequent games have proven in their popularity. I have played all games up to and including AC3, so in hindsight this game set the scene well for future sequels.Controls can be clunky at times. It's easy to get used to, but something simple like running at top speed requires W for moving forward, holding down right click on the mouse to change into High Profile (think: more obvious to be spotted) actions, the space bar as well to hit the sprint and auto jump at building edges or to jump over gaps automatically... and to top it off you have to hit Shift if you want to catch yourself with a grab if you don't quite make the jump. This is an extreme case though, and it should be noted that you are encouraged to move slowly and take your time with your movements so as to not arouse suspicion from guards.But wait, there's more! Running and jumping - hell even walking and jumping, is made still more ridiculous by the fact that half the time you'll end up somewhere you didn't want to go, or weren't aiming for. Case in point: walking down an alley, you suddenly decide you want to climb the walls and windows up to the rooftops. You turn around and start a run up to the wall so that you'll start climbing when you reach it... only there's this fence you'll brush past on your way there. By some fluke or quirk of fate you'll find yourself climbing the fence instead... even though the fence is at the same level as you are. You'll find yourself hanging on to the end of this fence for dear life... because you wouldn't want to fall! The ground is literally right at your feet. Naturally you'll agree with onlookers when they start muttering ""Somebody should stop him, before he hurts himself"" and ""What a fool!""So movement can be either really funny or really frustrating depending on the situation. Weapons consist of fists (useful for getting information out of people), swords, knives, and of course the signature hidden blade we all know and love. <3 You'll find there's a pretty even spread of circumstances for using these, and once you get the counter-kill and grab-counter moves combat will be nothing more than an annoying trifle on your way to the next part in the story.Being the 'assassin'-type game that it is, I find it disappointing that everything so easily turns into a bloodbath. Check my screenshots if you don't believe me. Whether it's a mission assassination or just trying to walk past a patrol, you'll soon discover people from all over the world want to throw themselves on your sword. Sometimes it takes as much as twenty bodies on the ground before your opponents realise they can't win too, and then even after you wipe out a massive group and finally become anonymous again, another patrol comes around a corner and the whole thing starts all over again. I open the map sometimes just to see if the city population changes - I'm sure I killed that many.Gameplay consists of various mission types and collectibles in addition to the main 9 assassination missions. In order to 'access the memories' you have to do research about your targets - these can consist of taking out rooftop archers for a brother assassin that can't do it for some reason or another; a race; eavesdropping; punching up the town crier for info, then killing him anyway ^_^; pickpocket missions, and a couple of others. The assassinations themselves, while I appreciate the variety of set-ups and environs, don't satisfy me as much as they could have. Unlike any nuffie guard you could off then walk away without being detected (even in front of other guards, I might add), every single core mission sees you enter these weird nowhere places where time doesn't seem to flow and you can talk to your victim regardless of the fact you just stabbed him in the neck. Afterwards you employ the 'run like hell' strategy, because somehow the whole city knows what you've done even before you get there. And there's about twenty guards in hot pursuit, because most times you dont have the opportunity to clear the area before you go in for the kill (not without alerting your mark anyway).Like I said, the game is a blood bath, with far too much combat and contrived scenes, and not enough stealth.The graphics are passable for it's age, although I find the colour palette lacking. Jerusalem is all grey, Damascus is all terracotta, and I think Acre is a different shade of grey. To be fair Damascus is pleasant, it was definitely my favourite of all the areas. Inside the Masyaf fortress is a close second.I think the variety of characters is good. There are the drunks, wandering aimlessly through the streets and somehow always knowing when Altair is around so they can push him around. The town criers and their propoganda speeches will stay with you well after you finish playing (not in a good way). The beggars can get really, really, really annoying, but remember you can punch them when guards aren't alerted - they won't do anything. ""No! You don't understand - I'm poor and sick and HUNGRY!"" *BAM* Let's face it, everyone punches beggars.Where the game really shines for me is its soundtrack. Especially when everything goes to hell and everyone knows you're a villain - because the music will go crazy! The chase and combat music during the core missions simply cannot be beat, I believe it's Access the Animus. It's worth a listen to. There are other great tracks as well - all done by Jesper Kyd, notorious for his awesome work on various games now. I highly recommend checking him out.Despite the problems I encountered, the freezes, glitched collectibles (!*$@# FLAGS!), crazy amount of guard killing and stupid auto-jumping ... I had loads of fun. And I confess the present-day story had me not just intrigued, but hooked. Perhaps it'll hook you too.			",144,138,1,51,6,0,4

												Did you ever think to yourself...  ""Wow, I wish I could be an assassin,"" indiscriminately executing evil doers and fiends alike?  I certainly know the answer to that question for myself was a passionate yes!  Occasionally as a child I would don a white sheet around my neck, painted with a red cross.  I would stealthily sneak around  my living room, surprising my family members with a cardboard dagger, I created from a produce box..  I would pounce from behind the couch and pretend to slash my father, my mother, my brothers, it didn't matter who.  Ahh those glorious days when I was a wee lad and my imagination could run wild for hours.. or until the ADHD compelled me to find something else to do.Well Assassins Creed may be just the game to fill your childhood role-playing fantasy's in reality.. after all it's far better and cheaper than trying to actually become an assassin am I rite?  To start off with it needs to be said that Assassin Creed is the grand daddy of the Creed series, so the AI is kind of dumb and undeveloped, the game play is repetitive and the combat is slightly boring.  Yes I said it Assassin Creed on paper isn't a very good game at all....  I'm talking in 2016, where as in 2008 when the game came out it was fresh and new, so quite a few of the issues which plague the game were forgivable.  It wouldn't be a good review if I left out that the game feels very dated now.THE STORY Starts you off as Altair an assassin on a mission, I won't spoil what you're after, but if you put two and two together you'll figure it out (It's pretty much a tutorial getting you familiar with the game..)  After the fairly short tutorial mission you'll awaken to find yourself in the shoes of a man named Desmond Miles..  He's being held hostage and forced to enter the Animus, a machine which can somehow bring out the memories of your ancestors.. I won't go into anymore detail as I wouldn't want to spoil the fun of discovering the story. THE GAMEPLAYThis is the meat and potatoes of any game, the actual game play.  In Assassin Creed unfortunately the gameplay gets rather repetitive, it's set up on a series of memory blocks, which are self contained stories which combine together to form the story arc.  In the game or the Animus you are greeted with 6 or 7 different investigations, 3 of which are required to access the unique Assassination.  These are generic Eavesdropping, pick pocketing, Interrogations (nearly identical to pick pocketing, only this one requires you to beat up the target for information).  The few others scattered in are timed flag captures, assassinations, and destruction mission..   This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't repeated on every stage, about 3 times per map. You also have two types of collectibles, each of the 5 major areas has it's own set of collectibles.  Flags, view points and citizens... the flags offer little to no reason to actually collect them, I suppose on the console versions collecting all of them would net you an achievement or trophy, but the PC version offers nothing.  I guess this was just left over from the console version..  Competitionist will probably enjoy tracking down these little boogers, but the rest of us will just ignore them as you gain nothing from collecting them.  The view points are far more valuable as each one removes fog off the in game map, and reveals the locations of investigations, and citizens which you can rescue from harassment.  The Citizens unlike the flags actually have the added benefit of placing either a roving band of Scholars which allow you to easily escape from guards or citizens who grab and stop guards from chasing you.THE COMBAT, The combat appears to be a button masher at first, but you'll quickly discover the true way to be a master assassin is using Counter Attack, which often times turns combat into a long drawn out affair.  Instead of mashing down the buttons and quickly ending the guards, you're left to wait for an attack.. It can take the Guards anywhere from 5 - 15 seconds to attack.  Early on in the game you're assassin seems much more capable of killing guards, normally a counter attack means the guard dies.  Later on the guards can take three or four counters to actually die.  Many encounters have the potential of having 10+ guards.  So do the math... the game is called ""Assassin"" Creed though, so you'll figure out that it's much easier to run away and hide than try and fight them all..THE GRADE, in 2008 when the game was first released, I'd give it an easy 9/10, it was revolutionary for it's time, and presented a unique experience which was fairly lacking at the time.  In 2016 the game feels very dated.  Considering video games aren't wine being dated isn't a good thing.  So I'd say it's probably a 6/10.  Not a great game but certainly not a bad game either, far greater choices exist in 2016 which were absent in 2008.I'll recommend this game as it's the game which started the Assassin Creed franchise, and most people like myself just can't hop into a series in the middle.  So be Leary if you buy the game you may very well find yourself going gah, I have to do this again?  Just suck it up and plow through, the second game is only 15 - 17 hours away...

												The first entry in an annual franchise from Ubisoft and the most unique. Unlike the sequels this game is far from the open world collectathon that the Assassin's Creed series has become. The majority of the game is fairly linear and consists entirely of assasssinating specific characters. Completing the assassinations progresses the plot and unlocks new abilities for you, this game is far more similar to something like Hitman than what the modern Assassin's Creed games are. Unfortunately there are plenty of faults in this one too. The side activities are almost non existent and by adding fast travel between cities eliminates the majority of the open world exploration in this game. This game is also very guilty of not explaining a lot of the mechanics to the player and providing very poor tutorials. However I still think it's a very unique and interesting game despite all of it's flaws. One of the things I really enjoy about it is the fact that you can play through the entire game with all of the on screen HUD disabled only relying on ingrame visual and audio queues.Definitely worth the going price now.

												First game in the Assassin's Creed series and well worth playing even if you've already played the later ones. You need to assassinate certain targets. First, you need to gather information about your surroundings. Then, you need to gather information about your assassination target. Once you have gathered enough information, you can go and assassinate your target (how you do that is up to you and the information you gathered).You can also explore the wonderful big cities and interact with many guards and civilians.

												The first Assassin's Creed was the most promising game in development, and shined brightly from every games exhibition. When it was released, though, the hyped expectations of the whole gaming world were... turned down, sadly.While without a doubt that was a high-class, AAA product, with prodigious depth of open-world gaming experience, fascinating visuals, thoroughly reconstructed medieval cities and intriguing story. Yet all that was not enough. The creators of Assassin's Creed made almost everything right... but lose the fun-out-of-the-gameplay somewhere on producing stages.I remember playing the game right after release, and I was grown tired of it in second city, no matter how much I was stunned by the prologue and the first city. Inglorious Re-Peeat-Ability is the thing that killed the hype of the game and downgraded its undoubted merits. The most usual Ubisoft story, as it seems.But, as we look now, after the dust is settled, the first Assassin game was not bad. Quite contrary, it is still pleases us with visual feast. The reconstruction of medieval world is one of the best in known fiction worlds, would that be games, books or films. The fighting theme is ten times bested by the Shadow of Mordor title... but it is still engaging. Stealth is no match in terms of cunning and diversity with games like Hitman... But you know that too, you get used to it so long ago!So, that that's I'm gonna tell you: if you've missed that game so far, try it now, it is definetely worth a shot. Just... don't play it like an open-world game. I can't believe I write something like that, being a huge fan on open-world gameplay, but in case of AC1 that's the point. There are just not enough rewards for the whole additional activity Ubisoft added in the game. No point in opening chests, collecting flags, and so on. That's that killed my fun when I was making my first approach there.Just play the scenario missions and kill occasional tampliers on your way, while exploring and sightseeing the great cities which was putted into that game. As I said already, there are no other thing, which will give you so complex experience of life in the medieval Mid-East. Just for that Assassin's Creed 1 deserves a place in your games collection, aside from a fact it was a father for superb Assassin's Creed 2, which stands proudly as one of the best games ever created.My mark 7.5. Not a diamond, but still glimmering and even shines, if you know, how to look at it.			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

												An absolutely fantastic, one of a kind, unique game... if you play it with HUD turned off. I explain it in detail here: https://stanislavcostiuc.com/2016/03/02/hud-less-design-of-assassins-creed-1/But the short gist of it, AC1 was clearly designed to be played without a HUD (except some of the missions that were added in the PC version, they didn't take HUD-less design into account), and it provides a whole different experience. As an example, you're not going to an eavesdrop icon to listen to a minute of conversation and that's it, mission done. You're going to the Jewish Quarter because that's where the Rafiq told you there might be information, and you find the Jewish Quarter by seeing in the distance the Star of David on a gateway, while you're on the rooftop, and then you explore and use your Eagle Vision to see who knows something.As soon as the HUD is introduced, a lot of this is lost, and the cyclic nature of the game is seen (which is why a lot of people call the game repetitive, because HUD makes the cyclic nature obvious, but without it you NEED it to learn patterns and to investigate what's out of the pattern).Even if you've played and like the game already, but have never played it with HUD fully off... do it. It won't be a perfect HUD-less experience on PC (mainly because, as I mentioned, new PC missions don't take HUD-less design into account, but you can ignore those because not every mission is required for game completion), but it will still be great and unique.

PROS:+ interesting story+ cool mix between historical settings and Animus UI+ huge map (after unlocking the areas)+ horse riding+ assassination missions+ smooth combat with impressive combos+ no uPlayCONS:- falling into water kills you- after a while the guard fighting gets repetitive- progress save system- graphical glitches- bad video card optimization- audio can go out of sync in rare occassionsComment:A somewhat crude and at times clunky introduction to the series. But I really liked it. Why? Well the story is okay, but the assassinations, THOSE take the cake. Not all are equally good but all felt satisfying. The combat is fun as well although having to battle guards over and over can get repetitive after a while. The later ugrades that Altair gets make the combat even better. Falling into water kills you in this game which is rather immersion breaking (why would a trained assassin not be able to swim?) but not game breaking. The horse riding is cool although sometimes the horses handle poorly. Many people do not like the Desmond timeline but I do, it adds flavour to the story. Overall a cool game that has some bugs and boring/annoying parts which get mostly negated by the smooth combat and assassination system. Recommended!			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

""You're a young arrogant assassin who got himself into a whole lot of troubles after a mission gone outrageously wrong..."" - that would make a pretty good start for any sort of story, and Assassin's Creed is no exception.(Rightfully) blamed for the death of one assassin and crippling of another, Altaïr is given one last chance to redeem himself.On his quest to find inner peace (and assassinate a bunch of Templars along the way), he learns the rather unsettling meaning behind the Assassins' motto that ""nothing is true and everything is permitted"".If, for whatever reason, you never gave this awesome game a try, you should do so.

												This remains the only Assassin's Creed game that I ever enjoyed, also the only ""Almost"" historically correct one too.When the assassin ancestors turns into arrogant italians, and other random nationalities in the new games, instead of the cold blooded silent killer Altaïr from the Middle east, I simply vomit.The Franchise became so popular, that it ruined the continued series. This Assassin's creed though, is not any of that. It remains a pearl in the evolution of games in everyway.			",638,153,5,57,36,4,73

Posted: March 19
												Author's Note: I've been a fan of Assassin's Creed for around 4 years and I recently decided to replay the entire series so, here goes my review for the very first game. The one that started it all. Back before naval combat, Ezio, hook blades, and yes, even before two hidden blades came Assassin's Creed (1). Assassin's Creed follows the story of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad as he seeks to regain his assassin rank. Like the future games, this one takes place in a historic setting, this one's Jerusalem during the Crusades. Before I dive into the setting and scenery, let's first talk gameplay mechanics. So, the game gradually gives you back your original weapons, as well as skills. The weapons include a sword, dagger, throwing knifes, and of course the hidden blade. The combat is pretty good in the first one, but it's definitely improved through the years. You can block attacks, counter, and dodge. Now, if you're used to the newer games, you'll find the hidden blade a little different than what you're used to. The hidden blade can't really be used in a fight, it's only really for sneaking up on enemies. The sword combat is fairly good, but like I've stated before, they've improved throughout the series. One thing that may disappoint you is the lack of the crossbow that you see in the trailer. Sadly, the crossbow was cut out due to the fact that it made assassinations easier, but you'll do fine without it. Now, you've got all of you weapons so, you need something to use them on. As you go through the game, you are tasked with gathering information and killing targets chosen by the master of the Assassins. This is done in different ways, and in different locations. First, you'll have to go up to a viewpoint and sync in order to see your choices. Usually, you have to complete three of these tasks to gather enough information for the kill. This information can actually be pretty useful and makes killing your target easier. These tasks kind of feel like mini-games and they're pretty fun! There's pickpocketing, gathering flags, and even killing targets. There's more than that, but I'll let you explore the other options. Okay, so you've got all of the intel, now it's time for the kill! Your targets vary from either sneaking into their base of operations and (trying to) stealthily kill them or dueling them. If you fail at stealth, then you'll probably either have to duel them or chase after them (Just depends on how much they value their lives). This is pretty fun and never really gets boring. In reality, the game is a little repetitive, but to be honest, it never really felt that way for me. Just enjoy the moment. Alright, so we've talked about assassinating big targets, now let's talk about their little henchmen. As you go through the game, you'll fight a variety of enemies, such as: guys with swords, heavy armor guys, guys with bows, guys with maces, and so on. The combat really isn't that hard and it doesn't take much to get used to it. The enemy A.I is fairly good, but sometimes a little laughable. They do sometimes pose a challenge though, which is always fun. Oh, and just like you, they can't swim! Looks like you're not that different from them deep down. So far, we've covered killing, killing, and...ah...well, more killing! Now on to the scenery. So, the game takes place during the times of the Crusades (hench all of the Templars) in the area, and even in, Jerusalem. The cities you'll visit are fairly large and full of life. You'll usually see at least 4 people, usually a fair bit more, in most areas on the streets. The cities look great for its time and the game runs rather smoothly. How do you get to the cities though? Well, you'll eventually unlock the fast traveling system, which means you'll travel...fast. It's not too different from the one you'll find in AC 2, but you won't need a boat. As soon as you run out of the Assassin HQ, you'll get the option to fast travel. If you'd rather see the world for yourself, you can always travel by horse. Now, on to the last bit of stuff. So, the voice acting's pretty darn good, even if Altair has an American accent for some reason...you get used to it though. The graphics, like I said, are pretty great. Even the soundtrack is pretty great, it provides even more tension to tense situations! Overall, this is a really great game! If you haven't played any of the Assassin's Creed games before, this is a great starting point. You'll really appreciate the newer mechanics in the later games. If you've already played some AC games and not this one, this is a great chance to see what you missed! It may not be the best Assassin's Creed game ever *cough* *cough* Assassin's Creed 2 *cough* but it's definitely a great start to an amazing franchise.			",126,15,1,4,5,0,2

												Great game back in its time. Still a great game by today's standards. The gameplay is smooth and (usually) intuitive. You might notice that the game's primary SKU is for a console by the menu style. It's a little off-putting,  but once you actually get into the game, you forget about it and focus on the story or the missions. If you're using a gamepad, you probably won't notice. The voice acting is superb and the views and vistas are breathtaking. The environments are wonderfully immersive and keep you interested in the story.This game is worth its current price of $20. If you haven't played it, you're missing out.			",111,16,0,18,14,0,28

												This assassin's creed is the classic. It might not be the best. Graphics look pretty much outdated, controls are a bit clunky (as they got redesigned in the newer games). Story wise is fairly short and not very eventful. It almost feels like a prequel of the Desmond's story (first 5 AC games till ACIII). Though, it has that unique feel how this title really should be. You play as a ""real asssassin"" not a pirate, not a thief, not a mobster. You're just pure ancient assassin in this game. Obey the sacred creed (it's Hashashin assassins vs Crusader templars in 1191), recieve order from your master, ride a horse the another city your target's located (no fast travel at all), go to assassin hidout and get more information/plan, eliminate the target, escape and go back to the headquater the inform the result.

												So this is where it all began, the first AC...Please keep in mind that this game now is almost 10 years old, and it is showing it's age. So if you have played more recent ACs and want to check out the very first one, be prepared for some major differences. However, the game still looks nice... it's colorful, the animations still look cool and it's still fun to run around in Damasc, Accra and Jerusalem. Some differences though:- The parcouring/freerunning works quite well, but it's pretty...clunky compared to that in, say, Unity or Syndicate. So accidents will happen, you will experience some misjumps and will prolly fall a couple of times. Still, it can be quite fun.- The combat system is a bit spammy. Mostly, you hit x to strike and, while holding the block-button (shoulder button on a controller), hit x as well to block and counter-strike.At first, combat is rough, but with each sequence, you learn more abilities (or get them back), so you can fight more efficiently, and a counter-strike will often result in one-shotting a mob.- You have your sword, throwing knifes (which you can fight with), your fists and the hidden blade (which you can't fight with really, it's only used for stabbing people who are unaware), that's it... no smoke bombs, rope darts, guns, bows, xbows etc. It's limited, but that does not bother me much.- The cinematics/conversations are rather long, and can not be skipped. However, if you play this for the very first time, that's ok, as it's interesting to listen and learn about the story and background. - There are some bugs and glitches... occasionally, you'll die when you hit a haystack, which of course is a bug. - The sequences are a bit repetitive... climb towers to find activities, do those to gather information on your target, report to your fellow assassin at the bureau, then head for the assassination of the target. It's like that until the end of the game.- There is some side activity, but not as much as in recent games. No money, no purchasing of gear upgrades etc.The game is showing it's age, and of course, AC II later hit the ball out of the park, BUT:I still think that, if you like the franchise, you should play this first one at least once to see the start of the series. It's not all that long, and I think it's still a fun game with a lot of atmosphere and a wonderful soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. And to be frank, I enjoyed replaying this much more than the most recent, IMO horrible Syndicate, and even the very spammy combat in AC I is better than the one in that new game. So... check it out. It's old, has quite a few flaws and is missing a lot of the things more modern ACs had, but it's a great start to the series. I REALLY REALLY recommend to use a controller though! I played all of them with a controller, but especially for this one, I don't think you'll get much out of it if you try to play it with kbm. 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut EditionIt's hard to deny: Assassin's Creed was a game changer. I was obsessed with this game when it came out, and having just replayed it recently, I can say that it's withstood the test of time rather well. For those of you that prefer the controller to the keyboard, this solution was a big help for me.Pros:Simple but effective, history-based storyline (with classic cliffhanger);Non-negligible freedom in tackling each assassination thanks to original gameplay mechanics;Locking main quests pending side quest progression is a good way to contextualise the latter;Original locales rendered in surprising detail;Escaping foes by breaking the line of sight is easily one of the most thrilling aspects of the game;Fast-travel is a welcome option to be able to focus on the storyline;DC adds additional side quests for a bit of variation; The graphics hold up rather well for a 2007 game, with the various settings expected on PC.Cons:The Kingdom is impressively vast but ultimately feels redundant;Investigation has little impact on how you actually tackle any given target;Uninspired collectibles.

												I ""sort of"" recommend this game. There should really be a neutral buttom, because 2017, this game is a bit ""meh"".See, when I first played assassin's creed, way back when it was first released, I was blown away by how beautiful the game was, and how awesome it was to be able to freerun. My entire first playthrough was just me being mesmerized by how awesome it was to be able to move more or less how you want to. But as I went to replay this game a second time, a year after my first playthrough, it was a lot less appealing. Now, many years later, I replay this game here on steam, and I can look at the game with a fresh set of eyes.Playing assassin's game the first time is sort of like having a summer fling on a festival or concert when you're in your early teens. You're blown away by how good they look, and how much in common you have, and how awesome and open they are. But they're really only good for that summer fling, beause the whole infatuation is shallow and lacks content. That's what assassin's creed is to me. It still looks good after all these years... But behind the polished surface, there isn't a whole lot to be attracted yo. There's tons of bugs in spite of all time that has gone by, and the controls is clunky and unwieldy. You are still asked at time to do things which will be hard not because it's hard, but because you can't really make the controls do what you want them to. Did you enter a ladder at a weirld camera angle? Now W on your keyboard doesn't make the main character go up, but instead down. Did you run too close to a bench while being pursued by guards? Now your character will sit on it instead of keep running. Did you enter combat? Now your character will draw his sword, even if you would prefer another weapon and had a different weapon drawn.These are just loose examples. Assassin's Creed is packed with these issues. Sometimes, carrying out certain missions is not a delight, but a chore, because you are aware that while you can come up with a good plan for how to perform the mission, the most likely reason you will fail it, is because of a bug. Not because of game difficulty or something similar, but because there are still issues with the game and when the game is sporting an ancient save system, it means replaying large contents of the game over and over.Well on to other things.The main character is both believeable and unfortunatley a bit boring. As an assassin, taking lives every other day, you can imagine that someone must become hard on the inside to cope with the problems. It takes a certain type of person to do those things, and even if you're not bent on murder in particular, that sort of life will likely bend your mind to a single purpose - the cause. So Altair is not a deep person, he doesn't seem to have a background which would be interesting to explore, and he doesn't have any meaningful personal relationships either. He sort of just... Goes through life, assassinating people, because that's who he is. And that's great. It's believable to me. But it's also boring. I never felt that I got to know Altair, I don't really know who he is outside of his knife stabbing personna. And that is a bit of a shame. Ubisoft does a better job with later iterations of assassin's creed and its characters.The story is forgettable. There's a story twist, but you can spot it coming long long before it's ""revealed"" to the character. There's not a whole lot of side missions beside the main story, and for being a free roam game... There's not much to roam in. I mean, the maps are huge but... There's just you, the main story and some side missions to help you succeed with the main story, and ten million billion collectibles. Alright, not that many. But still, Ubisoft sure tried to fluff replayability of the game by having a lot of flags one can collect.In either case, since the game is now pretty cheap, I do recommend it. But I advise seeing it as a prequel to the story about Ezio Auditore, which is the protagonist in the next three games (assassin's creed 2, assassin's creed: brotherhood, and assassin's creed: revelations), rather than a game of its own.

The game still has a fascinating and well thought out story with good replayable gameplay. This game also has awesome graphics and cool cutscenes.

 Introduction Assassin's Creed, takes place during the Third Crusade.You play as Altaïr ibn-La'Ahad, the Assassin who breaks all three tenets of the Brotherhood.Altaïr then gets demoted to Novice being tasked with assassinating the nine Knights Templars to regain his former status.First of it's series, Assassin's Creed bring you a new type of genre for the gaming industry. Categories GameplayCombatStoryGraphicsOptimizationBugsPersonal ExperienceProsConsConclusion Gameplay Assassin's Creed revolves around combat, parkour and, stealth.You must run/ride long distances to get to your destination, you cannot swim.The parkour seems to be restricted, though being the first Assassin's Creed game: it's to be expected. Combat The combat in this edition of Assassin's Creed is quite annoying.You could be walking around somewhere, and out of nowhere an civilian starts punching you. Nothing you do will get rid of the civilian without running away, thus having a guard notice you and have a bunch come after you. Guards will also notice you, if the civilian hits you.General combat is decently fluent.You get into a fight with a bunch of guards and counter-attacking seemed best.When you try to block guards and, they are behind you, sometimes it won't let you block them which gets very annoying.Combat is basically just pretty basic, nothing special.StoryUnfortunately, the story was not interesting, and I found myself rushing to complete it.You go back and forth from the ""Assassin's Den"" and whichever city you are in to assassinate a target.When you get sent after a target, it gets confusing on what to do, and where to go.The dialog in the game is rather boring, and has no real point to focus on it.Towards the end of the game, it gets interesting. Graphics Considering the game is from 2007, the graphics aren't overwhelming.For my playthrough, I downloaded a graphics mod and played in DSR 4k 60fps.The game looked margionally better like this. Optimization The optimization in this game is poor.Frame rate stutters from 60 to 59 occasionally.Crashes at random points, and minimizing will resort in odd coloring. Bugs Enemies will attack you even when you block them.Assassinating someone with your knife, doesn't always work correctly. Personal Experience Rather boring experience, found myself rushing until the end.Smooth gameplay experiences with some crashes.Decent game for it's time. Pros Decent game.Has parkour.It's Assassin's Creed. Cons Boring.Micro-stutters.Crashes.Repetitive.Slow paced. Conclusion It's a pretty solid game, and it was a great way to start off the series.The Assassin's Creed games built up greatly from this one with large improvements.Get it, and be able to try out the first of the franchise.

This is the game that got me to buy several series of the game that I have yet to finish because of the sheer tasks and objectives that I want to get and accomplish.  But like I said, this game started it all.  The first installment of an amazing game series.  All of the AC games, nothing beats the original and no Uplay by Ubisoft before you start the game.

												As an AC-fan you should definitely get the initial game, even though the graphics are worse than in the recent games.Why would that be a problem, if you can run around in a huge, oriental Open World and♥♥♥♥♥♥Templars?There is alot to be done and a lot of fun to be had with this game.The only thing I can fault this game for, is the Stealth system.. Either every guard and soldier is equipped with eyes on their back and a sense of hearing similar to that of a lynx, or I straightout am the worst player ever.Well and the usual cons of every game in the series: except for fakn Unity  yey ^-^- You are a Master Assassin but unable to sneak. The only way to stealth really is to pretend not be    an assassin.- And you are a Master Assassin, with perfect gear and had years of schooling. Still every single guard or soldier, no matter how minor their training was and how crappy their skills should be,is able to climb buildings and leap about on rooftops, just as agile as you, regardless how heavy their armor is. I know it would probably make the game too easy if they could not do that, but it would make more sense.Still I love the whole franchise and the first game is definitely worth mentioning.(I am also having some troubles with the Fullscreen-mode, but that is probably because of my own incompetence.)9/10			",65,9,0,8,11,0,1

												The first game in the Assassin's Creed series is the game you should either start the series with, or go into with lower expectations. That's not to say this game is bad, it's just one that has sequals which far exceed the original.Advertising itself as a ""next-gen"" (beginning of Xbox 360/PS3 era) game, in retrospect this game definitely looks (emphasis on the ""looks"") that way. Set in the 12th century during the Third Crusade, AC1 tells the tale of an underground battle between two opposing factions that has gone on since the begginnings of our species, and you play as Altair, a member of the Assassin Order. The plot is not the most exciting part of the game, but the ideas about human nature were enough to keep me interested into it to a certain extent. The characters are forgetable, besides our protagonist. Altair is a rather brash Assassin who fails a mission in the opening act of the game, and this game details his journey to get back to his previous rank within the Assassin Order. Besides the out of place American accent (ugh), Altair is a rather badass and interesting protagonist who keeps the plot afloat.On the other hand, the world which the game is sent in is rich and engrossing. The graphical quality greatly reflects the world of the Crusade, and cities are full of NPC's which go about on their day. The sheer size of the maps will surely impress if this is your first AC game. Immersion is also something this game nails on the head, despite its numerous flaws. The soundtrack may not be entirely memorable, but it nonetheless fits the game extremly well. Voice work (minus Altair) is definitely of a high quality and fits in as well. However, do not look to this game as a history lesson that is 1:1 with reality. This game does take history and makes it fit into a video game, and isn't entirely accurate (which the game acknowledges). This goes into a part of the game that is really up to opinion when it comes to the story: You're actually reliving the memories Altair, who is the ancestor of our true protagonist Desmond. Here you meet Lucy and Videc, one of which is a rather bland assistant character, while the other is an evil scientist. While these characters came across as rather boring to me, Desmond's character really makes them seem like works out of Shakespear. Desmond is an EXTREMLY bland character, and one that I honestly didn't care about. The game pulls your out of the Animus (the device used to relive memories) after every chapter, and these segmants are real pacebrakers, despite some interesting conversations between Desmond and Videc here and there. Another issue I have withe the games story is how abrupt the ending is, and a plotpoint that comes up near the end of the game without explanation and just feels like it's there to break immersion and be picked up later on. While I wont go into details, the game definitely makes it feel as if it NEEDS to have a sequal, whether you as the player likes it or not.While it may seem as if I hate this game, I must say I actually did have an enjoyable experience with the gameplay. Sure, the game is repititive with the same objective structure being true for 85% or so of the game: Complete 3 missions, and assassinite your target. While this may definitely be a problem for some, the gameplay does work quite well to break this problem apart.A staple of Assassins Creed is its parkour and stealth mechanics, and both are present and enjoyable to do here. Soaring across the games three cities is enjoyable, and stealth can be very rewarding in the game as it is quite difficult to pull off compared to the sequals. Combat is also very rich, and has many sides to it (even though it becomes pathetically easy with counters). You can dodge, block, grab, and slash at your opponents with various tools at your disposal: a sword, a shortsword, throwing knives, and the iconic hidden blade (and also your fists, of course). The objectives your are required to complete before assassinations are quite repepitive however, and may be something you may not enjoy. I personally found informer challaneges to be very tricky, while pickpockets and interrogations were far too easy. And eavesdropping is... well... sitting on a bench, and that's that. Assassinations are, however, very enjoyable and can be done in a variety of manners, and are followed by extremly intense escpae sequences that will keep you on your toes.While there are some optional activities (saving civilians, collect-a-thons, and scaling every viewpoint), the game doesn't offer too much else. and is purely an action adventure game rather than an RPG (like its sequals). This is why Assassin's Creed is honestly a game that doesn't have too much replay value, even though the adventure is about 15 hours and is overall enjoyable, if not repitive for 85% of the journey and telling of a story that isn't too memorbale, despite the immersive world presented. $20 may be a bit too much for how shallow AC1 is (and considering you can buy the more polished sequals for the same price), and if you're curious I would advice that you wait for this to go on sale and to have an open mind. However, the game should keep you entertained enough to be interested in AC2, which is definitely a GOOD thing.Overall, AC1 is a decent first game into the AC franchise, and one you should approach with some caution, and avoid if you've played the other AC games (unless you're extremly curious). I would give this game an overall 7/10, however if I had to take replayability into account it's definitely a 6/10.			",62,5,0,11,8,0,13

												First Assassin's Creed game I played and... I'm glad I did. I read the book first so I knew the story before playing it, damn. I love Altair. (ihugege <3)I won't talk about the story, you can read the game description. Graphics: Good I'd say for a game that already has 7 years if I'm not mistaken, I loved the animations during the synchronizations, well done. You can judge it yourself with playthroughs or trailers if you don't want any spoil.OST: Didn't enjoy all of them, but it probably just suits the game as it should, the best one for me was Acre, the others are still good tho. Gameplay: Ruuuunnn, climmmmbb, juuuuummp, that part was so much fun. Sometimes I was just wandering from place to place without any reasons because I enjoyed doing so. As for combat, you have 4 differents weapons depending on how you like to play. I loved sneaking in and using the hidden blade. You also get to learn new techniques (like counter hehe) so it helps you to fight faster and easier.Overall: I loved it (and that end !!!) Altair is the best assassin for sure, he evolves so much through the game.This is my opinion, now play and GET YOUR OWN, you probably won't regret it anyway.			",41,12,0,4,3,0,0

												Assassin's Creed™: Director's Cut Edition is an action adventure game set in The Holy Land during The Third Crusade 1191 AD.You're Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a skilled, but very arrogant assassin. Because of this, you failed your most important mission, and soon, your glory, turned into blame. Now, to redeem yourself, you must kill who your master, Al Mualim, tells you to, and with that, finally bring peace to the Holy Land. But,  Why these men? What were their intentions? What is their sin? What if you're wrong?It's repetitive, frustrating, it can't stand to its successors, but, it's still playable, and a must play for any fan of the series.★★★★☆ | Liked it ",1105,403,22,130,65,14,117

You play as Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, the assassin who founded the Order of the assassins. As Altaïr, you have to uncover the secrets of the creed and the mysterious apple of eden, while fighting against your enemies, the templar! It is a good game on it's own, but definatly not as good as it's sequels, since you can't even air-assassinate people here. This game clearly isn't made for a Pc Keyboard, but for consoles, so I suggest you get a Gamepad to play with before you play this game with the frustrating controls of the Pc version.5/10			",142,8,4,8,3,1,3

												Assassin's Creed is a very strong game that will satisfy individiuals that love history and war, but also the real main story of Assassins Creed.Setting: The game is set in the Third Crusade times, the battle between Islam and Christianity. It features Desmond Miles, a protagonist in 21st Century America, which is kidnapped by the antagonist company Abstergo Industries. This company uses the Animus, a generic-memory stimulator, on Desmond to recall his memories through his ancestor Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad. The cities involved are Masyaf, the assassin creed's home city, Acre, ran by the Knights Templars, and Jerusalem and Damascus, both cities ran by the Templars and enemy Saracens. There is one more city however I won't spoil it. The landscape is different for each city, but only noticable in each city. There are three districts, poor, middle, and rich district, and you would assume there are higher quality buildings as the districts become richer, but again, you can only notice them.Plot: The plot line is certainly intriguing. Having played AC II, Brotherhood, and Revelations, and having not finished AC I, all the storylines from the sequels made actual sense once I completed this. Onto the plot though, there are two separate plots that do intertwine. To clarify that, there is the story of Desmond and the story of Altair and the plotlines intertwine through the story of Altair and Desmond mashing in present 21st century America (hard to explain I know). Just know, the plot makes absolute sense once you play the games. From the perspective of AC's release in 2007, it was very very intriguing to interpret the plot without knowing the sequel storylines, so the plot from that perspective is a massive plus. The finish was very surprising as well might I mention.Also, I completed the game in 18 hours, which included the core plot and the main side-missions. I did not complete finding the flags and killing the templar guards as I found them to be irrelevent. I had only played 14.9 hours on Steam, however 18 hours came from I playing about 3.5 hours of the game and me realising after three hours that Steam didn't realise I was playing AC, so there was a glitch in the Steam Client.Only nuisences regarding the plot is the side-missions. As you progress into the game, they become more of a chore than actual for fun, for example, when there is an investigation side mission, the guards keep on coming later in the game and is ridiculous as they are alert, and spot you without even looking at you, meaning you failed the investigation. So yes, there was a few unbalanced AI involved with the missions, but other than that, it relieves you in the end once you know all are completed.And to note, I realised why I got so bored of the game about three hours into it on my first playthrough last year, and that was because the horse riding from Masyaf to the other cities is so long, it would take at least 15 minutes to travel, ridiculous and boring especially when 'The Kingdom' is just a transition area with no real meaning.Gameplay: Gameplay is very solid. For a game released in 2007, it is surprising to see how smooth the gameplay is. For a game that emphasises parkour and combat, I see it as a major positive adding to the game. Only negatives regarding gameplay is how basic some actions are. For example, you will notice the same amount of counters to attacks and blocks, something that I felt could have been explored further.Sound/Dialogue/Graphics: The graphics are very good for a 2007 game. I praise that. Dialogue is good as there is mostly variety in individual dialogues. Only negative for dialogue is the 'Save Citizens' missions, the dialogue is extremely repeatitive. There was also some minor speech issues that I had noticed. Sound: Serviceable. There was rare audio issues that I encountered.Negatives: This review may seem very positive, but gee these negatives are really that annoying. Overall, there are several bugs and glitches I'll name a few, for 'Save Citizens' missions, you would get glitches where you could not trigger the person to speak to after completing the task. Another was camera's getting stuck on the player, especially moderately when walking through doors, completely annoying. Overall: A very solid game and a good first-entry to the Assassins Creed series. If you didn't bother reading the review, the plot was consistent and intriguing, the graphics were very good, the sound was servicable, the dialogue was good, and gameplay was very solid. There were several bugs and glitches within the game that completely nagged me. The game is currently worth $10 on Steam, I'd say buy it, no harm done, sets up the good foundation for the series. Now, the rating is low compared to what I mentioned in the review as it was not an excellent game by all means. 7.5/10EDIT: I didn't note, but since the game took me 18 hours to complete, for the individual, I would assume it would take 20+ hours to complete by doing all tasks.----Thanks for reading my review!

Introduction: Initially published by Ubisoft in 2007, Assassin’s Creed is the under-appreciated foundation of the critically acclaimed franchise. It is an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. While this fluid and beautiful game is often the victim of mixed reviews by fans, it serves a very important purpose. The first time I tried this game, I put it down as a result of becoming bored too quickly, but this game is worth investing in. That is, if you have taken a shine to any of its sequels. It is my strong and undying opinion that you’d be doing the developers a great disservice by skipping the heart of the best selling series. While the later games are more entertaining and hold more appeal, one needs to play Assassin’s Creed in order to truly understand the elaborate groundwork laid out for its successors. Story: The game focuses on the use of an immersive computer system known as the “Animus”, and its latest subject called Desmond Miles. While Desmond may appear to be an average bartender from an average world, he is actually a descendant of the legendary Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La’Ahad. Through the Animus, the player will bear witness to the genetic memories of Desmond’s ancestor, and the events between two secret societies as they unfold during the Third Crusade. Overall, I felt that the story was weak, but it took some revolutionary steps towards creating a solid foundation for a marvelous series of sequels. While the story might initially seem confusing as the player nears the end, it is surprisingly well thought out, so give it a chance.Gameplay: As stated previously, much of the game is disclosed through the eyes of Desmond Miles as he relives the memories of Altaïr through the Animus. Inside the Animus, the player will be introduced to a computerized interface displaying all of the mandatory information varying from health to inventory, and a third person view of Altaïr.It is important for anyone unfamiliar with the franchise to be aware that Altaïr moves in real time opposed to turn-based. The  movement in the game is possibly its most notable feature which permits the player to scale buildings, catch ledges, jump over gaps, and more. Assassin’s Creed has a love for utilizing a diverse set of active (high profile) and passive (low profile) approaches, so if you manage to draw unwanted attention to yourself, you’re probably going to need to find a haystack - fast - unless you feel like fighting a band of poor unfortunate souls (otherwise known as guards).Unfortunately, even with easy access to multiple weapon sets and various combat skills, the gameplay of Assassin’s Creed can only be described as repetitive. The game makes a habit of recycling the same formula for most of the key assassinations, which becomes tedious. Despite that, it’s still worth buying - If this is too repetitive, simply rush through this game. There is a lot more to do in its successors, and the developers improve the ability to enjoy the tasks in the future. However, as I stated, skipping the groundwork does the entire franchise a bit of a disservice.Furthermore, as Altaïr the player will also need to familiarize themselves with the art of synchronization. Synchronization is measured by the Animus as Desmond follows his genetic memories, and reflects its user’s faithfulness to the memory in question. In other words, is Desmond re-living the memory as it was, or has he diverted from its path? Straying too far from the objective will result in a loss of synchronization, which will result in forcing the user to start over from an earlier point. Needless to say, not “everything is permitted”. Finally, the last aspect that I really feel called to touch on is Eagle Vision. In short, Eagle Vision is a seemingly dormant sixth sense in most humans, however it manages to aid Altaïr in his tasks throughout the game. Utilized, this ability will help the player to locate targets, gauge intentions of others, and ultimately seek out his mark. I found this aspect to be fairly interesting, and hope you enjoy using this ability as much as I did.Controls: The controls of Assassin’s Creed are extremely friendly. I used my 360 controller, and the game provided me with excellent controller support. However, I did try to play the game with the mouse and keyboard setup, and I cannot recommend this to anyone. This game is best played with a controller. In general, the targeting is a bit tricky, but that is something you can work around.Graphics: As I stated at the beginning of the review, I tried playing Assassin’s Creed once before. What I failed to mention was that my first attempt was on the XBOX 360 years ago. On the 360, the game looked polished and pretty. However, it’s original appeal has nothing on the dreamlike quality of the graphics on the PC. I could hardly believe that the game was originally released in 2007 when I first booted it up. Sure, there are some technical glitches here and there, but the PC version has definitely left a deeper impression.I feel like it is an understatement to report that the views in Assassin’s Creed are breathtaking. In fact, they are polished, atmospheric, realistic, and lifelike. It is absolutely fascinating to me how well Ubisoft managed to present the world in this game. Sound: In Assassin’s Creed, you will come to hate that one stupid beggar that manages to find you in every single town, who just absolutely has to tell you “My family is sick and dying”... What I’m really trying to say, is that the continuously recycled voice tracks are just as repetitive as the gameplay itself. If it doesn’t annoy you, I envy you your patience. With a bit more polishing (and perhaps a few more lines recorded by their voice actors) the NPCs could have been a much enjoyable thing to encounter.On a positive note, the music is gorgeous. Overall the sounds of Assassin’s Creed are realistic and immersive, fitting for a game that places a heavy focus on its atmosphere.Replay Value: I’m not sure I’d play it again, unless I wanted a refresher of the story, but it is definitely worth at least one playthrough. As always, the replay value is entirely dependent on the individual holding the controller, and I can see a great deal of replay potential in this game. While the story is questionably weak, there are a lot of remaining individual elements to explore and to enjoy - Particularly if you enjoy exploration and immersive combat.			",83,20,0,36,0,0,0

												Personal Rating: 5.5 of 10One of the most solid and stable Assassin's Creed game (up till III) in terms of performance. Its really cool to be jumping around roof tops doing parkour and killing people with awesome animation. It is also very unique and smart on how the game incorporates modern technologies into a game set in the medieval time.Although the settings are really nice, the game don't really feel immensive. Example, rooftops and buildings are repetitive so you actually stop paying attention to them and refer to the minimap to get to your location. Combat is okay as they try to design it to be realistic as possible when taking several enemies at the same time but can be slow. The NPCs are there to make the city feels alive but that is it. They are like zombies wandering around.Missions are repetitive. I actually reinstalled this game three times before progressing half-way or so because every mission does not have much room for exploitation for an assassin game. Even if your presence is made known before killing your target, it simply means you are going to have a tougher time getting away and each mission feels more like a puzzle than an assasination mission. Also, based on my understanding, assassination are suppose to be done discreetly and probably when there are less people as possible like night time maybe?Again, side missions are simply there for the sake of existing. Meaning once the game is completed, side missions are fitted in to the game with minimal effort like collectibles, races, deliveries and etcs. The rewards are not that great to start with nor even the stories that comes with the side missions.Weapons and skills are unlocked progressively but it is not that great. I can't even make out the difference between a sword and wrist blade except that killing people with the blade is really stylish and cool.Cities are huge but you need to make several travels between them as the areas are unlocked progressively so yeah visiting the same place over and over again is kind of boring too.Story is quite interesting however do note that the game is not historical accurate. Some references and event timeline may be correct but that is all. I think the progress of the story is alright considering the time it is set in but it is too draggy for me. Not much plot but if they can change the pace of the story and put in more plots it could be really interesting.I think Assassin's Creed is an alright game if sword fights, stealth/puzzle, parkour, conspiracy and assassination in the medieval time is your thing, but don't expect something really hardcore here.

****TL;DR AVAILABLE BELOW****Assassin's Creed is an excellent Historic-Science Fiction Action/Adventure Game mainly inspired by the novel Alamut written by Vladimir Bartol way back in 1938. The Game introduced many brilliant concepts and a totally different mindblowing plot which is very well connected from past to the present and you can devise many theories based on it. It was turned down by many people because it lacked variety and yes it did. I'm gonna list out the positive points between this game and its successors and also the reason why I think it's still an awesome game of the franchise. It had a special charm that none of it's successors had and will ever have.1. The Game is simple and doesn't involve customisation or anything and doesn't feature money,etc to buy stuff and stays true in assassinating your targets. Whereas the other games got deviated into buying stuff and oh god the renovation business started.2. Had some great concepts such as synchronisation for example, its not actually health but how close you (Desmond) could faithfully recreate the actions of ancestor, like if you carelessly fell off from a building or punched some civvy, etc. you lose the synchronisation, because the ancestor didn't do such thing in his life and was careful. It will regain over time and become stable when it is lost.Where as in other games you have health and armor and the way to replenish it is to drink some health tonic. Death in all these games is actually just a bad sync-up where you replayed the ancestor's memory event so bad that you lost touch with the original one's completely, so the Animus reinitialises back to the point where it made sense before you screwed it up entirely. So basically Ezio, etc. actually dies when you run out of it. Checkpoint restart is just a game mechanic. You can say that the Animus is still re-initialising the scene, but you died from lack of health, not loss of synchronization, So the Synchronisation no longer makes sense, so technically it was very well implemented and made some real actual sense in this game. And there are some other concepts which were not only solid and made sense but also gave a definite depth to the game.3. It has darker and gritty atmosphere with well suited background scores as you scour for information about the target in various ways which gives you this 'Assassin' feeling. While the other games had peaceful and relaxing score not stating that they're bad but this one had better and showed how dark and unsafe the world is and was perfect for its Middle-Eastern setting.4. The Chase Theme (Access the Animus as per OST) of this game is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EPIC. ""You are not a bloodthirsty berserker, nor an invincible warrior cutting through waves of guards - you are a blade in a crowd, someone, who doesn't exist...until the blade has pierced your targets throat. As the bells echo throughout the city and the guards draw their swords against you, you realize it is time to run...run and become no one once more.The one thing that the original Assassin's Creed did better than ALL other sequels (everything up to Syndicate) is making you realize when it's time to run.﻿""Source:

(Check the comment section)5. The dialogues are surprisingly deep and interesting, only downside to it was it didn't feature any subtitles and sometimes cannot make out what they are saying because they sometime speak foreign language and won't speak simple english at all.6. Unlike other games where you scale a building like spidey, it is slow paced and that is great because it is realistic, but oh well people are just too impatient. 7. Every assassin in the order abide by the three tenets of the creed as in the game's title. In other games there is no mentioning of the creed and completely lost the meaning of the game's title itself and became a milking title instead.Plot wise, the game is very short without considering the repetition but its really well made and it is just the beginning of the story as it throws you at a cliffhanger at the end. The Visuals are pretty neat too. It was so demanding back then in its time of release and even after all these years, it still really looks good.TL;DRPros:Mindblowing ConceptsEpic storySuperb Graphics in its timeA Great History TeacherRealistic slow paced free running parkourThe Most challenging game in its seriesDeep and interesting dialoguesSound FX, even the tiniest sounds can be heard (Such as while climbing)Dark and Gritty atmosphereOnly AC game which gives you the 'Assassin' feelingWell suited Background scores by Jesper KydCons:Can be awfully repetitiveNumerous collectiblesCan't swim lolSome unwanted parkour glitchesMissing minor features a game should have (ex: blank radar,subs,etc)Repetitiveness cast aside, it's a gem that's pretty rough around the edges but it's sad that many people don't see it that way. Also this is the point where Ubisoft acquired the Tower Fetish Syndrome9/10 ",530,228,22,67,46,7,64

												After over 50 hours into this game, I can honestly say that Assassin’s Creed 1, is a magnificent game. This game is the first one in the series and I have to admit that I do regret my latecoming to the series, but I am glad that I decided to go straight to the beginning rather than AC2, which has been said to more ‘improved’ in lots of areas. I will spilt up my review into a couple of ‘sections’ before giving my overall thoughts and score. Please note that throughout this review, I will try to be as spoiler-free as I can be. Story -The story is the real meat of AC1 and it is the game's strongest point. You, as Desmond Miles, are captured by Abstergo Industries whom wishes to access your genetic memories in order to obtain the memories of Altaïr, whom is Desmond's ancestor and is an Assassin whom you play as while in the Animus - a machine that allows you to access Altaïr's memories. There are a lot of things you don't learn straightaway like why does Abstergo want Altaïr's memories but later on, through Altaïr's storyline and Desmond's, you discover that Abstergo desires something specific found within Altaïr's memories. You begin the game as Altaïr who is in Solomon's Temple with two other Assassins, in a mission to retrieve the Piece of Eden. While there, Altaïr finds Robert de Sable (Grandmaster of the Templars) and attempts to kill him, breaking all the tenets of the Creed with his arrogance. As a result of this, an assassin dies and Masayaf (The Creed's Base) gets attacked by the Templar Order. As this was Altaïr's fault, Al Mualim (Leader of the Assassins) strips Altaïr's rank as a 'Master Assassin' and demotes him into a novice. For the majority of the game, Altaïr is on a mission of redemption and regaining his rank as the only way to do so is to kill nine Templars. Well, the story is much more complex and interesting than that as you learn that these Templars are all tied-together and that Al Mualim didn't choose these nine for the heck of it. Throughout the course of the game, Altaïr learns many things and he undergoes a large character development, in his quest for redemption. The story is engaging and gripping - so much so, at one point, I played three days straight just to learn more on the story. That's how good it was! Characters  - The game has a strong cast of characters in my view (At least in the main story on Altaïr's side) - Altaïr, Al Mualim, Robert de Sable, The Nine Templars, etc etc. All of these are very strong characters with Altaïr's arrogance and Al Mualim's wisdom, which makes the main story ever so interesting and engaging. There are minor things that could have been better like the fact that even though Altaïr is middle-eastern, he has an American accent, which is entirely realistic. Another thing concerning Altaïr is his backstory, as I would have loved to learn more about his character as we learn very little of his past in the game. But now, we shall slip to the other side and talk about Desmond Miles. Desmond Miles, is an 'okay' character in my opinion, I heard a lot about the criticism on his character and storyline, and I can see why as we know very little on Desmond as well (Altaïr is a strong character though, so it works for him) but Desmond in itself is a little bland. We don't see much personality from him and I, found myself, wanting to go back to Altaïr, a lot. I should note that I don't hate Desmond as a character nor his storyline as I saw potential, but I'm unsure if in the other games whether this changes or not. I should also say that towards the end of the game, that was the point when I was interested in his storyline before recieving a large cliffhanger (Thanks, Ubisoft). Gameplay -The gameplay is the biggest flaw in the entire game. Okay, you have three cities to play in - Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Within those three cities, you have three districts - The Poor District, the Rich District and the Middle District. The gameplay connects with the story of killing the Nine Templars - in preparation for the nine Templars, you have to the SAME thing nine times. You have to climb viewpoints within each district in each city to unlock investigations (things like pickpockets, interrogation, eavesdropping etc etc) which helps you acquire enough information to assassinate the target. In the first three targets, you have to do 2 investigations, and for the rest you have to do - 3 investigations. So, you pretty much do the same thing nine times. Climb up high places, unlock investigations, do the required amount of investigations then finally assassinate the target. At first, I thought this was an interesting mechanic and added more immersion to make it seem like how an assassin would really do it - as stealth and information are key, however after doing it numerous of times, I found it repeitive and frustrating. So much so, that I sometimes wished I could cut to the chase and get to the actual killing; thankfully the game makes each Templar unique with interesting and compelling stories. I was patient enough and managed to push myself through the repetitive gamplay solely for the story, and I sincerely hope that the gameplay had been improved upon in AC2 and all of the games in the franchise. Combat  -In AC1, you have 4 choices to fight with - throwing knives/a fighting knife, a hidden blade, a sword and your fists. I myself loved the fact that I could jump around the roof and take out my hidden blade and stab the unsuspecting guards. The controls for fighting are a struggle at first as you have a lot of skills to remember and in combat, you can fumble around and confuse one ability with the other causing you to mess up in combat, but I eventually adapted to it and learned to use it. I could tell from early on, that this game was intended for controllers rather than a mouse-and-keyboard but honestly, it's not ""too hard"" with mouse-and-keyboard but it is a struggle at the beginning, and is one concern that should be addressed as it may not be what certain people would like, so I would recommend you to be patient - take advantage of the fighting tutorials and use them to help you get better at the controls, or if not - use a controller, as the game seemingly wants you too. Setting  - AC1 is set during 1191 - in the middle of the Third Crusade, and the majority of the story takes place within the Holy Land. This was rather a nice and unique place and time to play in, as I didn't know many games that was set in during the Crusades and the Holy Land where King Richard 'the Lionheart' and Salahuddin are in a war with each other, for either the protection of Jerusalem (in Salahuddin's side) or the capture of Jerusalem for Christianity (in King Richard's side). When I first heard about the setting, I was really interested as this was quite a nice place and time to set a game in, and while I admittedly do not know much on the Holy Crusades, I am very interested in history. It should be said that this game shouldn't be played for it's historical context, as obviously it wouldn't be historically-correct but it was a lot of fun to see Jerusalem and see how the Third Crusade affected the Holy Land, so I consider this to be one of the game's strong points. Overall  -Overall, my final verdict for this game is an  8/10  with the game's strengths being it's story, setting and intriuging characters such as Altaïr as well as the fun parkour. However it's major flaws are its repititive gameplay as well as the 'clunky' controls for combat yet I recommend being patient enough to deal with them, as this game has a compelling story and an amazing setting. Thanks for reading! My Scoreboard –1/10 ---> 4/10 – Not worth it.5/10 ---> 6/10 – Below Average/Mediocre.7/10 – Above Average. 8/10 – Great. 9/10 ---> 10/10 – Outstanding + Must Own.

												Eh, still my favorite game in AC story-wise. While all AC stories are good one way or another, I really wish they'd reboot it from the start someday, and fix their ultimate mistake they made with Unity (that rendered their further works - unappreciated, even if actually good). Mechanics are surprisingly good, and story is just amazing.			",112,27,0,14,8,0,3

												This game runs pretty well, it's noticeably dated to me with things popping in and such but I'm sure we can all make allowances for that with the age of the game.If you, like me really want to be playing with keyboard and mouse, and not resorting to a controller, I urge to you take caution over the titles after this one as the camera will drive you mad. They all seem to share some sort of mouse acceleration issue that will make moving the camera with the mouse unplesant and annoying at best. This one does not share those issues, has a fantastic story and the only flaw is the gameplay can be a bit repetitive - certainly a classic regardless of this though!			",82,6,1,10,3,0,6

												Classic frustration, that seems to be the best way I can describe this game. Seriously I wanted to assassinate everyone at Ubisoft going through this game, it WILL make you curse, it WILL make you scream, it WILL make you drown in a puddle of water even though you're a god-like assassin who can jump from insane nosebleed heights, no really it will do that.The thing is I kinda like being frustrated, I kinda like sitting there yelling and cursing at my screen, if I'm not then the game is boring and not worth my time. I've started and stopped playing this game so many times... but I always come back.If you're going to play any of the other Assassin's Creed games, and I recomend that you do, you have to play them from the start. It's a story, one that progresses through the series, and not a bad one. One that is suppose to be made into a movie soon too, a whitewashed version of the story (and please feel free to protest that fact to the company).			",523,101,40,73,65,3,76

												I spent about 20 hours with this game, including the 2+ hours spent replaying major sequences because the game broke. Including the final battle - I had just beaten him and the game crashed, and the restart was a good 20 minutes earlier and had to be replayed.  The technical issues with this game on PC are embarrassing, especially considering how long ago it came out. As for the game itself - it's an open world game that punishes you for exploring the open world - the dichotomy between your range of motion and the responses to the world to your action is really weird, and doesn't support the goal of the game.  The number of activities available is pretty small for this kind of game (climb towers, help citizens in battles, and then some mission-specific tasks that are the same every time). There are flags to gather, for no purpose.  There are templars to kill. For no purpose. It's like they read a guide on how to put an open world game together, but forgot to make it worthwhile.  Which is too bad, because the environments are beautiful, and not something you see in many other games (Middle East in the Crusades era). Fighting isn't horrible, but it isn't great. All the pieces are there, but it doesn't cohere into a very good game; especially in light of the games that have come out since, it doesn't stand up for a return visit.

												Overall, the game was really good and realy drew you in. I got it when it first came out and it was awesome!Pro's: Open world and one that is truly vast and very highly detailed.Gameplay/Mechanics were simple, intuitive and easy to master.Good music and wonderful voice acting. Dunno it's just me or not, but no voice acting oftentimes ruins a game for me save a efw rare exceptions (Star Ocean: The Secord Story, Legend of Legaia, etc.)Adoring the parkour and running method, along with all the architecture built in to incorporate that.Being able to stalk your prey, gut 'em, then walk away as people start to freak was fun.There's plenty of content to make for plenty of game time.There are several small things I won't list, as well, that make interactivity fun and interesting, at the very least. Especially during the cut scenes.Con's: As for being open world, keep in mind that there is a reason you cannot actually explore everywnere at once, but get sections of the full map. I'd say way, but it'd be a spoiler and you learn very early into the game as to what this is about.Sometimes, especially at the start, you may begin getting lost, mini-map or no.Puzzles can be difficult, but not impossible.

												A great start to the franchise. You play Altair, a young assassin full of himself and over confident with his abilities as an assassin. The gameplay is full of repetition, as you move on from one target to the next trying to complete your mission of eliminating the Templar threat in four large cities. The free running is slow and clunky compared to its successors. Even through the mess of problems, this game is a must play if you intend to play any of the other installments.			",158,15,0,15,3,1,5

												This is where everything with assassin's creed began. Is definielty my favorit one. Comparing to others assassin's creed you have less different stuff you can do but the place where it is played is well done. Especially masyaf, I was climbing to the highest point and looking around the mountains. It's stunning and wouldn't have move for awhile just enjoying the view but the game progress won't do itself.			",29,6,1,6,21,0,12

												Finally got around to play Assassin's Creed! Even though it's from 2008 the graphics still hold up quite well, however the side quests can make the game a little bit monotonous. I didn't really cared about them (I'm not a completionist) so I just played the main missions, with the narrative keeping me wanting to play the game so I guess it didn't suck that bad?Better to play in short periods of time (~1h-2h) so you don't get tired of it and give up.➡️️Final Rating: 7/10			",84,30,1,10,2,3,6

												This game is a 'mostly recommends' from me. There's an awful lot of tedium, even if there's some great stuff in there as well.First thing's first: The futuristic portions absolutely suck, they're tedious, boring, have no characterisation, and lend nothing to the story or gameplay. Desmond is the least interesting character Nolan North has probably ever played in this game at least.Second: The gameplay... sort of sucks? There are a lot of extremely frustrating elements that got ironed out of future games. Walking in a group requires constant button pressing to lock you in place, deviating from that cover at all will immediately make guards hostile in many parts of the game world. This can be incredibly frustrating in the more open areas where you'd rather move quickly. And in crowds where you have to stay hidden, combined with 'crazy' npcs that will shove you which registers as your cover being blown and the guards descending en-masse... well it is controller-chucking levels of maddening at times.Third: The camera sucks. This game has no cinematography beyond the occasional opportunity to switch fixed camera angles (which has to be done manually at specific times for some reason). This is a problem games have in general, interesting voice overs but nothing happening visually. It's very dull even if you like what your ears are hearing. Like watching a CCTV video of a conversation in the middle ages. I spent what felt like genuine hours of the game making Altair do pirouettes by tapping left and right rhythmically.Aaaand griping over.This game had a flow and purity later games lacked in my opinion. It also had a focus on the philosophical ramifications of its story as well that the sequels had no interest in whatsoever. While the future sections were tedious and entirely prefunctory the main meat of the story was very enjoyable. There was a strong focus on what exactly the Assassin's creed  meant, which was parallelled with Altair's character arc and his evolving relationship with a couple of key characters. The actual assasinations held thematic weight too, with the game exploring each of the target's sins eventually cumulating with a monologue from the villains as they lie dying in your arms (a mechanic future games have, but without the meaningful exposition being given by the characters) offering their side of the story and their justification for their actions, lending a final human touch to them.It also hinges a final plot twist on something that initially felt like it was going to be a ""Wait, didn't they just?"" Chekhov's Gun that I genuinely expected the writers to have been ignorant of including, so it was a pleasant surprise that yet another video game plot hole was actually an intentional twist.The soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is as solid as to be expected. It has a modern, electronic, style that later games wisely ditched (along with Altair's inexplicable American accent), but I confess to really liking it still. Particularly the pulse pounding track that plays after a successful assassination as you run from the authorities and attempt to regain anonymity, it gave every sequence a moment of ""OH CRAP, LEG IT!"".Also, as anyone who has played the later games already knows, the controller prompts for the PC version are absolutely bewildering at first with you constantly trying to work out which is the 'feet' button.Its a shame there's such strongly frustrating elements in this game as I feel like in some ways it is also the best Assassin's Creed, before the plot became empty hollywood blockbuster fluff and the gameplay became a sequence of distractions and ""stay exactly 30 feet behind this NPC without breaking line of sight for about 15 minutes"" missions.

												Assassin's Creed is a strange game. The game is built up around assassinations, as you might have guess, but the actual assassination sequences are rather dull, linear and poorly designed and not really worth doing at all. The rest of the gameplay however, the gameplay that's been put in there for no reason other than to claim it's an open world game, is specatular. Running around the cities, jumping from building to building, evading guards is one of the best open world experiences I have had since Prototype.Your are put into the shoes of Miles Desmond who, through the magical wonder of a machine called ""The Animus"" get to live the life of his ancestors, or in particular, this one ancestor who happens to be a 12th. century assassin during the crusades. I guess they got lucky when he didn't have to live through the life of that other ancestor that was a 15th. century bar wench.The story gets quite a bit complicated as the life of Miles and his ancestor gets intertwined in a web of conspiracies and ancient secret societies. You know, the usual stuff. It's not a case of bad writing but it does get a little contrived towards the end and the lack of any strong and memorable characters hurts it a lot.The fighting is mostly a case of parry and counter facing numerically superior enemies who are, fortunately for you, quite weak. Learning the tempo to this is quite easy however and you'll get bored quickly with the regular combat.The assassinations, performed mostly with the trademarked ""I cut my finger off for laughs"" hidden blade, are usually a scripted sequence and often involved a chase scene of some sort. It's not particularly interesting and the amount of fighting and running that needs to be done means you'll never really feel like an assassin.The open world is where the action is at, the movement is fluid and quick and the scenery is beautiful. Running around the city being chased by a slew of guards is open world at it's best and I'd recommend the game almost purely on that fact alone.When it all comes down to it, it's a game that fails at what it's trying to do and succeeds at what it's not. It's a strange combination but still a good open world play, even if what was originally intended as the core gameplay is somewhat disappointing.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												If you were now 2008Assassin's Creed gaming community was waiting impatiently. Demo shows promised, almost the best game of the year. If someone for some reason is not aware of something, Assassin's Creed is a damn beautiful action movie a-la stealth-in-the-crowd in the scenery of the Middle Ages, with elegant duels, spectacular murders and parkour (where is Ubisoft Montreal without it?). The current release showed the other side of the game. Which developers without any remorse of conscience concealed. But first things first.The first thing you experience when immersed in the brainchild of Ubi is delight. And wild. Next-gene graphics, stylish videos, a dynamic dueling battle system. And, being for the first time in one of the cities in general is ready to put the game 10 out of 10 and nalepit something in the spirit of ""beast game 2007"". The streets here look natural, townspeople everywhere, noise, din. An obnoxious beggar begs for a couple of coins, somewhere nearby, an escort of dissatisfied guards looms, a preacher talks about the path of salvation. Well, you just can not help but praise the French for the elaboration of cities. And yes, if at the words of the crowd you have the image of one of Hitman's missions: Blood Money (well, where the streets are full of bots with zero intelligence), I warn you right away - there are not any dumb people poking into each other and into the walls. Pushing a random passer-by, he will certainly send a tart note to Altair. Seeing the unusual actions of the hero, the people will not forget to comment on them. Having arranged a street fight, someone will raise a cry, someone will even get into a fight, and someone in general will quietly come on guard. The same beggar will throw a stone at you when you climb the walls.As for architecture, in this regard, a tremendous work has been done. On each building you can climb on the windowsills, bars and ledges. Escaping from the guards, we are free to gallop on the railing, balconies pillars, bars, carts, bags of which here in abundance. Interaction with the scenery for five plus.Let's continue. And so Altair gets the job to kill 9 people. Our goals are hidden in three, differing in stylistics (like the gamut and the palette of the environment, and the architecture of the buildings) - Acre, Jerusalem and Damascus. The gameplay looks like this: we rush to the assassins' office, listen to recommendations, climb the towers, that would be highly appreciated by the sources of information, and after finding out everything we watch the chic movie and kill the victim. Hmm, for a start, not bad. We come to another city and there ... Everything is new and first.Variety ends exactly after you leave the first city. Bureau-climbing the towers-mining information-killing the target-again bureau. And so on until the end of the game, strictly according to this formula. Monotony and monotony make their black work. Assassins Creed gets bored very quickly and already in the middle you catch yourself thinking - you do not want to play it trite. Lack of enthusiasm in the gameplay does not allow to enjoy good aspects of the project. For example, an intriguing, non-standard plot, which develops immediately on two stages - in our time and in the Middle Ages.Again, the combat system is almost perfect. Describe the battle on the blade can be in three words - effectively, quickly, easily. Laconic duels like here, in general, you need to make a standard, and then krimsanie each other blades (which we see in most games) looks already almost ridiculous. And of course you can not ignore the crown of Assassin's Creed - mixing with the crowd. It is implemented quite simply, but we have not seen anything like this before - it's a fact.TOTAL: In general, a sad picture emerges. Ubi sami also ruined their masterpiece, making the perfect almost everything ... and all this forgetting to tighten the rich, interesting gameplay.Rating: 8.5 / 10Author: Alot			",99,9,2,18,5,0,1

However, Brotherhood and on work fine on their own.-------------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION:-------------------------------------------------------------Overall the game deserves a re-mastery in my opinion, Altair needs more love (Even if he is an arrogant prick in the beginning).

												(I own this on a CD, and that was where I put in most of my play hours)Assassin's Creed has come very far as a franchise. Is the original game still worth playing? Yes. Absolutely. If you can get it to work.POSITIVES: The roots of everything that made the franchise famous are in the first Assassin's Creed. The parkouring and climbing work well, the cities are large and colorful with unique atmospheres, there are plenty of collectibles to while away the hours collecting. The story is pretty good. It doesn't climb the heights attained by Assassin's Creed II / Brotherhood / Revelations, but Altair's journey as an Assassin who has fallen from grace and needs to redeem himself is great, even if it's been told before in other mediums. Graphics are decent (DirectX 10). The game world actually feels larger than some of the other Assassin's Creed games, since you don't fast-travel from one city to another (not at first); you travel on dusty dirt roads through mountains and villages from one city to another. There is a lot of country to explore, and none of the areas feel re-used (though sometimes they can seem extraneous).NEGATIVES: The game crashes, sticks, and stutters from a variety of issues. My issues were solved by unplugging my internet while playing. The servers that Ubisoft used to authenticate this game are now offline, causing the game to briefly freeze any time I tried to load a save or the game tried to create an auto-save. Lack of an internet connection tells the game to not even bother checking, so gameplay becomes smooth. Even for a game this old, it's hard getting a constant 60fps. If you're running the DirectX 10 version, I recommend setting the Compatibility Mode to Windows Vista SP2.INDIFFERENT: Activities and ambient conversations recycle constantly. Stealth doesn't have much variety: hide, walk slowly, or mix with monks. Combat is actually boring – once you get the counter ability, countering everything results in a one-hit kill. If you're out exploring the Kingdom, enemy guards are extraordinarily suspicious unless Altair walks at the slowest speed possible. Takes away from the pace of the game. Oh, and don't fall into the water; Altair can't swim, and dies instantly.VERDICT: A pretty good Assassin's Creed game whose repetitive side-activities don't undermine a decent first attempt at a stealthy open-world-parkour-hack 'n slash hybrid. Hopefully, you can get it to work properly.			",308,121,22,53,56,2,74

It wasn't anything groundbreaking, due to its age I guess, but it was an enjoyable way to pass the time. The menu system annoyed me a bit though, too many steps to exit the game for example.6/10			",131,26,0,25,11,2,51

												The game mainly consists of assassinating 9 key figures throughout 3 districts of 3 cities. In order to assassinate them, you must first complete a few missions which boil down to collecting items, pickpocketing a person, or assassinating another person. There are 6 of these missions in each district along with around 10 missions where you save citizens from guards. You don't have to complete them all to move on in the story and there's no incentive to. You don't gain any kind of reward for doing anything beyond the bare minimum and even the activities that you do are extremely repetitive. The game looks and sounds like it should be fun, but it's basically just grinding the same things over and over with nothing to motivate you.			",347,80,6,54,34,5,55

												This game is so amazing. i couldnt help but think of Prince of Peria the entire time i played it, although the 2 are very similar. you may have heard the game is very repetitive, however, on PC, there is enough mission variety for you to feel you do things only once per region. the controls are very difficult as well as combat, but it seems to get easier throughout the game. Parkour combat and unique routes of going around assassinations were all great fun. Before, i played, i didn't think there would be much story beyond ""kill 9 dudes."" Boy, was i wrong, the story is great, even with some twists and turns. I love the ancient Middle East setting, although i havent played any other assassin's creed games yet. The prsent day story line is actually really good as well despite what i heard, especially after the main campaign is completed... Easily a 9/ 10 now one of my favorite games.			",160,6,0,10,4,0,4

												Oh man, there's so much to tell about this game that I'll probably spend hours writing this review.The game is pretty old already, so it won't you cost a lot of money. This is the first game of the Assassin's Creed series.Graphics:The graphics are pretty decent for the time the game was released. I played the game with everything set to highest. The landscape views (especially outside town) are a bit blurry (maybe on purpose).Sounds:Well I went back to Windows XP to play this game because the NPC's didn't have sound in Windows 7. But I can imagine that the developers did not expect people to play this game in Windows 7 because Windows 7 did not exist at the time of the release of the game.During exploration of the game the music changes depending on the activities that happen. You have combat music, sounds of slicing weapons, people screaming when they discover dead bodies.I also liked NPC's commenting on my failed attempts to climb buildings, falling and hurting myself and such.Gameplay:I'm very impressed with the gameplay. The game plays very smooth. It looks like they tackled all the bugs and it feels pretty natural to play. A controller is unfortunately not supported so I played with keyboard and mouse.The most challenging for me were the battles. Best way to do battle is to defend and wait for the right timing to attack. This is also what is taught in the tutorial.Sometimes the fights takes place in tight corners, which is more challenging than usual.I liked doing both the main and side quests. I really love how they took care of these quests.The game made me feel like a real Assassin.

												Oh man, there's so much to tell about this game that I'll probably spend hours writing this review.The game is pretty old already, so it won't you cost a lot of money. This is the first game of the Assassin's Creed series.Graphics:The graphics are pretty decent for the time the game was released. I played the game with everything set to highest. The landscape views (especially outside town) are a bit blurry (maybe on purpose).Sounds:Well I went back to Windows XP to play this game because the NPC's didn't have sound in Windows 7. But I can imagine that the developers did not expect people to play this game in Windows 7 because Windows 7 did not exist at the time of the release of the game.During exploration of the game the music changes depending on the activities that happen. You have combat music, sounds of slicing weapons, people screaming when they discover dead bodies.I also liked NPC's commenting on my failed attempts to climb buildings, falling and hurting myself and such.Gameplay:I'm very impressed with the gameplay. The game plays very smooth. It looks like they tackled all the bugs and it feels pretty natural to play. A controller is unfortunately not supported so I played with keyboard and mouse.The most challenging for me were the battles. Best way to do battle is to defend and wait for the right timing to attack. This is also what is taught in the tutorial.Sometimes the fights takes place in tight corners, which is more challenging than usual.I liked doing both the main and side quests. I really love how they took care of these quests.The game made me feel like a real Assassin. I could use stealth to accomplish a lot of my missions.Bugs:The game only crashed once during my entire game experience.Economy:I noticed a lot of beggers in the game asked for coins. I wouldn't mind giving them some coins if I had any. I did hear that the next game (Assassin's Creed II) would have coins.Savepoints:The game saves automatically after each mission.History:I think this game is a good approach to mix gaming and history. I never liked history in school, but while playing the game I discover and learn a lot about the past. Of course what has been written in the books is not always true, right?Improvements:I could not run in the Animus room, which was a bit frustrating.The fields between cities were a bit useless to me.

Well, now you can play that dream!  This is a game about running, climbing, jumping, being chased, hiding, and then finally you realize the truth - it's just way faster to stop and kill everyone chasing you than it is to run away in the first place.  I'm not exactly sure if this is what the creaters intended, but it's cathartic all the same.  All the same, this is a fun little game with a pretty-good plot (you won't really care about any of the characters, and the main character is only kinda interesting...his artificial arc definitely isn't going to leave you on the edge of your seat...so just get back to the stabbing).  As a ""stealth"" game, it comes a little short because it really isn't that except for the fact that you do kinda surprise people by suddenly stabbing them, then walking away (spoiler alert!).  (I mean, that would be surprising unless you live in like New York or Chicago or Detroit or LA where you kinda expect random people to do this.)  As a console port, the controlls are hillariously wonky to the point of comedy, when your character alternates being being a master acrobat to being the most clumsy creature in the world, seemingly at random.  The fighting is pretty much the same.  This game does have some silly camera tricks, though it (generally) sometimes avoids annoying angles, unless you are fighting.  It has automatic checkpoints, but the saving isn't really a big deal, and it tends to save every time you need it to.  This isn't a difficult game, at all, but I think it's supposed to be all about the ride.  It CTDs very rarely, but it's nothing to worry about.  Overall, it's a better than average ride, all things considered.  Oh, yeah, I got all the flags and templars, which takes like a million hours, and do you know you get exactly NOTHING for so doing.  Oh, yeah, ignore the flags and templars, unless you hate yourself :|			",293,25,1,54,23,0,48

												Alright...it's time I reviewed.Let me just right off the bat say that truly the only reason to buy any videogame is to help support the artist who struggled to make it (and, well, to get some entertainment in the form of a non-alcoholic beverage). And that's exactly what Assassin's Creed does...for like two hours.So here's my issue: it's way too freaking repetitive. You meet up with Al Mualim (hope I spelled that right), your boss, get berated, get a mission, complete one of many repetitive tasks (such as jumping off buildings and saving insanely helpless citizens) in order to even be able to DO the mission, then you do the mission and head back to Al Mualim to start the process all over again. Seriously. You do it so many times you easily accumulate over ten hours (even if you speed-rush).Yahweh, Allah, and God-- I'm just as unfocused and ADHD as the next guy-- so how the hell was this game so popular?!Well, I've come to a few conclusions which I will highlight as the positives of this game:1. It's historically accurate2. Graphics are great. Still hold up after more than a decade3. Has an interesting premise-- which is hard to get to because there are so many mundane and repetitive objectives that get in the way4. Very diverse. Represents many cultures5. Offers two sides of an argument that's been going on for thousands of years6. You get to be a mother-loving assassin (or at least I hope Altair loves his mother)It's for these reasons that I believe the Assassin's Creed franchise has prospered, and I hope to see improvements in the next game that I play, which will most likely be the second one...I just hope I can be bothered.

												/!\ WARNING - THIS IS MORE OF A ""MEH"" RATING RATHER THAN A FULL APPROVAL /!\ At the time, I found Assassin's Creed to be a somehow cool game. At first I felt immersed in the game's world, and I liked the parkour-type of gameplay.But the issue is that the game gets very repetitive, very fast: find a tower, climb it, explore the city, do some unvaried missions, kill your target, repeat.Overall, I found the game to be more boring than entertaining, and I'm not afraid to say I played it mostly for the story rather than the gameplay itself.Rating: 5.5/10 - A good idea with an interesting scenario, but not varied enough to be played again. The sequel is better in every way and form.			",875,246,32,90,58,8,101

												Assassin's Creed is a bit of a mixed bag. It's very well presented and entertaining, albeit repetitive and mundane at moments. My favorite aspects of the game are the story and general ambiance. The plot follows Desmond, a bartender who's kidnapped by a corporation due to his lineage to assassins. After he's forced into a simulation that recreates the past by using the user's DNA, the player assumes control of Altair, a Crusades-era Middle Eastern assassin. After failing to follow a tenet of his organization, he's ordered to assassinate a set of targets in order to redeem himself. As he investigates his targets, he and Desmond begin to unearth a series of conspiracies. It's an interesting, well-written, and believable story. While it isn't remarkable, it manages to entertain.In terms of atmosphere, the game has a simply sublime aesthetic due to it's blend of a Crusades-era Middle Ages and a modern-day subtle cyberpunk setting. The art direction is also great, and as a result it's visuals are arguably better than some later iterations in the series.However, gameplay-wise, it fails to live up. The story segments are enjoyable, however, in order to reach these segments, Altair has to investigate his targets. This consists of repeatedly racing across the map, beating up a target for information, and so forth. The game is also infamous for it's collectibles, which are arduous to collect and fail to provide a proper reward. Overall, Assassin's Creed is worth playing if one's interested in it. It's a game that was simply too ambitious for the time, and was rushed out in order to sell to the new console generation.			",245,52,5,24,7,3,30

												Just as good as the first time back in '08. Gameplay is repetitive with only 3 main cities (Damascus, Acre, Jerusalem) and your home base (Masyaf), but the story's what drives the experience.The gameplay itself can be (very) glitchy at moments, especially when free running; your weapon arsenal isn't as extensive as the other games, but it does the job wonderfully; there're no negative drawbacks to not being stealthy, so be as crazy as you want. These things don't detract from the enjoyment of the game, but can be frustrating when you have to escape after assassinating your target. This is a series in its infancy, we all know where it goes from here with the numerous added enhancements and features.Graphics-wise it's held up quite well; the environments still look gorgeous and the attention to detail for both the cities and history still fascinates me to this day. The audio, on the other hand, is alright for the main characters and targets, but is recycled for the NPC townsfolk and you can hear the compression in some of the dialog. This is a port, so it's understandable.Despite the minor glitches and audio complaints, I still highly recommend this game to veterans of the series and those who have never played the series before. Experience the ongoing, generational struggle of the Assassins against the Templars. Become one with the Brotherhood. Live the Creed.			",248,87,5,73,21,0,20

												A so-so start for the game's franchise. Pros:+ Graphics are really great and still hold up good even today+ Locations (Masyaf, Damascus, Acre, Jerusalem and Arsuf) seem realistic and nice+ Running and parkour-ing from rooftop to rooftop is very fun and cool (though it gets boring after a while)+ The combat system is quite good and can result in very stylish kills/assassinations if you master it (similar to Batman: Arkham Asylum's combat system, though not as good as the latter's)+ The story is good enough: the whole concept of the animus and reliving the memories of your ancestors stored in your DNA, plus the alternate history scenario are both nice (it reminds you a bit of an alternative matrix story too)Cons:- The biggest downside of the game is, in my opinion, its repetitiveness: in each and every city you go, you end up doing essentially the same things (pickpocket, assassinate, eardrop, save citizens, end up being discovered by the guards -> run and hide over and over again etc.), while only the boss fights are different each time and offer a nice challenge- The lunatics and beggars that hit you or stop you while you are running to escape can get really really (and I mean really really) annoying, especially since they multiply in the final levels of each city- The characters in the game are a bit dull and not easy to connect with, both the ancient and the modern ones, but only just a bit, generally they are okOverall this is a good game, you can feel it and I can recommend it, but its repetitiveness in each level is its biggest weakness in my opinion, it makes it feel boring after a few times, even though you get to do really cool things... if only the tasks were more different each time.Thankfully I read that the next installments (kind of) fixed that and made the progressing of the game more enjoyable and less repetitive, so I have that to keep me and eventually continue to the next game.

												Ok. So I was postponing playing this game for a looong time now (b'cause, you know - ubisoft. Plus I tend not to play highly hyped games right away, unless they are titled Mortal Kombat). And I have to say this game is lovely regardless few glitches here and there.Pros:- Action takes place in early middle ages (crusaders in middle east). Personally one of my favourite chapters in history.- Climate. Impressive, large cities. Architecture is amazing, brings up the spirit of the times. Music adds gracefully to this.- It's a climbing simulator.- It has ""find the flag"" mini-game.- It has story line! (don't get me wrong. If AC was only climbing simulator with find the flags mini-game it would be joy enough). Story is pretty interesting although not earth shaking. I like the feeling of ambiguity that Altair's last chats with his victims bring in.- You can try to play stealth if you wish.- Action oriented. Assassinations are pretty flashy and possible interactions with so many objects in the game can cause interesting twists. (I.e:  scored one templar kill by accident: was being chased, attracted attention of some templar I hadn't even noticed. He fell down the roof leaving me happy, although somewhat puzzled).- Antagonist and Protagonists: they are interesting in design. They don't feel cliche.- Open ending. Cons:- Weird one time glitches:  Damascus contact's face started to melt down while we were chatting. Altair froze mid jump from horse back, and memory had to be reloaded. - Sometimes game breaking bug may happen: dead body carefully put on the ground might twitch and fell of the roof, causing havoc on the streets. Dead bodies can even jump high to the sky, before they fall. Pretty creepy. - Repetitive:  people who might not enjoy flags finding as much as I do can find this game repetitive. In each city there are flags, and sub-quests (view points, rescue civilians, some informer missions) that are either the same or very similar (informer missions may slightly very).- Out of 3 major cities, Damascus and Jerusalem feel the same (except one has yellow and the other green filter on). Travelling to Acre I could feel that this conquered by crusaders city is different and had it's own western-like touch to it. - Fighting mechanics is simplified and a bit clumsy, especially when you face a lot of enemies. - You will not exit this game easy on PC...In general though: game is fun to play. And I think I do understand now, how this title is so popular. It's just joyful climbing simulator re-skinned packed with action moments. ;)			",128,23,1,19,2,0,6

												Assassin's Creed in one word; repetitive.     To begin, there was a fair bit I did enjoy about the game including: the parkour movement system, the story, and the ability to improve with the future games. The parkour movement system was what really made the gameplay enjoyable for me personally. It was new and fresh at the time, and was a grandfather to some of the newer generations of parkour movement systems in and out of the Assassin's Creed series. The story kept me hooked through out the series and is important for this game in particular and for future games. Even if you don't think you'd enjoy this game or don't want to play it, I would definitely recommend watching a play through or reading a summary of the plot for story purposes. Lastly, I liked how this game left room for improvement. This game did have a fair bit I personally didn't enjoy or thought that could be better, and with future games we see the improvements come and the games becoming more fine tuned.     With every game there are always pros and there are always cons. This game had a few key cons, the biggest of which I think were: the repetitiveness, lack of stealth, and hand to hand combat. This game is infamous for it's reptitive side missions, all in which are exact clones of one another with just the information changing through out the length of the game. This makes the game harder to play and stick with when you do the exact missions over and over and lose interest in them. Another thing I didn't like about this game is it's MAJOR lack of stealth. For a game titled; ""Assassin's Creed"" the first thing that comes to my mind is assassin, which then leads to stealth for me. This game however, has no easy or obvious stealth. There are some points in which you are required to be ""stealthy"" and shadow informants. There is also the fact that you can stealth assassinate the main targets, but that is never easy or as satisfying as it should be. For a game that screams it should be stealth, it really doesn't have a stealth aspect. I see this game more of a action game then a stealth game. The hand to hand combat is also a big let down for me as well. It wouldn't be if I didn't play a role as big as it does in this game. With some of the side missions you are required to ""Rough Up"" some informants for some information, in which you have to beat them down with your fists. With a game mechanic as big as this, you would think they would have it polished as best as possible. However, they left out one of the biggest things possible; counter attacks. With any weapon you use, when you're in battle you can counter attack, making it extremely useful. With hand to hand combat however, you can not. Making the combat a back and forth fight and also making it stale to play. Another notable thing I would mention when telling about this game to a friend is how the collectables in this game have no meaning. Especially in the steam addition as there are no achievements for them.     So, all in all. Would I ever recommend it to a friend? Yes. If you can look past the repetitive side missions, there is still fun to be had with this game and good story to gather from it as well. I would not recommend more then one play through or would not see people playing this game more then once back to back, but I do think people who want to get into this game should definitely check it out. Whether you want to get into this game or just find a game with a parkour movement system, this is a fun game that can give you a play through out of it. I do however warn that if you're looking for a stealth game, DO NOT buy this game. This game is far from that.			",53,9,0,16,4,0,12

												If you would like to know what the fuss is about this franchise you came to the right place - sure, the first episode is at least 6 years old but it still looks good and plays smoothly. Sure, it is not as ""refined"" as the rest - it has its shortcomings but many you can only realise once you played the sequels. It has its repetitive side missions, yes, the combat is a bit more difficult than in current gen games (even controlling the protagonist requires you to learn several ""stances""), yet, this was what started it all and to understand the rather complex and detailed story of the franchise you have to start with Altair's journey.If you do not like the first ride you can leave the rest. But if you grow to like the Assassins you are in for a very long journey, my friend!			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												From the Animus to the streets of Jerusalem, Assassin's Creed shines with graphics, storytelling and great action.  Climbing buildings has never looked easier than with Assassin's Creed.  My only gripe about this game is the repetition, eventually, all the action sequences seem repeated but in different places in the city.  Nonetheless, you owe it to yourself to try this game, just for the sheer fun of jumping from rooftop to rooftop.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												Assassin's Creed - The game that has almost as much S'ses in it as Mississippi has (say that out loud three times in a row and earn your way to become an anchorman on the news)Well, I played this game a long time ago on an not Steam-related platform, but since I bought the whole franchise lately I might as well give my two cents on this Indie-Game as well. Who made it? Ubiso... Well, nevermind.As far as my memory goes back and as strong as it is, I will tell you something about the Story first. You are playing as Ezio Auditore... later in another game... No, you are someone else in this game. You are the allmighty overpowered and underestimated Desmond Miles (who happens to be the main character but nobody gives a sh*t). Thanks to modern technology you are able to lay down and virtually slip into the Anime (or what ever that thing was called) to connect with the memories of your grand-grand-granddaddy's. Even so that in later Episodes of the game you have been given live to the next generation and still are genetically able to relive the life of your Grandparents story, you are pretty much unable to resist doing what the evil doctors tell you when they first put you in the Animu (or whatever) to become Altaïr, first of the Assassins in your Bloodline.Now, even so that Raymond is unable to fight back with an simple ""No"", Altaïr is able to climb the highest buildings around, take a snapshot from above, jump and fall a gazillion miles into an haystack precisely and is still able to get up after and kill a bad guy just before he takes an relaxing walk through the town on the rooftops. Shame on you Superman, you will never be that cool.As the Story goes on, you will find out that your major target as an assassin are the Knights of the Cross, which are all over the place. After their search for taking the land and in search for the wholy grail they slowly running into your blade with open arms. You for your turn as the player would wish for Coconuts instead of the endless horsetrips through the outbacks of mountains and deserts. It is not that it doesn't look good, it is more about the ""running in circles"" that is taking the fun out of it.Desmond gets out of the Anonymus from time to time and sniffs around, when it is possible, to become aware of the connections between the past and present lifes until ""Spoiler"" the game almost ends.As clever as it is and as good as it sells. All we want is to climb up the buildings and play death from above on every single enemy in town.7/10 Lonesome Cowboy			",470,303,5,62,51,4,63

												AC is the game that started it all, mixing some excellent open world action / parkour with an overarching story (and meta-story) that could easily be the screenplay for the next big sci-fi film.  It also nailed the basic open world action gameplay mechanic of combining primary objectives with optional side quests (batman), climbing towers to make nearby objectives appear on the map (farcry 3), and fluid hand to hand skirmishes that become more complex as the game progresses (batman).  AC nails these mechanics right out of the gate.The meat of the game is exploration of the game world, set in the middle east some time during the crusades. There are 3 cities to explore, each with similar architecture but a distinctive feel.  The player can only access a few sections of the city initially, and more become available as the story progresses.  Being an assassin, the primary missions involve dealing death to some high profile victim in a specific city and section.  Secondary objectives are a mix of ""protect the citizen"", ""assasinate these minor dudes"", pickpocketing, evesdropping, and parkouring challenges.  There are also flags scattered around that you can pick up but there was little incentive to do so.Story sections and major missions feature a brief cinematic that is rendered in the game world.  Often you can switch to another camera position by clicking a button on the joystick.  The cinematic then seamlessly returns control to the player.There is also an overarching ""meta story"" that is told from the perspective of a young man who is apparently a descendant of the assassin you are playing.  There is a device called the ""Animus"" that you lie opon... it then allows you to access and play out the memories from the past, and also influence (apparently) the original outcome.  I won't reveal anything else about that... you will need to discover that for yourself.All is not perfect though there are some annoyances:> The gameplay is repetitive, with only minor variance as your level increases.  The ""boss battles"" tend to become more complex but the meat and potatoes are samey.> The cities have some differences but honestly if you plopped me in one city and asked me to correctly identify it, it would be difficult.  They don't feel different enough, adding to the samey-ness.> The textures and character models are a bit crude.  I would definitely recommend the hi res texture mod, which you can find on the steam forums.> This game was designed with an XBOX controller in mind... you will NOT want to use a mouse.  Not necessarily a huge annoyance but I for one prefer mouse and keyboard over joystick.All in all I enjoyed the game immensely and would definitely recommend it.9/10 ",370,73,24,59,48,1,80

												Assassin' Creed, this is where your long journey through the entire series begins. You start off as an ordinary bartender who is kidnapped and utilized for his ancestors' heritage. Through this process you are placed in a machine properly named the 'Animus', through which your ancestors' memories are viewed. In this game you see through the eyes of master assassin Altair, and the trials his must face to regain his master rank within the brotherhood. You travel to three familiar locations we have all heard about in history class, Acre, Damascus, and Jerusalem. Here you fulfill tasks and assassinations to progress the story. Spend your time wisely because there are plenty of viewpoints, citizen saving, and challenge missions to complete in each location, as well as uneventful flags to find. By collecting flags, you unlock additional memories of Altair.Pros:- Combat is easy to master.- Parkour responds well to your path.- The landscapes are beautiful for an 2008 game engine.- The story is engaging to follow and fully voiced.- Weapon upgrades are easy to obtain, you just continue through the story to obtain the next piece.- Controls respond extremely well, recommend using a controller.- The game is short if you just focus on main tasks. I don't recommend, however, if you're just in it to learn the story you could spend maybe an entire weekend to complete the main story.Cons:- It is dated so some players may dislike the old graphics compared to games of today.- Side-quests are heavily repeated and bland.- Bugs, especially when anyone hits the floor the game tosses bodies all over the place. Sometimes even you go flying somewhere and glitch out. Though it is also hillarious!- The transition between Desmond and Altair can get sort of annoying, especially when you want to progress during the story's juicy parts.- Flag collection. Very tedious and not so rewarding.- Uplay. I only dislike this for achievement purposes, and having another game software running just to play this game.To wrap it up, these are my opinions of the game. I enjoyed Assassin's Creed and I am planning to play through all of them the rest of the summer. The stories appear to get way better and I for sure would like to play through them all. The start of the series is short, but it educates the player well enough to understand what is conspiring between Assassins and Templars.  I recommend this game to anyone willing to start at the beginning of this promising series. Plus, Altair is pretty cool and his assassin attire is one of my favorites.			",90,11,1,38,9,0,6

												After being 8 hours into my fourth play-through of Assassin’s Creed [1], I finally got bored of this game. This game is amazing and is worth multiple play throughs if anyone got the time for it ^,^ (I played it 4 times over, first time on Xbox-360, one with PS3 disc, once I lost that, bought it through PSN and then these screenshots from my PC version). I love this game and this franchise :D			",381,83,9,58,33,3,48

												I haven't had this much fun causing mischief since Thief 2.Assassin's Creed is, at its heart, a series of minigames. 1) Scale towers to get a look around; 2) eavesdrop; 3) fight city guards who are harrassing citizens; 4) interrogate know-it-alls; 5) pick pockets; and above all, 6) run like heck from city guards until you can ditch them in a cart full of hay, a rooftop gazebo, or blend in on a bench. But there is variety in these challenges, and all of this is stitched together with the most beautiful sandbox cities since GTA IV. You set your own pace in this gorgeous game.My complaints are few: no indoor environments in cities, too much late-game swordplay, and dreadfully long mandatory cutscenes.Lastly, AC offers fluid swordplay, and a parkour-like experience scrambling over rooftops. It's just fun to play, and the right length.  Thumbs up.			",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												Assassin's Creed is the beginning to a engrossing saga by Ubisoft. The story is first rate and the action sequences are seamless. The game has a third-person point of view and allows you to easily traverse terrain, climb buildings and initiate combat sequences from all-out action to stealth assassinations. The game itself is a wonderful breakaway from the all too common first-person shoots. Even though the game seems marketed towards consoles, Assassin's Creed does not forget PC players and offers a fairly steam-lined mode of control. By no means should Assassin's Creed be overlooked by gamers as its on-going story is critically acclaimed.			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												This game takes place in the same era as the Third Crusades as well as partally in modern day. You play as Desmond as you enter the Animus to relive your past as Altiar. There is so much to do in this game as well as so little. You can spend countless hours freeroaming and completing every objective to become an ""honorable assassin"", or you can go right through the campaign and have the thrill of assassinating your enemies over and over. The gameplay is fantastic as you not only just bullrush in and attack your enemies, but you also must escape and be stealthy like a true assassin. There are a few glitches in the gameplay as I kept running up the wall when I was trying to run up the ladder (or maybe that's just my own incompitance in inability to be a true assasin). The fact that you cannot swim was frustrating, especially in the last level. The fact that the guards targeted me as an assassin whenever I ran past them was a little frustrating as well. All in all, I give this game a 9/10			",202,37,6,26,19,0,18

Assassins Creed IThe amount of research and effort put into this game is stunning. Each city is constructed as it used to be in the 12th century, all 9 assassination targets where actuall people who either died or disappeared in that time.The game itself is very atmospheric with an interesting and deeper than expected storyline. Controlls may take you a while to get used to but feel natural after that. The main plus of the game is the free roaming and climbing, the transitions while climbing feel natural and flawless.Verdict -> 9.1 ",9,1,0,4,0,0,1

												First few hours it looks fine, but then it start to be extremly repetitive and boring, the controls are worst I have ever experienced. The AI will hit your nerves and mission only test your patience, means not fun at all. I wanted to get through the game just because of the story, but seems it is better to just watch custscenes on youtube.Im sorry to say that but this was very lazy work Ubisoft compare to Far Cry for example. Cannot recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I normally don't write reviews for such high profile titles since people generally know what they're getting into already, but I'm making an exception for this because it seems to split opinion so much, and after finally playing it, I can see why.Assassin's Creed is a 3rd-person, open-world, parkour-based sneak 'em up with Arkham style combat, Prince of Persia style traversal and Splinter Cell style stealth (try saying that 3 times real fast)... as well as having lots of collectibles, diving into bails of hay and punching poor people in the face. Yay! You play Desmond Miles, a man with two first names pretending to be a last name. Oh, and he's also a former assassin (apparently, it never really elaborates on that beyond the initial introduction) who's forced to explore the memories of his ancestor, Altair, during the crusades of the late 12th century. This is done through a device called the Animus which probes and records ""genetic memories"", the knowledge passed down through a person's entire lineage via their genes and allows them to live out those moments in their mind as if they were their own experiences... Yeah, just go along with it, coz that's more or less what the game asks you to do since that's as much as it bothers trying to explain it. Altair is a member of the Assassin Brotherhood, and after failing a mission and breaking the three main rules of the Brotherhood (don't kill in daylight, never get water on your target, and never feed them after midnight), is demoted and sent on a series of assassinations to restore his name and rank, but along the way discovers there is something much bigger at work connecting all his targets. Dun-dun-duuuuun! But this is where my first problem with the game crops up.The story just didn't grab me at all. It's incredibly ham-fisted in what it's trying to do, and rather than find it interesting or pushing me forward, it felt like it got in the way of the gameplay, and if anything, maybe even held it back. Had it been done without all the half-*ssed science fiction elements and instead remained tied to its time and setting it would have been a perfectly enjoyable story about the hidden histories that shaped the world and the shadowy organisations behind them. What we're given instead just feels too underdeveloped to truly care about in the end, much like the main characters, in fact. Desmond/Altair doesn't really have much range or depth, having about as much personality as a balloon with a serious face drawn on it, and at times comes dangerously close to being unlikable. And what's especially infuriating about them is how nosensical their choices seem or how nochalant they are about their situations, making it difficult for us to care about them. The voice acting is largely passable, but still very much of the old-school gaming mentality of sounding like a Saturday morning kid's show where half the characters sound like they're reading from a script and throwing subtly out the window rather than feeling like real people having real conversations. Any sense of naturalistic interaction is lost completely and only adds to the difficulty of being able to invest in the story or its figures, which is all the harder to bear given how much they focus on them being a thing you should care about. In fact, having come fresh off of finishing Portal 2 and hearing all the amazing voice work in that, it's made even more apparent just how mediocre it is here. But all that could be forgiven and forgotten, because what really matters is the gameplay, right? Well, actually... that's where the next problem comes.The structure is fairly straightforward. There's three main cities in the game connected by a large hub area, each city having three districts which are gradually unlocked one by one, and each district having a main target for you to eventually kill. You run around a district completing objectives which give you information on your target before having enough to finally do the deed itself. Objectives range from eavesdropping on conversations, interrogating enemy cohorts, saving citizens from vicious beatings, assassinating smaller targets, or several other tasks of little consequence. Unfortunately, though, that's pretty much the entire game right there. You'll go to one district, do all the objectives, complete the mission, then move on to the next one all excited to see what other fun and creative tasks you'll be given, only to find you have to repeat almost exactly the same events all over again. And that's the cycle the game repeats from start to finish. Once you've played the first district you've essentially played them all. There's nothing fundamentally wrong about the gameplay at its core, I just wish they'd given me something more to do over the 20+ hours I put into it. Sure, there's collectibles scattered everywhere in the form of flags... hundreds and hundreds of flags... but there's no real point to hunting them down. There's nothing awarded for finding them all, and beyond acting as intermediary save points they may as well not be there. Maybe if they had've unlocked files for real world information about the locations or the historical figures or the crusades themselves then they would have made for some compelling artifacts, but nah, nothing.Its main saving grace, though, are the View Points, buildings that can be climbed to uncover the map of the immediate area and locations of objectives. Monkeying your way up a structure then diving back down to street level can be fun sometimes, but largely it's the chance to take in the cities as a whole that impresses most, and they really are impressive. That's really the star of the game, in fact. The sheer scale of each city and the huge crowds that fill it along with the meticulous detail everywhere is clearly where a lot of work and love went here. The surface of almost every wall has something climbable if you look for it, and a vast array of beams and poles and scaffolding connects the buildings at every turn. I never tried it, but I wouldn't be surprised if you could make your way across the rooftops from one end of a city all the way to the other without your feet ever touching the ground of the streets and having to interact with all the filthy plebs below. I don't envy the people whose job it was to check that every structure was spaced correctly and that movement could be maintained as fluidly and enjoyably as it is. So I really have to take my hood off to them for that achievement.But while movement is a joy and tends to work just fine the majority of the time, combat is a whole other matter. The game really owes a lot to Prince of Persia, from the way it looks and feels, to even the majority of the animations which appear to be almost identical, but the mechanic I wish they'd abandoned from it is the combat. It was fine in small doses in PoP, but there's too much of it here that largely feels clunky and boring, with a fairly small weapon and move set, and little or no variety in enemy types beyond a palette swap or doing and taking more damage. Maybe if some enemies were in armour that gradually had to be stripped away, or some were on horseback or had other types of weapons that brought their own unique challenges it wouldn't have been so bad. Sure, there's always the option to run and hide, but even that can be tedious at times, given how often you'll have to engage with enemies.Overall, while it's not a bad game, with plenty of enjoyment to be had, it's just one that holds so much potential, yet, sadly falls short far too often. Had it been given another 6-12 months development time I'm sure it could have been a classic for the ages, but as it is, it's merely a good, enjoyable stop along the road to far better titles.

												The one that started it all and in my personal opinion the 2nd best AC game out there.Warning: Contains major spoilers for Assassin's CreedAlso here's my ""BUY RANKS""1: Buy this game now!2: Wait till it goes on sale3: Try the demo first or if they don't have one wait till it's half off.(All opinion wise)4: Wait till they make it free or 70-90% off.5: Don't buySTORY: You are Desmond Miles a 25 year old man captured by a company known as Abstergo as they have captured you and have forced you to do something extraodinary: to relieve the memories of your ancestor in order to find an ancient treasue. You relieve the memories of Altair an assassin from the year of 1191. The story in this is great and makes you feel like there are two stories instead of one, the story of Altair's fight and stuggle against the templars and Desmond's involvment with Abstergo. Has one of the best twists I've seen in a game since it came out. 9.5/10GRAPHICS: The graphics in this game are of course dated since this was made in 2007. Still though they're pretty to look at and the 60fps wins me over with it's smoothness and textures but still it's dated. 7.5/10GAMEPLAY: Wow what can I say about gameplay, of course comparing the stuff you can do in AC compared to the others there's not much to do you only have 4 weapons, your fists,knive and mini knives,sword, and the iconic hidden blade but you do receive upgrades in the game as you progress through the main story. There are sidequests and with the PC version I was able to grab 4 more, annoying but helped in the main game. You can collect flags but to me there really was no point into them. Then there was the parkor and the view points....holy♥♥♥♥♥♥their amazing. With the awesomeness of free-running and viewing the map piece by piece by the climbing on top of a tower and viewing it while an eagle is in the background just screams badass. Even though there's not much to do except do main and side missions you still have your own bit of fun. 8/10CONCLUSION: AC is a great game and again in my personal opinion is ranked 2nd best in my book due to it being the starting point to the series and NO FULL SYNC! Hope to make more of these soon and thanks for reading my first steam review.:)BUY RANK:1			",169,30,0,30,4,2,1

												i love this franchise so much that i want to give all of them 10/10 and call it done !But In All fairness i will review This game for u here :i finished this game more than 9 times on differrent platforms !Now there is a lot of thing going on in the franchise about story and the hidden secrets and everything ( WHICH i love and recommend u to see ), but i keep this review to GAMING and if u want the juicy details just search the web in general .ok let me tell you a few things first :NAME :it is that the name of the charachter altair, which is an arabic word that means : BIRD in general or a flying bird of not a specific type.FAMILY NAME : IBNE LA AHAD is also arabic meaning the son of no one . IT DOES NOT MEAN B*STARD ! it means son of no one, born from no one !i just want to point out that in assassins creed 1 or assassins creed bloodlines for PSP u dont see the family name !!!it was added either from assassins creed 2 or the brotherhood .in fact you see it in the begining of brotherhood but i dont remember AC2 right now !let me state this was a nice addition and was in sync with ac1 and was not one of the things that ruined the franchise or was not in sync, because many things were added in later assassins creed that are just not right ! this is not one of them.THE WORD ASSASSINS : is also arabic coming from the the world ASSASSIYOONS, which even in the game you hear on the people in masyaf tell altair : ""assassiyoons way "" or something alike that i dont recall, but he says ASSASSIYOONS !now assassiyoons come from the word HASSASSIYOONS which comes from the word HASHASHIYOONS which comes from the PERSIAN word ""HASHASHIN HA "" or "" HASHASSHIN S "" in english .NOW here is the important part : assassins or hashashin ha DID used to smoke HASHISH but the word HASHASHINS is not coming from HASHISH, in the old times around the 13th Century which was the era of the first assassins in PERSIA ! they used to call all drugs and medicines HASHASH, and at that time one of the incomes of the assassins where to sell medicine in general or HASHASH which later became whats known now as ASSASSINS !Check the pictures i uploaded on STEAM, if you combine what i wrote under the picture with the picture you get some funny juicy details.but you must have high knowledge to understand, for example why under Rafigh or Rafeek's Pic i wrote ALMUALIM when clearly hes not ALMUALIM !but then again it is almualim, then why would i write it there...??!?! Also almualim is arabic word meaning TEACHER !now i myself will PROMISE you that i will write a book about this franchise and i will be the one making tha last installment in its franchise . i can wrote 6 pages about what is LEAP OF FAITH !believe me there is a lot more to this game than the surface...---------------The Combat : is a lot better than the games that came after since it required more from the player than HEY JUST PRESS THIS BUTTON !-The Story : is ROCK SOLID ! i wont spoil it 10/10-The Character Altair is FANTASTIC ! it was THE BESTand ONLY RIGHT CHOICE EVER !- The GRAPHICS are EVEN BETTER THAN assassins creed REVELATIONS !!!- EVEN NOW U GET HIGH QUALITY ON PC ( even till 2020 or more its good... )-The way the developer, (SINGULAR 1 person) had the universe in his/her mind is marvelous . The controls and the gameplay and the hud is all designed at a deep level to make the universe come to life (UNLIKE SOME LATER ASSASSINS CREED GAMES !!! )The side missions are repetetiveThe travelings can be frustrating if you try to achive every in game collectible....As a game developer i promise you 1 day before i die, in the middle of world war 3, i give you the last assassins creed a 10/10 game with a gameplay taken back to its wonderfull roots and a story that sums up the entire franchise like no one will ever believe it !!!i give this game : 9.4/10reviewed by IMMORTALEADER			",400,45,32,38,18,2,60

												Games like this make me whis there was a neutral recommendation.The game is good, make no mistake. But it is sooo repetative, you do the same thing over and over and over again.However, I don't recommend skipping it. Bear with it and finish for the story.Then jump to the masterpiece that is Assassin's Creed 2.			",565,315,8,178,63,3,154

												Best assassin's creed game, awsome story, that is based on real events and real people in real scenerios (unlike its sequals, and YES the assassins where supposed to be based on the real world Hashasins look it up!). What i like best is how it doesnt go too far into the relms of fiction and thus the game universe feals scarely realistic. Furthormore for the game mechanics and the missions are the best the game and series has too offer, it provides you with the choice and methods of how you kill your enamy or how you aquire information for it in whatever order you please. Also you go into the game nowing nothing about how the combat works but after a few replays of assassinations i found myself using the hidden blade and never getting a scatch as i badassly counter all my opponents moves.For computing issues, there is none, you can play fine with little lag on even the oldest of machines, if you have a problem you can lower the building texures or turn off some of the non-nescersery parts of graphics, even still they look fine at the lowest level. But i suggest not changing the character textures as they end up looking heleroius and unreal on the lowest character textures, but that never effects lag anyway. But anyway you should have little problem. Finaly the cities are pristine and perfect, using real world buildings, such as the Umhyyad Mosque, Temple Mount and the Catsle of Acre. Also the cities up into segregated class quaters, containing many souks (bazzars or marketplaces) and dingy dark allyways. However you will unlock these different areas as you progress through the game.Overall a 10/10 game, a great show to how a game should be made, and i highly reccommend you plays this.

												I've started playing through all the ""old"" AC games again for nostalgic reasons I guess, and I can honestly say that you might as well skip this one unless it's on sale and you're a really big AC fan. A couple of issues with this game; The controls can feel very slow and clunky at times, especially when you're climbing towers (which you will be doing A LOT), the missions can get really repetitive pretty fast, walking through the streets and hearing people saying the same lines over and over again can get pretty annoying, same goes for the music when you get in a fight with a couple of guards, the vigilante missions where you help civilians feel like a chore and I got to the point where I just stopped giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them because there's absolutely no fun in doing them.I had to change and replace some of the game's files because the native controller support is worthless (AC2 has the same issue). It didn't take too long to fix it but it's something they could've easily patched in if they actually gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥ I also noticed at certain points the framerate seems to drop for no reason at all and there's nothing I could do about it. I liked the story and (most of) the actual main assassinations were pretty cool, but for 9,99 I would definitely skip this game. It was a great game for it's time but it hasn't aged as well as I had hoped. Again; if you're like me and you're trying to play through all the old AC games again, you might as well skip this one and start at AC2			",132,18,35,9,23,4,8

												Literally the best Assassins Creed game ever. The rest are just released every year to continue the ubisoft meme. Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad > Ezio. Altaïr is a BAMF fights 1v100 and wins, doesn't need two hidden blades and actually cut his finger for the blade unlike someone *cough* Ezio. TL;DR Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad is a god.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not as good as assassin´s creed II, brotherhood and revelations. But story of Ezio Auditore makes me to find out how great was Altair in battles against cruisaders. Compared to Ezio Auditore, Altair is forced to finish many repetetive missions. Unlike mentioned iterations of the Assassin's Creed franchise, the first game has a basic plot. Despite of mentioned negatives it is still fun to fight, climb and sneak around in the historical versions of Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus and in such an intuitively way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back when this game first came out I had bought it at full retail price on an Xbox 360 and I ended up hating it after seeing how bland it felt and how repetative it was. I ended up just giving it away to my cousin for his birthday after a few hours of playing.However many number of years later I just now bought it again for a $5 deal and I really fought to give it a second chance with a more mature mind and a better capable gaming platform. I am now a newly found Assasins Creed fan despite how horrible I viewed the game when it first game out and on console.Took me a bit of getting used to to understand the potential of the game once I fought through my first impressions and explored what it had to offer. Gameplay kind of seems like a unique style of ""travel"" instead of the old impression I had of it being a rock climbing simulation. Large sword battles and knife throwing action end up being really fun mixed with a pretty interesting story I now really like the game and finished it a few minutes ago.If you're like me, try giving it a second chance when a deal hits!

												Went backwards on this series as well... started out with ACII. Realized needed to step back a few hundred years and see what Altair was all about. Got hooked! Line... and... sinker...! The series offers more than a good RPG backdrop but a continuous storyline that stretches beyond a typical RPG. After completing this installment (had been playing ACII when stopped during memory sequence 4 to play 1st AC/Altair) I finished ACII. The rich storyline and a deep one at that, surrounding Ezio makes playing this RPG series compelling, entertaining, and challenging. You will be challenged on many levels while playing this series. AC will seem simple after playing ACII, but if you like reading a book series, puzzles, different skill challenges, and realistic game play, you will enjoy this series... on some level. Looking forward to more Assassin's Creed story line and gameplay.p.s. the music sound tracks are soundtracks are awesome and worth getting... ACII, ACIII, ACIV(Note: have not finished and/or played ACIII, ACIV but do have the soundtracks, the music in all three are worth the purchase)			",38,14,0,10,3,0,2

												This is one of my all-time favorite series. That's due more to Assassin's Creed 2 than this game, but if you're going to play it, you should start with this one. From the creators of Prince of Persia, the animations are top-notch.  Climbing, sword-fighting, and horse riding never gets old, and it has a great story as well.I played the first game on PC. AC2 had some issues with their online DRM, so I avoided that and played AC2 on my PS3. I found that I preferred to play this series in the living room, so I got Brotherhood and Revelations on PS3 as well.  But the game plays just fine on PC and I believe Ubisoft removed the online DRM, so that's no longer an issue.Sword fighting is graphic and bloody, and it only gets moreso later in the series, so probably not for the kiddies. The game contains some religious themes and tells a story that conflicts with the bible, so if that kind of stuff bothers you, you may want to stay away. Otherwise, it's an excellent conspiracy theory.			",152,42,3,18,4,3,31

												Assassin's Creed (aka AC1) was the first game of this franchise (obvious duh).In the game, a company named Abstergo, run by Templars, developed a machine that is capable is reading data they call ""genetic memory"" from people's DNA. With this data they are able to explore the memories of these people ancertors.They are using this machine to read the genetic memory from a man who is descedant of an old Assassin who fought against the Templars during the Crusades.Their main goal with it is to locate ancient artifacts known as Pieces of Eden, these are powerful relics from the ancient civilization that lived on earth before humans.This is mostly what happens on all AC games. Templars trying to locate Pieces of Eden to use their powers to control manknd while Assassins are trying to locate it first to prevent Templars from doing it.Now a few pros and cons from AC1:Pros:• Very interesting storyline;• Game is based on real life location and several real-life characters are present;• Relatively long with lots of stuff to do other than main story (mostly collect stuff);Cons:• Repetitive gameplay;• Lack of any kind of subtitles (it was an issue for me since I can read english, but I can't understand spoken english 100%);• Repetitive combat mechanics.Assassin's Creed started what become a great franchise, but this game is easly the worse of all of them (yes, worse than Unity), yet, it's worth playing it so you can understand how everything works in AC universe, also, you'll need this one to understand the very best of the Franchise, Assassin's Creed II.

												The game that launched the massive franchise. While many will say that this title is skippable for new players due to it's reptative gameplay I would say that you should consider picking it up to give you a basis for the world of Assassin's Creed and understanding the story of Altaïr.Keep in mind the game is quite a few years old now and that is something that impacts the gameplay (and amount of loading screens) but it is my personal opinion that it is a damn good game and a proper introduction to the franchise. If you plan to go all the way though the Assassin's Creed games (and you should since AC 2 and Botherhood are absolute gems) you should gather what lore you can because in the end you'll need it to make heads or tails of this game's universe.

												This game might well have been ahead of its time in 2008. The graphics and setting and atmosphere are like being in the old coutry in 1200 AD. Its an original and exhilerating experience to play this game. Yet lets face it it plays clunky, I am always fighting with the PC commands to get the game to play the way I want it to. The screen freezes which means starting from scratch at the buarough { if the spelling is unprecise I am sorry ) is an unavoidable fact.Aswell as other glitches.However this is compared to the games of today which really is rather unfair.After all it was made in 2008 thats seven years ago in an ever changing industry.Although too it gets a little ominous at times with the same old routine from start to finnish.But in all I have to give this game a thumbs up and at its price is still one heck of a deal. Even if you were to pay twice the price of it now  it would still pay for itself in good fun entertainment value again and again.There is one thing though is its very frustrating to play because of the mechanics of the game.

												Assassin's Creed is a great example of a development studio taking a risk and having it pay off. With it's pioneering of the puppet control system for third person ""platformers"" and the use of free-running (which later in 2009 spurred Mirror's Edge). Assassin's Creed has a basic flow. You get a mission in one of five regions, you arrive, you do all the pre-requisite ""open world"" missions to prepare (such as surveying the area from a perch and stealing valuable information that you can use to better approach the target), then you start the actual assassination.While others seemed to get annoyed with the preperation phase, I didn't mind it so much as it helped push the sense of how preparation was key for things like this, though some variety wouldn't have hurt.While Assassin's Creed requires a dual-core procesessor, it does perform quite well on anything that meets the minimum requirements. Unlike most console ports, the frames are smooth and the details are much better.			",655,134,32,120,86,3,104

												Классная, атмосферная игра. Одна из всей франшизы где хочется исследовать каждый уголок карты(такое чувство придет только в 3 части, которая делалась на скорую руку и видно что многое просто вырезано). Данная часть доработанна до конца и даже не смотря на то что в последующих частях переработают управление и сделают проще и удобнее, я еще долго после 1 части не мог отвыкнуть от предложенного набора клавиш или кнопок гейпада. Данная часть это начало увлекательной истории, к сожалению после 3 части франшиза не сможет поддержать далее тот уровень рассказа, который начали разработчики в этой части. Многие игроки еще долго не смогут принять другого протагониста в последующих частях, хотя наиболлее популярным считается герой 2 части Эцио, герой 1 части всегда будет первым. Ждем и надеемся что серия вернется к истокам и перестанет быть конвеером.			",110,4,1,3,0,0,0

												It is impossible for me to look at the first Assassins Creed with fresh eyes. The series is one of the biggest things in gaming for me and many others. It is one of those games that are very easy to pick apart critically but are entrancing anyway. The sense of history is unparalleled as is the general entertainment value.The first entry is more a sketch of things to come than a fully realized game. It is clear just how much thought went into the story and the lore, but the actual gameplay is still quite limited. The variety of tasks is narrow indeed, and repetition is unavoidable. Development process was apparently cut a bit short and Ubisoft was quite surprised by the success. This is also a rough console port, with a menu system very possibly designed by Satan himself.Altair is a hard man and hard to like as well. He is completely asexual (in this game at least) and more intellectual than emotional in temperament. Yet this uncompromising attitude has it's benefits and Altair does not wear out his welcome. His voice actor, however, is a completely flaccid line-reader. Peter Renaday (Duncan from Dragon Age) steals the show as Al-Mualim. The gifted Jesper Kyd began a tradition of truly outstanding soundtracks here. Desmond Miles, in turn, began a tradition of being incredibly unnecessary in every single way possible.I would recommend the series as a whole for anyone interested in sprawling action-adventure games. Stealth is but one small ingredient. There is little to no challenge in the Assassins Creed series but it is a world to disappear into, with it's own logic and laws. I would also recommend playing II followed by Brotherhood before this.			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												 The game suffers on lack of options like resolution or fullscreen mode. The game must be forced to go fullscreen and sometimes the Steam overlay doesn't work while playing this game. Also quitting is seriously too long. But ignoring that it's a pretty nice game. Short enough to not get bored, also completing every single DNA segment is also fun. Anyway I don't mind this game and I can't say if I recommend it to you or not. Give it a try if you want.			",142,21,5,7,13,3,19

												Классная, атмосферная игра. Одна из всей франшизы где хочется исследовать каждый уголок карты(такое чувство придет только в 3 части, которая делалась на скорую руку и видно что многое просто вырезано). Данная часть доработанна до конца и даже не смотря на то что в последующих частях переработают управление и сделают проще и удобнее, я еще долго после 1 части не мог отвыкнуть от предложенного набора клавиш или кнопок гейпада. Данная часть это начало увлекательной истории, к сожалению после 3 части франшиза не сможет поддержать далее тот уровень рассказа, который начали разработчики в этой части. Многие игроки еще долго не смогут принять другого протагониста в последующих частях, хотя наиболлее популярным считается герой 2 части Эцио, герой 1 части всегда будет первым. Ждем и надеемся что серия вернется к истокам и перестанет быть конвеером.			",110,4,1,3,0,0,0

												Here's what I think about th game :Good story (Like other assassin's creed games)Fine fighting mechanics (""Fine"" because I cannot counter enemies' attacks sometimes for whatever reason)Sure there's no ships to ride like assassin's creed 3, 4, rogue, syndicate and no shops to buy equipment but the cool thing is that you get equipments, upgrades, and abilities (such as dodge, break defense, counter attacks) as the story progresses on. Well, the only con I could think about is that you can't skip cutscenes but the cutcenes are kind of interesting to see. (probably for the people who loves history anyway)Well to the conclusion of playing this game for almost 14 hours now, the thing that I can conclude is that this game is good and it's worth it.

												A very difficult recommendation because the game is falling apart at it's seams on newer hardware, but it's still a recommendation none the less.  It's a very fun game, it has a decent story, Altiar seems very bland from his monotoned voice and you don't really see his face much under the hood, but he has extremely good dialogue and character development.  It hasn't aged well, it was extremely innovative for it's time, however, we've seen these innovations recycled ever since and done better making the game's world just feel extremely dated.  Also, while the futuristic parts of the game can be quite interesting, they're kinda shoehorned in the game worst than any other entry in the series, or at least before ACIV, especially with the ending.

												The way I see this game: Cons: ( I prefer to leave Pros last )You are one of the gamers that wants to complete this game 100%? If you are, it may get boring for you and I will explain why. As others have said before me you just have to climb specific towers or buildings to unlock an area of the map usually between 9-11 in every assassination. Then you have to interrogate a person, pickpocket another one, eavesdrop yet another, gother some flags in under 3 mins or kill some guards in 3-5 mins. You will be assigned with 9 assassinations in total which for me the whole proccess is as described by others REPETITIVE. BUTPros:I really liked the story, even though it was short it was intelligently written. The gameplay for me it wasn't boring because in every assassination you unlock new moves which keeps you wanting for more. You are able to kill any guard or citizen you want ( even though you instantly lose life when you kill a citizen ) and of course you have to face the consequences.Overall for me it's a great game worth playing and I recommend it to anyone that loves action games.

												It's Buggy, controls can be awkward when you first play, there are an excess of menus, and missions can be fustrating and annoying by how they are designed, yet inspite of all of this, the game managed to captivate my attenion and keep me coming back for more.It has an alluring atmosphere, intresting characters, and an alright story. The voices can be a bit bland, the ending is a little weak, and the Desmond scenes feel like an abrupt stop sign, but overall the story still works.This is my personal favorite of the Assassin's Creed Series. This is the original Assassin's Creed, and despite what some may think about more recent installments in the series, this game still delivers the experience that made the series so popular.There is a high resolution fan mod I would recommend with this, you can find it in the guide section for this game.

												7.5/10. (tl;dr at bottom)While that might not be exactly a breathtaking score, you will get 20-30 hours of gameplay out of this bad boy if you take your time and allow yourself to be immersed into the world, which I think makes it worth the price tag. When it first came out, everybody in the right mind knew that this was a good first step for Ubisoft's new IP. I owned the Platinum Edition of the game on Xbox 360 (which had fixed almost all the bugs and glitches) and I must say that it is easily one of my favorite single-player games of all time. Collected every flag, slayed every Templar, and unlocked every achievement. So to play it again on PC was nostalgic to say the least.-Pros-1. A rich and immersive story that has never been done before. That is, if you can look past the repetitive nature through which it is told (more on that later). You can see a lot of things being set-up, and with the help of the setting it takes place in, you might just find yourself doing what I did. Which was looking up stuff about the real life Hashashin and Templar Order, and researching the Crusades and places within the game, which they did a stunning job of recreating, especially for when the game came out. Their alternate take on history is crazy-cool, but the only way to truly do it justice is by playing it for yourself.2. Stealth works quite well, although it is significantly improved upon in later editions of the game. Blending in with the masses or groups of scholars fits and is quite seamless. As things progress the city guards are on higher alert, and you'll notice more of them on the streets, and also that there are more elite guards on the look out for the infidel. They provide a fair challenge until you get a grip of the combat (which is fairly basic), and that's good because Altair is supposed to be a total badass anyway, and a master swordsman. This allows for three primary different playstyles: stealth, open combat, or a mixture of those two.3. Another major thing to mention is the climbing works well. It is what gave that magical feel to this game when you play it for the first time. An open world where I can scale buildings and run through the streets of these beautifully crafted locales using parkour? Honestly made me want to go do it in real life. And some people did, just check YouTube! This is another mechanic that was trademark of the AC series, and only got better for the most part with each new installment. For its time though the system was awe inspiring, and fit the nature of the game perfectly, allowing you to truly bring out your inner assassin.-Cons-1. I won't spoil anything actually important, or something that would ruin the story. The story and lore is great. But the gameplay that tells it... repetitive. For me, a kid who played Mercenary: Playground of Destruction several times over, this wasn't much of a problem. It was easy to look past this and appreciate it from an artistic standpoint. Still, it must be mentioned, and if you ask anybody, this is probably one of the biggest gripes on Assassin's Creed I.2. While the Director's Cut and Platinum editions fixed a lot of stuff, the game can still be buggy as hell. I *DO NOT*... repeat, do not recommend this game if it is not compatible with your PC. Like me, you'll run into occasional crashes (the game has a great autosave system though), outright unobtainable and missing flags or Templars if you want to 100% the game like I did on the 360, and simply hilarious! glitches with guards dead bodies and even Altair. Annoyingly, sometimes when performing a Leap of Faith, he'll go through the entire animation and everything only to oddly bounce off the haybale at the bottom, sometimes resulting in your death. Nothing you can do about it, although it seems to only happen in specific places.3. The game is not keyboard friendly at all. In fact, the controls aren't even described in-game for mouse and keyboard, saying things like ""Press the Head button to use Eagle Vision"" but you'll be screwing around for minutes trying to figure it out. I recommend a controller. However, this also has issues setting it up. Majority of people, including myself, had to do a quick internet search, download a patch to get the game to recognize the Xbox 360 PC controller properly. Even still, keyboard and mouse with the Assassin's Creed games just feels awkward and wrong. I recommend a controller, and spend the ~10-15 minutes fixing it if needed + learning the controls of the game. At least if you learn them now, you'll basically know how to play the rest of the series.4. The graphics did not quite withstand the test of time, but you shouldn't go into this game expecting anything like that. They were awesome for 2007 as far as I'm concerned, and hopefully you can look past those kinds of vain things to appreciate what lies beneath the surface. They're not terrible or anything, but lacking by today's standards... although, again, don't know why you would bother with such unfair comparison.---tl;dr is if it is compatable with your PC, buy it. More than likely, your computer will be 'too good to play the game'. Of course, if you don't mind dealing with occasional glitches and bugs, most of which are humorous but might detract from the immersion, go for it anyway. Your call. The story is fantastic, and you should definitely pick it up if you want to play and understand the following installments. Worth the money with plenty of content and mild replayability, and a definite gem of 2007 despite its repetitious nature.			",74,8,0,8,2,1,9

It has a really amazing story and it is only the beginning. Buy it on sale. Don't skip this one in the series, because it's definitely worth a playthrough. It will lead you into a series you will come to enjoy and love, because in the next game will take you into Ezio's life and the masterpiece unravels from there.			",287,39,7,22,10,2,22

												I wanted to see where the franchise originated from. It has okay-ish gameplay that gets a bit too repetitive and tedious at times, because you basically do the same 5-6 missions over and over again. Fun to jump-shank people though, and combat can be somewhat fun if you experiment a little with different combinations, although not extraordinarily so. Recommended on a sale, if you've never tried it before, and want to start the franchise from the beginning.			",550,160,25,59,40,1,76

												I played this game the first time at 2008 but was so boring in the beginning that I gave it up and never tried again. Now in 2013 a give it another chance and bought in a sale. Had the same impression as at the first time, boring beginning, boring middle, boring ending. This game has a great history behind a horrible engine, very short options of side missions (and these are not cool to be done) and repetitive main quests, always with same way to be finished.Some more things in this game that sucks that are missing subtitles and achievements to unlock at pc version ( I like these things, make every game more fun for me). I only recommend to play this game to understand the start of Assassin's franchise, nothing more.			",317,63,13,28,29,4,52

												Game is divided in cities, each city has 3 zones, each zone has the same missions as the zone before. So yes, too repetitive. I mean, 20 hours of always doing the same thing; climb the towers to unlock missions (boring), save peasants by killing badmen, pickpoket, kill some, hit some and kill a boss for each zone. Too repetitive. The best part is the very end, which leaves a intriguing plot for the sequels. The out-of-animus gameplay is very, very, (let me stress that word once more) VERY boring.Difficulty comes in numbers. Though there are different leveled warriors, the battle-system is too simple. Always defend and when an opponent attacks, counterattack them, you'll always win. I've died few times, most of them because I fell to the water.  Apparently, Altair knows the killing but not the swimming. Nice assassin.So, if you have money on Steam sales and time to waste, buy it. But I still don't understand all the fame/hype the game has. I hope the sequels are better.			",84,12,1,4,1,0,0

Three Reviews for Three DemographicsFor the ApatheticFor the Obtuse& For the MeticulousFor the Apathetic; Assassin’s Creed is a massively annoying, yet intriguing, third person action/adventure game that is worth purchasing because simply, the good outweighs the bad. Its stunning environments, above average overall storyline, and cinematic bloody combat is worth the play through and experience even though there is a massive list of Irritating nuances to the supporting structures of the game, that no doubt most players will find regrettable. You may read further to see my own personal detailed review, but again, it’s fun to play despite the annoyances. For the Obtuse; Stab, Stab, Stab, Cool Knife, Pretty Girl, Computer Simulator, Stab, Stab, Past History, Old Doctor, Stab, Stab, Stab, Repetitive Side Quest, Climb a Tower, Climb a Tower, Climb a Tower, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Stab, Stab, Stab, Steal a Pen, Get a New Sword, Climb a Tower, Awesome Story Twist, Learn to Counter, Win.For the Meticulous; I went headfirst into this review thinking I would tear this game apart. The trending attitude right now is to bash on the Assassin’s Creed franchise because of the abysmal development of Unity. Ubisoft, the parent company, has also exhibited incredible stubbornness in not actually changing the game’s core mechanics and trying to venture forth into newer more lively territory, like most fans have wanted. They literally just keep chucking repetitive gameplay at us, like we are idiotic plebeians. We’ve essentially come at an impasse where releases for such a popular annual game series is being halted, delayed, and brought back to the drawing board because of these unfortunate dilemmas. This is why I decided to go back to the original game in the series, to play it all the way through. I wanted to open my eyes and see the entertainment value originally, as it truly was supposed to be, before throwing my personal opinions into the ocean of voices on the internet. My personal experience with the series has been playthroughs of both Assassins Creed 3 and 4. However, I never played the beginning game all the way from A to Zed, the one that started it all. I brashly thought and knew, that by the end of my journey through the mind of Desmond and Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, I would come to the conclusion that the eternal fight between Templar and Assassin was flawed from the beginning, I was mostly wrong… http://angryjellyfishs.livejournal.com/Go here if you want to read the full Meticulous review.

												The one that started it all. I've played through AC1 - Revelations on consoles and have decided to revisit AC1 - AC3 and eventually the rest on PC with 100% completion.There are two mind sets I would review this game in; 1. Completing purely for the story and background. 2. Completely the game 100% (All collectibles and missions etc..).If you're more of a number 1. then by all means purchase this game and enjoy the backstory to the others and if you're like me then play the rest. The only real downside the completing the game like this is sometimes the parkour movement will seem clunky especially late game. I won't spoil when I started getting frustrated with it. However if you're the wanting to full clear this game with all collectibles found and all missions completed then you may or may not want to skip this one depending on your patience. Problem 1. As I said the parkour in this game can be clunky if you're not going straight forward. As can be expected it's only the first in the series.Problem 2. The side missions are very repetitive. You will essentially have a cookie cutter copy of missions through each district in the game (a total of 9). The only thing changing will be the final assassination.Problem 3. Since I had decided to do a full completion run I found myself constantly Shift+Tabbing to a steam guide for all the locations. Now for some reason this game does not take that too kindly and if you remain in the Shift+Tab state for too long the game will simply crash. I have tried to numerous fixes I could find but not of them stopped the problem entirely. Thank fully AC1 auto saves after every collectible pick up so I never lost data. Just patience. If you are going to go for 100% completion make sure you have Vertical Sync ON for the ruins in the kingdom. As one of the jumps in which you will need to ledge grab for a flag is impossible without this setting! You will know it when you see it.Now for just general gameplay:Problem 4. Speaking of the final assassinations (don't worry no spoilers here). I found that most of them cannot be ""stealth"" killed. Now I don't entirely remember if the following games have improved on this to allow the player to stealth or styalise their final kills but in the first game it is essentially find the target, kill all the guards and then kill the target.TL;DRThis is a great game for the first in its series and I highly recommend it for pure story playthroughs. If you are willing to go through 25+ hours and occassional crashes + clunky parkour at times then it will also be great for a full completion (all collectibles / missions). Enjoy and Happy Assassinating! ",141,24,1,12,5,2,14

												I bought this for Xbox back when it first came out in 2007, it was brilliant fun and i couldn't put it down until i finished the game. Since then i have played through the entire franchise on console.Recently i decided to buy the franchise on Steam to play through them again, Assassins Creed is still just as much fun now as it was when it was first released.

												The game was released 7 years ago, and my interest has always been big, although other games always end up being purchased first. This year I finally bought tne entire AC Series, and of course, started by the first (even with all AC II fame).I regret to have taken so long to buy the game.Even on 2014, Assassin's Creed has a huge counter weight when compared to newer games, with more advanced technologies and more detailed graphics. With a unique artistic production and game system, you initially see yourself stuck to climb buildings all the time. Then you begin to sink into the story, and your bind with Altaïr only grows.You watch an assassin make his path to redemption and, along with him, begins to wonder about the course of history, and if what you are asked to do is really the right thing.The combat system is initially somewhat confusing. The complexity of it, however, is quickly outmaneuvered as you progress in the game, it even becomes a little boring and instinctive. Still, when confronted by multiple enemies, a wrong move can cost a lot. And if you need to flee, the adrenaline is guaranteed (specially with the amazing soundtrack).Definitely I'm not disappointed with any aspect of the game (a little with the combat system that gets a bit boring along the way). But the story makes it completely worth it. Ubisoft made a game worth every minute of playing.			",50,4,3,6,4,0,0

												A very good game, though not in my top list by any means. Had some great gameplay elements but was repetative enough to lose it's charm before the end. Combat was smooth and well executed, though I prefer a style that doesn't rely so much on timing and simply learning specific enemies' moves. The open world was very well executed and clambering around the cities never really got old, which says a lot for the game. The really repetative part though was the missions. There were only 3 or 4 mission styles that could each be executed in the same manner and I found myself losing track of which mission I was on simply because they were that similar.The other games in the series improved upon the failings of the first though, so if you want to play those, it would be worth playing the first just to get the storyline.

												I finally finished the game, overall I thought the game was really good. Good story line, awesome parkouring and assassinations. Great graphics for a game made in 2009, the setting of the Third Crusade is really interesting, must play if you're a fan of that kind of setting. I finished most of the challenges and climbed all the view points, except for getting all 500 flags.So if you're new to the game and is interested in it, beware, the gameplay is REALLY repetitive. You're pretty much doing the same thing for 70% of the game. The storyline makes up for it even though I didn't catch the dialogue sometimes, Ubisoft really should have included a subtitles option. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing if you're interested in the AC franchise, people may tell you to skip to the sequel but I like playing games in chronological order, especially in a franchise. I bought this game on a summer sale and it was worth every penny.			",31,1,0,0,1,0,0

												The original Assassin's Creed is a great game for it's time. It has a lot of excellent elements (jumping off tall buildings, climbing buildings, etc.) that made it feel fun. However, the game definitely shows its age. The graphics and game play (particularly some of the climbing controls) can be dated and/or frustrating at times. In addition, I noticed quite a few clipping and other strange bugs during taller climbs and some of the fights I had.But, as the original epsiode of an excellent series, it definitely is wroth one playthrough.

												Some good ideas and an all round decent game. The cities were designed very well and allowed great freedom when free-running. The mechanics of this worked well also. The story was a bit convoluted and got repetitive as it made you visit the same places and do similar tasks quite often, Repetition was probably my biggest complaint overall in the game. Combat is fun but can become boring and disinteresting. The graphics have held well and the game still looks and feels aesthetically pleasing. Had a few bugs but nothing major. Overall I would recommend this game if on sale. 6/10			",363,183,6,52,48,7,63

												This is a recommendation with a caveat.Assassin's creed gave the feeling of King's Quest, Prince of Persia, and Thief mixed in with an interesting storyline and compelling gameplay.The caveat is that the game has three parts that are essentially straight up repeats of the previous, just with more story progression. Each city is the same round of tasks after the first.That said, the story is decently written and gameplay fun enough that playing through the game is worthwhile.It's also a great start for the even better sequel.

												Assassin's Creed is a great game to play, no doubt about it. It also has amazing graphics for it's time and age which is a really great thing. In this review I'm going to be letting you know about the good and the bad for this game, (although it's generally good and I would highly reccomend).Something that I thought was great about this game is that it wasn't one of them horrible console to PC ports with horrible controls. It worked absolutely fine, and though I haven't, I'm sure it would also work great with a controller. Now, that aside, the general controls for the game were... let's say interesting. This is not because of it being a port, but part of the storyline. Basically you complete the levels in the Anamus and are reliving your ancestors memories. You have to be completely in sync with what they did, therefore as you are playing through their memories, the controls are a bit weird. For instance, you can't simply press the space bar to jump, you need to press 'W', the right mouse button and then the SPACE bar. There are many other examples aside from that too.The storyline for this game is absolutely amazing. You start of as a reckless assassin, ignoring the clear rules of the assassin code, therefore having your rank stripped of you. To regain your rank, the assassin leader, Al Mualim, requests for you to kill 9 'corrupt' leaders in different cities. Around the cities you learn more evidence about whatever plot or plan the leader's are planning, eventually you kill the leaders ect. The end of the game has a very dark twist, and I'm not going to tell you, because that would be spoilers but if you play the game with no knowledge of it, such as I did, it will be quite a shock. The game also has quite a good storyline outside of the Anamus, as you have been kidnapped by modern day Templars who are using your ancestors memories to locate the other Apple of Eden's scattered across the world.The gameplay for this game was generally good, but it could get quite clonky at times when trying to face more than 10 other enemies at a time especially if they are templars or highly suspicious guards. The game was also pretty repetitive as every time you entered a city you have to complete 3 investigations, such as earsdropping, stealing, interrigation and more. When finally facing the target things become less repetitive as each target has something different up their sleave leaving things to get more and more difficult.Overall I really enjoyed this game and would highly reccomend it. I would rate this game an 8/10.			",102,9,1,8,7,0,1

The story pulls you right in and makes you want to know what happens next.  The only caveat I have is the camara angles and control response is a little rough sometimes.

												Don't let the low playtime (as of this writing at least) fool you, I've spent a lot of time with this game on other platforms.The first Assassin's Creed game, while still a good game as the thumbs up can carry, is honestly inferior to the sequels in quite a few ways.The game itself is repetitive and frustrating at times, the campaign essentially consisting of three or four mini-quests in new locations you can complete all of or some of for the same reward before an assassination ni one of threecities. This is repeated many times with roughly the same conersation taking place at each turn and only slightly more exposition offered. This brings in pacing problems (admittedly present in most AC games) in that the story moves quickly at the beginning, slowly for around 10 or so hours of gameplay, and then moves into the endgame of Altair's story like a runaway train while Desmond's story builds up to reveals (and ultimately letdowns) in the future games.In summary:Fun mechanics in an open world that have been improved in future gamesInteresting story with some pacing problemUnfortunately repetitive campaign.Final verdict: Probably buy it on sale. <10$ or so, but it's a good game.

												Comparing this game to the other Assassin's Creed games would not be fair but I am still gonna do it.The game starts good but the first thing I notice is that the voice acting seems a bit off.After awhile I got used to it but it was a bit annoying at first.The dialogue in the game is clever and interesting.I was more entertained by the dialogue than the actual gameplay.I was getting bored hacking and slashing through dozens of enemies and I was motivated to do so only because I wanted to hear the next part of the storyline.The gameplay itself is decent even compared to the other AC's(even if the game is kinda old) but it gets boring fast.Each time you get a new target you do the same thing over and over again(9 times to be exact).My point is that they could have put more effort into diversification instead of doing the same exact thing for every new assassination.The sidequests are not fun and you will probably end up ignoring them after 2-3 hours of in-game play.Another thing that annoyed me was the lack of one-liners for the citiziens and guards.After some time you will start hearing the same exact thing from the citiziens and guards in all of the cities.I heard the following line : ''When he falls,I'm not gonna help him'' like 200 times and it really got on my nerves.In the end I would like to say that the game has a good storyline and some dialogue that is definitely worth listening to.

												Having finally played this, I have a love/minor hate relationship with this game. This is a good game, but it becomes borderline monotonous and repetetive. I loved the story and the settings the game takes place in, being able to ride horseback, the ""stealthy"" parts of the game. Practically everything. What I hated was, no ability to save your game (it autosaves and you can't skip cutscenes so if you exit and start back to a point you already where...you have to wait), it becomes a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at times. The storyline missions become very repetetive and are basically almost the same until you get to the intended target. Go into city, find person, kill person, etc... It gets very tedious if you try and finish the game in one go. Thankfully you get ""fast travel"" which cut down on the repetetive nature slightly. I got so bored at one point, I started pretending I was Batman and killing guards 'cause they kept bragging about their parents. The timed missions were annoying (some more than others, but I think you can ignore them for other quests to progress if you aren't 100%'ing the game) and one I felt was poorly designed (the timed one where you break the stalls which puts guards on you in seconds which takes precious seconds away, the time is too short, people scatter and you can't exactly grab people and bring them there without automatically throwing them). They couldn't add an exit button to the main screen, so you gotta go back into your profile and exit. My favorite, the main character has Aquagenic urticaria. You touch water and bam dead which was fun when he kept missing simple friggen jumps.  The repetetive-ness and the lack of a proper save option were my two main gripes but the rest of the game makes up for it. If anything don't expect to binge play this to the end. I kept playing in blocks, If I played straight through, I'd have been extremely bored. As always, your opinion may differ.Edited this (Jan 22 2014) to clarify some things better			",845,462,24,113,126,9,156

The story is great, though it's not worth to complete all the sidequests, since it gets very repetitive quickly, that, aswell, beeing a significant problem in the game as a whole.

												So I recently bought Black Flag off the Steam autumn sale, and it hit me. I haven't actually touched the Assassin's Creed series yet. I own 1-4 and Brotherhood/Revelations. It was always on my ""to do"" list and it kept getting pushed to the side. Well I finally got to playing the first one.If like me you've played any of the modern ""Prince of Persia"" games Ubisoft released a couple generations ago, then it won't take long for you to get into the gameplay. The game is built on the concept of parkour, scaling walls and running over the city rooftops and pieces of environment. It's basically a free running sandbox, with the goal of stealthily killing select targets in your missions.I have had people tell me that Assassin's Creed 1 has got nothing on 2, but I decided to play through 1 anyway, and for a first in the series? It's pretty solid. It did feel like it was missing a key element or two in it's formula, and that's what I assume 2 addresses. But for a new IP it's definitely a strong start.Only real complaint is that you never pull off an assassination as cool as the opening FMV. At least, I couldn't figure out how to do something like that anyway. The game is still quite enjoyable besides. If you plan to play the entire series, getting the first game on sale is worthwhile.

												The ancient and medieval settings and storylines of the world of Assassin's Creed have a really spellbinding effect that will likely keep you holding on for the next installment (of which there are many by now).  If ancient conspiracies (regardless of their validity) and the like peak your interest, then you'll certainly enjoy the bizarre storyline evident in this series.The free-running gameplay in pretty enjoyable, though it evolves and becomes better as the series runs along.  All the ancient cities are well designed for bounding across rooftops and clambering over walls while you avoid the city guard and Templars.I hadn't played a game with combat set up like this before I gave it a try, and it's a very rewarding feeling to get the timing just right to dodge, parry, and deliver a killing blow to any number of attackers.  Obviously the system of ""Everyone attack, just one at a time"" is realistically silly, but it makes the game simple enough that you aren't ever overburdened, as long as your timing is up to par, even when facing more than ten attackers.The missions are enjoyable at first, but they tend to get repetitive after a while, as there are only a handful of different types of mission.And oh god, the flags, they do nothing.  Don't waste your time, unless you're just a %100 kinda guy.			",92,20,1,9,8,0,2

												It took me a few tries before I actually played through Assassin’s Creed. (I think my fourth attempt, I actually stuck with it).It does not have the most intuitive control scheme, which makes it difficult to approach. However, if you stick with it, you can become familiar, and start moving around the world more fluidly. It may be frustrating at first, and require a conscious effort to put in the time to learn to play this game, but it is ultimately worth it.For gameplay, it is most satisfying if you can remove targets without causing a commotion. Learning how to do this can be difficult, but is very rewarding once you’ve mastered this art. Sometimes the boss fights just turn into large brawls, which is unfortunate. The final stretch seemed to involve very little stealth, and was just a bunch of large sword fights.The gameplay can become reparative, but the developers threw in side-quests to break things up.The over-arching story exists, but mostly you’ll be here for the moment-to-moment gameplay.

 Originally posted on May 24, 2009 Assassin's Creed is a fun game. In fact it's really fun. The rush of killing a target and fading into the crowd, or racing across the rooftops to safety is immensely satisfying... for the first 3 hours or so. Well I've played this game for about 20 hours and the last 10 have been some of the most frustrating times I've spent gaming in my entire life. Let me Explain.The game is absolutely stunning in the visual and aural sense. The cities feel incredibly alive and full of movement, bustle and conflict. The game's handling of light and shadow is incredible, especially for a game from last year. The animations on the player character and the NPC's are astounding. As far as making you feel like you're in the holy land during the crusades, this game is incredibly successful. It redefines ""atmospheric"". Yet after your first real assassination mission, when you start to realize that every single one after it is more or less exactly the same in the bulk of the gameplay, you quickly become less and less enthralled with the game.Every single district of every single city is the same for gameplay purposes. You gather information that has no real bearing on your mission, you save citizens, and you climb towers for incredible views. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Even the PC's extra missions cannot help vary the gameplay enough to stop this. It is some of the laziest gameplay design I've ever seen.Another major flaw of this game is that while it looks much better on the PC, the controls for both fighting and freerunning are incredibly consolized and clunky. They make the game feel like a lazy port. In that same vein if you fail missions there's no way to have saved your progress midway or fight your way out. If you screw up an archer assassination with one archer, you must start over from the beginning, which deprives you of a choice to keep fighting, and is incredibly annoying.And while the level design is mostly great, the ""Arsuf"" level is blatantly stacked and terribly designed, and reeks of lazy gameplay design.My final major bone to pick with the absolutely laughable story. To be fair, I have always mocked conspiracy theories, and their use in games has always irked me, but assassin's creed takes the prize. The fact that I assassinated a few key individuals means that the crusades will suddenly end, Richard and Saladin will come together at the ""evil"" Templar's bidding and destroy a small cult of Assassin's? Ridiculous. And of course the whole animus technology is funny as hell. Genetic memory??? HA!Anyways, that's not to say the story isn't well written, it's just that at times the suspension of disbelief isn't there.Overall, the game is gorgeous, immersive, and atmospheric, but it is also badly designed, relies on silly story crutches, and is heavily consolized.

												Assassin's Creed is one of the most unique story-action-RPG game ever made. Smooth combat and facial animation put even recent RPG games to shame. The middle east during the times of the crusaders is believable and feels very authentic. This game is executed to a very high level and is definitely worth the full price even after so many years.Assassin's Creed on the PC is however not without its faults. Make no mistakes, this was made-for-console. Any PC gamers will immediately find the PC controls clunky. There are many console-nastiness such as checkpoint saving and ridiculous combat controls which plainly does not work on a mouse and keyboard. I gave up trying to remember all the different keys for all the combat moves and used only block/retaliate which requires only right and left mouse buttons.The gameplay can also get quite repetitive and it's a chore to do the tasks because 90% of the time you are wading through people and trying to blend in. Run a bit and you get caught. Bump into someone, you get caught. It's fun the first few times, but gets really annoying after a few hours. Sometimes people just wanna play and walking slowly doing nothing is not playing. Replayability is poor because after 20 hrs, i just wanna get it over with.All the funky console issues aside, I would definitely still recommend all RPG fans to get this game. If you haven't played Assassin's Creed, you are missing out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am personally loving this game. I've played it for 30+ hours, and it is really fun. Assassinations are really tricky though, so don't be surprised if most of your attempts end in you fighting all the guards one by one until you kill your target, instead of a nice slick knife in the back.The cities are amazing in their scope and detail. However, the fact that they're so large means you spend a lot of time in the game just getting from place to place.All in all, I very much recommend it. Oh, and one last note: killing people with counter moves looks awesome.			",182,26,3,7,12,3,32

												Game is divided in cities, each city has 3 zones, each zone has the same missions as the zone before. So yes, too repetitive. I mean, 20 hours of always doing the same thing; climb the towers to unlock missions (boring), save peasants by killing badmen, pickpoket, kill some, hit some and kill a boss for each zone. Too repetitive. The best part is the very end, which leaves a intriguing plot for the sequels. The out-of-animus gameplay is very, very, (let me stress that word once more) VERY boring.Difficulty comes in numbers. Though there are different leveled warriors, the battle-system is too simple. Always defend and when an opponent attacks, counterattack them, you'll always win. I've died few times, most of them because I fell to the water.  Apparently, Altair knows the killing but not the swimming. Nice assassin.So, if you have money on Steam sales and time to waste, buy it. But I still don't understand all the fame/hype the game has. I hope the sequels are better.			",84,12,1,4,1,0,0

												My favorite of the series.... :-)No, the gameplay isn't the greatest.  It's very repetitive in its mission format, combat, and even aesthetics.  AC2 greatly improved upon those aspects, absolutely.What the original Assassin's Creed has is a story, a journey for Altair and Desmond Miles.  Both are paths of discovery and debate, a testing of iron against philosophical iron.  As Altair questions the precepts of the Assassin's Order and Templars, Desmond learns more of how the conflict in the Crusades applies to him in the modern age.  The plot is beautifully and intelligently (for prose fiction) presented to the player in a way that reveals tidbits consistently, yet subtly.It's a shame none of its sequels have ever matched the caliber of moral discourse in this title.  However, for the presentation of the plot alone, with its twists and back-and-forths, along with a cliffhanger of epic proportions, Assassin's Creed is a game worth experiencing.

												The one that started the illustrious series from Ubi Montreal. There is a lot of good, but a decent amount of mundane to be found here. While the moment to moment gameplay is fun, free-running section can be spoiled by how the game registers the ledge you are aiming for. The graphics do the job at hand and still hold up in 2016. For the searchers there is a decent number of collectables to find. On the other hand, those wishing for well-paced story telling must look for a different game, as meaningful story bits are few and far between.Pros:+ parkour+ assassin’s arsenal+ city verticalityCons:- story pacing- the difficulty is modified by the number of enemies later onWho is this game for?Those wishing for a good price/time ratio in their games and lovers of parkour.

												The one that started it all. I've played through AC1 - Revelations on consoles and have decided to revisit AC1 - AC3 and eventually the rest on PC with 100% completion.There are two mind sets I would review this game in; 1. Completing purely for the story and background. 2. Completely the game 100% (All collectibles and missions etc..).If you're more of a number 1. then by all means purchase this game and enjoy the backstory to the others and if you're like me then play the rest. The only real downside the completing the game like this is sometimes the parkour movement will seem clunky especially late game. I won't spoil when I started getting frustrated with it. However if you're the wanting to full clear this game with all collectibles found and all missions completed then you may or may not want to skip this one depending on your patience. Problem 1. As I said the parkour in this game can be clunky if you're not going straight forward. As can be expected it's only the first in the series.Problem 2. The side missions are very repetitive. You will essentially have a cookie cutter copy of missions through each district in the game (a total of 9). The only thing changing will be the final assassination.Problem 3. Since I had decided to do a full completion run I found myself constantly Shift+Tabbing to a steam guide for all the locations. Now for some reason this game does not take that too kindly and if you remain in the Shift+Tab state for too long the game will simply crash. I have tried to numerous fixes I could find but not of them stopped the problem entirely. Thank fully AC1 auto saves after every collectible pick up so I never lost data. Just patience. If you are going to go for 100% completion make sure you have Vertical Sync ON for the ruins in the kingdom. As one of the jumps in which you will need to ledge grab for a flag is impossible without this setting! You will know it when you see it.Now for just general gameplay:Problem 4. Speaking of the final assassinations (don't worry no spoilers here). I found that most of them cannot be ""stealth"" killed. Now I don't entirely remember if the following games have improved on this to allow the player to stealth or styalise their final kills but in the first game it is essentially find the target, kill all the guards and then kill the target.TL;DRThis is a great game for the first in its series and I highly recommend it for pure story playthroughs. If you are willing to go through 25+ hours and occassional crashes + clunky parkour at times then it will also be great for a full completion (all collectibles / missions). Enjoy and Happy Assassinating! ",141,24,1,12,5,2,14

												Many gamers like to loathe the first Assassin's Creed game for a very specific reason: it's a repetitive title. The entirety of the gameplay consists in riding an horse near patrols of guards with a strict max velocity policy on very large distances, reaching a city, performing some side-quests which remain exactly identical till the end, gameplay-wise, and then, at last, performing your assassination. And off you go again.I'd say too it's something that can drive you away from the title. However, Assassin's Creed got two features that I was never able to find in the following sequels:1)The game really made me feel like an assassin, having to reach the target's town and gathering information before planning my move. Also, unlike Assassin's Creed II onwards, in the first title you are far from a killing machine: leave the scene and hide is always the best solution, here. Also, no economic or risiko mechanics: very interesting, I won't deny it, but not very fitting to a group of shadows which main purpose is to stealthy eliminate menaces to humanity2) Assassin's Creed spots very interesting villains in the Templars, who are mostly portraied as anti-villains and well intentioned extremists. Their final speeches are the main highlight of the game's plot, in my opinionSuffice to say, I really think Assassin's Creed the first is the only worthy game of the series this far, with Assassin's Creed III coming very close to give me the same feelings			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												I just finished my second play-through of this game, my first being shortly after it came out. I stand by my opinion that this is a great game that is well worth playing.First, the game's flaw (and there is only one major flaw): the missions are unashamedly repetitive. If don't mind that, or mitigate it by performing only one or two assassinations per evening, then the game should be very enjoyable. If this is likely to be a huge issue for you, perhaps skip ahead to ACII instead, which has (almost) all the great elements of this game but with much more varied missions. AC has no game-breaking bugs for me, but minor bugs include bodies occasionally flipping through the air.Now for the reasons to play:  The plot: interesting, with multiple twists. The storytelling: primarily done through well-written cut-scenes. The soundtrack: a real pleasure to hear - I'm sitting here listening to it as I write this review. The combat: it has more depth than it might initially seem. Of course, you can just wait for them to attack and counter all the time, but it's far from the fastest or most effective way of fighting. Additionally, getting in the habit of dodging or disrupting the powerful spin attacks (they cannot be countered) is helpful for the later part of the game). The stealth system: well-executed.The voice acting varies in quality, but it is generally high (with the notable exception of Altair, unfortunately).Some people dislike the way you can fall of ledges when jumping to them: while this can be an issue in the early part of the game, once you relearn how to grab onto ledges it becomes simply an additional skill the game requires, making free running a little more challenging if you want to avoid falling to the ground.Overall, I strongly recommend this game as highly enjoyable stealth action game with a great story.

												Where it all began...The more recent Assassin's Creed titles may have better gameplay and graphics, but they lack storyline and completely disregard the original concept of the Assassins and their creed: to be discrete in all things. How can you expect to be discreet when weilding tens of weapons (including guns & explosives), having access to armies of assassins, and sailing pirate ships into combat... Almost feels like you're playing ""God of War"".The first episode of the series may be more difficult and less grandiose compared to the recent titles, and the gameplay may have aged a bit. But the storyline, dialogue and general ambiance definitely make up for it. Still my favorite Assassin's Creed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also the game includes a very good illustration of how Jerusalem looked like.On some interviews developers stated that they tried their best to create the maps to look exactly like how it was back then.No special effects of explotions or casting magic,its more the realistic kind of gaming. Music: fine,although they could have done something more epic than they did.Gameplay: simple fight system,gets boring after realizing you are repeating yourself over and over and over again.However there is a super awesome feature,building-climbing and freerunning.This will keep up your interest and help you enjoy yourself through the game for sure!

												Assassin's Creed is possibly one of the greatest games released in 2007. It's a sandbox nature game with remarkable visuals, sound effects and story, which is based on historical events and people. There are two overlaping stories in this game: Desmond Miles and Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, through machine called Animus. Within the Animus, Altaïr's memories reveal that he was attempting to stop Robert de Sablé from taking an artifact from a Solomons temple, but broke all three of the assassin brotherhood's tenets in the process. The brotherhood leader, Al Mualim, demotes Altaïr to the rank of novice, and assigns him the task of assassinating nine people, all of whom are Templars, to regain his former status. As Altaïr assassinate them one by one he realises something is wrong about this assignment and that these people somehow are connected. Overall pretty good story, The gameplay consist out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim. To achieve this goal, you must travel from the Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional ""recon"" missions before attempting the assassination. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets.Overall it‘s pretty good game, worth your attention but it does have downsides. The bad: It‘s repetitive and does not provide much graphic options for high end pc, combat is clunky and sometimes feels awkward. The Good: Fun parkour mechanics, great story, huge sandbox world that feels alive, great soundtrack, many little details. 7/10			",61,11,0,4,2,0,2

												The start of the now long-running Assassin's Creed franchise, you are placed in the shoes of Altaiir, an assassin during the Crusades. This game possesses a very historically-centric plot and the parkour gameplay foundation that the franchise, and many others, now use.First off, the gameplay has aged somewhat badly, particularly if you've played any other parkour movement games released since. The movement in this game is noticeably slower than its sequels, especially when climbing up the sides of towers and buildings. The combat, however, is both better and worse than that in the sequels. It is much simpler, not allowing nearly as many options in combat and can be very slow when fighting multiple opponents. On the plus side, it is more difficult than the newer Assassin's Creed games, actually providing somewhat of a challenge in combat.Now, the real highlight of this game is the plot. While it may be told in a very weak way, with you doing the same things over and over in different locations and being rewarded with a monologue, it is a very thematically/morally strong plot. It addresses the nature of good and bad on a very deep level and if you enjoy philosophy or analyzing morality, you will love it. It's truly a shame that they dropped this plot strength in the later iterations of the game.Overall, I'd recommend the game, as I feel it is still great fun, and the message is simply unforgettable.

												So here it is. The first, the one that started it all...and it's ongoing yearly (Or so) sequels and add ons. Short at sweet....for me one of the most overrated games EVER!....BUT, I will say that its actually quite fun and has a damn lot of atmosphere. It's the Batman Arkham assylum before there was one. Unfortunately, there's this huge open world which goes to waste, for the most part you go looking for flags and stuff....to what ends? Just to collect things with no reward?This is why the sequels did so much better. Regardless, the story  is great, graphics are rather nice, even for an 8 year old game and sets the stage for the sequel, which in my opinion was a much better use of open world. I'll still recommend this though.			",215,40,1,35,13,0,27

												Assassins Creed is one of the most well know Action/Adventure series to date, and rightfully so! I have always been a big fan of Assassin Creed, and owned all the collectors editions on my Xbox, but as I transitions to PC, I really missed Assassins Creed. AC really kickstarted my gaming hobby, and now that it has finally been released to PC, I am more than happy to say it made a smooth transition, with slightly better graphics than on consoles! Director's Cut is not much different than the original game, but is still a respectable port to the PC. I cannot say much about the graphics as they are very outdated by todays standards, but keeping in mind this assassins creed is over 6 years old! Gameplay feels fast paced, challenging, and smooth! Story is pretty basic, and the entire game is basically repeating the same 3 primary missions, over and over again. The whole climb everywhere feature is amazing, and still beats most games to date! I love that we finally got a PC version of Assassins Creed, because it's an outstanding series!Concept: Honestly very basic, the storyline is very repetitive, following one basic task to the next. 75/100Graphics: For its time, it's outstanding, everything has a suprising ammount of detail, and is very respectable. 90/100Sound: Sounds effects are great, but the overall soundtrack is very boring, and feels like it was left to the last second while in development. 75/100Playability: Using a keyboard and mouse feels great and was very well implimented! Combat is smooth and entertaining, and climbing up buildings feels great! 95/100Entertainment: Concept is basic, storyline is basic, campaigne is bare-bones, but the amazing gameplay and graphics really boost Assassins Creed: Director's Cut. 75/100Replay Value: Moderatly low.Overall Score: 82/100			",174,20,2,4,6,0,4

												Having finally played this, I have a love/minor hate relationship with this game. This is a good game, but it becomes borderline monotonous and repetetive. I loved the story and the settings the game takes place in, being able to ride horseback, the ""stealthy"" parts of the game. Practically everything. What I hated was, no ability to save your game (it autosaves and you can't skip cutscenes so if you exit and start back to a point you already where...you have to wait), it becomes a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at times. The storyline missions become very repetetive and are basically almost the same until you get to the intended target. Go into city, find person, kill person, etc... It gets very tedious if you try and finish the game in one go. Thankfully you get ""fast travel"" which cut down on the repetetive nature slightly. I got so bored at one point, I started pretending I was Batman and killing guards 'cause they kept bragging about their parents. The timed missions were annoying (some more than others, but I think you can ignore them for other quests to progress if you aren't 100%'ing the game) and one I felt was poorly designed (the timed one where you break the stalls which puts guards on you in seconds which takes precious seconds away, the time is too short, people scatter and you can't exactly grab people and bring them there without automatically throwing them). They couldn't add an exit button to the main screen, so you gotta go back into your profile and exit. My favorite, the main character has Aquagenic urticaria. You touch water and bam dead which was fun when he kept missing simple friggen jumps.  The repetetive-ness and the lack of a proper save option were my two main gripes but the rest of the game makes up for it. If anything don't expect to binge play this to the end. I kept playing in blocks, If I played straight through, I'd have been extremely bored. As always, your opinion may differ.Edited this (Jan 22 2014) to clarify some things better			",845,462,24,113,126,9,156

												Algo para empezar a comentar acerca de la primera entrega de esta saga de asesinos es que a pesar de que no sea un juego que me guste mucho, la historia es interesante con un broche de buen finalJugabilidad-(8): Mas viniendo de Ubisoft, no es una innovacion esto del parkour ya que en una de sus anteriores sagas, donde si que fue una jugabilidad totalmente novedosa, se aplico.No son movimiento muy pulidos aun ya que al saltar o intentar acrobacias puedes no acertar a agarrarte a algun sitio y poder caer y bueno al igual que el sistema de lucha que se hace algo repetitivo al ver que las muertes son casi siempre iguales, a pesar de ello no esta mal del todo, son unos movimientos caracteristicos que le da algo de vida a este juego.Graficos-(8,9): No esta mal graficamente esta obra, pero si que se puede apreciar el personaje el cual manejamos esta bastante cuidado graficamente mientras el resto no lo estan tanto, al igual que algunos objetos o el trasfondo de escenario no jugable que vemos al subir a las torres para sincronizar, pero en general es una buena cosa que tiene este juegoSonido-(8): Este juego no es muy destacale en el apartado de sonido, no tiene una banda sonora de la que uno pueda quedar impresionado, bien es cierto que en ese apartado se podrian haber hecho las cosas muchos mejores, aunque no deja de tener encanto pasar por las calles del pueblo y encontrar pregoneros y gente recitando un discurso que es un bonito detalle de epoca.Innovacion-(7,8): Si, el titulo en si es innovador, pero a la vez no, la idea como juego basado en hechos historicos hecho y planteado de esta manera no se ha visto en ningun otro titulo pero digamos que no deja de tener un poco de otro juegos anteriores, lo cual no quiere decir nada malo, hay sagas que le pasan lo mismo y son estupendas, pero no puede ser todo lo innovador de lo que decianEn resumen, en mi experiencia, no es un juego de mis favoritos la verdad, y no creo que lo vuelva a jugar dado a que la mayoria del juego se me hace pesado y repetitivo, siempre el mismo procedimiento a la hora de asesinar y asi hasta unas 9 veces, auque es cierto que en el final tiene un poco de cambio, que para mi gusto, es una de las mejores partes del juegoPuntos fuertes:+Representa muy bien la epoca de la edad media junto con tematicas como la de los temmplarios+Graficamente esta bien diseñado en cuanto a ciudad y abiente de la epoca+Es un sandbox interesante a la hora de explorarlo Puntos debiles:-Monotono a veces hasta la medula-La escasa variedad de ejecuccion de enemigos y de armas-La historia de Desmond no recobra mucho protagonismo salvo al final, pasa a un segundo plano-A veces es absurdo preparar un asesinato con demasiados desafios, pues el procedimiento no se diferenciara mucho			",118,3,4,9,5,1,10

												The ancient and medieval settings and storylines of the world of Assassin's Creed have a really spellbinding effect that will likely keep you holding on for the next installment (of which there are many by now).  If ancient conspiracies (regardless of their validity) and the like peak your interest, then you'll certainly enjoy the bizarre storyline evident in this series.The free-running gameplay in pretty enjoyable, though it evolves and becomes better as the series runs along.  All the ancient cities are well designed for bounding across rooftops and clambering over walls while you avoid the city guard and Templars.I hadn't played a game with combat set up like this before I gave it a try, and it's a very rewarding feeling to get the timing just right to dodge, parry, and deliver a killing blow to any number of attackers.  Obviously the system of ""Everyone attack, just one at a time"" is realistically silly, but it makes the game simple enough that you aren't ever overburdened, as long as your timing is up to par, even when facing more than ten attackers.The missions are enjoyable at first, but they tend to get repetitive after a while, as there are only a handful of different types of mission.And oh god, the flags, they do nothing.  Don't waste your time, unless you're just a %100 kinda guy.			",92,20,1,9,8,0,2

												Don't let the low playtime (as of this writing at least) fool you, I've spent a lot of time with this game on other platforms.The first Assassin's Creed game, while still a good game as the thumbs up can carry, is honestly inferior to the sequels in quite a few ways.The game itself is repetitive and frustrating at times, the campaign essentially consisting of three or four mini-quests in new locations you can complete all of or some of for the same reward before an assassination ni one of threecities. This is repeated many times with roughly the same conersation taking place at each turn and only slightly more exposition offered. This brings in pacing problems (admittedly present in most AC games) in that the story moves quickly at the beginning, slowly for around 10 or so hours of gameplay, and then moves into the endgame of Altair's story like a runaway train while Desmond's story builds up to reveals (and ultimately letdowns) in the future games.In summary:Fun mechanics in an open world that have been improved in future gamesInteresting story with some pacing problemUnfortunately repetitive campaign.Final verdict: Probably buy it on sale. <10$ or so, but it's a good game.

												The original Assassin's Creed is a great game for it's time. It has a lot of excellent elements (jumping off tall buildings, climbing buildings, etc.) that made it feel fun. However, the game definitely shows its age. The graphics and game play (particularly some of the climbing controls) can be dated and/or frustrating at times. In addition, I noticed quite a few clipping and other strange bugs during taller climbs and some of the fights I had.But, as the original epsiode of an excellent series, it definitely is wroth one playthrough.

												A very good game, though not in my top list by any means. Had some great gameplay elements but was repetative enough to lose it's charm before the end. Combat was smooth and well executed, though I prefer a style that doesn't rely so much on timing and simply learning specific enemies' moves. The open world was very well executed and clambering around the cities never really got old, which says a lot for the game. The really repetative part though was the missions. There were only 3 or 4 mission styles that could each be executed in the same manner and I found myself losing track of which mission I was on simply because they were that similar.The other games in the series improved upon the failings of the first though, so if you want to play those, it would be worth playing the first just to get the storyline.

												Well, I've been warned that this is the most dull entry in the saga.There's repetition in the ""quests"" you'll have to undertake - but most of them are optional and may be avoided. (You may not want to avoid them in the beginning, because you'll benefit from them.)But the world! It's a fantastic place and the cities are a sight to behold.Also, even I, clumsy as I am, had a blast jumping, climbing and stalking through these scenes - this games makes you feel much more competent than you are, which adds a lot to the fun.The story has an interesting spin (you'll see right at the beginning).All in all very recommended. I'm looking forward to the other entries in this series.Here are some play tips (very mild spoilers):Don't try to collect all flags. This is seriously madness and not needed, unless you are unhealthily obsessed :-)You can skip ""save the citizens"" sidequests BUT every 15 finished sidequests (informer quests, view points scaled, citizens saved) your hit point increase by one and you may even gain extra abilities, which helps a lot. You max out at 20 (two bars), so plan accordingly.I'd always scale all view points. These discover side quests and reveal the map, which is helpful when fleeing or planing to strike.You don't need to do all informer quests (3 out of 6). The info gained is not that helpful either. But - see above.			",334,56,7,57,26,2,82

												I finally finished the game, overall I thought the game was really good. Good story line, awesome parkouring and assassinations. Great graphics for a game made in 2009, the setting of the Third Crusade is really interesting, must play if you're a fan of that kind of setting. I finished most of the challenges and climbed all the view points, except for getting all 500 flags.So if you're new to the game and is interested in it, beware, the gameplay is REALLY repetitive. You're pretty much doing the same thing for 70% of the game. The storyline makes up for it even though I didn't catch the dialogue sometimes, Ubisoft really should have included a subtitles option. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing if you're interested in the AC franchise, people may tell you to skip to the sequel but I like playing games in chronological order, especially in a franchise. I bought this game on a summer sale and it was worth every penny.			",31,1,0,0,1,0,0

												Many gamers like to loathe the first Assassin's Creed game for a very specific reason: it's a repetitive title. The entirety of the gameplay consists in riding an horse near patrols of guards with a strict max velocity policy on very large distances, reaching a city, performing some side-quests which remain exactly identical till the end, gameplay-wise, and then, at last, performing your assassination. And off you go again.I'd say too it's something that can drive you away from the title. However, Assassin's Creed got two features that I was never able to find in the following sequels:1)The game really made me feel like an assassin, having to reach the target's town and gathering information before planning my move. Also, unlike Assassin's Creed II onwards, in the first title you are far from a killing machine: leave the scene and hide is always the best solution, here. Also, no economic or risiko mechanics: very interesting, I won't deny it, but not very fitting to a group of shadows which main purpose is to stealthy eliminate menaces to humanity2) Assassin's Creed spots very interesting villains in the Templars, who are mostly portraied as anti-villains and well intentioned extremists. Their final speeches are the main highlight of the game's plot, in my opinionSuffice to say, I really think Assassin's Creed the first is the only worthy game of the series this far, with Assassin's Creed III coming very close to give me the same feelings			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												This is a recommendation with a caveat.Assassin's creed gave the feeling of King's Quest, Prince of Persia, and Thief mixed in with an interesting storyline and compelling gameplay.The caveat is that the game has three parts that are essentially straight up repeats of the previous, just with more story progression. Each city is the same round of tasks after the first.That said, the story is decently written and gameplay fun enough that playing through the game is worthwhile.It's also a great start for the even better sequel.

												Classic game. If you're new to the series then this game is very fun. However that fun dies out after a while as you just repeat the same missions over and over again. The best part of the game is free-running and the actual assassinations. The setting in the Crusades is pretty cool and the world is well-rendered. Other than that, the game is quite mediocre. The story is okay.  It definitely has its cool moments though so buy it if it's on sale. Assassin's Creed II makes references to this game so I'd recommend playing this before the 2nd one, but it's not necessary if you just want to enjoy the gameplay.			",249,82,2,19,11,2,19

												While not as refined as latest games in the franchise, Assassin's Creed manages very well to deliver a good amount of action and stealthiness (Unfortunately, something that is getting behind in latest AC games), our hero is Altaïr, an assassin, loyal to the order and master assassin at a young age, who carries out the assassinations ordered by his mentor. 1191 is the time, the Third Crusade is devastating the land and we have 9 targets to terminate, as well as to find a rare artifact capable of magical powers. During the game we will have to learn all sort of abilities that will help us fight the enemy and avoid danger by using stealth skills, though, this is one of the game's main characteristics, sometimes it feels painful to learn or they just don't feel satisfying. The game tends to suffer from a serious case of  consolities , but in the end, once you manage to learn all the skills and keys that do x movement, you will be ok. On AC, it's the first time we face tail missions, something that feels really good here, but that due to its repetitiveness felt annoying on the next AC games. Even the stealthy missions were cool and delivered a good result in the end.Also, a positive point of the game is its locations and historical events occurring while we carry out our assassinations. All cities and the Holy Land are depicted in good manner and you feel the tension between the two important religions there, another point in favor are the historical characters involved in the conspiracies and actions we see and hear of during our missions. Maybe something I already feel sick of  are the collectibles. There are hundreds of them all over the places we visit, the good thing is we are not forced to collect them, but still manages to distract me, this is because they appear in every AC game! I hope they get rid of them once and for all.Updated: While replaying AC once again, I started paying attention to the camera angles and movements, firstly, the camera is really jerky and awkward preventing me from contuining my journey after liberating civilians or helping people in distress, this happened everytime I acted this way making the fluidity of the game a terrible experience at times. On a side note, kudos for an almost bug free game, I barely met any glitches around, something I am grateful for!I totally recommend this game for people that feel hesitant whether they should pick this game or that want to try the franchise, it is a fun, kind of a repetitive game, but that delivers an interesting concept about history, religion and characters and of course an appealing fictional storyline.

												My favorite of the series.... :-)No, the gameplay isn't the greatest.  It's very repetitive in its mission format, combat, and even aesthetics.  AC2 greatly improved upon those aspects, absolutely.What the original Assassin's Creed has is a story, a journey for Altair and Desmond Miles.  Both are paths of discovery and debate, a testing of iron against philosophical iron.  As Altair questions the precepts of the Assassin's Order and Templars, Desmond learns more of how the conflict in the Crusades applies to him in the modern age.  The plot is beautifully and intelligently (for prose fiction) presented to the player in a way that reveals tidbits consistently, yet subtly.It's a shame none of its sequels have ever matched the caliber of moral discourse in this title.  However, for the presentation of the plot alone, with its twists and back-and-forths, along with a cliffhanger of epic proportions, Assassin's Creed is a game worth experiencing.

												If you are new to the franchise I'd recommend starting with AC2, however if you are already a fan, this is definitely worth picking up during a sale. This is the root of the franchise and has repetitive missions and flaws, but I really enjoyed seeing the completely different setting and it also is the most realistic AC to date imo and the assassins are really ruthless which was neat to see for once.

												The first game in what will be an epic saga from Ubisoft. You follow Desmond Miles as he's placed into a machine known as the Animus which allows the partcipant to relive key moments of an ancestor. The ancestor in question is an Assassin called Alair in what history remembers as The Crusades. The story is rich and environments the same. This is a must buy - no hesitation. After, you'll want to play it's sucessors Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and the upcoming (at the time of writing) Assassin's Creed: Revelations.			",135,6,2,9,19,0,28

												Beautiful game, even if you do not have a top tier card. Controls are awkward to get used to at first, but once you do, you will be at home in any of the series. The story is interesting, the game play length is great, no short 4 hour stuff that you see from other games. I havn't tried a speed run, but the game is way too beautiful to waste on a speed run. Pick it up, have a good time, and continue on with the rest of the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many gamers like to loathe the first Assassin's Creed game for a very specific reason: it's a repetitive title. The entirety of the gameplay consists in riding an horse near patrols of guards with a strict max velocity policy on very large distances, reaching a city, performing some side-quests which remain exactly identical till the end, gameplay-wise, and then, at last, performing your assassination. And off you go again.I'd say too it's something that can drive you away from the title. However, Assassin's Creed got two features that I was never able to find in the following sequels:1)The game really made me feel like an assassin, having to reach the target's town and gathering information before planning my move. Also, unlike Assassin's Creed II onwards, in the first title you are far from a killing machine: leave the scene and hide is always the best solution, here. Also, no economic or risiko mechanics: very interesting, I won't deny it, but not very fitting to a group of shadows which main purpose is to stealthy eliminate menaces to humanity2) Assassin's Creed spots very interesting villains in the Templars, who are mostly portraied as anti-villains and well intentioned extremists. Their final speeches are the main highlight of the game's plot, in my opinionSuffice to say, I really think Assassin's Creed the first is the only worthy game of the series this far, with Assassin's Creed III coming very close to give me the same feelings			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

Posted: April 27, 2014
												I am a late-joiner to the Assassin's Creed series and as of writing this review, this first installment is the only Assassin's Creed game I have played.The game is quite obviously built upon the mechanic of climbing things, be it a castle, a barn or a horsecart. Pretty much everything is climbable. The implementation is not perfect and will sometimes frustrate you, but it is for the most part solid and works well. Without doubt, the satisfaction of scaling buildings and jumping across rooftops lasts the duration of the game.Visually, the game is stunning for its time. In particular the draw distance is very impressive. Standing at the top of a tower in one of the game's cities and being able to see past the city gates and to the rolling hills beyond is a lovely eye-candy experience. This is definitely a strong point of the game.I must, however, point out that the game is very poorly optimised - something I believe is largely endemic to the Assassin's Creed series on the PC. Aside from the frame rate being hard-capped at 60fps, I very rarely found myself hitting this number and instead would hover somewhere between 30-40fps. This will turn a lot of people off and sadly there is no good reason or excuse for it. Obviously, this will annoy some people more than others. If you can ""tolerate"" a console-level refresh rate then you have nothing to worry about. For those used exclusively to frame rates of 60fps and above, however, you might as well give it a miss if you aren't willing to compromise on this aspect.Another major criticism I would level at the game is its lack of variety and its reptitiveness. After I progressed past the initial levels and into the game proper, I often felt like I was playing an extended tech demo. It's clear that the title was built upon the climbing mechanic and that the plot and design came second.This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing were it not for the fact that you pretty much do find yourself doing the same few tasks over and over throughout the course of the game, with random spatterings of narrative here and there. As someone who likes to complete all side objectives and acquire every collectable in my games, I found Assassin's Creed distinctly unrewarding in this regard. There are an (infamous) number of collectables in this game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What makes it is problem, however, are the literally non-existant rewards for actually finding all of them. The game also provides no tools to assist in your collectable hunt, instead simply relying on you meticulously combing every single inch of the maps in search of them. I disagree with this model simply because it takes up too much time unnecessarily. At any particular moment there are thousands of good games worth your attention - can you really justify spending an hour or two poking around a map looking for that one last pickup?Personally, I say no - especially when the game doesn't reward you for it.Despite this, I would say Assassin's Creed is worth most people's time, if only to set yourself up for the other installments in the series. One thing I have been told repeatedly is ""Don't play later Assassin's Creed games before playing the first"" and I can imagine why this makes sense. The game is novel provided you haven't played similar titles or other games in the series, and the meta aspect of the plot can be compelling, although you ultimately learn very little by the end of the game.For this reason, I recommend Assassin's Creed, if only to set yourself up to play the later installments in the series.

												This game is a little deceptive in its marketing, in that it's not really a game about assassination. Oh, sure, the assassinations drive the plot, and they are probably the high points of the game, but a lot of this game made more sense to me when I discovered it was originally concieved as a Prince of Persia spinoff. And that really is the case - the chase sequences and getting around the open-world environment generally consists of hopping and swinging around. It lacks the motivational buzzsaws and spiked pits of its forebear, but the combat and platforming is really remisicent of the Sands of Time series.A lot of people complain about the controls, and the ""one-button"" platforming can result in some annoying moments. When it works, it's delightful as you leap from beam to beam effortlessly. But sometimes, you'll be running across rooftops, trying to flee some guards, and running into a small raised portion you expect to spring over, when suddenly you cling to it like a koala as the guards surround you. The fault, to me, is largely in the environments, which at times have obstacles or areas the controls really aren't designed for.The missions are the simple fare you'd generally expect for an open-world game - go here, fight there, etc. Most missions are repeated over and over, making the assassinations a fresh breath of air between having to rescue scores of civilians. If you don't worry about completing every mission, I understand this game can be powered through in a few hours, like many open-world games. Most of the missions are simple and not terribly difficult, with the exception of some later stealth missions that are a frustrating exercise in trial and error.Despite being over half a decade old at the time of this review, the game is gorgeous. The environments are immersive and great, and the missions where you climb up to the top of a viewpoint never got old for me on account of the amazing vistas. About the only criticism that really can be leveled are the somewhat wooden faces during cutscenes. As far as game art goes, it's a great artistic achievement, with a distinctive environment.Combat is much like Prince of Persia, only the main issue is that basic timing with counterattacks will win nearly every fight. Most of my fights consisted on spamming attacks, and as soon as an enemy attacked, counter. The game often tries to punish you for transgressions with hordes of guards, which are easily dispatched to clear your wanted status. It's similar to the fighting systems from later games like Arkham Asylum or Sleeping Dogs, only plagued with one good solution to many issues.The story and setting are interesting and unique, even if the overall plot ends up a bit lacking. The assassination targets are often interesting and blatantly cast in shades of grey, often leaving it to the player as to whether or not their death was warranted. Unfortunately, many of the assassinations boil down to a plain fight, often without a means to perform a ""clean kill"". Despite the Crusades-based setting, it doesn't play heavily into the plot, and doesn't delve too much into matters of history, instead focusing on its own conspiratorial mythology. The modern framing sequences are interesting in their implications, but are hampered by strictly being a narrative device, not allowing the player any agency and a bare minimum of exploration.Despite the flaws, I'd generally recommend giving it a shot if it still sounds interesting, especially since it's regularly on sale during the Steam sales. It's a good barometer for deciding whether or not you'll enjoy the following games (which are major expansions and refinements on the gameplay presented there), and honestly it's worth trying as something quite different from an AAA developer. It's an experiment in a lot of ways, though, and you have to go in understanding it's a fairly flawed gem.Edit: Also ignore the flag collectibles entirely. It's one of the worst collectible systems devised and is entirely skippable, and you earn nothing more than having a spot filled in on your pause menu. Avoid.			",506,140,11,70,29,5,65

												Assassin's Creed is the beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. The first game, telling the story of Master Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, is an engaging and entertaining, story rich, and unique adventure into a combination of action, adventure, parkour and stealth. The game sets up, perfectly of course, an extremely lengthy (and profitable, at that) series of 'historical' discourse between the Assassins Guild and the Templars, who struggle for ideological and political dominance over mankind. While the series is played backwards through a machine, The Animus, in this game, 'popping' in and out of Altaïr's world is not disrupted by the frequent 'snaps' to reality as Desmond Miles. The PC version of this game unfortunately, while hard to control for some, has frequent crash issues, which disrupts the aesthetic and immersion of the game (and savegames too). This game is not necessary to understand the Assassin's Creed series, but it sure does help, and the PC version is bearable.Score: 72/100			",120,6,0,13,11,0,19

												Interesting title. Altair's story in the past is quite interesting, but the Desmond's story in the present works more like a backstory than anything else, works fine with other titles in the franchise, but is meaningless by itself. Altair as a character is... strange a little, but he turns from an unlikeable dummy to quite likeable merciless killer! Yeah, I did just say that, likeable merciless killer, that's jut how it is. The game has its key standing in the franchise and goes really well especially with Ezio's trilogy, which is, by the way, following right after this, neat!.Assassin's Creed is recommended by just 1 out of 10 templars, but don't worry, that guy was a traitor and the others.. well, they didn't make it, the hidden blade is damn sharp.

												Take 'Hitman' and 'Prince of Persia' with a hint of 'Deus Ex' conspirancy and a touch of Dan Brown's historical revisionnism and you get this series pilot.

Still, this has bestseller written all over it's DNA and it's no wonder the series is one of the biggest videogame franchises of all time.

												It's a good game and a great start-up to what is now an amazing series. It does have quite an expansive game world and the storyline (as a whole) is quite compelling. It does have a very large repetiton factor, with exactly the same set of pre-assassination tasks to complete for each target. What I liked most about this game was is the way it made me question what was true, right and fair in the world. As Altair moves along his quest, he starts to change the way he looks at the world. This then translates into the games message.Overall, a solid game that took me 24 hours to 100%,  8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, I would like to start by saying that this game was nicely done considering its age and the captivating series it later became is just a plus. Even thought i do recommend it, I wanna talk about some issues i experienced on my own and state my own opinions. If you are interested in reading my issues, please read further on as i encourage it, however, if you do not care please only read the next 2 sentences. I recommend this game only to long-time fans of the Assassin's Creed Game Series, if you have played the newest ones and expect this one to be just like it, you're wrong. You can easily skip this game and be caught up story-wise in the 2nd game; there's no specific reason to play this game unless you're a huge fan because it isn't necessary. My Issues:1) I experienced no lagging frames issue despite hearing so much about it on the YouTube.2) I found the keyboard controls to be a bit too demanding to memorize and quite frankly uncomfortable on my hands, so i used a Gamepad. I had to set the commands and actions myself, so that was a bit of a chore.3) Now to the game's story istelf. It was a little too boring for my taste; i remember predicting the ending minutes after starting the game.4) I had another issue about how fast travel was not introduced until later on in the game, making it a chore to go from city to city on horseback and just punishing on foot.5) My biggest issue; no matter what you do or how inconspicous you are, the guards are always suspicious of you! Okay, i understand that you are dressed in Assassin robes, but come on, you literally get busted for no reason!6) Side missions should be completed before you assassinate the target in the city for full memory synchronization.7) 100% completion is not worth the hassle.Thanks for reading, hope i helped you make up your mind!

												Great game! You run around a BIG world killing people, some of who seem deserve it, but stabbing, slicing or throwing knives at them. As you play you skill list increases until you reach a virtual god level of invicability.Even though it's a little old now it still looks pretty damn good. I woudl say, after a whiel it does feel a little rinse and repeat, but pretty much all open world games do. There are also minor bugs that can bee kind of annoying (I talking about that stupid 'climb' a pebble when you need to running fool), but nothing that is really detrimental.It has a really fun parkour thing going on that makes you feel like you are being pretty damn awesome when infact you are really just pressing one button. Plus, when you get the counter skills you really can get a lot of fun out this game. This was infact the 3rd time I've played it and still enjoyed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For it's time, a groundbreaking game.  I really enjoyed it and have played through it 3 times now.  The last time modded out with updated graphics.  The storyline was the best part.  Some of the busy work isn't that bad since it was the first game in the series but they should have learned that gathering flags and feathers is a waste of time.  The following games improve on the story line but sadly they also continue the busy work side quests.  For people with OCD like me, this can be a nightmare because we want to complete the game in it's entirety.  If you can complete the mission without them, just ignore the side quests and go for story line.  It will be much more enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best way to play this game, and all AC games for that matter is to pause and read about the historical background they are based on. Makes the the world more alive and the immersion more intense. As far as the game is concerned the gameplay and is a little clunky but it's a 2008 game. Graphics are holding out decently even to this day. Great way to learn more and get interested in the 3rd Crusade.			",121,4,5,5,10,0,10

												I am a late-joiner to the Assassin's Creed series and as of writing this review, this first installment is the only Assassin's Creed game I have played.The game is quite obviously built upon the mechanic of climbing things, be it a castle, a barn or a horsecart. Pretty much everything is climbable. The implementation is not perfect and will sometimes frustrate you, but it is for the most part solid and works well. Without doubt, the satisfaction of scaling buildings and jumping across rooftops lasts the duration of the game.Visually, the game is stunning for its time. In particular the draw distance is very impressive. Standing at the top of a tower in one of the game's cities and being able to see past the city gates and to the rolling hills beyond is a lovely eye-candy experience. This is definitely a strong point of the game.I must, however, point out that the game is very poorly optimised - something I believe is largely endemic to the Assassin's Creed series on the PC. Aside from the frame rate being hard-capped at 60fps, I very rarely found myself hitting this number and instead would hover somewhere between 30-40fps. This will turn a lot of people off and sadly there is no good reason or excuse for it. Obviously, this will annoy some people more than others. If you can ""tolerate"" a console-level refresh rate then you have nothing to worry about. For those used exclusively to frame rates of 60fps and above, however, you might as well give it a miss if you aren't willing to compromise on this aspect.Another major criticism I would level at the game is its lack of variety and its reptitiveness. After I progressed past the initial levels and into the game proper, I often felt like I was playing an extended tech demo. It's clear that the title was built upon the climbing mechanic and that the plot and design came second.This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing were it not for the fact that you pretty much do find yourself doing the same few tasks over and over throughout the course of the game, with random spatterings of narrative here and there. As someone who likes to complete all side objectives and acquire every collectable in my games, I found Assassin's Creed distinctly unrewarding in this regard. There are an (infamous) number of collectables in this game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What makes it is problem, however, are the literally non-existant rewards for actually finding all of them. The game also provides no tools to assist in your collectable hunt, instead simply relying on you meticulously combing every single inch of the maps in search of them. I disagree with this model simply because it takes up too much time unnecessarily. At any particular moment there are thousands of good games worth your attention - can you really justify spending an hour or two poking around a map looking for that one last pickup?Personally, I say no - especially when the game doesn't reward you for it.Despite this, I would say Assassin's Creed is worth most people's time, if only to set yourself up for the other installments in the series. One thing I have been told repeatedly is ""Don't play later Assassin's Creed games before playing the first"" and I can imagine why this makes sense. The game is novel provided you haven't played similar titles or other games in the series, and the meta aspect of the plot can be compelling, although you ultimately learn very little by the end of the game.For this reason, I recommend Assassin's Creed, if only to set yourself up to play the later installments in the series.

												This game is a little deceptive in its marketing, in that it's not really a game about assassination. Oh, sure, the assassinations drive the plot, and they are probably the high points of the game, but a lot of this game made more sense to me when I discovered it was originally concieved as a Prince of Persia spinoff. And that really is the case - the chase sequences and getting around the open-world environment generally consists of hopping and swinging around. It lacks the motivational buzzsaws and spiked pits of its forebear, but the combat and platforming is really remisicent of the Sands of Time series.A lot of people complain about the controls, and the ""one-button"" platforming can result in some annoying moments. When it works, it's delightful as you leap from beam to beam effortlessly. But sometimes, you'll be running across rooftops, trying to flee some guards, and running into a small raised portion you expect to spring over, when suddenly you cling to it like a koala as the guards surround you. The fault, to me, is largely in the environments, which at times have obstacles or areas the controls really aren't designed for.The missions are the simple fare you'd generally expect for an open-world game - go here, fight there, etc. Most missions are repeated over and over, making the assassinations a fresh breath of air between having to rescue scores of civilians. If you don't worry about completing every mission, I understand this game can be powered through in a few hours, like many open-world games. Most of the missions are simple and not terribly difficult, with the exception of some later stealth missions that are a frustrating exercise in trial and error.Despite being over half a decade old at the time of this review, the game is gorgeous. The environments are immersive and great, and the missions where you climb up to the top of a viewpoint never got old for me on account of the amazing vistas. About the only criticism that really can be leveled are the somewhat wooden faces during cutscenes. As far as game art goes, it's a great artistic achievement, with a distinctive environment.Combat is much like Prince of Persia, only the main issue is that basic timing with counterattacks will win nearly every fight. Most of my fights consisted on spamming attacks, and as soon as an enemy attacked, counter. The game often tries to punish you for transgressions with hordes of guards, which are easily dispatched to clear your wanted status. It's similar to the fighting systems from later games like Arkham Asylum or Sleeping Dogs, only plagued with one good solution to many issues.The story and setting are interesting and unique, even if the overall plot ends up a bit lacking. The assassination targets are often interesting and blatantly cast in shades of grey, often leaving it to the player as to whether or not their death was warranted. Unfortunately, many of the assassinations boil down to a plain fight, often without a means to perform a ""clean kill"". Despite the Crusades-based setting, it doesn't play heavily into the plot, and doesn't delve too much into matters of history, instead focusing on its own conspiratorial mythology. The modern framing sequences are interesting in their implications, but are hampered by strictly being a narrative device, not allowing the player any agency and a bare minimum of exploration.Despite the flaws, I'd generally recommend giving it a shot if it still sounds interesting, especially since it's regularly on sale during the Steam sales. It's a good barometer for deciding whether or not you'll enjoy the following games (which are major expansions and refinements on the gameplay presented there), and honestly it's worth trying as something quite different from an AAA developer. It's an experiment in a lot of ways, though, and you have to go in understanding it's a fairly flawed gem.Edit: Also ignore the flag collectibles entirely. It's one of the worst collectible systems devised and is entirely skippable, and you earn nothing more than having a spot filled in on your pause menu. Avoid.			",506,140,11,70,29,5,65

												Adding to what most major commentors have posted, I feel that most do not mention or even consider the context of this game, in regards to its problems as well as achievements: Most reviews are written several years post release, and it started to get the attention it deserved by the masses starting AC2, which was 2 years after release.To start, this game is a very deep and plays magnificently with your imagination.+ An audience which does not consider philosophical/theological as well as historical, anthropological and political matters will not get the full depth of this game. Since it will not resonate or inspire their imagination as much.+ Supporting the previous point: the historical accuracy/plausibility is brilliant, considering how history is normally retold in the media.+ In connection to the first point: The main character is not as bland as he seems (nor does any other character to be honest). We have seen multiple main characters in many other games that said and did less. Clearly this main character hasn't resonated with everyone in the audience, but not everyone is capable of understanding the depth behind his statements, the fact that they're at times laconic gives them more depth (however, not everyone perceives it so).+ A great many small details which show the care of the development team (ex: the changing of the sword which you carry as the game progresses, this is not easily noticeable. Enemies that are not hit fatal blows will yell and bleed on the floor in agony, just as real sword battles should do. You can even end their misery. Ability to switch between weapons and fighting styles, very easily. Environmental ambience, architecture, music, character modelling, and actors. They thought of having the A.I react to you climbing, by throwing rocks at you. Having an enemy climb down a ladder while you are on it, they will kick you. Ability to push enemies off roofs to their deaths mid-combat. Tons of details)+ A wide range of new inovations or smoother implementations of mechanics and aspects are presented in this game, which makes it more noteworthy. (i.e: freerunning, melee combat, horse riding)- Game is made for consoles, so the PC version has more bugs and glitches. Full HD resolution is also unstable, which is why it is greyed out in the menu. I have replayed this game on xbox without facing any bugs, however I tried to revisit it on PC and it was a bit bothersome, especially with the game randomly crashing at times (since, I was trying to play it in full resolution.+ The amazing quality of the graphics (in full resolution only), everytime I revisit or look again at this game, I am simply amazed by how visually appealing this game is.-+ The repetitive format of the missions was for a reason, adding to the realism by needing to scout and survey before actually doing the mission. (This along with a few other small aspects from AC 1 and 2 are echoed but not well enough in AC:Unity). However, I agree that it negatively impacts that section of the game's replayability. +But these are optional and you are not forced to complete them.-+ Hand to hand combat isn't that great either, the fact that the option is there is good though (however you are forced to use it in some side missions), but the ability to use it to throw enemies as a finisher is pretty cool. In AC 2 they address this melee problem and make it very desirable to use since you can start using any enemy weapon through this, also fun to watch disarms (I'm not sure about being able to kick your opponents when they're on the ground was added in AC 1 or 2, so I wont place it).+-Not being able to swim isn't a negative, considering how much the developers worked on the huge range of things in the game. I think the reason they did this (choosing not to implement swimming) was because of the A.I, which might be why in the following ACs, the AI still cannot swim and die when they touch the water. + Adding to the previous note on Altair, his voice actor here is brilliant, unlike the later AC:Revelations actor who gives the young version of Altair a very American Hollywood accent. Then again, a big part of the original team, including Patrice Désilets (One of the main creators of the game) was forced to quit around the time of the development of AC:Brotherhood (which I consider the beginning of the winding road which sent the series to its demise, losing most of what it originally had, with whatever remaining as bare bones).+ This game replies to real world context of a prejudiced audience and biased media. Which again, links to the first point regarding the historical links, philosophy, movement of people and ideas. I truly felt (and still do) that this game broke through multiple barriers. To elaborate on this character's development, and compare him to the similar theme with other AC main characters. We see him in the beginning as brash, arrogant and impetuous. However, when faced with the reality (of whatever, the real world, 'the truth', responsibility, or you could consider all the above), they quickly mature and become the wise and calm sage-like individuals (or at least calmer, they're still human). This again links to the pursuit of knowledge, truth and philosophy, mentioned above. We see this pattern with all the main characters, but most quickly with Altair, which Ezio remarks on in admiration when he was discovering the past of his ancestor. This is why I liked AC:Revelations more in comparison to Brotherhood, since you get to see the older Altair as well as the older Ezio, with the similarities more explicitly shown, and one of the many patterns of humans and individuals is shown, simply put as 'the repetition of history', which is another major theme in the series.And replying to 3 unique criticisms, which I felt rated the game on idealistic, current (2014-2015) expectations:-Little Interaction with crowds: What? This game putting in a huge and vibrant crowd, which is pretty amazing considering its pioneering position. In the sequel which is released 2 years later, they make it possible to hide within crowds. In this game however, you see early mechanics of such, ex: sitting on benches between people, using monks to hide between them as your crowd to blend in. -Emptiness between cities: this “emptiness” was quite a rich area, which showed small farming towns, with farmers, military outposts, trade checkpoints, patrols, rich and diverse landscape of the Levant, with mountains and open fields. It was actually quite impressive, and a great way to explore the new horse riding system they implemented.-The cliff-hanger ending: This game was released as simply “Assassin’s Creed” and not “Assassin’s Creed: Arrival”. The game needed an ending which showed the continuity of the story and history, that you (as desmond) are nothing special, and that you are simply a piece of a long line of others like you. And at the time of the release, it was not certain that they would or would not make a sequel, which is why they left it with a possibly open ended ending so to be able to carry on from it. I remember it was amazing to see such an ending and I truly hoped to see a continuation, which was very well done with the elaboration regarding the First Civilization and conspiracy theories (I can’t say the same about the  later conspiracy puzzles and such, which for example: was noted in Brotherhood for its sub-par quality in comparison to 2, which is why they completely removed those conspiracy puzzles).Thus in context, this game did so much that was right for its time, that it released a very long and drawn out series because of it. A very similar comparison is with CoD 1 and its later successors.In summary, this is one of the games that I would consider well made and it doesn't deserve the 7/10s that have been posted by so many others. This game truly deserves a 9.5/10 considering the huge step it to it took in so many aspects.			",184,44,4,26,17,5,46

												Take 'Hitman' and 'Prince of Persia' with a hint of 'Deus Ex' conspirancy and a touch of Dan Brown's historical revisionnism and you get this series pilot. If the premisse of this anti-GTA is absolute genius, the gameplay is more casual and can get repetitive and somewhat contrived through the 9 hits you perform around Jerusalem, Damascus, Acre and etc... during the crusades. Still, this has bestseller written all over it's DNA and it's no wonder the series is one of the biggest videogame franchises of all time. This is where it all started with epic graphics (way in advance for 2007 this feels more like a 2012 release and you will need a powerful pc to run it well and get all the eye candy) and a strong storyline that opens the mysteries and sets the tone of the episodes to come.

												First off, I want to say that I will be reccomending AC - but only just. At it's time of release, it was a brave entry with its mix of free running and stealth based gameplay. It is immersive, and gives you a real feel of the history and geography of the third crusade. The graphics arent too bad for its age either. One of the main reasons I would play this is the story, as it provides alot of the starting canon for the rest of the franchise. Each assassination feels purposeful, and taking a life has a consequence. Some of the targets I developed a personal anger towards when learning of their deeds, which indicates the strength of the writing. However, for the good there must be bad. For a start, it runs badly. Freezes throughout loading menus and occasionally in game - often mid combat which is awkward. The investigations required for the assassinations are repetitive, and tend to turn the game a bit grindy when you are performing them. The combat for some reason I just cannot fathom. I appreciate not all blows would be blocked, but the counter system makes little sense in the type of attacks that can be blocked. It boils down to luck - or maybe I am missing something. Late in the game the number of enemies is honestly ridiculous, and when you are surrounded by enemies winning is nigh on impossible. It got to a point on a number of occasions when I rage quit and resolved to watch the remaining cut scenes online. The missions themselves are sometimes hit and miss, I can't tell you the number of times I fell in that damn harbour, I mean, an assassin that can't swim? Really? For all this however, it probably is worth playing. Just dont expect an odessey, I went out of my way to explore and got less than 20 hours. P.S. THE TOP ASSASSIN CAN'T SWIM? SERIOUSLY?

												Playing through Assassin's Creed Brotherhood a second time has inspired this review. That is a great game, but the ending of it is really rushed, and because ACB puts so much emphasis on advancing a story, the rushed ending really hurts the game. Assassin's Creed (1) gets criticism for being repetitive. But all AC games---and games in general---are repetitive. AC2, the pinnacle of the series, has a lot of stuff to do, but all of that stuff outside of story is centered on making money, which ultimately makes the game feel repetetive for repetition's sake since skills granted by money don't help your progression through the story (the most fun and straightforward way to finish AC2 is with your hidden blade, so all other purchased weapons are peripheral). In AC1, repetitiveness arises from the structure of the game. There are three cities, each with three different districts. You have to complete about five (or six, if you include the vantage points) different kinds of missions to advance the plot and unlock new territories (whereas the feeling in subsequent AC games is that story unlocks new areas). One question then becomes: is the repetition of the structure of AC1 too simplistic? For me, the answer is no, because the variety of settings, combined with the challenge of stealth (it is harder in this one) makes AC1's repetition more complex than AC2's wait for a timer to increase my florins. (Fortunately, AC2 relies more on story to keep you playing.)So the next question is: if story can make repetitive gameplay satisfying, is the story of AC1 good enough? AC2 has AC1 beat by a country mile in story. The anthology/Dickensian approch used to tell Ezio's tale compelling. But AC1's story is much more open ended. In AC1, you keep chasing after something very mysterious. Each target you kill tells you something as they are dying that upends your first impression of them. The motives of your enemies and allies becomes complicated as the game progresses, and you feel like a tool caught in the middle. Most later AC games kind of miss this mystery, as the villains and heros are more clearly (and frankly better) defined. So the open-ended story-telling makes up for the rather shallow character progression. So I think AC1 is a really good game, especially compared to later AC games (which I like a lot). The repetitive elements of the game are okay because they aren't too simplistic. The straightforward story is supplemented by great atmosphere.Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great no matter how many times you revisit it. The copious amounts of collectables didn't really hold any value to me nor my gameplay but it's a little nice minigame I suppose, however I'm not going to go out of my way to really collect a ton of flags for no real value in return.Aside from that the atmosphere each city gives you as you enter gives a very real experience of a living breathing city it's just fantastic. I do love the whole secrecy of the assassin brotherhood and templar factions where you dig through each memory dechiphering what's really going on behind the scenes through each leader's motives, it's excellent and gives you that sence of abundance of knowledge where you want to strive for more.Still one of my favourite Assassin's Creed games by far, you were such an important role to the brotherhood only to be stripped and having to work your way back up again learning so much in the process.The game has aged well for it's time and so has the controls, the climbing mechanics are timeless and still work well even with the occasional bug here and there (eg. leap of faith into hay when the hay turns hard and kills you lmao.)Soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is amazing, love the ""Access the Animus"" track especially in those fight scenes.I may have 11+ hours but it comes from experience from playing it on 360.The only real big problem with playing this on Steam is the controllers aren't compatible at all with this game, you need to search the Steam Community guides to apply a fix manually in the folders of your game which isn't hard to do but it's just still a small hassle to go out and actively do it when it shouldn't need to be.9/10 game.

												No wonder the series is such a commercial success: without experience yet of it's sequels, the abilities, modes and challenges are encapturing and stunning even at the beninning of the seires. In playing the game you are given the task of fighting the enemy from the ground and rooftops, evading the city guard and for the sake of it roaming and purging anyone you see fit. What a game for it's money; alongside a level system ideal for its sandbox agenda, it's a one-of-a-kind starter that distunguishes itself from any genre of action-adventure stealth games that fall between the boarders of Hitman and Crysis (not surprising, therefore, that the Assassin's Creed empire has spread so easily).

												Simply one of the best new IP's ever created; this is the game that started it all and, going back to play it again, one can see why. The series may have become bogged down by tired yearly-projects in recent days, but there was a sweet spot for this series in it's early days (namely the first through Brotherhood) that absolutely cannot be denied. There weren't any games like this when it came out, and there still aren't today. The delicate wire of written and unwritten history which it balances is masterful to say the least, and is a game that, since I played it when it was first released, has a certain feeling which permeates it, of which I, to this day, have never been able to shake. Although the ending has been much maligned, I personally loved it, and felt it truly serves as the final brush stroke that brings home the entire game, and imprints it on our memory forever, if you will only invest the time and allow it to.

												Being a long time AC fan, and having mastered AC 1 by having played through the story almost half a dozen times, once when it first came out, and the other times prior to each new AC release, I must say it still does not get old.For players new to the AC franchise, it is a fantastic first experience to the world of AC, a parkour, medieval combat, and stealth game all in one, perfect for history geeks, consipiracy fans, and behind the curtain enthusiaists. This game not only lets you relive history in a slightly alternative way, but it brings it into modern times by tying in ancient secret world orders that have survived for centuries and now run the world behind the scenes. Manipulating history and giving its own explanation of how we came to be. It might offend some of you who are died hard stubborn religious people, but if you can just get past that it is a game, you will definitely enhoy it. (I myself am religious and still hold AC as my favorite game franchise of all time).As for the AC fans who haven't played AC 1 yet, all I can say is that, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT, this is where it all began after all. Altair, the Grandmaster of the Assassin Order and most badass of all assassins. (Die hard Altair fanboy.) Apart from the previous, I will admit the game is pretty old and has it's flaws, it is buggy and VERY repetitive, but if you can just push through, you find it is a great introduction ,or re-introduction, into the Assassin world.11/10 would play and play and play again.

												It has some pretty major flaws, but I do still like it in spite of them. The free-running system was fantastic for its time, but the combat can get pretty monotonous as you wait for an enemy to attack. So much of the game involves doing random tasks for tiny bits of information about your target, so I would recommend doing the bare minimum required to unlock the assassination rather than repeating the tasks (which you'll be doing anyway) even more times.Unfortunately the game especially doesn't hold up next to its sequels, so if you're put off by the sound of this, I'd still recommend picking up AC2. It's a lot smoother and with less repetition.			",376,108,15,38,28,4,74

												Assassin's Creed. It's been 10 years since this game came out.. I've played it and replayed it over and over since 2012 and it's still one of my favourite Assassin's Creed games. But my views back then were different because there were only like... 5 main games. So what do I think now? well...Story:It starts off with Altair recovering an ancient artefact from Solomon's Temple. However, he manages to break 3 tenants of the creed. Once he returns with the artefact, the Templars track him down and kill the civillians and other assassins who live in the assassin HQ, Masyaf Castle. Everyone blames Altair for bringing them there so Al Mualim demotes Altair to a novice rank and makes him find and kill 9 templars who are trying to ensure the 3rd crusade continues. Altair kills all 9 but then the leader, Robert de Sable confesses it was actually Al Mualim who wanted to use the artefact to bring new world order. Altair then kills Al Mualim aaaand the rest is for Assassin's Creed Revelations.Also there's a modern story with Desmond Miles but... not much to talk about.Gameplay: The gameplay in this game is probably the weirdest to talk about. It's not great, because the games that came after were far better but it's definitely not the worst. Honestly, I think this game got 1 very important thing right: STEALTH. Stealth is what Assassin's Creed is about and it seems only this game can do it properly. The fighting is a little bit clunky at times but definitely not as easy as the likes of 3, Black Flag or Rogue. It's only when I played it on PC that I managed to figure out that sometimes if you counter then quickly press X, you can finish them off while they're recovering. I also like how the side missions end up helping you in the actual assassination mission. It suprisingly becomes easier, plus it'll tell you what you should do.Assassination missions:Tamir: Definitely the easiest. Just walk up to him and stab himGarnier de Naplouse: Make sure to stab him when he's talking to a patient. Otherwise he'll become Yoda and detect you while you're behind him.Talal: He just runs away... hold sprint and then stab him ._.Abu'l Nuqoud: Fat ♥♥♥♥er runs away and jesus christ he's like Dr Eggman in Sonic 2... faster than someone who should probably be the fastest.William of Montferrat: One of the best targets to kill. Running around in a fortress trying to not get detected... niiiceMajd Addin: He looks like Bin Laden. And there's a bunch of soldiers trying to kill you. Also quite fun.Sibrand: The worst ♥♥♥♥ing target ever. He's on a boat and you need to jump on ♥♥♥♥ing platforms to try and get to him. Don't get detected or he'll run away. Mistime a jump, you're falling into the water and dying. I've played this game like 5 times and every time, this mission ♥♥♥♥s me over. ♥♥♥♥ it and ♥♥♥♥ Sibrand.Jubair: This one is just... annoying. There's like 7 different people you need to kill and you need to find which one is the real Jubair. Robert de Sable: I used to find this one the most tedious. Both versions btw. In Jerusalem and Arsuf. But now that I basically know all the things you can do with the combat, I pretty much got past it in under an hour. I actually find it quite fun now. Cutting through a bunch of Crusaders and Saracens. It's good.Rashid ad-Din Sinan (Al Mualim): Very underwhelming... although I do like the fight, it could have been so much better.Music: The music in this game is really good. Very mysterious 'n♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not as good as 2, Brotherhood or 3 but still good. Jesper Kyd never fails.Overall: The game is still good and honestly, if Ubisoft made an updated texture pack for the PC version like they did with Watch Dogs 2, I'd be okay with that. I wouldn't mind a HD remaster either but as long as they show this game some love since it's the 10th anniversary... then anything is fine with me. The game can be repetitive in terms of structure, but it's still fun and definitely worth trying out.			",43,3,0,2,3,0,1

 TL:DR at the end, scored 6 / 10 as of 23rd May 2016  Full Livestream Playthrough soon!  Borba Recommends Borba likes:Genre - Assassin’s Creed is an open world action adventure, with elements of stealth and a very powerful storyline that will leave players aching for more.Narrative - A very deep narrative, with interesting and well thought out characters, dialogues and puzzling secrets to discover. Borba warns that the game ends in one hell of a cliffhanger, so have your credit card ready in order to get the next titles in order to unfold the whole series’ most valuable asset.Interface - Simple and functional, shows health, wanted status, equipped weapon, a radar and a much needed control helper, since the game has context based controls that might be hard to memorize at first.Graphics - It can be said that this first game in the series aged pretty well in terms of visuals, despite looking a bit bland sometimes due to some sort of colour filtering.Music - An epic music score is present throughout the whole game, improving the overall experience.Sound - Excellent voice work and combat sound effects, with some repetitive generic villager and guard voice lines.Borba dislikes:Replayability - The game offers side missions, collectibles and an open world to explore that is based on historical locations, but no achievements. Due to the repetitive nature of the game, only diehard fans will consider repeating it, or doing a full playthrough that may take a few dozen hours. Regular gamers that just want to play through the main quests will take between 10 and 12 hours to finish, and feel glad they finally got through it.Gameplay - The parkour system developed for the game was ingenious, and despite having some flaws and being slower than later iterations, it’s still pretty good for its time. Combat is original and functional, becoming a bit too easy once players get the hang of it. The repetitive investigation missions and the viewpoint unlocks are Borba’s biggest beef with the game, quickly becoming a mind numbing chore that ultimately feels necessary to extend the game’s playtime into an acceptable amount of hours.Design - The world design is amazing for its time, however, the repetitive gameplay tarnishes the experience. Also, there are a couple of missable events that allow the character access to a few files that will shed some further details about the narrative. Borba hates missable things in games.Polish - A few issues still occur, including crashes, lack of subtitles, controller issues and parkour / animation bugs, even though the game is pretty much playable from start to finish it’s a shame these were never fixed.Borba feels like despite the issues with repetitive gameplay, lack of subtitles and some bugs, Assassin’s Creed I is the stepping stone, a necessary evil, for players to get hooked into a very deep narrative, which on its own turns this mediocre title into a worthwhile experience for most players that endured through its repetitiveness. 6 / 10  ",1184,337,30,186,132,5,190

												Ah, the first amazing game in one, if not the most, amazing game saga of all time. Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut Edition is so amazing, with a gritty and brooding atmosphere. The game is fully open world, allowing you to fully explore the dark depths of actual places such as Damascus, and Jerusalem. There are plenty of opportunities to save helpless obese guys and screaming young Arabic girls. This game is very realistic, in which if you do anything socially unacceptable, such as stabbing people, the guards will take notice and chase you. In this case, you must break the line of sight by either climbing to the roof of a building or hiding behind your intimidating vigilante friends. This is not a game for the impatient though, as it takes time to slowly stalk a target and slide a blade into his rib cage without the citizens seeing you. If you are the type of person who would rather run in screaming, and wildly slash your way through the sword-wielding guards, then I would recommend some other game. Although, hacking guards is a large part of this stealth game. One of the largest building blocks in this game, (and every other AC for that matter) is parkour. If you like jumping over benches, scaling large walls, and swinging on beams to escape the soldiers who really don't like you, then this is your game. Although the controls are a little foreign at first, they become natural soon after you finish the ""tutorial"" level. The story is good, with many twists and turns, with a suprise ending. One thing this game lacks is cutscene quality, I mostly slept through the long discussions with the Bureau Leader. Although this game was made in 2007, it still holds its ground as very well constucted, with very good graphics (for 07) and a deep story. And, if you enjoy the other AC games, this is a great place to return to. Would stab and slash again: 8/10			",59,0,1,8,4,0,1

You just get the feeling that the developers were forced to release whatever they had done for the 2007 holiday season, whether it was ready or not. In that way, it reminds me a lot of the first Mass Effect - lots of great ideas, cool story and universe, but ultimately not as good as it should have been (which, like AC, was mostly rectified with the second game in the series).But first things first... let’s break down what works and what doesn’t. As mentioned above, what works are the ideas the game puts forth, both in terms of story and gameplay. The story centers on a clandestine battle between two orders - the Assassins and the Templars. You play as Desmond Miles, a present-day descendant of Assassins, who has been captured by an organization named Abstergo (the modern day corporate face of the Templars). Using a device called the Animus, Desmond is forced to re-live the memories of his ancestor, an Assassin named Altair, in order to find a mysterious artifact. The game is played from Altair’s point of view and takes place in the cities of Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, circa 1200. It is here that you can see where the majority of the work was put into the game. The cities are sprawling, alive, and built with tons of detail. You really do almost feel like you could be in those places at that time. It’s quite impressive, technically. Gameplay centers around two main mechanics - free-running and combat. Free-running allows you to run across streets, rooftops and climb buildings in a fluid manner. When it works, it’s great fun, but oftentimes you’ll accidentally fall off buildings or jump in a completely wrong direction or climb something you didn’t want to, etc. Clearly the developers hadn’t worked out all the kinks yet. The combat is interesting, but nothing special. There are lots of options and it looks great in motion, but it’s not particularly difficult or engaging. Simply mashing buttons usually works in most cases. However, you can clearly see the potential in it. So again... good ideas, but not yet implemented as well as they could be.Where the game ultimately fails is in the design. Assassin’s Creed 1 can basically be boiled down to the following: go to a city, climb a few towers, beat up a few people (or some other menial task), assassinate a high-priority target, return to home base. Repeat this 9 times and you’re done. It’s all very tedious and gets boring quickly. While there are a few different types of tasks and side missions that you can do in the cities, none of it really rises above being mediocre. The most interesting parts of each chapter are the final assassinations, but even in these cases, the verdict is mixed. Instead of actually being able to sneak around stealthily and assassinate your targets, many of these encounters just end up turning into a big brawl (not exactly what one would expect in a game involving secret assassins). Ultimately, the game is promising, but flawed. The ideas underlying the story are definitely cool and the environments are really nice (for their time), but as a game, it is simply average in most respects. It also doesn’t help that the Altair character isn’t terribly compelling and nothing really interesting even happens until the very end. That said, this game is worth checking out if the premise intrigues you and you think you might be interested in the series as a whole (which, for the record, DOES get better). If you think that might be the case, my recommendation would be to either skip this game entirely and watch all of the cut-scenes/ending online, or play through it doing only the barest minimum needed in order to continue. Grade: CNote: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												Don't buy this. Unless you're a some sort of crusades-nut, don't bother with this game. Jumping straight to AC 2 is going to give a lot better experience about the series, and from there you can either continue or not depending if you like it or not. Sure AC2 isn't as good as AC: Brotherhood, but if you're going to follow the plot, might as well start there. What happens in this game is not important at all, and can be skipped with youtube-videos or checking a short recap from a wikipage.This game isn't exactly horrible, but it has nothing compared to following installements. The plot is boring, gameplay is seriously lacking and there's just nothing to do after first few hours. From there it's repeating the same places and missions all over again. Some design flaws make the game sometimes feel a horrible experience, although it's because the game just drags on and on. Luckily there are only few bugs and technically the game is a solid piece of work. Still the game is not enjoyable after the beginning as it lacks substance. I thought I would like this more than the second one because of the theme, and some ill parts in the second, yet I found that the last few hours of the game made me almost hate this one.""Should you buy it?"" No.""But I want it, it's only few bucks/euros"". Still no, your time is more valuable than the money you're going to spend to this. And no point supporting this kind of work.			",193,41,1,16,12,4,50

												Being an assassin sounded cool, but in practice I thought this game was drab and dull. Almost nothing about the story made any sense at all, and was an incoherent mess. You can only climb to the top of a building and jump off into a pile of hay so many times before you begin to lose interest. For me, that took about 8.7 hours.			",126,24,0,28,9,3,23

												Looks nice, and the first hour or so is fun, but it fails to evolve or change in any way after that, so you may as well play the demo 10 times and watch the cinematics on Youtube. As a barely touched console port, the Exit to Windows button is about 8 menus and 2 minutes away from the game world.			",172,19,5,9,12,2,20

												*Friend* How is the studying to exam going??*Me* I'm about to kill the leader of the assassins who are actually a Templar!Anyway, for those of you who are wondering if i failed the exam, no i did not. i saved my progress and hope to continue next year. (;_;)This game is the first in the Assassin's creed series and that shows with weird controls and repetetive gameplay and no proper cutscenes. However, that doesn't mean it's bad. No, i actually enjoyed every second of it. the story is very slow at first and you have to play an hour or so to understand why you have gone back in time to play as your great great great x100 great grandfather Altaïr. who would much rather do a triple backflip on to a house that's 10 miles away and turn into a warewolf every third Thursday at full moon when Jupiter is right behind the sun's core and listen to Kanye SouthWest's new album than do leap of faith.this was my first time playing a assassin's creed game and i absolutely fell in love with this series. the ai have funny dialogs and i can easily spend an hour listening to them. there are so many different people that do different things. it makes this world seem real like this is what people did in those times when your parents were young and did not have phones or PCsBUT!!! if i meet one of those women who wants money one more time, i swear i will..... ohhhh!!! yeah i ♥♥♥♥ing hate them.The story, OMG. one of the main reasons i bought every single assassin's creed game there is. the story makes it 10 times more fun to play. i played blackflag for 20 min before i played this game and i didn't know why i went back in time or what they said about templars and assassinsi would recommened this game to anyone who's new to assassin's creed games, for those of you who have played the newer ones it might be hard to get used to the controls but i would still recommened it for the story.PS: i know this review is a mess. first time trying to do a proper review, give me some mosquito spray please!!

												Assassin's Creed was am amazing game when it was released. The gameplay was novel with fluid movement unlike any video game before, and the plot was intriguing and compelling. The plot is still just as good, but the gameplay has not aged well at all. The game requires a massive amount of grind through the mid-game and most of the end-game, and many games since have surpassed AC1's freerunning and combat (most notably, AC2).I recommened that players attempt AC1 as the intro point to the series. If the grinding becomes too much to bear, watch the remaining cutscenes and story missions on YouTube and move on to AC2.			",321,60,20,22,38,1,46

												Assassin's Creed is a rather enjoyable game. It has a pretty cool concept, the story is quite alright and free-running from rooftop to rooftop is extremely fun. You really feel like a skilled assassin when you are playing the game, at least for the most part. It gets harder and harder towards the end to dodge enemies and to make sure you're not discovered, but that's to be expected. You need to plan accordingly at times. The story takes place in an interesting era and is quite intriguing but sadly a bit forgettable. The combat (apart from the assassinations) is somewhat clunky and you can tell that it's a console port. You can play the game with keyboard and mouse but I recommend that you play with a controller if you have one since it's obvious it is meant to be played with one. I had a lot of fun with the game when it wasn't feeling repetitive. Climbing up to the view points was really fun and a few of them was a little bit challenging, too. I found myself enjoying climbing and exploring more than the combat itself.The visuals are stunning. The game is rather bright and takes place during daytime which is a bit odd for a ""stealth"" assassin game. The way Altaïr moves is also done extremely well, his movements are very smooth. As a nice treat; Nolan North is the voice of Desmond Miles - and you can't go wrong with that!A few negative things: Apart from being a console port with somewhat clunky combat, the game can get rather repetitive, especially towards the end. It also lacks subtitles which is crucial for many. Sometimes I had trouble hearing what was said in the game due to the background sounds. This is something to consider if you're like me and prefer to have subtitles. But all in all it's a nice game despite its flaws. It's a good game to start off a franchise with.

												I had Assassin's Creed when it first came out on Xbox 360. When it first came out, it was a novel game, running around, gathering information, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, and exploring beautifully rendered environments. Despite the control frustrations and the repetitive gameplay, it was still fun. However, with newer Assassin's Creeds coming out all the time, you can look back and see just how bad the original Assassin's Creed actually was. The game got completely left behind with its sequel Assassin's Creed II with a much better character, better mechanics, better almost everything (I think Lucy was slightly better modeled in AC1 over AC2...). Running around doing the same few things over and over and over again just to do one ""unique"" assassination, just feels more like a chore than fun. If you're thinking about getting this game for nostalgia, just skip it... unless you REALLY enjoyed it. If you've never played the Assassin's Creed franchise before and just want to start, seriously start with Assassin's Creed II. The story here isn't all that important and a nice recap is given at the beginning of Assassin's Creed II.			",252,59,1,63,72,4,91

												I love this game. The ability to free roam and parkour is awesome. Not to mention the hidden blade. Assassinate who you want and then do a leap of faith. This game stared out an open world, story driven, assassination game series. It is well worth the time in money to jump into the series.			",268,54,6,30,35,3,28

												Great story. Not as good as the later games but you gotta play it to go on to the later ones. A lot of people are saying that it sucks because it gets repetitive, but part of being an assassin is patience. Is there a basic recap of this game at the start of ACII? Yes; but if you skip this game you miss out on a very personal connection to the characters found within. Desmond will seem more relateable, Lucy will be much more human, and Revelations will make a helluva lot more sense if you can just sit down and have some fun with this. People are making it sound like this terribly boring and repetitve piece of crap when if you just sit back and be a little patient, the story will more than make up for sometime buggy game mechanics and slighly repetitive missions.

												What can I say about this game. Let's start with title it doesnt just scream♥♥♥♥♥in your face once, but TWICE. No but really, let's talk the gameplay? well I like the graphics espically for a game that came out in 2007, it is easy to say that they worked hard on impressing us... it was SHINY. The controls are so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, you are slow and when you try to sprint you jump into♥♥♥♥♥♥you dont want to, and when you want to jump you ♥♥♥♥ing run off a building. The story is great, probably the best part about it. I would give it a good 8/10 just because of how classic it is and how it started a whole series that won't end. Good work Ubisoft, you did it with Prince of Persia now you did it with the Assassin's creed. Should you buy it? Well if you wait on sale you can probably catch it for $4.99, but you could also use that money to buy a couple of cheese burgers. I don't know you should do what you want with your money, don't let me tell you what to do. :) I'd go for the game pirated and the cheese burgers. Well it depends what kind of cheese burgers, if it's from burger king no way. And also mcdonalds kind of sucks too, and who the ♥♥♥♥ wants Jack in the Box. Wow Hamburgers suck, get this game instead.			",540,114,10,37,48,5,71

												Впрочем, главным героем игры стал вовсе не закутанный в белый плащ хашишин. Закрутив любопытную карусель с двойным сюжетом, сценаристы выбрали на ведущую роль современного обитателя мегаполиса, по совместительству подрабатывающего барменом. Сторилайн берет старт в секретной лаборатории, где наш персонаж обнаруживает себя прикованным к странному аппарату. Ситуация проясняется крайне быстро. Оказывается, протагонисту посчастливилось оказаться потомком одного из известнейших наемных убийц древности, и теперь некая организация пытается выведать из него бесценные знания предка. Раскопки в памяти производятся с помощью системы ""Анимус"", позволяющей считывать воспоминания человека на генетическом уровне. Честь опробовать в деле научное ноу-хау как раз и выпала на долю парня – после короткой беседы, в которой была озвучена пара убедительных доводов о необходимости добровольного участия в эксперименте, на сцене появляется восточный ассасин.Плюсы: графика «wow»-уровня; превосходная акробатика; зрелищные «фаталити».Минусы: быстро утомляющий геймплей; сырая боевая система.

												A sandbox game with plenty of tedium added for good measure.Graphics are fairly decent. I have not compared to the console version of the game. In the PC version the graphics are not ground breaking but are functional and polished. Animations are smooth and environments are well realised. The cities are modest in size and look the part for the period the game is set. The streets are littered with things you would expect, haystacks, street murchants etc.Audio is good. The most noticable thing about the sound is the background music which fits more with the modern part of the modern/historical aspect of the story. Apart from that the audio doesn't really stand out in any particular way, everything sounds like you would expect.Gameplay is heavily story driven. The story and premise is fairly interesting. The historical part of the story (the important part IMO) is about a disgraced assassin trying to redeem himself. The protagonist sees himself as the bringer of justice etc.Unfortunately the games is boiled down to but a few core gameplay mechanics such as fighting/evading, eavesdropping and, and the main one, assassinating. This makes the game incredibly tedious. The meat of the story is the assassinations, but to get to that you have to do a set number of the other stuff first. Unfortunately the other side missions become tedious after just a few times because it is ALWAYS the same. After 20 hours of gameplay I completely lost interest and stopped playing. Travelling between locations is also uninteresting, but thankfully there is a quick travel option. One thing that I just can't understand is the requirement to walk when near the authorities, it just doesn't make any sense at all. In Hitman it is somewhat logical, you are in disguise so you must walk to maintain your cover, but in Assassin Creed you wear your assassin's outfit everywhere, so what difference does it make if you walk or run?The sandbox presentation is wasted on this game, I think it would have been more successfull as a linear mission based style like Hitman. The developers limited the core gameplay too much when compared to the likes of GTA.If you have plenty of time to waste, this is an above average game but the repetitive gameplay was just a bit much for me, I can't recommend it to people with limited game time. Take a look at Far Cry 3 if you want a really good sandbox, or the new Tomb Raider for a nice linear experience. Both of those games felt shorter than this even though they probably aren't and they both felt much more engaging and interesting.			",323,50,45,18,23,2,41

												Dull, boring, repetitive and clumsy. But very pretty. I really can't recommend this game unless you are completionist and want to know the storyline before moving onto some of the later, better, games. The control system is clumsy, ham-strung by being developed for a limited input system. Each area is repetitive and essentially boils down to: climb all the towers, save all the civilians, do a few races, beat some people up then assassinate the target. Repeat 9 times. The collection 'side quest' is infuriating, overly long and utterly pointless. How this game spawed such a winning franchise I do not know (but having played II I am glad it did). The good part I can highlight is it very pretty for when it was released and the free running is great fun (when things don't glitch...)			",369,77,13,77,37,3,80

												If you're even a little limited on time & patience and you just want to play this to get a complete story experince from AC series. I suggest to go on youtube and watch a clip which gets the story in 5-60 mins. If you have time and are determined to complete the whole series storyline this is fine. Just don't pay the full price for it.For a game made 2007 graphics, enviroment and sounds are suprisingly good, of course there is issues with e.g. drawing distance but they couldn't think that someone really plays this with a 2016 high-end machine. Main storyline is fine.PC gameplay is awful and the game gets easily pretty boring. Bad contrallability, clumsy combat, no quicktravel, tens of repeating and similiar mini-quests before you get to the real main quest and and such a stupid AI.I don't recommend this unless you are obsessed to get all the games in the series finished (or if you're unemployed)Pros:+Graphics (2007)+Story+SoundsCons:-Graphics (2007)-Gameplay (horrible character & camera controllability, clumsy repeating combat, etc.)-Repeating repeating repeating ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A war rages between two factions: the Templars and the Assassins. In this tale of redemption you won't always be able to tell if the side your working for is in fact, the right side, and that's part of what makes this game so brilliant.The introduction of parkour into the game industry was spearheaded by this series, along with the aspect of historical tourism that the game provides. This series is still at the forefront of these factors, and although the first game itself can be fairly repetitive, it's still an amazing game.The character of Desmond is interesting and the large amount of intrigue brought on by the ability to retrieve the passwords of those looking over your progress in the present day portion keeps the story rolling.85/100			",140,20,1,19,1,0,12

Game should of been 10-20hrs just solely on the story and it would of been fantastic.			",128,10,1,5,6,0,1

												Not a bad game story-wise but has it's fair share of issues. Very repetitive. And when I say very it means that each city you'll visit offers pretty much exactly the same informer quests, saving helpless old ladies and viewpoints. If you're going for completing EVERYTHING you're in for a extremely borring ride. Other issue is combat. While a lot of the time you can simply guard and the counter attack to dispose of the enemy, some attack were just completely not countereable. Not sure if that was a bug on my end or a feature, save to say combat got really annoying after a while, Overall not a terrible game but definitely the worse one of the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Read down for why i do not recommend this game.This IS a great game. I remember watching a friend play almost all of this game when it was first released on xbox 360 and i remember how blown away i was by its fluid character movement through games open world something i had never seen before this game. The game had amazing music, sounds, world detail, combat, and story that made me very very hopeful for the future of gaming. I remember saying to my friend that it would be the most amazing thing after a few more installations of this IP how great it would be to have the games story move into the modern era with Desmond taking town to new templars. While i have not actually played the rest of the overkill that is AC annual releases it does not seem to have done this yet… This game remains very good.HOWEVER!This is a Ubisoft Title and with that comes the 90% of the time fact that it will just not run on computers a few years newer than the game very well (ie XIII & Beyond Good & Evil)A few of things i ran into finally playing this game in the year 2015 and what i had to do to make it work for me.-Absolutely no in-game overlays can exist it will just crash. raptr, steam overlay, caused ShadowPlay caused crashes for me. Shadow Play also caused graphical artifacts and sound distortion randomly. (while having all of these turned off or disabled there were still time that game crashed but i was able to get past the title screen)-The game will crash at random times when you complete certain actions like killing a templar in the game world because the game tries to connect to ubisoft server that does not exist anymore. Its recommended that you turn off the internet to computer you are playing it on but you can also use your firewall setup to block it.-iirc correctly this game may have come out before the wireless xbox 360 setup was available for pc. I “think” it was patched in later in the version that you can buy on steam. So the game does see the “wireless” controller but by default it is set-up incorrectly the triggers serve as camera movements left and right but are opposite. the colors of the buttons and on screen prompts are counter clock-wise wrong by one position. this can all be fixed with a little bit of tinkering in the buggy options menu or in the ini files.-not as important but still relevant. this is an open world game with  many thing to find and collect. two of which i found rather pointless. Flags & Templars. They serve no real purpose in the game. they existed on the console version for achievements and trophies that do not exist on the pc version at all steam or uplay. This is not a uplay game just fyi it was long before it existed and was never incorporated. but anyways while i am usually one to take my time and find all of the things in games this game gave me no motivation to do so, neither achievements or in game unlockables… -the actual controls and character movements now feel very tank like. a sort of inbetween modern 3rd person games and classic tomb raider for lack of better comparison.In conclusion This IS a great game and it is very fun but it was not made to be future proof. It takes a good bit of work to enjoy. I can't recommend it on modern systems but if you are willing to do the work get it running it is a lot of fun perhaps mostly nostalgia.

												I started playing this game in 2016 after I completed AC2-ACRG and I feel like this is the best of the whole series. Of course the controls are classic and decent, but the main attraction is that Altair, of all main characters, presents the true faith of the Assassin's Brotherhood since he didn't started his path from some sort of passive tragedy or pressure of living. Altair and Shay are the characters whom I pay the most respect to.Highly recommended, even if simply for this belief.Nothing is true, everything is permitted. Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.			",27,3,1,1,0,0,1

												For starters, only play this game if you insist on playing it.  Other wise, just skip it.  It is not worth your money and it is a terrible game.  Here are some reasons why.The Bad StoryThe story is very generic and it's ending is laughable.  The characters are almost none existent and the story seems to have trouble developing itself, most notably towards the end of the game where the story just collapes in on itself and doesn't make sense anymore, leaving on an ending that leaves a very bitter taste in your mouth.  The story does have a few twists and turns you won't you see coming and they can be very suspenseful, but none of them last and are only small moments that shine.  As a whole, the story is unsatisfying and leaves much to be desired.GameplayNow, the gameplay as a whole isn't exactly bad.  In fact, it can be quite good.  For example, combat can be fun and satisfying and the free-run system is equally satifying.  However, the game mechanics work 90% of the time, but the other 10% it doesn't work makes the game infuriating.  The 10% is most notable whenever you are running away from guards, and Altair decides to have a panic attack and jump to whatever platform he feels like, coating himself with gorilla glue in the process, in order to stick to every pixel possible at the worst times.  It can be very difficult to control Altair during this instances and leads to possibly broken monitors.  As a whole, gameplay can be fun, but usually results in frustration due to annoying controls and error in game mechanics.The GoodStoryThe only good that comes from the story is the unexpected twists and turns.  I geniunely didn't see them coming and some of them did suprise me, leaving me somewhat interested in the story.GameplayThe 90% of the time that the game works, its enjoyable and fun.VerdictI only recommend this game to people who just want to beat the game to be able to say that they have played it.  If you are interested in it for other reasons, I say just look up a summary of the story on the internet and go and buy the 2nd game.			",127,10,0,19,5,0,8

												I want to reccommend this game, but this game is a prime example of how NOT to design gameplay and combat. Assassin's Creed is a story about a former assassin, now-turned bartender, named Desmond Miles. Captured by the multi-million dollar company, Abstergo Industries, Desmond is tasked with using a device called the Animus to relive the life of his ancestor from the 11th century, an Syrian assassin named Altaïr. As Altaïr, you have compromised the safety of the Brotherhood of the Assassins, and now, you must travel the country to find and eliminate the eight Templars currently in control of the country to help the people all across Syria. Now I love the lore and story in Assassin's Creed games, I really do. But I don't understand why people think AC is a great game in terms of gameplay, because simply put, it's not. The combat feels slow and clunky compared to that of future AC titles, throwing knives are overpowered, the parkour is buggy as hell, it's hard to control your character and overall, the controls are just a huge mess.The missions are repetitive, if nothing else. You go to a city, complete a couple of missions to get information on what your target is going to do, assassinate the target, and you're done. The actual evidence missions themselves are why this are repetitive. At least the Templars themselves have motives and goals as why they're doing what they're doing, but when retrieving information, the individual missions feel shallow, like they're nothing to them at all. Honestly, climbing towers to get information about the surrounding area and jumping into a pile of hay at the bottom is the most satisfying part about this missions.The only thing about this game that I can recommend is the story. I will say though, if you're looking for context in AC2 about the characters and such, I'd say buy it, but don't expect anything good to come out of the gameplay.  ",98,8,1,11,3,2,1

												A very laggy title of a thirdperson stealth action game.The pacing of Assassin's Creed suffers tremendously from high input latency and generally influent animations. Gameplaywise a lot of aspects that seem essential for a good Assassin's Creed title haven't been implemented, such as air assassinations.Citizens and the environment have an uninteresting and generally unappealing design.Missions lack diversity, as do enemy voice-lines that basically play on loop.It can get really anoying really fast.Combat system feels unforgiving and unrewarding.It is very sad that the first title of the glorious Assassin's saga presents itself in such a content-poor and unpollished way as bugs seem to be omnipresent and graphics are badly optimised.I'd say don't even bother with this title. It's a bloody mess.If you are interested in picking up the assassins saga I'd recommend you watching a playthrough of the first assassin's game.			",125,57,1,9,4,0,4

												You can explain Assassins Creed in one word and that word is ""Perfect"" I have never seen a character move around so smoothly in a game as in this game. The most realistic animations possible. Running, climbing walls, horse riding, fighting, jumping, it all looks amazingly good. The game is primarily taking place in middle east during the 12 century and the environment looks vey beautiful and has very nice graphics with nice screen effects such as when you take damage, when you fast travel e.t.c. Its a detailed game with high quality in graphics and gameplay. The fighting in the game is unique and is the most successful part of this game. The specific time click with the mouse makes it very fun and rewarding. Click at the right moment and see the awesome animations when you slay your enemy to the ground. You feel so very cool and powerful in the game when everybody has respect of you, they are begging for their life and are screaming in fear and pain when you slay the enemies. They will flee from you and the people around you will be screaming in panic. Its as awesome as it can be. The enemies are cocky and will mock you and its so great to show them who the real boss is. Highly addictive and fun. It works so well with the automatic climbing and running system in the game so its fun just to run around. The story is very good and smart. You are already a master assassin but you have been downgraded to the lowest rank in your ""clan"",so you have to start over from the basics. And its in the basics we want to start right? And by the time you do good things for the clan you'll get more and more of your gears back and you get to use your assassin skills again. (Its way better compared to assassins creed 2 when you are a complete noob that becomes a super assassin by touching his fathers clothes. So, utterly dumb.) The main ""quests"", or goals in the game is basically assassinations of important people. But to do that you need to gather information about them, so you do some different things to get this information. You beat people up, spy on people, pick peoples pockets, and more. Its mostly all of the same but the open environment makes the game far from linear. Every time you play the game again you can always try different tactics in different ways. The sound is perfect. The sword battles and crushing bones and slashing makes the combat more powerful. All the people around you are talking about what you're doing, they notice if you are climbing, hitting in to people, if you are drawing your weapon, leaving dead bodies behind e.t.c. Its a realistic feeling and you feel that whatever you do in the game matters. The voice acting is good. I do'nt remember the music so i cant tell. (I turn of the music when i play a game for a more realistic feeling but that's just me). To conclusion. This game is one of the best games i have played. I like games with high quality and this game fits my likings perfectly!			",289,87,6,51,22,2,44

												Assassin’s Creed is the first title of the popular Ubisoft Franchise, Assassin’s Creed. Launched in 2007, the game received enormous commercial success on consoles, but only a year later after its initial release, Assassin’s Creed was introduced to PC. Assassin’s Creed is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy lands of; Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus during the Crusades.Assassin’s Creed is a beautiful game, every crack and crevasse is filled with amazing detail, from astounding visuals to overheard cries for help. The graphics are absolutely jaw dropping, despite the age of the game. The Vast cities of Jerusalem and Acre extend into the horizon with hundreds of buildings and thousands of people living out their daily lives. All the while the frame-rate remains constant.The story, or should I story’s, brings the game to life. On the one hand, you play an assassin during the Third Crusade in 1191 AD, named Altair. We follow his quests as he assassinates nine public figures at the command of his master. And on the other hand, you are put into the shoes of Desmond Miles, whose ancestor was Altair. Desmond was taken in by a mysterious organization for questioning, and put into the Animus. The Animus is a device which allows the user to revisit their ancestors’ past memories. Desmond is forced to relive his ancestor’s life against his will for unknown reasons.The voice acting is solid throughout the game. Conversations are completely believable and delivered with the perfect amount of solemn dignity. What you hear in the game is more impressive than what you see. In the cities with populated areas, your ears will fill with the pleas of beggars, the din of street vendors, and the occasional humming. At the top of synchronisation points, you hear the wind blowing past you as you climb for the sky, the barking of a far-off dog, and the twittering of birds.Assassin’s Creed is exceptionally entertaining in that it features a mix of fine stealthy exploration and exciting combat. You start the game off fairly weak, but as you progress through missions, Altair gains new abilities and increased health. Before a primary target can be assassinated, you need to gather intelligence. The methods by which you go about doing so present the most irritating aspects of the game. When you get a mission to assassinate a target, you have to do at least 3 side quests first before you can assassinate the main target. There are an array of side quests that you can choose from, like; Pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interrogation, and target elimination. The problem is that after doing one of the side quests, there’s practically nothing satisfying about it.After completing three side quests of any variety, you head over to an assassin’s bureau in the city and you get informed that you can now assassinate your main target. The problem is that all the bits of intelligence you pick up while on side quests have little to no impact on how the eventual primary target mission plays out. Beyond that problem, after repeating the process for each target, things got plain, simple and just really boring.The controls, for me, could have been better. I often found myself getting stuck on a wall, roof top or the side of a building as you can’t just jump anywhere; you have to jump from one specific point to another. This really got on my nerves, especially when trying to run away from guards, the last thing you want to happen is to get stuck. Combat in the game is fun and exciting, but it does have its issues. First off, there are a few combinations that you will need time to get used to. Secondly, the character did not always do what I wanted him to. This did get a tad annoying sometimes but it’s not a major issue.The player is given five different weapons; long sword, short sword, throwing knives, and a hidden blade. Each weapon is useful in different situations. The long sword is the main tool of self-defence, and is useful for big battles; the short sword is a light and fast blade which is useful when facing small numbers of enemies; throwing knives can be very useful as they kill the enemy instantly, and you can use them for long distance kills; and the hidden blade which is used for assassinations.Assassin’s Creed does come with a few issues that just can’t be ignored. Firstly, the amount of guards that walk around the roof tops is incredible. It is impossible to go anywhere by running ‘freely’ on the roof tops without alerting a guard. You can assassinate them, but after a while, that satisfaction of watching Altair use his hidden blade to slam down a guard just becomes boring and you just want to get to where ever you going. So then you decide to take the city streets to your destination, only to find out that it’s just as annoying as taking the roof tops. The city streets in Assassin’s Creed are plagued with beggars, drunken people and woman carrying pots on their heads that fall and break if you run into them.If you are on a stealth mission where keeping your distance or blending in is needed, just wait until you come across the beggars who run in front of you, and you only, and start asking for money, meanwhile your target is getting away as once the beggar is in front of you it’s hard to get them out of the way. Same scenario, but you are confronted with drunken people who walk around and look like zombies from 'Land Of The Dead', if you get close to them they will push you which ultimately gives away your position and you have to restart the mission.The Verdict:Assassin’s Creed is definitely not the best game in the series, with its repetitive side quests and annoying NPCs, the game can get a bit frustrating and boring. For somebody totally unfamiliar with the game, it's certainly worth playing. Even though the game does have its faults, it still offers a great mix of exploration and action that is just waiting to be experienced.+ Good graphics + Lots to explore + Great story+ Challenging missions- No side Quests- Controls could have been better- To many guards on the roof tops- To many beggars and drunk people in the citiesSCORE: 7.5/10			",80,29,0,14,10,0,0

												Do not buy this game if you run anything newer than Vista or Win XP. I have a GTX980 running Win8.1x64 and the only thing I can 'enjoy' from this game is my screens flickering and saying 'Assassin's Creed has stopped working.' It won't even load. I'm no longer interested in playing this series, and will avoid buying any Ubisoft game, after having read so many others having problems just getting it to run, and about all the DRM insanity they put into this game. It seems when they were porting this from console to PC (another thing I'm remembering from this experience.. don't bother with a port unless its extremely well tested on PC) they were more concerned with people stealing it than having it run. Ubisoft, don't worry, I have no desire to steal this piece of garbage.

												- Does not work out of the box (the intro movie does not play). Requires manually setting ""Disable display scaling on high DPI settings"" at the compatibility settings, and requires launching the game .EXE manually.- Monochromatic. The entire game looks dull. Gray-ish and blue-ish. And dark, difficult to see sometimes.- Unskippable, long, boring cutscenes.- No ""Exit game"" in the in-game menus. Yes, requires Alt+F4.- Quantity over quality. Very repetitive. Very repetitive.- Long stretches of just walking from A to B, artificially increasing the game length.Overall: looks dull, the gameplay is repetitive, and is boring to play.

												This is a great game which I really enjoyed. The attention to detail and historical accuracy is excellent and you really feel that you are wandering around in the cities the story takes place in. I particularly liked the parts of the story that take place in Acre. However I agree with a lot people that the missions do get slightly repetitive towards the end causing the game to drag a bit at times hence me only giving it a score of 8. However it is a good intro to a very well done and fascinating series and a good hack and slash romp through a fascinating part of the Middle Ages			",178,10,17,31,25,1,96

												An oldie but a goodie, Assassin's Creed still holds up quite well in this day. The graphics don't look terrible, the gameplay is fun. The controls are a bit janky at times, and combat is pretty simple, but at the end of the day, it's a good game. Note: DO NOT GO FOR 100%. THOSE FLAGS GIVE YOU NOTHING.			",213,44,3,21,15,2,26

												Assassin's Creed is something of a classic, the beginning of one of the biggest series of all time. While the original AC had was a very fun game, it definitely had some flaws. It was a transitional game, trying to move the parkour of Prince of Persia into a world of stealth like Tenchu or Splinter Cell, and was definitely still growing through its awkward phase. The game feels very slow at times and pickpocketing missions are tedious to say the least. Some missions feel forced or don't make sense, and some of the stealth/alert mechanics really didn't work.  The combat is shockingly easy; counter kills all around!It's definitely worth playing for its gripping story and the combination of stealth and parkour action. It's a masterpiece in spite of its shortcomings. While the sequels have been getting progressively better, this is where it all started and is definitely worth a play through for fans of the series.			",206,24,0,50,8,1,22

												Summary:  --> Recommended+ Interesting action title. (Story / Action / Graphics / Killing )+ Casual playing, should completed around 30hrs of gameplay.+ Graphics is fine and smooth for me (even the game is 5-year old)+/-  Combat mode is personal, but I would say the control flows smooth (I use a controller) - Some repeat missions are frustrating to re-play.- Dead bodies may interrupt ongoing missions, which is extreamely annoying (solution is to re-start the game) Notes:-> I have spent a budget on the Assasin's Creed titles due to its positive repetation, in the Steam Summer Sale 2015 (carefully selected only PC sequels, not implents from other consoles)-> Price was around £3 (really worth it, but resonable)-> Steam reviews are fairly accurate to look into, in this series.-> Looking forward to the playing the 2nd title.--> ""Young man, you have done me a kindness. Be assured, I wont forget it)"" -The most annoying quote ever.			",31,1,0,0,2,0,4

												Let's be real for a second. In terms of story, it's pretty damn good. In terms of graphics, not to shabby. But in terms of gameplay, well..... Then it's pretty damn bad. Look I'm not saying this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because it's not. But I have to stress the fact that it has so many flaws like the other games in the franchise do (especially in the case of unity *cough*), but all it really is, is a repetetive game that makes you run everywhere and doing the same kind of short missions over and over. The small tasks you have to do just to get some information to progress the story (which you have to do over and over 9 times during the game's main storyline mind you), is so ♥♥♥♥ing lame. At least in the other ones there is more flexibility in terms of how you progress, and this adds a lot of variety to the overall gameplay. In this game however, you run around to the exact same places more than once, and the environments are boring and bland because the citizens have little to no emotion whatsoever other than running everywhere and screaming like chimpanzes high on meth with a splash of beer while driving a lambourgini backwards in a forest. When they see you running around they usually give you the same remarks again and again, like ""Oh stop your going to hurt someone!"", or there might be beggars who like to say ""Give me your ♥♥♥♥ing money."" which you don't have whatsoever. I mean why the hell would you go into a damn city populated by at least 100.000 npcs there, and not have some medicine or something. What about food? What about throwing knives? Why the hell do you have to get throwing knives from everyday thugs that are so damn indistinguishable from regular citizens? ♥♥♥♥, why is this game so god damn bland!?In short, I found this game to be incredibly boring, bland, stale, buggy, repetetive, and a whole lot of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ I like the parts of the story-line where you control Desmond better than the rest of this game, and no, I'm serious. Apart from the story which is pretty damn great, the rest of the game is so bland, so stale and boring, and I had an unpleasent expirience while playing. Only play this if your getting into the series. Although I will admit the hidden blade is pretty cool.			",66,12,1,10,2,0,4

												This game is the first in the large (and longed out) series of AC games, in retrospect this game is lacking next to the sequels in terms of voice acting, gameplay, graphics, interface, visually, storyline (although the storyline carries through the franchise).Ignoring this, the game on it's own is rather fun, but nothing too special. It's freerunning mixed with it's stealth and assassinations make it different to most other games and fun to play, especially as controlling these actions is rather fluid (though a bit dodgy at times).There are a few problems with this game that mainly include it's horribly boring cutscene style dialogs that go on for what feels like an eternity, and the game's horrible colouring, it may have been an artistic decision to make it so grey and dark and gloomy but it makes it feel depressing and look grim.9/15 - ""S'alright. Sequels are better.""			",246,34,6,26,27,2,18

												While I have heard a lot of ok reviews, and wanted to play this on PC, however, 2 hours later, multiple suggestions to fix it and restarts and disconnected the internet entirely, and I am still maybe 5 minutes of actual game time in with it still crashing. This game does not appear to be playable properly on a current PC, so if you have never played this before and especially if you are not overly tech savvy and want to just play the game, find a more recent title that does not have so many bugs.

												Let's be real for a second. In terms of story, it's pretty damn good. In terms of graphics, not to shabby. But in terms of gameplay, well..... Then it's pretty damn bad. Look I'm not saying this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because it's not. But I have to stress the fact that it has so many flaws like the other games in the franchise do (especially in the case of unity *cough*), but all it really is, is a repetetive game that makes you run everywhere and doing the same kind of short missions over and over. The small tasks you have to do just to get some information to progress the story (which you have to do over and over 9 times during the game's main storyline mind you), is so ♥♥♥♥ing lame. At least in the other ones there is more flexibility in terms of how you progress, and this adds a lot of variety to the overall gameplay. In this game however, you run around to the exact same places more than once, and the environments are boring and bland because the citizens have little to no emotion whatsoever other than running everywhere and screaming like chimpanzes high on meth with a splash of beer while driving a lambourgini backwards in a forest. When they see you running around they usually give you the same remarks again and again, like ""Oh stop your going to hurt someone!"", or there might be beggars who like to say ""Give me your ♥♥♥♥ing money."" which you don't have whatsoever. I mean why the hell would you go into a damn city populated by at least 100.000 npcs there, and not have some medicine or something. What about food? What about throwing knives? Why the hell do you have to get throwing knives from everyday thugs that are so damn indistinguishable from regular citizens? ♥♥♥♥, why is this game so god damn bland!?In short, I found this game to be incredibly boring, bland, stale, buggy, repetetive, and a whole lot of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ I like the parts of the story-line where you control Desmond better than the rest of this game, and no, I'm serious. Apart from the story which is pretty damn great, the rest of the game is so bland, so stale and boring, and I had an unpleasent expirience while playing. Only play this if your getting into the series. Although I will admit the hidden blade is pretty cool.			",66,12,1,10,2,0,4

												I think Assassin's Creed is such a weird franchise. It has so many cool things going for it, but then there's a whole heap of things that bring it down. I guess I would give it a Yes as a recommendation via Steam reviews, but from what I've played so far, my overall opinion on the series is more neutral.Anyway, this is the first game in the franchise, and there are some really interesting things about it. No other game has really done free running so openly like Assassin's Creed, or approached history with such a expansive and imaginative point of view. The time period is very unique and well realized. The simple mechanics (some of which are okay, and others which unfortunately are not well polished) are also surprisingly welcome, because for someone like me, the combat and gameplay isn't exactly what draws me in, it's the world and history, so I don't want to waste my time learning some complex systems. I think the problems lie with the combat and movement which are extremely hit-or-miss and the storytelling. Having most of the cutscenes take place from a static third person perspective is really off putting, and gives a really poor B-movie vibe for any story that is present. As well, the whole modern timeline thing is just ridiculuous. This game (and the series as a whole) needs to do without it. Especially considering there are zero likeable characters (in my opinion) in the modern timeline. I just don't care about any of them. Overall, I'd probably give this game like a 6.5/10. I think it's a really decent game, and it's definitely worth a look, but grab it on sale.			",110,27,2,7,1,0,5

												Because this is the first game in the series, I had to play it. It is really nice, the graphics are okay and the story makes you wonder what comes next. There is one thing I didn't like though. If you're running a slow computer, you have to start the game through opening the folder it was installed in, and navigate to one of the dxs of the game. There is no standard ubisoft information about it anywere which is really bad. And then it doesn't even show the playtime! My 1.8 hours on record is the time facing blackscreens and freezes trying to start the game.			",142,10,3,12,12,0,15

												This is one of the glitchiest ports I've ever played. Within the first 3 missions, I experienced the following: unable to complete the wall-climb in Solomon's Temple because my character bugged out on the first hand-hold and would not respond to any keyboard/mouse or controller input (had to restart the mission), characters flying out of the world during the assault on Masyaf (3 separate times within 5 minutes), camera glitching around wildly during present time sequences (without any input), and my character bugged out during a leap of faith and died and now whenever it reloads, I fall out of the world and die over and over again. I had to start a new game in order to fix this.Not to mention that it's a 5-step process to exit the game, which is ridiculous. You have to exit out of a mission to the animus in the present day, then exit the animus, then choose to exit to the menu, and then you have to load a profile before you can actually choose to exit. This should be 2 steps at most - quit to menu, select exit.			",72,6,1,9,30,0,12

												This is the game that started my assassin’s obsession. Even though I bought it recently on Steam, it has my ~10 full walkthroughs (5 of them with flags, templars, citizens and viewpoints accomplished), a lot of memory block replays.I played it first within a week of its release (not knowing it), and up until now, the game fascinated me several times:When I bought the game, I expected something similar to Prince of Persia (huge fan at that moment and up till now), but the freedom just dazzled me. Social interactions, different weapons... Unfortunately, at that time my computer was too weak, so I was forced to relieve Tamir’s assassination for nearly forty times (several tries every day for two weeks, hoping to get to bureau before it crashes).Then I just happened to remember that the game has graphic options. Setting everything to minimum, I managed to play through the game – the dialogues, different approaches, progression, plot twists – all was everything and fresh at moment.After upgrading the computer I finally could see the beauty of landscapes and cities – every setting was maxed. Even today graphics of static objects (buildings, rocks, landscapes) is up to the competition with today’s games.Finally, I purchased the game in English, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear huge work implemented in the game – all the accents and voicework made i worthwhile.So, I recommend the game despite its sometimes repetitive gameplay (please name the game where gameplay isn’t the same throughout the game).

												Excellent story driven game. However, it is console port, not as bad as assassin's creed 2 where screen does not even display keyboard keys, assuming i know all the hotkeys, but its something you can get use to. Side missions are repetitive, same objectives with different locations, it is optional but it gives more play time. AI is dumb and annoying. Other than that it is really good story, it outweighs all the cons. Game has no replay ability except collecting flags. Only bug i have encounter is game crashes sometimes, but i was recording so that might be the problem. Big plus is no Ubisoft drm :)			",162,42,3,31,25,2,23

												This game was like a dream come true for me. A lot of people complain about it being repetitive, shallow, boring, etc. and I can understand how they can say that. However I really enjoyed the freedom of movement and beautiful scenery. It's like you're a Middle Ages Batman! With time travel! I would've picked up the sequel on launch day if it wasn't for the overbearing DRM.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												Smart stealth mechanics, given a varity of weapons to dispatch your foes and wear a cool hood. As the name suggests you play as an assassin in the time setting of the Third Crusade -1191. His name is Altaïr an ex-master assassin which has to relearn what it means to be an assassin and along the way uncover the secrets behind the Templar Order, ancient enemies to the Secret Order of Assassins ""The Creed"". Slowly through out the game you get to use different weapons and get more familar with your parkour skills as you smoothly end any foe and explore the many areas and cities in the Holy Land in this era.Though some activities and missions are repetitive like racing, escorting, etc but they do get harder to do.One of the best games with an original story and unique game mechanics, this is one game you would love to play.

												So, you'll probably notice that my gameplay time isn't that high, and, well, I have a good reason for that. The gameplay. In my opinion, this game had one of the worst types of gameplay I've ever come across, so this kind of forced me to try and get through the game as fast as I could. The fighting was very bland, the missions were VERY repetetive, and to be honest, I didn't enjoy any of the fights. There's also the fact that there were no subtitles, which is a must-have for me, very limited soundtrack, Altair spoke in an American accent in a time where America didn't even exist (Yes, I'm aware that they change his voice in Revelations, although I haven't played it yet.) and it was far too easy to escape the guards. One of the things I really did enjoy, though, is the storyline, especially the bits with the one-armed assassin. I'd recommend this to anyone who can stomache bad gameplay for a good story, but otherwise, I don't feel like this game deserves a recommendation. Unless, of course, you're planning on understanding the whole series' story.			",136,5,0,26,2,0,4

												Boring gameplay consisting of repeating the same actions over and over. Several technical issues:- not recognizing xbox 360 controller correctly- problems with playing intro movies- no possibility to skip intro and dialogues in the game- game freezing- in some fights you cannot see enemies due to weird view angles where something is obscuring the view- only reasonable way to exit the game is Alt + F4, otherwise you will have to exit to main menu (actually you have to do that twice in different menus), select and load your profile and only then you have the possibility to really close the game (!).This game is a waste of time, terribly overrated.

												This game is the most repetitive piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever played. There is nothing like doing the same things over and over again in 3 different cities. The game consists of: Go to Acre/Jerusalem/Damascus, get the scoop on who you are supposed to kill, get all the viewpoints in the district you are exploring, do 3 of the 6 missions associated with gaining info on your target, grab a feather from your feather friend, kill the target, bathe the feather in the blood of your target, give the bloody feather to your feather friend, return to home base and get an earful from your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss. You do this over and over and over, until the very end when you actually do something else for once. Every now and then you go back to present day as Desmond Miles, the person in the animus controlling the main character Altair, but nothing really ever happens.Also all of the characters are pretty trash, Altair apparently starts an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and becomes a good person at the end but I honestly couldn't tell because I did not care. The present day timeline with Desmond is also basically irrelevant since all it is is finding out that Templars still exist.All in all, the only reason you should buy this game is because you want the very little back story it holds before you play Assassins Creed II, or you have already played most if not all of the series and want to go back to its roots. It's a 3/10 from me.			",305,67,4,28,30,5,47

												Assassin’s Creed is an undeniably ambitious game. Attempting to follow in the storied tradition of greats such as chocolate and peanut butter, it wants to be a bunch of awesome things made even more awesome by way of combination—specifically, equal parts tense stealth game, badass fighting game, and open-world sandbox game rolled into one. It even wants to deliver a complicated plot that will keep you guessing to the very end. The result is sort of like dumping your chocolate and peanut butter into a bowl of ice cream along with every other item from the make-your-own-sundae bar. The mixture as a whole is a little odd, but once you learn to identify the things you like and pick around the things you don’t there are some incredible taste sensations to be had.Despite taking place during the Third Crusade in the embattled Holy Land surrounding Jerusalem, Assassin’s Creed barely touches upon religious issues and instead focuses more on general issues of power over society. You play an assassin named Altair (pronounced Al-Taa-Ir) who is tasked with the killing of nine influential men—including both Christians and Muslims—towards the greater goal of restoring order to the land and bringing justice to the people. There is also another element to the story, a sci-fi bit that may not be to some people’s liking. Although it does permeate the HUD and other parts of the graphical interface it only surfaces directly as very brief interludes a few times during the game, and the story as a whole remains interesting enough to drive the action forward.That action revolves around the nine assassinations, and each one follows the same basic formula. You go to the city district your current target resides in (three districts in each of three cities), find out where and what your target is up to, and then take him out. There are investigation mini-games—eavesdropping, pick-pocketing, interrogation, and other forms of information gathering—which you must completed to move on, as well as lookout points to climb and citizens to rescue from the guards, optional tasks encouraged by the increase to your maximum health and additional means of escape from the guards they grant. The assassinations themselves often come down to a scripted sequence followed by a brief stalking or a brawl and a large dose of the plot. Though not entirely unsatisfying, those hoping for more of a Hitman-esque arena to set up your own style of assassination will be disappointed.To accomplish all this you’ll rely on Altair’s three rather impressive skills sets—fighting, sneaking, and acrobatics. Fighting, while it looks amazing with tons of cinematic flourishes and gruesome finishing moves, basically comes down to a one-button timing game. Repeatedly press the attack button with the right timing and you’ll score a kill. Likewise, the proper timing on that same button while blocking will score you a counter strike, either sending your foe sprawling or killing him outright. Mess it up and you’re likely to take some damage. There are a few other wrinkles, but that’s pretty much it. Your enemies always have swords, and come in maybe three or four different difficulties, but once you master the system no number of enemies is ever really hard again.When you don’t feel like fighting, or in rare instances when it’s actually required, Altair’s stealth abilities come in handy. Assassin’s Creed doesn’t use typical stealth mechanics though, but rather the concept of hiding as its mainstay. When the guards aren’t alerted, you can hide in plain sight, by moving slowly and blending into crowds. In this state you can assassinate even the toughest enemies in the game with a strike from your hidden blade. Once the charade is up though, you’ll have to run to one of many pre-set hiding points—piles of hay, small cloth-draped gazebos, etc.—or kill all the guards chasing you before you can go back to being sneaky again. It’s a little hokey, but it more or less functions as intended, leading to some tense moments and harrowing chases.One of the real highlights of Assassin’s Creed is Altair’s incredible acrobatic abilities. Taking a page from the Price of Persia’s playbook, Altair is a master of all things running and jumping. Anything and everything is a potential hand or foot hold, and scaling city structures using the seamless controls is not only a joy but one that nets very tangible strategic rewards. It also gives you an opportunity, particularly when climbing the many lookout points, to gape in awe at exactly how beautiful Assassin’s Creed is, arguably featuring the best art direction ever in a game. The cities and surrounding landscape are fantastically presented, and the panoramic views from high above are truly breathtaking.Through the first third of the game, which amounts to a greatly extended tutorial, you are shown all of these wonderful things you can do. What happens after that is a very subtle escalation of the difficulty that continues through the rest of the game. Hacking through guards too easy? How about larger and larger groups then, with better countering abilities and trickier timings? Sneaking around too easy? Try getting past more guards on higher alert who will spot you if you’re careless. Likewise, later city districts have trickier buildings to climb, with more archers positioned on the roofs. It’s a very clever and refined way to make a game, but the subtlety is at times too slight, and there is a great repetition of the same basic elements for most of the game with little in the way of overt addition.Incredibly stylish and undeniably unique, Assassin’s Creed’s particular choices in combining all these gameplay elements will be debated by supporters and critics alike for a long time. If it all sounds like too much to realistically fit into one game, at least in this case it is, but not by as wide a margin as you might imagine. The result, while not quite all it could have been, is definitely more than the sum of its parts. While Assassin’s Creed doesn’t manage to deliver a top notch experience in any one of these areas individually, it gets enough things right in all of them and gives you a lot of freedom in how to use them, all while looking pretty damn cool. Though it degenerates into a lot of fighting at the end, and makes a fair number of mistakes in its execution along the way, there’s something entrancing about this game and each of the amazing things you can do. Your mileage may vary on precisely how quickly the game’s repetition exceeds its subtle nuance, but it’s well worth checking out for the first times if not for the seventy thirds.Highly recommended ",1534,600,45,244,159,15,219

												Short verdict: it's not a stealth game, it's a poorly executed and repetitive horde mode with lousy battle system and mediocre story.My overall rating: 6/10.Story: it's fine, somewhat dull and lacks detail that later titles have, but in overall it's fine.Graphics: surprisingly well for such an old game.Battlesystem: attack, strong attack, a block, a counter, evasion, a grab and a grab brake - it all fused into frustrating♥♥♥♥♥♥of your patience, because there's no way how to finish battle more quickly (except for knife throw/stealth kill - with very limited opportunities), you are forced to go through the same repetitive choreography all over again. And with hordes of enemies on every corner, it's really a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Gameplay: basically, it's the same pattern throughout the game: find the assassins' bureau, perform at least minimum number of investigations, kill the primary target, report of success. What changes is the city/city district and number of soldiers in the cities. By the end of the game, the numbers are overwhelming. There's really no way how you stay incognito, unless you are tiptoing through vast quarters full of beggars, thugs and crazy people, that all stand in your way to perform missions. What I hated the most was that there's really no way you could STEALTH kill the targets, because they were surrounded by number of guards. And that number was increasing with each next target. It felt more like hack'n'slash at some points.Side missions: climb points of view - reveals the location of assassins' bureaus and other side missions;save citizens - reduces number of soldiers and unlock vigilantes that might help you escape (it's not that much of a help actually);investigations: eavesdropping, pickpocketing, intimidation missions, escort challenges, killing archers/pursuers for fellow assassins, flag challenges/catching informers on time;collectibles: flags (a set for each city/territory).With every completed set of 15 objectives, you are granted additional health unit, but after you're maxed out, there's no point to bother with side missions, because they're all the same and do not provide any substantial reward.I have previously played AC3 and I think it's a wonderful game. I've spent 116 hours on it. It gave me a genuine sense of historic atmosphere and it really felt like a stealth game. Intrigued by AC saga and heroes, I looked forward for similar experience with the original title. However, what I found was frustration and disappointment. I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't. It's not a pleasant pastime, it's a trial of patience, which, I guess, I have, because I've actually finished the game. But it was not a fun ride, you would expect from such a popular title.The only way and reason I find this game worth anyone's time and money is with discount and to find out how the whole AC saga began.p.s. There's is one great thing about it, though. It does not have uPlay overlay.			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												Assassin's Creed:Compared to Assassin's Creed II, this game is unexciting and bland. It's really disappointing as the first entry for the series.Positives:+ Having completed Assassin's Creed II and subsequent games in the series, I can say the whole plot behind the Assassin's Creed franchise is great and well designed.+ Various weapons and fighting styles, use hidden blades and swords to strike down foes. + Free climbing and running, you can scale walls and buildings. A lot of the environment can be interacted with. Negatives:- Constant crashing on the latest GPU's, GTX 970 4 GB (2015), to the point of being unplayable.- The game world seemed really dull during my brief playthrough. It's quite bleak and lacks a lot of colour. The controls were also an abomination.- Graphically it's nothing fantastic. Even during release it was arguably poor graphics for its time.- For a game about assassination it's surprisingly lacklustre when it comes to the act itself. It's not really a stealth game, there aren't many creative ways to carry out assassinations...it's just odd. Assassin's Creed II struggled with this as well, but it was far more fun and interesting, so I can forgive it.- Constant repetition with menial tasks, like eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing. Boring.- Pause interface is obstructive and annoying.Overall Score 4/10In my experience the games in the Assassin's Creed series are decent but have never had that 'wow' factor. Assassin's Creed is probably the worst, and well worth skipping. Starting with Assassin's Creed II is your best bet. You won't miss out on much of the vital story anyway, and you'll save yourself from this painful game.It's definitely not good, or anywhere close, but it's not horrific at the same time. It's just ehh..very, very bad.			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												I did play the first AC after I had finished AC3. I do not necessarily recommend it to people who have played the later installments. Anyone who hasn't played any AC game yet will do better with it's sequels because this original AC still lacked much. I did play it because I was curious to see how the series, Altaïr's story and the story about ""Those Who Came Before"" started and was fairly disappointed.The cities and rural areas are fairly nice to look at and ride through. However they all look and feel sort of the same, both weather and the daytime are static (the whole game plays at sunny daytime). Perhaps one can see more in it if he knows Damascus, Israel and the other cities you visit in this game, though I assume they have changed a lot over the centuries. Monumental places and buildings are not ""commented"" by the Animus system whatsoever, which makes it hard for people who don't know these cities to connect to them and to their history. You do not buy places, build your own ""home"" or interact with the cities in any bigger scale either (there isn't any money or economy to begin with). There is some awe-inspiring feeling to the whole of Maysaf being the center of the Assassin order, and both Altaïr and his mentor have a feeling of serious- and meaningfulness you may miss within the later installments. But even then their outlines are fairly weak; after having finished this game I could hardly understand what the fuss about Altaïr was about for people to apparently miss him so much when Ezio became the new protagonist in AC2. Altaïr didn't feel as special as I had believed he was, hell you will probably dislike him because he is an arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ throughout most parts of the game.The true letdown is the gameplay. The combat is underdeveloped compared to the sequels (you cannot strike down enemies  with assassination streaks as they were introduced with Brotherhood, you don't have as many weapons - it didn't feel as enjoyable) and the progression throughout the game is pretty repetitive. This original game is probably most faithful to the idea of being an assassin as you are constantly tasked to kill some templars hiding in the cities, often wealthy or well-protected people you need to ""locate"" first by doing minor tasks that in the later installments would pass for ""side activities"" at best: Eavesdrop one some guys, beat up/question another, pickpocket some intel from someone else and the likes. There are about 5 of these tasks to do per kill target, you choose which to do and need to finish about 3 of them to be able to ""locate"", approach and strike your kill target (which thankfully have some background, and are approached in a bit more interesting way than your previous tasks). After that you go back to Maysaf, speak to your mentor and go for a new target. Rinse and repeat. And that's already about it mostly. There are activities having the nature of ""collectibles"", like killing templars hiding in specific locations in the cities and rural areas, or saving citiziens from repressive soldiers, but those activites are very repetitive too. They didn't really motivate me much to roam about more than I had to. There are some unique story/plot moments, but they are rare.Also, this game had an usability issue: It doesn't have subtitles. It may seem stupid, but apparently it wasn't self-evident back then. For a game trying to take serious steps in storytelling and bringing some past time to life it would help to understand all the people. I think they all speak English in this game (in the later games the citizens partly speak in their native language), but I still can't understand them all because English isn't my main tongue. There are some whisperings of story-relevant characters in parts of the game - don't expect me to get any of their lines too well either.			",540,267,8,78,53,4,61

												The first of one of the best known series from this era. The tale of the Third Crusade and the Assassin's brotherhood is rich in details, historical facts and characters, and both the science fiction and history are well balanced. The graphics are impressive, especially in the environment design and art: each building, street and structure is rich in details. The gameplay is intuitive and the sensation of freedom running over the roofs or climbing to a tall tower and looking at the whole city below is just impressive. The game is full of bugs, giving the sensation that it was released before it should, but I didn't find any that really affected gameplay. Assassin's Creed do have a Achilles heel, and it is the level design: you just do the same kind of sub-mission over and over until you have enough to kill your target, the really interesting part of the game. Asides this only major flow, is a great game that everyone should try.			",1865,710,79,230,238,18,346

												Its really too bad that there isn't an inbetween, otherwise my reccomendation would be ""eh"", rather than yes or no.Game:The game is VERY repetitive. Throughout the entire game, each mission is pretty much the same. - Travel to a city, where one of your targets are- Talk to Assassin at bureau- Complete 3 side activities (investigations) before you can take out your target- Report back to Assassin at bureau- Take out your target- Run away and escape from guards- Return to Assassin at bureau one last time to report success- Return home to report of your success to Master- Repeat (x9)You have 9 targets total throughout the game, which means you do the SAME thing 9 times before the ending of the game.It got to a point where I wasn't really playing for fun anymore, I was playing just to beat the game. Nothing is really exciting about the game until the ending.Story:There is a major lack of story and personality with all the characters. You establish connections with NO ONE, because of all the missions being the same and there being a lack of build up or story behind those you are targeting.No one is rememorable, except Warren, who I think had the MOST personality, and Altair of course, and even he lacks much of a personality, though he has more personality than anyone else in the game, except Warren.People complain about Assassins like Connor lacking any personailty while Altair has almost NONE at all!The little personality I got from Altair was; determined, focused, arrogant, and confused.I suppose a better way of putting it was that he had lots of potential but what is given is performed horribly.In later games there is story behind everyone you take out. They wronged you, they serve a big role in the Templars, they have information, etc.In this game, you get no story at all about anyone really, until the ending.Gameplay:The combat isn't that good, with it being to just spam one button and hope whoever you're fighting doesn't reverse you randomly.In later games combat is a little more fleshed out, with there being certain ways to fight certain enemies that make it more diverse, but here its the same fighting style over and over again, which adds to the repetitiveness of this game.There isn't a diversity in enemies either, they're all the same, unless you want to count archers and swordsmen as 2 different enemies, but they fight the same.Also I love (sarcasm) how when a sick guy pushes ME, it makes ME the criminal!Bugs:This game is a buggy mess. Nothing that is exactly game breaking, but constantly the viewmodel would break sometimes after being knocked down by an enemy, sometimes while doing a leap of faith I would die on TOP of the hay stack, sometimes bodies would fall out of the map through the ground, some guards would remain idle while I am attacking other guards RIGHT NEXT to him, etc.Again, nothing game breaking, but broke immersion quite often.Overall rating: 4/10You'd be better off just getting any of the other Assassins Creed games. This game feels like some sort of early Alpha compared to its sequel.If you passed this game up, you wouldn't miss much. You'd be better off starting your Assassins Creed experience with Assassins Creed 2, and just looking up what little you missed in Assassins Creed 1.			",237,34,0,17,16,1,18

												Im sorry, I just plain cant play through this. The Assassins Creed series is an amazing Franchise barring Unity, but this product feels like an unfinished mess.I was told I should play through this one through my replay of the series to fill myself in on the extra details of the story, because apparently Revelations makes more sense when you do that. The thing is, the game is downright unbearable. At one poing during a pickpocket sequence in Damascus, the game bugged out and didnt register I had to pick pocket anyone. I held shift and I simply continued to brush people aside, constantly getting caught. With fundamental bugs like this, Ill watch a playthrough or look it up if I feel inclined to see the entirety of this game's story.Please start with the second game if you want to delve into this series.

												From the old days, when Ubisoft isn't EA. Comes a game inspired from The Prince of Persia, that spawn a way better franchise than Prince of Persia. Assassin's Creed.You probably already played the sequels, so now play the game that start it all. Where you will get totally dissapointed and bored if you already play the rest of the franchise. Play as Desmond Miles, a bartender who's actually have the most awesome family tree ever. Who was kidnapped by an evil company, like Ubisoft now, where he's forced to use a machine to play a game about his great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather, Altair, a Syrian assassin that spoke like he's from The United States. So with the Animus, you will journey to 1191 Syrian, where you ride along in Altair's quest to kill a few templars. How? By doing the same old side mission like, Listening to people talking, Pickpocketing, Collecting Flags, and Being hired as a bodyguard. When you're finished, you can kill those templars with your limited set of weapons like swords, hidden blades, throwing knives, and nothing else.So, if you think Assassin's Creed Unity was bad, Black Flag is boring, AC3 is dull, and The Ezio Trilogy is awesome, this game is well pretty much worse than the others.Starring :Syrian Desmond, Assassin Saruman, Lex Luthor, One handed Bass, The 7 deadly templars, and nothing else.Assassin's Creed 1			",37,0,0,3,2,0,0

My xbox 360 controller did not end up working at first and I had to tweak around to get it to work, the tutorial kept freezing constantly and I could not get anywhere and it is so damn glitchy. It's honestly a glitch fest! I am refunding it! Altair was spinning in circles like a glitchy ball during the tutorial and I do not want to risk anything. It's $6.79 on sale but this should be $2-3 since it's been out for almost 10 years! I rather save my money and get something optimized!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story and concept is wonderful. New and exciting.Unfortunately, that is where it ends. if you manage to slog your way through the extremely long and boring introduction, that is plagued by extremely confusing control schemes that are constantly changing, a headache inducing visual affect to tryin and give the impression of ""being in a computer"", that just drags. it's not even a couple minutes. Prepare to spend 15 minutes on the tutorial (unskippable) before even starting the introduction, which slags on nor another hour or so of more tutorials. Even if you manage to get past this part, you quickly realize that the game is going to be excessively long as you are forced to repeat the same gameplay over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over again.Here's a tip: don't buy this game. Go read the story online. the story is great. the game is not. I've been told at least that Assasin's Creed 2 is much better game and is actually amazingly fun...after about 6 hours of gameplay, I'm stopping playing this one and will jump forward in the series in hope for redeption. This game has not aged well, despite being only 5ish years old ",72,12,0,10,6,0,5

												I started off by playing Assassin's Creed 2, staring Ezio Auditore. Safe to say when I went back to play the original Assassin's Creed, while I was impressed with the story line I was anything but with the actual game play. Objectives weren't clear, game controls were signifcantly different to the subsequent AC games, and certain aspects of the game simply didn't make sense like why the guards were constantly on high alert even though they have no idea what you look like and so have to shift around the game slowly while in the prescence of guards. Something which also annoyed me was that our little protagonist can drown.... A (soon to be) Master Assassin can drown. Kind of takes away the magic.I found myself getting bored within 3 hours of game play and I have no drive to complete this game whatsoever. I regret buying this on the summer sale 2016, and I instead wish I had purchased Assassin's Creed Revelations so I could at least finish Ezio's story.Just avoid it.			",21,2,1,2,1,0,0

[X360 controller])- r*tarded fighting system- stupid, repetitive side-quests- assassinations in daylight in front of all the people?!- f*cking beggars (Please, sir, can I have your money? - that is nice mataphor, beggars are the creators of this game)- you can't skip cutscenes, you have to listen to this whole BS after every assassination- ridiculous plot- frustrating things like: 1. riding on a horse - you can ride, but only slowly, if you ride fast you HAVE TO BE AN ASSASSIN, LET'S PURSUE HIM AND LET'S CONNECT MINDS WITH ALL OTHER GUARDS AND TELL THEM THAT THIS MAN RIDES HIS HORSE TOO FAST2. exiting a game - how can you f*ck up such simple thing? that's a masterpiece in AC - to quit a game you have to:I. Press start and choose ""Exit memory"" (loading screen...)II. Press Exit Animus (animation of dude getting up from the animus...)III. Press start and choose ""Quit game"" (loading screen...)IV. Press any keyV. Select profile (SERIOUSLY?!)VI. Press Exit game3. No stealth system in games about assassins4. Kill, run from million guards, repeat5. Assassin gets the target of assassinasion, then gathers informations about him, then asks in bureau if that's enough (how did they pick the target previously? randomly?)			",155,45,1,37,5,3,15

												Assassin's Creed......It's really hard to say about the sheer size and brilliance of Assassin's Creed into words. It is an epic game that you have to experience for yourself. The cities of the Holy Land have been nicely rendered. The people, the environment & landscape has been designed so briliantly that it gives an uncanny feeling which cannot be descibed with words. Although the game-play & becomes repetative after a while, but it is truly an incredible experience. I will definitely recommend this game :)			",116,11,4,6,3,0,2

												The game that started it all, it has actually aged fairly well.  Even though newer games are prettier and better and have better storytelling and less repetitive gameplay, I still recommend to go ahead and start from the beginning.  The settings are still pretty, and the gameplay is still fun, if a bit repetitive by the time you get to the end of it (you might skip a few of the optional collections which is just fine).  The storyline of these games are direct sequels of each other, so I definitely recommend starting with this one before moving on to others in this great series.  If you skip most of the optional collecting, the game should only take a few hours to beat.Controller support is enabled but for some reason the default keys seem to not match up correctly.  Especially if you have played later games in the series, be sure to remap the controls before playing or you'll get a little turned around.			",95,11,2,5,2,0,1

												I only recommend this game if you have an interest in playing all the games through, because on its own this is a pretty terrible game. The quests are repetitive, glitches are numerous, combat is worse than Arkham Asylum's, and the story has some cool twists but is altogether predictable. The voice acting is also horrendous, something that doesn't seem to improve for a few Assassins Creed games, and nothing takes you out of a game faster than bad voice actors.But being a decently-original game idea when it was released and probably the best of its time, it's hard to argue that playing it isn't worth it especially if you're interested in the series. The graphics also hold up pretty well to today, and in some instances I believe the graphics are better than in Assassins Creed II, but besides that it's a ~18 hour journey (or shorter if it doesn't keep crashing) that's worth it for Assassins Creed fans.

												The game feels more like an extended tech demo than an actual game. The missions are repetitive, and most of the side ones -- chasing flags, timed deliveries -- make very little sense in the context of the story, which isn't bad, but not exactly great, either. It's still a reasonably fun and well-executed game. Like all AC games, it's good times for a history buff, but you should still only pick up this game if you're interested in seeing how the overarching story of the series unfolds in its entirety -- the following titles may be somewhat difficult to follow without knowing what happened in this one.

												The first Assassin's Creed is by far THE BEST in the series, followed shortly by Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, which brought a lot of replayability and multiplayer community fun to the table.In this game, hear hear, you ACTUALLY ASSASSINATE PEOPLE.You literally go from town to town, get information on your victim, get a permission from the assassins to go on your assassinations, like ASSASSINS DO I KNOW RIGHT SO SHOCKING, and then you KILL THE GUY. AND HE TELLS YOU STUFF WHILE ON THE GROUND, BEFORE DYING, LIKE PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY GET ASSASSINATED.And you're actually HOLDING him on the ground, whispering the discussion, not walking around screaming while he's on the ground bleeding *COUGH COUGH  COUGH COUGH*WOW SUCH SHOCK.And the story is an actual story that makes sense, has depth to it and makes you try and understand what's going on, question your morals, make you learn lessons that are valuably taught by Al Mualim (your master in game) and overall leave you with a ""Woooooahhhhh"" every 3 seconds. An amazing experience.But Galex, you might say, I WANNA BUY A BANK LOLWELL MY FRIEND, GO BUY A FREAKING BANK SIMULATOR, THIS IS      ASSASSIN'S         CREED. EMPHASIS ON ASSASSIN'S.TL; DR The only game in the series where you're actually assassinating people while on a mission from an assassin organization, no BUYING BANKS, no RANDOM SIDE MISSIONS ABOUT WHATEVER, an AMAZING story and an amazing concept that got finally one up'd only by AC IV. A must play.			",48,4,0,1,2,0,1

												While I can't deny that this game is a groundbreaking one, I can't help but feel this one is very lackluster when compared to its sequels. While that is to be expected in any game series (or at least most game series), I just could not find replay value in this one after I beat it once. But like I stated previously, I cannot deny the fact that without this game its sequels never would have been produced so I cannot help but have total respect for this game. All in all, it has a good story (although static camera angles for long periods of time makes it difficult to commit to it), but unrefined gameplay. If you want to get into Assassin's Creed, definately start with this one because it is a good steppingstone to the future games and also provides a good deal of story that is used throughout the series, but if you are looking back from Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and wondering if this one is worth replaying, just be wary and know that (gameplay-wise), this game is far less refined.

Yes, the missions get extremely repetitive and the story in this game is utter trash 95% of the time, but it's still a unique and enjoyable game that is a good way to ease yourself into the sprawling franchise. This is the only game in the series that is actually tough at times, but if you can get past it... I guess it's a bit self-rewarding...			",209,73,3,20,18,3,14

Im looking forward to playing the sequels and hope that they can provide extra tangents to this open story and have some mor fun and interesting tasks to accomplish in more diverse locations.

												Assassin's Creed Review:11 hrs completion time5/10With a weak and predictable storyline mediocre graphics, repetetive side objectives and repetition of missions it was a bland experience that I struggled to get through. Coupled with the problems in the fighting system such as not being able to block properly as the game chooses when it wants to block plus ""free run"" mechanics randomly choosing also where to jump randomly I have jumped straight through buildings into a haystack instead of climbing.With no real variations in cities apart from cultures shifting from Arabic to European the objectives and citizens stayed all the same with only changes to clothing but voice work remained the same.

												I have no idea how a potentially great game could be made so annoying and frustrating.It all started with traveling to the cities for the first time. Since you've never been there you don't have fast travel. It was really boring riding there especially when guards came by and I had to walk slowly, taking a lot of time for nothing.At the cities as I got deeper into the game was when I realized how flawed and annoying this game could be.Most of the time Altair never jumps where I want him to, even if I point my controller at the exact position. This can be really annoying when accidentally falling down or trying to escape guards.Another very annoying thing is the distracting citizens. The beggers, the drunk fist fighters, the people who just push you for no reason. I fail to understand why this content got into the game for any other reason but to annoy the player. You can't really make a stratigical move to avoid them since they are at random places and/or follow you around.The gameplay becomes very repetitive once you got your first assassination, it's just climbing towers to find mini-missions, completing them and going for the big kill, which would be the only fun part of the game if all the careful planning, taking care of rooftop archers and finding a good escape route would not be ruined by a drunk guy randomly pushing me into my target or a guard.Probably the most annoying thing is the people of the cities speaking the same things over and over again. The high score for me was a guard harassing a guy saying ""You dare steal in my presence? That will cost you your life!"" six times over and over again.Without all the annoying content the repetitive gameplay would not be so bad since the story seems great so far and the great (but currently buggy) engine of the game would compensate for the boring submissions.tl;dr: one of the most annoying games I've ever played and all it would take to fix it is a patch			",143,23,2,23,17,3,13

												If you love spending hours upon hours of doing nothing but the same thing over and over again, then I highly recommend this game. If you value your time more than an unemployed-by-choice middle aged man living at home with his parents, then look elsewhere for entertainment. This game consists of extremely bad AI, a rather dull, very slow and predictable moving story line (I would have enjoyed a novel based on this. But a game was not needed). It's just one of those games where the concept is good, but the execution leaves much to be desired.			",217,67,6,31,17,1,42

												This is the story about some guy who is kidnapped by someone else and forced to use the mumble to mumble mumble the memories of mumblemurf for some reason or other. The game doesn't have subtitles. An unfortunate design choice for two reasons.The first reason: Many of the actors(?) haven't quite figured out how to open their mouth while talking.The second reason: talking is pretty much everything that happens in this game.Don't believe the lie about open-world gameplay, parkour moves and total freedom. All I seemed to do in this game was to hold forwards from one dialogue-ridden cutscene to the next. Sure, I had the option of parkouring about the place, but it didn't bring forth feelings of open world movement and pulse-pounding action. Freerunning simply felt like a carrot being dangled over my nose on the other side of a window, designed solely to frustrate me while I wait through another cutscene.Wait seems to be the keyword in this game. The intro in particular is an irritating wait. Intros are to be skipped. We see them the first time, and then we skip past them because we've already seen them. But no. The developers don't care about me wanting to play a game, they've got religious nutters to placate, leaving me to tap the escape-button with no real hope of being let into the game any time soon.Still, if you've got good hearing, a high tolerance for tricky control schemes, and a genuine interest in Mumblemurf's backstory, I'm sure the game is good.

												I have no idea how a potentially great game could be made so annoying and frustrating.It all started with traveling to the cities for the first time. Since you've never been there you don't have fast travel. It was really boring riding there especially when guards came by and I had to walk slowly, taking a lot of time for nothing.At the cities as I got deeper into the game was when I realized how flawed and annoying this game could be.Most of the time Altair never jumps where I want him to, even if I point my controller at the exact position. This can be really annoying when accidentally falling down or trying to escape guards.Another very annoying thing is the distracting citizens. The beggers, the drunk fist fighters, the people who just push you for no reason. I fail to understand why this content got into the game for any other reason but to annoy the player. You can't really make a stratigical move to avoid them since they are at random places and/or follow you around.The gameplay becomes very repetitive once you got your first assassination, it's just climbing towers to find mini-missions, completing them and going for the big kill, which would be the only fun part of the game if all the careful planning, taking care of rooftop archers and finding a good escape route would not be ruined by a drunk guy randomly pushing me into my target or a guard.Probably the most annoying thing is the people of the cities speaking the same things over and over again. The high score for me was a guard harassing a guy saying ""You dare steal in my presence? That will cost you your life!"" six times over and over again.Without all the annoying content the repetitive gameplay would not be so bad since the story seems great so far and the great (but currently buggy) engine of the game would compensate for the boring submissions.tl;dr: one of the most annoying games I've ever played and all it would take to fix it is a patch			",143,23,2,23,17,3,13

												I would recommend this game. Greeat original storyline that is well developed and leaves a wide opening for the sequels. My only issue with the game is that it is VERY linear, for example: travel to city, find information on a guy, fight a lot of bad guys, kill the leader, and repeat. Im looking forward to playing the sequels and hope that they can provide extra tangents to this open story and have some mor fun and interesting tasks to accomplish in more diverse locations.

												While the game is nowhere near as good as the games that come after it, Assassin's Creed was the game that kicked off the craze. Yes, the missions get extremely repetitive and the story in this game is utter trash 95% of the time, but it's still a unique and enjoyable game that is a good way to ease yourself into the sprawling franchise. This is the only game in the series that is actually tough at times, but if you can get past it... I guess it's a bit self-rewarding...			",209,73,3,20,18,3,14

												Erm, tried to get this to work for about 2 hours. Game suffered from constant crashes on load and random freezes during gameplay. All the reading I did about it suggested that the primary cause is Ubisoft's DRM trying to phone home and somehow failing in the process. The #1 recommended fix to make the game stable is to disconnect your computer from the internet while playing. No thanks. `.`I also tried the various firewall tweaks and host file edits that were also suggested but none fixed the main DRM symptom. Since I'm interested in checking out the series, I'll just be watching the AC1 cutscenes on youtube instead. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed is a tale of two games: the one that is an interesting and new intelectual property, and the one that reeks of committee-based game design focus grouped for mass market consumption.  I desperately wanted to play the first, but the second wouldn't leave me be and ultimately became the experience of this game.Ubisoft's brand of boring and repetitive combat makes its series debut in AC.  Add to that the three virtually identical main set pieces, and you will be left amazed as I was that so bland a game could come from the hundreds of creative people who had a hand in making this title.  Adding more creativity to the production does not necessarily mean more creativity in the final product to be sure.The tragedy of AC is that underneath all this blandness lies a pretty interesting story of inter-temporal... well... something or other.  The story was obfuscated by the very presentation that was meant to tell it.  I had to youtube the ending and secret story points after beating the game just to see wtf happened.  This obfuscation could have been by design, which is possible as Ubisoft does tend to put the finer points of the game's story into easter eggs to be found by the player.  And maybe that's my fault for not recognizing and engaging that.  But with such a bland gameplay experience, I was left uninterested in anything other than finding something exciting and pulse-pounding about Assassin's Creed, which is ostensibly an action game.  Reading in-game emails and interpreting glyphs on walls would not have qualified as exciting at that point for me.The final and in my opinion unforgivable F-you from Ubisoft is that this game has in effect no ending.  Clearly Ubisoft had intentions to serialize this franchise, which is fine.  But you have to have an ending in the first release of an IP, even if you have a cliffhanger in it as AC did.  The original Halo did it, Star Wars did it.  It's a rule.  Period.Assassin's Creed works, and somewhere in there is a compelling story, but you're probably better off with either of Ubisoft's other platforming/action titles Splinter Cell or Prince of Persia.

												Wow, what a mess of a game.  I'm glad that they dramatically improved the series for AC2, but I cannot recommend this unless you want to suffer through the terrible glitches for the story alone. Oh and, consider just quiting the game a mini-game within itself if you decide to punish yourself with this disaster. (Never thought that just quitting a game could lead to an  uncontrollable urge to rage-quit).Warning:Within 5 minutes of starting a new game, you will want to shove that hidden blade up Altair's bum because he is such an absolute pr*ck. Without a doubt, one of the most unlikeable playable characters in gaming history.			",222,37,2,25,2,0,3

												This is the most inconsistently frustrating game I've played all year. The game seems designed to make you think it has quality and then it punches you in the face with annoying NPCs and redundant quests that have nothing to do with the sparse primary storyline. I'm bailing on it half-way through. I have better, less frustratingly annoying games yet to start. That, and my cursing at the screen has my wife concerned for my physchological state. Seriously? I know people swear by this series, and I purchased several titles in the series on super-sale a while ago; but I think I'm putting this in my ""I hate the Game Mechanics"" library category. I'll watch the YouTube ""Let's Play"" to finish the primary story. This game has way to much grinding and struggling with swooping camera struggles for my taste.			",192,22,10,19,14,1,22

												I've owned this game since 2008 (on Xbox 360) but never got a chance to actually play it till today! 2/4/2014The story is awesome! I really didn't know what to expect beyond some story about an Assassin but man I was pretty surprised. For the first few minutes I had to remap the keybindings for my controller which were really off.. but once I got into the game I was really taken for a ride. I've only played this game for a little over 5 hours but one of the best things I like about this game is the exploration and freerunning. Climbing towers and exploring ancient cities. There are many sidequests and the element of danger was definitely there. Crowds of people walking all over the place. Rub shoulders with the wrong guy and you're in for a fight buddy!The combat feels pretty good at this stage of only playing 5 hours into the game. After completing a few missions I unlocked some abilities like Counter Attack that made combat more in my favor.. or that's what I thought until I ran into a Knight that totally kicked my rear end. But you know whats cool? I grabbed that Knight's attention, climbed a tower, he followed up after me planning on destroying my face, but the moment he stepped off that ladder... I threw him off that tower to his death! Splat my good Sir! Sweet revenge after dying a few times to his brutal power.Again I've only played a few hours into the game earlier today, but I've had a blast so far. It's definitely a great Action/Adventure type of game, I'll be talking about this older game to some of my friends next week for sure! Haha			",941,373,35,99,123,11,189

Posted: January 23, 2015
												I am utterly baffled as to why there is so much nostalgia and love for this game. It is, of all the Assassin's Creed games, the most unpolished, glitchy and baldly unplayable. Considering most of the other games are rather mediocre, and that this is the worst of them, this praise, again, astounds me.I have heard praises heaped upon this game for it's narrative, for it's gameplay mechanics, and for it's primary protagonist. All 3 of these points fall flat when put to scrutiny.Let us look first at the narrative. I will spoil it, though for such a inane and so ideologically uninteresting of a story, one could hardly spoil it. The structure of the narrative revolves around a process of reclaiming your character's honor and position within the Assassin Order after they disgraced themselves by betraying the creed's 3 tenets.To this end, you eliminate 9 targets, learning of a templar conspiracy. As you take them out, the assassin versus templar conflict becomes clear. Both the assassins and templars are secular humanists, so to speak. They both recognize religion, God, spiritual belief, philosophy, morality, and universal truths to be illusions manufactured by man.Their difference is in the conclusions they come to from this recognition. The assassins seem to advocate liberty, that they would dispel the illusions, that they trust humanity with this. They think human nature good enough to find it's own truths without the illusions. So, freedom is their ideal.The templars would not dispel the illusion, fearing the chaos that would come from it. They would maintain the illusion that they might maintain order. In fact, they would strengthen the existing hierarchies, religions, and authorities so they might further build an order to which all men serve. A new world order.There's some sci-fi garbage somewhere in there revolving around a race who came before and how they or their artifacts manufactured all the various miracles and religious events throughout history. Whatever, it's abysmal at best.It comes to pass that the templars you are eliminating are part of the same order as the assassin's mentor, Al Mualim, is also a templar, and was using you to kill the other leaders of the order so he would be free of any obligation to share power. This is the same narrative twist we see used in a couple other, hugely superior games. In Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic, a long chain of side quests where you work for elite bounty hunters known as the genoharadan -- the same form of twist is used. In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the Dark Brotherhood questline concludes with a series of contracts that ends in a similar twist as well.The conclusion we should make here is simply that the same sort of narrative has been told before with more interesting characters, conflicts, moral questions, and acceptable gameplay mechanics -- all things Assassin's Creed lacks.As for the main protagonist, let us discuss the glorious, nuanced character of Altair that receives so much praise. Great lines of dialogue delivered in a monotone, flat, American accent -- Altair is, one would infer, Middle-Eastern. Seriously just listen to some of the lines he delivers, the voice acting is hilariously terrible. The character in the beginning so obviously set up for an arrogant-character-is-humbled-and-has-to-rediscover-honor-and-self cliche it's unbearable waiting for it to happen.The gameplay mechanics are the most unnacceptable features of the game. Combat is slow, awkward and frustrating. Climbing and physics are beyond stupid. Gravity in the 1st game works like this: jump off building, fall normally for 10 feet or so, stop completely midair and resume falling but instead straight down, no matter the trajectory you had originally.Missions structure is the same literally every time. Do around 3 investigations upon entering a city, consisting of folllowing someone and beating them up, eavesdropping, or doing race or assassination minigames. This is supposedly to gather information on your target. In practice it seems useless, as every assassination seems a wholly scripted event, the investigations just repetitive and unneeded hoops/filler the game forces the player through to advance the shoddy story.Glitches are, of course, prominent and further make the game a frustrating and difficult experience to push through.Please don't play this game. While none of the Assassin's Creed games are great, any other game in the series is preferable to this one.			",123,22,1,19,7,1,10

												The first part of the famous stealth action-adventure series. It laid out strong foundations for the following games but sadly can't stand on its own.Pros* The scenario show the Templars as ambiguous enemies rather than just as evil monsters* Many historical characters are involved and you can visit culturally-important places like the Great Mosque of Damascus* Videogame elements such as checkpoints and regenerating life are interestingly part of the story* The graphics are still strong for a game that was released in 2008Cons* The PC port is awful - you can't exit the game quickly, game-breaking crashes will happen several time and an option to display subtitles is lacking* The handling is poor and too often you will die or be spotted due to the game not registering correctly your intentions* Extremely repetitive gameplay and the bizarre need to fill the ending with combatIt's sad but the game is really just a tech demo for the rest of the series. Assassin's Creed is extremely frustrating, which is a shame considering the story is good and taking place in such an underrepresented setting.			",306,77,1,37,18,0,34

												The game could be much better if there would be no combat and less towers. Gameplay becomes repetative after two cities - climb the tower, find the objective, RUN FROM THE GUARDS, kill the target, go to the bureau and move onto the next target. Free-run is pretty cool, climbing animations are smooth. However the climbing process is so simplified that it becomes boring pretty soon. Guards everywhere disrupt the running pretty often and sometimes it is VERY ANNOYING. By some reason regular people (not guards) may throw rocks at you while you are climbing - a person who gave them that ability must be fired. It seems that it was forbidden to drive the horse fast back in these days - the police will chase you if you break the speed limit (stealing horses is still fine). A wast amount of collectibles (420 flags and 60 tampliers) is useless - there is no reward for collecting them.Combat is horrible - there is no lock-on so you will change your target every time you move the mouse. You can avoid fighting till memory block 6 when you'll be forced to kill a small army (and this is not how the True Assassins™ do). Seriously, it is frustrating to fight more than two persons.Sound is good, graphics are fine, story exists. The game is playable, but is far from perfect assassin simulator. Get it on sale, play till the sixth block and then uninstall.			",523,146,25,56,47,5,65

												It's good, really, but...It's fun to start off with, but it gets unbelievably repetitive way before the end. The mission types repeat and repeat and repeat, and one (eavesdropping) doesn't even involve gameplay. Climbing viewpoints gets tedious most quickly, and there are (by my count) 91 of them in the game. Some aren't that high, but some are these ridiculous towers it takes probably well over a minute to climb, sync and dive from.The free running feels good, except when you randomly stop climbing or you randomly fail to jump to or grab something or it just doesn't respond properly in the heat of the moment.The combat is alright, but it doesn't really make sense that when you're surrounded by enemies, only one attacks you at any given time.The graphics are still decent, but even with the highest settings there's heavy LOD-popping going on as you roam around, especially in 'the kingdom', the area in between the key cities. And the shadow resolution drops, jarringly, for anything further than a few metres from you. People even popped into existence before my eyes once or twice. You do get to ride a horse through the kingdom though, which is strangely satisfying.The story is alright but the most interesting part is the 'present day' stuff, which really doesn't tell a proper story, more like the first couple of chapters. Oh and you know what's the most annoying? The drunks, beggars and deranged who annoy the absolute shitzu out of you any time you're on street level.So... I strongly suggest watching the cutscenes on YouTube and skipping right to the second game, unless you're the neurotic type who feels compelled to play through all of them (like me). But if that's the case, play in short bursts and definitely don't waste your time trying to collect the hundreds of flags scattered through the game. There's no fun to be had doing that, and not even any pointless achievements.Also, the game has no subtitles whatsoever.			",302,48,12,22,9,2,26

												It's hard to recommend the first assassin's creed. The controls are very clunky and the story is very basic and simple. If you want to start with the franchise I would recommend one of the ezio games or black flag. The gameplay seems very repetitive now and hasn't aged well compared to the other titles.

												I guess I can see how this game would have been amazing back at the time of release, but I thought it was pretty lackluster. It's cool hoppping and climbing around like a ♥♥♥♥in' monkey, but the gameplay is so repetitive, the environment is frustratingly similar everywhere you go, and the combat is really pretty boring for how often you get stuck in it. Fleeing was fun the first couple times, but then it just got tedious what with Altair 'tarding out and climbing up♥♥♥♥♥♥I didn't want him to and causing me to have to run another marathon to find somewhere else to hide.And I can't tell you how many times I actually threw my hands up in frustration at the crazy homeless guys shoving me into guards. I swear they actually follow you waiting to strike. Thank you Assassin's Creed for causing me to develop a legit hatred for homeless crazies.			",239,79,7,25,30,1,43

												The game completely and utterly sucks. The controls are horrible (M/KB or controller - I played on a controller and they're equally awful), not precise at all when you try to climb on things, most of the time you don't go in the direction you indend or it fails to function properly. In general, climbing plain sucks and when it's one of the main draws of the game, it hurts immensly. Also the little side quests needed to do assassinations are one of a handful of recycled missions throughout the entire game it get repetative very fast. Plus, field of view for enemies is laughibly bad. Additionally combat is boring as hell, unresponsive, and the again the controls suck for that too. With that said, the combat is actually incredibly easy at the same time - have fun countering the entire game and doing nothing else to kill enemies while in the process never getting hit. This game is so repetative, with poor controls, and an incredibly dull main character (all the characters act like cardboard cutouts with no personalities) - not to mention a pretty lame ending. I don't see how anyone in their right mind could like this game. Oh and did I mention a bug that can currupt your savegame at random at any point in your playthrough - that's been present since it was released in 2007? Yeah - enjoy having to delete your save and start from the begining if that happens to you, even if you're 99% through.1/10 - simply because the graphics were decent the year this was released, and it spawned better future Assassin Creed games.I payed $5 for it, it wouldn't even recomoned playing this if it were free for your sanities sake - one of the worst games I have ever played. Luckily, it spawned a good series despite being such a failure. With that said don't let disuade you from the rest of the series. My advice, skip Assassin's Creed 1 read a synopsis on wikipedia and jump striaight in Assassin's Creed 2 - which is actually a good game.			",111,18,0,11,10,0,23

												Monotone, boring, downright awful piece of a game, that's how I would describe the first Assassin's Creed entry. The missions are so unbelievably tedious it almost hurts. Fetch some flags here kill couple of random guards who spawn out of your♥♥♥♥♥there, climb a tower to unlock the map now rinse and repeat 50 more times. That pretty much sums up what the game is all about. The story is almost non existent, you're just on your way killing 9 random dudes because they are bad doing bad stuff there is absolutly no motivation whatsoever. The parkour part is partly broken. For some reason Altair keeps jumping in every direction except the one I want him to, he also gets constantly stuck looking at the damn edge of a building which is 10 cm above his head instead of climbing it up. Come on man, you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ assassin, that's ridiculous! At the end I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, just start with the second entry which is by miles better and offers tons more of content than this piece of garbage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really don't understand all the hype around Assassin's Creed franchise. These first one seems like prototype with very many flaws. Only thing that I can really approve is graphics which are pretty good (in respect to release date). Story is so-so, it's good idea poorly executed with bad pacing (it gets better closer to the end). Sound/music is decent but nothing memorable. The biggest problems are emptiness of the world, lack of content and poor and overly simplistic combat. Also, this is a game about assassin's and there is no stealth. And to mention it, controls and camera could use some improvements but they are good enough most of the time. Overall, I am disappointent with first Assassin's Creed game.4,5/10			",286,100,6,60,33,1,81

												I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this game is. I bought the first 5 games of series because of the popularity and started with the AC 1. I wanted to start at the beginning of the story. First the game is beyond repitive. You have like say maybee 6 different quests and that's it. It's the same quests over and over and over. Then the maps are the same exact looking areas doing the same exact quests. Oh yea and the game is beyond buggy. It's like playing a crappy beta. The fighting also is atrocious. Even the open world is terrible due to the fact that you can never really run around and you have people literally just block your way every step. I hate this game. I think I won't even play the next 4 AC games I got because I simply hated playing the first one. I quit on memory 6 after i was yelling at my comp bug after bug after bug. Seriously don't waste your time on this garbage. Should of never been released.			",192,13,4,10,12,0,7

After the first time I thought I'd give the game another try but it disappointed me.I really would have liked to complete the game however it's not possible without starting again and again.Moreover, it's quite frustrating to have to start again and so I don't recommend buying this game.It is fun, it is cool but it's not possible to complete the game without becoming frustrated.

												For me I did not enjoy this game at all. I even say Unity was better than this. This game has an okay story but it is so repetitive. ""Go to that city, assassinate the guy there, good now go back to master and tell him."" The combat is plain awful and I did not say it was hard it was the fact that you just do everything in a repetitive way that you get so bored of it. I wanted to finish this because I have Ezio Collection for my PS4 to play and I wanted to see what AC1 was all about but I could not stand the tedious gameplay that it brought me. 2/10 worst game in franchise			",21,1,0,0,1,0,3

												One of the most overrated games I've ever played. Parkour is constantly bumbling about. Controls are a mess and unresponsive. Takes Altair like 3 seconds to animate the run motion. So you're a master assasin right? You cant counter until after your first mission. And you don't learn how to DODGE until like 1/2 through the game. ridiculous. Ok so the bureau wants you to be a proper asssassin. So teach me by forcing mini tutorials instead of unlocking ESSENTIAL moves halfway through the game. If I'm an assassin, I expect to be stealthy. Don't be fooled. You CANNOT stealth assassinate any of the targets so far. I'm about half through the game at this point. No ledge kills. No whiste attract. No throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥to distract. WTF. This is NOT a stealth game. The ""game"" barely qualifies as entertainemnt. It's just a parkout simulator with some terrible combat thrown in. I'm literally going to do the minimum from now. This extra intel just isn't compelling and helps very little with the targets. Shadow of Mordor is a FAR better game.After writing this review, I just got more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ So♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm uninstalling.

												Just finished replaying through this game as I have not played it since it was released back in the day on Xbox 360.*****If you have never played Assassin's creed before, this game is a must play. Ignore everything below, as that is written from the POV of someone who has played and completed nearly every game in the entire series, and went back and played this one now on PC. The series was one of the best and most revolutionary ones there were. I wish I could experience them for the first time again.*****As someone who has played every single Assasin's Creed from start to finish, going back and playing this game was painful in terms of the mechanics, camera angles, repetitiveness. The main story-line is still good although repeptitive, and I did enjoy the nostalgia seeing how the series got started in terms of the pieces of eden, abstergo, and desmond.However you are assigned to assassinate a total of 9 people, and before you can kill one of them, you must complete at least 2-3 mini tasks. There are only 3 different mini tasks in the entire game: Pickpocket a random citizen for info, talk to an informant and complete his task, and beat up a random preacher/well-know citizen to get info from them. You do this NINE times. You literally pickpocket, escort/run through city, and fist fight a citizen a total of 25-27 times, and then assasinate a target. (9 main kills, 2-3 mini tasks before each one).Once again want to emphasize if you've never played the series, please get this and play it through, as you're starting one of the best and most successful game franchises of all time. First time played: 9/10Going back years later after playing the whole series: 7/10			",122,15,1,8,5,2,6

												Excessively repetitive. You do the same things all over the game, use the same methods and even fight in the same way. The game gets very repetitive and easy once you learn the basics. If you enjoy doing the same thing for hours and hours over and over a game, then I suppose you should give the game a chance. If not, move along, this is not the game for you.			",42,7,0,7,10,0,7

												How this series managed to take off with such a terrible first installment is beyond me. The plot is hopelessly convoluted, and the game makes you slowly plod through repetitive tasks, working toward an unsatisfying resolution. Combat is the grandaddy of basic whack-a-mole ""Press X to win"" garbage, further dulled down with AI that hurtles back and forth between the two extremes of utter cluelessness and psychic ability. What little challenge this game offers comes from trying to cope with its godawful camera and unintuitive control scheme. Oh, and you can pile random hangs, freezes, and crashing on top of the whole heap. The only things Jade's Game does manage to get right are atmosphere and level design, and while it demonstrates a keen grasp of those two concepts, it's not enough to redeem the project as a whole.

												Didn't like this game when it came out. Still don't. I like the world it sets up for though. The gameplay itself is awful. Controls are clumsy. Character moves frustratingly slow for being some ultra elite acrobatic assassin. Combat is a joke. And the sidequests are copy pasted from GTA III with the cars removed along with any semblence of fun they may have had originally. Now AC II is a different story. It elaborates on the interesting world and fixes most of the horrendous gameplay problems, but that's just it. If AC and AC II were one movie. AC would be the 10 minute prelude that sets up for the actual movie. Except this prelude lasts 15 hours. Basically, if you haven't played AC, but want to play AC. Go look up the plot online for the first game, watch a few youtube videos about it, then go buy AC II. This game was bad when it came out, and the more AC games that come out, the worse this garbage smells.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game production and graphics are good, but thats about it.The gameplay is repetitive, tasks, combat and locations repeat themselves and get boring very quickly.Biggest downside of the game is the story. The pace, in which it is told, is so slow that you forget why you have to assassinate people and in what way this all impacts on the person in the lab. And when you finally reach the end of the game, to get the story conclusion you will be left alone with a cliffhanger to buy part two of the series. Utterly disappointing and a chore to play through the whole game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												2 out of 10.  Not worth it, even on sale.One of the few games I've actually given up on, and should be the textbook example of why PC gamers hate console ports.  The controls are some of the worst I've ever fought with, the gameplay is terrible and repetitive, and the fact that you have to manually crash the game to exit in order to avoid the 5-minute nightmare you'd normally have to go through really tops things off and makes the game more like a bad joke than anything.  It had decent enough graphics, but that's really the only good thing I can say about it.			",301,108,8,18,9,5,21

												Perhaps this game was good when first released on consoles, but it hasn't aged well.  It's pretty much the epitome of terrible console port - starting with the menu and exit game mechanism that makes it literally take several minutes to quit unless you press ALT-F4.  Seriously Ubisoft - 6 menus to quit the game?Beyond that, as the game is called Assassin's Creed you would be forgiven for thinking it will be about stealth assassination.  Generally, it's not - very few of the true assassinations in the main plot allow different angles of approach or stealth mechanics.  You would assume an assassin would prefer to avoid doing their work in public, or would prefer to use a handy bow from a nearby roof - you would be wrong, though.  Rather, you are expected to get in close, which inevitably means getting into combat.  That's also a strike - the combat is bloody terrible.  Again, the console port-ness appears, as the combat is typical of other console ports (I'm looking at you, Prince of Persia Sands of Time) and is not at all intuitive for PC players.  Much of it relies on timing moves, which don't appear to register well, and are better suited to a controller.  In fact, the majority of the game is best suited for a controller - or to be watched in a LP rather than played.TL;DR:  For a game that was published well after the Thief series, Deus Ex, and a myriad of others that contain aspects of stealth assassination, they all do it much better than Assassin's Creed.  I bought this for $7 and I drastically overpaid.NOT recommended.			",54,0,0,9,3,0,7

												The mechanics of the game were no doubt revolutionary for its time. The scenery of the game was very beautiful too.  Unfortunately that is where my compliments end. Nothing can hide the fact that you are a dog fetching a stick throughout the game, with its repetitiveness. The fun factor quickly faded and it became a chore to reach the end. I must be in the minority though, as it seems so many actually enjoyed it? To each their own i suppose... now where did i leave that bone?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed series... except the first one. Really, if you're new, just start playing AC2 instead. You won't be missing much. Especially since the intro cinematic to AC2 covers everything important about AC1's story in about 10 seconds. Every mission in the game is ""kill this guy, because reasons"" and starts out with gathering information, which means doing one of 4 types of sidequest where you can do exciting things like sitting on a bench or following someone into an alley so you can punch them a few times. After you do enough repetitive sidequests you unlock the assassination target's location. Then you kill the guy you're supposed to kill then run and hide. Then do it all again for the next target. Nothing changes about the missions other than the location of your target.			",364,94,24,42,44,4,77

												I really wanted to like this game. Perhaps I didn't play it ""right"" or something, but many parts of the game felt like a chore.  Every single mission is exactly the same. As soon as you've seen all three cities, the game is nothing but tedious ""investigation"" quests which consist of finding lame wannabe assassins and doing fetch quests for them. Also peppered throughout the cities are viewpoints, which are actually pretty fun because you have to find ways to climb tall buildings. Then there are the ""rescue citizen"" missions which are so completely out of place it's ridiculous. Sure, let's make the whole game about stealth kills and then force you to fight some guards in the middle of the marketplace in plain view of everyone. Let's also have you do it about 10 times per city. And every citizen has that same canned ""I will repay this kindness I swear it"" line afterwards. The only time this is worthwhile is when you unlock a crowd of scholars to get past some guards. The AI for the guards is absolutely atrocious as well. Just inexcusable. This series got far better with the sequel and the Ezio trilogy. This game feels like a prototype for the series rather than a worthwhile game.			",96,9,0,15,5,0,6

												Now where do I begin.....THis game isnt perfect by no means especially on the PC, I have encountered so many bugs and have had the game crash on me dozens of times, but this game just has that charm with it that you can't just can't say no to. the story in my opinion is great which kept me in the game and the mechanics at the time were revolutionary even though they were a mess looking back at it. Yes it gets very repeatative when you are finding information for each assassination and some of them drove me up the wall but performing that assassination without a problem was just so rewarding. Recomending this game however I just can't do, I love the assassin creed series and I'm always telling people to play them but for PC this was a buggy mess and my DX 10 file would not play so I had to use the DX 9 and that still didnt work perfectly. I recommend you play this on console as it is more stable and less bugs, the graphics might not be up to scratch with the PC but the gameplay will imporve dramatically and less bugs will occurRating 7/10  but as mentioned will play better on consoles			",330,108,3,46,12,0,6

												As much as this game had potential to be good, it falls short in way too many areas for me to think its any more than a 6/10. I really wanted to enjoy this game, but theres nothing about this game that goes beyond good. For starters, the controls are unnecessarily complicated. The fact that it takes 2 buttons and WASD to sprint really proves that. The whole high profile low profile aspect of the controls really make the entire thing feel really clunky. This also leaks over into the combat, which I love in concept, but in execution eventually becomes hold down RMB and then spam LMB after theyre done attacking, at least until you get countering. After that, the combat becomes even more of a joke. Parkour doesn't feel satisfying in the slightest, really all you have to do is press ""W"" and RMB and press space when you plateau. All of this gets really repetitive fast with a storyline that reflects 2 boring AAA movies forced together , a main character that almost borders on shadow the hedgehog levels of edge and sci-fi elements that are completely uncalled for. I really wanted to like♥♥♥♥♥crud, but if I want to play a good open world stealth game, i'd just play Sly Cooper 2 or 3 which does everything this game does better. 6/10 ",253,81,1,27,17,3,18

												So recently I decided to marathon all the Assassin's Creed games available on PC and 100% complete them. This one I didn't 100% complete but I did do the story and some side stuff. Here are my honest thoughts on just the game itself, if you were to buy it now.Pros:-Interesting story line in and out of the Animus.-Combat can be quite satisfactory and challenging.-Is not too easy.-The locations are quite cool and interesting.-Desmond.Cons:-Graphics are very outdated which is unsurprising seeing as how old it is.-Gameplay is very repetitive (do some spying then kill your target). 9 times.-Freerunning is quite slow and clunky, but not too bad.-Cutscenes are very dull, boring and overwinded.-Voice acting isn't great especially from Altair.-Altair is quite a boring character with no spirit.-Being stealthy is very dull, pointless and sometimes very hard.Overall, if you want to have some fun with a one off game then DO NOT BUY THIS, unless maybe it's on sale. There are much funner games for £10. If, however, you want to start the AC games from the beginning and understand it all like me then buy it, but do know IT IS NOT NEEDED! You can easily start from AC 2 and not really miss much as that is a much better game!			",28,9,1,1,1,0,0

												Assassin's Creed is the quaintessential Ubisoft title - fantastic idea, rushed out before it was finished that leaves you disappointed.There is a core game here, which could be amazing. The idea behind the gameplay mechanics are great, and the free running features are smooth at times. Yet, there's nothing more to it. It's essentially a tech-demo.I'm informed that the other Assassin's Creed games are MUCH better, and have a better storyline, and don't have you repeating the game over at the halfway point ala the first Assassin's Creed. If that's the case I look forward to the other Assassin Creed titles.I originally played this game on the 360 when it was initially released. My hype was high and expectations were perhaps uncontrolable. I remember getting into an argument with the Ubisoft rep who would come into our store about how crap the game was. He wasn't too happy that I wasn't going to shill it hard to people. However, the first one is stale and undercooked at the same time. The crashes to desktop are beyond frustrating. DX10 version is unstable and unsupported. The DX9 version strangely runs smoother. I get the impression it's the Steam interface which causes the crashes. Overall, I'd suggest watching the story on youtube and jumping on (hopefully) the much improved Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood. The first game is everything that is currently wrong with Ubisoft:Full of BugsRepeated pointless gameplayCollect 100 lots of 100 different itemsPromises and hopes that never live up to the expectationAll of this distracts from what COULD be a really great game.

												Picked up Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut during a Steam sale as I never played any game of the franchise before. I had high expectations due to the popularity of the franchise. At the beginning you get blown away by the detailed graphics and the openness of the world. You started digging into the combat mechanics, enjoy your stealthy kills and exploring every hidden city corner. But after a few missions, the repetitiveness of it all becomes quite apparent: always the same mini missions, always the same chain of events, the open world where you can do... nothing. Yet another few missions later and you are wondering why you are wasting your time on this... Boredom changes into irritation once you find out that you really don't need to be stealthy nor do you need to explore everything or finish every mini mission. And then I didn't even mention the excruciating game menu, the crappy ending, the poorly scripted conversations (no, there is no escape button). Quickly I didn't feel any sympathy for the main character and the unfolding story. What a missed opportunity this game is... Even at sale, I would not recommend this game.Score: 4/10Pro:+ visuals+ open world+ climbing towers and enjoying great viewsContra:- empty world- repetitive missions- clumsy controls on pc- painful game menu system- irritating camera system			",432,227,19,66,65,2,119

The world and its characters are bland and uninspired, the combat is a chore, the controls are annoying and collecting clues is about as exciting as playing PacMan... without monsters.To top it off, there are *no* subtitles, and considering that the characters talk like bumbling idiots more often than not, good luck understanding what's going on.Just... don't.

												The controls are terrible. You fight the camera just as much as enemy soldiers. You go to the towns and do the SAME quests and side quests throughought the whole game with no variation, and there were several times where the game forces you into combat when all you want to do is run away. The game is just 12 hours of ♥♥♥♥ing boring.			",159,39,0,25,8,0,7

												What happened to the PC port? I remember playing this game on Xbox when it came out. It was a great game. I loved being an assasin. But the bugs are so...Arrrgh! I would not recomend buying this game cause it just won't run on a computer. The console (to my great disatisfaction) is where this game belongs. If you are trying to understand the AC universe, I get it that you want to play the first game, but take it somewhere else. It won't run on your PC and there is nothing you can do about that. I wish you the best of luck.BUT! This is the game to play if you want to know where Altiar came from, just remember you have to climb the mountain every, single, time.			",111,61,1,5,2,2,4

												SO this game obviously created quite a legacy and there's no denying that. It offers a unique perspective on the period of time surrounding the crusades while providing some enjoyable gameplay elements. Unfortunately, this game has many flaws (all of which have been corrected in later games in the series. The initial segments of the game are fun as you explore the world and acclamate to the gameplay mechanics. However, shortly after, you realize you have to do the same thing again. and again. and again. This game gets boring fast, and while the high-level assassinations can be unique, the long periods in between leavemuch to be desired. Additionally, the lack of steam acheivments renders the collecting of flags and the murder of templars pointless, and doing so unlocks no in-game features. The games that would follw this one are spectacular, but I would be lying if I said I really enjoyed this entry in the series. 3/10			",335,120,3,46,32,5,62

												Pretty trash. This probably lay the groundwork for much better games but I pretty much regret wasting an entire day on it and not going straight to 2. The mechanics are super clumsy and infuriating. The b-movie plot is literal garbage. All of the characters are one dimensional dumbdumbs. They try to push this whole moral greyness thing but always show your target doing something egregious first. Eating babies or whatever. It's like grow a pair. Challenge me. Also the scifi bit is horrible.I liked the Middle Eastern setting in the most superficial sense but I think I should have spent my day working and saved up for a trip to Israel.

												I have issues when it comes to games, I feel like I need to play through entire series to get the storyline even if people say the original ones suck.Everyone told me that the original assassin's creed was one of those games, just to avoid it and move onto 2 but I couldn't do it.. I had to play it.It's a really pretty game, even by current 2014 standards.. but aside from that there's not much else in the way of redeeming features. You'll be doing a couple of things in this game, running around exploring, fighting and doing side quests.All the side quests are the same, there's a million 'save a citizen' quests that just involve fighting some guards and then getting one of three canned replies from the person you rescued.. there's no variation in conversation.. by the end of the game you'll have heard a million other people say the same lines whenever you start to climb anything or knock anything over.Climbing / freerunning is the other big thing, but it feels a bit gimmicky in the game, there's very little reason to use it other than the game forcing you to use it to explore areas by getting to vantage points.By the end of the game I was using it for that purpose and just to get places quite far away quickly, everything else was easier to just stay on the ground in my opinion.Combat itself isn't fluid and locks away most of your combat moves until you progress the game, which makes combat start out clumsy and boring and ends up the same way as every combat move you get is defensive in nature, the entire combat system boils down to defending and counterattacking.. there's never any storming in and killing everyone like a badass.. there's storming and and defending yourself until everyone dies which just does not have the same feeling at all.Even the ending just really truly sucks, I don't want to put up any spoilers but it's one of the most dissapointing experiences I've had finishing a game.The entire game is repititous and feels extremely grindy, by the end I was putting it on for an hour and then turning it off because it just felt like work.. unless you have the same issue as me and need to see the game yourself for the storyline before moving onto the next, then honestly skip this game. It's not awful, but it's absolutely not fun.			",1271,459,43,174,110,11,227

												A very disappointing game.This is the 3rd game I bought on Steam many years ago (2009) and had technical difficulties on my old PC so I left it on the backburner since.I finally got to play it past the tutorial and it was okay.Then I went for the second prey and it was the same. Then the 3rd prey...still the same.Finally the 4th prey...still no change.It's always go there and climb all towers to get the map, do at least 1 activity then report to the bureau for some useless idle talk and finally hunt the target.Controls are not great, characters not particularly interesting and the present time scenes are barely useful, especially considering how slow it all is.In the end, interesting concept with a really nice presentation of its historical setting (a period / place not scene often in games) but terribly repetitive with no real incentive to wander around.

												Boring and repetetive. Its initial shine quickly fades to give room to endless slodging through the same side quests you finish before each one of the nine assassination attempts that you must complete in order to progress through the game. The stealth mechanic is decent, though it oftentimes is undermined by the overall arcadedy feel of the game. Did it only once to experience the story and don't plan to do it ever again. If you plan to tackle this franchise you might as well skip this one, or just watch the story gameplay videos on youtube.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not a game that stands the test of time at all. It has nostalgia factor but playing through it today only serves to make me realize how far the series has come in terms of pure playability. AC has never been known for great combat, but this game has combat you'll avoid at all times because it will make you impatient. Waiting ten seconds for enemies to hit you is not tense, it's an annoying filler task that serves to make the game boring.The climbing is also very problematic, Altair will get stuck on things for absolutely no reason forcing you to drop and then try climbing all over again. The game also places a very large emphasis on stealth without having any practical stealth mechanics. The mission structure was cool in theory but it's poorly executed. It gives you no freedom and every assassination is extremely scripted.I'd LOVE LOVE LOVE to see this game updated for the modern audience on say, the Unity engine with better climbing mechanics, combat that doesn't suck and actual open ended assassination and info gathering. As it stands, this game feels like nothing more than the beta for the second game which improved things exponentially (except I was disappointed that the second game went for a less ambitious structure, but considering everything else it fixed I can forgive it).Read up the story of this game on Wikipedia then play the second if you want to get into the series. The reviews may hold this game in high regard, but this was the difficult dark age of 2007.			",227,22,3,11,10,0,12

												Honestly, not a fan.  My biggest complaint is that the gameplay is repetitive, predictable, and just generally boring.  Go to area, receive intel by doing generic activities, kill boss.  Lather, rinse, repeat. The controls are fine... sometimes.  Other times, (usually during a chase when it matters the most,) they are frustratingly bad.  And overall, there are a lot of things that just don't make any sense.  For example, every single city guard has no difficulty whatsoever when it comes to climbing walls and jumping from building to building.  They can even keep up with you, the trained assassin.  I understand why it was necessary, (otherwise you would be essentially invincible on rooftops,) but it feels out of place, especially when the rest of the game strives for realism and historical accuracy.This isn't to say that the whole franchise is terrible.  I've already started playing the second game, and it is better in basically every single aspect.  I personally would recommend skipping this game and going straight on to Assassin's Creed II if you are interested in playing the series.			",438,144,9,40,30,2,66

												Assassin's Creed™ is the next-gen game developed by Ubisoft Montreal that redefines the action genre. While other games claim to be next-gen with impressive graphics and physics, Assassin's Creed merges technology, game design, theme and emotions into a world where you instigate chaos and become a vulnerable, yet powerful, agent of change. The setting is 1191 AD. The Third Crusade is tearing the Holy Land apart. You, Altair, intend to stop the hostilities by suppressing both sides of the conflict. You are an Assassin, a warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your ruthlessness. Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, and your existence will shape events during this pivotal moment in history.			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												I would've never guessed this was the game that spawned a big-budget annual series.  It's just so boring.  Even simple things like loading up the game are needlessly long and dull.  Start game, pick load save, get sent to some lab in the present day, pick load game, and then you're finally in the portion of the game you want to play.  What the hell.  It's the same process for quitting the game, so you're better just manually shutting it down to save yourself the time.From the 90-120 minutes I played, there was very little action and what there was was poorly executed, and I've read it's just more the same as the game continues.  There was also a lot of boring cut-scenes for the short amount I played the game.  Didn't care for how it handled with either mouse/keyboard or with a controller.  Action events like fighting, sneaking, moving around were blah as well.I disliked this game so much that it soured me on bothering with the series as a whole despite already having a free copy of Black Flag, which is supposedly a good game.  I just can't get over how poor this was in everything outside the graphics department.			",819,341,18,129,81,12,101

												This, right here, is an example of a bad port. It plays great on the X360, even if the controls take a little getting used to. But on the PC? It's just plain unintuitive. Half the time I played it with a remote, I had to use my mouse and controller anyway because the program decided ""Not today.""Also, I got Shadow of Mordor after playing this  and  Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. Shadow of Mordor is a far superior game to both in my mind. The combat feels better, the atmosphere is more clear in where it wants to be, and the story feels like more of an assassin game. Assassin's Creed feels more like ""Pride's Blunder: Climb Back Up the Ranks""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me give you a little insight into how I organize my steam games. I've got a folder for multiplayer games; that should be self explanatory. I've got a folder for currently installed games; that also is self explanatory. There's a folder for games I wish to play, a folder for games that I may play at some point, a folder for games I won't ever play that mostly consist of the extra, unwanted humble bundle games, and then there's the last folder. This folder is called ""Absolute Garbage Full of♥♥♥♥♥"" There are only two games in this folder, two games that are the worst of humanity and deserve nothing more than to be displayed in Museums where they display rotten games. One game is Deus Ex: Invisible War, the game that marked Ion Storm's downfall as they pandered to consoles, much like Crytek. The other is Assassin's Creed.Don't get me wrong, the Assassin's Creed series is not a terrible one, or so I've been told. I have only played this one and Assassin's Creed 3. I did not like Assassin's Creed 3, but dear god does it fail in comparison to this piece of flaky bull. You start out with a rather interesting concept of a story; you're in a laboratory undergoing a simulation to relate to your knife-oriented ancestors in some plot involving Templars. You go through an intro with some heavy fighting and you're thinking ""Oh, okay, this definitely is not a stealth game. This is a hack n slash."" But whatever right? You suppose it can still be fun, right? Wrong, ♥♥♥♥ you. You get these awful controls and repitive combat that make you yearn to go play with a toaster; at the very least the toaster would be responsive to controls. But whatever, again, you think, who cares if the combat is boring? I'm in it for the raw gameplay. Parkour man. Doing side quests. Story!Well, I'll give you that. Parkour is enjoyable. The wall climbing feels satisfying when you scale insurmountable heights leading up to the conclusion of a bird's nest at the peak of a city. But that's really the only thing it has going for it. When you enter a city, the side quests are by far the most boring, repititve, garbage nonsense that half the time doesn't even make sense. Why am I capturing flags? Why is there a time limit? I'm a trained assassin, not a crazed blue coin collector. There's tons of people being harassed and you can intervene, but why? You're told you're supposed to blend in, not ostracize yourself. Even if they did make sense, they're so senselessly boring the second time around that you do any of them.But hey, there's no uPlay.			",264,72,4,31,17,2,23

												This game tho.......This game defines what it is to f*ck up an AC game! (It's the first one, but still!) Have played pretty much every AC game there is, then I bought this on sale just to try it out, and man I regret using my poor money on this sh*tload of f*ck! The game is so repetitive, and the enemies can sometimes be so hard to kill, that you are probably better off trying to eat your own sh*t, then sh*t that sh*t out of your @ss, only to suck the sh*t up your @ss again and puke the sh*t on to your monitor (probably how they made this game). I promiz man, if you only like the plot, then I guess this is an OK game for you (if you like to farm for 7 hours). The only reason I managed to beat this game was by using Cheat Engine (#Promotion). I gave myself infinite health so that I never died. Still took ♥♥♥♥ing forever to kill the f*ckers in the game. All in all this game is Big Rigs quality, the gameplay is sh*t! The story is sh*t!#Spoilers: Don't trust people that looks like they work for the f*cking Al Quaida, obviously the old f*cker betrays your @ss and you have to kill him. I knew that sh*t all along as I played the game! It's more obvious than 1+1 after going to school for 11 years!Also I KNOW that this review will get lots of hate. Therefore my message to you: ""Go f*ck yourself, eat sh*t, and jump in the river like Altair, just without respawning!""			",68,2,0,3,5,0,1

												I love the premise of the game. I liked the setting and the story. I got to Damascus before I gave up. Not because it was hard, but because the port for this game is so hilariously bad that it's ruining the whole experience. No crashes, nothing like that for me. But for the tutorial the problems started as soon as the game was supposed to tell me how to sprint. ""Press button 1"". Wth is button 1?! Tried every button I could come up with, nothing worked, went in to control settings and set sprint to shift. Next up was ""button 0"". Same procedure. And the mouse isn't even included in the game?! You can't set any of the controls to mouse buttons. So now I'm fighting with Ctrl. What the actual ♥♥♥♥? Oh, and you can't exit the game without force quitting it. When you click ""Exit game"" you end up with a classic console starting screen with ""Press any button"" written over it. When I press any button I get to select profile. So the only way to quit the game is to Tab-Alt to desktop and then force quit it. Lovely.			",47,17,0,13,2,1,12

												I never understood the hype about this game.And having played it for a bit now, I still don't get it.It is bad. Sooooo bad.Repetitive to the extreme. Unintuitive.Bad combat ""system"".Boring, copy-paste side missions.The main missions aren't any better.Copy-paste all the way through.Half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥stealth aspect - if you can even call it that.Why do you play an assassin and then go out and attack every victim in plain sight of the whole damn city?Why can't you stealth kill someone, poison him maybe or murder him in his sleep? Anything would be better than what amounts to basically a full frontal attack.Why do you have to crawl between the cities? Why do the guards/knights attack you immediatly just because you let your horse galopp a bit? The journey between cities is pointless enough as it is, why do I have to do it in the slowest speed possible? To pad out the game's length...Why do I have to do the exact same thing in every frickin city? Like hide with the monks and super-slowly walk into the city ...Probably just to pad out the run-time of the game.The cities and the countryside are severly under-used.There is no point really in exploring in this game - except if you want the achievements.And, man, getting the achievements in this game really feels like a chore; something terrible like cleaning a public toilet with your tongue - it doesn't matter how fast or how slow you do it, you'll still end up with a mouth full of♥♥♥♥♥♥Apparently, you can only climb up towers. You cannot climb down but must jump down into a haystack? WTF?There are so many aspects that could have been good but simply weren't used well.The undecover ability apparently only lets you blend in with monks/scholars (because you simply cannot chang your kick♥♥♥♥♥clothes)The stealth ability isn't really there. No sneaking up to someone and backstabbing them. Or really using your surroundings to attack your victim.The cities could have been really fleshed out with enterable houses (alternative routes), with NPCs that actually give you actual, useful information. And  alternative ways to eliminate the targets.The parts out of VR are just tedious because your character is walking even slower, if that's even possible. And you have to crawl to certain points in the lab where you are to progress the story. Why? I haven't the faintest. Well, otherwise the game won't proceed ...			",146,79,0,27,3,0,6

												The first thing you will notice are the vastly outdated graphics, which just hurt your eyes and are nothing like the trailers and the screenshots. Everything is downgraded as usual. However, this is not the biggest of surprises in the game industry these days, so in my generosity, it can be forgiven.What I and many others fail to understand is the concept of the game, for it simply isnt very well thought out before put into use. This is very obvious when you really start to understand the gameplay and try to execute the things you observe the game showing you, which eventually feels clunky, outdated and sometimes, unfortunately, even flat-out depressing. Gameplay-wise, the game holds your hand almost all the time and it becomes really annoying, when you start to notice you have no real difference in the course of action. There are moments where you just feel completely lost and get annoyed at how everything doesnt quite fit together. The controls dont feel fluid at all, and occasionally you feel like you're either stuck in the mud or glue, or the game intentionally was made hard and frustrating to control. Why would anyone want to offer the players of their game an experience like this? And what's really frustrating are the sounds. It's like someone literally wanted to hire one of the worst composers, voice actors and the sound designers for this kind of a game! Could it be simply a bad decision from the lead of this project or very, very dark humor from the entire team of the game developers? You decide!And dont even get me started on the AI. It's rather non-existent. Some games are famous for their silly bot-AI that keeps doing mistakes and failing at the only thing it was designed to do. The only difference between those games and this is that the AI here isn't even funny. It just wants to make you shout at it's actions in utter rage. The performance of the game tends to be lackluster. Ive seen it perform badly on many different specs and machines, which cannot garner much respect, but at this point it doesn't really surprise, either.All this could be fixed with at least a long, interesting story that would give content for your money and/or time, but it doesn't really offer either. When you thought it couldn't get any worse, the game has more bugs here and there, hindering your already non-existent progressing and sucking the last drops of joy out of the experienceOn top of all of this, the game is insanely difficult to progress in. Everything has been made non-intuitive for the average gamer, to the point even hardcore difficulty masochists will find it unpleasant to experience. It all makes you think: Where is the gaming industry heading these days? ",30,0,0,4,5,0,1

												I tried to like it, but I'm constantly wrestling with controls, camera, and missing features modern games have (like fast travel, for example).Controls are idiotic. You have to hold three damn keys just to sprint. Climbing things isn't too fun either, because the guy is really slow doing it and often he can't reach to climb and it takes you a second to realize that, because of his slowness. When you run to an edge of something, you just ""stare"" down instead of jumping or doing anything sensible. You have to press ""other hand"" control. The reason for the mess with the controls is 'cause you have ""low profile"" and ""high profile"" modes. The low-profile mode is annoying as hell, however, because you move around like a snail. Same goes for some places like the Abstergo lab or some buildings: you can't sprint, you can only ""walk"" which takes forever.Speaking of profiles, you have to actually use a horse to move around cities. I searched around whether there's a fast travel mode, and apparently there is, but not in all the places and you have to get to the edge of the map or something. Annoying. This means if you want to move at any appreciable speed, you have to ""gallop"" in high profile mode which, for some reason, makes every random dude with a sword want to kill you.Now, you may think me being on a horse and the dudes being on foot... I can just run away! What's the problem then? Well, the problem is one of the more annoying features of the game: the detection meter. Whoever thought it was an awesome idea for it to loudly beep should be fired. So, it beeps if you're in an area where you might get attacked. If you get detected, it starts to beep even louder. And if you run away? Hell, that thing will beep forever! You actually have to find a bush somewhere and jump into the bush and sit there for a minute just to shut that stupid beeper off—no other reason; there's no one chasing you any more!So for the last three hours, I feel like I've done nothing but wrestle with controls and get annoyed with the damned beeper.As for the story, well, it may be a good one, but I already dislike the guy I'm playing as. He's a rebel in one sentence and submissive in another. He's all over the place and I don't want to be him.I don't recommend this outdated game.			",120,5,6,11,11,0,8

												frankly, the first title does not live upto the sequel which is very rare in any media franchise. Ubisoft wasted their great resources yet again. The concept is unique and very impressive in many aspects, but the excution is poorly done. Though, I'm glad they actually revived it in the sequel, but I wanted to warn others if they thought the first title has a value of the sequel. In a short term, the experience is very repetitive and the traveling is very time consuming. Battle mechanic is difficult to handle, and the objectives are pretty much the same from other maps. Not much of variation in design. Unskippable cut scenes are one of the agony to endure. In other locations, they set up the same camera perspectives while listening to yadi-yadi-yada. Story itself begins with great impression and ends with disappointment. I really wish the title should have kept in the past time line not the present.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassins Creed is a good example of good concepts that were completely overshadowed by repetitiveness. In assassin’s creed you will hop across and climb buildings as if gravity doesn’t exist, you will fall from the sky to assassinate your enemies like a badass. Yet when it comes to water, you’ll drown every single time. The interface, graphics, and controls scream console port, but it’s still far from being impossible to play or enjoy. The game became super bland and boring sometime after your second assassination, the game has the same routine for every city assassination. Climb buildings, eagle view, “beat people, steal, or race around town for information”, and then finally kill your target. The storyline is slightly above average with an ok ending but the awfully repetitive gameplay may bore you to the point of quitting before it’s even over. This game sets the foundation for all future AC game; you might want to play this if you’re interested in the series.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												   This game is unplayable for the most part due to crashes (Win 7).    I've tried all the fixes, and all the usual nonsense, and I'm lucky to get 30 minutes of continuous gameplay before it crashes.    Given that it's a typical PC port, getting in and out of this game and bypassing cut scenes makes the scenario of it crashing unbearable.   Fixes/nonsense tried:* DX10 Vista compatibility mode:   Didn't fix crashing.* Normal DX9/DX10:  Didn't fix crashing.* acii_360_wireless driver fix:   This did fix the controller mapping, imagine it will for AC II as well.* All fixes tried with disabling multiple displays:   Didn't fix crashing. If you really want to play this game, I'd suggest snagging it on console (if you have that luxury).    Steam should refund anyone who has experienced the level of crashing/nonsense associated with this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed- games are love or hate kind of games much like Battlefield or Call of Duty. I myself as a history buff have enjoyed each and everyone of the game in the franchise. Each game feels different and is made to be different unlike COD. The reason why I like this one is because of the setting (Middle ages) and how beautiful the game looks. Also the Desmond trilogy (AC 1-3) has the strongest storyline. I liked Black Flag, Rogue and Unity aswell and I'm waiting for Syndicate, because each game changes the gameplay and the feeling to it.BUT the first part in AC is repetitive because of the game's mechanic. I honestly prefer AC II over I because of the variety of missions and activities. This game will remain a classic for me but it's not the best in the series unlike most games are.Oh and it's the only AC game that doesn't require Uplay, even tough I have nothing against Ubisoft. Some people on Steam complain it on a daily basis which I don't get. I agree that you can have opinion but whining about Uplay or Ubisoft isn't good for your health.But verdict, it's an 8/10 game.

												I played this a long time ago on the 360 but could never really finish it due to varying reasons. But seeing as all the Assassin Creed games are on sale I went ahead and got all of them for a pretty decent price of $5 a piece, which isn’t bad for such a big series. Replaying through the game the story isn’t half bad, and am looking forward to reviewing the other Assassins Creed games in time.One big negative thing is the way climbing works.  It isn’t horrible, but there are times where you would want to climb up a building fast rather than jump off a building killing yourself in the process.  Other than that, this was a big hit in the series and is a great story, providing you are more of a story driven person. 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this game, you play as a Syrian man named Altair Ibn-La-Ahad, and he is part of an order of Assassins (hence the name Assassin's Creed). You start the game in real time, as a man named Desmond who has been taken by a company known as Abstergo Industries, a company where they are secretly part of the order of the Knight's Templars. The Templars are enemies to Assassins, and since Desmond is an ancestor of the previously meantioned assassin Altair, the head executive and his assistant Lucy put Desmond into a machine called the Animus. The Animus lets a person delve into his ancestor's memories, and since Altair is an ancestor to Desmond, the executive (i forgot his name, but lets just call him Bill) puts you into the Animus so he can monitor Altair's memories and find a secret that the Templars need that only Altair know. Once you are in the Animus, you finally play as Altair. You start in a mine looking for a Templar named Roberto, and once you find him, you see he is planning to steal the holy artifact known as the Ark of Covenant. You fail to kill him, and your other Assassins are left to kill him (one of them fails by the way). You go back to your master, Al Mualim, and he finds out about the attack. Suddenly Roberto and his fellow Templars are attacking, and you send a diversion to help. After you send the diversion, they flee, and Al Mualim punishes you because you did not remember the three strict rules to being an Assassin in the earlier mission. He stabs you, and you pass out. You are still alive and you must kill 9 other Templars to redeem yourself and be one of the master Assassins again.The game is overall very good, but there are a few things I did not like. First of all, I know it is set in the First Crusades Period (somewhere around 1000 A.D it started) but Altair cannot hold any type of currency. Your gearand weapons are gained from each of the 9 Templars you kill. Also, in the trailer, Altair is seen to have a crossbow as one of his weapons, but that crossbow is nowhere in the actual game, so that got me dissapointed. Another thing is that youdont carry any types of medicine or potions or things like that, which would be useful in fighting because Altair isnt the best fighter without ALL of his weapons. Speaking of health, you dont have an actual health meter. Your health is displayed in something called a Synchronization Bar, a bar that fills as you do good in the game. If you commit crimes, your Synchronization Bar goes down. If you lose fights, it also goes down. Basically, anything bad makes it go down. Those are basically all the problems i have with this game.To wrap it up, Assassin's Creed is a fun game with a really cool and exciting storyline, not alot of  situations i was mad or angry about, but it is old. The graphics are from somewhere around 2000 (i dont know when the games came out by years). So if you dont mind about graphics and want to have a fun action-adventure game with enticing storyline, Assassin's Creed is the game for you.My Rating: 9/10Note from Author: There is stealth in this game. You will have to blend in with crowds, pickpocket without being caught, and if you are caught by a guard or someone you are pickpocketing, you can go blend in by sitting in a bench, hiding in a haystack, blending in with a group of scholars (they look similar to you in clothing), or just running away until they give up. There is a fourth way to blend in, but I forgot it. Another thing in this game is climbing and parkour. You will have to do alot of that, so be prepared.			",29,2,0,1,2,0,1

												It's a pretty good game and it introduces some neat mechanics, but it's very unpolished. Considering that the game ends with a “to be continued”, you should play it if you're interested in the franchise as a whole, but I'm not sure how strongly I'd recommend it by itself. It's a great launching point for a franchise and does some cool new things but it does have its flaws.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/08/post-launch-reviews-5-assassins-creed.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												Fun Game, a bit repetitive and Simple but I like it.The Missions don't give you Money, like in the sequels, but the people thank you, and give you hints about your next big target, I don't know why, but I find that more rewarding than money.It has an interesting story, not the best one but, an interesting one. :)The controls are a bit weird if you've played the sequels before, but for beginners it shouldn't be a problem (except if you're not playing with controller)But it also has its downsides, you can't fast-travel, can't explore the open world after the end of the story and are bound to 1 arsenal of weapons the whole game.I'd recommend this game definetly for all Assassin's Creed Fans and those, who want to become one.But if you're just looking for a Game, that you wan't to play for a long time, you should better take a look at the sequels. :)			",74,8,1,5,7,0,0

												Slightly hampered by a fussy camera and some rough edges around the graphics, this is still a great game. Towns and cities feel alive, the combat and free-running is relatively fluid and mostly good fun, and Altair makes a decent character to play as.It's still worth playing as the story is well-developed and keeps you going, and the gameplay is rewarding when it all works. The second game may still be the best, but this is by no means a poor second place.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game back in 2008, so before the second game had been released. It was pretty damn great then, but now its age really shows. The only thing that's like I remember is the combat, which is somewhat difficult at times. Air assassinations are possible but annoying (want to kill a civillian? here's your chance), stealth is almost nonexistent, and climbing things turns out to be a chore, as Altair takes forever to make his way up buildings.Side quest? What are those? Each time you go to one of the 3 major cities, you have to investigate your target. This comes down to repetitive side quests involving pick pocketing, beating people up for information, eavesdropping, and some other silly missions like collecting flags or killing archers. There's no variety, and you can't cut to the chase (most of them have annoying cutscenes). By the time I was on the last few assassinations, I was doing as little as possible to get through the game. There was no reason to complete everything aside from lengthening your time with the game.The plot and the characters inside the Animus are also very forgettable. Who are these people I'm killing? Why am I killing them? Oh, they're templars. Well that makes sense. But who ARE they? I don't remember any of the names of the 9 people I was tasked to kill aside from the ""big bad"", Robert de Sable. The game doesn't make it a point to try and make the characters memorable. Altair is a bland protagonist. His arrogance is frustrating and his decisions make no sense sometimes, or at least he rarely justifies them. His ""growth"" is only shown in one scene where he reiterates what he was told at the beginning of the game about the Creed. His voice acting also sucks, but that's besides the point.I still recommend this game because it's where the series started, and outside the animus scenes are still interesting. Learning about the fight between the assassins and the templars in the present day, meeting Desmond, etc, are all still worth the time you have to put into the game itself. Will you want to play it again anytime soon? Probably not. In a few years I'll just use wiki pages to refresh my memory on what's important. Now on to the superior sequel.			",218,63,3,15,5,2,9

												The first entry in the Assassin's Creed series is, at best, an okay game. The visuals were great when the game was new and the gameplay was pretty solid--it's just that once you got an hour or two in, you saw pretty much all the gameplay there was! Exploring the Holy Land as a bad♥♥♥♥♥Assassin in a mind-trippingly weird story is pretty gratifying, but the city guards seem to suffer form Criminal Scum disorder at times. If you like your games with weird stories, this is definitely for you; if you can't stand repetition, then you might steer clear of it.			",155,20,0,24,1,1,6

Can get stuck with character doing everything other than what you want him to, but is also at times quite intuitive and it's not really a controller skills game (like Tomb raider used to be).The missions tend to be quite repetitive, each target has a set of optional sub-missions to do first, well all those sub-missions are the same.As the player it's your job to complete the mission in between the stories, it's not a RPGStory is ok, (No spoilers) some of the key elements I thought were quite apparent right from the start,Not goodNot being able to skip scenes, Lots of slow bits, Saving is weird, not sure how it worked but you can’t save where you want as far as i know and considering you can’t skip scenes it makes it all a bit painful.I'd give game  3/5, just a bit slow, character development a bit week but nice scenery  pretty cool jumping the roof tops of old Jerusalem  ",46,6,3,8,10,0,13

												This game is way too repetitive.  You will hear the same dialogue, visit the same cities, listen to long-winded dialogue, climb similar buildings and dive into similar hay piles, over and over again.  Also, Altair is probably the worst assassin ever.  There is nothing stealthy about him.  The game says an assassin must be discrete, but the game encourages you to kill scores of guards in the busiest parts of the cities.  It also doesn't make any sense that Altair can't swim.  There are two good parts to this game-The swordfighting looks cool and feels good to control.  But once you get the counter moves, it becomes pretty hard to die.-The parkour/freerunning is fun.I also hate the beggars, theives, the guys with the turbans, and the drunks.  All they do is get in the way.  If you kill one of them, you lose health.  Yet, they can hit you and block your way without punishment.  That is a very poor game mechanic.			",193,12,1,15,12,0,13

												Its a great game and most of the reviews will attest this. So I'll just skip to the cons:1. Controls - Have you ever played Prince of Persia Warrior Within? well this game is worse than that. And considering you have two ""stances"" available, high profile moves and low profile moves, neither of which is very intuitive or responsive, it's twice as bad.The protagonist will randomly climb walls, jump into water or not grag a ledge. During fight scenes he may completely ignore a defensive stance at the beginning. And some of the combat mechanices like counter (by far the most important one) are flaky at best.And the PC controller neeeds to be selected in the options menu everytime for it to work.2. NPC - There are some deliberately annoying NPCs like beggars, drunks and lunatics that will try their best to get in your way and slow you down. I have no idea why this was included in the gameplay and why so frequently.3. Menu - Its got a menu screen at startup, and a menu screen within the game. Mildly annoying.However a definite must to get onto the AC bandwagon.			",159,49,3,16,13,2,16

												This game was alot of fun.  I was warned that it was very repetitive, but after playing countless mmo's I found it wasnt that bad.   There are 10ish stages.  In each stage you need to scope out the vantage points and rescue some villagers from guards harassing them.  After that you have to help fellow assassins complete missions.  This ends up being the real content of each stage.  Kill, pickpocket, interogate, and travel around across each area (sometimes with a timer).   I had to cheat at the VERY end.  Tricky having you use your assassin abilities while your not playing the assassin.  Why you no run Desmond?If its on sale pick it up.			",135,27,0,26,26,3,12

												Only played around 9 hours so far but is a really awesome game, it feels a little too simplistic and sometimes too easy with instant respawns and if you screw up you can just killl everything with a sword instead of assassin like play so is way too forgiving of mistakes, it feels like a console to PC port game where it has been dumbed down.It can also be a little repetitive.Still a really awesome game and especially for how old it is, is worth the cheap price and one play through atleast.

												The game that started it all.This game probably has the most in depth mechanics aside from AC:II, and eventually got streamlined into other abilites by the time you reach III and Black Flag.  This was one of the early games for the 360 back in the day, and surprisingly still holds up to many other games released today.  The in game simulation of Altair is great and really sets up the rest of the series.  I would highly recommend purchasing this game no matter if it is on sale or not.			",130,13,0,25,19,1,28

												Uneven experienceLet me start by saying that it's difficult to rate this game as some elements are very well done while others feel abandoned. So let's begin from good:The atmosphere that the game delivers when you finish prologue and arrive at the first city is spectacular. The feeling you get runing over the rooftops or through the crowd is amazing and never felt before. The city feels huge and has adequate medieval style atmosphere. The assassinations are the best part of the game as they are rather memorable experiences. Before them you usually see your target doing something horrible that makes him worth dying but when you're done you get to talk to him and you experience different side of the story which makes you think if killing him was worth it. It really makes you think about what's right and wrong and that's something rare in games. And while all that seems like an awesome game the other elements that create atmosphere seem to be weak, especially storyline. The game basically has no storyline at all, you only play to learn some secret in the end which doesn't even feel worth all the trouble. The characters are quite stereotypical too. And while Acre and Damascus feel different, Jerusalem city feels like some mix of the first two.Now to gameplay. The combat is great, you have a hidden blade for stealth, a sword for normal fighting and throwing knives for enemies in distance. That plus your character's parkour skills and you get all you need to feel like an assassin able to infiltrate and escape without enemies detecting you. On the other hand, the challenges you have to do to track down your targets are repetitive, kind of boring and random, not related to your mission or targets at all. What it means is that the game is not only short (took me 11 hours), but also monotonous. Extra challenges in the game like collecting feathers, killing templars feel meaningless as you don't get anything for doing them, plus they're boring.Tech stuff:Graphics are really good for a 2008 game, soundtrack by Jesper Kyd delivers as it should. Controls feel complicated in the begining, but some practice and you're good to go.Overall an alright game, if you've never played other Assassin's Creed games and want to start or try, you should start with this, first one. Gives you amazing experience but unfortunately too short and repetitive.Atmosphere 7.5/10Gameplay 7.5/10Overall 7.5/10			",69,5,0,9,1,0,3

												A great game by Ubisoft! It gives the feel of playing an Assassin and you mission is to change history to bring a better world. The graphics of this game is amazing although its quite an old game now for the franchise. I like how they did the story as well. If you love stealh games, this is something I would recommend. Although some of the side missions may be slightly repetitive, but every person you assassinate will provide a unique play for each level/memory. 7.8/10.			",179,27,2,17,10,2,39

												The Beggining of probably my 2nd favorite series ever.  Assassin's creed is an Open World Stealth, Action, Adventure game. Set in the Holy Land in 1191 A.D.  You are Altair Ibn La Ahad - A member of the Assassin (Hashashin) order. You are a Master Assassin and are the Master's best man. You are an arrogant man and break the three tenants of the Assassin's Creed and are stripped of your rank and forced to go out and kill 9 Targets and will discover a dark and deadly secret as you do this. You can Free Run up buildings, fight with your sword, assassinate with your hidden blade and fight with your fists among several other fun features. During the present day you are Desmond Miles a former Assassin brought to a top secret facility of Abstergo industries. Thats all i can really tell without Major spoilers for things that will affect our experience dfrasticaly and make it much less fun for you the first time. For £10 this game is amazing value and you can spend dozens of hours in the story, exploring the cities, and doing just random stuff. Sadly there is no Multiplayer in this title but there is later in the series. The reason I have 4 hours playtime is because I just brought this on steam but i had it on Playstation 3. So I highly reccomend this game. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gameplay is very lacking and unrefined when compared to *similar* games like Arkham Asylum/City and/or the latest Tomb Raider. However, as a starter to the fantastic Assassin's Creed series, it is simly one of those must-play games.			",142,9,1,11,16,0,5

But what the ♥♥♥♥ do they know? You're just going to kill them. You also get to play with birds as in you go and stalk them and then look around and then fly off buildings. Awww yeah.

												The controls are a bit clunky as it was clearly designed for consoles. I could not adapt with a keyboard + mouse to play the game. So I had to use a gamepad (which is downpoint for me) but eventually you get used to it. Storywise, it is a great game though it flaws in it's development. It feels raw. After the 4th assassination you'll eventually get bored. I only kept up with it because of the gorgeous level designs and the obvious need of closure.I'd give this game a 7,5 out of 10.

												It's too bad that people get to know the more recent AC games before this one. When they decide to explore the first game of the franchise, they find it boring and repetitive. I was lucky enough to play it at the time it was released, and I found it to be a unique, engaging, GORGEOUS game, with an extremely well-written and intelligent theme. Sure, it's a bit repetitive, but building each individual assassination and carrying them out as a true assassin should is very rewarding. It's too bad that the following games in the franchise stopped urging the player to seek alternative ways to kill their targets, 'cause that's something Assassin's Creed does right.

												The original Assassin's Creed game is what started a franchise that can be recognized almost anywhere. I honsetly believe it was this game that served as the catalyst to boost Ubisoft Montreal into creating the multiple other AC games.I wanted to include my own story overview, because in my opinion you'll want to play this game because of the gameplay (Parkour, Freerunning, Combat) first and the storyline second. This isn't because I thought the story was bad-- it is just the least interesting in the series. However this story was what started the Assassin's Creed lore and, well, Creed.You start off by waking up inside a machine known as ""The Animus"", a device developed by a company called ""Abstergo"". To be more clear 'you' are Desmond Miles, a young man who claims to be a bartender. Abstergo kidnapped Desmond as a means to probe him with the Animus to recover memories of his ancestors, which would lead them to something (something of value) that was lost to time (as Assassin's Creed I is set during the Crusades, in 1191 AD). Once inside the Animus, you play as Altair, a master Assassin who loses everything he built up in the Brotherhood by breaking key Tenents set by the Order's leader, Al Maulim, and Assassins from a previous age. Abstergo follows the memories of Altair, searching for a device created by unknown people (speculated to be supernatural beings) that has the ability to control the minds of others. Towards the middle of the story Desmond realizes what is happening, that the company called Abstergo is actully run by Templar Knights, who are still bent on ending the war waged by Assassins and Templars, even after a thousand years, by using the Apple (as the mind-control device is called). So does Desmond or Altair do something about it? You'll have to buy this game and play it to find out.Beyond Story, this game has very nice gameplay and graphics for a game made in 2007-2008. I can still consider it a Next Gen game, as the details and cinematics are very well done. This game isn't seamless, as you have to load every time you change locations-- thats another thing: While this game is tagged as ""Open World"", the game is devised to give you the first few levels complete control over where you go. After this, you can quickly travel between the main cities in the game; Masyaf, Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus. The area in between these places is called Kingdom on the map. You can always travel through Kingdom, but you always have the option to teleport to the cities' outskirts after you return to Al Maulim at Masyaf. This game, in this case, becomes both Open World, and Linear. But because this is a small detail, it doesn't really add up as a problem in-game. Parkour is always fun in AC, as you can freerun up any place so long as there are handholds of ledges to hold onto. The game's ""Leap of Faith"" idea wasn't bad, but it makes the game seem unrealistic in my opinion, not that this game should sound ""real"" at all. Basically a Leap of Faith is when you climb up onto a veiwpoint, spy your surroundngs, then leap down into a nearby haystack. Its a very fun feature, but looks very impossible. Ignoring the aesthetics of the Leap of Faith, it's a great way to get players to explore without feeling rushed. You don't just walk around and unlock map bits. You have to climb up and look around to know where to go. This is also great because you don't complete missions if you don't explore-- you have to complete three side-quests before the target is avaliable to kill. So viewpoints and Leaps of Faith are very much-- gameplay wise-- critical.I've played Assassin's Creed through once now. It can go quick if you want it to, or rush through it to do the most important thing you can possibly do once you complete AC1-- play the next game.I give this game a 8/10, because its fun to play, but just ends too quickly!

												Assassin's creed is a wonderful adventure game. The enviroment in this game is very realistic and pretty. The game story is very intresting that you sometimes don't want to quit the game. I also like the gameplay itself that you can climp up buildings and jump from roof to roof. The combats are a bit difficult in the beginning but you will lern pretty quickly how to do. I hope when I buy AC 2 that it is even better than the first one.			",98,3,2,14,14,0,19

												Gameplay: The game offers numerous options, ranging from stealth, sword-fighting, hand to hand combat, parkour, horse riding and exploring. All of these options are well done, however horse riding is the weakest aspect.Story: The story is quite strong, however the moden-day sections feel unecessary.Graphics: The graphics are very detailed, in particular the cities. Also, there are many unique NPC's, which helps to draw you into the intricately detailed areas.Sound: Consistent to the time period the game is set in, with appropriate music, dialogue and ambient noise.Re-playability: There are many collectables and lots of optional content, though some of it can be tedious.

												When I first played this game, I was very disappointed. First of all, I wasn't playing Ezio, which really bugged me because I knew nothing about the other assassins; second, I was VERY confused by the way they incorporated the Animus into the game, and had you switch between history and modern times. And finally, it can be pretty damn frustrating to have to walk across an entire city to simply avoid alerting guards; those cities are huge, man! But after I was about half-way through, I began to appreciate it. Altair is, in fact, a really bad♥♥♥♥♥assassin, and the switch between modernity and history actually makes more sense in this game than it does in the others. Though you need to be a paitent player to enjoy this game, I think it was worth every hour I put into it.			",167,9,0,9,8,2,26

Not only Ezio's story, but also Mr. Miles', since there are some extra actions that can be done outside the Animus.The fights, limited at the beggining of the game, become more challenging near its end, with some ""boss"" fights that are kinda enjoyable.Good game, great saga, highly recommended.

												After trying this one out a couple years ago, I came to it slightly more mature and with an xbox 360 controller. What a treat it was. Although some really didn't like the modern but virtual-assassin setting, I didn't find it too annoying and actually thought it somewhat intriguing. To me, the highlights of this game are its' graphics, combat, and historical atmosphere and setting. The world is bright and the animations extremely fluid. Speaking of fluid, so is the combat as you assassinate one enemy after another executing counters and sweet but brutal combos. If you're a history fan, this game also has a rich historical atmosphere and storyline to follow, although it's basically completely fictional. I picked this game up for $3 and got 20 very enjoyable hours out of it. Not too bad at all. 8.6/10.			",204,20,5,17,10,0,34

												A revolution in 3rd person gaming. Truly extraordinary for its' time. Obviously high quality as it led to a series of sequels that has since turned into one of the most successful franchises in gaming history. That aside there are several components of AC1 that have not aged well. The missions are woefully repetative. Go to a new city, find all the viewpoints, ""gather information"" by doing the exacty same side quests over and over again, etc etc. After the first 4 hours the latter 16 hours are pretty much the same thing on repeat until you get to the end. And to describe the ending, all that can be said is ""Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!"". Then you wake up as Desmond feeling really satisfied and the game ends in the middle of more stuff happening that you don't get to explore. Overall 8/10 for its time. Today? 6.5 out of 10. TL:DR Just start the series off with AC 2			",228,44,1,32,48,1,39

												One of the classics from the early 360/PS3 era. You play as Desmond, a test subject for a mysterious project which involves the use of a machine called ""The Animus"". The Animus transports the subject into the body of any ancestor from the subject's bloodline, via genetic memory. Altair is the ancestor of choice in this game. There's so much running and jumping it'll make you want to take up parkour. The animation is beautiful as well as the worlds. The worlds are so impressive, visiting places like Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, each having it's own distinct feel and design. Certainly a work of art. Buy it, play it, love it.

												Bad points first - The missions are almost identical, turn up, do minimum of three from a mostly boring selection of mini assassination missions, collecting flags, eavesdropping, pickpocketing etc, get the go ahead to assassinate the 'boss', see your leader for an upgrade, rinse and repeat. Some of the tasks weren't worth including, eavesdropping for example is sitting on the nearest bench and pressing a button. The 'kingdon' between cities was a wasted opportunity and may as well be skipped unless you're looking for flags and templars. The assassinations themselves can rarely be carried out in the delicate stealthy way you might imagine, more often than not you end up fighting half a dozen or more to get away to a rooftop. The mental people and beggars get annoying quickly with the same sound clips over and over again so I ended up spending most of the game on the rooftops to avoid them, missing out on a lot of the city and feel at ground level. The Desmond parts could have included more backstory and the two doctors got boring quickly. Good - Looks great, I bought it in a sale last year and for a game so old it looks superb. The free running is well executed and something I never got bored of, nothing like seeing two or three steps ahead when running away from guards across the rooftops. Because it can be had so cheaply in sales, and if you take the fastest route possible completed in a handful of hours I would recommend it as part of the AC saga.			",52,1,1,4,0,0,18

												Back when this game came out, it was a breakthrough in game ideas, but nowadays, it's rather simplistic.  Time and again the player explores one of 3 sections of a couple of cities, synchronizing at viewpoints to locate the same menial tasks over and over so they can play the one significant mission of the segment.  The story lasts around 8 hours, so when this game is on sale, you'll definitely get your money's worth, but otherwise I wouldn't call it worthwhile.  For newcomers to the series, it's not necessary to play this game to understand the rest.			",103,7,0,19,7,0,8

While the game's biggest issue is repetitive gameplay, the story, combat and movement mechanics, sound, and graphical style kept me coming back again and again, anxious to see the battle between Assassins and Templars to the very end.  Assassin's Creed is a sci-fi conspiracy theorist's fantasy with an interesting injection of historical fiction and definitely worth checking out.			",422,66,7,59,14,3,50

The other games are tied up in a needlessly complex control scheme that fits console controllers and they've just added more and more ""stuff"" outside of the central storyline. This game has the right amount of stuff to do, and it has a legitimately interesting storyline.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A wonderful game! It was really addicting as i beat it in 3 sittings. The story was great. The cities that you climb around are amazing. The characters are intriguing. The sounds are fun. The Ai can be stupid at times and jump off buildings when they are chasing you. The graphics are great! The gameplay is alot of fun. The sword fighting could be improved but it is still fun. It is a great adventure game that keeps you wanting more in the end. There is alot of things to do in the game. It is a great game if you can get your hands on it. If you ever see this in the price range that is great for you then don't hesitate to get it because you wont regret it. Its a great game!			",3039,1134,139,314,429,33,476

												I had played this game a few years back, but now decided to give it another shot. It can certainly still compete with today's games, especially from a graphics standpoint, which is, in itself, quite remarkable.If you have never played this game, I would call it a merger between Splinter Cell, Batman and Hitman. You have to blend into your environment and hide at times, you have to navigate rooftops, you can be a vigilante, and you have your mission to complete and have a certain freedom on how to do so. While this game is certainly not as refined as its successors in the series, it was, much like the first Splinter Cell, the first Batman (Arkham series), and the first Hitman, a diamond in the rough, with exceptional gameplay, graphics and design. At least for their respective times. While the subsequent titles had a lot of refinement and improvement, this first Assassin's Creed still stands its ground in the sands of time. Add to that the soundtrack, and you have great entertainment.The only downside - to me - is the obvious console breeding ground, and the somewhat shady save point situation, but I guess that's the way it is. I'm getting used to the whole checkpoint idea these days, albeit with a heavy heart. I do miss my quick save option.Either way, give this game a try, especially if you can snap it up in a deal! You won't regret it if you like the other games mentioned above. Also, it's not as repetitive as people say; while the handling is, true, the way you approach diverse challenges isn't.

												Assassin's Creed can be vaguely compared to the concept of 'The Matrix' in which you play a protagonist in the 'real world' who becomes someone else inside a 'virtual world'. It tells a fictional story of a war between Assassins and Templars - and spans across several real life historic periods. The franchise is one of few - which tells a massive story back-to-back instead of switching main characters half way through or making massive time jumps. Awesome franchise!			",376,87,11,48,43,0,73

It also have its bugs and gliches, repetitivnes of quests is kinda annoying but the main storyline is quite good if you disregard constant misions ""save the citzen"" or some other thet you do over and over again. But you must not forget that this is the first game in the AC franchise and so it is a bit unpolished and its sequels ar better in one more aspects, but again not all agree on this question. I give it 8/10 and say you have to at leaste try it to judge it.			",29,3,1,10,9,0,5

												I think the game has a lot to offer. Psuedo-open world, side quests and objectives, nice graphics for its time and decent mechanics. However, it just could not hold my interest. Most of my time played on this game was it running in the background while I alt-tabbed to do other things. I got it because I was given the latest version (Black Flag) as a bundle for something else I bought and thought I should play through the series as to understand the entirety of the story.Alas, I'll probably never get around to finishing this game or ever playing its successors.I do think a lot of people will get enjoyment out of the game, even if I didn't and as such would recommend it.

Running across rooftops is incredibly fun. The storyline is immersive, compelling, and makes good sense, with alot of intruige and mystery mixed in. Learn the skills of an asassin, find your target, study the situation, learn information out on the streets, and let your blade find their throat. While you are mostly invincible if you play it right, you can end up needing to re synch with the genetic memories if you do anything too foolish.

												Okay. Here's the deal with Assassin's Creed. It's a really great jigsaw puzzle that somebody put together all wrong. It's a little bit like God of War, but don't think you'll like it because you liked God of War.I don't know. I don't want to hate on it, because I really do like it. It's a fun game. There are just things about it that don't make sense. For example: riding your horse past soldiers at high speed makes them chase you.And it's not like they chase you, catch you, then you have a conversation like ""you shouldn't ride so fast on the highway."" They chase you, they catch you, they kill you. because you were galloping down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ highway. The idea of the game and the story of it are really, really cool. But the game itself is a little bit hard to play because of things like that. But I maintain my former opinion: try it and you might like it, because this is actually a good game. It's just got it's little quirks.Get the demo and see if you like it.			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												Being the first of this awesome series, it's totally worth playing.The game itself has some things that displeases me, such as the fact it is really repetitious and has some unnecessary cutscenes (after half of the game, checking Eagle Points and listening to the rescued citizens become very annoying).But besides these ""bad things"" (IMO), the plot, the scenario and everything related to the story itself are more than satisfactory. Not only Ezio's story, but also Mr. Miles', since there are some extra actions that can be done outside the Animus.The fights, limited at the beggining of the game, become more challenging near its end, with some ""boss"" fights that are kinda enjoyable.Good game, great saga, highly recommended.

												The original Assassin's Creed has set new boundaries for the adventure genre. The parkour and the overall gameplay are simply impressive for a 2008 game.I've only played this game in 2014 because I wanted to get into the AC series and figured AC1 was the first step I should take. Although it is EXTREMELY repetitive, it's a game I'm willing to finish 100% if I ever have the time. If not, I'll just complete the Story.It's worth adding that, although I have not reached the game's ending, I've already found a plethora of collectibles. Be it small flags or side missions, this game has a lot of that kind of extras.All in all, AC1, despite lacking in variety, has re-defined the adventure/action genre in a way that is yet to be seen in any other game outside of the AC series. Or so I think.			",116,67,2,11,5,0,3

												This is probably the worst game in the series.  The controls are trash with Altair randomly jumping to things you don't want to and falling off ledges when you jump half the time.  You die when you enter water deep enough to swim in.   Game progression is repetitive.  Game crashes at random points.  You can't escape guards unless you hide in a haybale or similar bulls**t or traveling by horse 500 units.  Guards will randomly start to chase you and the crowd of guards will do nothing but get bigger.  I hate the f*****g beggars and other r******d homeless that hit you, not a major problem but an extreme annoyance to me.  No Steam Acheivements. Overall 4/10 because sure the story was alright but the way you progressed is pretty boring.  I would only recommend this if you wanted to experience the beginging of the storyline.

												This is a pretty good game. There are other games in the series that are much better but this is where it all began. While the controls and visuals are a bit dated and the story is very basic, the idea of living the life of your ancestors through the Animus is very thought-provoking and the time period this game explores is probably the most interesting out of the ones explored in the series to date.

												For a 2007 game I was pleasantly suprised, the storyline was great! Game mechanics were limited but tbh I wasn't really expecting too much from the game when I bought it. Late to the party but I really hope the stories of the next few games are just as good.			",7,1,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want a game that succeeds very well at being mediocre, play any other in this series.If you want a game that's an interesting failure, willing to serve its own vision before pandering to the widest playerbase, play this one.Is it tedious at times? Yes, certainly. Will you feel confusion, even dismay, at some of the choices the designers made? Probably.Better, though, to have flaws in something interesting, than a perfectly crafted empty spectacle.			",219,36,1,35,18,2,38

												To start this review off, let me say that I am a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise. Even considering some missteps, concerning the latest direction the games have taken, I will still look at AC games through rose-coloured glasses. Except the first game of the franchise, that is.It is the game that introduces us to the overarching plot of Templars versus Assassins. This is all very interesting and Desmond seems kind of cool. The way of how this story is told is also innovative and cool. Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, however, who is the 'real' protagonist of the game, is bland to say the least. The way he is written, does not allow the player to easily identify with him and thus makes him a bit annoying.Gameplay-wise the game suffers from some very annoying problems as well. The jumping and climbing, which has become a trademark for the AC franchise, is not that polished in the first game. Very often jumps do not work out as planned and the stealth can sometimes be hindered by exactly those quirks. Furthermore, the missions are extremely repetetive and the travel-system in this game is god-awful.For anyone, who wants to get into the AC series: Do yourself a favour and skip this one. There are tons of videos that give you a summary of the story, so that you can get into the second game, without having missed anything from Desmond's story. Keep your hands off this one, jump into the next one and fall in love.			",252,101,2,25,23,3,41

												I must say very impressive. This game was a lot of fun. I judged it too quickly , I had it for a while, and decided after watching a playthrough of a few levels on youtube I decided maybe I was too hasty. I redownloaded the game and really had a great time. The game can be used with a keyboard... but you will either A. Kill your keyboard or B. Kill your hand. Whichever comes first. I was never good with gamepads but after my hand began to hurt with frustation, I pulled out my pad and really REALLY benefited from it. The Game makes it easy too, since the circles in the upper right mirror the layout of your controller, and change accordingly it allowed me to easily adapt and in doing so become a much better assassin haha. Anyhow highly recommend this game.			",196,29,4,11,4,0,12

												In the first Assassin's Creed game you're the boring dude (Desmond) who's been kidnapped and is forced to lie the hell down and run around in a virtual reality as his assassin ancestor Altair, because the modern day moe'suckra Templars want information from your tiny baby brain memory.This game is as good as the second game but in it's own way. I feel a bit more like an assassin in this one (though he still looks a bit out of place), the combat is more of a challenge and assassinating people is generally harder. There isn't as much side stuff to do just the flag collecting thing, and those other 3 optional missions you can do when you're finding information for each assassination memory.You can't change your clothes and armour and you are given weapons when the game says so. You also have alot less weapons than Ezio and you don't get as much help. Overall it's just more challenging but it feels like a bigger achievement when you kill them dudes good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original Assassin's Creed has set new boundaries for the adventure genre. The parkour and the overall gameplay are simply impressive for a 2008 game.I've only played this game in 2014 because I wanted to get into the AC series and figured AC1 was the first step I should take. Although it is EXTREMELY repetitive, it's a game I'm willing to finish 100% if I ever have the time. If not, I'll just complete the Story.It's worth adding that, although I have not reached the game's ending, I've already found a plethora of collectibles. Be it small flags or side missions, this game has a lot of that kind of extras.All in all, AC1, despite lacking in variety, has re-defined the adventure/action genre in a way that is yet to be seen in any other game outside of the AC series. Or so I think.			",116,67,2,11,5,0,3

At times felt like I was forcing myself to play. But I did enjoy the story and that’s what kept me going. If you have played the others, there’s not need to play this, but only for the story. It should also be noted that I didn’t play on PC but on PS3.			",255,57,3,16,16,7,16

												Ahhh, assassin's creed! No numbers after that, no other names like Syndicate or Unity! Just it: Assassin's creed. The good old times right?Assassin's creed is not a masterpiece, but is pretty fun and enjoyable.Starting with the flaws:- The gameplay is repetitive; ""Come to a city, hear a conversation, interrogate someone... repeat""; This is his major flaw. If you don't have the patience: DON'T play this game. It can be really frustrating. I was starting to be sick of the same missions on the middle of the game. However, if you have patience, it can be pretty fun. (if not, start in ac2)- Repetitive dialogues and characters (people on the street). I swear that i killed the same guy at least 5 times.- Exiting the game requires movement through 3 or more menu screens;- Limited incentive to explore and collect;- No replay value;Don't let his flaws distract you from the good game that he can be:+ Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous;+ The environments are credible in their attempt to recreate an historical period.+ Voice-acting is excellent; general sound-design too and is strikingly original;+ Good UI;+ Quick-travel available;+ Good ad enjoyable history;+ Combat is good and cinematic;+ Killing a target involves a series of different missions; They are unvaried but adds for immersion.In general, Assassin's creed is a decent game. It's not as good as the sequel, but you should play it.7.5/10			",24,0,0,0,2,0,1

												Relatively easy to beat. Combat is decent. They were really confident in making a sequeal/many sequeals, because there is no ""definite"" ending to this game.Pros: Free-running, amazing kills and an interesting storyline. Cons: Funny AI, some bugs and ""eagle eye"" is the worse vision feature I have ever seen. Historical inaccuracies.The idea of assassinating people is to kill a few, to saves the lives of many. Ironically, there are many cases in which you kill like a GAZILLION soldiers to save ONE poor civilian. I have probably killed about a few hundred guards in a city of a few thousands [Jerusalem] but I guess it's still less than 0.1% so thats' okay. Makes you wonder who is right after all. Still, ""Nothing is true, everything is permitted"", so even the creed can be cast away once awhile.Overall, It's a good game. Would recomend.			",82,7,0,13,9,0,4

												Assassin's Creed is all about spending ages gathering information on your targets, using it to devise a plan to get in, make the kill and get out, then see it all go horribly wrong in a split second and end up winging it anyway. But that just makes it all the sweeter when you do execute a plan perfectly.Basically Metal Gear Solid with free running during the Crusades. It can drag a bit going through all of the information gathering challenges, but the assassinations just about make up for it.			",107,15,0,18,5,0,8

However, after the third or forth mission you really noticed that you always to the exact same thing. I really had to force myself through the last few missions. The ending on the other hand was great and made up for the last few hours spend doing the same thing over and over again.

												The game that spawned a whole new series and brought a new meaning to gaming.Assassin's Creed is one of the best games of it's era. Relatively large open-world maps to explore, story-rich, excellent voice acting and animation, the only thing that this game lacks is a monetary and item purchase system that would later be implemented in Assassin's Creed II.Another, let's say, weak point of the game is its repetitivity: at some point in the game, you'll find yourself doing the same things over and over again: find something, go beat up some dude, follow another dude, steal a dude's letter, and so on.TLDR: a must-have for any Assassin's Creed fan.

If you're lucky, and have a big amount of hp, you don't die, otherwise, you just start from where you took a flag, or synchronized.The 40th King Richard flag, has all of a sudden gotten even more impossible to get. 20+ tries before I moved on. It cannot be taken. Tried different positions before running off. Even tried going from the flag above to see if it did anything different, but unfortunately not.If you're one of those players that want's to collect everything in AC1, then PLEASE, for your good, don't play the steam version			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Picked this up on sale and can't say I am disappointed. Graphics not bad for a 5+ year old game and worked with my controller. Great story and enjoy exploring the world.cons-controls can be Clunky/touchy at times but the game is forgiving-engaging in battle can be fun taking out as many with one shot as possible, but once your in combat with sword it can be a little lackluster-can be a bit repetitive, especially if you do all the side quests.

												Refreshing Game as i am new to the AC series. I wanted to play the entire series from start to finish and what a way to start. It is almost a complete game for me, I am familiar with other reviews this game has received and some negativity. But you hardly notice any fault as you play this game. Its a lot of fun, and it is what i look for in games such as this. A lot of climbing and jumping, the fighting mechanics is awesome compared to other games. I can go on for hours with the good.A few bad points;1. Running into people, may loose control of player.2. Cut away scenes get annoying after a while.3. Player jumps onto walls repeatedly gets annoying as it makes no progress climbing.Get this game if you like to have fun. Something they forgot about in AC Unity			",21,1,2,1,2,1,0

												At first I really loved the game. The controls were good, the story intriguing and the graphics just awesome. Until half of the game I just couldn't stop... well, then came the other half. I won't lie to you, I didn't like it so much after the first half, mainly because it then was just the same things over and over again. Running around the city, fullfilling your tasks which also were the same (and I really hated the market stand quests... frustrating s***)... so yeah. At some point I only asked myself ""when is it gonna be over?""But, as I mentioned before, beautiful settings, mind-blowing story, cool stuff you can do and it really makes fun to stroll around the diverse cities. I know most gamers love this game, myself... not so much, but it is still a very good video game title that you should definately should check out at some point or another.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After finishing the game the first time, I thought I'd never play it again, but here not 1-2 months later, I played it through again.It's simple and yet elegant. The quests are all the same, but I still liked going through them because the combat is very good. In the 2nd game I did better because I mastered more moves. I owned this a long time ago on PS3 and could never get the controls right, but I bought it for the computer and computer controls for fighting is what I grew up on. I got to where I'd have 20-30 guards coming at me and I would own them. Run from the guards? Blend? Why? I just cut through them after I got counter moves. And after I mastered breaking grab, I really was almost unstoppable.If I could ever figure out how to counter the templay combo move that ends up with a throat punch, I'd probably never lose a fight.It is a great game.

But, the story is very simple: go to assassin bureu, find information about the target, kill the target, listen their conversation, escape the city, hiding in assassin bureu, back to Masyaf, and do it over and over again. Also there are no minimap so you need to open map every time u lost. i reccomended u to buy this game but, make sure u have a compass if you wanna play this game.			",13,2,0,0,0,0,0

												First I want to start off with no Uplay!The first Assassins Creed game is personally one of my more favorite of the AC titles next to 2, but this game isnt the second and im not going to compare them, im just going to say my honest opinion on this version.To start i really like the whole concept of this taking place in the middle ages, the idea of fighting knights in armour with awesome kill cinematics back in the day for me was sweet! Sprinting over roof tops tossing throwing knives at anyone standing in my way was very entertaining. Personally I really like the whole AC story line even though it confuses the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me at times.On the downside i found the controls when trying to traverse over water areas to be a little touchy and spent a solid half hour drowning, as you progress further into the game the guards are more and more likely to attack you for no reason which albiet is understandable at that point but the running mechanics well they tend to fail you, considering you got like 10 some odd guards chasing you, but even so thats not too bad heyre easy to kill.Lastly the thing i hated the most and always will is those ♥♥♥♥ing beggars! holy♥♥♥♥♥♥i killed soooo many of them i dont care theyre anoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥and constantly block you at the worst times. ♥♥♥♥♥ i know your homeless but I dont want this sword going up my♥♥♥♥♥To surmize this is a really good game and personally if your going to play the series i recommend this one first just for the story if not anything else.9.1/10 would stab beggars again.

												Pros1. The game is very well designed and beautiful.2. As the difficulty level ramps up, there are tutorials for you to practice within the game in a realistic way.3. The game gets progressively harder in a manageable way, until the end.4. The missions are challenging and interesting, especially early on.5. The sword fighting is pretty realistic.Cons1. The game gets tedious after the fourth or fifth major mission. Each new city seems to have the exact same tasks with a big assassination at the end.2. Some side missions seems pointless (especially collecting all the flags).			",116,6,4,9,9,0,2

												I don't know how to put it into the right words, but i'm utterly disappointed.I'd normaly not write a evaluation of a game i played only for such a short time, but i have never encountered such a strong difference between general opinion and my experiences.After playing it for a couple of hours, i had to put it aside because i was so annoyed by this game.Controls are 100% console, which means with mouse+keyboard you are in danger to create a knot of your fingers, lol.This games system of control may work superb on a console but it's almost unplayable on PC imo.For example, changes between stealth and not stealth mode are barely noticeable (UI) which can result in a chaotic brawl with several guards. I could get used to this without problem but the constant changes between present and medieval times completely kill the immersion for me and the futuristic UI doesn't help getting immersed into the medieval ages. Nor do the continuing jumps in the storyline help creating a feel for the game world. I have no idea if it changes later in the game, but i don't have the desire to find that out. ",22,6,0,10,8,0,2

												Why are people reviewing this in 2015? Most of the negative reviews are from people playing it years later. The video game industry has evolved and improved a lot since 2008 and no matter what anyone says this game was revolutionary.I guess if you didn't play it back in 2008 and are only picking it up now, then it doesn't really have as much gameplay as Black Flag for example, but that doesn't make it a lesser game. Very few people can pick up Super Mario 64 or Unreal Tournament today having never played it before, and find it amazing. That's just how it is. The gameplay for the later Assassin's Creed games only got better because this was the foundation and they built from there. This is my favourite Assassin's Creed game and it shouldn't be overlooked.			",44,5,0,6,6,0,4

The graphics are top notch and the animations are very well done.Didn't finish the flag challanges, 100 flags spread out on a map is more tedious than fun.  If it had been 20 or 30 I would have done it... but 100?  No thanks.Also some of the camera angles are a bit annoying.  Especially when you save someone the camera focuses on that person and than then vigalantes who show up making a fast get away kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Great animations though and the atmosphere is well worth the price.

The theme is extremely cool and the parkour is fun but the game is too repetitive and gets boring quickly (the sidequests don't help at all).The sci-fi sections are dumb and the history parts are always the same: go here, kill him, beat up him, steal from him, sit on a bench and listen to him... awwwwThe game gets interesting towards the end though and there are some great philosophical thoughts in AC but the gameplay is just too repetitive which makes the game feel like a chore.

												Assassin's creed is a great starter for the AC series, set during The Third Crusade you play as Altaïr Ibn La'Ahad (translates to: The Bird, Son of Noone) a master assassin of the brotherhood who breaks all three tenants of the assassins' creed and is dishonored. Loosing all your weapons and ranks you assassinate targets to have Ubisoft spoon feed you counter attacks and new weapons. Great storyline, the cutscenes could use some work as the player can walk around during the cutscenes which kind of breaks some of them. The parkour is great with one exception, sometimes when leaping off of buildings or cliffs the player hits an invisible wall and slides down it to the ground, the parkour is also notably slower than in other Assassin's Creed games. The controls are built for the console meaining that it does have speep learning curve, example: holding down right click to toggle high profile shift to drop and right click plus w plus space to freerun. the game features great graphics (given that it is from 2008) although some of the textures glitch every once and a while.Overall I would give this game a 8/10			",86,3,2,10,2,0,2

												Wow, I've never picked a game in this series up until now.  In a way, it's amazing this series took off.  It's a great idea, a wonderful gameplay conceit that allows it to be ""gamey"" via an in-game explanation (the Animus).  The story is good, like a Dan Brown novel.  The gameplay is tight and refined, considering it's the first entry in the long-running series, and the graphics are decent considering the age.  All that said, it's amazing it all ever went anywhere as horribly repetive and rote the game becomes about halfway through!  Unless you purposefully break the monotony by doing optional tasks, it's basically a rinse-n-repeat of go to this town, do 2 or 3 information gathering tasks, kill a guy.  It wouldn't be so bad if it were an 8-hour game, but it's probably more like 15.  I couldn't keep doing it.  I skipped to AC2.  Recommended only if you must see how the series started, but otherwise, skip it, the sequels are much better, and watch a Youtube video of the story segments in this game to fill in the gaps.

												I originally played this game in 2007 when my dad bought it for me and my sister on a whim for our Xbox 360. I remember being infinitely furious at this game at many points, and certainly having to take a good amount of breaks for how difficult certain parts of the game can get. However, I immediately bought this 8 years later upon seeing it on the Steam market, and here's why:-The furiousness built up in this game made it such a huge relief to actually complete *that* mission or find *that* flag/templar. -Even though the whole game is summed up at the start of AC2, this game really teaches you a lot about Desmond, the Templars, and adds a depth to the whole series that you really can't get by skipping this game.-Altair is a f***ing badass.-The missions are repetitive (which you already know if you've read ANY review of this game) but the storyline makes all the extra time doing the same mission ten times in different cities worth it.-There is a lot of bonus stuff and lore you can find in the modern day portions, which I think made the game much more enjoyable. I HATED not being able to leave the Animus in AC2 except for the specified sequences for, respectable, halfway through and the end.All in all, I give this game a solid 8/10. I would (and probably will) definitely play through this game at least two more times. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I could get used to this without problem but the constant changes between present and medieval times completely kill the immersion for me and the futuristic UI doesn't help getting immersed into the medieval ages. Nor do the continuing jumps in the storyline help creating a feel for the game world. I have no idea if it changes later in the game, but i don't have the desire to find that out. ",22,6,0,10,8,0,2

												I really don't get why this series is so popular. You open it, it's fun, you're doing cool things, then you unlock counter-attack and you realize that with counter-attack you can easily kill however many people the game throws at you rather than the combo, which you can almost never get right. But you keep on going, since sure it's the same combat mechanism repeated but that's not too bad. And you realize you're not playing a game, you're playing a set of minigames. Every mission is more of les the same, the places are pretty much the same. You spend your time running on rooftops to get to your destination to avoid the tedium of walking. And it offers a bit of enjoyment, until you're tired of climbing the n'th tower to find the next set of identical missions.Sure some things in the game require skill, but it's so tedius. Everything is just a facsimile of a fun thing to do and nothing actually holds up. Compare against say, Mirror's Edgge, that makes an interesting parkourgame that is actually fun. Much better than a random masked guy saying, hey buddy run after these flags for me.When I bought it, I had heard so many good things about the game, that I thought I'd like it,so I bought 2 and Bortherhood alongside it. After starting the first one, I didn't even bother finishing it or installing the rest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												3/10 - One of the worst games I have ever played. There are some cool mechanics in it - I cant deny that but after a while (and this moment comes very quick) it  becomes VERY boring. It is also way too simple and contains a lot of bugs (you can fall under map or you can have situation when you cant trigger cutscene). The worst part is the ending - last chapter is non-stop fighting that looks like this: defeat 5 guys, watch cutscene, defeat 10 new guys, watch another cutscene - it goes like that at least 10 times :S DO NOT BUY IT, DO NOT PLAY IT EVEN IF YOU SOMEHOW GET THIS FOR FREE. STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. EACH TIME YOU TURN THIS ON GOD KILLS A KITTEN SO BE AWARE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's really important that you get ALL the flags and kill ALL the templars in this or you won't get the extra cutscene or bonus weapon at the end. The four hours I spent getting everything was totally not a waste of time at all. Totally not a waste of time. Did I say that twice? I must be tired from all that extremely necessary time I spent getting the very important flags and templars and watching that awesome bonus cutscene. Overall: 7.314159265/10 - maybe not ""The work...of a mastarrrr"" as that guy in the combat arena loved saying many times, but was still a fun experience. Play for the story. AC2 is definitely better.Pros: interesting and engaging story with a twist, still looks great for such an old game, some interesting voice actingCons: repetitive side-missions in gathering information about your targets, combat is a bit clunky and lacks depth. A master assassin also does not know how to swim and instantly drowns upon touching water. ",87,5,2,18,4,0,5

												Assassin's Creed 1 is definitely a great game. If you do have some time to play, try playing it first through Black Flag, you certainly will understand a whole lot of things. For me, it's a great game, and you could totally see how much the game has changed over the years. a/ The story plot: is nice, the way the game alternates and lets you pause between the Memory Blocks (which is pieces of the story of Altair), is great. b/ The combat: is simple, but effective. It was a little bit too boring at first, but once you get the ability to Counter Kill, things start getting much better. But you will have to be patient til' that part, believe me. c/ The missions: are nice, but to be honest, as mentioned by a lot of articles and reviews, they are repetitive in general. Every city you enter, you will have to go check out every viewpoint, rescue every cititzen in ""harassing"" trouble, do some interrogation, meeting your Hashassin guild mates to do some jobs for them, eavesdropping people talking, pickpocketing; you will even have to do some ""Flag finding running"" too. Doing all that and you'll be able to access the ""Assassinating your target"" part. d/ The stealth gameplay: is nice, but since this is the first game, compared to the sequels, you won't feel much of the stealth mechanism, most of the time you will have to do some combat, against 7-8 guys all at the same time (you will start noticing this after getting that Counter Kill ability).e/ One of the things I like about this game, is the fact that it doesn't require you to collect all additional ""flags"" to unlock the ending. Not at all, so don't you worry, just enjoy your game, do as much as you can. The side quests will be repetitively boring, but even the conversations with each of the Hashassin guild mate are different!, so you can enjoy a little bit of their stories and their information on your targets. And that's good! f/ The cities: are well-designed; gotta say I'm pretty impressed with the way Ubisoft has designed them; From the ledges for you to climb, to the positioning and distributions of Hiding places, I've gotta say no wonder the first AC game was a success! You've gotta play the series from the first game through the last to see how the series has changed over the years!If you have played Prince of Persia before, you will definitely see some common things between the two games, some buildings sure can remind you of some obstacles in POP series CONCLUSION: 9.5/10 when you take into account this is the game made in 10 years ago. Definitely a worthy game to play if you want to have a nice Assassin's Creed collection.			",129,17,2,20,6,0,9

												First I want to start off with no Uplay!The first Assassins Creed game is personally one of my more favorite of the AC titles next to 2, but this game isnt the second and im not going to compare them, im just going to say my honest opinion on this version.To start i really like the whole concept of this taking place in the middle ages, the idea of fighting knights in armour with awesome kill cinematics back in the day for me was sweet! Sprinting over roof tops tossing throwing knives at anyone standing in my way was very entertaining. Personally I really like the whole AC story line even though it confuses the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me at times.On the downside i found the controls when trying to traverse over water areas to be a little touchy and spent a solid half hour drowning, as you progress further into the game the guards are more and more likely to attack you for no reason which albiet is understandable at that point but the running mechanics well they tend to fail you, considering you got like 10 some odd guards chasing you, but even so thats not too bad heyre easy to kill.Lastly the thing i hated the most and always will is those ♥♥♥♥ing beggars! holy♥♥♥♥♥♥i killed soooo many of them i dont care theyre anoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥and constantly block you at the worst times. ♥♥♥♥♥ i know your homeless but I dont want this sword going up my♥♥♥♥♥To surmize this is a really good game and personally if your going to play the series i recommend this one first just for the story if not anything else.9.1/10 would stab beggars again.

												I remember scouring through every possible source I could get my hands on in reference to Assassin's Creed back in 2007. Whenever I came across a morsel of information or a rare screenshot I couldnt help but salivate over the article. The concept was new and invigorating. I said to myself that this would be the game that got me to purchase a console. However this was not to be ( me purchasing a console ) . In fact it wasnt until several years later on steam that I got my chance to play Assassin's Creed for the first time , and I was not dissappointed.Assassin's Creed  is a sandbox style action-adventure-stealth game that centers around the protagonist Desmond Miles. We learn that Desmond is abducted by a pharmaceutical company called Abstergo who forces him into a machine dubbed the ""Animus"". This ""Animus"" allows its user to view the genetic memories of its ancestors , and in Desmonds case the memories of Altair Ibn-La'Ahad. An assassin who lived in the Holy Land during the 3rd crusade.As Altair you will travel through Masyaf , Acre , Jerusalem , and Damascus in search of what Abstergo called ""A Piece of Eden"". While in the Animus Desmond uncovers an age old conflict between the Knights Templar and the Assassins. Through the Animus and Altair , Desmond learns a terrible truth about Abstergo and must find a way to stop them.Assassin's Creed was a novel attempt at a first in what has become a long series of games. It was , and still is a great looking game. Visually you can take in breath taking views of the various cities by scaling the largest buildings , and gazing out in ""Eagle View"". The structures that you climb are mostly accurte representations of actual buildings. Scaling up said structures was a favorite part of the game for me.Combat was fairly simple as you could quite easily dispatch a mob of gaurds easily even in the early game. Most of the side quests were repetitious and of little relevance to the overall progress of the game. However the main assassination quests were intriguing and an integral part in unlocking the secrets of ""Eden"".Overall I think Assassin's Creed was a novel attempt and was a much better game than some of its sequels. If you are the type of gammer that needs stellar graphics and tons of quests then this is probably not the game for you. But if you enjoy exploring and gathering intelligence to unravel a mystery then I would advise you to give Assassin' Creed a play. Overall I think this is a 7/10 game and worth playing to any real fan of the series.			",154,19,0,24,9,0,40

												This game can get a bit repetitive and linear at times, but it still proved to be a lot of fun. I got to kill people, and then upgrade my ability to kill people. The story line was good as it brought about more killing, and the graphics were good, especially the ones where you got to be murder-y. This probably sounds like the rant of a psychopath... But it's still a fun game. I liked Altair more than Ezio, which is probably the minority opinion. For the start of the series this worked pretty gosh darn well, the health mechanics as it related to the storyline was one of the more inspired ideas. Buy it, kill some gaurds and templars, throw some knives and nap in some bureaus.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahhh, assassin's creed! No numbers after that, no other names like Syndicate or Unity! Just it: Assassin's creed. The good old times right?Assassin's creed is not a masterpiece, but is pretty fun and enjoyable.Starting with the flaws:- The gameplay is repetitive; ""Come to a city, hear a conversation, interrogate someone... repeat""; This is his major flaw. If you don't have the patience: DON'T play this game. It can be really frustrating. I was starting to be sick of the same missions on the middle of the game. However, if you have patience, it can be pretty fun. (if not, start in ac2)- Repetitive dialogues and characters (people on the street). I swear that i killed the same guy at least 5 times.- Exiting the game requires movement through 3 or more menu screens;- Limited incentive to explore and collect;- No replay value;Don't let his flaws distract you from the good game that he can be:+ Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous;+ The environments are credible in their attempt to recreate an historical period.+ Voice-acting is excellent; general sound-design too and is strikingly original;+ Good UI;+ Quick-travel available;+ Good ad enjoyable history;+ Combat is good and cinematic;+ Killing a target involves a series of different missions; They are unvaried but adds for immersion.In general, Assassin's creed is a decent game. It's not as good as the sequel, but you should play it.7.5/10			",24,0,0,0,2,0,1

												Relatively easy to beat. Combat is decent. They were really confident in making a sequeal/many sequeals, because there is no ""definite"" ending to this game.Pros: Free-running, amazing kills and an interesting storyline. Cons: Funny AI, some bugs and ""eagle eye"" is the worse vision feature I have ever seen. Historical inaccuracies.The idea of assassinating people is to kill a few, to saves the lives of many. Ironically, there are many cases in which you kill like a GAZILLION soldiers to save ONE poor civilian. I have probably killed about a few hundred guards in a city of a few thousands [Jerusalem] but I guess it's still less than 0.1% so thats' okay. Makes you wonder who is right after all. Still, ""Nothing is true, everything is permitted"", so even the creed can be cast away once awhile.Overall, It's a good game. Would recomend.			",82,7,0,13,9,0,4

After beating the game, you don't really have anything else to do, and you have to replay a memory, but I do understand this as it was the first game of the series and the gaming world has improved insanely in the past few years.

												Great game. Great way to open up a completely new series. The game looks good for its time, free running plays fluidly, and the story is very good. One complaint that most people seem to share, although this wasnt an issue for me, was that the missions became too repetitive. I can see how people found that to be the case but if you stick to doing the bare minimum required to move on, you literally cut the busy work in half and shorten the games lifespan to the perfect length. The combat is very easy and its almost impossible to die from combat once you learn how to counter attack but that doesnt take away from the games experience because you still end up running and sneaking from guards for the sake of saving time. The long horse rides from city to city can be a bit of a pain and the games ending is a TERRIBLE cliffhanger that leaves much to be desired but by the time youre reading this, AC2 is already out anyways so what does it matter? This game is a great buy and its a MUST play.			",73,6,0,6,1,1,1

												Really bad game, combat is boring and repetitive, running and jumping on rooftops is fun for 10 minutes, but its limited by engine and becomes annoying.As a higly trained athlete and assasin you should have advantage over guards, but they are climbing buildings like monkeys, and fight like only computer can.There is no freedom in fights, only few patterns that you have to follow to win.And the most anoying thing is not even in the gameplay, its quiting the game with 10 more clicks and three loading screens just to exit(trying to rage quit means you will get a stroke).I have been told that its all corected in sequels, but that doesnt help this game.

												My first impression- wow, such a masterful piece of work! Graphics, mechanics, idea, story...Then, after an hour or so, the game started to construct a bit of a repetitive pattern, ultimately leading to a small frustration, doing same things over and over again. It made me drop the initial ambition to finish every little side mission and be over with the game as soon as possible, just to see the story, which is, by the way, really fantastic.Nevertheless, as the game progressed to the final chapters, it became increasingly tougher and more intense, and by the end of it, I really started to enjoy it once more. After finishing it, I could say- yes, this game really IS great, despite the repetitiveness. Everything else is just fantastic- the narrative, the graphics, movie-worth fight scenes, cities, the story and the twists, soundtrack, the sense of epicness... I really recommend this game, and the whole series as such! It's one masterfully written and designed piece of art! Kudos, UBI! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed 1 is the starting game for the franchise Assassin's Creed. You play from 2 view points, The modern world where you control Desmond Miles. And in 1191 In the Holy Land where you play as Altair ibn la ahad. The gameplay, and story is very addicting and fun. The fact that you get to murder people where ever you go, and you have side missions, or objectives you get to do throughout the game is awesome. The controls feel very good, and the graphics were good for its time back when it was first released, For any begginers that want to play this game, you may have to sit down for a little and get really comfterable with the controls and becoming aware of your surroundings. Any veterans that have played other Assassin's Creed except this one, you may become frustrated with what they give you in this game, but otherwise you might really enjoy this game. Except for a few thing which is the repetitive gameplay that is in this game. I don't mind it, but after a while you really wished there was more things to do. Oh and the informer challenege can ♥♥♥♥ right off. I would recommend this game to begginers wanting to get into the assassin's creed franchise and want to start from the beggining, but for some veteran assassin creed players, it may seem boring because of its repetitive investigation. 8.5/10 - Fun as ♥♥♥♥ but some boring repetitive gameplay			",31,2,0,4,1,0,0

												This game marked the start of an excellent new intellectual property in a era when originality in the entertainment industry is sorely lacking. These days it seems two out of three movies coming out are either sequels or remakes. I'd avoided spoilers before playing it so I was completely unprepared for the entire Desmond half of the story. The gameplay fulfilled my expectations but the story was so much more than what I had expected. From the trailers I'd seen I thought this would be a game in which I played an assassin taking out some Templar knights organization. But the whole Apple of Eden and the Animus? Didn't see any of that coming.My biggest gripe is that 100% completion (synchronization) doesn't unlock any extras of any kind, and I'm not talking about an Achievement. I had hoped some kind of movie, or maybe some answered would unlock but really you don't get anything at all.My second gripe is that this game is really simple/easy. The gameplay is basically a vehicle for the story. There's really nothing wrong with that, per se, but each ""chapter/target"" of the game plays out identical to the last so it can get repetitive. And as for easyness? There was one time, just one time, in the entire game where I got ""stuck"". It was when i was trying to get the flag on the tallest building in the game, I don't remember which city. As I made the climb I got stuck midway, I couldn't spot a suitable handhold. Just before I started to backtrack I literally thought to myself, ""This game is really easy. There's no way I'd come this far up and have to backtrack for any reason."" I hit the keys to make a jump across a gap onto a wall that didn't look like it had any handholds and, lo!, Altair made the jump and grabbed the wall.			",368,121,4,38,24,4,56

												Recently Bought this game and the next three AC games off the Christmas Steam sale, and I'd say it was sincerely worth it. Now, this game might not seem cool at all if you've played the later Assassin's Creed games such as Black Flag, but if you're just starting, I highly recommend starting here, at ground zero. For me, the combat system was revolutionary, compared to Ubisoft's similar game series ""Prince of Persia,"" it was a major jump. The fact that the city environments in the game are completely open-ended are also an awesome addition. It helps add a realistic element and shows you the effort put into the virtual environment. Now, I personally loved following both story lines, but that may or may not be interesting at all to you. In the event that it isn't, there's plenty of gory combat and backstabbing to cure the itch. So, do I recommend this game, YES. Though it doesn't have a very high replay value, its got great combat and plus, it's the only Assassin's Creed game that saves you having to get Uplay, which can be a little difficult.

												This game's an odd one, in a way, I'm not sure I can describe it.Assassin's Creed felt a bit unfinished game, more like a game mechanic test of some kind, but still, I think it's the one I like the most in the whole series.It wasn't perfect, not even near, but it had that certain challenge, that just made me feel good for surviving. This has definitely the hardest combat, and it's just SO GOOD. When the game was published, it was one-of-a-kind and it kind of still is. Assassin's Creed II changed so much, that it feels like a totally different game. (Don't get me wrong, loved AC2 also)It's sad, how many people, who play the games of this series have skipped the first part, though. They missed a lot.			",134,15,0,20,10,0,8

												My experience playing Assassin's Creed? Well, imagine you're back in school. It's English class and dictation time. You like English and welcome the challenge. So, you master this task and look forward to the next topic. But instead of changing the subject, the teacher forces you to write down the same text he or she has just dictated. Again. And again and again, the very same text, merely replacing a word here and there. Eight times, to be precise. That's Assassin's Creed.As an assassin fallen from grace, you are given the mission to assassinate nine people in order to bring peace to the Holy Land. Each target sits somewhere in one of three large cities. In order to access missions vital for your task, you have to climb to the top of towers, churches and minarettes and get a view of your surroundings from there. If you are bored, you can rescue citizens from being terrorized by city guards. The actual missions to unlock the target are eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing. Once you completed enough of these critical missions, you move in and kill the target. The actual assassination is the only part with a bit of variety. The rest is. Exactly. The. Same. Nine times. This is where AC transcends ist existence as a game and becomes something a game should never, ever be: A chore.If you are REALLY bored, you can spend your time finding hidden flags and assassination target, which reward you with more energy bars. BUT: You can get all bars by climbing the view spots and saving the citizens, all things which are marked on your map. So, unless there's some super-secret unlockable I've never heard of, you have zero reasons to do these sidequests. Oh, sure, you get your XBox 360 achievements for them, so if you're after them, feel free to -Wait.There are good and worthwhile things in Assassin's Creed. The atmosphere is nice, if a bit cold. The cities are well-realized. The animation of your player character is nothing short of spectacular, even now. The freerunning is great fun... and honestly the only thing that made see this one through. Now, I haven't played the second part yet, but from what I've heard, it's supposed to be far superior. And, granted, the game tried something new, and you can't expect it to get it right the first time. But this... this feels less than a fully-developed game than a proof-of-concept. And by its very definition, a proof-of-concept is not supposed to get released.			",443,110,7,59,33,3,71

												Third person view assassination parkour simulator.The ""simulator"" is especially befitting as this is in fact a story of one kidnapped Desmond Miles, set in what appears to be a not so distant future. Machine called Animus s(t)imulates genetic memories of our hero to put him in shoes of his ancestor, assassin Altaïr ibn-La'Ahad, during times of the Third Crusade.This meta story is definitely one of the highlights of this adventure game. The other being the pretty well executed, smooth freerunning exploration aspect. I also love how the whole Animus business explains lots of acceptable breaks from reality present in video games. But then who will explain the stuff that is going on for Desmond? xDI would hesitate though to call this much of ""action"" game or especially ""stealth"" game. It's rather easy, for one, bar maybe the very end and any area that has water as Altaïr can survive falls from some rather jarring heights but can't swim even in a puddle of liquid. But okay, let it be an action adventure.For two, however, regarding the stealth aspect. You're not that much interesting to the guards to begin with and then you simply have one button to make you even less interesting, kind of hiding in plain sight (blending). Once you do garner unhealthy interest what you do is run away, break line of sight and hide in some hay or something, often jumping there from some ridiculous heights.Except you often get this impression it is actually easier and faster to kill dozen of guards rather than to run from them and hide.In short, the stealth aspect is actually barely present and not that all rewarding, especially compared to something I would call ""proper"" stealth like in Dishonored or even Deus Ex: HR or Batman. Not mentioning Thief, of course, that's a given. But I imagine I have to set this expectation for the whole series that this is more about the story, freerunning and mass murder rather than stealth. Not saying it's bad, just bit different from what I originally anticipated.Arguably the most challenging part is gathering literally hundreds of some flags loitered around, yet it gives you pretty much nothing, there aren't even uplay points or steam achievements for that (on consoles you'd get achievos at least). Sufficient to say I gave up on that portion :] Even creator pretty much agreed he was just trolling players with that. Although I did execute all the ""side"" missions even if you're required to do only a fraction of them to proceed.Ah.. the missions.. That's another stab at gameplay. Despite all the open ended nature, it gets pretty repetetive. Maybe that's why they decided not to force all side missions on you.Overall I'd still say it is a pretty interesting experience, and even if it didn't exactly meet my expectations it did nicely set off the whole franchise and can't wait to play the next installments.

												One of the classics from the early 360/PS3 era. You play as Desmond, a test subject for a mysterious project which involves the use of a machine called ""The Animus"". The Animus transports the subject into the body of any ancestor from the subject's bloodline, via genetic memory. Altair is the ancestor of choice in this game. There's so much running and jumping it'll make you want to take up parkour. The animation is beautiful as well as the worlds. The worlds are so impressive, visiting places like Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, each having it's own distinct feel and design. Certainly a work of art. Buy it, play it, love it.

												When I first played this game, I was very disappointed. First of all, I wasn't playing Ezio, which really bugged me because I knew nothing about the other assassins; second, I was VERY confused by the way they incorporated the Animus into the game, and had you switch between history and modern times. And finally, it can be pretty damn frustrating to have to walk across an entire city to simply avoid alerting guards; those cities are huge, man! But after I was about half-way through, I began to appreciate it. Altair is, in fact, a really bad♥♥♥♥♥assassin, and the switch between modernity and history actually makes more sense in this game than it does in the others. Though you need to be a paitent player to enjoy this game, I think it was worth every hour I put into it.			",167,9,0,9,8,2,26

The game gets progressively harder in a manageable way, until the end.4. The missions are challenging and interesting, especially early on.5. The sword fighting is pretty realistic.Cons1. The game gets tedious after the fourth or fifth major mission. Each new city seems to have the exact same tasks with a big assassination at the end.2. Some side missions seems pointless (especially collecting all the flags).			",116,6,4,9,9,0,2

The main missions feel repetitive after a while and the sword fighting is archaic.  However, the actions associated with the hidden blade are thrilling.  The story keeps you interested all the way to the end and will make you a life-long franchise devotee after the credits.  A must buy for any gamer who enjoys historical detail.			",173,4,2,5,3,0,7

												One of my favourites, if not personal favourite in the series.The setting is perfect, controls can be clunky at times but theres a combination of fluidity and harshness that makes combat feel GOOD in this game. Traversing the world is enjoyable, and the story is enjoyable.Missions are rather repetitive, but never enough to detract entirely from the game. That being said, for any newcomer I'd highly recommend reading a synopsis and jumping into Assassin's Creed 2. The gameplay is arguably much superior, and the missions are much less repetitive. That being said, it is a great game unto itself, if a bit aged.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm completely new to the Assassin's Creed franchise.  Quite how I've managed to steer clear of it for quite so long, I don't really know and now that I have finally played it, it would seem it's been a happy accident.  I've obviously been aware of each release and the hype and disappointment that has surrounded each one but never took the initiative and bought one.  Now with the Steam sales and being ten years late to the party, I thought I'd pick it up where it all began for less than £2 and see what all the fuss is about.The atmosphere and free running mechanics are great and show great attention to detail which I love but that's about as far as the positivity goes.  The storyline has so much potential but is ultimately crap and the ending is just shocking.  And the journey you go through to get there is just so damn repetetive!  Finally, it plays more of a brawler than actual stealthy assassin work.  Overall a big disappointment and with much the same criticisms hanging around the franchise as a whole, I think this will be my first and last foray into the world of Assassins Creed.

												First I want to start off with no Uplay!The first Assassins Creed game is personally one of my more favorite of the AC titles next to 2, but this game isnt the second and im not going to compare them, im just going to say my honest opinion on this version.To start i really like the whole concept of this taking place in the middle ages, the idea of fighting knights in armour with awesome kill cinematics back in the day for me was sweet! Sprinting over roof tops tossing throwing knives at anyone standing in my way was very entertaining. Personally I really like the whole AC story line even though it confuses the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me at times.On the downside i found the controls when trying to traverse over water areas to be a little touchy and spent a solid half hour drowning, as you progress further into the game the guards are more and more likely to attack you for no reason which albiet is understandable at that point but the running mechanics well they tend to fail you, considering you got like 10 some odd guards chasing you, but even so thats not too bad heyre easy to kill.Lastly the thing i hated the most and always will is those ♥♥♥♥ing beggars! holy♥♥♥♥♥♥i killed soooo many of them i dont care theyre anoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥and constantly block you at the worst times. ♥♥♥♥♥ i know your homeless but I dont want this sword going up my♥♥♥♥♥To surmize this is a really good game and personally if your going to play the series i recommend this one first just for the story if not anything else.9.1/10 would stab beggars again.

												In the first Assassin's Creed game you're the boring dude (Desmond) who's been kidnapped and is forced to lie the hell down and run around in a virtual reality as his assassin ancestor Altair, because the modern day moe'suckra Templars want information from your tiny baby brain memory.This game is as good as the second game but in it's own way. I feel a bit more like an assassin in this one (though he still looks a bit out of place), the combat is more of a challenge and assassinating people is generally harder. There isn't as much side stuff to do just the flag collecting thing, and those other 3 optional missions you can do when you're finding information for each assassination memory.You can't change your clothes and armour and you are given weapons when the game says so. You also have alot less weapons than Ezio and you don't get as much help. Overall it's just more challenging but it feels like a bigger achievement when you kill them dudes good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I decided to come back to this game after few years, and i must say it stil looks awesome from graphic point of view and especially if you look at the story whitch is very immersive. It also have its bugs and gliches, repetitivnes of quests is kinda annoying but the main storyline is quite good if you disregard constant misions ""save the citzen"" or some other thet you do over and over again. But you must not forget that this is the first game in the AC franchise and so it is a bit unpolished and its sequels ar better in one more aspects, but again not all agree on this question.

												I think the game has a lot to offer. Psuedo-open world, side quests and objectives, nice graphics for its time and decent mechanics. However, it just could not hold my interest. Most of my time played on this game was it running in the background while I alt-tabbed to do other things. I got it because I was given the latest version (Black Flag) as a bundle for something else I bought and thought I should play through the series as to understand the entirety of the story.Alas, I'll probably never get around to finishing this game or ever playing its successors.I do think a lot of people will get enjoyment out of the game, even if I didn't and as such would recommend it.

												Amazing, considering the date it was released. However, it would have been better if the storyline was more creative, or actions were more exciting and not repeating over and over. As you are playing, you will find yourself trying to finish the mission as soon as possible because you are getting tired of it.Instructions of controls do not make sense, - you will get used to it soon though- you can not put subtitles on or skip cinematics.However, generally, it is a good game.

												Assassin's Creed can be vaguely compared to the concept of 'The Matrix' in which you play a protagonist in the 'real world' who becomes someone else inside a 'virtual world'. It tells a fictional story of a war between Assassins and Templars - and spans across several real life historic periods. The franchise is one of few - which tells a massive story back-to-back instead of switching main characters half way through or making massive time jumps. Awesome franchise!			",376,87,11,48,43,0,73

												Assassin's Creed is a decent game. The game brings a good story and interesting mechanics/concepts along with it. The game has a good story that in itself is reason enough to play. The game falls short in its variation and some elements of the gameplay. The story is interesting and builds up to a semi-expected conclusion. This does not ruin the game though because there is still plenty left unexplained as to the future of where the series will take you and what your actions really mean for the world going forward. The story kept me engaged and interested throughout. The actual gameplay is where this game does not shine. Yes, there are some interesting and fun mechanics. The combat system works well, although counters = godmode. [The game becomes too easy. You can easily fight a mob of 20+ guards and never lose any health].  The game falls flat in terms of its variation. The bulk of the game is made up of the same combination of elements. 1. Go to this city. 2. Gather information. 3. Assassinate. Granted the system works it gets boring quickly. There are no real side missions to speak of and the flag collection system gives you nothing and is not worth the effort. Overall, I still recommend playing the game because of the story. It is worth trduging through the repetitive gameplay to build on the lore of a series that gets better and better as it progresses.

												The original. Great story, the element of past vs. present and the ever-present mystery and suspense is almost overhelming. A definite favourite of mine at any rate. This game got me into the Assassin's creed franchise. The gameplay may not be the very best there is, but it's good. The ""side missions"" are the same in every city and every district, which is at times boring. However, the whole story and the actual main missions are all worth this. The free-running aspect of the gameplay is of course the main pull. Even at this stage it's already great fun to run along the rooftops, though it gets considerably better in the later games. The weapons are few, but it's enough for this game. The hidden blade and the sword are all you need most of the time, anyway.My favourite part are the little ""stories"" told during the death scenes. The dialogue is well written and it makes you think and question and doutb much like it does the main character. The plot is the driving force of this games at any rate, because the mystery and the power are something to be revealed, something to be discovered.The combat is fairly easy, once you get the hang of it. As you acquire new skills and techniques, you grow bolder in combat, no longer waiting for the opportunity to counter, but to attack as well. The aspect of growth is important as the game progresses and as the character changes. First, you get to try out all the things you have, all that you can do, but you do not know how to do or use most of those things. Then, they are ripped away from you and you're left with only the bare necessities. You learn as the characters does, to use the little you have and to deserve more.The cities are different in architecture, all magnificent, although the details are not all that sharp. However, this is the first game and if played first, it will pull you in. It's set where most other games never set foot, therefore compelling.The educational side is great. The characters presented in the games, mostly ""villains"", are based, in many cases, on real history-related people. There's so much to learn and so much passion to ignite while having fun at the same time.One major downside is the lack of subtitles. For someone such as myself, who is not a native speaker, it is hard to understand the dialogue at times, which is a pity since it's so well written. Also, the hearing impaired gamers are sure to feel left out, because they cannot enjoy this piece as well as they could were the subtitles there.Despite the fact that the gameplay is somewhat repetitive, apart from the main missions, it is still revolutionary. You're allowed to run and be free for as long as you wish. The combat is fun, because winning usually is - saving poor people is a bonus and you feel like a hero for a while, though the story and the other characters don't see you as such. But as the story grows, so does the character and this is one of the few games where the main character learns, grows and changes. The Altair you start out with and the one you are at the end are not the same and the difference is palpable. The game holds a potential for greatness only developed and fully discovered in the later games. It makes for an enjoyable 20-hour ride nonetheless.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think it's a 3/10 controls are really hard and the fights to and the game is very confusing.Edit: I played the full game and it was ok. 7/10 it was hard controls but that may be because i played Blackflag before this one. Some setups were a bit weird. If you failed it and got caught by guards then you kill them or run away (i killed them) And then there were dead bodies in front of the guy i was suppose to kill so he got alerted and i couldn't do it. So i went and did another setup instead			",64,6,0,2,9,0,3

												The first in the series is also one of the roughest in the series, due to the amount of backtracking and lack of adequate fast travel. That said, Altair is one of the more interesting and mysterious characters in the series and it's worth seeing his roots if you really enjoy the overall story.The 'present day' story with Desmond is also essential to the following games, and the cryptic clues presented in the first title are some of the best in the series, IMO.If you want a solid foundation for the series or are just looking to pad out your collection to have all the games, the original Assassin's Creed is still worth picking up.

												I want to like this game I really do, but its just such a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job of converting it to pc its unforgivable. Firstly it takes 4 menus 2 load screen and a conformation box to exit the game, which in all take about 40 secconds.The HUD is crap, its an xbox dpad, useless for a 1234 keyboard layout.the controls fair no better, it is a littral mapping of pad A = LMB, etceach button does about 3 things depending if your holding control or shift, I have 152 keys let me use them!Aside from that, the game is pretty slow paced, building up to the assisintations, which isn't as bad as it seems, despite the game trying it's best to make movement not feel slow, becomes a chore.It does have some spark to it, the climing animations is fanstasticly well done, and fighting is enjoyable, but you have very little connection with  the enviroment around you, nothing ever changes or progresses, making playing it seem pointless.

												The game that started a very popular and succesful series. What I liked the most was the never seen before freedom of vertical movement. Climbing was probably the most satisfying element of this game. Story was very intriguing, although missions are very repetitive throughout the game. Game is split into several memories. You do a few side quests gathering information about local person of interest and then you proceed to asssassinate him. You repeat this formula until the very end boss battle. What broke the monotomy is returning to reality, to present, and learning more about the templars and Assassins in our time. Ending was very mysterious and opened infinite posibilities for future Assassin's Creed games which Ubisoft, as we all know, used very agressively. Not a year passes and we see another AC game. But about those later.All in all, this game was something unique for its time and was a very solid game. It features increadibly lifelike cities and it is one of the best parkour games with very unique setting. Worst thing about it though, was trying to exit the game, which required something like 5 loading screens. But that was finally fixed. Main story gave me about 20-24 hours of gameplay, but there's tons of side things to do and explore which can prolong the game to over 30 hours.Gameplay 7/10Story 8/10Sound 8/10Graphics 7/10Polish 8/10-------------Overall 7.5/10 (very good game)			",215,22,9,21,16,2,25

												This game was released on November 13, 2007. I am fairly new to the Assassin's Creed series and just recently began playing the second game on PS3. I highly recommend this game to anyone who plays any of the Assassin's Creed games. I wanted to play this one first because the storyline does connect to the other games and I didn't want to miss out. This game includes basic gameplay. No achievements, upgrades, money system, etc. Basic weapons and missions. The maps are very diverse and if you like challenges, you will enjoy flag hunting. There are a lot of flags to find throughout the game and several missions to complete. The PC version of Assassin's Creed is the only one to have the Director's Cut Edition which includes 4 bonus missions. The following mission types are as follows: Archer Assassination, Rooftop Race Challenge, Merchant Stand Destruction Challenge, and Escort Challenge. You will be able to play these in each kingdom you travel through. Though these bonus missions are very basic compared to the latest Assassin's Creed games, they were unavailable on the console versions for the first game.Also, Jesper Kyd composed the music for the game. He is known for several video game scores including the Hitman series, a few Assassin's Creed games, and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, to name a few. I give the game 5 out of 5 stars. It was excellent and the storyline is awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So I bought It.Gameplay could be a bit better but it's not really a problem.Parkour could be better. Altair was an easy character to get use to and enjoy, but saddly you can't swim.There is nice spaceing in the game. So you can run around, climb, and hide. Story was great!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything good and fun about this game is also everything that's frustrating.The story is good. The combat is mostly fun. Free running is mostly fun. The ""jump and tackle/stab someone"" move is awesome. But almost all of those have very frustrating moments that get all the more frustrating the more they happen.Lockon is absolute crap. There was moments where I was trying to quickly assassinate someone with a throwing knife and ended up either missing or getting spotted before I could strike. To make matters worse, even if I was spotted but still close enough for a throwing knife kill, the game locks on the closest enemy to me. To enter combat, one must press R to enter combat mode (read: lock on to enemies). This is EXTREMELY frustrating when you're trying to quickly dispatch one or two enemies in your way before moving on (when you're in group of five or more). There are also times you'll think you're fighting only to realize the game didn't automatically enter combat mode for you. It's extremely inconsistent.When on ledges near enemies, there doesn't seem to be away to assassinate your enemy without first awkwardly jumping down and hoping he doesn't hear you (unless you have throwing knives). I once had someone RIGHT in front of me but botched the stealth assassination because I was out of knives and couldn't do the ""jump wrist stab"" move.The assassination get repetitive after awhile. You do the same thing over and over. Get 3 sources of info, report back, assassinate. Get 3 sources of info, report back, assassinate. Et Cetera. The concept is cool, but gets less interesting each time. When given advice on where to investigate, the game doesn't seem to keep a log of the info the local bureau has given you. That never get's annoying. Plus, it seems (from what I've seen) you must re-synchronize every time your told to investiage the ""southeast"" or ""north"" or whatever. That or they expect you to immediately recognize or remember what a Middle-Eastern hostpital looks like. Free running is super fun when it works. It's super frustrating when it doesn't. Altair might jump in the wrong direction, jump too far, not jump far enough, jump into a wall instead of an enemy, jump off a building, etc. This will ruin a lot of missions for you, or make them take longer.Also annoying is when drunk and crazy people in the streets push you into others and you're chased by the guards because of it. So yeah, as much as I hate certain parts of the game, I still recommend it. Just know what you're getting into. And here's hoping each future game gets better and better.Also, the game seems to run like crap on DX10 (when there are more then 10 people in a crowd, the FPS drop like bombs). I had to open the Local Game Files (or whatever Steam calls it) to launch the DX9 version which runs a million times better (also why Steam only shows me having played the game for about 1 1/2 hours). And it's not because my PC can't handle the max graphics or anything. It's in the software. I can run BF4 on High-Ultra settings with my current setup.			",63,3,0,11,1,0,3

Like pickpockets that can't happen, and the assassination of William, at the end of which something crashes: either the game, the video driver, or both. I'm really upset now at having to play the same scenario over and over again. I'll probably just give it up and remove the game from my library. You might not have these issues, but if you start noticing weird things, or get game crashes, you soon will tire of this, as I have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An awful, buggy, seemingly untested port of the XBOX360 original.* The controls are awful, and this is with a controller.* The physics are somehow off, and Altair will randomly fail to grab obvious ledges, move in strange directions, and sometimes die landing on a pile of hay when performing his leap of faith.* Crashes to desktop are fairly frequent, which is excruciating with the save checkpoint system.* Other bugs will often preclude you from continuing assassinations, forcing you to manually restart from checkpoint.A tedious, buggy mess.  I deeply regret making this purchase.  Get it for the XBOX360 instead if you can.			",238,24,0,56,35,1,60

It is not our right to punish one for thinking what they do, no matter how much we disagree.Jubair: Then what?Altair: You of all people should know. Educate them, teach them right from wrong - it must be knowledge that frees them, not force.Jubair: They do not learn, fixed in their ways as they are. It is an illness, for which there is but one cure.Altair: You are wrong, and that is why you must be put to rest.Jubair: Am I not unlike those precious books you seek to save; a source of knowledge with which you disagree? Yet you are rather quick to steal my life.Altair: A small sacrifice to save many. It is necessary.The sheer maturity in which this game has been built upon is just staggering!

												I finally decided to sit down, buy Assassin's Creed and actually play and beat the game. And I can say, I really enjoyed it! I have never been a fan of the series but never actually played any of them through the whole story. After completing the game I can definatly say I will be getting the next one! The game is a little repetitive, but I still enjoyed doing the same things over and over again. The parkour elements are pretty awesome but haven't been ported to PC very well (not sure what its like on console). The cutscenes and also some of the fighting are a bit glitchy too, which can be anoying but other than that its really good! Not to difficult to play on a keyboard and mouse if thats a worry and can see some replay value in the game. Overall I would give it a 7 or 8/10.			",88,6,2,8,13,0,2

But for an 2008 game it is fantastic and still holds as one of the better games out even in 2014. The graphics are amazing, the combat is fun and skillful, but the kill then run then hide gets very repetive and tiring. The reason this didn't get 10/10 is because of the repetiveness and because how quickly Altair changed. He became a badass, listen to no one guy to an Enlightened, I understand why my actions are wrong kind of guy in almost a blink of an eye.			",75,2,3,14,9,0,8

												Boring, repetetive and clunky.Though the first hour of the game is promising, it all goes downhill as it progresses. The whole game is repetition of the same kind of missions, and with it's clunky gameplay and unusual AI, it quickly gets boring. The story is interesting but the long and arduous grind you have to go through is not worth it. The game started feeling like a chore and led me to losing all interest. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worst game in the seriesThe controlls are godawful, the guards have insane difficulty spikes; one minute they're laughably easy and the next they're unkillable. Altair's voice acting sounds like some unpaid intern just woke up from a deep sleep, and Altair has the personality of a rocking chair with a frownie face drawn on it. The present day story is Much, much more boring compared to the other games. The only reason I bring these up is that people said this was better than the games that came after this. Who could make that conclusion? The guards attack on sight if they see you climbing buildings, gameplay is VERY MONOTONOUS AND BORING. No currency. Beggars are all up in your personal bubble asking for money, and the only way to shut them up is to punch them in the face which upsets guards. Toward the end of the game, it takes a MASSIVE difficulty dive. The investigations are almost uncompletable, since they rely mostly on not being detected. I suppose the best part of the game was that the beginning was kind of good. The story in this one's present day may have sucked, but it started up a great franchise. Off to a bad start, but the rest of the games are really good. Once you swallow the bitter pill that is this game, the payoff, which is the rest of the series, is da bomb diggity, yo.Even with that last part, I just can't recommend this, because you could probably read a synopsis and get what you need to start with AC2.

												Assassins creed has many awesome mechanics and a very interesting story.However, the mechanics mostly fail and the story is extremely predictable.The combat goes from extremely difficult to super easy after the first mission. The freerunning often causes you to jump off random ledges killing yourself, the set up missions are extremely boring and repetative, and the world - being set up in the middle east - looks like a poorly textured sand dune. Here is why I recommend this game: The story, while predictable, is great. Its extremely interesting and it sets up the world fantastically, the side characters are well developed and have strong motivations, and while the set up missions are boring and repetative, the main missions are interesting and pretty solid. Im really hoping that as the series develops the mechanics tighten up and the story continues in a similar fashion, but with less predictablity. The only thing that I would change is I would add a stealth mechanic. The missions could be far more interesting with one.If you are interested in playing I would recommend just doing the minimum amount of set up missions per area and rushing through the game and enjoying the story. Im only a few hours in Assassins Creed 2, but most of my complaints are answered by it so far. I give it a 4/10. Blamo.			",205,81,3,25,16,2,25

												Odds are that you've either already played Assassin's Creed already, or never will so this review seems a bit like an exercise in futility so I'll keep it short.Assassin's Creed pretty much single-handedly created the open world parkour platformer game that everyone ended up making eventually. The game itself is still decent despite some design issues, such as doing the same repetitive side quests in order to progress the convoluted main story, or being able to beat the game by using a single combat move ad nauseam. Still, Assassin's Creed (both the first game and the series) does a great job of taking you through various historic locations and keeping you engaged as it does. It's a definite recommendation from me.			",285,124,4,44,27,4,28

												This is the first game in the long Assassin's Creed franchise and honestly this is one of the only ones which is true to it's name. While the game is repetitive and boring at times, it is purely about assassinations. It is therefore unique in that sense as the mechanics that are there work great. If you are new to the Assassin's Creed franchise then this is a good place to start, however you may not finish it and even if you do, you may not return to the game. Worth purchasing when on sale.

												Game's pretty good; however, it is extremely repetitive in a lot of ways. The story is repetitive; the investigations are repetitive; the objectives within the investigations are repetitive, and the combat is extremely repetitive. If you don't like doing the same thing over and over, this game will make you want to shoot yourself. If I were to give it a score on a 10 point scale, I'd give it a 6.5. The visuals were actually pretty good, and its setting was fascinating. I found the backstory (there are two stories - one in which you are in an Animus, reliving your ancestor's assassin memories, and the other where you are a random dude being tested on in this lab by a sketchy scientist) more interesting than the ""main"" one. Is the game extremely over-hyped? Yes. Was it worth the $5.00 I paid for it? Yeah, I'd say so. Overall, decent game. Don't buy it if it's more than $10.00.			",123,35,1,21,6,0,8

												Refreshing Game as i am new to the AC series. I wanted to play the entire series from start to finish and what a way to start. It is almost a complete game for me, I am familiar with other reviews this game has received and some negativity. But you hardly notice any fault as you play this game. Its a lot of fun, and it is what i look for in games such as this. A lot of climbing and jumping, the fighting mechanics is awesome compared to other games. I can go on for hours with the good.A few bad points;1. Running into people, may loose control of player.2. Cut away scenes get annoying after a while.3. Player jumps onto walls repeatedly gets annoying as it makes no progress climbing.Get this game if you like to have fun. Something they forgot about in AC Unity			",21,1,2,1,2,1,0

												The first of an awesome series where you get to follow in the footsteps of  Desmond Miles's Ancestors who happened to be Assassin's fighting for freedom. In this game you get to follow Altair, who lived during the Crusades of the late 12th century. The game can be repetitive, but I personally think the satisfying combat mechanics makes up for it and it becomes even better as the series progress further. It's most certainly worth a try.

												Years ago when Assassin's Creed first came out, I wasn't impressed. I played a few hours of it, only to walk away annoyed and disappointed. Recently however, when the majority of the Assassin's Creed franchise was on sale for less than $5 a game, I decided to give it another try. That was one of the best decisions I've made in gaming and I've been hooked ever since.The true historical applications of the game, albeit slighty modified, is intriguing, educational, and very well-done. I felt as though I really was fighting an oppressive force during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in 1191. This game takes advantage of historical events, locations, and terminology in the same way the Metal Gear series does. The ancestoral concept throughout the game was like nothing I've ever seen in a game and brought a uniqueness to it. The protagonist, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, is a competent fighter and agile acrobat. The growth of character witnessed during the course of the game was satisfying and gave you a clearer understanding of what the creed means.On the other hand, the tasks were a little repetitive and stealth wasn't very prevalant. You had very few ways to sneak up on someone and would rather kill someone then have to run away each time. Regardless, the game was immensely satisfying and paved way for numerous sequels that I loved as well.This is a must buy.			",59,6,0,18,0,0,2

This being the first game to this awesome series I am just completly blown away. The story line is somewhat difficult to follow, but the story itself is really cool, not to mention part of this game is based off of true events and characters. The game can be slow in some parts but when you get into those really intense moments its fast pased and the next thing you know, your standing and playing at the same time. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking to get into a storyline based game but also who is looking for the adrenalin. I will definently be playing more of this in the future.

												The game features a huge, gorgeous world that feels wholly alive, has fluid controls (most of the times) make it fun to run across city rooftops, joyous mix of stealth (but sometimes AI is plain dumb), action, and platforming, stunning sound design features fantastic voice acting and a beautiful musical score. Tons of small details will constantly amaze you even with its occasional glitches.			",87,36,9,9,0,2,10

												Although there's still room for improvement because the mission design can be very very repetetive, Assassin's Creed introduces stunning gameplay and a thrilling story never seen before in the gaming industry. If the developers take care of that, the sequel could be one of the best games ever made! 7.8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this on my 360, just to refresh my memory i played it again.  Only this time i did not care for the flags in it or the templars.  Graphically the game looks amazing. At the time the game was revolutionary.  Story wise was also compelling.  The one down fall of the game was the gameplay.  It's very repititve.  You do the same type of investigating etc etc over and over and over. It might be for a different person you are going to kill but its the same.. Once you need to assassinate your target ALMOST nothing you do different will cause you to fail unlike 2.  Which is basically sandbox style which basically i kind of like because you can go in guns blazing or try and do it stealth. Now i only played 1 again to get the story of it. Definitely was worth what i paid which was about 5 or less.			",223,4,11,11,20,1,30

												Assassin's Creed 1 is the starting game for the franchise Assassin's Creed. You play from 2 view points, The modern world where you control Desmond Miles. And in 1191 In the Holy Land where you play as Altair ibn la ahad. The gameplay, and story is very addicting and fun. The fact that you get to murder people where ever you go, and you have side missions, or objectives you get to do throughout the game is awesome. The controls feel very good, and the graphics were good for its time back when it was first released, For any begginers that want to play this game, you may have to sit down for a little and get really comfterable with the controls and becoming aware of your surroundings. Any veterans that have played other Assassin's Creed except this one, you may become frustrated with what they give you in this game, but otherwise you might really enjoy this game. Except for a few thing which is the repetitive gameplay that is in this game. I don't mind it, but after a while you really wished there was more things to do. Oh and the informer challenege can ♥♥♥♥ right off. I would recommend this game to begginers wanting to get into the assassin's creed franchise and want to start from the beggining, but for some veteran assassin creed players, it may seem boring because of its repetitive investigation. 8.5/10 - Fun as ♥♥♥♥ but some boring repetitive gameplay			",31,2,0,4,1,0,0

												As of this review I've been playing almost 11 hours and have yet to finish the game.Being a history buff it is interesting to go and explore the Middle East, especially during the the Third Crusade in the 12 century. I'm one who enjoys exploring the world and the game rewards that in a way.I've enjoyed the game so far but with a few minor complaints.The Good:+ The gameplay is good and fairly solid.+ The setting is interesting to me.+ The story is interesting, if not a bit contrived.The Bad:- The game can and does become repetitive. Especially late game. - The world is too small. Well, for an explorer like me anyway.All in all it's a good game and I would recommend it.			",88,25,0,25,8,0,18

												The first AC game. I played this one when it was out.Awesome game, brought some fresh air in the game industry.The graphics were awesome at that time, the mechanics were something singular.If you have played any other AC game, you will probably not like this one... It's always like that. Unless you play with the mind that this was the first one.The plot is cool, as works nice with all the other AC games with Desmond.If you are a fan of the AC series, buy it and have fun.(still better than AC III)			",372,127,5,28,18,1,19

												I played this a long time ago on the 360 but could never really finish it due to varying reasons. But seeing as all the Assassin Creed games are on sale I went ahead and got all of them for a pretty decent price of $5 a piece, which isn’t bad for such a big series. Replaying through the game the story isn’t half bad, and am looking forward to reviewing the other Assassins Creed games in time.One big negative thing is the way climbing works.  It isn’t horrible, but there are times where you would want to climb up a building fast rather than jump off a building killing yourself in the process.  Other than that, this was a big hit in the series and is a great story, providing you are more of a story driven person. 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this game, you play as a Syrian man named Altair Ibn-La-Ahad, and he is part of an order of Assassins (hence the name Assassin's Creed). You start the game in real time, as a man named Desmond who has been taken by a company known as Abstergo Industries, a company where they are secretly part of the order of the Knight's Templars. The Templars are enemies to Assassins, and since Desmond is an ancestor of the previously meantioned assassin Altair, the head executive and his assistant Lucy put Desmond into a machine called the Animus. The Animus lets a person delve into his ancestor's memories, and since Altair is an ancestor to Desmond, the executive (i forgot his name, but lets just call him Bill) puts you into the Animus so he can monitor Altair's memories and find a secret that the Templars need that only Altair know. Once you are in the Animus, you finally play as Altair. You start in a mine looking for a Templar named Roberto, and once you find him, you see he is planning to steal the holy artifact known as the Ark of Covenant. You fail to kill him, and your other Assassins are left to kill him (one of them fails by the way). You go back to your master, Al Mualim, and he finds out about the attack. Suddenly Roberto and his fellow Templars are attacking, and you send a diversion to help. After you send the diversion, they flee, and Al Mualim punishes you because you did not remember the three strict rules to being an Assassin in the earlier mission. He stabs you, and you pass out. You are still alive and you must kill 9 other Templars to redeem yourself and be one of the master Assassins again.The game is overall very good, but there are a few things I did not like. First of all, I know it is set in the First Crusades Period (somewhere around 1000 A.D it started) but Altair cannot hold any type of currency. Your gearand weapons are gained from each of the 9 Templars you kill. Also, in the trailer, Altair is seen to have a crossbow as one of his weapons, but that crossbow is nowhere in the actual game, so that got me dissapointed. Another thing is that youdont carry any types of medicine or potions or things like that, which would be useful in fighting because Altair isnt the best fighter without ALL of his weapons. Speaking of health, you dont have an actual health meter. Your health is displayed in something called a Synchronization Bar, a bar that fills as you do good in the game. If you commit crimes, your Synchronization Bar goes down. If you lose fights, it also goes down. Basically, anything bad makes it go down. Those are basically all the problems i have with this game.To wrap it up, Assassin's Creed is a fun game with a really cool and exciting storyline, not alot of  situations i was mad or angry about, but it is old. The graphics are from somewhere around 2000 (i dont know when the games came out by years). So if you dont mind about graphics and want to have a fun action-adventure game with enticing storyline, Assassin's Creed is the game for you.My Rating: 9/10Note from Author: There is stealth in this game. You will have to blend in with crowds, pickpocket without being caught, and if you are caught by a guard or someone you are pickpocketing, you can go blend in by sitting in a bench, hiding in a haystack, blending in with a group of scholars (they look similar to you in clothing), or just running away until they give up. There is a fourth way to blend in, but I forgot it. Another thing in this game is climbing and parkour. You will have to do alot of that, so be prepared.			",29,2,0,1,2,0,1

												Slightly hampered by a fussy camera and some rough edges around the graphics, this is still a great game. Towns and cities feel alive, the combat and free-running is relatively fluid and mostly good fun, and Altair makes a decent character to play as.It's still worth playing as the story is well-developed and keeps you going, and the gameplay is rewarding when it all works. The second game may still be the best, but this is by no means a poor second place.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
