												As expected of Daedalic Entertainment -- another fantastic game among their legendary line of epic point and click adventure games.The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a game I highly recommend. The art is so beautiful and vivid that it is as if I am playing a point and click game on a canvas that develops fantastically as the story progresses that it belongs in a museum.Not only is the art which masterfully changes from cheerful to dark with impeccable precision a reason to pick up this game but also the soundtrack (violins, angelic chorus, harps, guitars and a variety of other musical instruments) and voice acting are spot on with precision accuracy only seen in the military (May only apply to one branch). Most importantly, the puzzles (as expected of a Daedalic game) range from ""just right"" to ""just stupid hard"" with a rewarding sense of feeling unreplicable by other games (that is of course, it is a Daedalic game).The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav has some rpg elements in the form of dialogues but the consequences of your decisions are immediate and are in no way long term. But, being that it is, it definitely renders a second and even a third play through.I would like to extend this review to several pages length but I want to get back to playing the game. :)			",334,91,5,42,25,3,52

												I have alot of experience with point and click games, but I always end up searching for help in a walkthrough whenever I get stuck. This time I wanted to do it all alone and with no help at all. I did also remove any options for hints/highlighter, and played it in hard mode. Very wise choice!The game got an interesting, good history and the way I played it, it got even more interesting, but also more frustrating too. As I went through the game, trying to play it as logical as possible, I often ended up in dead ends. I decided to quit the game and think about it a while and continue later. To not spoil anyone, I can tell you that being accurate and using your eys and head helps alot.When I played it like I did I was often really close to wanting to search help to get further in the game, even when I knew what to do, but not how to do it. It made me be on the brink of giving up, but not quite. When getting past those ""harder"" parts it felt good. I think this is how game should be played!I am not quite done with the game yet. It has some achievements, I have been thinking about while I was playing the game. For my own good, I saved every time I got to a new place with no option to return to it, and hopefully that will make the achievements taking less time than necessary to do, but still have fun with.

												So there i was, booting up The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav (TDE:COS hereafter) for the the first time. The game started straight away, a blessing after experiencing major compatibility issues with Daedelic's The Whispered World, and soon I was in game, launching into a somewhat abrupt beginning. Suddenly, the game stopped, seemingly frozen, before launching into dialogue, followed by the same thing EVERY TIME I spoke to someone. Now, I don't have an amazing computer, but I can handle fully 3D games just fine, no hangs. So I went to the options menu, turned everything down to low and it WAS WORSE! After some forum hunting I finally found out that TDE:COS needs to run in native color depth. So, I went to the configuration tool, changed it to 32-bit (from the lowest option, 16-bit) and, lo and behold, a fun game began to emerge.I will say, that this was the most frustrating experience that I had with this game. The puzzles were fairly logical throughout the first half, with only a few leaps in logic towards the end, where some of the physics are more maleable. The dialogue ranges from stilted to quite engaging. The over-arching storyline has enough going on that I was fairly invested, though it did not bring much novelty. However, shortly after I worked through the aforementioned flaws, I began to really, REALLY, enjoy myself. The visuals are very effective and there is an ambience throughout the game that plucked at my fond memories of The Longest Journey. Yes, this game is flawed. Yes, the graphics cause delays and hangs. However, once you look past that, there is a really great game here (anyone remember the flawed, but fabulous, Soulbringer?). Well worth a budget price.Pros: Beautiful. Enjoyable puzzles. Fairly engaging story. Some of the voice acting. Solid musical score.Cons: Running it. Some of the voice acting. A few of the later puzzles.3.5 out of 5 Stars/Thumbs/Turnips			",128,63,1,13,7,2,17

“Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.” ~ G. K. Chesterton, quoted by Neil Gaiman, CoralineI only knew The Dark Eye series as a classic German pen and paper RPG until this point. After some research, I discovered that the realm of Aventuria has been turned into several cool pc games including Realms of Arkania and Drakensang RPG series respectively. But I've never dared to expect an adventure game that takes place in a FRP universe! It has been a satisfying change of pace for a fantasy lover such as myself: enjoying the contents of fantasy without venturing into battle.Our storyline takes place in humble beginnings, with Geron, the novice birdcatcher of the local ranger Gwinnling who lives in the silent medieval town of Andergast. Geron is considered to be cursed by the town populace, both disliked and feared with heavy prejudice due to an old prophet's dying words: ""you will bring great disaster to Angergast!"" Geron's unpleasant life takes an interesting turn though, when he is given the opportunity to get rid of the crows infesting castle's quarters. As he tries to attend this opportunity carefully, he meets Nuri, a fairy that will change his so far predictable life - and fate, forever... I'll try and put my experience on the table shortly: I loved every single moment of this game! Characters are original, the narration is exquisite, and the story is incredibly well-weaved! On a fair notice, the art works are singularly amazing enough to buy this game! It gave me the thrill of old adventure classics like Syberia or The Longest Journey. I found myself wondering the next bold move of our heroes in every pace, so I played the game in one single night!Puzzles vary between 'the logically expected' and 'the brink of insanity', which sets a tone for every single environment by itself. The context of the game consists of the marriage of two separate themes: the dreamlike, abstract nature of fantasy and the heavy, forlorn quest for philosophy comes together to portray the world of Aventuria, a world worthy of getting to know surely. If you consider yourself to be an adventure game player, please take note that this game - alongside its sequel, Memoria - are modern classics to the genre. You will not be disappointed!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			",353,800,0,204,86,0,63

												I'm getting tired of the binary system of steam reviews, it kind of guilt you into rating a game to ""yes"" if it is not a complete disaster and you enjoyed it at some level.I won't recommend Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav. It's not an horrible game, it's actually quite well done, it's just isn't good enough for me to recommend and I will tell you why.It's dull.The story in itself is ok, if a little weird, maybe because of the large amount of lore behind it which the game barely manage to convey. The characters are rather weak, the main character especially who in my opinion is very generic and boring, a sin he shares with many other characters in the game. The art is well done, with hand drawn backgrounds , but the colouring seemed a bit grey and forlorn for my tastes. The atmosphere in the game is ... weird. At first sight the cartoony look of the scenes and characters with the fairy magic and classic poor peasant boy making it in a knight world is almost Walt Disney-ish. But it's a lot darker, people get maimed and killed in horrible ways one moment, then the main character make a lighthearted joke the next. The game doesn't seem to make it's mind wether it want to be nice and cartoony or dark and repressive and it's rather confusing. Some gothic games manage to handle those two mindsets well enough but in the Dark eye, it's more of a mess, it comes out as unfunny and uncaring. .The puzzles themselves are pretty good, although not revolutionnary, the break\fix abilities the main characters has on object is interesting . Technically nothing much to say, although the graphics seem to be a bit slow especially in the cutscenes, nothing dealbreaking, but a slight annoyance.I still played through the whole game, as a whole it's mediocre but It's definively ok , and if you're desperate for an adventure game and it's on sale, go for it. But there are better games out there in my mind.			",192,88,1,44,13,0,24

												The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is one great point-and-click adventure.Gamplay 8 of 10You collect and combine various items, solve some tough and some not so tough riddles. Sometimes the game makes you backtrack because you forgot some small detail and sometimes the solution of the riddle is just a little way off, so be aware that you can't really fast play the game without reading a walkthrough. Music 8 of 10 Really fitting fantasy, sometimes ethereal soundtrack. Solid work. The voice acting is really top notch and sometimes the dialogues will make you laugh out loud. Starting with the hard haggling dwarf to the knight in shining armor. Big comedy.Graphics 7.5 of 10Very detailed background graphics, you can tell it was done with a lot of love for the game. Still they could have pushed it some.Story      8.5 of 10The story is engaging and makes you want to play through fast because you really care about the characters and want to know what's about to happen next to them. You play Gereon the bird catcher and all of a sudden you find yourself confronted with bad omens, mysterious deaths and strange dreams. But Gereon with his wit will find a way to save the day, even if it means stealing someone’s golden oak leaf...Final verdictA very engaging little tale with some really challenging puzzles. Maybe a little too tough for beginners of the genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I definitely recommend this game. To whom? To anyone who appreciates art. This is several paintings in interactive form. Not for those who just want to shoot stuff.Why should you buy it?-As an introduction to Memoria, the sequel. You'll get to know the characters, and get the references in Memoria. -Clever puzzles. Some are perfectly logical and relatively easy, while others defy logic (faerie realm) or are just too convoluted. Walkthrough will be needed. Sometimes its just a tiny little detail that eludes you (a thing that had to be broken). They are, however, still worthwhile and enjoyable.-Good story! Its a nice adventure to have, meeting colorful characters, discovering many things, traveling to strange places and ultimately saving your hometown. Reminds me of the Chronicles of Narnia.-Unique. Like its sequel, there is no other game quite like this out there. -The visuals. The artists did an amazing job. While the puzzles in the faerie world are impossible to understand, the surreal art is wonderful. Is anything bad?-The lipsynching is broken. They fixed this in the sequel.-The music is lacking or non-existant in many locations. They also fixed this in the sequel I believe.-Some puzzles defy logic and may require a walkthrough for most to solve. They are not kidding when they give you ''impossible'' challenges. A hint system, such as in Machinarium, would of been appreciated.-Animations are crude, often making the game stall for a moment, disrupting the immersion.-Severak voice actors can be pretty annoying, especially the talking crow. Also, get used to almost every character hating your guts (its linked to the story though). The main town, Andergast, is pretty depressing (its pretty small too).-Pretty short, especially if you use a walkthrough. It might take you a while to figure out the puzzles though. I personnaly gave up on that to breeze through and see the artwork!Can't really give this a rating. Its a matter of taste.Hope this review helped you out! ",350,122,2,27,9,0,15

												This game is well above average for the point-and-click genre of games.  It, like the sequel, weaves a beautiful story with beautiful artwork and music, and is well worth picking up (""Memoria"" is the sequel and is also available on Steam).  Like all of this genre, there are some things to figure out which aren't necessarily intuitive, which can be frustrating.  This is no worse than any similar game, however, and didn't detract from my enjoyment of the game.The interface and inventory are very easy to use, which is much appreciated in a land of complicated inventory management and skill systems and perplexing (at best) UIs.  For this genre, less is more in terms of making a player jump through hoops to work the interface.  This game does just fine at that.I've heard others say that the story isn't anything unique, but as I've never run into a story quite like this before, I'll politely disagree.  There are some of the usual fantasy game tropes, but the overall story felt brand new to me.  At least personally, I felt it was a beautiful story with some parts that were heartbreaking (caveat: I am a softie, so I might be more emotionally invested in the story than some are!).The characters were all nicely handled; I especially loved Nuri's simple naivete, which the writers made work nicely by not confusing simplicity with stupidity.  She is not stupid, even when her innocence about the ""human"" world gets her into trouble, and even when her inclination towards trusting everyone works against her.  ""Your humans are angry with me, Geron!"" she says after opening the cages of a town's entire animal population.  Her bafflement is endearing.The artistry of the scenery and backgrounds is what really impressed me through both of my plays through.  The attention to detail and sheer beauty of some of the backdrop scenes really showed hard work on the part of the illustrators, and I respect that.  I have some screenshots uploaded from this game just because there were parts I went full-on tourist with the camera.TL;DR: one of my very favorite games of the genre, beautifully done in terms of character, art, and music, and well worth picking up, along with the sequel, Memoria.

												This is a game that I started probably a year ago, then got distracted by other games, and finally came back to a few days ago and finished. What does that say about this game? Not too much....I started this on the heels of playing a couple other point and clicks such as Primordia and realized that I wasn't ready to commit the time to it at that point. Recently, I started really craving a good point and click tough, so I came back to the game, and I am glad I did. Set in the Dark Eye universe (which many other games such as the Drakensangs, Blackguards also hail), gives it a sort of muted, middle ages with mysticism feel to it, which held true in this game. It's a really interesting setting in my opinion. You play as Geron, a bird catchers apprentice whose master is slain for his participation in the burning of an evil prophet 13 years prior to the events of the game, and his knowledge of the presumed dead prophets plans to destroy the world as we (they) know it. This is actually not dissimilar to the Blackguards story line actually. Anyway, you end up meeting and falling in love with a beautiful faerie and embark on an adventure to save the world, even though you really don't know how. The story finishes with room for a sequel, but with enough resolution to not require it, which was a nice way to handle it.So, this is a point and click adventure. How does it stack up? I felt it was pretty good overall. There were a couple frustratingly difficult puzzles (most notably in the faerie realm, for me at least) and a few super simple puzzles, but most were just right: they required some thought and trial and error, but not to the point of frustration or leaving you feeling bored. I thought it did what it intended overall, and was pretty well par for the Daedalic course. It didnt really stray from their adventure formula, but managed to stay interesting the whole way through.All told, I would give it 7 out of 10. Nothing too extraordinary, but a pretty good game overall.			",2041,1027,52,317,205,18,280

												This game took me 10 hours to beat, But with walkthroughs will take conciderable less time.  + Unlike other point an click adventures the tasks that need to be performed directly mix with the story at hand. I am personally not a fan of the A to B to C trading you do in some other point and clicks.+ This point and click adventure likes to keep things simple early on before it opens up bigger corridors later on. The progression is pretty good to get used to the game. + The story is very good and the world has great lore.+ Great ambience and music will make you care about this dark fantasy world.+ No bugs+ Unlike other point & clicks : items will be grayed out when its uses are exhausted, this will point you in the right direction eventually if you were to get stuck.+- You cannot actually ""lose"" in the game.- No reason for replayability, No community around the game for artwork or modding.- Ending of the story is good but could have been longer.- Game start's pretty abruptly, intro too short.- Protagonist is a bit bland compared to all the other characters.- Deus Ex Machina is used a few times throughout the story for a plot-twist. ( I do not mind it since it is a fantasy world, but some others do not like this)- Game is rather expensive, add it to your favourites and pick it up when you get emailed by steam that it is on sale.- Unlike other point & clicks : some useless items are kept after use in your inventory, even though they do not serve any other purpose anymore in the current area. This clogs up your inventory.Summary : The Dark Eye : Chains of Satinav is an underrated point and click adventure game. The game is quickly forgettable, but to those enjoying a dark fantasy world the story and lore of this world will stay with you.			",150,41,4,20,16,1,31

												At first, I wasn't really convinced, but I kept playing and quickly fell in love with this incredible point and click adventure.

												I don't usually play point-and-click games, I find them boring and sometimes even tedious.However, this game caught my attention with it's elaborate art style, and soon after playing it, i discovered to my pleasant surprise, some of the most interesting gaming characters I've had the pleasure of exploring.The greatest hook though, was the extremely immersive world that constantly kept me entranced, and feeling as if there was always something going on behind the main story.Overall, I would recommend this title for the peculiar and interesting world, with amazing characters and story.

												Disclaimer: This is going to read more like an article than a review, since I have a lot to say.What an experience...and to think I almost didn't play this. It all started a while ago when I saw how amazing the game looked, and that was all I needed to buy it. The first few times I tried it, I just couldn't shake feeling that this beautiful game was dull. So, I put it away. Some time later, I played Blackguards, a strategy RPG which takes place in the Dark Eye universe. To my surprise (strategy is not my usual forte'), I loved it! With the knowledge of how exciting Adventuria could be, I was ready to take another stab at The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav. All I can say is.....well a lot.First, I want to deal with the story. Don't worry I won't give any of it away, since it would take too long. Suffice it to say, the game starts very calmly and yes maybe even a little boring. However when Geron the birdcatcher meets Nuri, things quickly change, changing the story into a dark, serious, and sometimes playful adventure. The lore in this game is very well done, for a point&click. Things we take for granted in fairy tale/ fantasy worlds are not always what they seem in this game. For example,  Nuri is a fairy who finds herself in the human world. She is determined not to go back to her fairy kingdom . Thats a plot point that I found to be unique, and opens up a lot of questions. I really enjoyed the story, which is huge really. Well to enjoy the story, you have to like the characters, and I loved them. Geron, admittedly, is a character we have all seen before. He is the social outcast who is labeled by superstitious, small minded people and it plagues him wherever he goes. He is always trying to prove that he is not out to destroy the kingdom. Even though it's a fimiliar character type, I liked Geron. The English voice actor I believe did a good job portraying the struggle that Geron has, throughout the game. Then there is Nuri...again we have seen her before. A fairy (yeah fairies don't need wings in this game) who is excited about the human world and wants to see everything with Geron. Not an original character concept, but Nuri is so genuine, innocent, and loving that you won't care. The relationship between Geron and Nuri is genuine. Honestly, if the chemistry between these two aren't felt, then the game fails. Do I even have to go into how this game looks? It's gorgeous, unique, and the best 2D hand drawn game I've seen. Period. If all P&C fantasy games were Disney movies, this is the Lord of the Rings/Willow version of a P&C fantasy game. The look and sounds (gorgeous soundtrack) of this game gives it that epic, big, serious, vibe that I've never seen before. But then again, I haven't played Memoria yet....Now the game mechanics. Yes it works like most modern day P&C's. You all know how to use a mouse. Geron and Nuri use minor magic spells in order to solve puzzles sometimes, which I found to be fresh. There are times, when Geron has conversations with Nuri that will change how she sees him, but it doesn't do anything to change the overrall ending. The puzzles are a mixed bag of fairly easy to having to sit down and think. I would probably not suggest this game to a new P&C adventurer, although there are some things in the game to help. There is a button you can push to see all the objects you can interact with, therefore cutting scanning the screen. Some of the puzzles near the end are hard, HOWEVER the game does tell you everything you need to know in order to solve it. Depending on the person, this could take some thought. There were times I used a walkthrough, but that was mainly because I was eager to continue the story.Overrall, this was a wonderful experience. I know I will be playing this again to pick up the missed achievements. Also, I will come back to revisit characters I enjoyed and a world that I wish I could access through my backyard.UPDATE:  After this review, I played through Memoria. If you would like to know what I thought of the continuation of this great story click http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/243200 !			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a point & click adventure game that's not easy to review. There are both good and bad things to say about every single aspect of this game. For example, the graphics. The backgrounds are very nice. But character animation is just awkward. And every time any of the characters is talking, you'd swear the developers did everything they could to make sure the character's mouth never fits the words being spoken. It's uncanny!Or take the voice acting: some of it is very decent and some of it is almost cringeworthy.I felt another duality with the setting, the story and the characters. They certainly showed a basic charm that made me want to continue playing for the better part of the game. But after a while I found that The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav never went beyond that basic charm: the story never unfolded much after the basic premise was explained at the beginning of the game, the characters never showed any real depth although there seemed to be plenty of room for that, and at the end the story just seemed to drag on as if the game had outstayed its welcome.Same for the puzzles. In the first half of the game, the puzzles are logical and therefore fun to solve. After that, more and more puzzles are far-fetched and therefore frustrating to solve. The only way to solve some of the later puzzles would be to just try everything on everything, or to look up a guide. Both options mean taking away a considerable part of the fun of playing an adventure game. Sure, you can use a 'hint' button, marking all the objects you can interact with. But there's a Steam Achievement for not using that button a lot, so you end up not using it at all if you want the achievement. Also, the problem is almost never that you missed an object you can interact with, but that you just can't guess what the developers were thinking. The solution usually is going back and talking to everyone and clicking with every item on every object you can interact with... again... and again after that. You see, there are a lot of 'preconditions' to this game's puzzles. Often you realize what you need to do but you can't perform an action until you did something else or talked to someone again. Often it was clear to me what I was supposed to do but Geron couldn't do it... yet, so off I went looking to fulfil the precondition, which often had its own preconditions. In the end, this results in a lot of 'trying everything on everything' over and over again, until you get the 'chain of events' right, exactly according to the progressive scheme the developers had in mind.It doesn't help that the game itself gives you contradictory clues. Two examples: You click on a plant. The text reads ""Fire seems to scare this plant"". But Geron says: ""The plant doesn't seem to be troubled by fire"". There are two basins. You can adjust the way the water flows from one basin to another. If you walk to the upper basin, Geron gets smaller. Walk to the lower basin and Geron gets bigger. How do you make an item smaller? Yup, by making the water flow from the upper to the lower basin and by putting the item in the upper basin and letting it flow down into the lower basin.The duality of every aspect of The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav makes it a game you can both love and hate simultaneously. So do I recommend it or not? Well, I'll leave you with some quotes I picked from other reviews that reflect my opinion on this game perfectly. In the spirit of the first quote, which I understand completely, I'll be one to offset the balance a bit by not giving it a 'thumbs up'.It is by no means a bad game mind you, but it is not a very good one either. I think a lot of people have given it a thumbs up just because it isn't bad, and I am going to do the same. ---J3ST3RIts puzzles suffer from the typical point-and-click adventure trap of if you get it, you get it, but if you don't, you'll be really stuck. All in all, a good but not great game.---Aria TheoNot terrible, if you get it on sale.---Space Thiefok game, but not something that will leave you wanting for more---Erebus(...)the puzzles (as expected of a Daedalic game) range from ""just right"" to ""just stupid hard"" ---bUm805Puzzles vary between 'the logically expected' and 'the brink of insanity'---Faudraline(...)the puzzles, mostly reasonably challenging, are sometime simplistic and then, in two cases totally obtuse and, for sure, require the use of a walkthrough.---Sttark(...)since we're in the age of the internet, if you're stuck, you can look up a guide online to help you get past a part of the game where you are stuck. And I'll be the first to confess this is what I did---AtratzuI thought it dragged on a bit.

												After playing some of the other games available these days and seeing the prices they are charging I have to change my initial recommendation for this game.  There is a lot of content hear for you to explore and the story is a little weak at times, but overall it has a solid amount of challenging puzzles and interesting environments for you to interact with.The reason I rated it down at first and my continuing problems with it are that the puzzles often have an element to them that requires you to pixel hunt the screens for quite some time to find them or use the hint feature (essentially cheating for a player who plays these kinds of games a lot).  One or two is fine, but the consistency of the issue left a bad taste in my mouth.  The other issue I had was that the main characters were very unlikable to me.  Especially the protagonist.  While a bit of negativity and ""anti-hero"" character can lend some authenticity to an otherwise cardboard cutout, he was downright miserable and his choices that I could not control left me with little sympathy for him or connection to him.The reason I have redone this review is that, fundamentally, this was a good game marred with exactly the kind of things that can ruin a game for me.  However, they are MY buttons and after stepping back a bit it is clear that they were really not enough for a bad recommendation. ",1009,704,3,250,95,7,241

												The Good: + Beautiful backgrounds that bring the world to life + Variety of unique locations set in a fantasy world+ The story starts off a bit fast and confusing, but begins to make more sense the further along you go.  + The puzzles make sense and find the right mix between fair and challenging. Although like every adventure game there are some that will test your patience. The puzzles are integrated well with the story. + Option to toggle hotspots on/off to help you. EVERY point and click adventure game should have this feature. + Lengthy adventure+ Great voice acting+ Good Soundtrack+ Easy achievementsThe Bad- ending is very anticlimactic ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												I'm going to recommend this game, but just barely.FIrst off, I beat it, and I'm a very casual point and click gamer. Loved ""Kings quest"" and ""space quest"" as a kid, loved ""to the moon"" more recently. This is a review for people looking at the sale, but are only moderate point and click fans.FIrst off, the game's visual 2D backgrounds look stunning. thats the first and main thing you'll notice. It looks like they used 2D backgounds with 3D avatars on top for the characters. The artwork team was very good, and original in its design. The only qualm I have visually is sometimes the avatars are choppy and the speaking narratives sometimes aren't synced very well, ie: their mouth simply justs moves as the voice actor voices the lines. Very distracting at best, and story breaking at its worst.The story is very good, which is why point and click games shine. Geron (Protagonist) comes off as a bit whiney, but he's fairly lovable by the end of the story. He kinda reminds me of an emo peasant a little bit, but he's alright. Nuri (supporting character, and love intrest??) is very naive, but is kind of adorable, and is an excellent contrast to Geron. Without Nuri, Geron would have been unbearable, but her cheeriness brings the development along well, and can also be a source of comedy relief at times.There are many difficult puzzles!!! This is where the amatuer point and click fan should be aware! I had my phone open almost constantly with a guide while playing because I hate being stuck for more than five minutes (hey thats just the world we live in) there were a few times I used the guide and scratched my head saying ""Who the hell would get that without help!?"" So if you do decide to buy and play, its okay to use a guide and still be a hardcore gamer! I've beat portal, dark sould 1, and 2 and demon souls, etc. If you listen and talk to people while exploring everything you'll mostly be okay, its when you have 25 items in your inventory that things get tricky as some tasks require 6-10 items in a proper sequence to do properly :( not difficult guys, just punishing. Difficult games are fun, not punishing...But I digress, the biggest dissapointment comes at the end, I won't spoil it but its kinda frustrating to get no closure from a ten hour game, like literally no dialogue is spoken by the main characters after the antagonist is defeated.Worth it for the casual gamer, but not perfect!

												The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a beautiful point-and-click adventure game set in a universe that I am personally new to, though it claims to be popular in Europe, and I have little doubt of that. Although I am not new to the point-and-click genre, I've spent about 20+ years neglecting it while playing other genres of games, and haven't played point-and-click adventure games extensively since freeware titles on DOS systems back in the early '90s. This game was the first game of the genre I've beaten since then, so take that as you wish to.There are two difficulty settings for the game, and after you choose one, it starts right off introducing you to the main character, Geron. Geron is a bird catcher by trade, and you quickly learn that he is mostly unliked due to the bad luck that always seems to follow him. There are crows that begin to settle in Geron's home village, Andergast, and with the crows come terrible dreams that plague its residents. There is talk among the populace that this is no coincidence, and that a man they once thought was banished is making a comeback. Adventure ensues as your character gets caught up in the drama.The game, as mentioned earlier, is beautiful. It's a joy to wander through this land, screen by screen, and the varied nature of the art does make it feel like you are truly on an adventure. The puzzles range from ""duh"" to ""I need a walkthrough,"" and I did find that there were a few where after I'd solve them, I'd look back on the resolution and still not understand why what I did worked. It definitely fell victim a few times to the same thing many in the genre do, of having solutions that don't quite make practical sense. For the most part, however, the puzzles make logical sense. The characters, particularly Geron and his eventual sidekick, Nuri, have personalities that play off each other well. However, I did find Nuri to be pretty annoying during a few parts of the game. She's extraordinarily gullible and daft, and sometimes her decisions lead to chapters of Geron trying to fix her mistakes. To make matters worse, she has a habit of laughing at him, which felt condescending toward Geron, especially since his character is the one to solve the majority of the game. Story-wise, I enjoyed the world and its lore, however, the relationship between the two main characters seems more forced than anything (with Geron feeling he needs to protect Nuri no matter the costs, despite the fact that they're strangers in the beginning). So while the story was intriguing, the loyalty our main character has to it was unbelievable at times.The gameplay works as expected of the genre, and there were a few parts of the game where the point-and-click gameplay is incorporated into a type of cutscene, which was pretty unique to me. There were sometimes more than one solution to a puzzle, and at times your actions (or lack thereof) could change the story in subtle ways, earning you an achievement for one decision or another. Speaking of achievements, for those who care, you will have to beat the game at least twice (once on each difficulty) to earn them all, and a walkthrough is necessary for some. For example, there's an achievement for using a certain spell 50 times, and without seeing that mentioned in the walkthrough, I wouldn't have known it (the achievements aren't very clear in how you can earn them) and I also wouldn't have gotten it (you won't normally use the spell 50 times in a playthrough, and maybe not even in two). Many achievements simply will not be earned unless you know beforehand about them and where in the game you can earn them, and it was a little odd that such a decision was implemented in this game.Overall, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav was a fun romp through a new fantasy universe, and makes me happy that I picked up the Dark Eye Armageddon Bundle back during the summer sale, as I have more to experience. It truly did make me feel like I was on an adventure, which is what I missed about this genre. However, it does have its flaws, and falls victim to some of the tropes point-and-click games are known for. Considering all of its points, I'm giving the game a 7/10. It is truly above average, and I'd suggest this game to both fans of point-and-clicks and gamers who'd like an introduction to the genre.			",461,269,16,130,96,2,166

												The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is the first point ‘n’ click adventure game set in the Dark Eye universe. The plot follows the protagonist, Geron, who tries to rescue his town from a catastrophe and has to face many obstacles on his quest. He eventually meets this forrest fairy, Nuri, who he has to protect as she is one of the reasons why grim things start to happen in the lands of Aventuria. Initially it may look like a light-hearted story, but the tone deviates from that soon enough.Now, the art is simply brilliant, no doubt about that. The hand-drawn/painted backdrops are definitely worthy of a praise as they set an unique vibe and aesthetic to the game. In actual fact, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav has, at least, some of the best detailed 2D visuals in a point ‘n’ click game to date. It would have been even better having most of its environments more interactive to enhance the experience. The soundtrack is also lovely as each track fits perfectly with each scene and sets the mood accordingly.But honestly, that is as much as the game can be lauded for as everything else is either average or beyond mediocre. The story, characters and puzzles have glaring issues which put a toll on my patience and made me uninstall the game just when I was a bit over halfway through. I simply could not stand it any longer.Firstly, the story is a mixed bag for a fairytale setting. It has a few interesting moments, but these are overshadowed by the amount of monotonous events. Admittedly, the concept seems interesting enough to hold your attention longer than it should, but its writing can be shoddy every now and then. This aspect plagued the game with many pacing issues resulting in this agonisingly slow momentum in the narrative. Things pick up so slowly that you could easily fall asleep on your chair. Personally, the plot did not captivate me at all, and instead it progressively made me try to rush towards the ending as soon as possible. As mentioned previsouly, I quit before I got to the ending, so I have no idea if things get better. 7 hours in felt already too late for things to get appealing in my opinion though.Additionally, the main protagonists are generally unlikable. They are boring, wimpy and lack personal charms. Not only that, but the fairy companion, Nuri, that you have to protect and escort up to a point in the story is borderline unbearable. I do not know if the writers' intention was to make her actually sound autistic, but I believe they succeeded to some degree by accident. At least that is the vibe that I got from her during every conversation. It does not help that the English voice acting is also dull as a lot of characters talk too whispery and without much energy in voice projection.Lastly, the puzzles are fairly easy in the beginning and should not pose a problem to veterans of the genre, but they eventually become unintuitive and leave the player wondering what to do next in more than a couple of occasions. Therefore, do not be surprised getting stuck a couple of times later on. One interesting mechanic, though, is the ability to break or fix objects through a magic power which adds an extra layer of challenge in solving certain puzzles. Whilst this is nothing radically innovative, the mechanic is commendable as otherwise the gameplay is the same as in any standard point ‘n’ click adventure game from the past few decades. Sadly, it is only used a few times and not always in the most creative ways.In conclusion, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav had a lot of potential to be at least an engaging point ‘n’ click adventure game set in an already established lore (famously known in Germany), but its agonisingly slow pacing and painfully dull (English) voice acting are the two most prominent sins in this game which suck the majority of the enjoyment -- and closely followed by some of the characters and puzzles. Besides the break/fix mechanic, the game’s gameplay simply does not attempt to challenge the standard already set by the genre since the '90s. Although there is nothing utterly wrong with that, this means that both the story and puzzles, which are both average at best, have to carry the game – and The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav does not succeed in either of them. Much like the developer’s other franchise, Deponia, I was initially captivated by its unique visuals which led me to purchase this game in the first place. Now I wish I knew how mediocre the content is underneath that vibrant coat of paint. At this stage, I do not care how the story ends anymore as I simply could not enjoy the ride and do not want to revisit it. I might watch it on YouTube instead, some day. I cannot recommend this game unless you have an enormous amount of patience and tolerance. If so, I admire you.			",457,209,7,77,41,6,76

												A pretty solid adventure game released under The Dark Eye brand (a big role-playing brand in Europe). This is my first encounter with the lore involved with TDE brand, and personally I am bit torn. It is fairly well written and has a lot of backstory but really had a hard time getting invested in the game and often had to push myself to continue playing the game.The achievements are decent and mixes straight up storyline achievement with some very specific achievements (such as finding hidden references to their other games or doing things in various ways). A big thing is that the game has achievements for beating the game on both the two difficulties of the game so you need to beat the game twice, as a minimum.Time to 100%: 10-12+ hours			",943,372,36,86,96,14,164

												A Point & Click Adventure game, with a Fantasy setting.The graphics/ art was good, the music was good, & the story, which was the best part, was also very good. The gameplay is typical for this type of game, & was (yep) good. Nothing overly mind-blowingly-special, but good is good.Most of the puzzles were easy to work-out with a bit of thought, although i did get stuck a few times & looked online for answers, but i was impatient to move the story on.It's around 6hrs long (x2 for all Achevo's).I got it for $2 during a 90% Off sale, so that was great value, but the normal $20 price tag, is too-much.If u like Point & Click Adventure game, & don't mind that it's not a detective story, i'd sugest putting it on your WishList, & waiting until it gets a decent discount.Overall: 6.5/ 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chains of Satinav, I never heard of this game before, bought it on sale for obvious reason, cheap. But, oh boy, I glad I bought it. This game has unique art style, they are pretty, art and story are the strong points of this game. But unfortunately, I got serious fps drops first time starting this game, but there is a solution for that, just disable the texture compression from the config tool. You control Geron, a bird catcher who can do 1 magic trick, destroying small, fragile things, as the story goes, you will embark on a journey to save your loved fairy, Nuri from the grasp of the Seer and to prevent the destruction of Andergast. It's simple, but the journey is what makes it best, in addition, the voice actors are superb, almost every characters in this game is memorable, excluding the gate guard and the scholar gate guard. Get it on sale or full price, either one, the game deserves it. You can finish it in 15 hours without guide or 7 hours with guide. And you have to play the game twice to get all the achievements.

												A beautiful adventure. The strongest elements to me are the gorgeous art, nice music and great voice acting. Nuri and Geron in particular are two wonderful characters. Their voice actors sound so nice, soothing, believable and powerful. They can be cute, funny, heartwearming, sad. It's just a joy listening to them or to be there to witness and kinda share their pain. I don't know if I had ever heard emotions projected so well only through voice between two characters. I'd love to hear them in a third The Dark Eye game, and I think it must be these two doing it close together because I am hearing them in another game, the ""Game of Thrones"" RPG, in more isolated roles but they just won't strike me there as much. Perhaps it's their skills and the script working magic here in combination - it looks like they were given a nice amount of freedom, or at the very least it sounds as if they were wholeheartedly enjoying their roles. The puzzling is less diverse than in Memoria (= the sequel) but still fine in it's own, traditional right as far as I can tell. I'd say it's of the easier (not easiest, but average) kind as you won't always have dozens of items to handle and the solutions aren't as absurd as they can be for example in Deponia. You can have points of interest in the world highlighted by the press of a button, and there is a combination helper that has item labels showing up in either blue or white color depending on whether you can still do something with them or not. This mechanic was dropped in Memoria it seems, maybe because randomly using the little to average numbers of items you have works just quicker than memorizing this color coding.The only flaws of this game I came to notice are some technical hiccups; between actions there can be very brief ""freezes"" which didn't annoy me but which I heard one or another player complain about on the hub. This is nothing to lament over too much I believe though because there are no real-time action scenes that would require you to have everything work totally fluently. Which is a bit unfortunate is that, like in Memoria, audio and text will not always align, at least not when playing in English. Some lines in certain scenes may appear in text or audio which simply don't belong there but to previous ones, or one or another sentence wasn't translated properly from German (the native language of the devs) to English. This doesn't happen brutally often, but it does on some occasions and you'll notice.What works better here than in Memoria is the the journey/adventure log, which is a relatively simply book with a short text what had happened and what you are about to do, roughly, with a world map indicating where you are (roughly as well - not that it would matter much because the game has you go through specific locations, you won't be travelling around the world by your own merit).Also, the ending felt a little rushed; beautiful and fitting in some ways, but I was surprised it came as quickly as it did, and there isn't much of an epilogue either, which would have left me ""unsaturated"" if not for the fact that there is already a sequel which properly continues and somewhat ends what was started in Chains of Satinav.

												When I launched ‘Chains of Satinav’ for the first time my, expectations have been pretty high. The game set in an almost legendary fantasy setting of ""Dark Eye"" (in some countries it's even more popular than 'Dungeons&Dragons' !), and above all an adventure, not RPG one, to me seemed like a guaranteed success.Despite minor flaws like surprisingly low frame rate, and a few resolution problems, I've started the story, and meet our Hero for the first time. In ‘Chains of Satinav’ we take up a role of Geron, a young bird-catcher who bravely stands against dark forces threatening his home town of Andergast. The narrative we follow is a solid piece of work, with some surprising plot twists and believable, memorable characters. Not only the fully voiced dialogues, so important in adventure games, but also the world itself are designed with a great care for details making the whole journey a pleasant and memorable experience.The riddles that fill the world of 'TDE: Chains of Satinav' are pretty good, some of them really witty, but overall not hard enough to discourage You from finishing the game. A huge plus is the fact, that they’re all pretty much logical chains of actions, which prevents typical adventure-game puzzle rage. An unique addition to the common point and click mechanics are two special 'talents' that Geron can use to his aid. Our particular bird-catcher is capable of breaking, and later even fixing some fragile objects, which allows him to solve some of the harder puzzles.“TDE: Chains of Satinav” is a great adventure game, with beautifully drawn backgrounds and captivating story. The puzzles although not that hard, may provide just enough challenge to prevent You from blitzing through the game. Another great feature is an atmospheric music, perfectly accompanying Geron's adventures and enriching the whole experience.Pros:-	A very good narrative with believable characters.-	Set in a vast fantasy setting of ‘Dark Eye’-	Need at least two play troughs to get all mutually exclusive achievements.-	Unique atmosphere created by hand-drawn stills and amazing music.-	Sequel already in store (check ‘Memoria’)Cons:-	Surprisingly low Frame Rate.-	Some common problems reported with game freezeing and resolution.-	Puzzles are not that much of a challenge.

												Thrilling and intresting fantasy point-&-click Quest.Story of usual street guy & birdcatcher.Game have very plot with intresting story turning point's. Voice acting was not bad and suits greatly to immerse into the dark & rich Dark Eye universe.Despite game have numerous different puzzle's, it also have good hint's to help player solve everything without walkthrough (combination and spot indicators). Only obstacle, which delayed me for days was 12-ve god's puzzle.Only thing, which I dislike was unchanging resolution...Most of achivement's are easy, but some of them really diehard thing (as example healer/destroyer and lightboard operator), I advise to use save many as you can, especiaaly when you enter a new area - to not complete game twice.

												MediocreAs of the time of this review this game is rated very positive on Steam. I have a funny feeling that if the rating system had been more than a yes/no system it would stand differently. It is by no means a bad game mind you, but it is not a very good one either. I think a lot of people have given it a thumbs up just because it isn't bad, and I am going to do the same.Seeing that this is the first time I enter the lore of The Dark Eye, I can not say much about how true it is to the lore or how significant it is in that sense. The game doesn't seem to open much of the lore to the player and it rather feels like just a backdrop to the story we play through. The story in this game seems slightly interesting, but I feel it could have been a lot more fleshed out. It is all very isolated and intimate. For someone who's more into this universe it might do alot, I wouldn't know, but for everyone else I think it is very thin.That being said, as a stand alone adventure game I'd say this game is mediocre. It feels a little dull and flat. Much because of the setting and also because of some of the voice-acting of the main characters being unengaging. It's sad really, as you do meet a few characters that are voiced really well, and the narrator's voice is great.  The main character does not seem to be liked by many of the inhabitants, but one never really gets to know why. As a bird-catcher in a town overrun by birds one would think they'd appreciate you a bit more. There are a lot of good things too though. The handpainted backgrounds are fantastic and there is a lot of great ideas here. The puzzles are logical and on the most part quite good and creative even though it can feel a bit outlandish at times. There are achievements in this game, but sadly most of them are the ""click this thing a 100 times and turn this 20 times"". I find achievements like that a chore and very little creative. Also, to get them all you have to play through the game twice on different difficulties which is just not worth it. Other achievements include doing certain things differently, so a tip to all would be to save often and reload when one of the achievements is..uhm....achieved.This game is a predecessor to the game Memoria and it is probably worth playing through to lay the foundations if you want to play that game. Other than that I only think it can serve as a timekiller or filler inbetween other games. I would not recommend the game to anyone who for the first time would enter into the world of point 'n' click adventure games, there are many many games that I would consider a whole lot better for that purpose. But, for established adventure fans it could be worth a playthrough, especially seeing you'd probably be able to get this game really cheap in a sale.I give it a rating of 5/10. Just mediocre.This opinion is of course highly subjective and your opinion might differ from mine. If you plan on buying it do not use this review as a sole source for that purpose, rather make sure to read several reviews before making up your mind.Thanks for taking the time to read this review.Happy gaming :o)TJ			",703,637,38,102,124,8,148

												Nice adventure with around 15 hours of playtime and puzzles of easy to intermediate difficulty. When I had to look into the walkthrough it was always because I missed talking to another character another time, because it matters WHEN you talk to people. A lot of times you must have done one particular thing to be able to take the next step in conversations.The story is nice though not exciting, the ending leaves you unimpressed. I didn't like the characters very much in regards of design and there is no character which seems very likeable to me. The main character misses depth and the elf is a child-like char which can be annoying. German speakers are not ear candy, I didn't try the original.On the other hand the many landscapes / scenes and objects are designed very beautifully and it's a breathe that animations and loading times are very fast. The player character moves fast from scene to scene and with a doubleclick you switch between scenes instantly. The overall controls are straight forward, easy peasy.Uh and you can use the knive actually more than twice. Same with many other stuff in the inventory so this adventure is ahead of most others in that point.Achievements are of course easy but they don't make sense a lot of times so I decided to just not care about them. The creators didn't try to be creative about them. Look in the walkthrough, otherwise there's no chance to get them all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a nice addition for anyone who´s into the point-n-click genre. Even though I´m not familiar with the Dark Eye World I found it an interesting setting. The story line is by no means original but the narrative still feels solid and keeps you as a player interested in seeing how the story will play out.As other reviewers have done I will also recommend playing the game on hard difficulty since the game does become a bit to easy when played on easy with the help modes enabled. The main use I see for the easy difficulty is for those who wishes to play the game more like a visual novel, since the story and narrative is good this is a viable option. I found most of the puzzles to make sense and only the Fairy World may be considered a bit out of the ordinary in that department. The inclusion of a break/repair option was great since it creates more possibilities for item combinations without having to add more items to find in game.On graphics one have to mention the backgrounds which look amazing and the character models are also great to look at when they are stationary. The animations are however not that good and both movement and facial expressions are jerky while the lip-sync in dialogues is even worse. Since one does get used to the faults and still get´s to enjoy the beautiful backgrounds the total impression on graphics is still very positive.Music/Audio is for the most time quite nice even though I did find the protagonist Geron to be a bit whiny in the first chapters of the game. He does seem to mature or rather face up to the challenge as the game progresses which is a nice touch. The other characters, both minor and major ones, are well voice acted and adds to the overall positive experience when playing the game.In short I will recommend this game for fans of the point-n-click game genre and I would also view it as a good game for those who does not have much experience with puzzle games but want to try one out. The full prize of 20 € does feel a bit steep since the game is not that long but at a sale it´s good time value.			",317,201,5,71,48,3,53

-Quick Review-The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a point and click adventure game with fantasy and dramatic themes. It was developed by Daedalic Entertainment and released Jun 22, 2012.


This game is definiting winning me over. Even if I am a bit slower then most when it comes to point-and-click adventure games.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav takes place in the kingdom of Andergast, you play as the protagonist young Geron, a bird catcher by trade, but more well known as ""the child who will bring doom"".You see, before the story even starts, poor Geron was cursed by the Seer, and so everyone in town thinks that he brings bad luck wherever he goes. Little does he realize what kind of adventure he's about to go on... But none ever to realize their journeys in these types of stories.I don't want to give too much away of the story, because that's the driving factor of a point and click adventure game (well, that and the puzzles. but the STORY is what compelled me to solve the puzzles)Gameplay: If you've never played a point and click adventure game, it's the science of clicking on one thing, and then clicking on another thing, and then clicking on one thing with every item in your inventory.Thankfully, since we're in the age of the internet, if you're stuck, you can look up a guide online to help you get past a part of the game where you are stuck. And I'll be the first to confess this is what I did, I was able to puzzle my way through the first two-thirds of the game... But once the Fairy chapter started... Well... Lets say I had an epiphany: the developers of this game are insane.Insane or no, I had forgotten the satisfaction of solving a puzzle by yourself without any help... except I can't even brag about that, because I played on the ""easy"" mode, which gives you a hint button to show all the things you can click on. This definitely is the only reason I completed so much of the game by myself, but I honestly I ended up spamming the heck out of the button and forgetting to use my own eyes.Point-and-click adventure games are a genre I haven't experienced since.... Some point and click adventure kid game for the Muppet Treasure Island. (So please be gentle with me, veterans.)


A talking bird? So far this game is batting a great score, with fantastic music, strike visuals, and a bird friend.

Conclusion: There's so much good to be said about this game. I was sucked in immediately, and it doesn't feel like I actually spent 10 hours on my first play through.The graphics are quite aesthetically pleasing. (I could comment on the animation being a bit stiff and awkward at first... but I soon grew accustom to the style and stopped noticing.) The soundtrack is spot on! The story was excellent.

												Thank you dear god that this game has a sequel! I so fell in love with the characters and was pretty shaken to see how they were left at the ending (a very dramatic one, I must day), which in itself says a lot about this game: it makes you care. All in all, it's a beautiful game, with great story and lovable characters, if you're into adventure/quest games - buy it, don't think! Now, a more detailed opinion.It is very atmospheric due to the incredible hand-drawn backgrounds, some of which are beautiful, and some are moody or even downright scary, but never bland or boring. The characters were created with much love too, they really made me care, and even those characters who appear only for a short period of time are playing their part, be it for humor or to add some dramatic play. And they are, all of them, are not cardboard, they're interesting to see and I felt sorry that some died along the way. So I must say in all honesty that this game's story is better than a lot of books I've had to read. Though, the story felt unfinished regarding some arcs (like, we get to see the fairy land, but don't get to learn what happens to it afterwards), but there's a sequel that I haven't yet played as of writing this review, but I do hope it'll fix those unfinished points.As for the puzzle part, there were a few places that made me scratch my head, but 90% of the puzzles are pretty logical if you think in the terms of ""how can I use the surroundings"".The only thing that made me cringe (besides the ending), are some animation bugs. I played Mac version, dunno if it happen in the PC one, but running water in the first part of the game and some moving animations very kinda glitchy, when Geron walked it sometimes looked like he's lame on both legs. It did not affect gameplay in any way, just looked weird.			",169,140,1,61,36,0,15

												The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is one of the most interesting point n click games I've had the opportunity to play. Instead of adopting the humorous irreverence of many games in this genre, it opts for a far more fairy-tale/ storybook style that sits well in line with the Dark Eye setting.In terms of narrative the game offers its own unique perspective on the traditional story line of rescuing the princess/fairy. It's by no means original, but the game developers and writers have done a good job integrating a fairly staid and trope filled story whilst still retaining their own artistic integrity. The immersion within the Dark Eye Universe is deftly handled, a great deal of information is revealed throughout the story, at first leaving the viewer slightly overwhelmed with lists of names of background characters but by the end of the story, it seems most of the lore has been left out so that the richness of the setting is hardly scratched. The art direction is highly unique and is in fact Chains of Satinav greatest selling point. The backgrounds are simply exquisite, and the impressionistic rendering of the characters to suit their setting is simply unbelievable. The only issue is the animation, both the speaking and walking animations seem rather jerky and unnatural, probably as a result of the overdetailed character models. At first it is quite disconcerting to see the facial animations however as the game progresses the mind adapts to the irregularity and it becomes slightly less noticeable but still annoying.As for the gameplay itself, the puzzle elements are particularly well done. Whilst there are still puzzles that seem to obey their own logic rather than true logic, they were fairly far and few between, and on the whole the solutions made a great deal more sense than some of the random item combinations that point n click games are known for. Although this seems to make the game a lot less difficult it also removes a great deal of the annoying item combinations and time wasting staring at inventories and clicking items on items is thankfully removed. The inclusion of the break and mend mechanics added a layer of complexity to the mix but didn't overcomplicate issues. As for the environmental puzzles they range from being fairly generic to two puzzles that were highly appealing due to their unique nature as well as incredible integration into the mythos. It was refreshing to find puzzles that adapted themselves to not only the world itself but served simultaneously as expanding upon the mythology. As with most point n click games, once completed there isn't really much challenge which would entice a replay, however the charming fairy-tale like story could lead to a replayability factor in much the same way that we return to and revisit beloved children's stories.In short it's highly recommended on the basis of it's art, story and puzzles but due to the fact that it is simpler than other point n click games will make it seem a lot shorter on time value.

												No.  No no no no no.  This is a middling-sweet story locked away behind one of the worst, most counterintuitive point-and-click guess-what-the-developer-thought-was-obvious games ever.  I want my $0.99 back, it was such atrocious gameplay.Please, please do tell me why I want to pour wine on a magical prison instead of talking to the wise sage about magical prisons to see what he knows.  OBVIOUSLY, I want to pour wine on it.  And just as obviously, I'm going to use a necklace to fish with, when the game dangles a fishing pole in front of me as though it were an unsolved puzzle.  Protip: it's not; you never get the fishing pole; your companion fishes with the necklace but only if she's winched to the right height which is not actually above the hole she's supposed to fish through.  Did you know your fourth leaf is in the pig trough?  And that despite other collectors getting riddles hinting at the location of their leaves, you have no reason to suspect the pig trough because I DON'T KNOW WHY BECAUSE.  Because there's no riddles for you, buddy! At more than a dozen places, this game offers no feedback except the chance to pixel-hunt across (admittedly lovely) backdrops that scroll but only if you try to walk off the edge, which hides interaction points silently, and assuming you don't miss any of those points, you're still trying every item you've found on each one of them, hoping to randomly stumble across the one that shabby game designers welded awkwardly onto the flow of a barely-likeable story.Do Not Buy.

												Let me start off by saying that even though I enjoyed the game, it had some issues you would not expect a $20 point & click adventure game to have, which resulted in some annoying gameplay at times.Firstly, the gameplay. It's simple, and easy to find your way around, but it's laggy, and sometimes freezes alltogether. Now, I am aware that I do not have the best computer in the world, but it is more than capable of running this game, and meets the requirements. I have read somewhere that someone else have had the same problem, as their computer is capable of running it, but the game refuses to run smoothly, and that's something I had a problem with. But don't you dare turn those graphic settings lower to try and even out the lag, because it makes the game run worse. Turning it down from 64 bit to 32 bit seemed to cause it to crash and refuse to run. I turned it down to 32 while in the game, when I relaunched a while later it crashed upon reaching the main menu. I turned it back up to 64 through the launcher settings, and it worked. Thus, turning it down will make this worse for you. If your lucky enough to not experience this then feel free to ignore everything I just said above, but if you're looking to buy, just keep that in mind. The laggy gameplay is apparently on the developer's side, and not my computer's fault, or so I've heard. I felt like for the price they are asking, they could have done a bit more to ensure stable gameplay - without crashes.The storyline.. where to begin. Firstly, at the start of the game I found myself rather confused. It seemed every character is very cautious of the protagonist, but the game failed to explain why at the time. You will find out later in the game why the people think so, however at the start it was hard understanding why everyone hated the protagonist so much. I feel like the game has a large amount of lore which it didn't bother to explain, at all. I wish it did a bit more to explain the past of The Seer, and why he was executed over his predictions for Andergast. The storyline itself was good, being dark and sad at the same time. It had that uneasy and mysterious atmosphere to the most of it. It managed to interest me enough to play it till the end and see how it all wraps up, and I can honestly say I was disappointed with what I got at the end. The ending felt rushed, to say the least. I was expecting it to be the longest chapter in the game, where all the pieces would come together, everything would finally make sense, and I literally got the opposite, and find myself having to buy the sequel, Memoria, to find out how the story wraps up. That was one thing that irritated me a lot. I did not expect such an abrupt ending that would drive me to buy Memoria just to find out how it all fits together. For people familiar with this game genre, I'm sure the puzzles were not very challenging, or rather nothing they weren't already used to. For me though, a lot of these puzzles made no sense, at all. There were times where I was stuck and had no idea what to do, I actually used a guide through most of the gameplay due to this. I found it easier than to spend 4 hours trying to figure out how to move on to the next area, and I'm pretty sure I'll be doing the same with Memoria.One thing I really liked about this game is the art. The hand drawn backrounds are amazing, and beautiful. It fits perfectly with the game's atmosphere. Every scene has so much detail, and I love that. The music was pretty good, too. The art, and the music together really succeeded in giving it that fantasy-feeling. The cutscenes felt slow, and as if the characters were incapable of expressing any sign of emotion, whatsoever. They all look as if no fluffs were given, even with the impending doom, everyone seems so calm and chill and as if they literally do not care about what's going on. Their tones of voice, too, could have been a bit more realistic as if they were scared or alert about the situation. Geron literally witnesses someone die, like twice, and does not seem to care at all. After talking to Gwinnling's half-dead body, you can pick up a knife, and Geron's like, ""At least I will have a reminder of Gwinnling."" Are you kidding me? You just witnessed the guy who raised you die, and you find comfort in a broken knife? Even when Geron and Nuri kissed, (if you don't reject her) I saw no signs of emotion. The only time I really saw emotion was when Nuri cried at the end, and even that was unrealistic, as she keeps the same facial expression, except a tear starts running down her cheek. I think the guy yelling about his broken bottle of blue beard dye was more realistic than that. I feel like they could have put more effort in making it seem like the characters care and/or have emotions.The last thing that bothered me is the amount of times the protagonist says something so obvious, it made me want to cry. I'm sure it's normal for games of this genre to have the protagonist announce what you pick up, when you pick up an item, but I find it annoying and highly unnecessary. I know what it is.. I'm the one who told you to pick it up.. I saw the name of the item while hovering over it.. I do not need you to announce what it is once you pick it up. Not to mention the amount of times Geron will suddenly stand still to say ""Nuri!"" and then continue moving forward. Please.. why..And lastly, I will wrap it all up by saying it is an interesting game, with a good story, and through no point of this review was I trying to suggest that is it a bad game. I enjoyed myself a lot while playing it, despite the minor irritations. It has some issues that made me feel like the price is not worth it, at all. Yet again, every game has its flaws I suppose. I would not recommend getting this at full price, due to the reasons listed above. If you're a fan of this genre, and you can manage to look past its flaws, then give it a try! You might just like it. I recommend getting it on a discount, though. But I suppose opinions on the matter vary. Do note that I did not pay for this, I recieved it as a gift, but that does not change how I feel about the price. If they bothered to improve the weak points I mentioned, you might just get your money's worth if you did pay full price. And now I'm off to try Memoria. I strongly hope that they did not repeat the same mistakes in the sequel. I am expecting  the pieces to finally come together, and the story to be complete. I'm excited to see how it all ends, that is, if Memoria even is the end of it. It would be a huge let-down if they managed to neglect Memoria in the same aspects as Chains of Satinav. Phex be with me..			",89,29,0,25,5,0,10

												This game is a big disapointment. Ok, the settings are wonderful. Even better than wonderful actually. I can understand this is reason enough to play the game entirely. I should add that it got me very far.But apart from these drawings, there is nothing interesting in Chains of Satinav. It's a very basic point&click, with pixel hunting and puzzles created by people who smoke a bit too much. But the true shadow is the story and the characters. It looks like the game adaptation of The Black Cauldron.I couldn't finish the game. Not because of the difficulty (which isn't very high), but because it's boring. Very boring. I was just fed up with this main character and his dumb face. Fed up with his retard voice. Fed up with the useless girl, her irritating laughter, her profound stupidity and the fact that she's only here to sleep with the main character at the end (no matter how  many times he lied to her through the game). I felt insulted by the sheer stupidity oozing from this game and the fact that someone thought I might enjoy it. Ce jeu est une terrible déception. Oui, les décors sont beaux, ils sont même absolument somptueux et ça peut être considéré comme une raison suffisante pour jouer à Chains of Satinav. Malheureusement, c'est vraiment le seul intérêt. Après ça, on retrouve un point&click on ne peut plus insipide, avec du pixel hunting et des énigmes imaginées par des types qui avaient trop fumé. Enfin, ça, je m'y attendais. Par contre, le scénario est une♥♥♥♥♥♥♥absolue. On dirait l'adaptation de Taram et le Chaudron Magique en jeu d'aventure. Je n'ai pas réussi à finir le jeu. Pas parce qu'il était difficile (la difficulté est très correcte), mais parce qu'il est chiant. Genre vraiment. J'en avais marre de ce héros et de sa gueule de con, de sa voix d♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥fini et de l'autre♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥qui rigole tout le temps, enchaîne connerie sur connerie et ne sert qu'à se faire tirer à la fin. Je me suis senti humilié par tant de nullité. Encore un jeu pour mon dossier Bouses.			",73,40,2,24,5,0,13

												I usually enjoy Dedalic games, but this one was very frustrating to play. So much so that I didn't even finish it. Without giving away spoilers, in case this game works for someone else, I'll explain why I didn't.I missed one interaction right at the beginning of the game. Once I figured out what I'd missed, I went back to try to rectify that, but the cutscene I needed to happen wouldn't. So, I started a new game, thinking that I was happy I was only 10 minutes into the game.In the new game, much later in the gameplay, I needed a stone. I did what I needed to do to get it, but it never showed up in my inventory. However I kept getting the notice telling me I only required one stone and it wouldn't let me chip off another piece. So, I went back to a previous save and tried to collect the stone again. Not happening. Once again, there was no stone showing up in my inventory, but yet again I got the statement that I only needed one stone and it wouldn't let me chip away another piece. I even looked at a walk-though to make sure I did that correctly! That was enough buggy gameplay for me. Games are supposed to be fun, and I wasn't having any. Time for me to move on.

												I couldn't put this one down!! The story is fabulous, and the artwork is even better. This game is so pretty, I couldn't help but take pictures on a lot of the screens. The music and voice acting follow; they are both great. The game surprises you with some dark moments that you don't expect due to the cheeriness of some scenes in the beginning. Lately when I play point and clicks I find myself having to look up solutions to puzzles just because I can spend so long on one thing and start to think it's a bug or something. But I rarely had to look up solutions for this game - Only one or two that got me frustrated. I like to take my time so I'm sure this is excessive, but The Dark Eye kept me entertained for the whole 20 hours it took me to finish it :o Only real gripe is that I wish the ending was developed more, it felt abrupt and not as satisfying as I'd hoped.Edit: The ending is not a problem if you go right on to Memoria, the sequel, it picks right back up where you left off :)			",87,120,0,19,12,2,14

10/10 - This is just a beautiful game.I played Memoria first (not knowing it was Part 2 of this series) But I have to say I enjoyed this much more! The artwork is incredible, The different places you visit along your journey are magical, they really immerse you in the game. The gameplay is smooth, story is awesome, and the puzzles were creative and challenging. .  I played it with the combo hints on and that made it more enjoyable as you can just scrollwheel through the items to see what fits when you are stuck. A must have for any Point & Click Adventure Lover!			",24,18,0,2,0,0,0

												I wish there was an intermediary option between ""recommended"" and ""not recommended"", because I'd go for it in a heartbeat. As it is, I cannot say this game doesn't have any redeeming qualities, but it clearly have faults.Pros:- The art is well-done, so many scenes offer beautiful landscapes and vibrant streets, and more than once I just looked for hints without using the game's help because, well, I liked searching through such screens.- Difficulty in puzzles increases gradually. The first ones are fairly intuitive, especially once you get to think in terms of ""what can Geron break and how would repair it cause things to change"". Like breaking a shelf to make the items on it fall at his feet so that he can pick them up.Cons:- Choppy animations. Granted, I do play on a laptop; still, I wouldn't except loading times on it.- Uninspired English dubbing (can't tell about the other languages).- The main characters were fairly bland, and the chemistry between them didn't make as much sense as it was supposed to.- Some decisions/actions were really stupid. Like this character being told they mustn't touch a specific item because it would make the whole place collapse. Guess what the character does (for no reason whatsoever, not even accidentally brushing past the item while going somewhere else)? Yeah.- The story in itself is pretty cookie-cutter.Conclusion: ""Not recommended"" at its regular price, however if you can get it at a discount (like I did—it was 90% off), it makes for a nice little point-and-click game that shouldn't be too difficult.

												Interesting, from a story point of view. Buy it only on sale, I got mine with a Daedalic bundle. The first half of the game is super boring, but the game becomes very interesting once you get to the Blood Barriers near Orkland and the Black Furs. I would recommend trying it as a storyteller, rather than a game. PROS1. Interesting Fantasy WorldThe world is revealed to you very slowly. From human-sized fairies to blue beard dwarves to Black Fur Orcs to Imps and so on. I loved the imaginary creatures like the Oculonculus with his Oglescope, the Peaclock bird and the optical illusions with the flow of water.CONS1. Difficult to the point of Time WastingSome of the puzzles are really illogical, like solving the thieves' banter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The more than adequate sountrack also contributes to creating a unique feeling while you play that is not easy to get rid of even after finishing it. However, many of the puzzles the player is bound to find throughout the game are confusing at the very least, and the general quality of game design is not on par with the above-mentioned virtues.Still, I would recommend this to any lover of the genre. It may even become one of your favourite adventure games.			",202,111,2,37,29,3,34

												A beautiful adventure with good puzzles, pretty graphics and an interesting story. The characters are quite adorable, too. The story is open ended though, so if you want to know the real end you will have to play the sequel - Memoria - as well.			",38,46,0,37,15,0,21

												A great original take on the Point & Click fantasy adventure trope. The story is very solid and the worldbuilding is excellent. I was also pleasantly surprised by the length of the game.If you enjoy this genre of games, you can NOT afford to miss this beauty!			",104,67,3,23,14,1,30

												A click to play game which is told in artistic rendered backgrounds and black/beige colored painted video clips.This game has many interesting puzzles to solve and characters to discover. To find out about what you have to door how to progress you have to either talk to people or find and make use of the itms which are located nearby, some of them have to be fusioned together.This game has a beautiful and exciting story. I wont spoil about, you better discover it for yourself.That beeing said i still must note i got this game on a recent Steam sale for 0,99 Euros it was very cheap and of course i did not regret the buy.Generally i can recommend this game, especially when it is on sale. I cant say if the price matches the game, personally i would have not spent 20 € on it but i think its surely worth 10 €. What i miss in this game are better animations like when your characters walk or speak. Also some places for example close to rivers could show more motion like the waterflow or probably the wind blowing through grashalms would have justified the pricetag of 20€ way more.The replay value is none existant if it comes to gameplay but rather when you forgot about the story and want to discover it again in the future.The voiceovers of the game as well as the sounds are well done and contribute to the exciting story.Personaly i have fallen in love with the main characters Geran, Nuri and the Raven i think you will too.

												I greatly enjoyed, and felt a strong sense of intrigue and curiosity playing Chains of Satinav. Without prior knowledge of this German role-playing game's history, I found the Dark Eye universe fresh while including many beloved conventions of fantasy. From talking animals, to fairies, to sweeping and surreal landscapes, seedy port towns with pirate ships, and memorable characters with distinct personalities, I'd almost say this game comes recommended to any lover of Fantasy period. If you aren't already a fan of point-and-click/puzzle-solving games in general however, I'd say this game, though finely crafted, probably won't be changing your mind. In summary:Pros:+ Creative puzzle solving required to advance, aka makes you use your head+ Great voice acting which really brought characters to life+ Gorgeous art style! The painterly look was implemented beautifully, so kudos to the artist(s) involved with the design work :)+ Lovely soundtrack. Morose, ambient, and mysterious. Not a thing out of place+ Conclusion feels satisfying and is open-ended enough to lead smoothly into the sequel (""Memoria"")+ Geron as a protagonist felt well-realized and fleshed out. Repair/destruct mechanic was neat+ Limited dialogue choices implemented as a small reference to the game's RP'ing rootsNeutrals/Cons:- Although a certain character seriously annoyed me to begin with (manic pixie dream girl whom has trouble taking instructions), she did seem to develop as the story progressed, albeit in a...  not so positive way. The ending kind of sealed the deal for me admiring the direction the story decided to take, and the bittersweet tone felt nicely ""realistic""- Some jerky animation and performance issues depending on PC and lip syncing was sometimes off- A few puzzles I remember as requiring one to not only think outside the box, but obsessively scope out every vaguely pick-able object in the environment. You will no doubt be seeking some kind of help from a guide or hotspot indicator by the end of it (and if not, WOW)Overall:8.5 out of 10The Dark Eye: CoS is a unique game with a storyline which seeks to stand out, and for the most part I would say it has succeeded. If you're a fan of well-written fantasy stories (with that classic German spin on darker undertones), check out this game, and consider supporting Daedalic's work.			",13,57,0,14,1,0,3

												The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a nice point and click adventure game, and I'll recommend it to those that likes trying out games of this genre. The game's atmosphere is a mix between old fairy tales and more modern fantasy.The characters seem like they would generally be at home in one of the old tales, they are not too deep or complex. Especially the main character is very boring, and the villain seem to just be the antagonist because he are evil. Near the beginning of the story, it is explained briefly in a conversation why the main bad guy really got burned at the stake, but it is hardly touched upon. So for all intents and purposes it is just an evil magic ruler trying to cause harm and gain power. The game is set in third person, which I like.The love interest in the story is very naive and childish. Which fit with her character, but I disliked it a lot. She believes everything she is told, has such an open and innocent mind... Really a weird romance choice. Would fit better with the main character in a sort of purely friendly or maybe sibling sort of relationships.The game is set in a fantasy world, with orcs and dwarves being present. And you also get the feeling of another kingdom and politics, which doesn't influence the overall plot once it starts going, but serves to build the world.The story is your classic good versus evil battle, but it does mannage to put in a few twists here and there. At times the story is a bit too dramatic for a point and click adventure in my opinion. As someone is about to die, while you are puzzle solving... And you might, like me, miss an object, so it takes you a long time to figure out what to do. But generally the problems are not so immediate threats.As for the puzzles themselves. They were mostly fun. Many parts were also difficult for me. Trying to figure out what to do, but I felt there were a few too many times where I was required to go back and talk to an npc, that I had already chatted with. It would have been nice if the main character or anyone else could have given hints like ""Maybe I should go back and talk to X again."" or ""I need to find out how to get X working."" As there were quite a few times where I didn't know what problem I was trying to solve or where to go. But then again, it might just be that I was bad at the game. I get stuck in most puzzle games and have to look up a guide at least once. The game also has a destroy and a fix spell to help give some variety, and try to make you think about the puzzles in a different way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a tough one. I will recommend this under a few conditions. It's not a great game but if you love stories, as I do, it's worth experiencing. Probably a ""sale buy,"" which is what I did.Gameplay was ok. There were only a few puzzles I really enjoyed and only a few that really stumped me. Thankfully there were only a few times that I felt the eventual solution made no sense, but they are there.However, this is a story and character driven game. For most of the game, I didn't like Geron, the protagonist. He spends most of the game whining about how people treat him and he has bad luck, both due to a prophesy that he is a herald of doom. He finally meets someone who doesn't know about this prophesy and actually likes him, but he's a total jerk to her for a while. In contrast to the whiny Geron, you'll have sweet, naive Nuri. She is what drove the game for me, but I admit that's partially due to my natural protective instincts, so your mileage may vary.Later Geron does develop affection of at least a friendly sort for Nuri and does want to help her. However it still takes longer for him to get past his problems. When he FINALLY does, he FINALLY becomes a protagonist I could get behind. The end of the game is amazing, but I won't spoil it. As I said at the start, if you like stories, it's worth a discount buy to experience.So what about other aspects? First, you are treated to some fantastic main menu music. However you will then play a game with almost no music. Sometimes this makes sense, as sound might be important in a very few scenes, but mostly it just makes the game oddly quiet. This seems to be only so that the game can reward you with a small musical line when you solve a puzzle. I'd rather have more good music. On the topic of sound, most of the voice acting, including the main character, is terrible. There is one section, where he spins a tall tale, that sounds genuine, but in most conversations, it's very bad. There are a few exceptions, the most notable being the second main character, Nuri. She has a lovely voice and does a great job. It's one of the reasons I really like the character.Visually, the game is a mix and I never thought I'd see such extremes in one work. The background art and characters look great. However the animations are awful. This is particularly true with the characters' faces as they talk. It's a painted style, so they only have a few different frames they use.			",111,43,0,29,5,0,12

												First off, I want to call this game out on it's anti-corvid bias.But wow, I started out this game thinking it was a banal medieval adventure game, but it grew into something far greater. I loved the lore, the stunning artwork, and fell in love with Geron (though he constantly berated all the decisions I made for him, his voice is like chocolate.) After playing Rufus in four consecutive Deponia games, it was nice to have a sympathic protaganist. I also really liked Nuri and her voice, even though she basically could have been swapped out with a 6 year old. I liked the choice to make her look very human, and there were times when I questioned whether she really was a fairy.I played on hard mode and the puzzles started out deceptively easy. Then I found myself in a fantastic and terrifying realm where the rules didn't apply, and things quickly grew very difficult. The artwork in this realm was very evocative of Hieronymous Bosch, both beautiful and deeply disturbing.Also the Fairy Scholar is basically David Bowie, so yeah, get this game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Of the Daedalic games I have played so far, this one has been the best. I really like the characters, the world and the story. With Deponia, Rufus was such a jerk and unlikable wheras Geron was so much better. The art design was really neat even though I wish the lip speach had more work. Probably my favorite part was the fact that I could play most of this game without a walkthrough. Which means I've either gotten better from playing the other Daedalic games or this one was easier. Either way, I really enjoyed it. Obviously I wish it was longer but it has a sequal which I will play next. RIght now, I'd say this series is far superior to the Deponia trilogy. I never thought point and click adventure games would be fun for me. Daedalic, proved me wrong. So glad I bought the pack.			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												Since I wasn't familiar with the Dark Eye universe, Chainse of Satinav looked like a simple adventure in a bland fantasy universe, but luckily it turned out to be much more. Even though the story is not the most original and shocking tale i've ever experienced, it was interesting enough to keep me going the whole time. The characters are interesting and very well written, the backgrounds are gorgeous (just look at some of the screenshot I took!), and the puzzles are not half bad (maybe a tad bit too easy, although at least there are some twists to the original formula especially in one particular place within the game). For these reasons I'd recommend the game even though it's not perfect. For me the voice acting wast the biggest annoyance, most of the side characters are passable, but the protagonist (Geron) speaks sooo softly in every situation, it's really off-putting. The other thing is the character-animation, sadly it's really choppy and the lip-sync is often way off. This could be bothersome for some people, I got used to it after an hour or so. These are just minor technicalities though and shouldn't keep fans of the genre from giving this a shot.			",908,350,40,102,62,9,78

7/10 - Plenty of good hereThis point-and-click takes a reluctant and not very capable hero on an adventure through creatures, fairies, witches, and beyond.  While the same ""does this fit with this"" business exists as does in nearly every game in this genre, Chains of Satinav manages to make them not seem as obvious.  There are some puzzles that seem arbitrary in their solutions, but one puzzle (peacock, for those who have done it) was pretty magnificent.  Lastly, I really liked Nuri the fairy.The achievements are not impressive.  Anything not story-related involves doing some redundant action xx redundant times.  It also has two different complete playthrough achievements based on difficulty, which is something I don't understand for this type of game.  Once the puzzles and mysteries are solved this makes the second playthrough purely tedious.			",267,154,8,53,29,3,22

The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav - An unpolished gem that ought to suit most adventure enthusiastsI am definitely a sucker for old-school point-and-click adventures. You know that kind of person who played through most of Lucas Arts and Sierra games during the early 1990’s and still thinks that LOOM was a great game and who, when someone says pirate, spontaneously starts humming the LeChuck theme? Yep, that's me.Before we begin, it should also be noted that I have never played the pen-and-paper version of The Dark Eye. Save for my encounter with The Blackguards (another game by Daedalic) I have had no prior experience of the rich lore of The Dark Eye universe.This review is based on my three playthroughs of The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav (one regular + two achievement runs). Let us begin with the good stuff…The graphics +++++…are absolutely stunning, with a high sense of details put into the making of every 2D background. Nowadays you can expect to find this level of quality in many games, but in my opinion, 2D art truly comes to show in point-and-click adventure games, whereas it tends to be overlooked in other genres. In TDE:CoS the scenery seamlessly intertwines with the storyline. You can see that the sketch artists allowed themselves to be touched by the story... and possibly a wee a bit of fairy magic was involved as well.The music ++++ …is also great, in all its simplicity. The tunes blend into the background so that you never take your mind off the storytelling. Instead of using their whole arsenal, the team who made the music carefully chose instruments that would mix well with both the story and the elfish concept art used in this game.Voice acting ++(+)Most of the voice actors did a decent job. Overall it’s not that great, but good enough to do the game justice. Most adventure games let you down when it comes to the speech. Perhaps I'm too old-fashioned, but voice acting kind of kills the spirit, doesn't it? It almost always ruins the imagination for me. How does a beautiful fairy sound like? Or a talking crow? A brutish orc? Perhaps you have a tingling sensation of the sound in your mind, but forget about trying to mimic that sound with your own voice. The task of giving voices to magical creatures is a task best left for professionals and in TDE:CoS some actors were obviously more professional than others. Several characters does not sound anywhere near authentic (putting aside my subjective opinion of the matter, they simply sound way too scripted, which I believe most players would agree with). Then there are others with great voices. Towards the middle of the game, you’ve gotten used to it. The female voice actors did an overall much better job than their male counterparts in this game. Or perhaps the dialogue was better suited for female voices, having been written and scripted by a woman?As a side note: have you ever played the game called ""Simon the Sorcerer[www.gog.com]""? If not, I feel for you. It was a lovely little gem of its time and as every other game from the early PC/Amiga gaming industry it was (initially) released without voice effects. Save for a few sound effects and background music, you never knew how Simon, the mages, trolls or any other of the absolutely hilarious beings in that game sounded like. And that was... g r e a t. Later on, they dubbed it (of course). Which version do you think received the highest scores? And I guess that’s my point; players have learned to expect mesmerizing graphics and all characters to have high-quality voices, no matter what. Some games try to come up with nifty workarounds (Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons comes to mind) but most such attempts fail. As a developer, you might not dare to let your product come off as a low-budget/indie game at first glance. But most of the times, less is indeed more.The storyline ++++…actually works! I didn't quite know what to expect when I started playing this game. I had not read any reviews prior to playing it but I have (sadly) learned the hard way to lower my expectations whenever I tryout modern fantasy adventures. But TDE:CoS felt more like a child's story, having been tucked away inside the writer's mind for many years before being put to the pen and shared with the rest of the world. With a box office budget, I'm sure that this game could have been turned into a decent movie script. As such, the limitations of a point-and-click adventure sometimes makes the story come off a bit crude and rough around the edges. But it's nothing that you can't polish up a bit with your own imagination (if you allow yourself to focus on the good stuff and ignore the rest).My consensus after playing the game from start to end three times in just a few days is that the story is probably a lot larger than what could be depicted from this rather small game. As a player, I strolled along through the chapters but ended up craving more after each intermission (which is a good sign, right?) instead of the short cut scenes. Same goes, without a doubt, for the ending.Perhaps the cut-scenes could have been more ""layered"" (in lack of a better word for it) to give them a bit more depth. Or perhaps the game could be filled with more dialogues, background stories and side-quest-lore that players could explore at their own leisure?So, let’s knock off the most negative aspects of the game while we’re at it… The coding/scriptingThe single worst part of this game is irritably the part that should have been the easiest to get right: the coding and scripting of actions in the game. Although TDE:CoS should be more than able to run smoothly on almost any computer you could find today, it often slows down and feels sluggish between important actions and in scenes where the main character has to move from one side of the screen to the other. Why on earth did Daedalic not make this better? It saddens me to see such a seemingly easy task being carelessly ignored, especially when you consider the astonishing work made by the other members of the developing team.The animationsWhoever cleared these animations should have their eyesight checked out immediately. Save from a few exceptions, I have not seen animated 2D stills of such poor quality since... gee, we’re talking pixelated 1990’s here. Forget all about expecting smooth 12 fps stuff. Honestly, people of Daedalic, I implore you to search for better animators for future titles. And to forego any quirky remarks; no, I haven't played the sequel (Memoria) yet and no, I have no idea if the animations improved later on in the game series. But I surely hope so. The story and its characters deserve it.Had it not been for the lush scenery and music that straight off the bat inspired me to delve deeper into the game, I might actually have stopped playing TDE:CoS after just a few minutes due to the poor animations - that’s how bad they are. But to everyone who has not yet bought the game: ignore all comments about the animations. Yes, sure, they suck. Yes, they will tick you off at first glance. But after a while you simply ignore them, because the rest of the game more than makes up for it. And they improve after a few chapters.Overall conclusionI think this game is a pearl. At the end I wanted to keep the characters with me in that same longing feeling you get after finishing a good book (or trilogy, as everything seems to be these days). Sure, some of the edges are a bit rough, but who cares when you end up falling in love with this dreamlike adventure after just a few paces into the game?Afterall, isn't that what adventures are supposed to be like?

												Great point and click adventure game. Puzzles are logical to solve, no crazy solutions like the puzzles in Deponia. During the course of the game you get the ability to break or fix certain objects. This ability gives a new dimension to puzzle solving.Story is decent. Artwork is amazing and each area you visit has lots of details.			",251,72,0,49,29,1,63

But TDE:CoS felt more like a child's story, having been tucked away inside the writer's mind for many years before being put to the pen and shared with the rest of the world. With a box office budget, I'm sure that this game could have been turned into a decent movie script. As such, the limitations of a point-and-click adventure sometimes makes the story come off a bit crude and rough around the edges. But it's nothing that you can't polish up a bit with your own imagination (if you allow yourself to focus on the good stuff and ignore the rest).My consensus after playing the game from start to end three times in just a few days is that the story is probably a lot larger than what could be depicted from this rather small game. As a player, I strolled along through the chapters but ended up craving more after each intermission (which is a good sign, right?) instead of the short cut scenes. Same goes, without a doubt, for the ending.Perhaps the cut-scenes could have been more ""layered"" (in lack of a better word for it) to give them a bit more depth. Or perhaps the game could be filled with more dialogues, background stories and side-quest-lore that players could explore at their own leisure?So, let’s knock off the most negative aspects of the game while we’re at it… The coding/scriptingThe single worst part of this game is irritably the part that should have been the easiest to get right: the coding and scripting of actions in the game. Although TDE:CoS should be more than able to run smoothly on almost any computer you could find today, it often slows down and feels sluggish between important actions and in scenes where the main character has to move from one side of the screen to the other. Why on earth did Daedalic not make this better? It saddens me to see such a seemingly easy task being carelessly ignored, especially when you consider the astonishing work made by the other members of the developing team.The animationsWhoever cleared these animations should have their eyesight checked out immediately. Save from a few exceptions, I have not seen animated 2D stills of such poor quality since... gee, we’re talking pixelated 1990’s here. Forget all about expecting smooth 12 fps stuff. Honestly, people of Daedalic, I implore you to search for better animators for future titles. And to forego any quirky remarks; no, I haven't played the sequel (Memoria) yet and no, I have no idea if the animations improved later on in the game series. But I surely hope so. The story and its characters deserve it.Had it not been for the lush scenery and music that straight off the bat inspired me to delve deeper into the game, I might actually have stopped playing TDE:CoS after just a few minutes due to the poor animations - that’s how bad they are. But to everyone who has not yet bought the game: ignore all comments about the animations. Yes, sure, they suck. Yes, they will tick you off at first glance. But after a while you simply ignore them, because the rest of the game more than makes up for it. And they improve after a few chapters.Overall conclusionI think this game is a pearl. At the end I wanted to keep the characters with me in that same longing feeling you get after finishing a good book (or trilogy, as everything seems to be these days). Sure, some of the edges are a bit rough, but who cares when you end up falling in love with this dreamlike adventure after just a few paces into the game?Afterall, isn't that what adventures are supposed to be like?

												It was a bit slow in the beginning but later on the story reveals itself in very interesting way so that I couldn't leave the game until I finished it. At some point I felt like I am playing Sanitarium with more exploitation of surreality and less depression (but still deppressive enough). There were couple of instances where I needed to look at walkthrough. But they were generally well-hidden objects and I was playing in the hard mode. Definitely recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like to think of myself as a patient person, but I do not have the patience for point-and-click games.  Usually, I find the story is slow and boring, and the puzzles are just BS ""click everything until something works"".I was really surprised and satisfied by ""Chains of Satinav"".  The story is intimate and well-told.  The characters are charming, lovable, and easy to root for.  The puzzles are overwhelmingly logical and straight-forward - solutions present themselves if you explore your surroundings, and item combinations are sensical and believable. To top it all off, the art style is just beautiful.I finished this game and immedately started a new playthrough.  This just has......well a certain humility about it. I'm struggling to find the right words, but it's a simple story told with a lot of charm, and I can't help but love it.--------------------------------------------------ADDON:  A lot of people remark that this game has technical issues, and that's true.  It's poorly optimized, and I saw frame rate drops, stuttering, and choppy animations while I was playing it.  For me, I was enjoying myself enough that I could overlook these issues, but it's understandable if other people find it bothersome.			",126,33,2,15,11,0,25

												Sadly I had to refund the game after playing it for about 20 to 25 minutes. First of all, on some machines, it stutters a lot, and my machine can handle Witcher 3 without any problems - though some fiddling fixed it.The voice acting is alright, the drawings of the background and characters are beautiful and the story seems promising. But what really got to me is the absolutely horrible animation of every activity every character does, be it walking, speaking or just idling - it is downright creepy at times, but mostly just bad. Also the main character is actually (poorly) 3D-rendered when you walk around with him, but drawn in cutscenes, leading to very weird and, again, creepy ""uncanny valley"" moments. I did not see much of the story, admittedly, but I just couldn't drag myself through the animations. Still, give it a try once it's on sale.			",226,58,13,37,7,0,18

												I really enjoyed this point and click adventure game. While it sometimes ran a little sluggish on my Macbook pro, it still went okay. Some of the levels were a little confusing, mainly the one away from the normal world, but I got through them eventually with the occasional outside help.For the storyline, I wasn't expecting the ride I was going to take, and there were some tough decisions to be made against what I normally would have personally done (telling lies, mainly) but it furthered the story.One things stuck in my mind the entire game was ""What was wrong with Hilda? She seemed lovely and obviously liked him. Why did he have to run off after some Fairy who I just wanted to strangle half the time.Overall, a lovely story with a real note of darkness.8/10			",63,37,0,16,12,0,40

												Chains of Satinav is a delight for the eye. The colorful and imaginative canvas that decorates every background of every scene, will take you back to your childhood and all the beautiful fairy tale stories you can remember.You play as Geron. A poor bird catcher intended for the common folks, but destined for something more. A dark curse will sweep the lands and take you far away from your home town Andergast and onto a fabled journey. You will venture through lush forests, mountain ranges, orc infested lands, smuggler dens, monstrous caves and even beyond your own world.The puzzles are very logical and not too harsh, a funny note: there is one part of the game that is set in a very abstract environment and there the puzzles are too, abstract and bizarre. In the beginning of your journey, you might find that some of the animations are a bit delayed, and that the voice acting is not the best you’ve heard. But if you give it time, the beautiful art and the well written story will speak plenty. ",220,99,3,41,27,2,54

												I had a hard time getting into the game due it's presentation. The art style and the protagonist were scratching some corny edges, and the whole game seemed to take itself too seriously. But after I gave the story and its presentation time to evolve I was intrigued nevertheless. Even the ending is well done and left some remaining impression on me.Most of the puzzles are doable, but sometimes a bit to obscure for my taste. Additionally to that, I've stumbled over a handfull of immersion-breaking bugs. But if you like adventure games and well-told stories, you should definitly try out this one!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chains of Satinav is a point-and-click adventure developed by the German Daedalic Entertainment and based on The Dark Eye RPG world, also German in origin. Both Daedalic and The Dark Eye have had difficulties with gaining currency in the English-speaking world, but based on this adventure (my first contact with Daedalic) the fault may lie in the Anglo-American cultural attitudes, for Chains of Satinav was absorbing and challenging in equal measure.Unlike in so many adventures, the lead is not a wisecracker but rather a serious young man hexed with bad luck and shunned by society because of this. Yet the game feels more like a Grimm story than a typical fantasyland, either in high or low mode. Since ""gritty, mature fantasy worlds"" usually mean dwarves with liver cirrhosis and bisexual elven terrorists I am happy with this design choice. There is a general feel of sadness everywhere and the themes deal with innocence and corruption. The graphics fit the above naturally and the hand-crafted scenery are lush yet clear. Colors are never garish nor murky and the visual presentation is an exact fit to my personal tastes. Animations are slighly limited, true, but that did not lessen my gaming pleasure. All sounds good too, especially the melancholy soundtrack which avoided the fake epic stylings so prevalent in many other titles. Settings are varied as well, from a crime-rotten port town to another plane where normal logics are superseded by fairytale equivelants.Puzzles are typically logical and the solutions are within reason but occasionally the clues are rather obscure and this can lead into confusion, especially in the fairy worls already mentioned. There are limited help options of which I used the hotspot highlighter, meaning that a button push shows all the interactive parts of the screen. Dialogue is more clear than flowery or punning and despite being based on a pre-existing RPG world there were, incredibly, no lore dumps anywhere. Since the story sees a downbeat young man protecting an innocent young woman I am unsure how the feminists would see that aspect but I did not see misogyny anywhere, nor other prejudices. As a whole this 10-hour game was a positive first taste of the Daedalic adventures and I will most certainly play the other ones as well. Definitely recommended for adventure fans.

												What can I say about this game...Well, firstly let’s start with the most obvious IT'S BLOODY GORGIOUS!! This game has some of the best ""hand drawn"" art work going.  Secondly, the story...as with a lot of point'n'click adventure games, it has a very tongue in cheek clichéd approach to its story but my word it pulls it off very well.  It has been many a year that I have actually sat at work, watching the second’s tick away waiting to get home just to play more of a game.  Thirdly, some of the puzzles are actual brain ticklers.  I have played a lot of these adventure games over the years and for a while now, it was almost like I was just going through the motions...you know ""I have a fish, I have some water, I have some beans...I bet I need to cook something with these...oh look there is a pot over there...let’s put these in and cook something"". Yes this game does have some very basic puzzles but as mentioned before, it also has some right pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ones that actually make you sit back and have to think ""hang on...how the f**k am I supposed to do this...""*Cons*There are a few glitches here and there. Some of the voice acting is a bit hit and miss. Also a lot of the NPC's are quite forgettable (not all though)Final Thoughts:If you like Point'n'Click adventure games, then add this one to your library ASAP! Also add memoria (the sequel to this one)8/10			",277,86,3,41,15,0,29

												I bought this game only because I was more interested in the game Memoria, which this is apparently a prequel to. Without yet having played Memoria, however, this was an interesting adventure game. There are a few puzzles that were difficult to solve, only because a few of the controls weren't obvious to me and I was missing some key bits of information, leading to a lot of combining every item in my inventory with every other item of my inventory. The story is interesting enough to keep you going, and it well explains the strange title. (It really should be called Geron's Quest or something more generic than this title so deeply steeped in the lore of the game. It's a little too full of itself at times in the attempt to be an epic adventure story). The voice acting isn't bad, and the puzzles were decent. You won't be stunned by this game, but it's entertaining enough. Buy it on sale and you probably won't regret it.			",45,70,0,5,2,1,6

												This has definitely become my favorite adventure game (thus far). The story was dark, but not enough to make someone depressed or anything. The art was well-done. The music was good. The puzzles were challenging (particularly in the fairy world). The main character was likeable enough and fairly developed well. Spoiler: I'm also glad that it didn't end on a cliché in which the main character ended up with the leading female character in some happily ever after-like setting.Complaints regarding story: They could've developed Nuri (the leading female character) a bit more. Spoiler: I get that the queen of the fairy world was tricked by the Seer, but I didn't really get why she was so crazy. Her sister didn't seem that way.  Another spoiler: It's possible I might've missed this, but I also don't understand how Nuri was able to leave her world. I get that she left because her mom went crazy and started making the world dark, but with all those rules, I wonder how she got away. I also wonder why the queen never mentions her missing daughter, unless that's part of how she's crazy.Technical complaints: There were some slight glitches here and there with the graphics being too big (out of proportion to the scene), but nothing that a re-load couldn't fix. There was also this part in which I couldn't get another story option to appear until I went through a character's dialogue twice. Despite the flaws though, I really enjoyed this game. It kept me interested throughout the whole story, which is important for a game full of puzzles, because they can get a bit tedious and if I don't have enough interest in the story, I might just give up on it. Definitely get it if you enjoy adventure, point-and-click games, rich story, and puzzles.			",14,107,0,51,16,0,8

												Worth playing for the art alone. The experience is definitely worth 5 dollars, and if you're intrigued by what you see, I'd say that it has enough content for the current retail price of $19.99.The gameplay is good and the special ability to break and repair objects is a fun gimmick, although I wish it was more universally available. The story is generic, and if you've played Deponia, you'll notice a lot of recurring concepts, but the characters are mostly likable. My biggest criticism of the game is that it presents the illusion of choice through dialogue options, but railroads you into a single plot thread (Deponia is also guilty of this).If you're on the fence about whether or not to get this, I'd recommend doing it. It's no masterpiece, but I don't see why anyone wouldn't enjoy it for what it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superb adventure game in term of atmosphereIn my 40s, I have played tons of adventure games and though some have deeper puzzle , some more humour , better graphics, I usually measure a game by the sum of its qualities and this one has lots of charms.My 16y daugther likes it too and she does not really play games usually so that was fun to play a game we both liked.What I like in the game are the humour, cute graphics, old point and click interface, the somewhat unusual story telling that keeps you want to move on, the character development in the story.However the puzzle are very basic and far between and sometimes the point and click get tedious and you can't help but look for the walkthrough when you get stuck ( used it less than 3 times so far though)Recommend for any adventure game fan			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was a bit hard to get through. I think that was mostly because I’m not used to point and click games. I found the puzzles to be very difficult and sometimes the story was slow. The main character grew on me although for most of the game I wanted to punch them both.Overall, the game was very decent. The art was lovely and the story line was inventive. I would buy and play again given the choice.			",332,205,3,83,49,0,48

												Like the other games of daedalic i've played 'til now, chains of satinav matches perfectly in the row of beautiful drawn point and click adventures with an good told story. It's another game in which they manage to let you taste the sweet flavour of the old golden adventures like 'The Legend of Kyrendia', 'Sam'n'Max Hit the Road',  'Simon, the sorcerer', 'Day of the tentacle' or the 'Indiana Jones' games. Perhaps daedalic will be the ""new Lucas Arts"" for the presence.			",187,96,6,21,16,2,16

												Out of all the Daedalic games, I would say art-wise this game is the most beautiful. Detailed portraits and backgrounds. The story is standard fantasy, with a little Alice in Wonderland influence towards the end maybe? Although at times the game gives optional dialogue choices, its still very linear since it doesn't really affect the story. Animations leave a little to be desired but the art more than makes up for it. The character are a little stiff but have great voice acting. The music is very reserved and no tracks really stand out but it fits the story's atmosphere. Enjoyed it very much.			",357,94,8,70,30,2,86

I liked the soundtrack - it's simple, fitting and rather elegant. Voice acting is good IMO - it sounds quite British which I like, and while we're at it I liked Nuri's English voice much much much better than German.P.S. Fairy scholar Jacomo Nauta resembles David Bowie a lot (""a memorable guy with two different-coloured eyes ... He should be here"").P.P.S.

												This game has the ability to draw you in right away. Some of the biggest appeals are the story, beautifully fleshed-out backdrop, and the ""close-to-home"" fantasy lore that gives its fans exactly what they want in a game of its genre. The one thing that stands out as a possible set-back for some, perhaps is the cryptic and seemingly random nature of a handful of the puzzles throughout the game. Some puzzles seem obvious right away, others not so much. This game had me close out multiple times to eyeball a walkthrough to figure out what I was doing. I believe a good point-and-click can at least provide some clues that may be subtle and not deduct from the gameplay. I felt that this game was lacking that sort of ""user friendliness"" in some moments, especially when you are given items in your inventory that are used in highly unconventional ways. Maybe this is part of what makes this game interesting--testing out possible uses for an item with the interface or with other items...but where does it flip to tedium for the gamer?The plot and art style of the game is what kept me hooked, there's a nice balance between clicking around just to explore an area and clicking around for items and descriptions of things to be used later. I recommend this game for its engrossing easy, and fair amount of dialogue that doesn't wear you down. For those who get easily frustrated toying with different objects in order to advance to the next screen, this game probably isn't for you. Fantasy RPG fans, this one's for you.			",33,10,0,11,0,0,1

												I had been hearing lots of great things about this game, so I grabbed it along with the sequel during the Steam Winter Holiday Sale. I haven't played any point-and-click puzzle/adventure games in a long time, but I am VERY impressed with this one. The sound track is great, the artwork is GORGEOUS, & I really loved the characters and story. I played on easy mode, but even so I found the puzzles very challenging & difficult (maybe I'm just dumb though?), & it was very fun & frustrating to try to figure them out. The solutions are practical yet not obvious at all, which makes solving them deliciously satisfying. The story ended in a way I did not expect at all, but that I loved. REALLY glad I decided to pick up the sequel at the same time I bought Chains of Satinav however, because the ending leaves you at a cliff hanger (in my opinion). I can't wait to check out Memoria & the other games set in this fantasy world.I've noticed that some other reviewers are giving this game a hard time over the voice acting, but I personally found the voice work very enjoyable. Absolutely recommended if you like challenging puzzles, lovely music and artwork, and an engaging story with entertaining characters.			",54,25,0,32,2,0,7

												It was a refreshing point and click game that was far more fascinating than Syberia series I played before. It had beautiful graphics, voiced acting, and great story. The fact I played Drakensang Dark Eye before added a bit of knowledge about the world. The game was not too long which is good but it told its story well. At the end I felt bad for Nuri.Pros- Great story- Beautiful scenery- Nuri- Voice acting- HintsCons- Animations could be betterOverall looking that it is a point and click game I did not expect great graphics similar to adventure detective games like Noire, but I was quite taken by the graphical beauty of this game. Gameplay was refreshing although some moments could make you stuck for a while figuring out the puzzle.Final verdict is solid 7/10 - Its worth playing for the story and beauty of the world.

												This is a lovely fairy tale about the wonders of imagination and the struggle of an outcast young man to make his own destiny in a world convinced that he's a bearer of bad luck.  It started out a little slow, but eventually I couldn't help but feel whisked away into this fascinating world with intricate and imaginative main characters, fairies, magic, and otherworldly creatures.I have a love/hate relationship with point & click games.  I really enjoy the stories and the artistic style of the games, but I'm also really really bad at them!  This game was no different.  It was a great story with loads of pretty backgrounds along the way, but I definitely wouldn't have been able to get through this game without my handy walkthrough.  Maybe it was just me, but some of the puzzles just seemed to defy logic.  It was almost like the devs knew it too because the main character made me laugh more than a few times with snarky comments about my terrible ideas!  Still, the challenge made me feel even better when I could actually solve some of the puzzles on my own.  When I couldn't, I just fell back on my walkthrough, so I could progress on the story.If you like fairy tales and point and click games, I definitely recommend checking out this game.  I feel like everyone should experience this story at least once.  It also goes on sale a lot, so make sure to keep an eye out for good deals.			",85,60,0,23,12,1,13

The length of the game is okay, around 12 hours to complete, the puzzles start gaining difficulty as you progress through the game which means you can beat the game without the need to look for a guide.

												Not a bad game but I can't recommend it at full price. I got it with a bundle, and I'd recommend that, or if it's really cheap on sale and you really want a point-and-click adventure game. But if you just really like the art style and have some money to burn, you could do worse.To summarize:Pros: - Decent story, not the most original but whatever - Hand drawn graphics are cool for the most part - First half of the game, all the puzzles make sense with a bit of thought Cons: - The animation is...sketchy. I've seen other indie hand-drawn games that are a lot more fluid - Some of the puzzles in the second half have kind of random/stupid solutions - Characters that left me with kind of a ""meh"" feeling (Nuri mostly annoys me) - Basically functional, but not very polished by any meansIf you want more detail:I ran into one area where doing things out of order actually prevented me from progressing because one of the items I needed was ""used"" and disappeared (it didn't need to) and I needed to repeat the sequence to do it right. Thankfully I had a save that wasn't too far back. Oh and there is an autosave...so there's that.Characters popped in and out during parts of the game (could be system dependent though).Once the game actually flipped into the original German when I was examining an object, both German voice actor and text. Guess they missed that one.At least one solution that I absolutely needed to look up, and still have no idea how I was supposed to figure it out without stumbling on the right combination of things that seemed unrelated.As I actually write it out some of these things seem nit-picky, but they kind of illustrate the general feeling of quality of the game. None of these things really kill the game, and I've definitely played worse, but unless you're running out of adventure games or this is on really good sale I'd say find something else. I'm not really surprised by the positive feedback on this game though. It wouldn't have taken a whole lot to change this to a lukewarm positive review, but it's really just below the point where I'd recommend it. ",43,40,1,7,17,0,5

												I got this as part of the Daedalic Armageddon bundle, and played it after playing the Deponia trilogy (which I loved) - and it does not disappoint. It's a sweet little game, with a compelling story and likeable characters. Like the other Daedalic games that I've played so far, it took me about 10 hours to complete, which is quite a nice length for a game of this type. It's unique selling point, and one of the reasons that I enjoyed playing it so much, is that you have magic powers. The main character only has one power - to break things, such as glass. Later, you are also able to fix things. It is this constant mechanic that makes this game so interesting. It makes you think around a problem very differently - for example, you may need to break something in your inventory, then use it, and then fix it again to solve a puzzle. This, and other constant useful items such as the knife and the flint and steel, makes this game more of a proper adventure. I, with my trusty knife and my magical skills, can do anything. Well, almost anything. Some things. The game does, however, have it's flaws. Some of the puzzles are, in my opinion, a little bit too obscure for their own good. This is mostly down to this game's tendency to give you too many items at once (that, and an inventory system which is quite difficult to navigate, rather than in Deponia, where it is possible to see all of your items at once). Too many things at once does make it a bit difficult to work out what you're supposed to use, and even if it doesn't, the solutions are not always the easiest to work out. I made it through most of the game without help, most of the puzzles were challenging, not impossible, but sometimes you just don't know what they're getting at, and still don't understand it after you've googled the solution. I don't know, I may just suck at point and click games. This is by no means a reason not to play it.The achievement system is weird. You make certain choices throughout the game, which don't affect the story much but do get you certain achievements (if you're bothered about that). The problem is, it's not just that you MISS achievements (there're some which it might not occur to you to try to get), you CAN'T get all of them in one playthrough. The achievement system contains alternative achievements, for each and every way of doing something. This is a little odd, but it isn't really important.The main disappointment for me was the ending. There was nothing wrong with it, in itself - but it was abrupt. I had the same problem with Deponia (although the ending there was slightly less fulfilling). You complete the game, and then... it's just over. A little bit of a trailoff, but it doesn't hang around to say goodbye. There IS a second game to play - but, unlike Deponia, it isn't just a continuation of the same story. This story ended, and I felt a little cheated of closure at the end. Not much - and maybe it's because I was just sad to finish playing it - but there were a couple of loose ends, to say the least. No matter, I'm greatly looking forward to the next game. Hopefully it will fill in some of the gaps. The Daedalic bundle is a great buy on sale (mostly just for Deponia and this, and maybe another game or two), I'm very quickly becoming a big fan of this company.			",77,33,2,10,4,2,2

												Just wonderful.  The most enjoyment I've had in an inventory-based adventure game in years.  The game is beautiful.  The story charming and sad.  The dialogue well translated.  The puzzles are mostly forgettable, except maybe the set in fairyland, but I'm okay with that, because it's more about telling a story this time, and all of the puzzle fit into that story.  There's no rubber ducky to get the sewer key from the railroad tracks in this thing.One review complains about pixel hunting....  You can turn on hot spots in the options.  And generally I wouldn't recommend against this, but I wouldn't do it until you are done with the oak leaf challenge at the beginning or you might give away one of the riddles.

												Normally a fan of Daedalic's games eg. I really enjoyed the Deponia series. However, I'm saddened to say that I was pretty disappointed by this game. It's boring.It's not a bad game, but it's also not a great game. The main character is arguably the most boring character I have ever come across in any P&C adventure game. The storyline isn't very engaging either. This the major let down. As a result, you don't exactly feel like you're being rewarded when you figure out a puzzle. The artwork gives it a point of difference, but for me personally, it's not really that much of a deciding factor.If you're curious, purchase it when it is on special. But in comparison to Daedelic's other games, it falls short.			",3,17,0,1,3,0,0

												A gorgeous, genuinely-touching point-and-click adventure game which came right out of left field.Daedalic Entertainment has a nasty habit of creating very pretty adventure games with miserable, contemptible protagonists who never change, never grow and never learn; the plots, the art & the gameplay are all wonderful but are generally wasted because the hateful, unchanging protagonist taints the whole experience. The ""Deponia"" series, for instance, is ruined by the protagonist's rampant racism and misogyny; ""The Whispered World"" is ruined by the protagonist's relentless moping and whining; and ""A New Beginning"" is ruined by the unbearably morose protagonists and hysterically alarmist agenda. This game, however? It's like it was published by someone else entirely. The protagonists are delightful and the message is remarkably heartfelt. There are times when Geron & Nuri can be irritating, but those moments make sense in context and help express the difficulty the characters have adapting to the trials and tribulations which beset them. And that might be the most important thing about this game -- the characters ADAPT. They change. They grow and learn from their experiences. I haven't played a point-and-click adventure game this good since the last ""Monkey Island"" game! If this were a comedy (which it very much isn't), it might even give that series a run for its money!The art is beautiful, the narrative is simple but engaging, the voice-acting is splendid, the characters are likeable, and the gameplay is perfect. This may be the finest game Daedalic Entertainment has ever put out, and I can't wait to play the sequel!			",108,135,0,48,13,1,16

												The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is an epic tale about a young man by the name of Geron. Geron, having lost both of his parents, was raised by Gwinnling the bird catcher. During his youth, he witnessed the death of an evil seer. As the evil seer was being put to the stake, he foretold that the young Geron would bring doom upon the town of Andergast. This prophecy fuelled the superstitious nature of the townsfolk and caused him much grief as he grew up with. In order to prove the seer and everyone else wrong, Geron decided to take part in a competition, in which the victor would be honoured by the King. As Geron sets his eye on the prize, his adoptive father, Gwinnling, seems to have more pressing concerns in mind... Certain concerns that relate to a dead seer and signs that point to his return. As the events of this tale unfolds, the 13-horned giant quietly watches, for none can escape the gaze of the keeper of time... Satinav!			",60,37,0,33,11,0,2

												Eh it was allright, but would not recommend still unless a die hard adventure game fan.Positives:1.The puzzles were logical most of them time and the difficulty system plus helping options made the game completeable fast. To people like me who hate to be stuck in one place for hours and hours due to some meaningless oversight, this was very welcome.2. The art and backrounds are beautifulNegatives:1.Not sure what was up with the graphics in this game - there was quite a bit of stuttering and from other reviews i see other people have had similar problems.  Though i admit never tried to fix this issue. 2.Story was a bit too much mumbo jumbo magic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me - expected in adventure game i guess, but still lost track quite fast how the story was going.  3. Lack of animations for characters - all the moving, talking, actions looked awkward from characters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a quite joyful point and click adventure. The story behind it is not too complex, but satisfying and will drive you forward. The playtime is about 10 hours, if you do not care about all achievements. I recommend it to fans of The Dark Eye - universe, but it's fine for anybody else too. The price of 20€ is justified with a nice game with gorgeus artworks.CONS:Due to it's rich painted artwork backgrounds and animation style, it does not have a lot of frames per second. It reminds a bit of stop motion animation. At the beginnig it's a bit hard for your eyes, but you get used to it fast.			",137,46,3,24,10,0,21

												As far as Chains of Satinav goes when it comes to the rest of Daedalic Entertainment's games, this one is very true to form: Excellent artwork, clever puzzles (admittedly a little too clever in my experience, though I'm no expert point and clicker by all means), an intriguing world and slightly cringeworthy English voice-over work here and there. The latter may be something you have to overlook when you're used to the more high-budget kind of games, but it definitely pays off on the long run. The more time you invest in this game, the more you will feel involved in the story and its two main characters.Especially the quirky Nuri makes for a fun companion throughout the game, though it's a bit of a shame that some of the in-line jokes are sometimes lost in translation since German is the main language here. Nonetheless, the English voices get the job done, especially since it's worth working your way through this game in order to get to the next installment in the series, Memoria, which is most certainly worth looking into as well!

												I really liked this game, logical puzzles, cute story, interesting ending, beautiful illustrations, and daedalic mechanics. If you want to know more, you better read someone else's review.One word of advice for advanced adventure gamers: The puzzles are not hard, so if you really want to enjoy this game first play it on hard mode, even if you plan on playing it a second time for all the achievements (if you want 100% you have to play the game twice on each difficulty level, which sucks -and no you can't just load your last save and change it to easy, I tried). After that you can breeze through your second easy-mode playthrough in half an hour. If you're not a begginer do yourself a favor and don't start it on easy mode, it will get seriously -and boringly- way too easy. Unless you're into that kind of visual-novely stuff, which is also cool.Have fun!			",184,278,1,32,14,0,17

												The first of the games set in The Dark Eye universe, Chains of Satinav is a story about a young bird catcher, Geron, who is much maligned by his home kingdom of Andergast for supposedly being a bearer of bad luck. He seems to get his chance for some respect when he wins a local contest, only to run into a fairy by the name of Nuri, who eventually goes on the run with him as the Seer, an enemy thought dead 13 years ago, appears to be returning and out to capture her.As someone who played the sequel, Memoria, first, the story probably lost some of its impact for me, especially since even disregarding spoilers, I think Memoria tells a more interesting story about time, not to mention the fact that Sadja is a better developed character than Geron. Regardless, if you find The Dark Eye universe at all interesting, I think the game is worth playing. The artwork is top-notch and the gameplay is, for the most part, reasonably intuitive.

Several moments of ""how the hell was I supposed to figure that out?!"" here and there but solid puzzles for the most part.Really beautiful art as you can see in screen shots.

												A gratifying yet not quite extraordinary adventure.  This was another very pleasantly paced and assumbled P&C adventure from Daedalic and while I did enjoy my experience in the game it didn't wow me in ways that a series such as Deponia had.  The art style can only be described as an animated oil painting, and while the animation was only just adequate, the backgrounds in this game are absolutely gorgeous...the true selling point.  They story is captivating and the characters suffient enough to carry it although I did find the end a bit anticlimactic.I have to say, for a P&C, it was pleasant to find so many straight forward puzzles.  I love the genre and grew up with it, but i have low tolerance for frustration and will often ""walk-through"" before ripping my hair out trying everything against everything in my inventory.  Most of the solutions all made pretty clear sense.  Of course in the second half of the game there are a couple of instances of old adventure game pitfalls where I found myself saying, ""come on, really??"" when the solution was presented, but overall an easy play for a casual P&C adventurer. I enjoyed it but I'm not raving.  My recommendation is wishlisting it until another sale comes along.			",80,87,0,9,14,0,3

												A dark and thrilling tale of a young man named Geron travelling across the realm in hopes of reverting the dark prophecy bestowed on his land. He's no hero though, and everyone blames him for being the herald of doom which is obviously not encouraging at all, his journey neither easy nor glorious. As for the gameplay, it's not the most challenging quest out there, but at the same time the game never gives you clear hints to your actions so you have to pay attention. The storyline is really charming and has a strong ""dark European medieval fantasy"" feel to it (well, I suppose it's only natural, considering the Dark Eye setting), and the backdrops are breathtakingly beatiful, each scene working towards creating memorable atmosphere of the whole game. Voice acting was better than I've expected, but it's no Deponia. Overall, I'd recommend spending some time on this game even if you're not too keen on point-and-click adventures. It's an enjoyable experience similar to reading a good book.			",130,73,0,66,20,0,22

The game is a bit really short for 19.99 so better get a discount of 50% or higher.I give this game 86 % personally (not so good ending (story, outro), short playtime for the normal price (if you know the game 2nd walk can be done between 1,5-2,5 hours) but with discount and for Point & Click fans it has some hours of fun. Give it a chance. It has enough qualities for some enteraining hours . Thank you for reading and hopefully enjoying this game and then go to the sequel ""Memoria"".			",2545,1142,74,266,298,25,355

												Decent enough puzzles and stunningly beautiful graphics (albeit a bit marred by the clunky animations), some good world-building (but a little disjointed from lack of attention) and two increasingly tiresome protagonists, all bound together by constant but actually irrelevant talk of fate, destiny, and time. I honestly don't know whether to recommend this game or not. Thank goodness for the small mercy of being able to click through the dialogue. I mean, if you want a story about a magical bird girl and her reluctant sidekick-turned-boyfriend(?) fighting against crows/ravens and a dude who can control the future via stories/prophecies, all set in a vaguely mediaeval/pre-industrial Germany, just go watch Princess Tutu.

												From the beggining of the game, what grabs your eye is the graphic design. It immediatelly anchors you to the atmosphere, which is something that i as a visually oriented person throughly enjoy. The characters, while not may help to make the exprience even more engaging. Really the only fault i would find is that at 10h it might seem a little short. That being said, the feeling that the story went by so fast, and the wishing that it would last longer is often the trademark of the genre, is it not?I should perhaps note that the puzzles in the game, while fun are not extremelly difficult, so if that is what you are looking for you might consider another game. However if you are like me and are interested in a good story, then i'd recommend this game with all my heart. Because in the end heart is this game's greatest strenght, that and the fact that throughout the game it  leaves you entirely enchanted.Ps. Oh and by the way the story does last longer as it is continued on in the sequel Memoria, the link to which you should see below and which game i'm told even surpasses this one (i've not played it as of yet, but i believe my source)			",122,46,1,23,9,2,5

												Loved this game. Great artwork and story. Characters were good, but I absolutely hated Geron's voice. He basically whispers throughout the game and his voice is completely unrealistic. I actually got sick of his voice and played the end part of the game without headphones. It was that grating. The other characters' voices were decent. I liked Nuri, she was nice.

												Excellent pont and click adventure for anyone that likes the genre and especially if a fantasy setting also appeals to you. The story is solid and the characters are likable. A few really difficult puzzles here and there that may require a guide to avoid frustration. Several moments of ""how the hell was I supposed to figure that out?!"" here and there but solid puzzles for the most part.Really beautiful art as you can see in screen shots. And best of all, it is the prequel to what is supposed to be one o0f the best point and click adventures of recent years, ""Memoria"".If you are hesistant, wait for a sale. But those that are looking for a solid adventure game, this one comes reccomended.			",262,111,2,25,18,8,18

												A gratifying yet not quite extraordinary adventure.  This was another very pleasantly paced and assumbled P&C adventure from Daedalic and while I did enjoy my experience in the game it didn't wow me in ways that a series such as Deponia had.  The art style can only be described as an animated oil painting, and while the animation was only just adequate, the backgrounds in this game are absolutely gorgeous...the true selling point.  They story is captivating and the characters suffient enough to carry it although I did find the end a bit anticlimactic.I have to say, for a P&C, it was pleasant to find so many straight forward puzzles.  I love the genre and grew up with it, but i have low tolerance for frustration and will often ""walk-through"" before ripping my hair out trying everything against everything in my inventory.  Most of the solutions all made pretty clear sense.  Of course in the second half of the game there are a couple of instances of old adventure game pitfalls where I found myself saying, ""come on, really??"" when the solution was presented, but overall an easy play for a casual P&C adventurer. I enjoyed it but I'm not raving.  My recommendation is wishlisting it until another sale comes along.			",80,87,0,9,14,0,3

												The sad story is interesting for fairy tail lovers, not so good like other epic games of Daedaldic Entertainment, but you should test it. The graphics are good/okay. The sound is not bad. The game is a bit really short for 19.99 so better get a discount of 50% or higher.I give this game 86 % personally (not so good ending (story, outro), short playtime for the normal price (if you know the game 2nd walk can be done between 1,5-2,5 hours) but with discount and for Point & Click fans it has some hours of fun. Give it a chance. It has enough qualities for some enteraining hours . Thank you for reading and hopefully enjoying this game and then go to the sequel ""Memoria"".			",2545,1142,74,266,298,25,355

												Daedalic has done it again. They've won me over with an absolutely charming story.Now, let me start of by mentioning the drawbacks of the game. The voice acting is a hit or miss kind of situation. Some voices like the main characters, Nuri, Geron, and the Raven, were alright most of the time but others like that one eyed creature, the fairy queen, and the dwarf were so laughably bad that I had to turn down the volume. I just read the subtitles. But that brings up another problem. Something definitely went wrong with the english translation because there are a few awkward yet brief pauses and bad logical leaps with the writing. And the puzzles were a bit too easy to go through. The game also drops frames hard when real time texture compression is turned on.However, the story and the characters were just so damn charming and endearing that I just had to know how things would turn out for them. The story has that same fantasy feeling I had playing through games like the Longest Journey and Dreamfall. The music and the art is also fantastic. If given the chance to buy the soundtrack and artbook, go ahead. It's not a bad move.I would definitely recommend The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav to anyone that loves fairytales and has the patience for the drawbacks I mentioned.			",164,42,3,26,5,3,33

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #37 - The Dark Eye: Chains of SatinavThe Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a point and click adventure game.  It's based on a pen and paper German RPG that I knew nothing about beforehand.  I'm also normally not much of an adventure game player, so this is definitely the kind of game I wouldn't have normally picked up.That said, I ended up enjoying this game more than I expected.  Only playing for an hour makes it pretty impossible to judge the game on it's story, but I'll say that I liked what I saw of it.  I wasn't rolling my eyes at any obvious cliches.  And I appreciated that the game doesn't beat you over the head with a ton of exposition at the start of the game.  All of the dialogue with other characters is voiced, and I thought the voice acting was pretty good.  I really liked the art style, and felt all of the backgrounds were really well done.As with any adventure game you can expect to be solving puzzles.  From what I saw this looked like the typical point and click adventure kind of fare: finding the right objects and using them on the right things.  One thing I liked was the ability to turn hotspots on or off.My only issues with the game had to do with the game engine itself.  I wished the transition between areas was a little quicker and more seamless.  Moving the mouse felt very sluggish at times, and there isn't any way to change the sensitivity.  The mouse cursor would also jump around when first transitioning to a new area, kind of like things were still loading in the background and slowing everything down.Overall the game engine just didn't feel very optimized.  I tried switching to full screen instead of windowed mode, and this didn't make any difference.  This brings up another annoyance in having to restart the game just to switch between windowed and full screen mode.  For what it's worth, I have a midrange desktop and I'm not using onboard graphics.  Everything I have is well above the listed system requirements.Despite my nitpicks with the game engine, I would classify these more as annoyances that didn't prevent me from enjoying the game.  Anyone who enjoys a good adventure game should feel right at home here.			",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												Although I enjoyed the game to some extent, I ultimately wouldn't recommend the game to my friends. The art is beautiful, and some of the puzzles are a fun kind of challenging. The story and universe is kind of interesting, but there are parts of the storyline in game that are silly;  After telling Nuri multiple times to not touch the fairy stone, she touches the fairy stone for no apparent reason.  After a while, I found myself referring to game guides to solve the puzzles. Sitting there trying every possible combination gets old and takes away from the game. I finished the game because I was compelled by the story and the art, but I don't feel like I beat the game because I just followed game guides.			",8,13,0,1,0,0,1

												The expressions used in the game are always a bit overblown and the whole game leans somehow too far to the archaic side. Where there are quite a few adventures that surpass this one easily with a nice humor and unique flavour it lags behind. It isn't a bad adventure though, and especially genre fans should find it appealing. Puzzles are alright and never unfair. Although at times I had to experiment some. Animation looks clumsy for a modern game but the artwork is beautiful. I especially liked the final setting with the harp.			",48,48,0,24,8,1,5

												I played less than an hour of this game before returning it. The art is lovely, but the story absolutely sucks. I detested the protagonist almost immediately - he whines his way through everything (and it's not just the voice-acting - the best voice-acting in the world can't downplay dreadful dialogue). I disliked literally every character I was introduced to apart from maybe the bird-catcher, and he was around for about five minutes. The fairy girl, for one, appeared to be legitimately moronic, with a knack for doing the absolute worst thing in any situation. I think this might have been an attempt at making her seem winsome, but all it did was make me want to strangle her.Speaking of moronic, the very first puzzle appeared to have been designed for unusually slow six-year-olds. And the idea that THIS was considered a test to find a ""champion""... I have no words.I suppose it's possible that I just hadn't spent long enough on the game, that there might be character growth and a good story buried under there somewhere, but life's too short to suffer one's way through a game that has all the earmarks of truly terrible writing.

												Most of my ""play time"" with this game was spent alt-tabbed out of it, which is pretty telling in itself.The primary problem was that the story simply didn't grab me and thus I had nothing pushing me forward other than my completionism. Nothing much actually happens aside from the events right at the start that set things in motion and a sudden ""turn of events"" some two thirds of the way through the game, nor do you learn much of interest about the plot after the start of the game.The protagonist is relatively uninteresting to start with and he doesn't develop or ""grow"" during the course of the adventure. Same thing with the relationship between the protagonist and his protegé - it doesn't develop meaningfully and nothing really happens, with one noteworthy exception; by the end they still haven't really said anything to eachother that couldn't have been said within the first five minutes.When it comes to the puzzles I thought they required too much lateral thinking and occasionally simply trial and error - as opposed to logic - to solve. Too often it wasn't quite clear what the purpose of doing certain allowed actions was, and I used items on other items or hotspots ""because I could"", and was left wondering why until a contrived reason materialized itself after having done some other things.The voice acting was pretty good. The graphics, well you can check those in the screenshots yourself. I thought they looked good to begin with, but by the end I had kind of stopped noticing the backgrounds and just looked around for the hotspots in order to get it over with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another masterpiece from Daedalic Entertainment. You play as Geron, a bird catcher, whom folks constantly accuse him that he brings bad luck. Geron looks for a chance to show his worth to the King, but instead, he eventually embarks on a dangerous adventure, in order to save the world from a powerful enemy, with the help of a naive fairy. Beautiful game, with an excellent storyline. You can never go wrong when you choose a game from Daedalic Entertainment.			",374,144,15,33,42,8,47

												Nope, I'm done too... I've stuck with the game for 3 or 4 hours, and I'm finding nothing to keep me. I bought the entire Deadelic bundle for a mere pittance so I'm not overly worried but I really hope they improve from this their first attempt! The game has very positive reviews, and most reviews say how amazing the game is and I wonder what game these people are playing, because it doesn't seem to 'me' to be this one! The graphics are nice, well drawn, and engaging... but thats all it has going for it!The ruination of the game is the worst voice acting I have possibly 'ever' heard. I mean truly its abysmal! I could do better! Since when does your voice trail off and become lower in pitch when asking a question for example?When they were recording this in the studio, how did no one realise it was this awful? Were they strapped for studio time, and had to go with first takes?The story is terribly slow, and not engaging in anyway because the stunted and often amazingly forced dialogue makes you groan and just simply not care about any of the characters. I have repeatedly tried to murder Nuri because she's so damn annoying but the equally annoying main character just keeps refusing!I'm sorry but in my mind (a fan of point and click adventures since the early days - although I confess as to not playing many for years) there is very little here to entertain			",161,66,10,50,24,1,20

												Another quality adventure title from Daedalic. The story was very good and much darker than any of their other games I've played. The puzzles were extremely well designed. They all fit into the story line and made sense; no randomly clicking and combining everything with everything in order to try and progress. If you thought about it, the solution always was logical. The difficulty is never that high as there are never more than 3-4 screens that you can traverse through at any given point.  Rather than limit freedom this seemed to make the plot's pacing better and I enjoyed the design choice.  The main character has a special ability to break certain things with a spell and then to fix them which made for some very clever puzzle solutions. The dialog did a great job of directing you too so that you always knew what your objectives were. The voice acting was hit and miss, but mostly miss.  This is too bad because the writing is very good and there is a major disconnect between what you the player are seeing/feeling and how the voice actors portray this in their performances.  The animation style took a little getting used to.  The had drawn artwork is beautiful so it is too bad that the animation doesn't live up to it.  It was kind of distracting for the first 30 minutes or so and then I either got used to it or it got better. (Most likely I just got used to it)  Even with its faults in animation and voice acting, the tale, the excellent puzzle design, and the dark fantasy setting is good enough that I was able to look past the flaws and really enjoy the adventure.  The ending left a lot of loose ends so I am looking forward to playing the sequel, Memoria soon.  Hopefully they fix the faults of this one and it can be really great.  Another must play for point and click adventure fans.			",477,268,11,62,20,2,54

												Beautiful but mildly infuriating, and absolutely mediocre.The artwork looked lovely and the story was intruiging which was what prompted me to get this game. However, there is very little else enjoyable other than the graphics. 1) Mechanics was awkward, movements were staggered between transitions. This was very distracting. 2) Puzzles sometimes made little sense. In more than a few occasion you're left with very little hint as to what you're supposed to figure out or what the goal is. Puzzles follow poor and warped logic. 2) Little character development: This is what got me the most. It was incredibly difficult to become attached to the characters or feel anything for them. The main character, Geron, exudes arrogance and incompetence. He consistently lies to Nuri, the other character, and treats her like a child. He shows little change from this shallow character throughout the game. He makes the whole gameplay feel like a chore.Nuri's character is even ""flatter"" and one dimensional, she rarely makes any meaningful dialoogue beyond random comments and giggles. She causes trouble and makes irrational demands. It was difficult not to feel annoyed of her. 3) Dull story line. Characters come and go, each with a brief dialogue and brief interaction. They throw all these details of folklore at you but it is so poorly presented and lackluster. Overall, I was really looking forward to loving this game. The non-existent character development and the awkward voice acting made it feel like I was playing a online point-and-click flash game, where the characters' existnece was just for solving ridiculous puzzles.  After a few hours I felt myself wishing the game to be over already , I will not recommend this game.			",63,8,0,7,4,0,3

												Aaah...Daedalic really knows how to make a good title. It's one of those star-crossed lovers kinda story, bittersweet. The ending left me craving for more, and I was pleasantly surprised that there IS a sequel. Music wise, well let's just say that some of the tracks can really evoke emotions. Thumbs up for story, art and english voice actings.			",87,39,2,10,12,1,21

												Well... it is hard to recommend this game but it is a pity to overlook. I played Memoria first without knowing this game beforehand. Thankfully it doesn't feel like I miss anything because those two are hardly connected. I played Memoria and Blackguard and I like them. That is why I gave this game a shot. But I try to like this and I just could not. I could not enjoy this game more than halfway of the story and I finished it just for a sake of finishing it. Let me tell you why.THE (somewhat) GOODThe gameplay itself is decent (can get illogical and frustrating sometimes but it is still quite enjoyable). It has a gorgeous drawing but clanky animation. The DARK EYE universe provides amazing concept and setting and interesting characters but there are hardly smooth development between them and convincing voice acting. The BGM and sound effect are amazing, no doubt.THE BADThe flop of this game is actually the story. It is so weak and cliche. The evil is just there because it has to be evil in the story. Many of side characters seem useless to the story (and their own problem) other than to provide you necessary items. Throughout the game I feel lost on what is what, what is going on and what to do because there isn't useful summary. THE VERDICTI can't really recommend this. Pick up Memoria or other puzzle game like The Longest Journey series, Agatha Christie ABC Murder, LIMBO, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Portal series, Cradle etc. Buy this if this game on sale or you have some more money left to spare.

												Really beautiful scenery, really... but that's about it on the +'s.The main character is a whimp, his protoge is a complete helpless lady and there is no character development - oh, and the evil guy wants to destroy the world because he is evil. The characters really lacks imagination. The voice acting is mostly cringe-worthy lacking emotional context in the deliveries and the main character whispers every line in total nihilism, ruining all potential emotional experiences.I still forced myself through the game. Some puzzles were interesting, but too many were artificial, illogical and boiled down to try everything on everything in every order. I generally can look past such flaws to a degree if the story intrigues me. But this is not the case here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this on sale for $4, and I'm glad I didn't pay more. The graphics are gorgeous, but the animation is kind of stiff. Reminded me at times of Klutch Cargo, if anyone remembers what that was. The puzzles are interesting up to a point, but then it crosses into ""what do the programmers want me to do"" rather than ""how do I solve this problem"". I got completely stuck in one place, so I looked up the walkthrough. The solution is so convoluted, I don't think I'll be going back. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea.			",12,11,0,9,1,0,5

Spent a solid 16hrs playing wholly imersed today, no booze no tv which is impresive considering my modus operandi playstyle, and theres another game in the series.

												I liked the story, and the way the game played, but the puzzles didn't make much sense to me. Many times, I would be totally surprised that stuff would work because it made no sense. Eventually, this became a chore and I just started following a walkthrough online, but then the fun was drained out of it. I made it to chapter 4 and just don't feel like playing it anymore. These don't seem like real puzzles to me, but rather an exercise of gathering stuff and clicking on stuff till stuff combines and then clicking that combined stuff on lots of other stuff untill some stuff happens. Pretty frustrating. I got this and Memoria on sale, so I'm off to see how that one is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: The artwork is very charming. The two spells provide an interesting, but ultimately underutilized device.Cons: For a game of this genre, there needs to be either some challenge/innovation in the puzzle solving, or some degree of user determination (or otherwise deep investment) in the narrative's course.  Simply put, either the mechanisms by which the narrative is unlocked piece by piece need to be entertaining and satisfying, or the decisions that move the narrative forward need to be engaging. Ideally, both. In this instance, the plot plods on deterministically with zero input from the player as to how relationships develop, characters grow, and moral decisions are made. Which may be due to a total lack of meaningful relationships, character growth, or moral decisions in the narrative. This is a shame, as there was ample opportunity for meaningful choices to be made that were passed up instead for rather trite and forced outcomes. As to the ""puzzles"", there was always one solution, and it almost always veered between extremes of either being blatantly easy or almost completely unintuitive. Frequently I found myself clicking things into place with no real concept of what the intended outcome was supposed to be until it happened.			",28,11,0,10,4,0,15

												(+) The artwork is superb, leading to a memorable atmosphere...(-) But IMO the protagonist, in a more-or-less typical Daedalic-way, was slightly too easygoing to really get into the game.(+) The story is captivating, some of the characters are interesting, the voice acting is OK...(-) But neither is really that special. Given the great setting, there is a lot of room for improvement.Puzzles are more challenging than those in e.g. Harvey's New Eyes, but easier than they were in e.g. Grim Fandango.In short, this game could have been great, but it's decent instead. If you liked The Whispered World, or found that one a bit too quirky but loved the artwork, I'd certainly recommend this one. Otherwise... I don't know. Maybe if it's for sale.			",59,41,0,13,2,0,1

												First attraction: artistic style.  The game did not disappoint.  Very impeccibly done scenes with amazing detail.Second attraction: interesting universe (although somewhat formulaic)And now for the negatives:I really wanted to love this game as others did too but in the end I found myself forcing to finish it...which is always a bad sign.  My major complaints are more systemic to Daedelus as a developer than anything.  I have played many games of theirs...favourite thus far is Deponia series.  Voice acting aside from narrator is atrocious.  I played most of the game with the voice off.  This is actually kind of funny...but I kept encountering a bug where after 30min+ of play, voices would cut out.  On top of being unacceptable in a normal game, I got used to it because the voice acting added nothing for me.  I think this is in part of possibly the actors being non-native English speakers but for me, the pacing, the emphasis, the mispronunciation drove me nuts.  It is a really bad sign when a player cannot stand the voice of the two main characters.  Same problem happened in Whispered World.Game engine needs to be SCRAPPED.  It shouldn't take 3 minutes from executing the game to start playing.  The framerate is horrendous.  Saving/Loading takes forever.  Switching scenes takes forever.  I have a high-end system.  These things shouldn't happen.  I had the same compliants in ALL previous adventure games by Daedelic.  I feel like I am playing an adventure game from the early 2000s.  Scrap it!!!At this point, I probably won't be playing any more Daedelic games until these types of issues are resolved.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not sure if I can recommend this. The story hinges on nothing but stereotypes and boring 'fairy tale' names to tell a mediocre narrative. The gameplay is alright as far as puzzle clickers go but near the end the gameplay devolves into ridiculous logic in order to solve puzzles. Topped off with weird glitches that they somehow couldn't fix (dissapearing characters, getting stuck in a gamebreaking state) makes this game somewhat unsatisfying. ",146,47,4,18,8,1,7

												As much as it pains me, I cannot give this game a positive recommendation based on my experiences playing it.I am a child of the Sierra past and have always held a place in my gaming heart for the genre.  The plot (what I've discovered of it) is well told.  The graphics are rich and, as a point-and-click adventure, the game is better than most.  Up until this point, Daedalic has never failed to keep me engaged with their work.There is, however, a single glaring issue that I cannot ignore (which has completely killed any chances of my enjoying this game):The game is utterly unplayable due to *constant* runtime errors and crashing.  The crashes happen ALL THE TIME.  I can't progress through a single chapter without (at least) twenty crashes.  It happens every single time I get through a sequence of the game.I've scoured all the forums, from GOG, to Steam, to Daedalic.  I've read other reviews (it seems there are few on Amazon that mirror my own frustrations, as well).  I've changed graphic settings.  Performance settings. Uninstalled/reinstalled/updated my DirectX more times than I can count - to no avail.It's hard to enjoy a game that crashes every minute (which is not an exaggeration).  l wish I could recommend the game because, aside from that issue, I am sure I'd have given it game a glowing review.  To be fair, not everyone has these issues.  Maybe it's a Windows 7 sort of thing (though it is never mentioned that there is incompatibility).  Or a specs things (my specs fall within the guidelines stated on the store page).  This is not their review, however.  It is mine and as such, if major errors and crashes keep me from an enjoying a game, I cannot recommend it.			",994,632,19,166,95,10,160

I find the general vibe and atomosphere of all of the Daedelic adventure games to be a bit creepy and unsettling and generally not enjoyable, and The Dark Eye is no exception. That is just me though, if you like it, you will probably like this game (assuming you can run it without crashing).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anaive, cute female character and a for no absolute reason heroic male character. All the basic cliche toppings: evil orcs, stubborn dwarves, knights that can be persuaded to help the hero because it would make the female character happy. Seriously.I wouldn't recommend this.

												I love adventure games in general, and point-and-click-games in particular. Naturally, I wanted to play a game that looked aesthetically pleasing, with lots of voice acting and from a publisher I've enjoyed in the past. So, I bought Chains of Satinav.I must say, I was disappointed. The pace is too slow with a lot (I mean A LOT) of story-telling via cutscenes, in between unchallenging puzzles and confusing world design. The characters have got some cool special abilities, like breaking and mendning objects by magic, which very well could have been this game's rescue, but it falls too short due to a limited amount of use and a far too linear story. The game is good-looking, and the acting is good, but it's not a game I enjoyed playing. 4/10. If it was a bit more challenging and ""open"", to fit in with the game mechanics (like different ways to solve puzzles, different paths to take, etc) this would be a lot better. But the fact is, it's more an uninteresting movie with quicktime events.			",407,244,7,75,47,3,67

												I really wanted to like this game but the story is just a standard flat generic fantasy narrative. Destitute youth Geron meets mysterious girl Nuri. Over the course of the adventure the two fall in love for some reason. While they struggle against a vague antagonist with nebulous goals. Visually the game’s painted backgrounds and subtle animations, have a unique feel that hints at a sprawling fantasy world is at your fingers. Yet the plot just tip toes around it giving a taste but never doing anything meaningful with the setting. Without some kind of gripping narrative to bind the point and click, gameplay together this game just dragged on for me. It also did not help towards the latter half of the game the voice actor for Geron seemed to be as bored with the game as I was.  ",322,80,4,60,28,3,49

												Well... I'd love to recommend this game because the backgrounds are very well done, and the story is well done as well. This is a point and click puzzle adventure. HOWEVER.... Some of the ""puzzles"" were so out there, that if it wasn't for the internet, I'd still be at the title screen. The ending was a let down. Only because of the abruptness of it. It's not what you expect to a degree but it doesn't give any additional information. It's more like, well here it is.... THE END... Because I'm judging the game as a whole, I'd buy it on sale with a shortcut to a walkthrough.			",100,51,0,12,8,2,8

Yes, it is beautiful and no, I don't need fancy animations to enjoy a game.  There are lots of good click-everywhere exploration games but this one requires unintuitive sequences and unneeded steps and combinations.  After the 12th time I had to refer to a game walk-through and thought, ""Really?  You're kidding!""

I'm disappointed I've spent money on a game that doesn't even work properly. I have a very good gaming laptop, so I know it's not a problem with the graphics card. So far, I haven't found a solution to the glitch, so I wouldn't recommend this game unless you want to throw your money away. Maybe one day they'll fix the problem.			",10,8,0,14,0,0,1

												I decided to play this after enjoying Memoria...Just not a great game. The characters are not as well developed as he sequel, the story doesn't hold my attention at all, and it feels like a chore to play. Uninstalled after only a couple of painstakingly boring hours of play. Memoria is the superior game between the two by far. (although Satinav is slightly better than the Deponia games)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright. This game starts off well, with most of the puzzles being pretty logical and common sensical. However, in the second part of the game, it completely devolves into the old ""try-to-combine-everything-with-everything"" approach that should have died in the 90s and stayed there. Unfortunately, a lot of Daedalic games suffer from the problem of forced, poorly though out, ""try-to-reverse-engineer-what-the-writer-had-in-mind"" puzzles that make little sense. It seems to be a common theme in most of their games.There is one saving grace:  the artwork is pretty beautiful and does a good job at transporting you to a different realm.However, even the story is pretty weak and uninteresting. Most of the characters are dull, plain and have nothing unique about them. If I don't feel like I care about the main characters and their struggle, then how am I expected to keep playing the game?If you are looking for a good adventure game that rewards you for thinking logically, and doesn't attempt to frustrate you, avoid this one. I know I will definitely be avoiding Daedalic games in the future, since they never seem to learn from their mistakes and keep reintroducing the same problem into every game they make.

												Let me preface this review by saying I've completed the game twice and gathered all achievements. Now that we have some context...- PRO'sThe games art is beautiful, everything has a hand painted look.The story is great, no spoilers. It's very nicely done and leads you on quite the adventure.The voice acting and dialogue isn't too bad.- CON'sThe game is buggy..how buggy? Read the comments in the community hub. I got right upto the end of the game and the dialogue system broke... options wouldn't appear, tried saving at the spot and reloading, it didn't work.. over an hour of gameplay was lost. I'm not the only person this has happened too.The other major hangup I had was the laggy inventory menu, it would jitter up and down, very annoying. It would've been far nicer to have the menu instantly pop up and disappear.Whilst the game looked awesome.. animations something bugged or cut off randomly.. quite weird..Loading when you want to have a conversation with someone...and then loading back to the main level view was annoyingFor all of the above reasons the immersion was ruined.OverallGreat game, great story, it's sad they've left the game with so many bugs in it because the bugs were a real let down. I wouldn't recommend the game in it's buggy state. If you want to manually manage your autosaves for the entire experience ""just in case"" then you might be able to put up with it.

												Boring game. I really tried to like it, but ended up uninstalling after about 5 hours of torture, thinking ""surely it will get better"" right?Some of the puzzles are fun, but most of them devolve into clicking EVERY POSSIBLE THING ON THE SCREEN because you've exhausted everything else that even remotely makes sense as a possible solution.Don't buy this game.

Beyond this fact, there is little to no support, unless you wish to post on the developers private forums, in german. Even then, there seems to be no help from thier end.

												Bad game, step away now. STORYThe writing is horrendous. I don't know if the original German fantasy series is this bad, but the plot is totally wishy-washy. It's about some great evil being reincarnated, so you TRICK a fairy or mentally disabled girl (depending on your perspective) into going back to her ""fairyland"". There is NO HUMOUR, and It takes itself too seriously. CHARACTERSEveryone has generic British accent. The characters also aren't even likable. Your main character is a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who doesn't really seem to care what's going on around him. He's got a wimpy magic allowing him to break fragile objects. You use this ability maybe 5 times in the entire game. The girl is mentally disabled, as I mentioned earlier. She will see a butterfly gets crushed into pus and ask, ""Is she okay?"" She talks to inanimate objects and drunk people, and gets into baths with other naked men without question...GAMEPLAYNot bad, but half the time you're running around clicking everything you can think of instead of thinking what would logically follow. I spent 7 hours on it, regret it so much.Rating: 0/10.			",113,17,4,8,4,0,9

												You call out to Summer-Rain from beyond thebathroom door, but she orders you to leaveher alone through sobs. Dejected, you returnto your room and sit in front of the computer,the steam window glaring back at you.Your brow furrows and you remember betterdays about you and Ms. Novocaine, as ifthese days with Summer-Rain are not good.Kicking yourself, you lean in front of thescreen to gather your thoughts when youglance at a game you remember playingwhile waiting for a class of Ms. Novocaine'sto end. THE DARK EYE: CHAINS OF SATINAV.You remember how it was based off anobscure DnD-like franchise, aptly named'The Dark Eye'. You remember how Ms.Novocaine put her arms around you whenher class was finished, the strong scentof cigarettes masked with mints. Shealways smiled a painful smile, that Ms.Novocaine of yours.You remember how the puzzles were simple but required you using a lot of brainwork as you were playing without a guide handy. ""One hell of mental workout"",you remember, even though the story wasto die for.In the land of Andergast, simple bird-catcherGeron finds himself tasked with ridding theland from a disturbing plague of crows by the King himself. What follows was a ragtag,gripping adventure that made you think onevery simple dialogue choice and where youwould point-and-click your cursor.But the game's real weakness you remember,was when you finished with your second playthrough to get the remaining achievements you missed out, was that Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav had absolutely no replay-value whatsoever, even for those who love maxing out a game to its 100% completion.For the original asking price of $20.00, that regular price is a bit steep for a game that could be finished in less than 10 hours. Youeven finished it in 5 hours after waiting forMs. Novocaine for her class to end, onlybefore realizing that on that day was thefirst of many warning signs that she wasnot as she seemed.Summer-Rain didn't really like the gameeither, so she just hid both after 100%-ing it.""That's right."" You think to yourself. Yousaw Summer-Rain trying the game out aftershe had heard you were playing it when Ms.Novocaine was telling a few classmates atthe time. Summer-Rain was glancing at youfrom the canteen, and you even noticed her,but Ms. Novocaine came and wrapped herarm around yours, whisking you away.You remembered how much Summer-Rain'seyes seem to plead with you, as if tellingyou not to keep going with Ms. Novocaine.You realize that the bond - the link - thechain between you and Summer-Rain stretch back farther than anything, so you run back to the bathroom door and knock desperately at it, begging forgiveness. THE DARK EYE: CHAINS OF SATINAV.Definitely not for everyone.			",30,2,1,6,0,0,3

Normally I give a game a decent try but honestly 0.6 hours was all it took to realise that of all my steam purchases this was the worst mistake. The gameplay and visuals are quite literally worse than adventure games I played 20 years ago. Even the menus are laggy and the writing is twee. How it achieved such positive recommendations is a mystery.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Graphic qualities could blend in better with themselves. They look great when the picture is still, but once your character starts moving it looks like a cheap game that has been tried to make look more valuable with the great pictures.It's really hard to know what you can and cannot do here and the scenes are very complicated. You see silver arrows pointing the ways to other scenes, you pick the first one and get into the second scene. You go back to the first scene, choose another arrow and you're back in the second scene. Wait, what? Then you try to get back into the second one but end up in a third one. Point being, it's really messed up.And since it's so hard to know what you can or cannot do or what you're supposed to do and what not, I lost the interest in the game pretty quickly. Sure it's easy to pick stuff up into your inventory for later use, but you'll find so much things that fit absolutely nowhere even though there are lots of places you can interact with that it just messes everything up.Unless you're REALLY patient and willing to do about a hundred clicks per a scene, number of scenes early in the game being more than four, I do not recommend the game.Plus, the character you play as seems like a whiney little kid who goes to the guards when others don't play fairly with you (even when they haven't done anything against the rules, which, btw do not even exist)... Nuh-uh. It's a no-go.			",80,23,0,8,6,1,2

Worst of all, the ending sucked big time which led to checking that it was the actual ending after which game was removed from hard drive.  Still a few German language issues in the game.

												Eh, got this in a bundle and objectionably speaking I guess its an allright game if your into point and click puzzle games.  Its exactly the same as every other game I've dabbled in this genre.That being said if you are not into those type of games I wouldnt recommend this game to be the one to break into the genre with. I beat the game just cause it was in my library, im not really a fan of these type of games. So, unobjectionably speaking: The story was nothing to write home about and the puzzles were either easy, didnt make any lick of sense, or involved searching every pixel on each screen to find the item you needed. What little immersion you get from the storyline seems to just be there to annoy you at the cruddy ending.Leaving the game as recommended due to the fact that the real culprit here is that I'm never gonna like a game in this genre unless the story element blows me away. I dont feel like a person into this sort of game would be dissapointed if they get the game.			",70,51,0,51,26,2,42

												I have to admit, I have some reservations about recommending this game. It's a beautiful old school point and click adventure game that keeps VERY true to its inspiration. The game looks nice and has an interesting, if not necessarily stellar, story, lots of puzzles, and loads of inventor items to fondle. If you like older adventure games like Lucasarts' classics than you should probably just go ahead and get this game. It doesn't quite have the humor those older games had, but the gameplay is much the same. Unfortunately, many of the irritating aspects of those older games are very present here. Many of the puzzles require a good deal of ""inventory alchemy,"" so you'll often find yourself spending time listening to the main character repeating quips like ""What am I thinking"" a dozen times in a row as you try combining every one of your items with every other item in an attempt to figure out what arcane combination will yield a helpful result. Puzzles are also rather hit-or-miss. Most are fairly logical, but as you get closer to the end of the game they become increasingly convoluted until virtually all sense of reason is lost. I'm not ashamed to admit that there is simply no way I would have figured out that last few segments without a guide. If you can put up with these irritations, than there is a good game here, but it is very much a diamond in the rough.A note to achievement hunters: This game has some rather odd achievements for a point and click adventure game. First off, you will have to play the game multiple times to unlock everything (which I don't see any point in for this type of game). There are also a lot of achievements for performing arbitrary and time wasting actions like ""click on this thing 10 times in a row."" There is however, one interesting achievement I wish I had seen earlier. You can earn an achievement for using the ""Hotspot Highlighter"" less then 50 times in the course of a single play through.

												I do recommend this game for those who love point-and-click adventure games, but with some BIG caveats. First off, most of the voice acting really is not very good. The lead character's voice is very monotone, droll, and sounds like he just woke up. Some of the secondary characters are done well, however. Also, some of the puzzles are really, really obscure. This game will probably be good for those who are vey experienced with adventure games, but I would not recommend this to newcomers because of the frustration that some of the puzzles will cause.The biggest issue for me is the ending. That's not to say that I'm dissatisfied with the final conclusion, but the ending sequence was literally as brief as ""... the bad guy was defeated, and the hero went back to his home."" Wait, what? I can't say anything else without spoilers; but for all of the questions that were created, you get no resolution and no explanation. You get a brief statement of what happened (literally just two scenes) and the game ends. Maybe some of those questions get answered in the sequel (""Memoria""), but as a standalone game I cannot express how disappointed I am in how the endgame story played out.Still, I have a soft spot for hand-drawn graphics, which make the entirely of the game. Most of the world is colorful and vibrant; and those areas that are bleak are indeed grey and miserable. The art in this game is nothing short of gorgeous, and some of the unlocked videos show how some of the backgrounds were drawn, giving you a new appreciation for how much work goes into the art direction of the game. So, if you really like point-and-click adventures, this is worth your time. Just don't expect too much of an ending and don't expect a lot of humor. ""Chains of Satinav"" is a very dark game. If you are looking for humor, the ""Deponia"" games, also from Daedalic, are a much better choice.			",305,203,3,17,19,0,9

												I've always had a soft spot for Daedalic since Deponia and its sequels and this game continues on their line of fantastic adventure games! I love the art style and the story (a bit) but the actors could've been better. Nonetheless a great game to pass time.			",1044,453,49,146,118,11,221

												Great adventure game. Not too difficult (I've finished it in the difficult mode i.e. not hints nor hotspots) but with good puzzles. The game is  absolutely gorgeous! And the story is good enough so you will want more. The fact that it's a game taking place in the Dark Eyes Universe is a nice change from other P&C story. It's a pretty tough world, and if you like fantasy you should be please!Don't hesitate.			",188,162,1,39,10,1,8

												I give this a 7 out of 10.The art style is pretty distinctive and makes the game stand out from other adventure titles.  I personally liked it, though I'd imagine it's not for everyone.  I do wish the animations during the chat scenes were a little less stilted.  All of the lines in the game have voice acting, which is a nice touch.  The majority of the voice acting is decent, though some of them sounded like they didn't want to bother with it.  The puzzles start out in a very logical fashion and can be figured out easily enough just by following the clues the game gives you if you pay attention to what's being said and what's going on around you.  Unfortunately, in my opinion that changes part way through the game, roughly about the time you enter the fishing town.  Suddenly you'll find yourself wandering back and forth repeatedly between the same few screens over and over frustratedly clicking everything in your inventory and speaking to the same characters for a thousand times to get that one oddball thing you missed.  This seems to build up to an incredible degree near the end of the game with what I found to frankly be the most bizarre puzzle solutions ever.  The spot near the end where you put the wizard hat upside down in the chandelier and dump a decanter full of wine into it...I was shouting ""WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS???"" at the screen.  It only sort of makes sense after you're already through the end of that puzzle, but come on, really?  When you reach the final ""level"", things get a little more straight forward again, but that's mostly due to the fact that you have almost no inventory and there's not a lot of things that are clickable or screens to move between.  In spite of this, I'd still say to give this a play through.  The story made it worthwhile in the end and I'm looking forward to giving the sequel, Memoria, a try.			",496,240,3,137,37,2,105

The art work is beautiful with vivid colours, but also dark and eerie when needed.At first, I wasn't keen on the game, the style of game was not usually one I played. But as soon as I began to progress through and got involved with the story, it won me over.I would defiantly recommend this to anyone, specially if you're looking for something different to all the modern games			",24,8,0,9,22,0,3

												The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a very beatiful to look at game, quite a bit less fun to play at times, with a decent story.The artwork for this game is gorgeous.  Every visual is a quality painted backdrop with animated characters.  Music fits the setting, nothing memorable or catchy but not at all unpleasant to listen to.  If this game had any less of a beautiful front it might be easily dismissed, because at times the puzzles are just plain bad or un-fun.The game is kind it that it will let you (and I suggest you do) highlight interactables on-screen as well as highlight correct item combinations, but quite a few times item combinations or puzzle solutions are downright illogical or confusing.  Nobody likes mashing every item against every other in your inventory or against the objects on screen, and sometimes that's what you have to do.  It doesn't help that the game throws quite a few deliberate red herrings into the mix.  One notable instance is where you can put an item into a 'broken' and 'unbroken' state via magic.  There is no need to break the object to solve the puzzle, nor is there any standard for having items be breakable arbitrarilty (the character even states '(Friend name) doesn't like it when I break things.'!).  Its just there to purposefully confuse you.  Sometimes interactables may seem unacquireable or useless because the player is denied interaction, but then they become acquirable later for arbitrary reasons,  At another point, the game forces a story-irrelevant zone transition from a zone the player has explored to a new one, and the player must manually backtrack to the previous zone in order to solve a new puzzle because the story-irrelevant transition forced him to walk past a required item. The story is okay, it definitely starts out rough and a little boring but thankfully gets much better as it goes on.  I like to avoid spoilers so as always I don't say much.  Voice acting is decent, and characters are fairly distinct and again some of the later ones are more interesting along with the story.   Sometimes voice acted lines and subtitles dont match up or even give conflicting information, which can be confusing.  The game's cosmology and setting are moderately interesting, again, better as the game goes on.Point and click games are hard to say much about, usually.   If you can get past the rough start and don't mind a few gamefaqs for the stupid puzzles then its a fair-quality game with amazing visual work.  Its been on sale for as low as $7-ish before and I clocked in 10 or so hours of gameplay.  It sets up for an arguably much better sequel as well, and quality point and click are hard to come by so I think this one will get my recommendation.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												For someone who has never been a huge fan of point and click game I absolutely loved this game (and its sequel Memoria). For me, it had the complexity of a King's Quest game, but without the messing-things-up-will-lead-to-your-death-and-failure, which made it easy to sit back and enjoy taking the puzzles at my own pace and not having to worry about having not picked up a mushroom in the last area or falling to my death accidently.Thumbs Up's:+Great Story telling, you are looking for a good story you will enjoy this game greatly.+You can't die or mess up. You may struggle to find the solution, but you will never run out of time and have to worry about reloading the game or missing an item earlier on.+There's a good amount of play through, both in the player's own puzzling, but even in general content. I never felt like I cheated out of game play from cut corners.+Controls worked very nice and smoothly. I thought the inventory layout was easy to use and access. TIP: Also, by double clicking on an exit to another screen the player can skip walking animation which is helpful in some of the more twisted and roomier puzzles.+If you like snarky replies. Deaths are not allowed, so Geron will not do anything that will actually kill him, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have some funny, snarky quip to give you.Thumb Middle's:-Not a lot of replayability right away, but it's like a good book. You need to have some space to forget a bit of the storyline and how all the puzzles work, but I can see myself coming back to play this game once again after a few months or a year - and I definitely plan too!Thumb Down's:-I just don't have one for this game. I thoroughly enjoyed it.			",40,25,0,13,3,0,1

												My first reaction to Chains of Satinav's art style was ""ugh"". It's definitely strange and close to the Uncanny Valley but it very quickly grows on you, and what lies on the other side is a classic style point and click adventure which might trigger some nostalgia for the Arcadia parts of The Longest Journey, as it certainly did for me.The most interesting thing for me was that in addition to inventory puzzles, you progress by using two magic cantrips that can break or mend small objects.

												As a fan of point and click games in the 90s I've felt let down in the past by more recent P&C games found in the bargain bin. But then one weekend I stuble across a Daedalic sale and picked up this little gem for the grand total of 75p, and what a bargain it was; I'd have paid more.At first the story seemed to suffer with the old ""in a time of wibblesnaps a young faropos apprentice discovered a magical snaliff that threatened the good citizens of morhop"" that you sometimes get with over the top fantasy, but eventually the story became quite immersive and enjoyable. The voice acting also gave me a few concerns at first, the blacksmith especially, but I absolutely fell in love with the voice of Nuri and then some of the later characters with good baritone joined the cast. The relationship between Geron and Nuri as wonderful to watch unfold and I found myself investing emotionally in the characters and their quest. Truly the best part of this adventure is the wonderful tale it tells and the way it tells it.Another good point to mention is the graphics. Although the character animations are a little bit wooden, you can easily see past them when you admire the beautiful backgrounds that make up the world they live in, lots of detail went into the world and I could easily spend my time seeing new things in the background and in some cases the foreground.As for the puzzles they make up a nice learning curve that leave you satisfied when you solve them. I may have had to seek help on one occasion, but I put that down to tiredness due to me wanting to see what happens next. Apart from that they do seem to be logical puzzles until you visit the fairy realm, and even those aren't too difficult.TL;DR it's a good game buy it			",55,25,0,7,6,0,13

												I play classic point & click adventure games a lot and I also played The Dark Eye RPG in the pen & paper version in my youth. I cannot remember all facts and stories of the world Aventuria in which Chains of Satinav plays. Anyway I do not care whether the world is 100% reflected by the game. Nonetheless, the game designers have done a remarkable job to feel like being in Aventuria. And also to create a really dense atmosphere with characters that you learn to love during gameplay. Like many Daedalic adventures the story is not a simple good vs. evil plot. Below the obvious surface (evil seer, ravens, dark creatures ...) one may notice thoughts about being determined in life though people don't support you or in general whether ends justifies the means (lies).An important part of adventures are the puzzles and Chains of Satinav has a lot of good ones (especially in the faerie world). Unfortunately there are also times when the puzzles become easier again. Why? Although I appreciate that Chains of Satinav takes you to many places, the problem here is that some of them are very restricted. You cannot go further until you solve that handful of puzzles which makes it too easy sometimes and makes the game feel too 'vertical'. What was really refreshing however was the idea of having a destruction and (later) a repair spell in your repertoire which distinguishes the adventures from others a little bit. Those spells are also really well woven into the other puzzle sequences.The world is drawn by wonderful fantastic sceneries which fit very well to the various places the adventure takes you to. The animations could be smoother though. The voice acting is done very well at least in the German version I played - whereas the music is let's say unobstrusive and could be diversified more and emphasize some events better.A very underrated adventure in my opinion. All in all a game that I really enjoyed a lot. I will miss Geron and Nuri.			",19,16,0,3,0,0,8

												This is a pretty good point/click adventure with a medieval light-fantasy setting (fairies and magic, but no elves, dwarves, dragons, etc).  Not too long (around 15 hours), and accomplishing tasks is fairly logical.  There are a few instances where you might get stuck and start combining everything together to try and make something happen, but when you finally get it, it usually makes sense and doesn't seem random.  The game rewards a sharp eye, but nearly every object you need is in plain sight when you look closely.  The story is your typical ""lowly peasant becomes hero"" fare, but it develops pretty well until it unravels a little near the end.  Nothing to do with the game, but Interesting that ""Satinav"" backwards is ""vanitas"" which is latin for ""vanity"".  I will probably play the sequel, Memoria, as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't know much about this game before I played it, It mostly got my attention because it was made by the same guys that did The Whispered World. It's a very good point 'n click adventure, set in your typical fantasy world with elves, dwarfs, orcs, wizards, etc. This might sound pretty unoriginal, but the thing is most games that explore epic fantasy are RPGs, or action games, hack & slash, etc. It's actually uncommon to see a story-driven adventure game with no combat at all explore this kind of setting.The graphics are exquisite. The backgrounds are amazing, very detailed, and the character design is great. The bad part is that, just as with most games from Daedalic, animations aren't on par with the artwork. But they do their job and I can't blame them too much. They're not a huge studio, and animations take a lot of time, and money!The story is well written, and the characters are likeable. I felt pretty absorbed into the plot. And for an adventure game, I should say it's one of the easiest ones I've played, but still was fun to go through it. Just for that, it would be a good choice for begginers. But if you just like adventure games, I think it won't dissapoint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a point-and-click adventure game that is the prequel to Memoria, as you play as Geron, the ""birdcatcher"", in his tale as the hero of Andergast.  I can't really say much without ruining the very indepth storyline, but this is a very fun puzzle-like adventure game incredibly similar to the playstyle of the Secret of Monkey Island series.  It is both artistically beautiful and creative, with a calm and soothing soundtrack, and a fantastic storyline.Kids of the 80's and 90's will surely love this game, as it brings back a sense of nostalgia, yet it managers to cater to younger and older generations as well.  This game is well worth the $20, along with its sequel--although I highly recommend you play Chains of Satinav beforehand, as it really sets the foundation of this brilliant story.I rate this an 8.3 out of 10.

												Chains of Satinav is about a sassy dude who's constantly down on his luck, untill he must capture a fairy and everything gets much worse. Some of that may sound familiar... But it's hardly a bad thing.This game is the second time I made a real effort to play a P&C Adventure, after I have No Mouth, And I Must Scream. Broken Age doesn't count, because it's short and unfinished at this time.I'm putting this up front, Chains of Satinav is a great game, and it's baffling nobody ever talks about it. It's set in a world that now crosses over with multiple games from different genres, so there's a ton of worldbuilding through conversation and observation. The conversations themselves feel very real for a basic go-through-all-the-options dialogue tree system, mostly in part to the voice acting. The puzzles can be difficult, but make perfect sense in comparison to standard combine-items-to-see-what-works fare. Sometimes it makes use of options you don't really know are there, but the game does tell you what you need for the situation, you just gotta figure out how to get it. Sometimes you need to revisit characters after a puzzle portion is solved to try and advance the puzzle itself, which was annoying in that one section with a bunch of other characters fighting for screen time, but it never get's harder than that thankfully. No timed item puzzles or unsolvables. No deaths.It's a really solid adventure game with endearing characters, sensible but difficult puzzles and a sequel I should get back to, as it looks like they've improved on the presentation even more. Memoria is the name, just to confuse people, but it is a direct sequel to this story and would spoil the ending almost immediately otherwise.The only problem I had overall was the janky animations. It's the only thing that kept me from playing it through when I got it. Don't let it keep you away though, because it is definitely worth it.			",205,108,2,50,23,1,34

												This is a pretty good point/click adventure with a medieval light-fantasy setting (fairies and magic, but no elves, dwarves, dragons, etc).  Not too long (around 15 hours), and accomplishing tasks is fairly logical.  There are a few instances where you might get stuck and start combining everything together to try and make something happen, but when you finally get it, it usually makes sense and doesn't seem random.  The game rewards a sharp eye, but nearly every object you need is in plain sight when you look closely.  The story is your typical ""lowly peasant becomes hero"" fare, but it develops pretty well until it unravels a little near the end.  Nothing to do with the game, but Interesting that ""Satinav"" backwards is ""vanitas"" which is latin for ""vanity"".  I will probably play the sequel, Memoria, as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lovely game with a heart warming story. Can't wait to get the next one! Two game modes means you can adjust the difficulty, means you can get help on some tricky problems! 10/10			",10,11,0,1,9,0,3

												Good point-and-click adventure. What I love about it is that most of the puzzles make sense.			",48,31,0,12,11,0,2

												I don't like a point-and-click adventure, but CoS are different. The story is so captivating, it keeps me wondering what will happen next.			",64,20,0,8,2,0,13

												A point-and-click adventure with a really nice story. I liked it. Especially, as the characters are likeable as opposed to the Deponia series.However, as often happens with Daedalic games, the puzzles are obtues and often hard to solve. But the story makes it worth to follow it (even with the occassional help of a guide).			",249,134,2,79,34,2,58

												Not Daedalic's best game, but that's by no means a reason not to play. If you enjoy point-and-click adventure, this game is worth the purchase. The puzzles are unique enough to make you think, but not so off the wall that you'll never figure it out (See: Deponia 2 and their sound menu puzzle, ugh).			",210,101,5,25,24,3,30

												I didn't know much about this game before I played it, It mostly got my attention because it was made by the same guys that did The Whispered World. It's a very good point 'n click adventure, set in your typical fantasy world with elves, dwarfs, orcs, wizards, etc. This might sound pretty unoriginal, but the thing is most games that explore epic fantasy are RPGs, or action games, hack & slash, etc. It's actually uncommon to see a story-driven adventure game with no combat at all explore this kind of setting.The graphics are exquisite. The backgrounds are amazing, very detailed, and the character design is great. The bad part is that, just as with most games from Daedalic, animations aren't on par with the artwork. But they do their job and I can't blame them too much. They're not a huge studio, and animations take a lot of time, and money!The story is well written, and the characters are likeable. I felt pretty absorbed into the plot. And for an adventure game, I should say it's one of the easiest ones I've played, but still was fun to go through it. Just for that, it would be a good choice for begginers. But if you just like adventure games, I think it won't dissapoint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
