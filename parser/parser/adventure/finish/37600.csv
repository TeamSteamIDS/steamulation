												Windosill is a lovely series of interactive scenes set on a theater stage.The goal of the game is to find a cube to unlock the door to the next room. That's it. However, you really shouldn't see it as a game, but rather more as an interactive art piece. So take your time, relax, admire, and play.It wonderfully succeeds in offering a pleasing and captivating experience to the player for a brief moment (it may take you only 15~30 minutes to finish).

												Yet another puzzle game in the style of Amanita creations, with a very distinctive surrealistic art.The game consists of 11 levels that have the same goal: you are required to move a toy car from one side on the room to another, by interacting with different abstract objects in a certain order. The objects react differently to your clicks, they surprise you with their reactions and discovering their meanings or roles is part of the fun of solving every puzzle. Putting it all together makes use of your creative thinking and seeing the picture in full is a very satisfying feeling.What I liked a lot about this game was the difficulty of the levels: they’re neither too simplistic, nor too challenging, just the right amount to keep you wanting to solve the puzzle by yourself while being tempted to check a guide. I personally didn’t need to check a guide and I managed to find the solution to every puzzle only after a few minutes of poking around. The solution was never obvious, but the puzzles are designed so that you’ll always figure it out.I think that this game would fit better on a touch screen device than on PC since it consists in a lot of experimenting with objects, clicking them or dragging them, and there’s no time limit or time requirement to solve the puzzles.Although it’s quite short (45 mins – 1h), Windosill is a wonderful and relaxing experience, and I think it’s worth the price.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page ",1642,1095,27,166,215,13,292

I think I have just witnessed a visualized concept of the imagination you once had and lose as you become an adult because life is a thing. And that was once present inside of you as a child when you look at something simple like a toy or a just a box on a shelf and develop impossible worlds that it could exist in right behind it. Either that, or I've gone completely insane. This is a physics based puzzle game on its it face. It'll physics the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. The puzzles are very simple yet obscure in their solution. Its only about 30 minutes long unless you play around with the physics for awhile. Either I'm having an very strong emotional reaction to this visual art piece or something has gone very wrong with my cognitive senses. I'm starting to tear up right now writing this after just finishing the game ...and I don't know why but I think I'm happy about it?

												There is an inherently charming and magical quality Windosill; an enchanting playfulness that can't properly be put into words and is better enjoyed first hand. A point and click puzzle game encompassing ten inordinately imaginative rooms, it's neither challenging nor lengthy, but in the same way a short picture book can be hugely delightful, Windosill succeeds because of its simple design and childish sensibilities.There is not a whole lot more I could say about Vectorpark's bite-sized treat of a game, and hopefully I don't need to to convince you it's worth your time. It's a brief expedition (about 30 minutes, depending on how good you are at puzzle solving) to another world, full of strange sounds and bizarre creatures, that is entirely unassuming in its execution. A gorgeous artistic endeavor, it shows that sometimes all a game needs to be worthwhile is a clear vision and a lot of passion to back it up. It's the sort of game that is effortlessly relaxing; best enjoyed curled up with a blanket next to the fire, sipping a cup of cocoa and just enjoying life.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

Short Verdict: A nice but short puzzle game about a toy locomotive (truck?) making its way through some levels, each with a distinct riddle. It's cute and totally worth playing, but don't expect much more than a great free flash game.Pros: Beautiful graphics with nice interactable objects Interesting puzzles with unconventional logic that take some trial and error, but don't make you go running to look on guides Manages to be fantastic, somewhat trippy, and still keep the puzzles to a sober level of difficultyCons: Very short--beat it in half an hour No replay value Almost no BGMBought on / for: I traded it for a spare bundle key/link I had. Although its price is low, considering the minutes of fun you get, it might be a bit expensive. But if you end up with it in your Library, either by getting it in a bundle, trade, or somewhere else, you should really play it!Similar games: It kinda reminded me of those Grow games from EYEZMAZE[www.eyezmaze.com].

												An interresting experience.This is Windosill, the game is about a little car, who must travel from one window to the next, in order to reach the ending.You can press pretty much anything in the windows, and there is diffrent puzzels you must solve in order to advance.The game is VERY short, it will properly take you less then half an hour to complete this game, and therefore if you are one of those types who don`t like too short games, this will NOT be for you. The game is very fantasy full, and every time you go into a new room, you are surpriesed, and really want to explore what`s inside.Short but fun, thumps up. 5 out of 10			",477,148,8,54,46,9,70

												CLICK ON EVERYTHING!!!The greatest pleasure of this game is discovery. I don't remember what it was like going to playschool when I was a wee baby LeSauve; what it was like to learn that the crayons belong inside the lines on a book and not up my nose, or how it felt to play with a small, pink, wooden block and try to force it into a tight, round, brown hole. But I can easily imagine the playful wonder and curiosity of this game comes pretty damn close to replicating those days.This is adult playtime in the form of a small Flash game, where every object demands to be interacted with as you click and drag and poke and prod at everything to find out what it does and how it works. Often you'll find it doesn't really do anything of significance, but that's not the point. The point is the FUN of seeing a mechanism in action, secondary to then trying to figure out if you can use it in any way to progress further.The real goal they ask of you is to acquire a cube on each screen which acts as the key to a door that allows your little toy vehicle to pass through and onto the next screen. There are only ten screens to explore, and the whole thing shouldn't trouble you for much more than half an hour, but in that short time there's still plenty of spectacle to marvel at as almost everything seems so foreign and alien from what you're normally used to, but will still ultimately make you smile as you discover something new and delightful... just like the wonderment of that first day in playschool.

												If you like puzzle games that are unusal and aren't bothered by Flash (yay 1990s!), you would probably enjoy this game. It's not long, so it's a great time-filler when you just need something to relax with an occupy your brain for a little while, (insomnia, anyone??) and it's also good when you need something that you can pick up and put down at will; you don't have to worry that something will kill you. It's a great thing to have in your back pocket for those times when you're going stir crazy because you have to wait for something and need something short to occupy your time that you can put down in a hurry whenever it's time to do whatever it is (like go with your relatives that are all FINALLY ready. Yay family reunions.)The puzzles are pretty engaging but you can figure them out without any hair pulling especially if you're an experienced puzzle solver. I didn't have to use any guides. Each level involves moving a car from one door on the left side of the room to the door on the right, which you have to unlock. Most of the objects you can click on do something, so it's fun to see what they'll do. I was disappointed that there weren't any achievements or anything at all, but I guess that's what you can expect for such a short game. Still it is a nice time filler and I'll keep it in mind if I need something short and relaxing.+ Positives:  * Whimsical art  * Engaging puzzles that require you to think outside the box--and sometimes even sideways! * Cute sound effects * Not too long * You can leave it without worry of dying (so it's safe to fall asleep. really! you can use this when you have insomnia. it's relaxing) * You can play with or without sound so as not to bother/wake others- Negatives * Some people really don't like Flash * Some of the puzzles really aren't intuitive * It's short. Really short. Especially if you're an experienced puzzle solver. I didn't even use any guides. I saw one picture in the forums, but it didn't help me solve anything. It was just a screenshot. I didn't count, but I think there are only ten levels or so.  * It really isn't replayable unless you *really, REALLY* enjoyed it or want to wait a year or so until you forget most of it (that said you can use steam family share and let your family play it. oops, this should have gone under positives. oh well. It seemed to want to go here) *no achievements or Steam cardsall in all, nice short game :) I'd get it in a game package deal or on sale.			",70,74,1,17,2,0,16

												My first experience with Windosill was in an online demo a few years back. Unfortunately, for a long time I couldn't remember the name of it, and have had my eye out for it ever since. Gotta say, it was absolutely worth waiting for. It's not the longest game, and none of the puzzley parts are all that strenuous. But it has a very original style, and for a couple of quid, you really can't go wrong with this game. I'd recommend buying this, if only to experience it the once. It's certainly not like anything I've played before.A very charming and likeable little game.			",262,109,6,20,36,1,13

												Windosill is small and short (literally, see below) physics-based puzzle game with an interesting artistic style.The game is basically divided into rooms, each with it's very own puzzle which you have to solve in order to proceed to the next room. Considering the game is purely based on Flash the amount and realization of physics effects is quite impressive.Unfortunately, with an average playtime of around 30-40 minutes, the game is really short and doesn't really offer that much replay value. Once you've played through the game you can probably beat it in around 10 minutes or even less.Since it's a Flash game the game size is fairly small. The fully downloaded game just takes about 7.5 MB of HDD space, so atleast it isn't clogging up the HDD.Basically half of the game can be played at [> http://windosill.com/ <] for free, so if you want to try it out I suggest you play the free demo version and save your money for another Indie game, which offers a bit more bang for the buck.

It's full price is $2.99, but I would only recommend picking it up for at most $1. If you spend more than that, you might feel a little cheated, as this feels like little more than a high quality browser game. Still, for a few quarters, I can recommend it.

Altough it is very short, I liked it very much, because of the beatiful grafics and the sometimes pretty surprising puzzles.

												I bought Windosill back when I first got my steam account in 2009 and only just got around to finishing it recently. I'm glad I did. It is a short, artsy puzzle game that takes around an hour to complete. This might sound like a negative but at the same time it doesn't outstay its welcome. Visually this game is very appealing and has a great, minimalist art direction. Unfortunately though, the puzzles are pretty hit or miss, some being very engaging and others fairly frustrating. Overall, if you're looking for something a bit different or a short game to kill a couple of hours with, Windowsill is well worth the investment.

												Great (Quick) game to pass some time. I actually bought it for my 4 year old who did a decent amount herself with some help from me.

												the worst part about windosill is it was over in less than an hour.  the flash-based point-and-click reminded me of amanita design’s games to a degree, but with a simpler visual style and no need to consult a walkthrough.  interacting with each room was interesting and fun, and the puzzles’ difficulty made a lot of sense.  based on the length i’d probably wait for a sale, but definitely worth the time it takes to play through!

												I bought Windosill back when I first got my steam account in 2009 and only just got around to finishing it recently. I'm glad I did. It is a short, artsy puzzle game that takes around an hour to complete. This might sound like a negative but at the same time it doesn't outstay its welcome. Visually this game is very appealing and has a great, minimalist art direction. Unfortunately though, the puzzles are pretty hit or miss, some being very engaging and others fairly frustrating. Overall, if you're looking for something a bit different or a short game to kill a couple of hours with, Windowsill is well worth the investment.

												I think this one stretches the definition of ""game"" a little. It's a series of puzzle rooms, some of which are straightforward, some of which require a little bit of trial-and-error. I think it would work quite well on touch-screen devices (in fact, I think there's an iPad version).It's a distracting thirty minutes, nothing more.  It goes for $2.99, which compared to some of ""games"" you can pick up in the sub-$5 category doesn't quite compare.  If it's on sale, pick it up if you want a pleasant trial-and-error, point-and-click puzzle game to distract you for thirty minutes.Hint! First level, click the light-blub.  I honestly thought that my version of Flash was screwing the game up ;)			",303,99,2,58,28,8,65

Short version: 73%Windosill is incredibly short and easy, but also quite cheap and fun. If you don’t mind paying this price for a 30-minute game, then go for it!Long version:Vectorpark is the creator of several very short Flash-based artistic puzzle games for handheld devices. Windosill is one of their full games available for PC.Although classified as point ‘n’ click, Windosill is actually a room-by-room puzzle game – there is no story or dialogue, you just find a cube to open the door and proceed. Repeat ten times to win, which takes about 15 to 30 minutes.The puzzles tend to be on the verge of getting you stuck, but not as much to resort to a guide. In this regard, the difficulty is casual level, but perfect.So… it is cheap, the art design is simplistic but great, and if you don’t mind the price, get it and have a little fun with it.

												Windosill is a small game that allows you to solve puzzles in a relaxing yet otherworldly atmosphere. You play as a toy car that travels through different rooms, each barred by a locked door. Interacting with different object and creatures inhabiting the rooms is the only way to progress. Some of the puzzles can be tricky, and the game is short, but seeing every bizarre room is worth your time. If you enjoyed playing Feed the Head, which is a free game by the same company, you will want to play this game.			",22,20,0,12,1,0,6

												The most important thing you need to know is that this game is EXTREMELY SHORT. You can beat it in about 30 minutes, give or take (depending on how clever you are).That being said, it is an extremely imaginative point-and-click puzzle game. In some ways it feels similar to Myst games in that you are presented with weird objects that do things when you interact with them, but you don't know what the objects are, and it's not clear at first why these objects do these things or what purpose it could possibly serve. So you just sort of tinker around with what you see until all of a sudden something clicks.At the same time, this game is sort of unlike a lot of puzzles and point-and-click games in that there are all kinds of superfluous interactions with objects you can have for no reason other than to engage your imagination and wonder. In that way it sort of reminds me of the old Living Books series (ask your parents) where you could click on a bunch of things in a scene and random things would happen for no particular reason. It was just fun to find them and watch them.A cool little game, but really very short.			",216,124,3,41,18,0,24

												Received this as part of a Humble Bundle deal and from a gaming perspective this would be best experienced on a tablet, something you can download once you have activated your key.  The game itself is quite short, beat all 11 ""levels"" in about 25 minutes, but it is visually appealing and there is something about exploring and tinkering with the rooms that is really pleasing/rewarding.As a note, you can play the first half of this game for free on the windosill website and determine if it is worth a purchase or not.  For full disclosure, not sure I would purchase stand alone for more than a couple of dollars but within the bundle I received it is a nice addition!			",175,43,2,16,12,1,12

												Took less than thirty minutes to finish.  Nonsensical puzzles (as in there's no rhyme or reason for progression).  No brainpower needed, just keep clicking stuff until you can progress.  Neat 3D stuff, I have a feeling this was made more as a demo for that, than an actual game to sell.			",398,131,10,69,47,6,83

												Windosill reminds me of Amanita Design's games in that you're interacting with the environment over being a character. Your goal is to get the toy train through the last door in each room. You won't spend much time on it at all (I finished in thirty minutes), but it's a very relaxing experience with excellent, sometimes surreal, artwork.			",233,375,2,75,46,1,45

												I started to play this in a generally hissy mood.And as I got into the game itself all my zesty wrath of wanting to choke puupies melted away as I became allured by all the playful physics, soothing gameplay ,brightening visuals and strikingly charming. The puzzles are very easy and fun to do- if you click around enough you'll probably slide through a level in less than ten minutes each. Truly a blissful little game, it's painfully short however- I finished it in less than 45 minutes. But if you see this for less than 2 bucks I'd say go for it, it'll be quick but I assure you'll enjoy it.But even if this isn't your thing I gaurantee it will make kids sucked in for its simplistic gameplay and visuals that are definate eye candy.

 What's strange is that I loved every minute of it. What does that say about me? I have not matured? I like to touch things? I like to molest everything on screen with my hands? Should I check myself in for a psychiatric exam? Should I try out for the ink block what do you see here test? In all seriousness this game from these people http://vectorpark.com/ is all about exploring the enjoyment and wonder which can be had from the world of touch and discovery. As adults we often forget the excitment which can be had through  innocent experimentation of poke and prod.The game has one of the stangest beginnings I have ever had in a game, especially since it doesn't actuallly tell you what you need to do, but that's half the fun of this gem. In fact it was only when I discovered the other room by accident, that the magic of this short ten room adventure began to sink in. While to some people the little accompanying toy car might seem like the main hero of this story, in actuality what really makes this flash based game come to life is you and how you choose to explore and solve how to move your toy car to the next room.A short pure childlike Toy Car adventure to infinity and beyond.Thankyou devs for making a game which knocked many years off my age...

												I got this game as a part of the Botanicula debut bundle and just got around to playing it. Windosill is a very short, point-and-click game with really minimal level design.There isn't really much to talk about. You can complete it in under an hour (most of my playtime comes from being AFK) and none of the puzzles are really puzzles. Some require a little bit of abstract thinking, but I felt like on most of them I was just clicking around and waiting. If you have the money lying around and want to kill 30 to 45 minutes, do it up. it’s not terrible by any means, but I wouldn't go out of my way to play it or recommend it. I’d give it a 4.0/10. It’s decent, but it just didn’t do anything for me.			",110,27,2,7,1,0,5

												This game is so amazing I cant even stand it. First of all, let me just say. You have no reason to not have this right now because its only like 3 dollars!? I'd buy it for 15 at least! Alright, so why is this game so cool? For me the thing I loved most about this game was the way it felt. Everything feels so perfect to interact with. The gameplay itself is immsersive. Everything moves very realistically, and nothing breaks and you can't get an object stuck anywhere. Its solid. It feels like your really just reaching out and touching and exploring the world. And the world is so creative. The art style is so clean, but simple. It's like an old kids book almost. And everything so weird, but strangly peaceful too. And ontop of that the puzzles are fun to figure out. None of the puzzles are particually hard to figure out, but the answers are never obvious either. You know what this game is like? You remeber Gepetto? The guy from Pinocchio? He had all sorts of weird little wooden clocks in his store. Very bizzare, always strange those clocks. but they were all charming in a way too. Thats sort of what this game is like. Each room gives you a bunch of strange little toys to interact with, and it's all very charming. Everything is a charming surprise in this game. I'm just really blown away by it all really.  Words REALLY don't help for this game though, because the main appeal to the game is how it feels. You definitly need to play this game.

												Weird. Magical. Charming. Bizarre.Windowsill is not so much a game, but more like a series of interactive pieces of digital art. There is an objective to click around and find a small white cube, which allows you to progress to the next area, but that's about it.It will take maybe half an hour to get through, but you will probably want to spend more time than that (but not a lot). I don't even like the art style that much, and I enjoyed playing with the interactive objects for a little while (a very little while).Very very very short. I got this as part of a bundle, otherwise I probably would not have bought it. Recommended only if you appreciate this type of art.			",346,240,8,54,48,7,30

												It's an escape game.  Nothing more complicated than that.  If you like simple puzzles with basic control mechanics, then it seems to be made solidly.  As with all of these types of games, you can simply get stuck on a single room like a napkin on a cinnabun.  I like and hate this all at the same time.  I want a challenge, but I obviously don't want to be stopped from playing the game.  This was me around room 8 or so.  I gave it a break, went back to it… nothing.  And so ends Windowsill for me.I'd call this worth it at $2.  It feels like something I would get for free in a browser on 50 different flash game site, but on the flip side, it's top notch for style and execution.6 for Visuals5 for Gameplay3 for SlantOverall : 46			",983,289,45,157,146,12,181

												This game consists of less than a dozen puzzle rooms, most of which are very simple.The puzzles were obviously designed with touch interfaces in mind, and would probably be more enjoyable on one.After the first ten minutes I was hoping it would get harder.After the second ten minutes, I was hoping it would get more interesting.After the third ten minutes, it was blissfully over.

												The f***?Windosill is a ""point and click adventure game"" where you have to get a toy car from room to room. You have obstacles in your way and you need a key for every room.Yay!:The art style is great. It looks hand drawn and the animation is pretty.Meh: The puzzles are alright? They aren't difficult but the logic needed to solve them is something you would never come up on your own. You just end up clicking on EVERYTHING and just hoping for the best It is EXTREMELY SHORT. Literally 11 rooms. You're charging 3 bucks for literally 30 minutes of game play? It could have been a bit justifiable but the game play isn't even that good. There is no story. Literally none. You have no explanation. Overall, if I had more, it would have been fine. It has potential but this looks like a demo rather than a full game. A lot of people said it was a good ""experience"" but... WHAT? There wasn't anything to be touched by. There is no story. The animations were good but what was there to be touched by? But to each their own.Buy it if you have money to spend. Other than that, just don't.			",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												It probably would have been a better experience on a tablet, I guess. Do not get me wrong, it was quite beautiful and the sound effects had a satisfying ping to them. All in all, it seemed as if the design of the mediums flash and vector graphics were a much more important factor for the game than the experience itself. Through the few levels that make up the game I was bored most of the time. When I solved the puzzles I didn’t feel like I accomplished anything, it was more luck and a bit of random clicking. If you are searching for something simple, short and pretty, this should be the game for you. Otherwise, not so much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for a game to actually play, avoid this.  More of a point-and-click flash ""game"" with no actual objectives, and seems more designed so the developers could show-off a little.  In some ways, it's kind of cool, but I was sorely disappointed at the end. (Spoiler Alert!)  There was absolutely no closure or anything to reward me for the very, very short amount of time it took to get through it.  We're talking less than 45 minutes, but I felt that it was 45 minutes of my time that was completely wasted.  And I'm not the only one, my roommate watched me play through it and was just as dissapointed as I was.  You're better off sinking 45 minutes in LIMBO, Waking Mars, or some other great platformers that are on Steam.			",371,67,11,36,69,4,75

												Windosill is a Flash ""figure out how to get out of the room"" game. Seriously, it is actual Flash. I wasn't even aware that you could sell such things on Steam. While it is okay, it falls into the category of being a short Flash puzzle game that I could've played an equivalent of on Kongregate or Newgrounds. In fact, it looks like the game is here: http://windosill.com/If that's not the full game, don't worry about it. For $0, there are a lot longer, better, and cheaper (as in free) games of this very nature all over the place.1 out of 5 foxes.			",252,85,5,23,8,4,11

												This was a cute little game. The first half of the game is free on the developer's website; however, I don't regret the purchase. It's a relaxing, soothing game, with interesting graphics, it seems to be suited for IOS devices, but I had no trouble on the computer. It reminds me of the 90s point and click games like Putt Putt, Pajama Sam, etc, and it gave me some pleasant nostalgic feelings. All in all, it was a fun little hour, and I enjoyed it. If it goes on sale, I recommend you purchase it, just for a fun little title you can play when you don't have much time, but if you don't like short games, then it probably isn't for you.Not a gamer, but I say 8/10 (I'd still love it to be a lot longer )			",34,89,0,11,9,0,3

Shame that it's so short, but for the time you play it I can't help but think you'd enjoy yourself. Probably best to only pick up on sale, though, even with its small price tag.

												Very short, but very unique puzzle game. There's only 10 puzzles, each in its own environment (world, if you will). The thing that really thrilled me the most was the visual presentation. You can finish it in anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes, but that's about the maximum you'll get out of it. Still, it's all about the experience, and ""Windosill"" offers truly something different.

												Really amazing game, mostly I'm impressed that it seems to have been created by one guy. This is a point and click puzzle game and it will probably last you less than 15 minutes of play time, but during that 15 minutes I fell in love with it. Awesome experience, definitely worth whatever I paid for it. I don't want to say much else for fear of spoiling it for you, but if you are playing and you're lost... just keep clicking stuff, its a really surreal and creative environment. Thumbs up!The artwork in this game and the puzzle difficulty level give it a solid rating for me while the length detracts from the experience. If it were 8 times as long as it is, I would still play in one sitting, because i enjoyed it that much and because it is actually that short.Overall: 7.5/10 (longer experience probably would have yielded at least 9.5)			",577,200,18,74,76,10,80

												So this is actually a game about suicide and all the stages of depression that come before it. The darkness in the beginning is literally darkness. The lightbulb represents the idea of suicide and the next room is the blissful acceptance of the resolve. Everything that comes afterwards involves the trials an individual faces before attempting suicide and it's clear that the scene with the sea was an episode of reminiscing upon everything that's happened in life. yep. it's a suicide game. 11/10 would commit again.

At first it might seem a little childish, but I assure you it's far from - the graphics are smooth all the way through the puzzle ideas are simply creative. I found myself struggling to work out some of the puzzles! The game starts with a number of items on a black screen, and by starting to interact with them you open up new posibilities to advance further in the game. I recommend this game to everyone, especially puzzle lovers. It's cheap, and for half an hour you will be entertained.			",74,30,3,8,5,0,15

You control a little toy car and your objective is to get the ""key"" to open the door to the next room. Definitely worth the $3. It's very short, so I wouldn't pay a whole lot more than that for it. Of course, check out the demo for this game. It isn't listed in the steam store page, but it's on Vectorpark's own website. http://windosill.com/online/ ",76,21,1,7,11,0,3

												Windosill is an interesting puzzle- and physicsgame with bright ideas. Your objective is simple: Find the square block to get to the next ""window"". But on some stages it's not so easy as it seems. Unfortunately I finished it after 20 minutes of playing :(			",265,20,3,30,13,0,29

												This game can take 10 mins to beat your 2nd time playing it through. It is a creative thinking game that the goal of each level is to find the key to the door to the right of the level. You sometimes might get stuck thinking about what to do to find the key to open the door to the next area, but with patients you can figure it out. Its a colorful game that uses a simple outlook on life to pass each puzzle. It can be a calming game to play and beat. When you figure each level out the game becomes more and more enjoyable. The game is amazing and is well worth any sale that comes along with this game. Get it if you like puzzle games with creativity mixed in.			",3039,1134,139,314,429,33,476

												Windosill exemplifies the spirit of the traveller, willing to lose themselves without question in a journey without destination.

												Windosill was given to me as a joke to begin with but I beat it recently and it was actually really amazing. It's not really a point and click adventure game, it is much better. It reminds me so much of the toys and what not of my childhood and it is really just a fun game, it made me smile a lot.You can play the first half of the game on their website, it's really good. You play as this little car thing and you try to get to the next area. One of my favorite areas is one with a large multiple eyed complacent monster, a much smaller purple one and then a large snake with a birds beak. When you roll in, the large eyed monster gently rolls your car back and forth, then towards the smaller one. The smaller one picks it up and rolls the wheels on the ground and rolls it to the last monster which picks it up with it's mouth and throws it around back to the first. For whatever reason this really reminded me of childhood memories and it made me smile a lot. It's hard to describe, just play			",163,24,1,12,8,1,22

												Nice puzzle game, with a great style. Each level requires another kind of solution. The fun thing is they're all quite logical if you know how it works, but challenging if you try it first.The developer's website also offers a free online demo where you can try the first levels!Has no achievements, but they really wouldn't make sense here.The only thing that's sad as well as the one thing that the game has in common with this review is the fact it's a bit too short ;)			",55,16,2,3,4,0,0

												I've played this several times off Steam which is why I have no hours here so don't worry. 10/10 I LOVE this game. It's one of my favourites, and it's a must buy if you like puzzle games. I enjoyed it immensely even though it's a very short game. The physics are great, the graphics and audio are perfect for the game (although it doesn't have music) and I felt like a curious child playing it. I wish there was an option to create your own levels so you could play it over more though.+ Fun puzzles (not too hard or too easy)+ Great Physics+ Nice sound effects+ Visually appealing- Short game- No replayability valueHint: Game's only over at the EИD.

Some “puzzles” you can only solve by clicking on different objects until you somehow solve it. It definitely was worth the money for me but if you prefer to get a lot of content for your money you should probably wait until the next sale. Would recommend buying the game for tablets though.

No shooting.  Just thinking.  It's a very well executed game.  If you like hundreds of hours of gameplay or games with a lot fo replayability, this is not the game for you.

												Windosill is a Flash game that was released in 2009 and then later ported onto smartphone. You can say that it's point'n'click adventure, but actually it's a short toybox, so to say. You can check out demo at Windosill site, which is half of  a game.Now, game only has 10 or so rooms (screens). Objective of which is to find a cube to unlock door and get wagon through door. Puzzles aren't compilated or hardcore and game will take maximum half-hour to beat with no real replaybility.And I probably should not recommend this game due to being so short and not gamey, but it's a little curiousity. A toy box. Using mouse, you get to interact with various objects. Game is quite calming experience, yet not complete bore. There is no music, just simple sounds. I also found animation and physics quite impressive for Flash game, lovely. Most memoriable screen was room with three creatures, each one taking interest in interacting with your toy wagon.Still no idea to who I can recommend this at all, but it's a little curious thing.

												This would have to be one of the most elegant games that I have played. The game doesn't explain anything, but it's easy enough for you to work out what your goal is and with each new room there is a distinct puzzle that you have to solve to achieve it. I found each room to be quite visually calming which was an interesting contrast with the short periods of frustration trying to solve some of the puzzles.It's not a long game but it is a good game, and in my opinion it's most certainly worth the small asking price.

												I absolutely loved this game. It's a refreshingly simple and beautiful game about a little blue train that dares to journey from its place on the shelf. In each room it enters, it must somehow find a cube used to open the door to the next room. The puzzles make you think very creatively, doing things you don't normally do in a game. The graphics and art are gorgeous and you can tell the developer has paid attention to every tiny detail, because almost every object can be clicked and interacted with. The first time I did it, it took roughly an hour, and it has good replayability because you can time yourself and try to beat your best time. Overall, I enjoyed Windosill very much, and for the price (especially if you buy it from the Humble Store for $.99), you can't go wrong.			",20,8,0,2,3,0,3

												This is just the neatest little game. Well, it's barely a game. But it's so neat. In such a short time there's a wonderful display of creativity on display from the developers, and simple but interesting puzzles to go along with it. Shame that it's so short, but for the time you play it I can't help but think you'd enjoy yourself. Probably best to only pick up on sale, though, even with its small price tag.

												Very short, but very unique puzzle game. There's only 10 puzzles, each in its own environment (world, if you will). The thing that really thrilled me the most was the visual presentation. You can finish it in anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes, but that's about the maximum you'll get out of it. Still, it's all about the experience, and ""Windosill"" offers truly something different.

												Windosill is a game in which pure exploration and aesthetic beauty excels. Even though this game runs about 40 minutes and is played through Adobe Flash, it's beyond gorgeous and very fun. While costing $3, it's definitely worth it to play through again once or twice for the aesthetic pleasure and art style.8.9/10			",113,18,2,20,9,0,13

												This game made me giggle like a maniac!It's very short - it took me an hour to finish and I kind of suck at games - but it's extremely cute and utterly charming. Each level centres around finding a small box, using it to open a door, and getting your little toy train character through the door. Playing levels mainly goes like this:""Ah what a pretty place! Let me just poke some things and see what they do.""""Heehee that's adorable. <3""""Okay let's do the puzzle.""""I don't understand the puzzle!""""Ah okay that's how you do it. Let's poke some more things!""""I've poked everything there is to poke. Onwards!""If you like colourful, fairly simplistic puzzles and enjoy playing with your environment, then you might like this game. It really benefits from not being too fussed about finishing the level in record time or whatever, but being more interested in looking around and enjoying yourself, while incidentally progressing from level to level.

												This would have to be one of the most elegant games that I have played. The game doesn't explain anything, but it's easy enough for you to work out what your goal is and with each new room there is a distinct puzzle that you have to solve to achieve it. I found each room to be quite visually calming which was an interesting contrast with the short periods of frustration trying to solve some of the puzzles.It's not a long game but it is a good game, and in my opinion it's most certainly worth the small asking price.

Beautiful and calming, going through the levels of this game is magical and entrancing, and takes you away from life and the mundane for a brief time. Thoroughly enjoyable, this game will give you a good 40 minute break from life and stress-inducing competitive games to explore strange landscapes, creatures and objects.This game will not be for everyone, but I for one thoroughly enjoyed it.

												The oniric travel of a toy vehicle towards finding his own place among the stars. Ten puzzle sceneries constitute its adventure. They are very original, inspiring and beautifully designed. Difficulty is ok, never impossible but sufficient to engage you and amaze you in the end of every puzzle, when the magic mechanics of these worlds suddenly come to light. Despite the game is a little jewel for what it is, it actually deserved more levels. I recommend it, but take into account that you will not play for more than 40-60 minutes.  7+/10			",109,90,0,8,5,3,12

												This is a short game (less than 45 minutes of gameplay), but it is bursting with creativity and charm.  You will have just as much fun clicking on all the random extras in the levels as you will trying to solve the puzzles.The challenges are fairly straightforward, incorporating skills such as pattern recognition, memory, and sequential task management.  There are no instructions; the puzzles are intuitive, and rely on your sense of play and exploration to uncover the clues to solve each level.  Gameplay is entirely mouse-based (clicking, clicking and dragging, clicking and holding, etc.).While there is not much replay value for adults, I feel this would be a great learning game for kids, encouraging them to think outside the box.Overall, I would give this game an 8.5/10			",25,124,0,16,6,0,8

A very nice (but again, very short) puzzle game.

												The oniric travel of a toy vehicle towards finding his own place among the stars. Ten puzzle sceneries constitute its adventure. They are very original, inspiring and beautifully designed. Difficulty is ok, never impossible but sufficient to engage you and amaze you in the end of every puzzle, when the magic mechanics of these worlds suddenly come to light. Despite the game is a little jewel for what it is, it actually deserved more levels. I recommend it, but take into account that you will not play for more than 40-60 minutes.  7+/10			",109,90,0,8,5,3,12

												Windosill exemplifies the spirit of the traveller, willing to lose themselves without question in a journey without destination. It's a frivolous toy, the kind of thing I can neither justify nor explain... I  just love how it feels, down to the tiniest detail. Vectorpark must surely have procured the blueprints to my brain.

												Very cute. Even though it's very short, it's still very well made. The art is beautiful, the sounds are great, and the puzzles are hard enough to be challenging. It's definitally a winner! I say 10/10 for this game.My only consern is that there is no sequel to this game. Sure the ending is great but then your stuck there at your computer thinking: ""Is that it???"" All I'm saying is that it could use some more levels or something.			",33,7,1,12,10,0,1

I can really recommend it, even though you are done with it after 30 minutes. I play it once in a while again, though. So for what it is, I am really going to give it a 10/10. It's unique and fun and a nice calming game. Those 10/10 are of course not comparable with a not-puzzle game, of course.			",787,255,33,85,79,10,118

												That game was way more playful and challenging than I expected. I loved the short interactive world that was created in this game and while I did find solving the puzzles quite challenging (especially since things needed to happen in a certain order) it was really rewarding to finish the game and find the end! Highly recommended if you're into puzzle games. Occasionally I found my coordination lacking when trying to do a task or move my mouse pointer, but otherwise it was a great game! :)			",44,19,0,7,6,1,9

I enjoyed it immensely even though it's a very short game. The physics are great, the graphics and audio are perfect for the game (although it doesn't have music) and I felt like a curious child playing it. I wish there was an option to create your own levels so you could play it over more though.+ Fun puzzles (not too hard or too easy)+ Great Physics+ Nice sound effects+ Visually appealing- Short game- No replayability valueHint: Game's only over at the EИD.

												Very short but lovely designed puzzle game. Takes about 20-30 minutes to beat. The levels are interesting but not very logical. Some “puzzles” you can only solve by clicking on different objects until you somehow solve it. It definitely was worth the money for me but if you prefer to get a lot of content for your money you should probably wait until the next sale. Would recommend buying the game for tablets though.
