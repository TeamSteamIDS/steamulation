												The first game was unique and so original, you would think they wouldn't be able to make it any better, but they did in this excellent sequel. When you think of Telltale point&click games you'd probably have The Walking Dead or another newer one. They're good and all but they don't match the amount of atmosphere this game has, (even without the 'choose your own path' feature) and it only lasts around 4-5 hours to complete! Aside from the short play time and (fairly) closed and slightly random ending, this game is a must buy.9.5/10			",82,12,0,4,7,0,3

 What looks like a children's book is actually a dark story punctuated by challenging puzzles (and sometimes vice-versa). Puzzle Agent takes place in the morose corners of the Midwest. Sure it's a clichè setting for mystery thrillers, but how this setting is expressed in a ""children's book"" art form turns that clichè into an interesting contrast. Graham Annable's art profoundly brings the story to life, and what a strange story it is. I say that in a good way.The main gameplay draw in Puzzle Agent are obviously the puzzles, which are interspersed throughout the game as the story unfolds. The formula is basically narrative-puzzle-narrative-puzzle-narrative reminiscent of the Professor Layton games for the Nintendo DS. No, Puzzle Agent is not a Professor Layton rip off. Both titles are really just video game versions of puzzle story books that anyone born before 1990 grew up with. Also, although this is a Telltale game, this is not really a point-and-click adventure since there are no branching paths. Just keep on clicking the next obvious thing to progress the story.There are a good variety of puzzles ranging from logic to spatial reasoning. I would say just over half of the puzzles offer a solid challenge for the average Joe. The puzzles that are easy are indeed the weakest aspect of this game, but they're so easy that it can literally take 10 seconds to finish them, getting you straight back into the intriguing narrative or better puzzles. It only gets frustrating when an easy puzzle is a slight variation of a previous one. The game could seriously use less of those rotating tiles, piece fitting and pathfinding puzzles which often can be solved by simple brute force. The piece fitting puzzles in particular are somewhat broken because the pieces automatically latch onto the correct position when in close proximity thereby essentially solving itself for you.I do like how a few puzzles meld with the narrative. At certain plot points, the game interrupts you midway through solving a puzzle with an animation happening on the puzzle pieces directly, momentarily bringing you back into the story. In one part, someone off-screen steals a puzzle piece while you solve that puzzle. You can't experience narrative like this in puzzle story books. Here Telltale have shown us an example of what they do best: how they can transform traditional forms of media into a better experience through new technologies. I just wish there were more moments like these.The one other issue I had with a few of the puzzles is that sometimes the rules are vague. For example, one puzzle asked you to determine the winner of a tournament with nothing more than statements made by the contestants. However, the format of the tournament was never mentioned (spoiler alert: it's single-elimination). Another involves fish and food chains, but it was never clear what eats what and whether there can be a fish within a fish within a fish... ya know, fishception. There are 72 puzzles (37 in Puzzle Agent 1 and 35 in 2) and I counted no more than 5 that suffered from ambiguity or outright misses necessary information to be solvable. It's a small percentage so I don't think it's that big of a deal. It just sucks when a brilliant puzzle was spoiled because the rules weren't crystal clear.Overall, I enjoyed Puzzle Agent's story, art and most of the puzzles. Also, you should know that this review covers Puzzle Agent 1 and 2 since they are each half a game and half a story. Telltale really should've called them Episode 1 and 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Puzzle Agent 2 is a game marred by plot inconsistencies and an unsatisfying story. While the characters and atmosphere pull the player in, the gameplay and story problems are overwhelming.After competing Puzzle Agent 1, I was excited to play the sequel. Unfortunately, this game doesn't hold up. The story has suffered, as the overloaded plot crashes and burns in a chaotic confusion, leaving plothole debris everywhere. A list of which includes: Agent Tethers keeps his job at the FBI despite returning to a case without authorization; breaking and entering into the local police department; tampering with government evidence; assaulting another government agent; espousing conspiracy theories to his superior; and stealing and destroying government property.Mrs. Garrett did not want someone to know that Tethers was staying at her inn, but we never find out who or why.It is never revealed what happened to all the missing people in Scoggins, because...It is never established whether the astronauts are murdering the missing people or if this was another wild goose chase. Since there have been a few false leads in both games, intentional to the plot, there is no way to know. This leads to another problem for the story: If the astronauts aren't murdering people,  what's causing the disappearances? If the astronauts are murdering people, why didn't they murder Tethers when they cornered him and injected him with something to make him fall asleep?It is never revealed what happened to the astronauts aside from Isaac.Why did the astronauts remain in the forest for 16 years?What are the Hidden People? Where was their home? What was their home?Why did Glori and Isaac agree to go the Brotherhood if he was disturbed, when he never appeared to be disturbed?Did the government know the space lander was in Scoggins since the first game? If they did, then why did they wait until Tethers sent back tapes in the second game to go there? If they didn't, why didn't they let Tethers finish the case is Scoggins the first time around? Why did they let Tethers stay in Scoggins after they found out he was there investigating a case off-duty?This is a minor point, but Agent Tethers never draws his gun once in this game, even when his life is in danger. In the last game, I believe he uses it only once, and he misses. For some reason, the game's title card on Steam shows him drawing a gun. Again, I know this is a minor point, but why give him a gun if he never uses it? Especially since it's so easy to write in a reason he doesn't use one; He's an office agent in the Puzzle Research Division who almost never goes on field missions. There's even less of a reason for him to have a gun this time since he's not even on offical busniess. It just shows a lack of thought in the writing.The list goes on. This is totally unacceptable and unprofessional story-writing. You can beat the game in under 2 hours (I've played the game a couple times to get all the achievements) and the number of plot-holes is unbelieveable. Why else would a game so short have a plot explanation on Wikipedia that's as long as a PhD dissertation?I've heard great things about Telltale's more recent work, but there's still no excuse because Puzzle Agent 1 was satisfying as far as story goes. Yes, there were loose ends and mysteries at the conclusion, but the main goals were achieved and the mysteries were largely related to things out of Tether's control the whole time: He couldn't understand this odd little town, and he never would. It was over his head, and he caught a glimpse of something greater than he could ever imagine. The player is left intrigued. In Puzzle Agent 2, parts of the mystery are revealed and simply make no sense, leaving the player very frustrated.The biggest problem with the first game were that the puzzles were inconsistent in difficulty and clarity. Here, it seems the difficulty has been smoothed out a bit, but they have lost variety and at times still have difficult to interpret rules. The biggest problem I had was that the puzzles had little to do with the story and actually broke the pace.Not to say I disliked everything. Sheriff Bahg was my favorite antagonist from the first game, and his condescending skepticism of the meek FBI man Tethers is always so well-played. The voice acting for Bahg is excellent. The atmosphere in the game also retains it's X-files allure, and Tethers searching for clues is still exciting. Korka was an interesting new character, and she gave the story some funny payoff and comedy relief. I always liked Tethers as a character; he's an excellent straightman in a world full of insane people. He also always has this idiotic confused look on his face that's actually pretty endearing.ACHIEVEMENTS: Since this is a point-and-click adventure game, this is pretty hard to screw up, but Telltale pulled it off. One achievement requires a perfect run of all puzzles in the game. Even if you beat the game with one failed attempt at one puzzle and go back to that puzzle after the conclusion of the story, it doesn't matter. You have to open a new file and play the entire game over and do everything perfectly. Kind of a waste of time.Overall, the game is atmospheric, exciting and well-acted, but the gameplay and story problems are too great for these high points to overcome. Not recommended unless heavily discounted, you have played the prequel, and are looking for achievements.			",176,46,3,12,14,4,24

												Puzzle Agent 2 is a puzzle game woven in the middle of a interesting storyline.  It's unfortunate that the game has not added more to it than the original offered other than more puzzles.  However, it's fortunate that they didn't break anything that did work from the original game and simply just offered new puzzles.  No risks taken here, if you've played the original, then you know exactly what to expect for this sequel.  Again, the only drawback for this game is the fact that it is so short.  Overall good quality game with some good puzzles to tease the brain.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												Overall I enjoyed the first game more, but this one was still fun in it's own right. I got it on sale for $2.50 so for that price I definitely recommend it. Just wait for it to go on sale before buying it. Oh, and I 100% it in about 2 hours, puzzles included. Take that for what you will.I'm just going to bullet point the things I have to say.- Excellent tone and theming, very reminiscent of Fargo- Story is not too interesting but it works for what it is, dialogue can be funny at times- Interesting characters and a fairly engaging world- Playing the first game isn't required, there's enough exposition to keep you up to speed-Art style is really cool, some of the composition and art direction is phenominal-Looks fairly low resolution-Music is awesome, main theme is great and all songs compliment scenes well- Gameplay is very linear, no reward for exploring, game solves mystery for you and you're just along for the ride - Absolutely no difficulty curve, the last puzzles in the game are just as easy if not easier than ones at the beginning- Difficulty all over the place, some puzzles are ridiculously easy and some seem like they make no sense at all- That being said, average puzzle is pretty fun. Not too hard that it's stupid but not too easy. Just the right difficulty to give you that 'aha!' feeling- Ton of sliding puzzles for some reason			",323,103,24,30,21,4,29

												While Puzzle Agent 1 had quite a few simple puzzles, Puzzle Agent 2 is significantly simpler in its puzzle design and provides almost no challenge whatsoever. It is almost like a rehash of a lot of the easy puzzles from the first game.In fact, this is my biggest gripe with the game: a lot of the puzzles feel like simple variations of the puzzles in Puzzle Agent 1. While this is not true for all the puzzles, I can't help but feel this is a lazy follow-up game. A lot of the same characters and locations are re-used, and even the story becomes rushed and unfinished at the end. It *does* conclude - unlike Puzzle Agent 1 - however so much is either glossed over or ignored that it's just not the satisfying ending that you'd want. Get Puzzle Agent 2 *only* if you have a burning desire to finish the story started in Puzzle Agent 1. Otherwise, I would recommend skipping it unless you can get both games together for cheap.2 out of 5 foxes.			",252,85,5,23,8,4,11

												If you are looking for a game with a fun and quirky story, in addition to interesting characters, this game fits the bill. If you are looking for a game with enjoyable puzzles, the first Puzzle Agent is great and a real bargain. But if you enjoyed the puzzles in the first Puzzle Agent, you may be sorely disappointed with this continuation of the game. Unlike the first game, many of the puzzles lacked proper descriptions, forcing the player to make guesses on the rules of certain puzzles. Some even required previous knowledge, which may cause some puzzlers to break from the immersion of the game to go to the internet. While the first Puzzle Agent relied more on logical and 'puzzle' puzzles, this game tended to use more visual puzzles without much logic at all. But if you try not to care about the puzzles, and ignore the visual and gameplay bugs (infinite gum!), you might enjoy what you see.			",208,53,0,19,6,2,25

The 52!

												Puzzle Agent 2 is a great game that provides a humorous story littered with puzzles that range from too easy, to downright ridiculous. It is a fairly short game (roughly about 2 hours), but some of the puzzles will keep anyone busier than they wish. The only downside to this adventure is the inconsistent level of difficulty in some of the puzzles.  The ""Arrow / Pause"" puzzles for example can be too complicated for its own good, while others may be too abstract to make any sense without hints or walkthroughs. Still, PA2 provides plenty of brain exercises and laughs for any older gamer to enjoy. Recommend!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My memory may be fuzzy but, number 1 seemed longer, more engaging and satisfying overall. This doesn't have the same eerie vibe exploring the town and finding out more about the story, more like a short wrap up to all the unanswered questions left in the original. Even the puzzles in the original seemed better as they didn't go out of the game context to reference outside information that the game expects you to know. (Hint: Binary number system, and PI's digits. Great if you know them, but frustrating when it doesn't give you any context for number sequence puzzles. The original Puzzle Agent I still recommend playing as a good example of a story driven adventure/puzzle game that manages to convey fear and suspense. But this with its explanations for the mysterious kills the magic that made the first one a gem.			",264,52,5,16,12,0,20

Given it's cliffhanger ending and complete lack of closure it was inevitable that a sequel would eventually emerge, and thus we are presented with Puzzle Agent 2, a direct continuation of Nelson Tether's previous escapades in the odd little town of Scoggins and a fitting end to the story that was begun in the last game.Although it's marketed as a full sequel, PA2 is far more akin to a second episode, which is fairly typical of Telltale. It ties directly into the ending of the original game, tying up loose ends and finally shedding a light on what happened to Issac Davidson, what have Nelson's visions been about, and who the heck are the hidden people. While many of the revelations are absolutely absurd taken in context with the rest the series they don't feel at all out of place, instead just one more bizarre happening in the day to day occurrences of a puzzle agent. I was very pleased to finally get some answers for the many questions that had previously been asked, and in the end everything tied up quite nicely (or as nicely as anything this unusual could).Gameplay is identical to the original game, mixing Professor Layton-like puzzles with the Twin Peaks-esq setting and dialog to great effect. The puzzles are a bit fewer in number this time, but as a whole they are better designed and effectively tied into the story than before. Many characters return, with better writing and voice acting while still retaining the original off-kilter charm that made them what they are. I never did adjust to the stilted animation style, but like everything else has a unique appeal to it that works with the rest of the game.If I had any problem with the game it's that it's short, shorter than it's predecessor, and yet costs twice the price. I couldn't say that the quality of either of the two games is far apart (I think both are excellent for what they are), but at double the cost of admission with less content, it's hard for me to recommend purchasing PA2 at least outright, and would definitely advise waiting for a sale.Other than the length, Puzzle Agent 2 is a treat for fans of the original. You're getting more of the same, and that's a good thing as so far there isn't anything else like the series available on Steam. Playing the first game should definitely be considered a prerequisite, and if you didn't like it then this won't change your mind. For those wanting for more this is a worthy sequel who's biggest flaw is actually being called one. Think of it instead as Puzzle Agent: Part 2 and you're unlikely to come away disappointed.

												It's not as good as the first game and the story was taken to an unnecessary level of confusion, but it's still good. This needs a sequel!

												Just as solid as the first game. Not a great game but fun to play for about 3 to 4 hours. Continuss the story from the first game and has the same concept but the puzzles are better this time. But it's a sequel so there is no use of playing it without finishing the first game.

Short version: 74%Puzzle Agent 2 is a decent title by itself, but it is mainly recommended for those who played the first game. They not only can watch the rest of the story, but can enjoy the increased puzzle difficulty.Long version:A typical sequel usually does nothing but brings you more of the defining elements of the first instalment. Puzzle Agent 2 is no exception.The artwork is yet again based on Graham Annable’s Grickle series, but one of the defining elements, the eerie small town mystery is quickly abolished by the new plot, leading into an overcomplicated government conspiracy thriller that in the end just cracks under its own weight.The puzzles received a large overhaul. There is no more ambiguity, and the number of 5-second riddles have been reduced considerably to give room for more difficult and more computer game-like types. There is also a new incentive system for replay value: you can only access the final enigma if you successfully complete all puzzles without hints or wrong answers, a feat which is nearly impossible on the first try without a walkthrough.Thanks to these simple design improvements Puzzle Agent 2 is a little more fun to play than the first game, especially for returning players.

												This was a great game. Better than the first one. If you like the Layton series, you will definitely enjoy this one. The story was legitimately compelling, and even had a few comical moments thrown in. While the puzzles aren't as hard to solve as in the Prof. Layton games, they are still enjoyable. This is also a great buy if you are running a netbook or low-end pc. Do yourself a favor and pick it up!			",241,52,1,34,6,2,15

												It's not quite as good as part 1 in almost all aspects. The puzzles are mostly fine, safe for some frustratingly stupid number puzzles that lack a proper setup to be solvable without flaw. The graphics and voice over are the same as part 1 with some additions.The plot is... a mess really. What starts out as a missing persons case turns into several wild goose chases that ultimately lead nowhere and have barely any consequences or closure in the end.Enjoyable, but just barely recommendable.

												This review is really simple - just refer to my review of Puzzle Agent 1. PA2 is essentially the same exact game (same engine, same characters, same setting, same types of puzzles). The main thing this one brings to the table is a continuation of the absurd story that began in part 1. So if you enjoyed the first game and/or just want to see how the story ends, then by all means, go ahead and pick up PA2. However, be warned - the puzzles aren't terribly brillaint or clever, and for the most part (as in PA1), the solutions are ridiculously easy. On only a few occasions will you be truly stumped for more than a few minutes, and that will likely be due to the instructions not being clear enough. Although, oddly, there are a couple of harder optional puzzles that require a more-than-casual familiarity with mathematics (which I felt was a bit strange). But aside from that, anyone should be able to solve the main puzzles required to complete the game. All in all, it's a fun, short game.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												I can't quite recommend the 2nd Puzzle Agent game as highly as the first. The puzzles were a major disappointment. Most of the puzzles felt extremely repetitive, which is quite odd in a game where the puzzles are not bound by any limitations (with the exception of the developer's creativity). It's still a very short game and can be blown through in a couple of hours, and I suppose it might be worth going through if you're curious as to how the story ends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Puzzle Agent 2 takes you back to Scoggins to try to find out about the Hidden People and missing persons. It has the same art style and gameplay mechanics as the first game. However, this game's puzzles are a lot better. No puzzle was hard to understand and there seemed to be more of a variety in puzzle types. There were a few sliding block puzzles this time around, but they weren't too intimidating. Also, there was only one puzzle that was simplified by locking draggable items into the right place (compared to the first game, which had a lot more).The story is completely odd from start to finish (like, WAY out there) . If you thought Layton plot twists were bad, this whole game is one. It's not /bad/ (in fact, I thought it was interesting), but if you're looking for a story that makes sense, you won't find it here.I've completed the game in a little over 5 hours with help of several people in stream, but I'm sure I wouldn't've passed 6 hours on my own. Where Puzzle Agent 1 had a better story, Puzzle Agent 2 has better puzzles. I'd recommend picking them up when they're on sale.			",208,80,4,20,14,4,21

												This is a step back from Puzzle Agent 1. While it still kept the original aspect and feel of the game, it was worse in almost every other way: heavy reuse of assets, low variation in puzzles which had clunky explanations and a story which lacks intensity and has a lot of loose ends. Play Puzzle Agent 1. If you want more of the same but done on a lower level of quality, try PA2 as well but I would not recommend it as a stand alone.			",175,67,4,23,20,2,28

												Like the original Puzzle Agent game, I thought this was enjoyable -- not too long (a few hours is probably enough to finish it), but with enough puzzles to keep things interesting.  Tthe puzzles weren't too difficult to solve and the story, which is amusing, helps connect them.  Since it doesn't take a lot of time to complete, I think this game is worth playing if you generally like puzzles.  Hopefully there will be a Puzzle Agent 3 in the future.

												Just like the first game this is a story driven detective puzzle game with cute cartoon graphics, good writing and a sense of humour (along the same lines as professor layton on the DS but not as long or as polished).The puzzles are varied and interesting but very similar to the first game. So they may feel repetitive if you play the two games back to back. Again it is a pretty short game, but it is engaging and hard to put down once you start. I enjoyed playing through this game and would recommend it if you like puzzles. It was good to continue the story and get some answers after the first game. My disappointment with this game was the minor bugs. I would often look at the next puzzle and then quit out. In one case this meant the puzzle did not reset and so I could not complete the puzzle without looking the solution up. It also meant that I failed to get a dozen achievements during my play through. There was also a few minor graphical bugs.			",706,300,18,107,68,8,113

												I got this game because I wanted to see how the story developed from the first game. I'm quite dissapointed, the feel-good feeling rom the first game isn't quite there anymore and the story gets a little bit to weird. The puzzles are still a bit to easy and probably more suited to younger children. What annoys me even more is that to be able to get the last 2 achivements you have to solve all the earlier puzzles without guessing wrong once ore using any clues. If you, like me used a hint once you're screwed if you want to achieve that perfect score. If you just want to see how the story develops I recommend you just to watch a youtube clip or read.

 Story: Puzzle Agent 2, the second game if you did not get that. As the first game tells us, you are in a village/town/outskirt called Scoogins, where an accident has occured in a eraser factory. This eraser factory was the only thing Scoogins could make money on, since the lack tourism. This factory also did erasers for The United States of America's president (unknown president in this lore), which means that if they do not get in to the factory and get it working again, they will lose their income and bad♥♥♥♥♥♥will happen. That is easier said than done. Anyhow, that is Puzzle Agent, not Puzzle Agent 2. As you solve the Scoogins mystery, you decide to return back to Scoogins and get more answers (Play Puzzle Agent to understand). The game contains great puzzles, fantastic artwork (my personal taste) and some good fun. The puzzles makes you actually use your brain for once, since most of the games is one click and wasd to score, whilst in Puzzle Agent, the puzzles will reward you for solving them (with mental honour).Mechanics:The mechanics is still there, point and click, and for every puzzle you decide that you have the correct anwer, you will see how much tax money you will use up (The less, better score). If you solve the puzzle you will get a ranking and som gum (used for hints). If you answer incorrect, you will have to retry or leave the puzzle (Not every puzzle is needed to complete the story, but is highly recommended to atleast try.) and also spend more tax money. Pros&Cons:I love the story and how it progresses, the first game actually got me jump at times, because the red ugly looking gnomes will freak the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. The only downside is the loading screens, they tend to be either slow or fast. Also the sound of voices is a little bit roughed up, so it makes it sound horrible at times.Rating:Other than that the game series is great, and is a total must buy if you get bored of the wasd click games as I call them. Puzzle Agent 2 gets a 9/10 ",373,57,13,45,35,2,38

All that's really new here are harder puzzles, remixes of puzzles seen in the first Puzzle Agent, and the answers to the unsolved mysteries of the first Puzzle Agent.Again, I can't talk about the plot of Puzzle Agent 2 without spoiling anything as everything kicks off right from the getgo. What I will say, however, is that all of the mystery and eeriness is completely thrown out the window as the plot, even though it starts out strong, ends very weakly. Do I recommend buying Puzzle Agent 2? Yes, but only if you're really desperate for answers that weren't given at the end of the first Puzzle Agent. You're really not missing out on much, and it would have been best if the mysteries in the first Puzzle Agent were left unsolved and open-ended. For NZD$11.99, I'd wait for a sale for when this game is $2 - $3 before buying it.			",169,15,3,28,10,3,26

												Great sequel to a great first game. At first I thought it would contain the exact same locations from the first game, but it seems I was partially wrong. You do visit old locations, but new ones as well. The story is a bit more developed it seems, and most of the puzzles are now connected to the story instead of being somewhat random. But the game is still over too quickly, and the puzzles seem easier. And yes, there are still hidden puzzles to be found, so don't worry. The graphics are the same as well (which isn't a bad thing at all; I loved the graphics). Same goes for the voice overs. Now, let's wait for Puzzle Agent 3 (I want more !).[Rating: 90/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Short and sweet. My personal experience was that many of the puzzles were a breeze while just a few managed to stump me  (yet having a solution that seemed obvious in retrospect).Honestly though I would have enjoyed it even if all of the puzzles had been too easy, simply because it was like watching a 3-hour long Grickle animation. Not familiar with Grickle? Proceed to google and or youtube immediately.			",201,55,1,27,15,2,16

												LD;DRThis is one game; not two.  You should get it if you can get both games for less than five dollars.Pros- The videos will give you a feel for the game.  It is an interesting, slow paced game that has a twist here and there.- Humor is sprinkled into the game.- Getting your pen and paper out is satisfying for some of the puzzles.- The fact it costs the taxpayer so much per puzzle is both funny and realistic.- There is a resolution to the second game but there could be more (the right way to end the story).- The premise for the game is hilarious because it's realisitic.Cons- A third or more of the puzzles are completely throw away.- The first game is NOT COMPLETE.  37 puzzles and half a story is not a full game.- the second game is NOT COMPLETE 34 puzzles aand half a story is not a full game.- There should be a better way to make sure you get all the puzzles before leaving a scene.- They should cut off dialogue options that you've already heard (you can talk to the same person again and on it will repeat when they're done but that means you'll have to repeat dialogue at least once per person per situation to make sure you hear everything they have to say.)Tips- Always look carefully at the images behind numbers or other puzzles, they can provide clues.

												A follow up to Puzzle Agent that is even weirder than the original. I didn't think it could get any weirder. The game picks up from the end of the last game, and it primarily takes place in the same town. Any puzzle adventure fan will like this game. The puzzle difficulty was medium. Hard enough to make you think, but easy enough to not get frustrated.The length was around the same as the first, maybe a little longer (expect 3-4 hours).

												Recycles a lot of puzzles from the first game (which were repetitive then), which gets tiring. If you've played both, you've played enough bouncing lasers/rocks/skidoos around for a lifetime. There's also some unfortunate ableist stuff going on in the last third or so. The art style is fantastic though, and the humor is often on point. The ending is REALLY abrupt though, and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I'd recommend the first one over this one.

												It's a sequel so more developed than the first, but still some solutions are so arbitrary you just have to guess until you hit on the one the game wants. The frustration more than outweighs the fun on these occasions.Also, the further in the game you get the more the puzzles repeat themselves, until a few that require knowledge that has nothing to do with the game or the situation the main character is in.I recommended the first despite the short length, the same random solution problem, and the lack of an ending that forced you to buy this one, so in the face of that I am not going to recommend this game. If you get it for super-cheap it's worth the playthrough, but I don't suggest you pay full price or buy it based on its own merits.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They told me I solved the Scoggins case. They told me my job was done. They were wrong. I saw Isaac Davner being dragged away. But the factory was running again, so I was done.All the puzzles I was handed since felt lacking, gum always tasted stale. Like a maze with no exit, something was amiss. I couldn't take it anymore.I took some time off, a nice vacation. Booked a passage west. Where there's snow. Where there's a lodge. Where I left something unfinished.When I got there, it's was as if I had never left. Everything was still wrapped in puzzles, the whole town a huge question mark. It was almost as if I was in a Professor Layton game. Funny as hell, it was the most horrible thing I could think of.The town greeted me with the warmth of a cold morning. Monosyllables and riddles, shoos and puzzles, lots of ABC gum. But the answers were clear: more missing people. All lost in the woods. Just like Isaac.I could tell that, while everything looked the same, everything was different. There was a sense of urgency about the people. Folks who made little to no sense before had now lost all but one of their marbles. Something was going to happen soon.I'm still not sure I believe what I saw in the woods. The Hidden People are just a bad fairytale, like the boogeyman or the shockmaster.I have to solve this mystery. Scoggins may very well depend on it. My life certainly does.I just hope I can stay sane long enough to do so.			",444,138,21,68,26,6,86

Scoggins here we come back! The plot is better than the first game, there are more puzzles even though some of them are very trivial to solve. This ""second chapter"" of Puzzle Agent is long as much as the first one, about 3 or 4 hours at best.

												This game is a puzzle-based mystery, not much else to it. The puzzles are good, but the most ocmpeling part was the story.  For the first game, it was really good, I enjoyed it. In both games, the atmosphere is very creepy and felt like somehting big was going on. The gnomes are genuinely terrifying, but the big problem comes in the second game (no spoilers). The truth is, the ending is not conclusive, the mystery isn't really solved, all the clues we found and all the mystery leads to a very inconclusive ending. The puzzles are good in both games, the suspense for a while is good, but when you start uncovering government conspiracies it takes a turn for the worse. I am sad to have to rate this game down, because I thuroughgly enjoyed it, but I am very dissapointed in the ending.			",115,16,0,1,15,1,14

												Yeah... I wasn't a huge fan of the first, and this is worse in every way.A list of downgrades:1. Plot goes from passable and intriguing in the first game to a haphazard string of non-sequiturs in this game and still leaves a lot of loose threads, despite supposedly finishing the storyline.2. About half the puzzles are a rehash of puzzles from the first game, which were already a bit repetitive to begin with, and a lot of the new puzzles are really easy. The developers discovered slider puzzles so those are all over the place. I guess, the instructions feel overall a bit better here though.3. Shorter length. Only 34 total puzzles here and there's a few puzzle-gauntlet strings with little plot so the end result is a shorter runtime overall, despite this game costing double the previous.4. Nothing's been upgraded aesthetically, the game's full of reused assets and the interface is completely identical. 5. Characters act inconsistent here for no apparent reason. The sheriff and Korka most notably.Basically, take the first game, strip away any charm, rush out a sequel, and you get... this. Not like it's a horrible game but, noooo way is it worth its asking price.Oh yeah and good job making players replay the entire game if they screw up a single puzzle on the first try if you want to unlock the last puzzle, that's -always- appreciated... e.e			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												I picked this game together with Puzzle Agent 1 during the Wintersale, but couldn't play it until now.The game was really funny, the puzzles ranges from easy to hard, you have to think or not, sometimes you find the solution immediately and the next one is giving you a headache.If you are stuck, you can pick up gum all around Scoggins, you can use them for hints.The story itself was also funny, crazy characters, a weird town, Agent Thethers himself working in the FBI Puzzle Department, the crazy Koshka and so on, i really had to laugh out loud very often.The game was more or less short, but this is irrelevant because it depends on how often you play such games.After all i would really appreciate it when Telltale Games will give me Part 3 someday.

												Puzzles rely more on thinking 'outside the box' than on solving with information given. An early example is a number sequence puzzle that provides the numbers 11, 12, 1, and 2, and challenges the player to work out the next number. Multiple potential patterns present themselves, but none of them are relevant; the game intends for the player to guess that they must be talking about clocks, and assume that the 12-1 portion of the sequence is a reset of the pattern, none of which is information that can be presented or discovered ingame in any way. Thus, like many of the game's puzzles, it's impossible to appropriately solve without using the built-in help system or by simply guessing.Another good example is the coinbox puzzle, which attempts to utilize binary, but does so incorrectly. That puzzle is literally not possible to solve properly because its understanding of binary is incorrect, or perhaps the solution was coded wrong. The 'correct' answer is a mirrored version of what the actual binary values should read, though there's no indication that the answer is mirrored, leaving the player to guess and check. Either way, it's another ready example of puzzles that are ill-planned and expect the player to guess or to have outside help.This might be the right puzzle game for people who like to be stuck only to learn that the solution was hidden in information they never had access to. Probably great fun for people who like riddles that can't be solved with the data provided. Not a good one for puzzle solvers who expect cleverly presented clues and solid logic, none of that will be found here.			",169,49,2,37,23,1,49

												It's not uncommon for video game sequels to learn from the mistakes of the originals and improve on them. I was hoping Puzzle Agent 2 would follow in that honorable tradition. It did not. While not REALLY that much worse than the original (which I gave a general thumbs-up), it has certainly taken a couple of steps backward. The games' crayon-drawn style and sleepy setting were risky, but the first game succeeded in making them seem fresh and charming. In the sequel, the pacing is allowed to lag even more, and in order to follow up on the incomplete ""Hidden People"" storyline, it brings us back to the exact same town, with mostly the exact same characters, and even some of the same puzzles. In fact, the whole thing just feels like the second act of the same game; the experiences are mostly redundant.But the big problem is that, the puzzles, the crux and namesake of these games, are simply poor. The original had a clear progression in difficulty, with the few exceptions sprinkled so as to have an alleviating effect. In PA2, it's all over the place. Worse is that many of the puzzles AREN'T EVEN PUZZLES. One of them (spoiler alert, I guess) literally just wants you to recognize the digits of pi and supply the eighth and ninth digits after the decimal, you know, because we've all memorized it past the first two. The whole game, in fact, is so inconsistent that it never feels like it was ever going to be cohesive in the first place.And the storyline is no better. So unless you're addicted to Mr. Annable's art style, just give this one a pass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sheriff and Korka most notably.Basically, take the first game, strip away any charm, rush out a sequel, and you get... this. Not like it's a horrible game but, noooo way is it worth its asking price.Oh yeah and good job making players replay the entire game if they screw up a single puzzle on the first try if you want to unlock the last puzzle, that's -always- appreciated... e.e			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												It's not uncommon for video game sequels to learn from the mistakes of the originals and improve on them. I was hoping Puzzle Agent 2 would follow in that honorable tradition. It did not. While not REALLY that much worse than the original (which I gave a general thumbs-up), it has certainly taken a couple of steps backward. The games' crayon-drawn style and sleepy setting were risky, but the first game succeeded in making them seem fresh and charming. In the sequel, the pacing is allowed to lag even more, and in order to follow up on the incomplete ""Hidden People"" storyline, it brings us back to the exact same town, with mostly the exact same characters, and even some of the same puzzles. In fact, the whole thing just feels like the second act of the same game; the experiences are mostly redundant.But the big problem is that, the puzzles, the crux and namesake of these games, are simply poor. The original had a clear progression in difficulty, with the few exceptions sprinkled so as to have an alleviating effect. In PA2, it's all over the place. Worse is that many of the puzzles AREN'T EVEN PUZZLES. One of them (spoiler alert, I guess) literally just wants you to recognize the digits of pi and supply the eighth and ninth digits after the decimal, you know, because we've all memorized it past the first two. The whole game, in fact, is so inconsistent that it never feels like it was ever going to be cohesive in the first place.And the storyline is no better. So unless you're addicted to Mr. Annable's art style, just give this one a pass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Almost goes far enough to destroy the charm of the original. Puzzle Agent 1 ends on a perfect note of confusion, exactly where is needed to. Though I would've loved to see more adventures of  Tethers, the last thing I wanted was every mystery of scoggins laid bare and boring with un-clever puzzles and a pace that's just...wrong.

												The Annable-illustrated and written puzzle game is back, but this time with more of the watered down puzzle mechanics and less of the wonder and style that made the first one unique. TellTale's second title did manage to tie all the loose ends from the first, and sets the stage for the next one. A definite letdown for a game that could have done more with the setting. 2/5			",3801,1542,162,445,616,53,615

												We meet Agent Tethers back in ol' Scoggins again, on a hare-brained quest to sort out what the heck is really going on and what everyone is hiding, in which he basically cracks and goes all looney tunes. Good times! A must-play to at least finish the story and loose ends of the first game.The story is a lot more interesting than the first game, with far more going on, new characters, and less revisiting the same people over again. (Which makes for a less believable detective story, but in this crazy game that's a plus.) Unfortunately, the puzzles fall down hard on this one, with everything basically being an annoying ""unblock"" puzzle, rehashes of the first game's puzzles with no new mechanics, or a number sequence. Every single puzzle was either solveable at a glance or unsolvable without a hint for me (I don't have a head for number sequences), so it wasn't nearly as exciting as figuring out the mechanics of various puzzle types in the first game.Still, the good voice acting, the weird story made much weirder but wrapped up nicely, and new places and people. The only downside is that the game is so linear that there aren't even any easter eggs for revisiting old locations, like in the first game.			",847,601,17,150,62,4,129

												The sequel to Puzzle Agent is still an easily recommendable game but it feels somewhat less inspired. The story is alright and fit to continue the first part but I cannot help but cringe at Nelson's behaviour as he unrelatably quick slips into paranoia. Director Jennings brings it to a point: ""Tethers, you're embarrassing yourself."" To be fair, Nelson's paranoia pace is sort of explained later in the game.Well, Puzzle Agent 2 successfully repeats features already in the previous part, likable characters, coherent sometimes creepy sometimes funny story and of course puzzles, puzzles, puzzles.Since you spend most of your time puzzling it's rewarding to see the puzzle evaluation being polished, more envelopes, more stamping, more feeling successful :)+ Fell-good pencil graphics from a 3D engine+ Coherent story+ Very good voice acting+ Almost no 'broken puzzles'+ A puzzle hard to brute-force! Pause your game with spacebar! Find hotspots by clicking a scene! Advance dialogue with left-click or right-click! Waste even more taxpayer money: 97,864.10$ per puzzle attempt- Again no skipping of cutscene-y sequences, including a lot of interaction animation- Less puzzle variety, puzzle classes- Unnerving susurrus, going into the woods makes my ears hurt- Buggy hotspotting- Incomplete sequence puzzlesPuzzlesPuzzles seem less intricate and more repetitive in this game when compared to the predecessor, with the occasional exception. I wonder if development felt the same and then decided to reward you at the very end with a really nice one.There is a number of puzzles that sort of fall in the same family thus adding to the feeling of repetition. One class I particularly dislike is that of incomplete sequences asking the player to continue a sequence of number of unknown reference and extent. I dislike them because references can be randomly chosen if the sequence is not completed with what the player has to provide.Think of ""What two letters follow MTWTF?"" Actually this is asking what two letters complete the sequence. So there are there is a sequence of seven letters with the given five-letter prefix that is a thing which you are supposed to recognize as such. With incomplete sequences that don't 'form a thing' there is some kind of description allowing for every possible follow-up letter or number or digit.The three puzzles with that problem refer to a part of a no longer everyday object of cultural convention, a mathematical constant that made it into pop culture and a contrivance of an again cultural convention.Broken PuzzlesIt seems one major flaw of the first episode has been almost completely eradicated. There appear to almost no broken puzzles, i.e. puzzles with insufficient description or multiple solutions not all of which are accepted. Specifically the very first puzzle accepted three different of the 24 possible solutions. As you hear a ding whenever that puzzle is done even before submitting, I'm assuming all of those dings will lead to an ""Accepted"".Mission: RockInsufficient description.The assignment mentions the bouncing of the stone but fails to mention the rock doesn't enter a forest tile when bouncing as opposed to the way light reflects off of mirrors in the brain puzzle or how the snowmobile bounces off of logs in the first game's puzzles.Gnome AppearanceMe being picky again.Yeah, the title has ""appearance"" in it, so I guess this puzzle is 'sufficiently explained'. From the pictures alone there are two possible sequences, only one of which has the gnomes appear, but the accepted solution has the Moon's movement wrong. Just think about how the waxing and waning Moon develops light patterns.SubtitlesWhen inspecting the stove for first time the text says ""Ms. Garrett"" with two 't'. Also, there are a number of discrepancies between written and spoken text.Buggy HotspottingSometimes we see inconsistent iconography for hotspots. Again, hotspots are revealed when clicking in the current scene outside of dialogue and puzzle. There is a green arrow for exits from the scene, a magnifying glass for things that can be looked at/investigated and a puzzle piece for puzzles. Now, from the main street the way through the alley is marked as a hotspot with a magnifying glass but it is actually the way to the hotel. The secretary in Olav Melhaven's cabin with the stars on its backside is sometimes marked as a hotspot with a magnifying glass but no action happens when clicked. Similary you will find 'hotspotted' areas later in the lodge that do not react to clicks.Not really a bug but bugging me: I like to identify hotspots in a scene before deciding which one to click next. Hotspots don't reveal the extent of the corresponding area. Although usually sensibly bound to an object I found myself time and time again interacting with hotspots before knowing the complete scene.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sequel to Puzzle Agent is a major upgrade to the original, with more challenging puzzles, more delving into the mystery of Scoggins, and more dark humor the sequel manages to expand on the original and give a great new game to play. Definitely play it, if only for some extremely stumping puzzles. But I wouldn't expect this to be the last we see of Nelson Tethers, Puzzle Agent....			",140,34,1,15,8,1,13

												Not very good. I like Telltale, so I had hopes that this would be better than the first Puzzle Agent. It is, but it's not great. It's pretty much the same gameplay. Slow, boring, and buggy.The puzzles are okay, though the instructions and the hints will sometimes completely mislead you so that you get low ratings because your CORRECT answers aren't what they wanted. Many puzzles are so easy you can't fail because you have to solve them to even submit your answer, and some of them are so obscure you might find them impossible without help from the Internet. Examples of things you need to understand: American currency, 10+ digits of transcendental numbers, base-2 number representations.The story was not bad.			",569,197,14,68,56,5,90

												The sequel to Puzzle Agent is still an easily recommendable game but it feels somewhat less inspired. The story is alright and fit to continue the first part but I cannot help but cringe at Nelson's behaviour as he unrelatably quick slips into paranoia. Director Jennings brings it to a point: ""Tethers, you're embarrassing yourself."" To be fair, Nelson's paranoia pace is sort of explained later in the game.Well, Puzzle Agent 2 successfully repeats features already in the previous part, likable characters, coherent sometimes creepy sometimes funny story and of course puzzles, puzzles, puzzles.Since you spend most of your time puzzling it's rewarding to see the puzzle evaluation being polished, more envelopes, more stamping, more feeling successful :)+ Fell-good pencil graphics from a 3D engine+ Coherent story+ Very good voice acting+ Almost no 'broken puzzles'+ A puzzle hard to brute-force! Pause your game with spacebar! Find hotspots by clicking a scene! Advance dialogue with left-click or right-click! Waste even more taxpayer money: 97,864.10$ per puzzle attempt- Again no skipping of cutscene-y sequences, including a lot of interaction animation- Less puzzle variety, puzzle classes- Unnerving susurrus, going into the woods makes my ears hurt- Buggy hotspotting- Incomplete sequence puzzlesPuzzlesPuzzles seem less intricate and more repetitive in this game when compared to the predecessor, with the occasional exception. I wonder if development felt the same and then decided to reward you at the very end with a really nice one.There is a number of puzzles that sort of fall in the same family thus adding to the feeling of repetition. One class I particularly dislike is that of incomplete sequences asking the player to continue a sequence of number of unknown reference and extent. I dislike them because references can be randomly chosen if the sequence is not completed with what the player has to provide.Think of ""What two letters follow MTWTF?"" Actually this is asking what two letters complete the sequence. So there are there is a sequence of seven letters with the given five-letter prefix that is a thing which you are supposed to recognize as such. With incomplete sequences that don't 'form a thing' there is some kind of description allowing for every possible follow-up letter or number or digit.The three puzzles with that problem refer to a part of a no longer everyday object of cultural convention, a mathematical constant that made it into pop culture and a contrivance of an again cultural convention.Broken PuzzlesIt seems one major flaw of the first episode has been almost completely eradicated. There appear to almost no broken puzzles, i.e. puzzles with insufficient description or multiple solutions not all of which are accepted. Specifically the very first puzzle accepted three different of the 24 possible solutions. As you hear a ding whenever that puzzle is done even before submitting, I'm assuming all of those dings will lead to an ""Accepted"".Mission: RockInsufficient description.The assignment mentions the bouncing of the stone but fails to mention the rock doesn't enter a forest tile when bouncing as opposed to the way light reflects off of mirrors in the brain puzzle or how the snowmobile bounces off of logs in the first game's puzzles.Gnome AppearanceMe being picky again.Yeah, the title has ""appearance"" in it, so I guess this puzzle is 'sufficiently explained'. From the pictures alone there are two possible sequences, only one of which has the gnomes appear, but the accepted solution has the Moon's movement wrong. Just think about how the waxing and waning Moon develops light patterns.SubtitlesWhen inspecting the stove for first time the text says ""Ms. Garrett"" with two 't'. Also, there are a number of discrepancies between written and spoken text.Buggy HotspottingSometimes we see inconsistent iconography for hotspots. Again, hotspots are revealed when clicking in the current scene outside of dialogue and puzzle. There is a green arrow for exits from the scene, a magnifying glass for things that can be looked at/investigated and a puzzle piece for puzzles. Now, from the main street the way through the alley is marked as a hotspot with a magnifying glass but it is actually the way to the hotel. The secretary in Olav Melhaven's cabin with the stars on its backside is sometimes marked as a hotspot with a magnifying glass but no action happens when clicked. Similary you will find 'hotspotted' areas later in the lodge that do not react to clicks.Not really a bug but bugging me: I like to identify hotspots in a scene before deciding which one to click next. Hotspots don't reveal the extent of the corresponding area. Although usually sensibly bound to an object I found myself time and time again interacting with hotspots before knowing the complete scene.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sequel lives up the first, and improves!  It felt a bit longer, but that's a GOOD thing.  Puzzles were a lot funner and less repetitive.  Story could've been weirder..and longer IMO, but still great fun.  Same quirky nature as the first but funnier.			",199,55,6,18,6,1,29

												Puzzle Agent 2 delivers the continuing sage of Agent Tethers. Gameplay is identical to the first one, but I thought the story was better. There are a handful of somewhat difficult puzzles, but the majority of them are extremely simple. Make sure you play the first one prior to this because the story will likely not make any sense unless you've played it. Another great title from Telltale Games.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Essentially, a duplicate of the first game, conitinuing the plotline that was abrutly cut short when the first game ended.A casual puzzle game that kept my interest up with the funky plotline. Some things were tuned more for kids, but the puzzles definitely were not. Some puzzles required application of logic outside of the problem space.A few bugs in this game kept me from really enjoying it - such as one a single accepted solution for puzzles that could be solved muliple ways - with no good framing around the problem to enable a decision to be made. The puzzles also got repetitive, with a core of 4-5 bread-n-butter type puzzles.Fun for any casual gamer, who likes to solve puzzles.3/5			",679,182,12,83,50,6,98

												Not very good. I like Telltale, so I had hopes that this would be better than the first Puzzle Agent. It is, but it's not great. It's pretty much the same gameplay. Slow, boring, and buggy.The puzzles are okay, though the instructions and the hints will sometimes completely mislead you so that you get low ratings because your CORRECT answers aren't what they wanted. Many puzzles are so easy you can't fail because you have to solve them to even submit your answer, and some of them are so obscure you might find them impossible without help from the Internet. Examples of things you need to understand: American currency, 10+ digits of transcendental numbers, base-2 number representations.The story was not bad.			",569,197,14,68,56,5,90

												It's fun. It's quirky. It's full of puzzles, but there's something missing. The puzzles are much more palatable, this time around, but there is something lackluster in their executions. The first Puzzle Agent was memorable for the number of times a person could mentally say ""Ah-ha!"" upon completing a puzzle and know they were right. In PA2, this ah-ha feeling is subtle or nonexistent. By all means buy it if you want to know how the story ends up, but don't expect the same magnitude of puzzle power.			",12,8,0,3,1,0,2

												Probably overlooked by most, this small puzzle game series by Telltale Games is a delight. Previously, I had not played many (if at all) puzzle games. I did not even know who Professor Layton was until discussing this game with a friend(PHILZY!). Nevertheless, Puzzle Agent and Puzzle Agent 2 were great games to play with a group of friends. Consisting of logical, numerical, and sometimes grindy puzzles, the games and story were a great break from college studies. Highly suggest for a casual gaming experience with puzzles that won't (necessarily) induce rage.			",555,130,12,57,45,9,62

And that's not because it feels unfinished, it just feels like a story universe that could expand into so much more and be relentlessly interesting.I've heard this described as ""Professor Layton if written by David Lynch"" which I assume is a reference to Twin Peaks. That is indeed an accurate assessment. This game mixes a hilariously dry wit and a surreal, dark undertone that simultaneously treats itself seriously while being aware of the ludicrous nature of its elements.Having not played much Professor Layton, I can't make a ton of comparisons, but the puzzle-heavy adventure definitely feels more gratifying than the inventory-heavy nature of many contemporaries. It's nice to never be in a situation where I have to try the verb on every noun until something clicks.The art style of the game is very unique, and after playing the two games I looked up the artist's (grickle) work, which can all be found on his YouTube. If you're not into mindgames, you probably won't get much out of this, but for those with a cerebral persuasion, the gameplay and story both heavily play to your need to ""solve puzzles"".

												Very enjoyable.  Not perfect, but very enjoyable.- I really liked the story.- The characters and art are great.- It is pretty short, like the first one.  (Short enough that I might have been unsatisfied if I had not bought it on sale.)- Almost all of the puzzles are fun.- A couple of puzzles had poorly written rules.  For one puzzle, I claim that, even after solving it and looking at the hints, there's no way to deduce that the answer they want is correct from the information given.- Some actions, mostly talking to people, trigger scene changes or story events, so I learned that even though I wanted to talk to people first and look around second, you should do it the other way or else the game might not let you come back and look at stuff.  (This kind of annoyed me.  Especially when non-talking actions did something like that.)I mention a number of negatives above, but all in all, they are outweighted by the positives.   I enjoyed the game and recommend it. ",108,121,1,2,7,0,20

												Fun little game. Not very long, and you really need to play the original Puzzle Agent, since they drop you off after the events of the first game without any refresher on the characters and events you should have already seen. It's a nice little adventure game, but instead of puzzle solving being done with inventory, they're the typical brain teasers that you might have done as kids (Ex: making paths of lights by arranging mirrors to reflect them, moving around objects into a certain arrangement, some number sequences, logic puzzles, etc.) But the challenge is decent but not agonizing, and even if you take your time and plan things out you might still make mistakes because occasionally the instructions are a bit vague. There are also plenty of hints you can collect and use if you're not very good with logic puzzles. Don't pay over $5 for it or you'll feel disappointed, but I got it for $2 and it's well worth it.

												This is even better than Puzzle Agent 1. It has built in humor and farcical attitudes, all complimented by the cartoon-based design. The story continues to be puzzled all over and sometimes it can get repetitive. Nevertheless, for the puzzle fans out there who enjoy point and click funny adventures, I whole-heartedly recommend it! It is also worth the price and replay value.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The formula is the same as the first game, adventure with puzzles, though this time, they are more challenging and there are more of em. If you got the first part you need the second one to wrap things up and understand what is going on.Again, a nice entertaining game in between.			",242,86,2,25,11,3,10

												A fun, new style of game. It's a Puzzle Adventure game, where you experience a story and solve puzzles as you go along. The puzzles aren't item-based, so there's no inventory management for once. Just story and puzzles, nice, simple and fun! The plot is a slightly silly X-Files style.			",47,24,0,9,4,0,8

												We meet Agent Tethers back in ol' Scoggins again, on a hare-brained quest to sort out what the heck is really going on and what everyone is hiding, in which he basically cracks and goes all looney tunes. Good times! A must-play to at least finish the story and loose ends of the first game.The story is a lot more interesting than the first game, with far more going on, new characters, and less revisiting the same people over again. (Which makes for a less believable detective story, but in this crazy game that's a plus.) Unfortunately, the puzzles fall down hard on this one, with everything basically being an annoying ""unblock"" puzzle, rehashes of the first game's puzzles with no new mechanics, or a number sequence. Every single puzzle was either solveable at a glance or unsolvable without a hint for me (I don't have a head for number sequences), so it wasn't nearly as exciting as figuring out the mechanics of various puzzle types in the first game.Still, the good voice acting, the weird story made much weirder but wrapped up nicely, and new places and people. The only downside is that the game is so linear that there aren't even any easter eggs for revisiting old locations, like in the first game.			",847,601,17,150,62,4,129

												Puzzle Agent 2! The anticipated sequel to PUZZLE AGENT. To be honest, I thought the story was a bit weaker than the first puzzle agent, but really this is a game about puzzles, not story and plot. I'd say this was good, if only for the puzzles, and I got about 3 hours out of it, but eh. No replyability, and the puzzles are sometimes kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but overall, I think i'd recommend (if it was on sale, anyway)			",132,45,0,34,17,3,20

												See my review of Puzzle Agent for comparison.I really thought that Puzzle Agent 2 really fixed a lot of the major flaws from the first. Fewer ambiguous puzzles, more substantial hints, and better explanations. All around the puzzles were much better designed, and as a result, I had a much better time with this game. The major downside, however, is that this game is easier than the first. Even the game's hardest puzzles only took maybe 5-10 minutes. A few puzzles might be more difficult for people with no background in math... something to consider. The story continues from the first and I thought it was decent, but it's more plot-driven and loses some of its charm in the rush.If you were able to stomach Puzzle Agent 1, then this will be a welcome improvement. If you're a fan of puzzles, this isn't as good as the Layton games, but it's cheaper and still fun.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												The plot was definitely improved since the first game, with deeper ties into Scoggins and new characters. Puzzles were also improved, with new puzzle types and concepts popping up around the game, preventing that repetitiveness feeling the first game got.However, the game isn't that much longer, and you may even get the same amount of hours out of it. While the game is fun and is a great sequel, I suggest waiting for a sale. It's definitely worth $5, and it may even be worth $10 to you depending on how much you loved the first game and the series' story.One note, though: This game has Steam achievements, but far more than the number of those visible. Each puzzle has a secret achievement and some events have their own secret achievements too. In addition, the ""Puzzle Agent!"" achievement is ""bugged"". The actual rank appears but the ingame requirements aren't correct - you must complete every puzzle with a score of 10/10 to unlock the achievement.			",228,58,5,28,11,3,22

The first Puzzle Agent had a great plot with an air of mystery and moments of susprise, which is unfortunately lost in this sequel. Puzzles are also just thrown in for the sake of it and are no where near the depth and variety of the first game.			",208,51,5,33,30,2,51

												If you like puzzle games like the Professor Layton games then this might be worth checking out. It revolves around Agent Tethers of the FBIs Puzzle Division returns to the town of Scoggins to investigate the disappearance of a factory foreman. The game sees you talking to the strange inhabitants of Scoggins as you investigate the disappearance by way of solving loads of puzzles.Good points:- the puzzles are enjoyable with varying difficulty- the games humour is enjoyable and there were moments that are funnyBad points:- the games story (thin as it is) presumes you've played the prequel (which i hadnt) so might be worth playing that first especially since its cheaper.- outside of the puzzles there isnt much gameplay other than interviewing a few characters and picking the next location to go to on the map.tl:dr an enjoyable puzzle game that will give you a few hours enjoyment which isnt too bad considering its not very expensive anyway			",446,133,17,76,93,4,90

												I don't understand what went wrong.The first game was pretty solid. Good varience in puzzles with varying difficulty (a few poorly worded and broken), conveying plot. This was a culmination of ""guess-and-check"" puzzles, with ""outside knoweldge"" puzzles. ""Here is a series of numbers. What comes next?"" was used at least 4 separate times, even more if you include the times when it was reskinned with coins or something similar. Do you know how many  days of are in each month of the year, when added all together one by one  ? How about  reconizing binary when the counting units are coins  ? This knowledge had nothing to do with the game, so here I was multiplying and dividing and square rooting these numbers trying to find what they had in common, but no, they were just  how to count on a clock, 11, 12, 1, 2 Finish the pattern puzzles, spin the thing to make it line up puzzles, bounce the laser around puzzles, move the blocks around puzzles. There wasn't a single unique puzzle in this entire game, even unique to itself. All of the puzzles in this game have been done to death, were used at least once in the previous game, and repeated at least once in this game.I was disappointed with the first Puzzle Agent game, due to the poorly written and downright difficult to understand puzzle decriptions at times, but at least it tried to be unique. It felt like a challenge. This on the other hand, well, I hope you can spin squares around to match them up.And as a separate issue, on the last puzzle I had a glitch where the main items of focus didn't even render. They were black squares. Through the final puzzles, through the very end of the credits, I had no idea what the items of interest were. Even the after-credits scene didn't load properly. I hadn't had that problem with either of the games up until that point. So I got to shlep through 5 puzzles with different skins for four hours without even a final feeling of completion. Rad.

												Puzzle Agents 2 takes the story back up after Puzzle Agents. The first game ends on a cliffhanger and this wraps it up. Sort of. I'm going to admit, the story doesn't feel satisfying at its completion. I enjoyed it enough. I think the puzzles are honestly not super well done or explained. The story is fun, the art, voice acting, and music are all pretty solid and I enjoyed it, even with its less than satisfying wrap up.			",145,51,1,9,1,0,12

												I did not enjoy playing this game.  The puzzles weren't very good and the story line was pretty boring.  The end of the game was pretty buggy and even though I slogged through the game, I was unable to complete it because a bunch of the cells kept blacking out including the numbers for the final puzzle.

												Rather than a sequel, Puzzle Agent 2 is more of the second half of the Puzzle Agent duology. It wraps up (or what passes for 'wrapping up' in the quirky case of Scoggins) the hanging threads from Puzzle Agent 1 by employing a similarly nutty narrative and a host of what I found to be more satisfying logic puzzles. It might be a bit of a cop-out, but if you liked the first Puzzle Agent, you'll like this one.			",326,170,13,46,30,5,24

												Ahh, puzzle agent 2...it's more of the good ol' puzzle agent, nothing special. Tweaks and enchantments are what made the game part better than the 1st. The only problem I have is that the game is just a little too short for my likings. But those hours of gameplay that you get are great. And of course it still has the awesome art style from the 1st game			",108,33,4,9,5,2,9

												Again rather short (like the first one, around 4.5 hours), but for the sale price I got it I'm not complaining. For the full price I might've.The plot is weird and creepy and random enough to be charming and it somewhat resolves the previous game, thankfully.The puzzle mechanics are better than the first one, unsurprisigly. It's a natural progression of developers realizing you don't want to require a pen and paper to solve things if you are making a video game. Unfortunately, it made the variety of puzzles a bit worse.If it was a longer series of games, they would have probably hit their balance eventually, but alas. And maybe realized that more than one sliding puzzle per game is too many sliding puzzles.Strange thing that I haven't seen mentioned is a secondary character design homage to the Broken Sword game series (the Korka girl). I thought it was rather funny.			",13,16,0,3,5,0,5

												I'm recommending this game just because it wraps up the story.Puzzle Agent 2 is puzzle agent 1. If you care about the plot, you will want to play that one first. The game play is identical and the only thing that has changed between the games is that puzzle buttons are in a different place now. The plot wraps up in this game and it's not bad. Unexpected? Yes. Rushed a bit? Yes. But mysterious? Yes. (Just don't mind a Deus Ex ending). As for the puzzles, they are more of the same. If you liked the first game's puzzles, you will like this one. In terms of difficulty, it again wavers between really hard and really easy.Overall, if you want an OK conclusion, pick it up on sale. Otherwise, play the first one. ",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												I absolutely love this game and go back to it every year or so. It's my favorite point and click adventure, and has a much more interesting world than Professor Layton and other similar games. I love stories that involve a small town of sketchy people that don't want the newcomer to find out the truth of what's going on. The puzzles may be a little easy at times, but the art style, voice work, and atmosphere make up for it.			",186,40,3,30,13,4,30

												It's pretty much more of the same, only with a slightly weaker atmosphere, some slightly more repetitive puzzles, and a slightly less intriguing story. It's also less value for money: for $5 more it's only about an hour longer, if that. Still, if you see it on sale, you could do a hell of a lot worse.			",650,346,12,56,41,5,60
