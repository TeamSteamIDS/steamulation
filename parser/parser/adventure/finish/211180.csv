												Unmechanical is a puzzle based game, released in August 2012. The game was also later ported to the iOS due to it's popularity on the PC platform. I am normally not a massive fan of puzzle type games like this as I just find my self aimlessly trying to figure out what to do for hours on end. Thankfully Unmechanical offers puzzles whilst challenging, but also offer a logical resolution to them unlike other games in this genre. You can often work out what you need to do on each puzzle within a few minutes of analyzing the surrounding scene. The puzzles can range from light reflecting puzzles, to memory puzzles. In fact, I have to say, I can't remember (ironic) the last game I played which had memory puzzles in, this game actually made me write notes down on a piece of paper in order for me to progress which again, is something which is commonly not needed in this day and age. The graphics and art style in Unmechanical are lovely. It has that mechanical look to it, with some really nice looking textures in the environment, and the animation of everything is just so smooth and faultless. Unmechanical also offers various endings to the game; which is something I only found out after I had finished the game. Thankfully you can easily access the other endings of the game due to the last save point being just before you make the choice so, allowing you to see them all if you so please. I wouldn't say Unmechanical is a difficult game as such, you can work out all of the puzzles if you think about it for a few moments, none of them have crazy resolutions that make no sense, and a couple of them are only skill based too. A playthrough from beginning to end of Unmechanical took me about five hours which is exactly the sort of length I look for in this type of game. I think anymore and it would start to feel drawn out more than it should. However there is no replay ability to it, as I said, you can easily access the other endings, and once you have done all the puzzles once, there is no need to play it again. Thankfully though, the prices reflects this, sitting nicely at £6,99 - which is just the right cost for a game of this length. I didn't have any technical issues whilst playing. Whilst the graphics look really nice, this game will be able to be played on pretty much any setup.I'll certainly recommend Unmechanical, if you aren't normally a fan of puzzle based games I would still recommend it, because I'm not normally a fan, but I had a really good time whilst playing. Hardcore puzzle fanatics may well find the puzzles to be a little too easy, but it's still worth the couple of hours of your time to experience this awesome game.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Falling down a pipe and awakening without a clue, Unmechanical sees you taking control of a little flying robot lost in a vast underground mine, as it travels through tunnels solving puzzles to open pathways in the hope of ever seeing the surface again.  It's a brief, ambiguous journey that leaves a lot open for player interpretation (occasionally too much), but accomplishes a great deal through context and the brilliantly imaginative environment around you. I had no idea what I would be getting when I first started it up, but by the end was immensely glad I had given it a chance.The first surprise came in the form of the fantastic visuals, which put Unreal Engine 3 to use more effectively than I've seen from some AAA games. Gorgeous lighting, a creative and evocative art style, and some very clever use of cinematography make moving through the dark mines a beautiful affair. It also helps infer a lot of the narrative, that without any exposition is impressively well realized if you take the time to take it all in. I do wish the ending was a bit more substantial and obvious when it was coming, but being able to quickly reload and see both alternatives put them both in better context (even if they still feel a tad rushed).The second surprise was that despite my prior assumptions, Unmechanical isn't at all a standard physics puzzler. Instead, every puzzle is contextually placed throughout the world making them more meaningful and the world more engrossing, and avoids falling back on the same types of puzzles as each is unique to the area it resides in. None of them are particularly challenging or involved, but the way the all fit so well within the world and manage to loop back around to each other is brilliant, and shows a level or forethought by the developers that's often missed in a lot of games.My only real issue is that Unmechanical does a very poor job of conveying where and what you need to do next. Half of this is intentional, as it allows the player to discover things on their own instead of being spoon fed along a linear path, but the other half is simply poor design as paths are often obscured or off screen without any indication you are meant to go back and look for them. This mostly meant I had to rely on the hint system a good deal more than I would have liked, but even then it wasn't entirely effective at guiding me to the next area when I got stuck, which more often than not required me to stumble around and explore every nook and cranny until I found a tunnel I'd missed or a door that had become unlocked.Aside from that frustration, Unmechanical was remarkably enjoyable. Nothing about it is especially memorable, but I was engaged the entire time through and disappointed when it ended so soon. Though it seems to have flown under the radar for most, I hope that this isn't the last we see of Unmechanical, as for the developer's first major release the quality is already impressive and would likely only improve in a more expansive sequel.

												A very sweet game. Puzzles can be difficult, but never overly frustrating. Achievements can be near impossible to get and some can't be gone back to once passed. Overall, a lovely game with just enough of a storyline to keep you hooked and make the choice at the end a tough one. I recommend using a gamepad, it makes all of the difference on puzzles requiring precision.			",70,49,0,14,5,0,5

												This is one of those games that's right up my alley. Cute little puzzler with no instructions that relies solely on your capacity to pick up visual and logical clues to solve the challenges. ...Allright, there's always the F1 key to give you a small hint, but the game rarely is too difficult as to require you to use it (plus you will miss out on an achievement as well... you wouldn't want to do that..)There might be a bit too much saving for my tastes, so that I always knew when I'd done something right. So subjectively, I never had a hard time with the puzzles, but solving them still felt rewarding. I somehow expected a little more out of the latter parts of the game, but the difficulty never really ramped up. I would have liked more physics-based puzzles, for instance. Maybe that is because of the overly simplistic game mechanic (only 1 action throughout), which limits the possibilities of interacting with the environment? I don't know.But then I think that it's allright, because I gained the impression that the game places more emphasis on the great atmosphere created by the setting and music than on the actual puzzle challenges. Stunning visuals and good effects, I like. I had a great time indeed from the get-go, which isn't necessarily self-evident with such a premise. I did therefore hope to get a lot out of it, but my first playthrough took me a bit over 4 hours, and the second one only about half an hour to get all the leftover achievements. Which somewhat is a shame, since I think this game has super potential.All in all, a great but short experience with little to no challenge.			",763,312,32,109,83,12,135

												Instinct tells me to call this a puzzle-platformer but due to our main character being able to fly with his little rotor-blade he never actually requires platforms and nor does he ever jump.  Our robot character is equipped with a tractor-beam which he can use to move objects about his environment and the physics involved are really quite nice and feel accurate.

			First three minutes of the game.		

The game isn’t very long, its maybe somewhere in the three hour range to complete.  There are a couple of puzzles that might cause a few problems, one that caused me a problem was one near the end that I completely overthought.  I started making a spreadsheet in an attempt to calculate the logic behind it.  This wasn’t necessary, I just wasn’t thinking simple enough!!  In general the difficulty starts easy and ramps slowly towards the end making it an extremely pleasurable journey.  Due to this and combined with the nice feel to the game I can see myself replaying it.There is an extra DLC which seems to be included at no extra cost and provides an extra world to play.  I have yet to test this part of the game.Graphics are nice and the screen zooms in and out depending on the environment or puzzle being attempted.  Everything is nice and smooth with the game being made in Unreal Engine.The developers have managed to capture quite an excellent atmosphere throughout the game with a great selection of ambient sounds which at times border on actual music being played.The menu system is quite basic and doesn’t cater for higher resolutions than 1080p or advanced graphics settings.  This can be changed in a configuration file (check the forums) if you need to.  I played through on 1080p mode wishing I could play on my native resolution of 1440p and then discovered this workaround afterwards.  Bleh!!  I give Unmechanical a strong recommendation to anyone that enjoys puzzle-platform games.  It’s a hidden gem that deserves a lot more attention!!			",1305,357,65,91,101,18,164

												Theres something that makes me really like this title, maybe its the charming graphical style thats through the game? Maybe its the simple controls making the whole game run smooth as can be? Who knows? The only real issue this game has is that its just a little too easy, most of the puzzles requiring quite simple answers and easy solutions. That said, the amount of charm pushes through to a reccomendation. Just remember to buy this when its on a sale though or else you may be left feeling a bit short-changed.

												A very engrossing puzzle-adventure game. Thanks to the fact that you can freely move in two dimensions, most obnoxious physics-puzzle tropes are avoided in place of a good variety of logic and object-combination puzzles. The environment is quite nice-looking, and even when the puzzles start to wind down near the end, the light story elements keep the game engaging. Definitely recommended at its price point.

												I have to say I'm impressed. Unmechanical is a cute little puzzle platformer with some lovely steampunk graphics and sounds. It's short, about 2,5 hours long, but that's not a dealbreaker. I do wish it was a bit longer though, because the world it is set in is just wonderfully crafted and the puzzles are logical. You won't ever die in this game and the puzzles can be solved without (too much) trial-and-error which makes the whole experience so much better. That and the game actually has 2 endings. Which I both love (though I prefer the ending with the scene after the credits). The backstory is done in such a way that it can be interpreted in your own way. Love it !So, this comes highly recommended ![Rating: 77/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												Unmechanical is a charming and endearing little puzzle/exploration game that started off as a student project before a development team caught eye of the group of students and teamed up to make a full-fledged game. It's built on the Unreal engine, once again proving to still be one of the most superior as the graphics are top-notch and the mechanics are simple and fluid. Not jutters, not frame-rate issues,  just smoooooooooooooooooooooooooooth.You play as an adorable little flying robot, who I nicknamed ""Ohm"" (based on the small noise it makes when it bumps into things), and one day as you're flying about with your family, an odd-looking pipe sprouts out of the ground and sucks you in. After a very long ride down a very long pipe, you wake up in a very strange underground bio-mechanical nexus, and you need to find your way out and reunite with your loved ones. As you venture forth, solving puzzles to pass through obstacles, you will find this place to have a dark and sinister secret.Unmechanical encourages exploration and outside-the-box thinking as it challenges you with a combination of traditional and environmental puzzles that test your memory and reflexes. Anyone who has ever played games such as Portal, Machinarium or Limbo will feel right at home with this one. It's not very long, though that can depend on your puzzle-solving skills. The game is solely based on its puzzles, so there aren't any enemies to stop you. Much like Portal, you either solve it, or be trapped. If you're like me and like a challenge with environmental puzzles like those in Oddworld, Limbo or Portal, you'll love it. If you're more of a traditional puzzler who often plays Sudoku and puzzles those of the likes of Machinarium, there's plenty for you as well. If you consider yourself an expert puzzler who utterly destroys puzzle games though, Unmechanical will probably be pretty easy and you'll breeze through it in an hour. It really depends.I suppose the only fair criticism that can be thrown at this game is its lack of narrative. The description I gave at the beginning is really just my own interpretation. It's rather ambiguous and interestingly enough, the game has two endings depending on this one action you may or may not decide to do near the very end of the game. Otherwise, you can simply consider it a story about escape. It's kind of like Limbo but you have a clearer idea of what your ultimate goal actually is.If you're into any of the games I mentioned above, I recommend this one. Especially to fans of Limbo who enjoy a forboding atmosphere and visuals that'll make them drool with delight.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unmechanical is a very simple maze/puzzle adventure game that I liked so much I ended up playing it twice. First run took me about 2.5 hours to complete. Second run took about 1 hour plus some extra time wrapping up the achievements I missed on the first run. So yes, this game can end up being really short. But if you don't take time to soak up the surroundings, the backgrounds, the atmosphere, and the music, you'll end up missing out on a lot.Even though you essentially only have a single ability, the designers manage to offer several different environmental variables that make you use it in vastly different and clever ways. The game provided a charming appeal similar to Machinarium and was definitely worth my time.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Unmechanical is a lovely game, filled with unexpected puzzles that are rewarding to solve. At times the puzzles can be very challenging but are in no way unsolvable. Also, there is a clue system build in so they will never get in your way. The world around them is beautifully crafted and fits in the style and story. The achievements are a joy to get and actually contribute to the game in a fun way because they encourage you to experiment with the puzzles and physics. As a indie game this is really impressive. What you get here is a complete product that must have been made with a lot of patience and love and for that the makers deserve all credit. For those interested in the play time, you should be able to get at least 4 hours out of this title. Make no mistake though, those are 4 perfectly enjoyable hours for a good price! Also, I would recommend playing with a (Xbox) controller for more precision, but a keyboard should work just fine.I can't wait for more from these makers. Maybe a prequel, sequel or a new game entirely!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Enjoyed playing this game many times on the Xbone, ps4, ps3, and steam. Reason why I played it more than once and on separate systems is to get all the achievements/trophies. If you're an achievement/trophy hunter this game, setting aside on how awesome of a story that it tells, has very achievable achievements. I did not finish the game on Steam though and that's probably because playing it on the ps3, ps4 and xbone got me burnt out on it. Other than that the game is wonderful to play. Just a little similar romance-ish story, like Machinarium, of a lost robot that needs help finding his way to his significant other, saving her and escaping together. It's also a pretty fun puzzle solving game. The puzzle solving isn't all that hard I will spoil that. Well actually it depends on how fast you can pick up what's going and how certain parts work really. I'd suggest it. It's definitely worth the play.			",56,21,1,8,6,0,3

												Very short game. I beat it in about 2 hours. So length is a factor you'll probably want to consider. That being said, it's a great puzzle game and the length is just about right. With a game like this, I could maybe see it becoming tedious if it dragged on for 20 hours. Sometimes it's better when a game knows just how long is long enough, and I think Unmechanical  knows perfectly well.There is no combat or action in the game to speak of. It is 100% a puzzle game. The gameplay reminds me a little bit of Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, but minus the combat, much more emphasis on puzzles, and MUCH more atmospheric. The lighting is excellent and there are some complex and gorgeous backgrounds as well.The only controls you have in the game are directional movement and the ability to lift / carry light objects using a tiny magnet beam. You wouldn't think much interesting variety would come out of just that, but the puzzles actually stay pretty fresh and interesting all the way through.I'll admit there were one or two puzzles that I managed to solve, but I'm not entirely sure what the logic of the puzzle was or why the thing I did worked, but you are probably smarter than me. ;-)It is a very short game, which may give you pause at the $10 price tag, but if the game is on sale or if you want atmospheric puzzlers badly enough, you really can't go wrong with Unmechanical. On the scale below, despite whatever doubts I might have about the price-to-length ratio, I'm gonna say that Unmechanical just barely scrapes its way into a 6 for me.7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Intro & SummaryA short, fun, clunky robotic romp through an underground world of tunnels. Built in the Unreal Dev Kit, it looks fantastic and is let down only by its short length. Billed as a puzzler, it's more about exploration, but happens to tie its universe together by letting you interact with different new discoveries, which happen to include many puzzles elements.HighlightsIn any other game, lack of lore, history or story would be a let down, but they help add charm to Unmechanical. It never pretends to be anything more than a short fun exploration of a cool, atmospheric world.* Fantastic use of the Unreal Engine, lighting and the great looking 2.5D elements add tone and depth* Pleasant simplicity and a well designed little robot, almost relaxing at times, without being boringMistakes* It's common to not know what the game wants you to do next, or how to progress* Some people will be disappointed by a short playtime and an abrupt endingRecommendationsUnmechanical is £6.99/8.99€/$9.99 on Steam and has a short playtime of around 3 hours and very little reason to play through more than once. If getting more for your money is important to you, wait for a sale, where it goes up to -90% and is a bargain for a buck.* Built using Unreal Dev Kit, you can access all the usual Unreal options using the console using the tilde key ~* Unmechanical has two slightly different endings you might have missed https://youtu.be/nRcojdDiQr0?t=224 ",632,194,19,62,47,5,80

												“The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity.”Unmechanical is a 2-D platformer game by the company Talawa Games with emphasis on puzzles.Atmosphere & Details: + Unmechanical introduces the player to a fascinating, mostly mechanical world with only a few organic components.  + The sterile art direction creates a rather cold atmosphere.+ The update ""Unmechanical Extended"" adds another, shorter campaign.o Solid background music.Puzzles & Gameplay:+ The player has to utilize various objects in each level. + Well done implementation of physical effects, and the inertia of objects based on their size and weight. + Some puzzle sections demand a rather high level of logical thinking and physics oriented problem solving.  o For the simple controls a controller is recommended.Character & Story:+ At the end of both campaigns the player may choose between two different endings. o Relatively short game that can be finished within a few hours.   - A minimum of story telling elements.- No characterization of the protagonist. - No voice acting during the entire game. Summary: Unmechanical is a short and entertaining 2-D platformer, that offers a fair amount of challenging puzzles. For a potential successor a cooperative multiplayer might be an interesting addition, which would allow for more complex puzzle sections. -- Estimated time for 100 % completion: +3 hours15 of the 17 challenges can be obtained during the main campaign. The achievements ""There and back again"" and ""Self Sacrifice"" are part of the extended campaign, which must be selected separately in the main menu.

												I liked to solve physical and logical puzzles in Unmechanical in a relaxed way.There are no instructions how to pass the puzzles, so you have to watch the environment and try the available devices. You can request a hint if you don't know what to do next, but the difficulty level is moderate, so you won't need any help to finish the game in a couple of hours.Unlocking all of the steam-achievements is more demanding.Graphics and sound are nice.My overall rating: 85%			",34,41,0,1,3,0,8

												If you like puzzle games that are not frustratingly hard and if you are fed up with ugly 8-bit graphics many indie games offer nowadays (it's art and so retro after all) then Unmechanical may be exactly what you're looking for.You control a little flying robot that has a tractor beam on its bottom. And that's all you need to solve the puzzles. You can't die and if you are stuck there is a help function that will give you a hint, so becoming frustrated is more or less impossible. The puzzle mechanics are nothing completely new, but there is a good variety and they're all fun to solve and most importantly possible to solve even without any hints.On top of that the graphics are stunningly beautiful with a unique Steampunk art style.My only real criticism is the game's short length and the abrupt ending. After exactly 3 hours I was done with it, which is simply too short in my opinion. But if you can buy the game while it's on sale I can only recommend it as I enjoyed every minute playing it.

												This game is cute, fun, good-looking but also flawed. The graphics are nice and you will want to stay in one spot just to look at the backgrounds. It's also fun to just poke around and play with the puzzles, some of which will almost solve themselves which is a rare find (but nice for the kids). Beware though - programming errors may stand in your way. On two occasions some needed objects logded themselves in a way where I couldn't move them. Had to quit to main menu, load up the game again and thankfully was kicked back to last checkpoint, making me able to complete the puzzles. Another time the game simply switched off. As I reloaded the game, it put me in a place where I was stuck beneath an elevator that couldn't be moved. I quit and reloaded and this time the game put me back a ways, making me able to progress past the elevator as needed.I played this with my daughter age 6, and as much as we really liked the graphics and the puzzles - only one time needing to consult online help - the ending was a huge disappointment to us.  The ending feels like the devs ran out of money or some deadline just came way too close. Either way, it was a complete letdown. If you have an intro, have an outro as well guys.			",21,15,1,3,5,0,4

												This game reminds of the parts of Oddword where you possess a flying slig and zoom around, minus the shooting. Instead, your robot has a small tractor beam used to pick up and manipulate objects. You do so to overcome obstacles to continue your progression through the game. Overall, this is a well-made, good-looking little game. It reminds me of a cinematic platformer (well, without the actual platforming) such as the aforementioned Oddworld and the original 2D Prince of Persia games. You hit switches in the right order and solve environmental puzzles to progress.Very fun and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Admittedly, the endings are somewhat understated and not as rewarding as they could be, and replayabiity is fairly low. But it's overall a good time while it lasts.			",418,252,28,29,19,5,13

												A sweet, pretty 2D puzzle platformer featuring an adorable little hovering robot with a rotorblade. You negotiate through various puzzles in a steampunky, underground landscape, using surprisingly accurate physics to move objects, turn switches and open hatches in order to negotiate the little bot through to the end. I was charmed by the art design and impressed by the lighting effects. All in all a challenging little game with appealing graphics. A great, inexpensive indy title for puzzle lovers.

												Unmechanical is one of those really unique and charming platformers,  I mean, it's not exactly a platformer because you fly so I should probably clall an adventure puzzler, or something like that... Eitherways, this game looks absolutely gorgeous, the soundtrack is pretty neat. The game really shines on it's presentation, after beating the game I can clearly see that there was alot of love put into this game, not only the visuals but also the setting of the game and the world and how each puzzle doesn't feel weird and works in perfect harmony with the plot. I'm not gonna spoil anything but I really finded this game to be special and for that I love it. Please buy it and play it, I promisse you that you won't regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The following is from:http://ricepixel.blogspot.jp/2014/10/unmechanical-is-not-word.htmlUnmechanical is not a wordBut environmental is.  And this is exactly what the game designers for Unmechanical did unbelievably right with how they designed their puzzles.  I have been developing this theory about puzzles in games as having a line dividing them: on the one side are inductive puzzles (puzzles that implicitly communicate their parameters to the player via the environment and leave the player to discover the solution) and deductive puzzles (puzzles that explicitly communicate to the player the rules that govern the parameters of the puzzle and leave the player to deduce the solution).  Now why did I use the word discover with inductive puzzles yet deduce with deductive puzzles?  Could I have used induce instead of discover?  Yes I could have.  Should have I?  No.  Why?  Because discover is much more engaging of a word.  That is exactly the attitude you need when attempting to solve inductive puzzles.  You need to engage every....... single...... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...... object......... because sometimes you never know which one will lead to the solution.  Now I must admit that this strategy is used predominately in adventure games with what I call pixel treasure hunt.  But Unmechanical did an ""amazing"" job at implicitly communicating the expectations of its puzzles using solely elements from the game.  (If it weren't for this puzzle I would be able to take that amazing out of the parenthesis but leaving the player to figure out how to solve a puzzle can have some backdraft if not properly designed into the environment, as I will now address.)The only issue I have seen with the inductive form of puzzle design is that heavy reliance on the environment to communicate the parameters of a puzzle means the designers have to heavily rely on solid environmental design.  It is very easy to make mistakes here simply because humans are not accustomed to this form of communication.  Imagine this: You need to tell your GF that you are going to be late from work.  You can either call her and tell her directly (deductive) or devise a way for her to figure it out as she interacts with her environment (inductive).  The latter is MUCH MUCH MUCH more enjoyable from a game design point of view...IF DONE CORRECTLY!!!!!  However, nothing is more frustrating than knowing the game wants you to do something before progression in the story in allowed yet having no clue what to do.In the end though, I applaud the design team behind Unmechanical for taking the inductive route of puzzle design simply because I don't see it often.  Don't get me wrong, both forms of puzzles are wonderfully fun in their own right but too many developers take the easy route of writing a story for a game, then jerking the gamer out of that story every time a puzzle is introduced to explain the rules behind it.  The rule of thumb I would have towards whether a game should have inductive vs deductive puzzles would be - respect the gamer's expectations.  If you have inductive puzzles put every single drop of design juice into the environment to ensure that the gamer is communicated clearly what is expected of him to solve the puzzle without ever being jerked from the story.  If you have deductive puzzles then take advantage of them by making puzzles with interesting rules that require back door logic, or crossword thinking to solve.  DO NOT make a game that doesn't know what it is because the gamer will immediately know it and hate you forever for it.Here is my Playalyzation of this game:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYBJxdpXNnt6LMk0EpgQ2gitOjWTd-jXm ",356,241,1,22,10,2,29

												A beautiful atmospheric puzzle game that, without much back-story, throws you head first into the weird underground world you must escape from. The puzzle design borders on overly-simplistic (I dont even understand why there's an in-game hint system you can activate) logic puzzles hidden among the lush scenery that changes the deeper into the world you go. Game mechanics are simple and straight forward: you fly around and pick stuff up. The puzzle aspect uses these mechanics very well and to their full force. The story is left open to interpretation (just like all good art) and by the time you finish the game, you emerge with a sense of satisfaction at having completed your quest for freedom (or not, if you chose ""the other path"".)  Graphics are beautiful, charming and original (where else will you encounter a giant beating heart with a pace-maker underground?). Gameplay, while short (only took me about 3 hours from beginning to end), feels perfect for an adventure puzzler. All in all, a great puzzle game that's lacking slightly in replay value but stands out in visuals and atmosphere.			",808,304,15,134,67,6,95

												Unmechanical is a lovingly crafted 2.5D puzzle sidescroller with tricky physics-based puzzles, lots of exploration, great visuals and is the first release of swedish developer Talawa Games.The game is based on the Unreal Engine, which seems to have been the perfect choice of an engine for this game. The level design, the puzzles, the lighting, the controls - everything feels perfectly right here.Talawa Games seemed to aim at a casual yet challenging puzzle experience. There is no health bar and no enemies in the game, so you can entirely focus on exploring the world of Unmechanical and solving the puzzles, which sometimes are challenging but never get frustrating.It's an easy-to-pick-up game and doesn't require reading the manual to get used to the controls - you just need 5 keys throughout the whole game. You steer the cute little robot with WASD/left thumb stick and activate your tractor beam with Space or X/LT/RT on your controller.Unfortunately, the playtime is only about 2-4 hours depending on your puzzling skills and getting some of the achievements is actually a bigger challenge than solving most of the puzzles in the game. Even though it would be great to see more of this game with new levels and puzzles, I feel that the length of the game worked out perfectly. Other games tend to repeat puzzles over and over to artificially stretch the playtime - fortunately, Talawa Games didn't do this with Unmechanical.Unmechanical is a casual and extremely relaxing game and the ambient music adds a lot to this, so it's the perfect game to grab a controller, sit back and enjoy some puzzling.

												Unmechanical is good. It's a puzzle game in the form of a linear adventure. This style of game has been done many times before and it's not very original, but it was still fun to play. The only way to interact with objects is a gravity beam used to carry objects and activate switches. The puzzles weren't too difficult, but some did stump me for a minute. The graphics are pretty and the environments were always fun to look at. It took me about four hours to finish the game. I recommend Unmechanical.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me be fully sincere: I bought Unmechanical because it looked a lot like a game I loved, which is Machinarium. And even though such a comparison falls short, I enjoyed it as much as the latter. But what is it all about? Unmechanical is a physics-puzzle game, which means your missions are mostly related to lifting some stones here, dropping some stones there. Good news is that the puzzles are really well-crafted, diverse and entertaining. The game's level design is terrific, and the gameplay is praiseworthy: both keybord and joystick work fine. Perhaps the storyline was the only thing that needed some improvement: we don't know who we are or why we are where we are; and the ending was also a letdown because it came too abruptly. In short, Unmechanical is a great puzzle game and could've been a classic if it had a better character developement.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: Beautiful graphics, fun puzzles, good sound design, overall great game.Cons: No calibration for the controller is available which means that there are certain times that the puzzles simply cannot be solved using a gamepad because going diagonal is using a percentage strength of both the x and y axes whereas using a keyboard is using a binary 1 for the x AND y axis. This results in a weak tractor pull when using a gamepad causing things like pulling a plug out and moving the platforms off of the battery compartment. For reference I'm using a Microsoft Black Xbox 360 wired controller. It's most likely the controller support was tested with a controller that would return a 1 in the x and y axis at a true diagonal degree whereas my xbox controller goes at a percentage value to make a true circle.Only one complaint, other than that the game was an absolute delight.

												Play as one of Amazon's delivery drones, solve puzzles for snarky customers who filled in the ""special request"" line of their order with confusing demands in hopes Amazon would compensate them if you(the drone) are unable to deliver their junk  in 30 minutes or less.Most of the puzzles are straight forward and intuitive but still unique and rewarding to work out. (no reused puzzles/solutions) The enviroment and level design are well made and follow the game's atmosphere nicely.Game can be finished in about an hour at a casual pace, easy to put down and pick back up to if you need a break. Recomended mostly for it's quirky charm rather than deep puzzle solving. I think the only caveat was that the ending seemed fairly abrupt lacking a big finale, I thought I was only moving on to the next area then credits started rolling.WASD/arrow keys to move, spacebar/enter/Ctrl/Mouse1 to use your magnet for manipulating objects/switches.

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Unmechanical. Cute and Short Little Physics PuzzlerGenre: 2D Physics Puzzler. Developed & Published by: Talawa Games & Teotl Studios	Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, PS4, PS3, Xbox One. Business Model: Cheap Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsUnmechanical is simply an exploration game with physics puzzles that often tie themselves together. It’s also really short, clocking in at around one to two hours. Side note, the exploration is fairly light as there’s no real dead-ends or open-ended areas you can look around in. It’s just a lot of connecting corridors. But the game doesn’t really direct where you should go or what you need to complete next. It expects you to figure it out. There isn't much of a story to be found in Unmechanical either. Your little flying robot simply gets taken by an arm in a cutscene where it’s shot down a tube into a strange world for it to explore. The majority of the game is focused on completing the various physics puzzles. While the controls are pretty simple, it’s probably better to play this game with a controller. The controls can be a little bit frustrating otherwise. Puzzle Difficulty and ThoughtsPuzzle difficulty is reasonably challenging. Most of the challenge will come from dealing with the physics and the slow response you’ll get from your character because of said physics. There are a few mind-benders puzzles that I had difficulty back when I first played it though I’m not sure they would confuse me again if I tried playing this game new now. I will say that this game completely lacks replayability. You’re in for the one journey and one journey only on this one. Extended EditionAfter three years, Unmechanical gets a surprise free update to include support for Linux and Mac, as well as a new hour long campaign. I got about an hour long in my playthrough so I can't complain. It's a nice little addition where two little robots get sucked down and they have to work together to get out of where they are at. It's not co-op or faux co-op though, just a fun story through another cavern filled with physics based puzzles. It definitely has a much faster pace to it and the puzzles aren't nearly as difficult as they were in the original campaign. Apparently this edition was exclusive on consoles until recently released on PC. PC Settings and GraphicsPC settings are ok but lacking a lot of fine control I would have preferred. You have resolution options, windowed mode on/off and a graphic setting quality slider. If you want to edit FOV, AF, AA or V-Sync, you have to go into the game’s .ini files in order to do it. While the game isn’t particularly demanding nowadays, I’d prefer to have these settings readily available. Just in case. Other than that, I didn’t have any problems with the game when I did my run. No crashing, bugs or other problems. This was one of the first indie titles to really use the Unreal 3 engine to great effect. It’s a beautiful, atmospheric game where you explore a sculpted technological and organic world. The amount of detail and animation work that went into this game is impressive. And the soundtrack makes sure to keep you immersed though it isn’t anything special. Final ThoughtsTo me, what's most surprising about Unmechanical is how very few people actually played it. It came out right when this type of game was all the rage and it just didn’t get a lot of attention. I can't figure out why. You'll only get around couple of hours out of Unmechanical and I think you’re better off getting this on sale. It’s a fun, short little game that doesn’t oversell itself. The story is threadbare but the puzzles are reasonably challenging and it’s a great looking 2D game. It’s a pity that the developers haven’t done anything since, I’d like to see what that would have been.  Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] ",242,50,2,39,45,3,57

												Unmechanical is short (~2 hours). Many of the puzzles are very fiddly. But the environments are nice to look at. For the asking price I feel there are stronger puzzle game experiences. Most of the puzzles here are one-off and there is little to no ""revisit with a new twist"" style puzzling where the sum of your knowledge comes into play. Don't get me wrong, some of the individual puzzles are entertaining. However, I feel like too much of the development effort was spent on the environment backgrounds rather than on engaging and varied puzzles. If you want this game, I recommend waiting for a steam sale where the length of the game won't make you feel so burned. 6 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some good quality puzzles in this.  Takes a few hours.  Visually impressive too.Apart from movement, it's a one button affair, controlling just your tractor beam to move objects around or activate switches.  That simplicity plus the fact you don't die means it's quite a relaxing game.			",1161,450,68,160,175,13,272

												You control a flying robot with a propeller on you head... well you are just a head, so... and you can fly and... Anyway. This game is beautiful and charming puzzler. It's and adventure game with puzzles to occupy you.You pick up things. You swap objects. You carry items. You rotate and align lasers. You time things righ so they get or don't get destroyed/damaged. You do all this in air, on the ground and under the surface of water. There is a nice variety of puzzles: some are based on sound, some on timing, some on finding items that you can put to make something work. Certain puzzles rely on not hitting obstacles. Sometimes you have to use one thing to activate both detectors at the same time. The setting is variable: industrial, biological, underwater, caves, volcanic. Variety is nice, but there are no sharp changes - it is all smooth.This game is rather easy, but very enjoyable. You just focus on the world and keep going on. Definitely you will not suffer from the same type of puzzles. I don't think there are any frustraing or even difficult puzzles (maybe the second magnet will take you several tries, but nothing aggravating).Graphics is great. Performance is excellent. Sounds are good and music is calm and pleasing.The game is short. It ends quickly and leaves you wishing it was much longer. This is my main concern. Is it worth playing? Absolutely. Puzzles are fun and atmosphere is fantastic. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lovely-looking game, the protagonist is given a lot of cute personality quirks, and the puzzles are varied.HOWEVER, the problem is that all these different kinds of puzzles are forced into a simplistic control scheme awkwardly shoved into situations where it is far from convenient or logical to use it. Overall, this works fine as a tablet or smartphone title for $2 or less, not a $10 PC release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have not played such a (design- and programme-) flawed buggy game in a long time. This is by far the worst thing since Botanicula (by Amanita Design).Design-flaws:1. YOU CANNOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS!!! What kind of a game does not allow individual files for separate players. Saving occurs… but is completely out of your control.2. movement is frustrating.3. some of the puzzles are nerve-rackingly inexact.4. some of the puzzles involve almost physically impossible feats, e. g., in one of them, one has to move a ball between a barbed wire of electrified nails with the help of two magnets, that are supposed to keep the ball delicately afloat without touching the nails. The puzzle is so sensitive and as good as IMPOSSIBLE: after something like 100 tries, I had to give up. I literally cannot play the normal mode beyond this point. Goodbye 10 €.Programme-flaws:* Individual saving is not possible* when you ‘continue’ a saved game the bot gets placed at the start of the level. YOU LOSE PROGRESS and perform the tasks all over again. The worst thing is, the game knows, you've done this and you get stuck in an in between state—some of the doors don't open anymore and you literally cannot play anymore.Summary:Neglected, terrible programming. Steam should demand, that this game be debugged.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What an interesting piece of work this is. I thought it was going to be a simple side scroller puzzle game with static rendered backgrounds... instead its a fully 3d world driven by a good engine. Truly has some creative work in places with the visual and depth. The puzzles are involved, with lots of physics tricks and mental drive. Fun causal game! The only down side is it can be considered very short. However if you snag it on sale, its more than worth it. I played it to the extent of getting 100% achievements, which is not something possible in many games with their ridiculous unatainable achieves.			",116,22,2,5,8,0,9

None of the puzzles are that hard, and the game is short - about 3 hours or so.  Both plusses in my book.  Nice enough graphics as well.  A solid little indie game for once.

												Despite its brain-melting puzzle and breath-taking scenery, only 1 hour of gameplay (including DLC, which is full of glitches that somehow slipped through) doesn't make me want to try this game again, even just to unlock all the achievements.I'd suggest getting this game on sale. I got it from my gaming website to write review so I didn't have to pay for it, but still, $9.99 is a price you should consider for 1 hour of working your brain on full power to solve all its puzzles.

												Mixed feelings about this one. Gorgeous, fun and entertaining puzzler, however with some serious flaws.1. Super short (finished it end to end in 2h play time).2. Since there is no map to traverse levels, it can get very confusing (and annoying) figuring out where to go next. More than once I had to find a trap door which should have been immediately obvious but was not, time was wasted looking for it.3. Slightly buggy as you can get stuck particularly when carrying objects but meh, nothing a quick reload can't fix without losing pretty much anything.4. Felt most of the puzzles were too easy. Many puzzles are impossible to solve until you come back later but nothing tells you that is the case which is frustrating.2.5/5 Get it only if its on a large discount and you want a quick brain teaser.

												'Unmechanical' is a nice little puzzle game that's worth a try, especially if you can pick it up during a sale.It's mostly for simply relaxing with but the puzzles are interesting, diverse, and complicated enough that they will make you think a bit. It is not a long game and can probably be finished in a couple of hours - there's no chance for getting stuck and doing something wrong that can't be reversed. Most of the time it is pretty obvious where next to go and what to do - a few of the puzzles and routes are pretty confusing, though.Cons are that the environments in game are similar enough that it can be hard to remember where to go (though it must be said that they are pretty and very atmospheric) - especially when you take a break from the game, which can feel a little 'same-same' in a longer sitting. There were some parts where timing was crucial, which was a little annoying as the controls feel quite heavy and dense making fine maneuvering quite difficult - fortunately they were few and not too frustrating so it ended up only taking a few tries for each.All in all, it's a nice little game for taking a break and worth a few Euro, though I would definitely wait for a sale to pick this title up.

The plot is given entirely without dialogue or text and is very much subject to interpretation.Today I looked at the achievement list for the game and didn't hesitate to jump into a second playthrough, not 24 hours later, to pick up some of the missing ones.

												This was a wonderful little game. The controls are easy to pick up and it's quite fun to fly your little robot friend around! The puzzles did require some thinking, but not so hard you'll end up totally stuck. It has a handy little hint system which I'm rather fond of as instead of it blatently telling you what to do, it gives a single image of an action so you know roughly what you need to concentrate on. Graphics were really cool in my opinon as although it was a 2D platformer the background was done in a variety of different angles giving the sense of 3D.It is a short game, but any longer and I think it'd have become repetitive, though they did well to keep the puzzles feeling fresh.Overall, glad I bought it. :D ",67,46,3,3,1,1,6

												Talawa Games; A team of students from 'Future Games' a Swedish games education project puts the heavily (over) used Unreal 3 Engine to use crafting a satisfying experience that only falls short for those wanting a well told story. Controls are devilishly simple yet never serve too tarnish or cheapen gameplay. You control an unnamed robot with an unflinching disposition that excels in 4 tasks with unmatched execution: Flight, Transporting Small Objects, Slamming into EVERYTHING, and of course, look like a precious metal child with a propeller cap. The visuals evolve as you progress, following the style of the puzzles. Locals include watery caves that evolve seamlessly into a bizarre fusion of metal and flesh. Musical queues provide confirmation when progress is made, giving a well deserved feeling of relief and fits in just right with the space around you. For 10$ Unmechanical provides enough content to satisfy without overstaying its welcome.			",286,24,2,11,9,1,6

												This game is so awesome, it has puzzles that make you think for quite a while and when you finally figure it out its so satisfying. The game has awesome graphics and better physics then most popular games these days. There is not really a story behind it but if you actually think about what happens then its actually quite deep.

EVERYTHING is mechanical, except for some rocks...and fire, and some sort of little strange raw steaks that act as switches.Other than the blatant lies of things being “unmechanical”, this game was very fun. It was short, but the visuals were a treat, and the puzzles were geared to a more casual audience.

												A fantastic and wonderful little game. It's not profound or world-changing, but for simple, charming, easy-going fun, it's absolutely delightful. (More detail: http://www.gamezebo.com/games/unmechanical/review)EDIT: A couple of years later, I've replayed the game and sense a certain darkness to it that I either missed the first time around, or just didn't want to see. Everything I said above holds true, but there's also a faint, underlying grimness to it, especially near the end. That carries through in the Extended Edition content, which by the way is quite good; more of the same for the most part, and the puzzles are a little more opaque than those of the original, but definitely a worthwhile add-on.

												Delicious bit-size ""ambient platformer"" that's more concerned with mood (primarily a the solitude that comes with sauntering through a deserted park) and sensory experience (lighting effects as they relate to revealing your environment) over gameplay. The subterranean world is gorgeous, and given the short play time, there's a feeling of there being ""more"" of the overall environment than the developers will let you see--whether that's red herring exits and rooms, or the simple promise of the outdoors.Overall, a delightful and easily recommended mix of Night Sky, Mechanarium, Aquaria, and the current crop of free-roaming 2/2.5D platformers. Here's to a sequel that maintains the ease of entry and lack of handholding while working in some of the wickedly clever intralevel design of 1000 Amps.			",446,284,15,83,66,3,112

												Unmechanical is a neat little platformer that requires you to solve some puzzles with the help of realistic physics.Not much to say about this game, except that it was a fun ride.There were a couple of puzzles that had I admittingly got stumped on, but it was still enjoyable for me.I generally don't have problems when reviewing puzzlers (...so far) and this game is no different. If people can find a sale on it, I would kindly recommend this game to them. $10 is kinda steep for a game that isn't that long, and would recommend people to buy it around $6 or lower.All in all, a nice puzzler to add to any puzzler's collection.

												I'm not sure if I expected anything with this title.  Sidescrolling, puzzles, pipes, right?There is no spoken dialogue in this game, but it's a remarkably flavorful dystopian crawl through fantastical environments.  Caves, derelict factories, and some more surprising fare - the level designers paid close attention to their work, despite the fairly modest Unreal-engine assets.The puzzles flow smoothly, with only a handful of stumpers towards the end.  The solutions tend to be satisfying and have a rewarding sense of continued exploration.The protagonist of the game, without so much as a name or voice, comes across as having both a personality and a purpose in this odd world - though I enjoy that its morality (if any) is somewhat grey.Gameplay clocked in at about three hours at a casual pace, with a few collectable achievements available on the way.  A surprisingly enjoyable trip through a clockwork maze, great grab at a bargain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is highly atmospheric, visually impeccable, and has character oozing from ever pore. Worth every cent despite the criticisms I'm about to level.  Firstly, the game has a very annoying tendancy to make you complete the same puzzle several times before allowing you to continue (eg. making you carry five rocks to a button when one or two will do). This tends to undermine the puzzle aspect and replace it with useless tedium at times. Secondly, it is far to easy to make a mistake and lodge a physics object in a place where it is impossible to recover it. In Portal, for example, you had to put in some serious effort to actually lose a cube because, in most cases, the dispenser would simply provide a replacement; this is not the case in Unmechanical. This issue is compounded by the fact that there is no manual save system, and no way to restart a level from a particular point. It is therefore, very easy to create a situation in which you will be forced to start again from the begining because a rock has landed itself in fron of a door or gotten stuck underwater. Despite these issues, do yourself a favor and buy this game. It is worth the $10 for the visuals alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I usually am not a fan of puzzlegames at all, quick to loose my temper when things get too obscure. But this atmospheric little venture with a cute robot through cool enviroments feels more like an adventure. Its a  puzzle-game though sure, but with diverse and logical puzzles that are quite enjoyable to figure out. There's a hint system in the game but i didnt know about it until i beat the game, the challenges are just intuative enough for you to have those ""Ah-a!"" moments quickly without tearing your hairs out. The game is short, thats its only flaw. I want more. Oh yea also my cousin made this game, but im not biased. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow. What a great puzzle game. Got so into it, so blown away by the beautiful and creative level design that I actually completely the entire thing on one pass, something I don't believe i've ever done before. There was one moment where I was quite tired (it WAS like 3am) and exited, but once I saw an achievement I knew i'd easilly be able to complete, I popped back into the game and ended up going on till the end. 4 Hours total ... which I find is a bit short for a game with such wonderful features. I know it was hard to create and all, but now what? I MAY be able to play the game another time or two, but other than that I'm done. It's all over. I can only hope the game gets good reviews and attention and the studios decide to continue on to a second installment. But that is doubtful considering the genre.The ending was a tad anticlimactic, it didnt even have the wonderful atmospheric music that was at one point in the middle of the game very prominantly featured in a 'scene' that was hinted to in part of the trailer for the game. My point, THAT scene was COOL, and the ending should have at least been that cool or better.The character you control has certain lifelike characteristics, likely part of the idea presented in the title for the game itself. Even the ending had me at least TRY to commit a 'humane' act prior to commiting to something more ... utilitarian? I gather this is exactly what was expected by the game creators. Bravo to them on a great game that makes you think.Level design was phenominal!!! The atmosphere was moody and the special effects, especially when you went under water or into the dark, were an absolute delight and an outstanding use of the technology at hand (running on the impressive Unreal engine). Though a 2D platformer style game, the 3Dimensional effects of the environment was impressive and at times very deep and detailed.Music was atmospheric and beautiful.Physics is an absolutely integral aspect of the game, and it did not dissapoint. I dont know if a PhysX engine (via an Nvidia card) would have introduced anything extra into this game (if they even put extra support/effects for PhysX), but it ran beautifuly on my moderatly powered AMD A8 APU based laptop.If you have any love for quality puzzle based games, this game is absolutely a wonder to behold. Though a tad short and questionably lackluster ending leave you wanting more, as a whole I'd say ""wanting more"" is a very good alternative to anything less.			",182,20,5,4,4,1,5

												Unmechanical involves solving logical as well as physical puzzles which are quite tricky but not too hard to solve. The gameplay and atmosphere is very relaxing. However, some of the puzzles require good memory, but a way around that is to draw or write down things in order to help you remember. While I found most puzzles challenging and got stuck a few times, it was not too difficult to complete this game and was actually very relaxing and quite enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes solving puzzles and those who like a challenge.			",255,115,15,22,30,2,34

Not a particularly long game (few hours), but I honestly prefer that; I finished this game satisfied, and not feeling that it was dragged out or too short. Lacking an interface and blatant instructions adds to the simplicity and pleasantness of the experience. Figuring out for yourself what to do and how to do it is the whole point of a great puzzle game and Unmechanical got it all right.Being a cute little robot doesn't hurt it's cause either! : ]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This adventure starts with the creature falling through the ground and into a network of pipes that takes him far into the earth.  It's your job to pilot the little guy back to the surface.  Along the way, you solve some puzzles, open gates, and generally run amok.I like the controls - it takes almost no time to learn how to manuever the creature.  I also like the puzzles, nothing too hard, but nothing super easy.  The graphics, though, are stellar; it's obvious that the game developers spent significant time on the game's looks.  I recommend this game to everyone who likes solving puzzles.			",129,103,1,39,18,0,41

												If you're reading this and considering buying this game, do it. Fans of Limbo will especially love this. I usually am not a fan of puzzlegames at all, quick to loose my temper when things get too obscure. But this atmospheric little venture with a cute robot through cool enviroments feels more like an adventure. Its a  puzzle-game though sure, but with diverse and logical puzzles that are quite enjoyable to figure out. There's a hint system in the game but i didnt know about it until i beat the game, the challenges are just intuative enough for you to have those ""Ah-a!"" moments quickly without tearing your hairs out. The game is short, thats its only flaw. I want more. Oh yea also my cousin made this game, but im not biased. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome little Indie game.  Great puzzle / platformer.  The puzzles were just right, not too hard and not too easy.  Great visuals as well.  Wish they had more pars outside.  Definitely would recommend to anyone who wanted to kill a few hours.			",199,107,6,23,26,1,25

												A fun but short puzzling diversion. Also good if you like achievement hoarding; you can collect them all in just a few hours.			",341,144,5,44,44,6,72

												Cute physic puzzle game with great graphics.  The puzzles are the ""right"" dificulty level.  The game is short-ish but good.			",310,64,8,52,25,0,60
