												40%-50% of the gameplay is slowly backtracking through the same areas over and over again, it's really very tedious and the game's biggest fault. The retro look is fun, the music is great, the puzzles are ok but the realization that you now have to spend 10 minutes backtracking to point A and back is just no fun. There is also the feeling the game is being cryptic for some hipster indie appeal rather game content reasons and the constant ""tweet this!"" prompts just add to this feeling, like the devs are reaching for cult status. It's not a bad game but I can't say I recommend it.			",34,71,0,29,0,2,6

												It's not a game if you're looking for something fast-paced and action packed. In fact this game is strange in more ways than one. But it's because of it's peculiar personality that makes this game really special - it's more of an experience you get to play through.It's a game for someone who's looking to get away from convention and try something different, as well as get in touch with the mythopoetical hipster side of them. Seriously.It's not just a game for nostalgic pixel-art eye candy, and as linear as the story is, the gameplay sure isn't. For one thing, the game encourages you to take your time playing through because if you play through this game honestly you're meant to take a solid month to finish it. It also encourages you to explore the environment, because there are a lot of great things you'll only notice if you take the time to have fun and click around the different areas you explore within the different phases of the moon.For such a tightly-packaged few hours of gameplay, it's an amazing game. Well worth playing through and grabbing all the accomplishments for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now this game was an unique experience. Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP offers you rather straightforward, but surprisingly moving story. Nostalgic, melancholy mood encompasses both worlds, and gets further enhanced by the music and commentary. Dry humour won't necessarily endear the tale to everyone, although I enjoyed the innovative narration.As in any point & click game, you have to solve puzzles (varing in difficulty and nature) to move forward - and, well, it took some time for me to get used to SS&S EP mindset.Music is beatiful - even if you're not interested in game, soundtrack is worth listening to. If you like pixel art, you will also love graphics. The world is detailed and alive, and holds much potential in my opinion; given how little we get to know about its mythology and geography, I feel kind of disappointed that SS&S EP offers only a small figment of its world. I would certainly like to see more.I recommend Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery EP to anyone curious enough to try rather meditative atmosphere. Do give this game a chance, you might love it :)			",87,89,0,30,3,0,20

												At it's core this is a great adventure game. The point and click move system doesn't require you to excessively micromanage your moves. The puzzels are interesting and feel part of the worlds mistique. The combat is appropriately challenging with the exception of the boss battles which are disproportianately punishing, and have you sitting through long animations between each failure. The worlds not going to blow you away with it's originality but it's certainly a solid execution of the classic fantasy setting.     Unfortunately this is all for nothing. Rather than let me sink into this worlds story and characters, the game repeatedly pulls the camera back for some 4th wall exposition. These don't actually add much information to the plot they just interrupt immersion for the sake of some snarky self referential, self congratulatory, ironic commentary. It feels like there were 4 writers and one of them was too cool to be a team player. After the second of these scenes you get this feeling you're just going through the motions to see the next lifeless monologue from ""the smoking man"". A lot of good work seems to have gone in this game, but an adventure game that can't hold your interest in it's story can't really accomplish anything.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nothing made sense, there was no story closure, no character progression, the game mechanics had no logic, no depth, there was virtually no interactivity so I might as well have watched a let's-play...  Pretty graphics and soundtrack, but that's it.With some games, even if the gameplay isn't stellar, a player can derive something from the feeling of being in control of the character that they can't get from watching a let's-play (The Stanley Parable is an excellent example of this), but that's not the case here.  There's nothing.The controls are point-and-click.  You guide the character around on a leash and solve ""puzzles,"" and by “puzzle” I mean ""click arbitrary things on the screen in an arbitrary order.""  What sort of things?  Click all the ducks, or click all the trees, or click all the bushes – in a specific, arbitrary order.  It's just trial and error, with no rhyme or reason.  If you think perhaps I'm exaggerating, I don't blame you, but I'm not.  This game really is that mediocre.Occasionally you'll have to fight something.  Combat in this game is an extremely simple rhythm game.  It's tricky-enough to be a little frustrating, and bare-bones-enough to be boring.The world that you explore is simultaneously small and tedious.  There are maybe three dozen locations.  They're all pretty, and backed by a great soundtrack, but devoid of things to do.  Around half of the locations are completely purposeless, and serve to do nothing more than take up your time as your character (slowly) walks through them on her way to the place you're trying to get to.To be perfectly honest, I'm fine with games having decorative content that's just there to immerse you and give you a place to chill out.  Trouble is, these locations actually GET IN THE WAY of gameplay.  I don't want to spoil too much, but there's a sizable chunk of the game that you spend walking back and forth between two locations at opposite ends of the map, and I am completely baffled by that design decision.Now we have to talk about the story and dialogue, and...  Oh boy...The game opens with a man who appears to be a shrink sitting in a plush chair.  He breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the player as his patient.  He refers to the game by name, describing it as a “therapy.”  The game is broken up into four “therapy sessions.”  If all of this sounds horribly pretentious, that's because it is.  The therapist (referred to as “The Archetype”) even subtly hints that if you aren't enjoying the game, it's because you aren't approaching it with the right mindset.The Archetype persists throughout the game, constantly giving you “hints” (more like outright telling you what to do next) and breaking the fourth wall.  There is almost no opportunity afforded to the player to suspend disbelief.Most of the game takes place in a fairly classic fantasy setting, with swords, shields, monsters, ghosts and spellbooks.  But the characters, inexplicably, talk like modern-day stoners.  That's the most accurate description I can give.  Even the dog.  No, really, even the dog.  It's not funny or clever at all.  At first it's quirky, but the novelty wears off as you meet more characters, and discover that every single one talks in the same way.  It's like reading a fanfiction that's trying for self-depricating humor and falling short.  None of the characters speak seriously, and it makes it that much harder to get immersed in the game.Anyway, that was my experience playing Sword and Sworcery.  I finished the game, and I kind of regret it.			",47,21,1,1,9,0,5

												This one is hard to review, and being limited by ""Recommend yes/no"" doesn't help.Pros:- Game looks beautiful, the landscapes are full of small details, every screen can be a nice wallpaper.- Music is also great, and environment is full of ambient sounds and effects that really add a level to immersion.- The laid back attitude of the characers and the dialog is funny and charming.Cons:- The game world is tiny. In real world I think it would be around 500 meters from start to end, and there is no much verticality, or many areas you can enter.- You often need to go trough the same areas, and walking is really slow and you can't run. There are times where you need to ""pull a switch"" that is 3 minutes away from the ""door"" it opens, then go back... and then you get killed... by a guy you killed three times already. That's why it took me 5 hours.- Boss fights are very slow and are all basically the same. Then you die, and have to wait and click stuff for five minutes again.- The world IS interesting, but there is no backstory. You are there an have to do stuff, for no reason.- And who the hell is that Archetype ? If you can remove a part of the game without changing it, then it shouldn't have been there in the first place. He's just...put there, like the Twitter integration... what ?Conclusion:I'm not saying this is a bad game, by the end it grew on me, but I can't recommend it. I think the game hasn't fullfiled it's potential and is overhyped. It looks and sounds great, but the devs missed an oportunity to make something bigger with it. Yeah, they made big money, but that it's not the point here. A bit more polished story and a larger world and it could have been great.			",62,19,3,5,4,0,9

												In Sword and Sworcery, you're a warrior, The Scythian, on a quest to get the mystic macguffin. You meet a few folks, fight a few beasts, and solve some puzzles (mostly by clicking at the proper time or in the proper order). This is all framed as some kind of ""therapy session"", presented by ""The Archetype"", a Fourth Wall-breaking, cigar-smoking quasi-narrator.The major issue with this game is its far too pre-occupied with being quirky and self-aware. If it were a person, it'd be that guy who confuses the simple act of dressing in a suit and drinking martinis with having charisma and gravitas. He doesn't know etiquette, doesn't have any sorts of skills, has no refinement to his tastes, but covers for it by downplaying the importance of all those things. He's too cool to learn the rules but still thinks he can break them. That he's too good to know that stuff. He has no game, but think's he's a player.That's what I got out of this game. The gameplay is extremely rudimentary and poorly designed on top of that. Skin pulled across bare-bones. Exploration consists of tromping across a simple path through several screens, very slowly. You click on things of interest to gain to be rewarded often with throw-away lines delivered in that Dudebro vernacular (""We saw a grave on the hill and wondered what was up with that"". Riveting). Puzzles consist of going where the hint tells you. This isn't hard, it's just tedious and time-consuming, due to the aforementioned plodding walking pace. You only have a linear left-or-right path to take anyway. Once you arrive, you hold down the button for five seconds to make your Magic-Mode happen. You then click in an arbitrary fashion on things on the screen. Sometimes it's sheep, sometimes it's trees, sometimes it's birds. There's no logical connection to the objects and the puzzle. There's also no real logic to the order in which you must click them. It's just trial-and-error. It's about as difficult and as fun as stuffing a bunch of random toys into a toy chest so the lid closes. Combat consists of a rythm game that's extremely rudimentary. You can block, or hit. Wait for the cue, hit the enemy, or block his attack. Sometimes you attack his attack so it's bounced back, and they might bounce it back at you. Repeat until someone screws up.So on top of this gameplay we get a presentation that's way too satisfied with itself. When something pretends to be much more clever or intelligent than it is, that's the textbook definition of ""Pretention"".Don't get this game, it's a waste of time.			",152,28,1,16,8,0,16

												A point and click adventure game that started on the iPad but been ported to the PC really well. Its a point and click puzzle/adventure game with a heavy music influence and it has among the best game soundtracks I have heard so far. While not being the hardest game ever it is still challenging and has a lot of humour in it so enjoyed all my time spent in it. Its a game I'd recommend pretty much everyone to at least try as is an experience I'd want to share.Mostly storyline achievements but some harder to find specific ones thrown in. I'd recommend a glance at a guide to find them all as you could very easily miss a few of them. There are also two achievements tied to not altering the time while playing the game (which makes sense once you have played the game) and one for....altering the time. Would recommend beating the game while only using real time or in-game means to beat the game and get the time-altering achievement as your last thing.Time to 100%: ~4½ hours			",943,372,36,86,96,14,164

												The triangles!! Anything but the triangles!Sword n' Sworcery is a rather unusually titled game. But it's also a rather unusual game, too. Not that I know anything about Superbrothers after having finished it, but I can safely say that calling the game an EP is actually pretty accurate... Gameplay is overall limited, and you're here for the 'magic', the music, and the atmosphere. Keep an open mind here, S&S doesn't play quite like any other game. You'll only be going through the game once, but if you finish it, it's a worthy experience as games go. Really just the perfect game for people who want a stripped down adventure game which focuses less on gameplay and more on the feel of the experience.Also- watch out for triangles firing lasers. Deadly things.			",260,76,4,47,18,0,48

												I really like some things about the presentation of this (it has a great sense of style, and while the pacing may not be to everyone's tastes, it's very deliberate and works with what they're trying to do), but overall more things annoy me about it as a game than not. I think it'd probably agree with me more if I were 20 years old and playing it on an iPad while sitting in Starbucks, but the complete lack of UI concessions to acknowledge that this version is indeed running on a PC makes me want to kick someone in the junk every time I have to perform any action. The dialog also crosses back and forth across the line between clever and aggravatingly pretentious hipster nonsense, to the degree that I can't tell if it's meant to be on purpose or not. I'm kind of glad I tried it, but I'd had enough after the first couple chapters.			",499,202,15,84,46,6,86

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EPSuperbrothers is an odd little adventure game. It's not out-and-out good, but it's definitely stylish and unique.The gameplay suffers a bit because it was born for tablet gaming. I own this game on my iPad, too, and it definitely plays better there than it does on my PC.The game is funny, and very self-referential, but the story is a zilch.  The story and gameplay combine to give you a ""go here, do this. Now go there, do that"" sort of experience. You don't do much puzzling out of anything for yourself. Just... go to the special place, and do the special thing. Now go to that other special place, and do another special thing. Rinse and repeat until the game tells you that it's over.But the art is pretty, and the game has a sense of humor about itself. It's weird, and oddly hypnotic. The music is immersive. It's not a great soundtrack that stands on its own, but the music and sound improve the gameplay. I cautiously recommend this game for people who enjoy weird, indirect, self-referential media (you know who you are.) But not enthusiastically. More importantly, if you're considering a choice between buying on Steam or on tablet, definitely play Superbrothers on your tablet. It's better there.			",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery is one of the most imaginative and beautiful games I’ve played in a while (that’s just my personal preference). The game is simplistic to play but, I was hooked till the very end. The game is like one of those “Where the f*** do I go” kind of games but, I don’t mean that in a bad way as you may think for the quotation sentience. The pixel visuals are really nice. At first, I wasn’t too keen on the game but, as I played more, I started to really love the look of it. The gameplay consists of you clicking on the environment to which the character will follow. You don’t really have full control of the characters but, I think it make you feel and take in the world and environment more. It’s a funny game but, at the same time, I felt, some sort of serious connection to the character as I got further into the game. I felt… something… at the game ended, which I can’t really explain nor did I expect. Every now and then you trigger random battles, which personally, I really like. At first I didn’t know what to do but you get the hang of it pretty quick.The game tells you nothing. I like games like that. It doesn’t take your hand and flat out tell you what you need to do next. Other characters in the game give you clue as to what to do next and you take it from there. Overall I love this game. It’s one of those games that makes me wish I could make my own game. I know a few people wouldn’t but, I would say it’s worth the money and if I didn’t have the game (as in if I had played it at a friend house) I would buy it for myself. Even if I finished it. I’m weird like that. When I play a game I like, I want to own it. Period. Everything from the music, to the visuals, God... i just love it.9.5/10			",176,56,3,15,14,2,23

												I wish I could give a neutral review, because the things I like and the things I hate exist in equal measure.Pros:It controls well. If I click on something, my character interacts with it. No pixel-perfect finnicky nonsense. You can click and hold and control them as they move, which is a nice touch.The music and sound design are fantastic.The overall story seems good so far.However, I likely won't be playing much more of this, because:Cons:The writing (the actual text) is dreadful. ""swong of sworcery"" isn't that funny he added a letterhahahahaNOPE. ""amirite?"" and many other things that made me picture the writing process taking place on an iPhone in a coffee shop.Twitter integration in the game world.Rather than just taking inspiration from things, they've decided to just use said things in the game, because parody is sooooo much more hip(ster).That said, I must admit that the reason that I quit in frustration wasn't the hipster nonsense (I put up with it so much in real life, why not a game? It'll be quaint in a few years as well). I'm just awful at puzzles. I got to the sheep puzzle and couldn't even figure out what I was supposed to do.SO, If you like point n click games (with some simple action occasionally), and can put up with talking to that local guy who wears a flannel and beanie way to far into summer, I'm sure you'll love it. That's why I'm giving it a positive review.It drives me batty as much as it makes me smile, though.			",257,85,1,54,14,0,24

												It's okay for a game to be tongue and cheek about what it does, to lampshade tropes and poke fun at its subject matter. It's part of being self-aware, of understanding your medium and using it well. This game is frustrating because it takes this to its illogical conclusion: EVERYTHING is lampshaded, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and you're never given even a second to immerse yourself without the game reminding you that THIS is what it is doing, and isn't it so clever that it's doing that and aware of it?Coupled with bafflingly poor game design decisions (that you're perhaps supposed to appreciate for the irony?) like running across an entire established world several times for a quest, being all but required to adjust your date and time settings on your actual computer, and Twitter integration of all things, this game trips over itself to get in the way of your having fun.The art is pretty, though. If they toned the smug faux-intellectualism down a notch and tried not intentionally designing the game poorly, it could've been a fun game.			",60,23,1,17,7,1,14

												Beautiful pixel art, stunning music, and a story that is best described as ""baby's first acid trip"". It's kind of sad how utterly the game play and story falls short of the art and music. Game play seems like it was tacked on or left so simplistic that it doesn't even register as a challenge. The point and click aspects are lack luster. The characters are all one note and flat as a pancake. The story makes no sense which is good if you prescribe to the hipster theory of “making no sense” is the paragon of art.The music is worth buying it on sale, but I would probably just try and find the sound track al la carta.

												5.5 Hours - all achievements and a game that has little replay value.  Less time if I used a walkthrough or youtube.Every review here is so on the fence about this game.  This game isn't a horrible mess and its easy to play (but sometimes encompasses a few frustrating puzzles) coupled with this ""I'M AN INDIE GAME"" mentality prompt both a curious eye as well as a  turned nose.  And that is the problem....if a person didn't feel some of the vibes that this game was broadcasting and left it more subtle it would have left the player feeling ""oh, well that was a cool and quaint little game.""  Instead there is a ""Tweet this"" achievement mentality (marketing) and a even a scene where - You're now at a concert rocking out with Jim Guthrie...""who's Jim Guthrie?""  Oh an indie rocker that definitely understands his craft and instruments and the composer of this game (which does have a pretty cool soundtrack) but did the game really have to take this route?  Part ""me generation"" development but ""oh no, I'm an Indie"" game.  And thats the problem.  This is why earlier reviews loved it but now every review now currently in the year 2015 is so on the fence.  In 2012 perhaps it was cool, perhaps it was ""edgy.""  Now, its a game that tells a quick little story with a few puzzles and backtracking.  The whole game can be viewed in youtube and while I do not regret having played it, and I am thankful for the soundtrack, I honestly can not recommend this as a buy.  Not with hard earned money unless you just have it to blow.If it is on sale (under $4) maybe give it a go, otherwise, move along.  As there are other games more worthy of an investment as the years progress.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:  Great soundtrack (seriously, forget the game, just buy the soundtrack) The environments are pretty There are a few good puzzle ideas here and there (liked the jam session with Jim Guthrie)Cons:  Controls - played through the game and still don't know how to do certain actions (eg. how to back out of a battle - wanted to have a chat with a character (Grizzled Boar), instead I entered a battle with him and had no idea how to cancel this), I spent most of the time randomly clicking things, even though I had the general idea what should be done, I struggled with HOW to do it. What might have worked with touch controls is poorly translated to mouse. Lazy game design - Most of the game time is spent travelling through screens or fighting with controls, actual content which required you to think or make decision could be completed in 30 mins. All the bosses are the same. Sometimes it felt that the game is being cryptic just to hide that there is in fact nothing to do. On the point of lazy game design, sometimes it turns out its more convenient to do nothing than actually play the game - eg. after I alter the moon phase in Moon Grotto, the spectre appears when I come out. Turns out it's easier to let myself be killed, because I will wake up by the hearth with no negative consequences from death and I save myself travelling a few screens to get into a dream. I don't mind artsy games, games which are slow paced etc. However playing this felt like watching an artsy animated film which requires you to constantly push play button, because it won't continue unless you do, although it gives you no challenge or satisfaction from doing so. The game feels like attention-seeking little kid and the feeling is reinforced by ""Tweet this ?"" prompts present almost anywhere. Stuff that might be interesting is killed by bad controls, so either play this on a touchscreen device or just buy the soundtrack. Playing it on PC is not worth it.			",58,30,0,10,6,0,11

												Ah, finally I game I can speak well of... was my initial thought. In look and tone, Superbrothers embodies a lot of what I love about indie gaming - simple yet beautiful. Even on first impressions it wasn't perfect - not as deep as Undertale, not as complex as The Witcher, nowhere near as difficult as Binding of Isaac. I began to get annoyed at forced wait times for the moon cycles, but there are ways around it, inside the game and out. But I was enjoying myself... until near the end of the game.Before that though, I have my own personal complaints. This game was originally designed for the iPad, and this especially shows in the game's combat. Fighting the handful of bosses/creatures relies on twitch reflexes, which is fine for touchscreens, but is abominable with mouse controls, especially for laptop mice. I can't move the cursor to switch between attack and defense quick enough unless I know in advance what attack they'll use and when - it's the same every time. I'd say the Trigon battles would be near impossible if they didn't follow a pattern AND that you can use your sword and shield with the Z and X buttons, respectively (I also don't recall that being explained at any point) Fortunately, you don't have to do this too much - once for each of the three trigons and maybe two or three other occasions. This brings me back to the atrocious wait times that would make freemium games facepalm. The lunar cycles can be manipulated easily enough through various means, but that isn't what I'm getting at. I'm talking about the Trigon boss fights. Due to the facts that you can only carry a few healing items, you can't leave the boss area once you enter it (not even dying will fix this), and the aforementioned terrible combat, you'll soon be stuck next to the boss with 1 star of health left, no mushrooms to heal yourself, and no way to leave to get more. I've been told that you can get health back between boss phases by holding the shield button. There's two problems with that. One, at no point in game is this explained until you actually say screw it and run headlong at the fight, and two, it only works for me when it feels like it. So, in my current position as of writing this, to beat the last Trigon I'll have to either have insane reflexes normally reserved for bullet hell shooters and not get hit once, find some way to make the shield heal thing work, or wait until the game resets me back in the real world to start the entire process over. Joy.This game is, in my opinion, more about doing the most it can with very little. References are made to popular games like Zelda and Mario, and most of the speech uses modern colloquialisms, particularly social media lingo. Some might say that it's just trying to trigger nostalgia, spread the word about the game, and add to its supposed quirky, self-aware pretentiousness. I would have to half-agree there, however, I only casually use social media and nostalgia alone doesn't work with me. Personally, I think the soundtrack and personality of the game are good, but it's not for everyone. I'd still take this over bland AAA title du jour any day of the year.The combat is awful on PC (get the iPad version instead if you can), the wait times are up there with the mobile moneysuckers it desperately wants to rub elbows with, and there is little worth going back for once you beat the story. However, I've played much, much worse. Go for it if you want to support smaller indie devs, but if you do want this game, then maybe wait for a sale - given how short the game is, $8-9 is kind of a bit much.			",107,38,1,6,3,0,2

												Sword & Sworcery is a highly experimental and artistic game, often too experimental for it's own good.Game genre: Side scrolling & Exploration, with occasional Action & Puzzle elements. Story genre: FantasyThemes: Minimalism, Magic, MythologySimilar games: Passing resemblance to Oxenfree and Kentucky Route Zero gameplay.Positive Minimalist art and sound design. I got the same special feeling I got from The Last Door and Gods Will Be Watching, where the pixel art provoked imagination, and the sound effects were sparse, fresh, and caught me pleasantly off guard.  The game looks quite beautiful at times, and it has won awards for both visuals and music. The visuals have since influenced titles like FEZ, Monument Valley and Hyper Light Drifter. The music is very enjoyable, and truly effective at both enhancing and complementing the game. The chilled writing style humorously mismatches the setting, is often self-deprecating and the narrator breaks the fourth wall, showing the game doesn't take itself too seriously.Negative It's not always apparent what to do next in order to progress.  You have to frequently revisit the same areas and look for small visual cues. The puzzles are rather abstract (such as clicking on sheep or trees, or slicing through waterfalls in a particular order), which is always either easy or obtuse, and consistently irrelevant. Session III literally takes weeks to complete, because it's based on the realtime lunar calendar. The game does suggest cheating by changing your system clock, and it also offers an obscure way to bypass this (which didn't seem to work for me). Doesn't quite live up to the epic finale it builds toward.ConclusionGiven that it was quite an influential game (now the better part of a decade old), and given it's self-depreciating humour, it's odd that recent reviews have labelled Sword & Sworcery pretentious. I suppose it is quite grandiose at times, but in a way which I feel is engaging and works. It may be that it's bold, experimental nature combined with some lackluster design decisions has made it retrospectively appear pretentious, especially as much of the artistic novelty which offsets it's weaknesses has since been incorporated into other games.In summary, it's artistically rich and design poor, yet I just have to recommend Sword & Sworcery because it's still a tonally unique, special experience to me. My woeful errand is at an end. ",103,179,9,12,10,0,9

												That moment when you want to write all positive, but that won't be honest.This game is very beautiful and cool with the idea and would probably be loved by those who are interested in intuitive puzzles that let you roam and explore... But hell how slow and repetitive this one is!From the very beginning a guy from your hut will show you several paths you'll have to pass in a sequence for a hundred times to get from one point to another. You need to activate something essential for you to progress (avoiding spoilers here), which is in like 3-4 locations away from your hut (walking from one corner of the location to another to enter next one and repeat same 4 times), you meet the creepy grim-thing twice on your path, fight it (a very simple battle that will still take your time), then get back to the hut and go to the Dream Land. From there you have to pass several locations again (oh damn so slooooow) to gather five sylph-things (small intuitive puzzles where you just need to find where to click) and then try to solve one more puzzle to summon a triangle and battle it.EVERY DAMN MISTAKE WILL COST YOU TIME TO GET BACK TO THE DAMN LOCATION OF THE TRIANGLE. It took me an HOUR to do all those actions four times, because I didn't get the sh♥t.Just because it's slooooow and you can't get straight where you need and avoid walking all the damn way again and again D:			",146,28,3,9,6,0,12

Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is a kind of game that you may hate before you love it. You play as a girl (that looks like a random pile of pixels) that explores a tiny mysterious world, fights deadly monsters and tries to make sense of it all. It is a point and click adventure with several fighting sequences. Sometimes it gets very confusing. In-game hints are often not helpful. You end up wondering around without knowing what to do. The fact that some in-game events only happen during certain real life moon phases (the game checks the date every time you play) is not making things easier. Use the guide or watch walkthrough videos if you get stuck. Judging by achievement stats less than 10% actually manage to finish the game even though it is just a couple of hours long. Things start making much more sense on the second playthrough if you ever get to that point. This game is beautiful. It is funny. It is confusing. It is scary. It is sad. It is weird. Very very weird. A review won’t do it justice. You have to experience it. And music... music is amazing.Rating: A piece of indie gaming art / 10.			",1590,795,33,164,161,17,190

												Superbrothers seems to be a game for a certain audience.From where I'm standing, it's got interestng visuals and decent music, but the narrative feels like a collection of tweets stuck together by gum and shoestring. Game is very pretentious and goes ""oooh, so mysterious, we're not explaining anything, it's so confusing to you!"" at every opportunity.Ontop of that, the controls and UI are garbage. The controls seem to be designed for a touchscreen, and while that isn't too bad on it's own, they also use a lot of gestures that would not be comfortable with touch (and are annoying with M+KB) - you have to doubleclick to interact/walk up to, press and hold to guide the character, click and drag to move screen around and rightclick to open combat screen. WASD/arrows ARE used in the game, but only to move around the viewport.UI does not help it at all, being full of slow, drawn out animations for everything, as well as being stylized to point of being unhelpful.This game is not a good point&click adventure, it does not have a captivating story and it likes to talk down to you.I can not recommend it.

												I can't really recommend S&S. It's really great to look at, has great music and sounds, but is not really much of a game. It's an incredible waste because what's good is amazing, but they should have put more work into the game portion. It's no better on a tablet FYI.OK, you click and explore a bit, but every puzzle is the same. You click on yourself and hold until your ""sworcery"" activates. Then you click on usually obvious stuff in the background until you solve the puzzle. Advanced puzzles involve clicking and holding. Seriously it's that simple. You're going to walk slowly through the same (gorgeous) screens over and over. You're going to watch the album flip slowly from side A to B at least 3 times. Combat is slightly more engaging, but it's really just like quick time events. Often it's an actual QTE when your shield lights up and you click it. There are no inventory puzzles.Jim Guthrie makes great music, and this game is basically an ad for his album. At one point you wander into one of his concerts.I couldn't stand the writing. On the one hand you have a bronze age story of confronting an ancient evil, but everyone is self-referential undermining the mythopoesis of the world (they use that word in the game FYI). It's 4th wall breaking. I guess to keep you from being immersed in the game world for some reason. It's beautiful, but I think they realized it was too small.Finally, there are some Legend of Zelda references for some reason. You are collecting 3 triangles and one of your first acts is to enter a giant stone head of Gannon. Your final act does something and you die. I guess you stopped an ancient evil but there's no payoff. The burn your body and people cry but I didn't care about any of the characters or what I was doing.			",774,353,18,78,58,6,72

												TL;DR This is a frail attempt at a ""2deep4u"" sound-art based exploration adventure game complete with horrid combat, inconsistent visuals, and an entirely unremarkable soundtrack. Your time is legitimately better spent on another game.  2/10To get into why without examining every little detail of the game, let me break this down into the main components and try to keep it short. References, Fourth Wall Breaking, Social Media This game starts off immediately making references to the Zelda franchise to the point of directly using the phrase ""skyward sword"" and having the main objective of power be the ""trigon trifecta"" which is literally just the Triforce. You didn't even try. Also of note are the very direct and out of place fourth wall breaks where the player is directly addressed and at some point even complimented for playing. Modern lingo and objects makes the player all too aware that the writer (I'm assuming Jim Guthrie, the singer-songwriter behind this) thought he was being very cool and unique, using terms like ""dude"", calling the female character ""Girl"", and even having a pixel version of himself playing a rock show in game complete with huge modern speaker systems surrounded by people who live in log huts. Social media is forced down the players throat at the very beginning of the game encouraging them to tweet some of these awful ""this is so deep"" quotes out to the world and while optional, put a huge stain on any game even having these buttons present. Art Since this is a big selling point the game tries to stand on, it ought to be quite beautiful, and in some areas it actually is decent. The starting meadow is quite peaceful and beatiful and with the soothing soundtrack playing I thought I was in for something good. Shapes were recognizable enough despite being very blocky, people looked simply like abstracted people and that's perfectly ok. I noticed very early on however that the inconsistencies with the art are not limited to UI elements. The trigons (just triangles) the game seems so very focused on were very obviously out of place with no pixelation to have them settle into the motif. And this was even worse with these ugly gradiants on many of the entities such as the sprites and the evil spirit, and even all over many of the effects in the game. The record with the Triforce on it is a very poor quality image complimented by the awful MSPaint star effect that it rests on when activated. Let me do a small sin and compare this to another recent pixel art game, Hyper Light Drifter. Whereas character animations in HLD move fluidly, with intent but natural, SSSEP is slow, clunky, very uninventive, and (as dumb as it may sound) blocky. The same  can be said of some of the effects animations as well, those that were'nt gradiants at least. Overall the sort of soothing and calm atmosphere it tries to build is lost by the lack of technical ability to make a pixelated world really spring to life.  Music & Sounds The other main selling point of the game is of course the soundtrack as this is some sort of experimental hybrid EP and video game. Some of the soundscapes were quite pretty and added an enjoyable element to the scenery. The little blurb the sprites make when you click to make them ascend I found to be quite pleasing. The main body of the music however is entirely lackluster. Simple patterns are made up of alright guitar and very poor synth sections, sometimes broken up by simple drum loops. The EP (actually a 27 song, just over an hour long album) adds essentially nothing to the music you've already heard playing the game, just that there's slightly less looping of the same sections. The sound effects themselves are pretty much alright alone but again suffer from massive inconsistency where a bitcrushed fight engaging sound takes place right next to an enemy dog growling that seems like it's just some stock recording. Some sounds even seem like a post production element was added to make them sound like they were bitcrushed. One of the worst offenses in this category though is that at one point the relatively silent Logfella just starts giving this awfully acted monologue rattling off about being boring or something, and it shocked the hell out of me, I could not believe it was that poorly done and out of place. Other than that dialogue is restricted to grunts, humming, and the occasional ""Hey"" which is brief enough not to be silly. Gameplay, Mechanics Whoo boy. This is some of the worst mechanical and gameplay design I've ever seen in a game. I understand this was made also with tablet/phone gaming in mind but oh god. Every combat section in the game is very literally just a QTE. Controls are just point and click, this isn't bad in itself but some things are painful. Movement is very unintuitive but there's so little of it since paths are just straight lines most of the time. You can't open your item menu without stopping your character's movement, and every menu in the game is slow. Opening the book takes ages, complimented only by the poor design where messages are chronologically recorded backwards but only in breif periods. You move so slowly across the screen even when ""fast"" moving to an exit. And this is made even worse by the fact that some areas have scripted cutscenes that must play as you enter, every time. One of the worst things out of all of the mechanics is that you have the option to ""play the game as it was meant to be played"" and wait for the literal phases of Earth's moon to change the phase of the in game moon to progress. You can access a room in game to change it luckily or this review would be very short. You can also change the clock on your PC or device, but the game will record change and give you only 99% completion when finished.I definitely failed to keep this review short but it's relatively short compared to all that I thought about writing. Also whoever drew and animated a bear-man's twig-n-berries, you know that was unnecessary.			",107,9,3,11,5,1,3

												Really frustrating in the bad kind of way. It takes A LOT of patience to sit there and watch your character walk places, and the computer contols were terrible. Sword and shield need to be buttons on the keyboard or just left click / right click. You literally have to click an on screen interface as your ""controller"". I figured out that you have to change your computer time to play through this game in one sitting, but I never found any hints as to when to set my computer to. 4 days forward was the friggin' magic amount.

												I cannot in good conscience recommend this game because of the obtuse and overbearing mechanic of linking the ability of players to complete tasks based on an internal clock that uses the real world phases of the moon to attain specific objectives.  While there is an item that allows for the changes of said phases to occur at the player's control, it can only be attained at a late stage of the game.  (or by cheating as per the game's own advise)It is also incredibly important to point out that if players get the ""Dark Moon Trigon"" before the ""Bright Moon Trigon"" said time shifting item becomes unavailable.  So if the game is being played while there is a new moon, then the player will have to wait 2 weeks of real time for a full moon to try to attain the Bright Moon Trigon first.  A developer that thinks that making people wait to play the game in such a manner is utterly arrogant and annoying.  Such a mechanic was certainly implemented to artificially give a false impression of length as the game can be completed in a manner of a few hours of real gameplay.  While the “retro” style graphics have some charm, these outstay their welcome as there are just a handful of environments to view and backtrack through multiple times.  Also, there is a certain sense of artistic “cheat” since the graphics don't rely on pure 8-bit pixelated effects, but rather it is a mix of these and modern 2D rendering techniques.Repetitive enemy encounters against what is in essence the same enemy over an over again, boring and extended periods of time where the only interaction is to click on the exit point of an environment and then see the Scythian slowly make her way across the screen while the player has a thumb up the proverbial♥♥♥♥♥♥makes this game an absolute chore.The combat system while using a “rhythm” mechanic that some might find amusing, it boils down to either blocking, dodging or striking – any other nuance to the system is completely missing and to make matters even more tedious all Trigon battles are, save negligible differences, exactly the same.The puzzles range from obscure to plainly obvious, nothing remarkable to speak off.  The Scythian is one of the most forgettable characters in one of the most boring games I've played in a very long time.   Avoid and instead invest your time on other indie games that offer better propositions than Sword and Swordcery.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery is easily one of the most unusual, nonsensical, gorgeous games I've ever played. As I write this, I'm still not entirely sure how to describe what exactly it was I experienced. The general gameplay consists of you searching beautiful low poly. highly detailed environments for strange creatures known as 'sylvan sprites' by clicking multiple points in the environment. The game gives very little direction as to what parts of the environment you should be clicking and the direction that the game does decide to give you is delivered via nonsensical, highly confusing messages through in game twitter like updates from the few characters. While I presume these messages were meant to contain hints, half the time I couldn't decipher what was random nonsense and what was the game's way of trying to point me in a particular direction. This resulted in me randomly clicking my way through most of the puzzles, which worked out fine except on a handful of occasions. While the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, it's everything else that makes this game worth experiencing. The writing, while cryptic and often times silly, sets a very laid back tone as you quest to save this musically infused world.The charming art design combined with the beautifully composed music gives this game a sense of style like no other and I often found myself in awe of the relationship between the two.The story isn't partiuclarly deep or complex but the quirky and episodic nature in which it unfolds makes this a game worth seeing through to the end.

												I honestly had to think about whether or not to give this one a thumbs up. I loved it all the way through, but some of the negative reviews here have some points. For one thing the game is terribly short - though it says 'small world' in the game description. Another is that the click to move is often considerably slower and more clumsy than I would like, and finally the humor is hit or miss. Sometimes it puts a grin on your face, other times it's eye-roll worthy.With that said, this is roughly the equivelant of an indie prog-rock concept album, only instead of lyrics you get gameplay. Most of the puzzles involve clicking and experimenting with the environment while 'meditating' and are all in themselves relatively simple. The combat involves some reflexes, but has set patterns which can allow even people with slow reflexes to survive it. The star of the show is the music - play this with a good set of headphones and enjoy the atmosphere it creates, don't play this game if you like to rush, and don't go expecting shakespeare instead of beowulf. I found it a really fantastic experience that was definitely worth the price of a movie ticket. I would take a chance on it - there is always the refund.			",121,54,0,22,12,0,31

												This mouse-only game has a great soundtrack and some genuinely funny moments. I liked the game's narrative style and delivery, but if you're not into the music or humor, there may not be enough here for you to enjoy. There's not a lot of depth to the gameplay; you're mostly clicking on objects in the environment to solve puzzles, and occasionally sword fighting via a simple timing and pattern recognition mechanic.  For me, I'm not sure the game lived up to the hype that seems to surround it, but if you're a fan of adventure games, good soundtracks, and some occasional absurd dialogue, it's worth checking out. Despite the reservations I just voiced, I enjoyed playing it and I'm glad I saw it through to the finish.			",588,210,7,54,40,7,79

												This game is scenic, atmospheric, and the pixel artwork is impressive.  It incorporates music really well - and is lively when progress is made.  It even has humorous and witty dialogue that breaks the 4th wall at times.  It is easy to see how it could influence other creators.  On the negative side, it was unneccessarily cryptic, and I would be suprised if most people beat it without a walkthrough or guide.  While playing, I perceived the creators to be self-indulgent and protentious, and cursed them for being so obtuse about how to actually beat the game.  I appreciated the ending but it's hard to recommend.			",112,20,2,5,4,0,6

												One of my many ""Steam rules"" is not to buy a mobile game, but this game ... man, this game masterfully blends music, art, storytelling and gameplay in deeply poetic ways that you just don't see very often. It may only take a handful of hours to play through the game's four chapters, but the impact it leaves will stay with you for a long time.

												Beautiful game.The art style is pixelated, but far from retro. There's a sort of cave-painting look to it, but it also feels very modern and it's animated wonderfully.The music has a very unique style that really suits the game's bizare world. It's a catchy and atmospheric sountrack. Some tracks are jolly and bouncy, others are dark and haunting. All great stuff.The gameplay is extremely original. It's in one sense a point-&-click adventure, but it uses your mouse in all manor of creative and interesting ways that make interacting with the game an absolute delight.The story is a strange fantasy ordeal, but it's told with loads of wit and charm. It's captivating and full of intruige, and it does a great job of making you care for the characters.Yeah. So, good game. Weird game but a really cool one.			",194,49,1,10,7,1,9

												I have to say.. I was expecting more.The game seems to rely heavily on its aesthetic - and I'll grant it a pretty nice audioset and a beautiful world, at first glance, but.. that's it? I found myself feeling more ""and..?"" than intrigued.Most of all, for a game that relies almost exclusively on its aesthetic.. why is it so jarringly broken? The gradiant around the sword/shield in the combat UI? The background gradiants? The tacky pop-up buttons that look totally out of place? Gtradiant omn mouse clicks? The weird health stars that aren't pixel-art at all? If you're going for a style, by all means do so, but if your game is mostly just the look, sound, and aesthetic, well.. you gotta hammer that home.The controls being entirely mouse-click based just felt kinda needlessly sluggish, and I was feeling punished for trying to explore around a bit. Nothing about the world immediately pulled me in, and while I may come back to it when I'm feeling in a more to play a game one-handed while my other hand props up my chin from almost-boredom, I'll giave it another shot. Maybe there's more to it, but nobody wants to find the ""more to it"" if there's not ""something to it"" from the get go. :(			",216,47,0,74,1,0,17

												One of my favorite games of all time. The soundtrack alone is a masterpiece, and the game itself is fun, accessible (if you pay attention to the hints, which, granted, can sometimes be a bit esoteric. Don't forget to always talk to everyone and read the megatome!) in addition to perfectly balancing cute moments with dark moments. I reccomend playing the way the game itself suggests - in segments. Its not super long, and taking some time from the game to return in a different mood will help you better understand what the game is doing. I bought it way back when it was first released on iphone and while the game is relatively short, I've played it multiple times and have had many great experiences with it. An entirely unique game in its own right that many can enjoy. 10/10 would Sworcery again.			",95,32,1,18,3,0,10

												I'm really intrigued by what I just played. Sword & Sworcery is a strange mix of funny self-awareness as a game and art project; pretty pixel landscapes and nice soundtrack; all mixed in a plot that goes from the super-serious to the super-casual in waves. The game is never out-right comedic, but you can tell from screen to screen where you're supposed to relax and where you are supposed to be tense. What fascinates me is how even with its pixelated characters the game manages to make you feel stressed, afraid, rejoiced or frustrated as you go. One of the game elements that is constant throughout the story is the lack of a expectations on what is possible and what not within the environment. I found myself unable to judge if I had any agency in this or that environment or situation, which in this game, is a good thing. You feel great when you realize that you CAN interact with this or that element, and once the creepy monster starts to chase you, this lack of understanding about where are the game-boundries makes you feel trapped and powerless as you desperately click everything on screen while moving away as you trying to figure out what to do next.Granted, this lack of context did made me go for an online guide once I couldn't figure out how to wake up one or two of the Sprites. But overall, if you have enough curiosity and patience, you will get the hang of this strange little world without external help.Another thing that I found really original about this game is how the difficulty raises as the story progesses. We're used to getting more health and power in other titles, allowing you to combat fiercer and bigger enemies as you go. But in Sword & Sworcery you get LESS health as the main character's well-being begins taking a toll on the quest, which makes formerly easy challenges suddenly stressful and difficult. This increase in vulnerability goes counter to the power-trip most other games makes you go through, and that alone, I found it to be really cool (as well as REALLY nerve-wrecking as I faced old enemies).That being said, this is not a fighting game per se. Sure, the fights are the parts that require most eye-hand coordination and skill, but the puzzle solving and exploration take a similar toll in your brain. I found it very balanced how much emphasis it was put onto each part of the gameplay.Oh, another thing I liked: At the end of each ""chapter"" the narrator takes you back to the main screen, telling you to take a break before continuing. I found this to be cool in terms of story-telling, and oddly considerate for you as a player. It made me wish more games would suggest that kind of pauses for their players.So overall, this is a very strange, charming, deep, stressfull and rewarding game all at once. It's a bit short compared to other titles, but by the end, you'll be glad by every minute of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SB: S&S: EP has you play as a character bent on vanquishing their world of evil, with the almighty power of the Megatome and the Trigon.The game is interesting in that the methods of play aren't conventional, and it at intervals actually requests you take a break, so that you come back and appreciate it more. Which I did, and I really feel it added to the experience.It's a point-and-click puzzle solving game, which took me 5.5 hours to complete (including all 14 achievements). A delightful little story filled with a lot of style, and a distinct impressive of the creator's personality. And, of course, a remarkable soundtrack.A lot of people will already have this from the Humble Bundle, for those who haven't, I'd recommend the game heartily.-Nilesy			",313,139,3,47,47,5,46

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is not just a game, it's an experience.With a mix of beautiful visuals and an amazing soundtrack, this game delivers a very unique and interesting point & click adventure. This includes poetic fantasy storytelling.This game is simply a piece of art in itself, but that's exactly what might turn other people away from this game.It's best played to relax. Some might say it plays slow and repetitive, but I'm pretty easy with those kind of things because I don't mind taking my time. If you're bored quickly, you might not enjoy this game as much.This game definitely has a special place in my library because it's strange in it own ways. It made me love it! The game is, what the devs called, a mythic little realm. That's exactly how it felt like.			",176,27,1,17,10,0,12

												This is an Indie puzzle game that has a lot to offer, including atmosphere and music, but it is held back by a couple of issue. Firstly, it's slow. You will spend more time walking around than you will solving puzzles. Secondly, there's a combat system that isn't complex, but it is repetitive. That said, it is definitely worth the $8 it costs to buy and getting it on a Steam sale is a great deal.			",122,50,0,26,19,3,20

												A game ahead of its time, Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP is a point-and-click (and drag, and listen, and what-have-you) adventure game. It was designed as an experiment to see how social media and gaming interact with one another. The quirky 2nd person narration and access to twitter make the game feel as if you're traveling with the main character to complete her woeful errand. It's very slow to start, but the game becomes very suspenseful towards the end and you'll be glad you've stuck with it if you make it that far.Perhaps this revitalization of the Adventure Game genre is ahead of its time and not easily understood by the more impatient or less educated, but I found it to be a magical story. I went in curious as to what this game was (I received it with Humble Indie Bundle 5), and came out with a heavy heart. The emotion at the end really struck me. Jim Guthrie did an amazing job on the Soundtrack and Capybara Games did amazing with the animation and beautiful minimalist visuals.			",255,55,0,39,20,4,27

I suppose it shows life in a shortened version and what everyone wants to try and be. We all want to be the hero, but as some people know, there can be no hero without sacrafice and suffering. The soundtrack to this game compliments the graphics perfectly setting a brilliant atmosphere of being tense and relaxed at the same time.As a side note this isn't a game, it's a journey and you will never forget this journey.""If you want to treat yourself to an audio/visual treat, definitely try it out on Steam"" -mightier tumblrNow we're cosmic friends forever ...ok?

												This is a tablet game. The gameplay is minimal since it’s mostly about getting a relaxed feeling as you try to figure out where to touch on the screen. The characters and dialog is charming and funny at start but soon becomes obnoxious. It’s like hearing someone being sarcastic, constantly. It’s fun as balls to begin with but soon you get the point and wish to move on. The fights is again clearly made for touchscreen. The look is nice as well to begin with but never stops using only brown and green. The story is okay but told in an uninteresting way. I did like that there was no playing favorites on sexes. It feels good when you’re not taken out of the game because 96% of the npc:s are male and/or so forth. If I had a tablet then maybe I could tell you this is good for that. This game gets boring fast though. Keep your distance, is a sentence I would like to fuse to this game.PS: works on LINUX!			",40,7,0,8,1,0,4

												I've finished the chapter 2 (so I'm technically midway through), and the game is so bland. It's also very obscure: it doesn't lead you  appropriately, explicitly or implicitly.There aren't a lot of fights, but when there are it's the most awful thing ever. The fighting itself isn't bad, in fact it's minimalist and I love it, but if you die in a boss fight (some attacks kill you instantly), you have to start from the beginning of the fight. It's always the same sequence, so it becomes partly a game of memorization. Also, while I turned it off, what's up with the tweets? Apart from marketing purposes, why did they include it in this game? This feels so out of place. I'm mixed toward the dialogues and narration. Maybe I'll make up my mind when I'll have finished the game (if that happens someday).So far, the only good thing is the soundtrack, but I don't find it extraordinary like most people seem to do.

												I like this game, but in the same way I like the coffee I get from the coffeeshop I frequent in the mornings before work. Its not a masterpeice, but its good enough.Its essentially a point and click with some boss fights, those boss fights introduce some random mechanics that you don't really use in the game, that has a very quirky and slightly off nature about it.This game gets a lot of praise for its music and art style, which I think might be a bit much. I definately don't hate it, but I just feel that its good enough, its definately not good enough to be able to use the music as a selling point in my opinion.Want to see me say the same thing about this game again?

												Note: I played this on Android, and so a lot of what I say here is specific to playing on a mobile device. I would definitely recommend playing on mobile as opposed to PC, as it was clearly built with that form factor in mind.As the name suggests, Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is a bit of a musical experiment wrapped up in a video game. Records (or Big Black CDs as I used to call them) show up with some frequency in the game as little reminders to pay attention to the awesome sounds being gently pushed into your ear canals. I enjoyed the music so much that I went and bought the soundtrack.Most of the visuals are very simple, very 16-bit. But every once in a while there is something that is nice and smooth. These objects usually don't belong with the rest of their surroundings, and the difference in visual style helps to emphasize that sense of alienation.Despite the fact that the visual style is very pixelated, there were quite a few moments that just took my breath away. The best part about them is that I didn't see them coming, so the awe factor was even greater.Most of the game is spent with the device in landscape, and you walk around by either holding down on the spot you want your character to walk to, or you double-tap there.However, when you rotate the device into portrait, she will unsheathe her sword and prepare for battle. Obviously whenever there is an enemy nearby this is what you want to do.The combat always follows the pattern of ""tap the shield when your enemy is going to attack"" until ""your enemy is vulnerable, tap the sword."" Each enemy has different patterns to them (usually the music gives you a hint at what that pattern is) so you have to stay on your toes. The boss battles are really intense, especially if you make a couple of mistakes at the beginning and can't afford to get hit when it gets really crazy. I'm pretty sure that I got more than a few weird looks while I was sitting in the TV lounge yelling at my tablet that it wouldn't defeat me.In between the battles there are quite a few puzzles. The hints are often very cryptic, but they are always enough to get you going in the right direction and once you have started the rest just kind of follows.The tone of the game is hard to describe, as it has several parts that almost conflict. The game is very meta, and makes references to the fact that you are outside of the game world affecting the events inside the game world. It also has a great sense of humor, and is often very frank with its jokes. At the same time it is very serious, and you are always aware that the events that are taking place cannot lead to a happy ending.The game, while being very story-driven, is also very easy to digest in small chunks. This is very important in  a mobile game. The chapters are not too long, and they make sure to remind you what is going on at the beginning of each one.			",216,87,1,26,10,3,40

												I'm always left confused by these types of games. I'm unsure wheter there's a stroke of brilliance that I'm not seeing or if it's just pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥y. There is some definite laziness in a way touch sensitive controls were transfered to mouse and keyboard, but it's functional enough for solving games rudimental puzzles and barely interactable combat.Pixel art, in-game music and audio effects are all pretty enough, but I wasn't sufficently impressed to sing odes to Mr. Jim Guthrie whose name features so prominently in this game.There is some optional twitter interaction which I haven't tried since I'm of opinion that video games shouldn't cater to any other form of media. Overall, too esoteric for my tastes, but maybe you'll like it. Check it out before you buy.			",294,114,2,34,23,2,39

												This game is like a haiku: some people get it, others don't, but even if you understand it that doesn't meant you'll like it.The artistic graphics are truly beautiful and the music is really good and immersive but there are some things that I particularly don't enjoy: the story is sometimes confusing, there are only a few areas that you must walk back and forth over and over, the difficulty is unbalanced (the game is a cakewalk until you fight a boss and must learn its moves straightaway), the twitter integration doesn't report any benefits, the conversations between characters are cryptic and written on royal ""we""...The worse thing IMO is its major praise: the lunar phases system. I'm ok about waiting real-life time when it comes to mobile games (e.g. to replenish my lives), in fact the Steam version is merely a port of the iOs version, but I can't stand when I can't play a PC game whenever I want. Sure, you can cheat your computer clock to advance in the game but that just feels wrong (you'll get an achievement for it, though). You can also change the moon using a key that is hidden in the game but not all people will find it.			",884,281,31,96,56,12,122

												Finished my first ""run"" of around 10 minutes, and I was told to take a break by the game. I think I'll make it a permanent one. Almost everything about this game annoyed me. Self-aware presentation, infatuation with its own soundtrack, intentionally oversimplified yet obtuse menus, twitter integration (?), and fantasy theme inexplicably presented with God-awful ""'sup bro"" narration. Undertale did half of these things better without the horrible mobile game controls.			",641,187,27,123,56,1,91

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Superbrother’s: Sword & Sworcery EP. Journey Through a Quirky Audiovisual ExperienceGenre: 2D Point & Click AdventureDeveloped & Published by: Capybara GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Mobile.Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsAt its core, Superbrothers is a 2D point and click adventure game. You click on places to move, try to find objects to help you progress and experience a story mainly told through the music and pixelart. Said pixelart is a very dense affair and can take some getting used to. Combat is handled in a 1v1 mini-game where you need to time your attacks or defense with what the enemy is doing. It’s ok, a bit annoying but otherwise harmless and you, thankfully, won’t encounter it too often. The game is on the short side, clocking in at about four hours but I felt I got my monies worth. Story ThoughtsThe game follows the adventures of a Scythian and her adventures in locating a mysterious object called the “Megatome”. She is nameless and her past is unknown. Well, that goes for most everyone you’ll encounter. There’s not a learning about pasts, just experiencing the here and now. You interact with a few people in the game, but the game mostly focuses on exploring the world and trying to find objects as you go through it. There are a few occasions where you’ll fight a wolf and an object known as the Golden Trigon but they’re few and far between. The game also likes to insert amusing jokes and references as well as break the fourth wall. Overall, the story is fairly ok.Difficulty ThoughtsThe puzzles weren’t too bad on difficulty, so long as you could figure out how the game wanted you to interact with it. There is a bit of a learning curve to the controls, especially if you’re new to the genre. While there was the occasional puzzle that could be difficult to solve, I managed to get by most of them just fine. They usually require you to move your mouse in a certain way or click on the right places of the screen in the right order. Sometimes the game can be frustrating because it won’t clue you in on whether you’re trying to solve the puzzle correctly so that can lead to a lot of brute force guessing. PC Settings and Port ReportIt made the port to PC rather reasonably but it’s still missing quite a bit. What it does have, is a plentiful amount of resolution options, fullscreen on/off, Twitter integration (though I have my doubts this works anymore) and a single volume slider. It would have been nice to see multiple audio sliders and the ability to configure graphics. The game handles itself well on both the desktop and mobile devices though I think the touch experience is preferred. Though, I doubt you’ll really feel like you're missing anything when using the mouse. There weren’t any serious porting issues reported and the game didn’t have any major bugs or crashes when I gave it a go. The visuals presented in Superbrothers are a rich and dense pixelart design and are quite interesting to look at. Combined with the atmospheric chiptune/electronic soundtrack, it really creates a unique experience as you travel through the levels. Final ThoughtsPoint and clicks like Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery are a mixed bag for me. I always seem to get really intrigued by the concept but the execution doesn’t always gel with me. Sure, the game was oddly engaging for me when I first played it back in 2012 and I think it still holds up now. I also won’t deny that a lot of the homages/references to the Legend of Zelda series probably helped me enjoy this game more than I normally would. That said, the combat is pretty lacking and it can feel like the game is being unnecessarily obtuse at times. Puzzles can be confusing or downright frustrating, requiring you to force brute them or look up hints online. Which I’ve found is pretty typical of minimalist point-and-clicks like these. It’s why I don’t like playing them too often. As for Superbrothers, I still think it’s worth giving a go if you’re into this genre or want an introduction to it.

												When you first fire up Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP, you are greeted by a mysterious cigar smoking figure with the following introduction:""We are profoundly grateful that you have chosen to participate in this experimental treatment for acute soul-sickness.""That's as good an indication as any that this isn't your average run of the mill entertainment. While the core gameplay matches that of a classic 2D point and click adventure, the distinct elements that feed the whole are original and uniquely charming and the sum of their parts makes for an experience that is quite unlike anything else.You will be presented with the option to tweet the messages that pop up throughout your quest, and as hinted at earlier, I guess this is meant to function as an experiment in social networking and provide real time feedback and meta-commentary while you play. It's a novel way of integrating real world social networks and to my knowledge hasn't been attempted before in this medium in such fashion. This is a game that isn't afraid to be self-conscious and sometimes poke fun at itself and at what it is trying to achieve. The ironic tone of the dialogue makes this clear from the onset, and although I enjoyed the wry wit and humour on display, there were times when I couldn't help but think what might have been if the developers hadn't felt the need to abruptly break the fourth wall so often and had taken this wonderful thing they had created at face value and just ran with it. Because there is real magic to be found here. While playing Sword & Sworcery, I'm reminded once again that aiming for fidelity in computer generated graphics can be something of a double-edged, well, sword. While there's something to be said for games that push polygons to their limits and dazzle and awe with their polished ""cinematic realism"", what the developers of S&S EP have achieved with simple 2D sprites and pixelated lo-fi is nothing short of... magical. Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is, without a doubt, one of the most beautifully designed and evocatively atmospheric games I have ever witnessed. The visual beauty and artistry of the visual landscape never ceases to fascinate.It can't be stated often enough that a huge part of what gives the game its one-of-a-kind otherworldly feel is the stellar work of musical genius Jim Guthrie. The hauntingly atmospheric music and brilliantly minimalist sound design make this wonderful mystical world come to life. Sometimes, while wondering around, I would just stop and not do anything at all and just look and listen and just try to soak it all in.But of course there's more to this whole strange and fantastic adventure, there's a mystery to be solved, secrets to be uncovered, moon phases to be observed, hidden things to be clicked on, places to be discovered, monsters to be fought, and a story to be told and experienced and remembered and cherished. I can't but recommend Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP in the strongest terms. It's a wonderful thing to behold.			",1018,376,57,139,100,8,183

												A lovely-looking game that plays like a point-and-click adventure, but instead of arcane inventory puzzles, you get some fairly simple combat and some pretty straightforward environmental puzzles.I really enjoyed the overal atmosphere of the game, from the art style and the music to the narrative, and I appreciated that the gameplay was simple and accessible. There's some weirdness in the game being a mobile port, particularly when it comes to the fact that your mouse cursor is accompanied by a big dimming area on the screen, but it's mostly just a minor oddity. A few mechanics things could do with some more explaining, but otherwise it was pretty accessible (hold up your shield in combat for a while to heal; some of the puzzles require you to enter combat mode without an opponent and either hit things or hold up your sword; a few other things).I enjoyed the setting - it's a weird, mythical Caucasus, where the characters talk in remarkably modern and kind of hipsterish/ironic ways (which I actually thought was quite entertaining, but might throw some people off). The one thing I didn't enjoy was the weird meta-narrative, though - there's a man in a suit who appears in interludes, and seems to talk to the player directly as a separate character from S&S's protagonist. I don't really understand the point of that element, and would have been fine with the rest of the game's simple story on its own.Overall - it's aesthetically pleasing, accessible, interesting, and doesn't overstay its welcome. Try it out!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sure, I could say how this game is faux-artsy and contrived. How it's only strong point is that it's able to beat the player over the head with a bludgeon that has the names of every crap artist out there on it; but considering everyone seems to love SuperBrothers Steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'd like to just say a few words.This game is the most boring 'game' I've ever played, and I made it 3 hours into Little Inferno. But at least Little Inferno tried shoving it's moral down your throat like some highschool boy on prom night. Superbrothers Swords and Sharks was just plain boring. There was no substance, nothing to hold you to the game. It droned on and on and on, trying to point something out to you but I had no idea what the hell it was trying to say. It might've been saying, ""Hey, isn't integration with social media sites a great thing?"" And if it was, it would be wrong. Because it's not. It's tedious and annoying. Now, I've played flash games like this. With the whole blocky, pixel art style and the clicking and the music; but SuperSorcerer and the Goblet of Swordcraft was just plain terrible. Not only do they expect people to shell out $8 for this, but it's a terrible port from a bloody tablet. And if that's not enough, people are actually praising it! I just don't get it. Don't buy it. Save yourself. Buy something good. Buy a book.EDIT: On Gametime, I made it less than an hour in. It was hard, damnit. I tried. I really did. I wanted to like it because everyone else did. But nope. It's impossible. I just went and read Dune.			",419,72,5,48,40,4,46

												Good pixel art and music. That's all this game has going for it. Not great either, just good.Beyond that, you have several negative points you'll be frustrated by constantly. The controls are really bad. I know this game was designed first for a touchscreen interface, but even with that in mind, they were done wrong. No other touchscreen game I've played has had you *double-click* to do your primary action. Hell, most don't even make you do it for alternate actions. Do you want to wear out your finger or mouse? Now you can!The game world is also really vague in how its levels are layed out, and how they look visually. This means that you'll be backtracking constantly, because you forgot which way was ""forward"" and which was back where you just came from. This wouldn't be so bad by itself, but it combines with the aforementioned bad controls, and the slow movement, to make the simple act of moving around a grinding chore.The nail in the coffin is all of the self-referential, condescending, pretentious dialog and writing of the game. It constantly feels like you're talking to that one ""artist"" you met at a party. You know the one. When you ask them what they do, they talk about how ""quirky and random their life journey has turned out. LoL!"" When you ask them what their art is about, they say ""Everyone brings their own interpretation!""Do not buy this game.			",150,50,0,11,12,2,25

												A highly entertaining game, both visually and audibly. Its a game where you can enjoy exploring and seeing the world while you're progressing, and it leaves very little fluff in terms of exploration, just about every area in the game is important in some way at some point. The dialogue and character interactions are also great, and they're presented in an interesting way that makes the game feel more like a story. The game can be finished in about 2 hours but it offers the option to pace yourself, which I highly recommend to enjoy the game like a series of snacks. I played it on an iPad first and found it much more intuitive to control using the touchscreen interface. Nonetheless, you can play this with a mouse and keyboard with no problem (I used a touchpad for my second playthrough and it was fine)			",253,33,7,15,11,3,27

												The control scheme here is mouse-only and feels designed for mobile platforms. The game lengthens little aspects like screen transitions and expositional dialogs for what seems like the purpose of masking a lack of content. Given that the graphics aren't exactly cutting edge, it feels like the game's price should really be closer to a mobile app.Having said that, what's here is done well. If adventure games are your thing, there's something a bit fun and unique to be had here. However, I suspect this game is more suitable for big fans of this particular genre. If adventure games and/or point & click games don't top your list of games, you can probably safely skip this one.This is one of those games where I wish I could give more than a yes or no. 6/10.

												What the hell is this!!?!?Just glad it was 2$! Sucha waste of money though. This ain't my sort of game and I really should have watched a video or something before buying this game impulsively! Oh well, the soundtrack is... not bad at least! Visuals are very old school retro style and they can grow on you if retro games are your sort of thing!But that kind of game truly ain't my thing and for the little amount played, there was already some running back and forth to do x-y-z thing. I read other reviews and looks like this game is filled with running back and forth to progress. That's cheap game extension and I hate games doing that!Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this game anyway!			",800,167,27,82,79,2,130

What it is:Superbrothers: Swords & Sorcery is a 2D platform-style point & click adventure game with a few elements of action. The emphasis is mostly on the puzzles.The good:This game has undeniably a good soundtrack that really enhances the mood. The pixelated graphic is well done with a great attention to details and smooth animations. If you don’t mind this style it’s definitely in the good end of pixelated games.A somewhat interesting way of telling its story (kinda good but not really).The bad:Sadly good sound and interesting art style is not enough to have a good game, and sadly this is the only thing this game really has going for it…The fighting mechanics are neither interesting nor good. Fighting seems pointless most of the time.The puzzles are just uninteresting – subjective yes, but that’s how I felt.You spend an eternity just walking…The dialogue is *sigh* not good. To say the least.You’ll spend a lot of time just walking.You are being encouraged to connect to twitter to spam your progress.You spend a lot of time walking through empty screens.Conclusion:I simply did not have fun while playing. Engaging gameplay should always be the main focus of any game, but Sword & Sorcery just fell flat. Action? Puzzles? It didn’t really excel in any area.I was glad when the game actually told me to quit after completing the first chapter. I cried when it told me to come back later…In short:Not super bad, but kinda boring. Definitely overrated. 3/10			",193,19,5,13,9,2,32

This is a rather long review, so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is clearly a tablet game; something that if you don't know before going in will really make you sour. Story:Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery is the story of a gender ambiguous character that embarks on a mission to bring peace to the land. An evil monster has arisen after the powerful tome was taken from its castle. As you progress through your epic quest you learn to realize how great a toll is put upon a true hero. The world twists and turns around you and the sounds of nature great a lullaby. You must fight to collect the trigons of power and assemble to force necessary to defeat the evil that has plagued the land.Campaign:The game is interesting and offers a mixture of sounds, visuals, and thoughts that create an absorbing atmosphere. The landscape repeats itself, as there are only about 20-25 different screens (this is a rough estimate). Some of these screens you only go to once, so realistically you run through the same 10-15 most of the time going backward and forward. You play as a character (of some gender) and go through their adventure defeating evil from the land; rather a basic adventurer’s tale is it not? But what really makes the story great is how the world unfolds in front of you drawing you in through the lore of the land. The tome which you find at the beginning allows you  to read into the thoughts and feelings of those around you. Giving you a sense of understanding and wonder of how you are viewed by your friends, colleagues, and pet. Gameplay:The combat system is deficient as it is definitely optimized for two fingers. In order to initiate a “defend” or “attack” command you must move the cursor from one button on the screen to another and click. Moving the mouse and clicking the commands can be rather difficult in high stress boss fights. Most of the fights are simple and even the boss fights are not too tough, but when you lose against a boss you have to watch the fight animation all over again. It would be similar to watching Goku charge all the way to Super Sayan then the VHS losses track and you have to start all over again. The first time the charge up is awesome, but if you have to watch it two times in a row its infuriating. The soundtrack and imaginative story is what makes this game. Quests:The quests can be rather annoying, and a few times I had to look online for guides because the game wants you to click random patterns to solve a mystery without any hints on how the pattern would look. True I could have sat there for 20 minutes and figured it out, but that is just a waste of time. Results:Minus some of the elementary problems with the game, its interesting approach to a RPG/Arcade game. Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery pulls you through with a rather interesting story and mystical element that makes you wonder the whole time what will happen next. Pulling on your emotions and your curiosity this game is definitely an interesting and play-worthy game. Just make sure you understand when you get in that this game that it was designed as a tablet game. I recommend this game, but only if you can get it for a good price. I personally wouldn’t buy this unless it was 75% or more off. Waiting for a sale may seem frugal, but l on the itunes/play marketplace this game is $4.99, meaning that the $7.99 cost on Steam is way above what it should be.Pros:+The soundtrack, the music really builds up the atmosphere of this game.+The story is at first a mystery that unravels to leave you wanting more.+Characters and environment really run together.+Its broken up into good length chapters.+Incorporation of character thoughts allows you to really delve into the stories of the people.+Not mentioned, but the dog which guides you through your adventure was a very good concept. Cons:-Games playable areas are very few and overused.-Fighting is not designed for computers, and thus requires you to click buttons on a screen (when they could have easily incorporated two physical buttons in order to use the fighting commands).-There are very few settings and customization options.-Boss fights have way too long of animations.

												If it's on sale, buy without hesitation!  If not... I still recommend it, but you should know that it's quite short!  That said, this game is high quality escapism and does have replay value (though I haven't done it yet and may not for some time).  It creates an engrossing world, pulls you in further with the great music--then keeps you there with its charm and a story that ends up...  Well, I don't want to spoil it.  I'll just say this: there were two moments in the last quarter of the game where I stared at the screen, wide-eyed, slack jawed, and said, ""........ Well, damn.""			",22,5,0,1,1,0,0

Forced manner of speaking in the text, a very heavy feel of condescension as if it's a very deep and big philosophical game or something when they say things like ""keep calm & carry on"", the narrator says ""amirite?""  and everyone says ""dude"" all the time, the fact the narrator tries to get you to tweet the game... I guess I could chalk it up to ""hipster ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t""?The songs are more ambience than song, the pixel are style is uninteresting, the walking and combat are both just a distraction and take too long, and then some.

												Certainly not a bad adventure game by any means. A bit archaic in some of its puzzles. Has a tone that sort of requires you to play along with how some of the dialogue is delivered, and is pretty charming when you do. Pretty fricking neat visuals. Can be a bit emotionally gripping, but not in a way that makes you feel alienated if you don't get into it, not in a way like someone who starts crying in a public place and you don't know how to react because this sort of thing doesn't happen often and you don't have context or empathy for what's going on, more in a way like a nice dog on the street does something cute and if you notice than it's like the dog did it just for you but if you don't notice the dog doesn't make you feel weird for not getting involved in its escapades.Also theres a naked dancing bear.

												A simple point & click adventure turns out to be a bit more complex than it first appears. What you can do at any given point in the game is based on the current phase of the moon, but we're talking phases of the moon as they are measured in the real world, based on our system clock. Because of that this three hour game could potentially become fragmented across an entire month! Fortunately there are a couple ways around this. One is a secret mechanism built into the game that still lets you finish the game honestly, while the other is a click away but will get you a nice achievement tagging you as a cheater. Sword & Sworcery gives off a very dark and mysterious feeling and the great soundtrack helps set the mood along with the beautifully done pixel graphics. There are only a handful of battles in the game which are simple QTE, and the slang dialogue feels completely out of place.  Worth at least trying for something fresh.

												A game meant to be played for its music. The sound in this game is good and the music captures the atmosphere. There are a few quirky characters with some funny dialogue.There are several issues with game. The graphics are bad (ie. 2D pixle style), however that might have been due to the art direction that was chosen. The gameplay is simple and bland as you just click with the mouse to move,attack and select stuff. The storyline isn't that memorable either. You don't get to go to different towns (ie you just switch between a mundane dreamworld and a forest) or get different weapons (ie. all you get is sword and shield).If you like point and click games then this game is alright, else stay clear!

It's got the classical feel of a traditional rpg with some breaking of the fourth wall to show you it really doesn't take its self too seriously.

												I just got to play this game in 2016 and let me tell you, it's probably the best game I've played this whole year and last year combined. I've been gaming for +25 years and I've played dozens upon dozens of indie games in the past years but SB:S&SEP is probably one of the most deeply affecting and wonderful experiences I've ever had with a video game such as this. Jim Guthrie has outdone himself with the music and the Superbrothers are freaking legends of game design in my book from now on. This game has made me laugh out loud, tear up and feel deeply connected to every single character inside its little charming story. If you don't know much about philosophy, psychology and the esoteric, some of the game's subliminal nods and messages will fly right over your head and may leave some confused. For me, the game was deeply reflective and had so many things going on with its symbology and aesthetic choices that I sometimes felt quite overwhelmed with beauty to be quite honest. I just had to pause and take it all in. Especially that magnificent ending. Nothing short of a masterpiece. If you don't play this or can't like this, I'd rather not know you in real life at all. (PRO TIP: You can use the Z and X keys as replacements for the left and right mouse buttons in battle mode. That should make things much more manageable with the bosses)			",500,214,5,52,27,2,32

												If you believe that after 30 + years of video games that we should by now have reached a little further beyond the realms of aimless manshoots, then this, this my friend, is the game you should try. A profoundly beautiful and delightful game, that compels you to unshackle yourself from other gaming concepts that you have become tangled up in, and embrace it's delightful simplicity. PLAY THIS.

												I just got to play this game in 2016 and let me tell you, it's probably the best game I've played this whole year and last year combined. I've been gaming for +25 years and I've played dozens upon dozens of indie games in the past years but SB:S&SEP is probably one of the most deeply affecting and wonderful experiences I've ever had with a video game such as this. Jim Guthrie has outdone himself with the music and the Superbrothers are freaking legends of game design in my book from now on. This game has made me laugh out loud, tear up and feel deeply connected to every single character inside its little charming story. If you don't know much about philosophy, psychology and the esoteric, some of the game's subliminal nods and messages will fly right over your head and may leave some confused. For me, the game was deeply reflective and had so many things going on with its symbology and aesthetic choices that I sometimes felt quite overwhelmed with beauty to be quite honest. I just had to pause and take it all in. Especially that magnificent ending. Nothing short of a masterpiece. If you don't play this or can't like this, I'd rather not know you in real life at all. (PRO TIP: You can use the Z and X keys as replacements for the left and right mouse buttons in battle mode. That should make things much more manageable with the bosses)			",500,214,5,52,27,2,32

												This is one of the most insightful games I've ever played. It's not too long and the controls are easy to master. Boss battles can be punishing but follow the theme of the game. It's got the classical feel of a traditional rpg with some breaking of the fourth wall to show you it really doesn't take its self too seriously. The music is enchanting and in a way, plays a significant role in the story. It's not going to be a top seller, but this game is well worth checking out.			",62,37,2,17,5,1,6

												The problem with the game at first is the controls when playing on the pc. Once you get the hang of the controls and understand the basis of the puzzles with Sworcery, this game can be understandable. Beautiful background interface, which proves that no matter how many bits and pixels, graphics can be beautiful. What also adorns with the graphics is the sound effects and music once progressing through the game. A little serious, little witty story. Regardless of a few hard puzzles and some stiff controls, this remains a Pixelated Masterpiece that you must have in your library of games.			",569,356,11,81,63,6,65

												An interesting game, to be sure- the presentation tells you exactly where to take a break so you don't get burned out, which is neat- even though I ignored it completely- and the audiovisual presentation of the puzzles requires you to think outside of the usual point-and-click box. Having said that, the first few sworcery puzzles could easily dissuade the average player: trying to solve them as you would most other games leads inevitably to randomly clicking objects in the environment until you get them in the right order. It's not an ""experience"" like it's clearly trying to be, but it's worth a playthrough.			",141,91,2,27,16,3,40

Someone deserves to have a couple of fingers cut off for this.In the end, I get the feeling that ten years from now, the people who's name are on the credits for this title are going to have something both to be proud of, and something to regret.Go read the negative reviews and count the use of the word “pretentious”.

												6/10 This game is special. I like the artistic style and concept of of this game. But the pacing is too slow for my taste. I picked this game up after a long pause and was aimlessly and slowly walking around for quit some time bevore I found out how to enter the dreamworld again. Progress is dependend on the moonphase in RL, which means you will have to wait for weeks (or months if you miss the full moon) until you can progress, if you don't care enough to change your system clock (which even is suggested by the cheating cheater ingame). Even ingame characters died because of boredom while waiting for the moonphase to change.. If you like slow paced and artistic games, give it a shot. But I would not recommend it for everyone. And get the tablet version if possible. It's a bit awkward to play on PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 A very simple game in terms of mechanics, but very satisfying for its sounds and noises. I would more rate this as a playable EP - liked listening to Jim Guthrie. The hardest sections of the game is where you need to react in step with the ambient music - it's a blast if you knock it all over without being hit (although really one should go play rock band if rhythm is your thing). Other than that, there's the scavenger hunt. So, a recommndation for a number of relaxed evenings. The honest player won't finish the game in one sitting.			",66,21,0,6,15,0,39

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP was a wonderful game for me.  The game has a unique story that makes you wonder many things yet also is quite casual at the same time. The puzzles aren't too difficult, but no so simple it's lain straight before you. Tthe game is not entirely too long either, so time vs money it may not be worth this price. However, this game has an absolutely beautiful soundtrack with good ambience to it and is very relaxing. If you can get this at a good price and enjoy a unique ambient/casual story. I'd recommend it.			",145,35,3,20,13,1,18

												A slow paced point-and-click adventure with side-scroller elements, I'll be the first to admit that this probably isn't the game for everyone. But I love it.Reasons I love it? - killer soundtrack. Seriously, even if you don't want to play this game, pull up the OST and give it a listen. It's one of my favorite soundtracks to listen to while I study or write papers.- the dialogue is hilarious. I've read a lot of reviews which pit the writing as pretentious hipster nonsense, but I just don't see it. The game got more than a few chuckles out of me. I mean, two of the characters you encounter first are Dogfella (a dog) and Logfella (a lumberjack).  I dunno, it tickled me senseless.  - the Grizzled Boor. This guy is a nut, seriously how do you guys come up with this♥♥♥♥♥♥lol. Uh uhuh uh uh uh.- the pixel art style is deadly. The first couple of times I loaded up the game I distinctly remember letting out a few involuntarily audible moans of ""cooooooool"" - the gameplay and puzzles are directly tied to the actual phases of the moon. THE MOON. How neat is that? The entire game should, in theory, take you at least a full lunar cycle to complete. That is, unless you can come up with some way to alter the moon's phases yourself, you cheater.- the combat is easy-going, which may or may not appeal to you. It's all personal preference, you know?- the puzzles were challenging, but not impossible. Once you get into the rhythm of the game a bit the solutions will come easier to you. I'm a huge puzzle nerd though. - great for touch-screen devices, if you're into that.- it's refreshing to have a female lead, honestly. She's just trying to complete her woeful errand, you know, doing her own thing, being a heroine and such.  Overall, I'd have to say this is one of the quirkiest games I've ever played, and I sincerely hope you like it as much as I have.			",26,49,2,11,1,0,3

												Art, it’s a subjective thing. Whether a painting is a masterpiece or just some colour on  canvas is entirely up to debate. As is whether video games can ever be considered art?Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP is art, plain and simple. It’s stunning, it’s gorgeous, it’s moving, it gets down to the bottom of your heart and invokes the deepest levels of emotion. Happiness, sadness, loneliness, fear, these are the feelings that have stuck with me after the completion of the Scythian’s woeful errand.And what an errand it was. Sword and Sworcery doesn’t really explain much. You’re a Scythian, you’re on a quest of some kind, you wake up in a forest and are pretty much left to figure out the rest by yourself. The game presents its story through messages that are all less than 140 characters. It’s all very self-aware, quite humorous stuff and it’s what sets the tone of the game, lighthearted, but with serious undertones. To say more would spoil the journey. ",462,175,17,86,48,3,75

I guess it's meant to be 'minimalist' but it's just unclear and irritating.The gameplay is minimal and yet I still had to look up a walkthrough to work out what to do. I stopped playing the game previously and decided to restart (had to look up a walkthrough to work out how to delete my save), and I remembered I'd had to look up  walkthrough to work out what to do in the sworcery segments... and I still couldn't remember what to do and had to look it up a second time. On the plus side, the graphics and music are lovely. On the negative side, there are a load of 'empty' areas, which seem to exist purely to pad out gameplay while you walk back and forth. I haven't finished the game but the other reviews seem to indicate it will get worse.I gave up in the first Trigon combat. Apparently you can double click the shield to dodge... great thanks for letting me know game. Died twice, no great desire to go through all that again. Yawn.			",166,94,0,39,12,2,23

												Brilliant experimental adventure game.  The closest experience resembling it is Black & White. One of the best stress relievers, a meditation intended even for those who don't usually play games.   Top notch audio design, free soundtrack included - therapy for your soul  Works great on Android, controls are easy, puzzles are not hard if you have a little time and patience  The game runs well on old devices: PC and Android from what I've testedIt's hard to describe this in words, just because it's so unique! This is one of the best indie products of our time. The only downside is that the Twitter integration doesn't work, haven't gotten around to using it anyway.Such a videogame will be valued by  anyone who is emotional and who appreciates care from developers into aesthetics.

												Quirky game (and yes, a bit hipster-y...but not too much)  with an effective gimmick based on real world moon phase (literally there are only, I believe, 4 days in each real world month on which challenges can be completed).  Very enjoyable atmosphere and music.  I finished it on the full moon, dude.  Which was rad.  This limitation about when it's even possible attain certain goals actually made it more exciting for me.  It was like in the days before the Internet when you had to wait for your favorite song to come on the radio.  Somehow not being able to hear it whenever you wanted made it more special when you finally heard it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great game. This is a lovely ipad conversion of a short, amusing, yet subtly bleak fantasy tale. You play a girl who turns up in a forest, accidentally causes a bad thing to come about, and then must fix things, all the while getting to know the few people you're stuck in the forest with and your destiny. It's divided into four parts and carefully narrated by a mysterious archetype figure. He even suggests when you might have had enough by punctuating the end of each chapter with a sort of summary of events and a kind of 'until next time...' attitude. Even though the game is quite short, it's broken up into four of these easily digestible chapters. Having EP in the title, the music is obviously one of the centrepoints and Guthrie does a great job of stimulating an apt mood for the moment with some unusual synth tracks. There are things that might put people off - it's pixel-art, it's fairly slow going, sometimes the way to do some of the puzzles is a little obtuse, but the pace is important to setting the mood, the weird puzzles further fit with the unique nature of the game, and the humour is great, with regular comments from ""you"" and others that tend to look at situations sideways and often break the fourth wall. It's a lovely tale to see, hear and play and more people should experience the whole of this.			",715,305,14,50,65,4,97

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery, while linear, proves to be over-the-top and out-of-the-box.  While fitting into the pixelated art style that is becoming more popular by the minute, this game may be the only one to pull it off in such a gorgeous and vivid way.  Bright colors, unique environments, and the cute little creatures of the forest are all implemented perfectly and without excess noise to drown everything out.  The graphical content of this game never ceases to disappoint.  From a tiny village, to a waterfall going through the middle of the woods, and even a concert venue with a bear, Capybara makes everything work and keep you wanting more.Sword & Sworcery tells the tale from a Scythian woman’s point of view as she steals a tome and proceeds to fight a towering specter, numerous small triangles that form a larger triangle, and even that mysterious bear inside a tree that is much bigger on the inside. Using the tome to read your, and everyone else’s, thoughts from second person, this title provides a fun and humorous way to keep you coming back. While this game is short, it is split into sections.  To prolong this game, I recommend playing each session on a different day.  As short as it may be, Sword & Sworcery is a fantastic game with a wonderful soundtrack and is for anyone who likes adventure, pixel-art, art in general, or just having a good time.

												Hello!I've just finished this funny little game, and so I return here to write a small review.I've bought this one off the Steam-Sales, after reading about the concept of the game and seeing a few screenshots.Ever since then I've been keeping this game in mind. I've finished it without cheating (Which means it can only be finished over a timespam of min 15, max 29 days, in my case somewhat halfway).I must say, this game is neat, fun and it makes you wonder... In general :)I don't really want to spoil stuff for people who're looking for this game, but I can recommend it for 100%!The graphics are very mesmerizing, and same goes for the comments most of the characters make.It isn't overdone, it isn't underdone. It's witty, the concept is really simple, and result is really epic.The musical component is just as big as promised, with puzzles and possibilities in plenty.Go and get this.			",45,12,0,2,2,0,5

												Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP is a good game with questionable implementation.The game is a point-and-click adventure game with a heavy emphasis on music and stylistic pixel art graphics. The story is told more via a narrator character and through reading the minds of NPCs as opposed to through other means in the game. For a point and click adventure it's rather engaging, but more from an exploration perspective than from a plot perspective. The puzzles, by and large, can be a little obtuse, and the combat is simple. Some of the puzzles in the game involve the moon's phase (although there's an in-game shortcut which allows you to bypass having to wait for two weeks).Basically, I enjoyed this game, but at times it seemed like that was in spite of the game, not because of it. The mechanics and playstyle are probably better suited to a tablet (which I believe this game was originally for), but if you enjoy adventure games, it's probably a good purchase.

												I enjoyed playing Superbrothers, but it was the kind of game I only wanted to play for thirty minutes at a time. That might have more to do with the genre than the game itself, though.The best part is undoubtedly the music. The delivery is good too; just experiencing the world is half of what the game is. Visually it is hit and miss; the pixel art looks great however there are often parts that are too detailed and stand out for it, such as the sprites. And the combat reminded me of Quest for Glory, which I enjoyed. The game doesn't try to hold your hand too much, thankfully, but reading over the Megatome can always put you on the right path (and adds to the experience besides). What I didn't like was the very obvious touchpad controls. They work completely fine, but the game could have been made more enjoyable with better mouse control rather than just substituting the mouse pointer for a finger. Also the blatant twitter integration was groan-worthy... but I could accept it with the way they presented all of the dialogue.Ultimately I'd say that if you are interested in Superbrothers that you should try to catch it on sale. It is good, but completely skippable.			",194,44,0,53,18,0,40

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP finds its way easily into my list of favorite games.  I bought this as part of a Humble Bundle a couple of years ago and never played it due to distractions.  Now that I'm on vacation, I decided to take some time out to sit down and play some of the games I have in my Steam library but haven't actually played, or simply to play some games that I miss playing.The graphics are simple, but beautiful and the soundtrack is awesome.If you like beautiful games with very relaxed gameplay that focus more on ambiance and storytelling than action and tropes, give this one a shot. ﻿			",108,18,1,11,11,0,12

												This is a very unique and polished indie game. From booting up the game you can instantly tell it is going to be quite a different experience. Every aspect of this game feels very....indie. The music is indie, the art is indie, hell. its an indie game! The music is just fantastic. The game comes with the music files ready to be imported into itunes so if you this music is your cup of tea, you can listen to it on the go. The game takes moments to laugh at itself which I though was great and with the sparatic randomness, you never really know what to expect in the next area. The game is split up into 4 parts which makes it much easier to play through by making actual times for you to take breaks if you wish. Now the story is not entirely gripping and the barebones gamplay is not complex at all. The humor will make you smile and the purity of the game will make your smile wider. The boss fights can be somewhat frustrating but you will establish a rhythm and beat them in no time. You could buy this game for the soundtrack alone its so good. I give this game an 8/10 and a high recommendation to anyone who likes  indie games and games with a very unique artstyle. You will get your money's worth.			",122,28,0,8,7,1,17

												They say that less is more - that is exactly the case of S:S&S.""Simplified"" pixel graphics are executed in way that cannot be described by any other words but artistic and absolutely breathtaking.Storyline, while being in a sense simple, too, will soon absolutely capture all of your attention - and fantasy, I might add.Not to mention the mindblowing soundtrack that I could listen to for eternity, sympathetic humor (I feel like I need to make a point out of the fact that while the game knows how to be amusing, it also knows how to get properly grim), puzzles that are complicated just enough to confuze you for a little while, but not so much that you would end up battling them for weeks......all in all, wonderful adventure that you will gladly return to several times, just for the oh-so-strong feeling of pursuing actual quest and overcoming obstacles, obtaining power - and bearing the burden that comes with it.Absolutely brilliant. If only there were more games like that!WE WROTE A REVIEW AND WE FELT SUPERSMART ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As an added bonus, the music that accompanies the game, by Jim Guthrie, is perfect and purchasing the game off Steam grants you a free digital copy of it.			",251,205,8,43,52,2,66

												I have very little playtime on this on Steam because I already played it on iOS.  This game is atmospheric as heck, and really reminds me of Another World in some respects.  The art is glorious, as is the music.  The combat is very meh, but is not that common.  Just exploring around the world and trying to figure out bits of the story is enormously engaging enough.

												This is more of an experience that an actual game. Even though there is some gameplay, like a couple of battles, and puzzles to solve, you'll also spend a lot of the time walking through the world and interacting with it, without doing much. It's still, in my opinion, a recommendable experience, as I found it slightly relaxing; the soundtrack is great, and the story, although there isn't much of it, is quite good.

Some may argue the game is too slow paced that it isn't a true ""videogame"" but thats unfair who are they to say whats really a video game; the story has puzzles and great simple mechanics which make it challenging enough to keep you thinking and interested.

												I would recommend this game as long as you temper your expectations accordingly because while it's somewhat enjoyable it isn't the deep meaningful tale that the professional reviewers at IGN and Gamespot say it is.  The amazing music and beautiful scenery make for a great experience but the actual puzzles and gameplay elements are lackluster, and the story is dressed up to be something meaningful but its ultimately underwhelming in its execution. This is more of an audio and visual experience than a game and as long as you understand that it's very enjoyable.			",224,67,2,24,7,0,24

												I enjoyed playing Superbrothers, but it was the kind of game I only wanted to play for thirty minutes at a time. That might have more to do with the genre than the game itself, though.The best part is undoubtedly the music. The delivery is good too; just experiencing the world is half of what the game is. Visually it is hit and miss; the pixel art looks great however there are often parts that are too detailed and stand out for it, such as the sprites. And the combat reminded me of Quest for Glory, which I enjoyed. The game doesn't try to hold your hand too much, thankfully, but reading over the Megatome can always put you on the right path (and adds to the experience besides). What I didn't like was the very obvious touchpad controls. They work completely fine, but the game could have been made more enjoyable with better mouse control rather than just substituting the mouse pointer for a finger. Also the blatant twitter integration was groan-worthy... but I could accept it with the way they presented all of the dialogue.Ultimately I'd say that if you are interested in Superbrothers that you should try to catch it on sale. It is good, but completely skippable.			",194,44,0,53,18,0,40

												Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP is a good game with questionable implementation.The game is a point-and-click adventure game with a heavy emphasis on music and stylistic pixel art graphics. The story is told more via a narrator character and through reading the minds of NPCs as opposed to through other means in the game. For a point and click adventure it's rather engaging, but more from an exploration perspective than from a plot perspective. The puzzles, by and large, can be a little obtuse, and the combat is simple. Some of the puzzles in the game involve the moon's phase (although there's an in-game shortcut which allows you to bypass having to wait for two weeks).Basically, I enjoyed this game, but at times it seemed like that was in spite of the game, not because of it. The mechanics and playstyle are probably better suited to a tablet (which I believe this game was originally for), but if you enjoy adventure games, it's probably a good purchase.

												Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery EP is a short game by level design. There are 4 ""levels"" but each one has a set amount of time it might take. The first 2 levels are sort of short, but the third one is LONG, could take a whole lunar month to complete. This game is a point and click game as well, and the game has alot of character. You play a girl character, who has to go on a quest to retrieve some book, and once you get the book, all heck breaks loose. This game has a deep story, which might not be easy to understand at first. The visuals are great, all look great. There are so many visual elements in this game, it looks really fantastic. The audio is great too, done by a great muscian, and I actually purchased and burned the EP onto CD to listen to at home. The game can be challenging to find and figure out all the puzzles and levels, but this game is worth it, sort of short in terms of content, but like I said, if you don't cheat, it will take at least one lunar month to complete.

												This is an absolutely lovely game. The art is beautiful, the music is great, and the writing is clever and silly in just the right ways. This does things narratively that few games pull off well.Because it was a tablet game, the control scheme is different from what you'd expect in a point-and-click adventure game, but it works rather well. The puzzles are about exploration and observation, rather than lock-and-key logic and inventory management, which felt smooth and refreshing.Overall, it's a very pleasant, zen experience.The only complaint I have about it is how it pushes the social media angle.

												I have yet to finish this game, maybe even barely started it, partly due to so many other things going on, and partly due to it barely fitting the category of ""game.""  I can already recommend this however, but like everything it is clearly not for everyone.  Some will love it, some will hate it, some will like it a bit, and probably many will either never get into it and/or simply give up on it like I almost did, a few times.In many ways, it is more of art than game.  And understandably, the people that dislike this, seem to miss that point more often than not.  Chances are that you haven't played something like this before, and jumping into this can be more than overwhelming in various ways, depending on your expectations.  Your best bet, is to not expect anything, which can often be said about anything new, but it probably fits this more than usual.Despite the essentially awkward controls and playstyle (which may or may not apply to you,) it has a pull to it, so rarely found.  Simply keep in mind that without real hand-holding, it will guide you on the journey, with some goofy/witty commentary and tweetability, mixed among the stylistic approach at story-telling via multiple dynamic blendings and clashings of various types of art, music, characterization, and lore.It's an indie game from years ago, if you aren't up for the risk of adventure, get it on sale and enjoy it anyway, especially at your own pace.

												The following is from: http://ricepixel.blogspot.jp/2014/10/ss-superbrothers-sexual-satisfying.htmlI don't use twttier and this game's nudgings to do so weren't strong enough.  The game Swuperbwothers: Sword and Sworcery had a unique take on marketing by having a built in node one could tap to automatically tweet whatever was happening in the game to their twitter account.  To me it was more of a nuisance than anything else because I didn't care whether people knew I was playing the game or not.  Had there been a moment that I wanted everyone to know about then it would have been another story....but apparently there wasn't. Aside from the lackluster attempt to get me to advertise for them, the developers behind S:S&S did deliver in one promise they made at the beginning of the game: good sound and jazzy music.  This Jim Guthrie fellow made some solid tunes throughout the game.  Particularly I liked the tunes the flowed After each I defeated and retrieved each Trigon, while I was in the dream world during a full moon, and when the Gogolithic Mass chased me.The one aspect I was trying to explore while playing the game was the insatiable curiosity I had about how the entire dialog of the game reminded me of something a schmo would say while hanging with his other friend schmo.  There were modern colloquialisms, filler words, and then suddenly words that fit the context of the game.  After thinking about this for awhile I developed in my mind a voice that I imagined would speak this way in real life.  I imagined this voice would belong to someone who liked groups like Ben Folds Five, but also would watch episodes of Sesame Street simply because few people his age would do it.  A voice that grew up in the 90's with a tinge of modern hipster.  And then I heard this.  ALL MY ASSUMPTIONS WERE VALIDATED!That point aside, I also wondered if most artistic games share characteristics similar to conventional art in that if they reflect the personality of the designer then they will be much more popular (of course among people who find that personality type amiable).

												I had no idea what was going on while I was playing this game, spent most of my time randomly clicking on things. Kind of frustrating, maybe because I was expecting more from the game than just clicking on trees and sheeps and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Maybe I didnt give it enough time, but I'm pretty impatient. The fight scenes and being stuck in fight scenes just made me want to play less, especially when you die and have to wait for those animations all over again. Nope.Art and Music is pretty nice though - Its what drew me to the game in the first place.I Still do recommend it, especially if you're far more patient than I am.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the game lacks depth in characters but not in the world you play in or the music that was very well put together through out this beuatiful pixelated world. This game can even be loved by people who dont games!!  Very easy control: point n click all the way. the puzzel are intresting and pleasent to the eyes and ears. all around a great game just wish there was more story depth to the characters, at least the main character.

												A modern point-and-click adventure with fantastic pixel art and one of the most immersive soundtracks I have ever heard in a game.Puzzles make sense, exploration takes place in interesting settings, music and sounds are perfectly timed and appropriately themed, fighting is sparse but meaningful, the story is seen more than read, and the humor is witty and self aware.

												This game is the most fantastic game I have in my Steam Library. I revisit it every year to play through again. It only takes a few hours (over the course of a lunar cycle), but well worth the full price, which includes the soundtrack as well. Few games have good enough story and music to drive emotion, but Sword and Sworcery definitely does.			",163,65,2,56,15,2,12

												Simple click adventure game. Looks pretty good for a retro sprite game.  You play as a female hero who is trying to find these powerful relics sort of reminds me of a triforce from zelda, there are three of them. The game at first helps you in finding certain things.  But, later on it gets pretty hard and I end up bacially clicking the around the whole screen trying to find out what will respond to my clicking.  You sometimes get clues from the 2 people you meet or the ghost that you find. But it's sometimes pretty vague.  The sound track in this game is pretty decent and catchy.   The battle is simple as you respond by the game giving you cues sort of like a quick time event.  The game is very short but somewhat fun. If you're into a simple click adventure game give it a go.  The only con is that sometimes you need to go back in forth through out the map and that you dont really have a run speed to quickly move around.  I would recommend grabing this during a sale.

												An indie classic that plays by no rules. The I-Spy gameplay and mixed-media graphics blend into a mystical and incredibly self-aware storytelling experience, punctuated with S:S&S EP's masterfully orchestrated sounds, courtesy of Jim Guthrie. The character of the world and atmosphere is well-contained by the story's brevity, delivering a potent and memorable engagement.This game only asks players to be a little patient and take in subtle details when confronted with an obstacle. Exploration and experimentation is often rewarded, and an inquisitive attidude will help players through the story.			",199,66,2,18,17,4,21

												A slower-paced game from the normal RPG. This game has pretty pixel graphics, an amazing soundtrack, and a good puzzle system. While the combat isn't exciting or, well, anything much, it does add a bit of tension. The story is pretty narrative-based, so don't expect much dialogue. The music, being the thing that got me hooked, is amazing. Well-done with very solid tracks that I still eventually listen to, it is one thing that will get you gripped. The puzzles themselves are okay, but unless you go against what you're accustomed to in RPGs, you will find yourself looking for a guide. Overall?: 9/10. Well done artstyle mixed with a solid sense of wonder and passion in the dev's work, this game, and its free soundtrack included, will keep you hooked all the way through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I absolutely adore this game! The pixel art is gorgeous and the music is fantastic (I often listen to the soundtrack as background noise, Jim Guthrie did an amazing job), and at a play length of only a few hours the game is just long enough to leave the player satisfied without being bored by hours of no substantial content.The writing is really fun and has a great juxtaposition with the setting which I love. Even though the story is set in a fantasy land and you play as a Scythian warrior there's a really modern feel to the way things are written and characters interact. It's interesting having the main character (who, might I mention, is a woman! extra points!) using ""we"" instead of ""I""; for example, in the beginning there's a part where you can examine a girl sitting in a field, and the main character says, ""Far from the war-ravaged steppes of Scythia we met a dark-haired girl in a sunlit meadow."" It's a great way of really drawing the player into the game! Almost every line of dialogue also has an option for posting to your twitter, I never used it but if that's your sort of thing it seems like fun.The controls can be a little weird to get the hang of at first if you're like me and don't bother looking at instructions, especially playing on a PC since the game was originally made for a touch screen. Once you get the hang of them though they're super easy. I love that the combat system ups the difficulty not by introducing new things to the combat but by simply reducing your health bar as the main character gets more tired and worn down. It's a unique way of creating more urgency without simply making the bosses do more damage, and I think it's a great way to play into the story.If this game is your kind of thing, I'd definitely check it out!

I like story and environment but idea to cut it in pieces and have a ""host"" like in tv show before and after every episode breaking a mood for me, and also I don't like writing that much, not enough fantasy and  mystery and too much modern words and babbling.But in the end I will go with thumbs up, but I must warn you this is very unique experience and definitely not for everyone so chose wisely :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't know if ""played"" is the correct word, since this really didn't strike me as being a game, more like a boring commercial that I'm forced to sit through.  Before you think about purchasing this, just remember, you're on Steam for heaven's sake!  There are so many, many, many more interesting games for you to buy here for the same or less.  Even if you're into point & click adventure games, this game IMHO is at just about the bottom of the list.Now that I think about it, I guess it might be worth $0.50 for your phone, to keep your kids or niece busy while you do something else...

												This is more of an experience that an actual game. Even though there is some gameplay, like a couple of battles, and puzzles to solve, you'll also spend a lot of the time walking through the world and interacting with it, without doing much. It's still, in my opinion, a recommendable experience, as I found it slightly relaxing; the soundtrack is great, and the story, although there isn't much of it, is quite good.

												Definitely a shorter game, but that can be expected from a ported iPhone app. The game mechanics themselves don't do much for me, mainly because it was optimized for touch screens. The music and art style, however, are absolutely beautiful. Being that the art was the reason I bought the game, I was not disappointed. The music fits in amazingly and sometimes interactively with the current action of the game, and the game is as beautiful as the store page suggests. Also, the game is split up into episodes that provide great stopping points, so rather than doing my usual ""Power though the indie game to reach 100%"" race, I've been taking my time and enjoying it much more than I might have otherwise.

I like story and environment but idea to cut it in pieces and have a ""host"" like in tv show before and after every episode breaking a mood for me, and also I don't like writing that much, not enough fantasy and  mystery and too much modern words and babbling.But in the end I will go with thumbs up, but I must warn you this is very unique experience and definitely not for everyone so chose wisely :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A modern point-and-click adventure with fantastic pixel art and one of the most immersive soundtracks I have ever heard in a game.Puzzles make sense, exploration takes place in interesting settings, music and sounds are perfectly timed and appropriately themed, fighting is sparse but meaningful, the story is seen more than read, and the humor is witty and self aware. The game can be beaten in a few hours but there are achievements and secrets to find.One of my favorite games for its immersive atmosphere and music, which comes automatically with the game. Now we're cosmic friends forever, ok?			",217,43,1,6,12,1,21

												Smart and beautiful, this is another great indie game. Unique use of pixel art gives it a feel of its own.  The sound design and music is excellent, including a segment where you can play along.  There are some timed combat scenes, but this is primarily an adventure puzzle game.  Well worth the few hours it'll take to play through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very short game (i finished it with all the achievements in 4 hours, i am sure you can do it in less). Graphically pretty, the music is good for the game, it makes a lot of reference to other classic games but it's very original, the story is great and weird, good weird that is.I think the experience is better on the original platform (iPad) than on PC but overall it's a nice game and has some extras for steam. Buy if you want to try something different and kind of weird, plus its cheap.			",353,104,12,38,16,2,41

												I absolutely adore this game! The pixel art is gorgeous and the music is fantastic (I often listen to the soundtrack as background noise, Jim Guthrie did an amazing job), and at a play length of only a few hours the game is just long enough to leave the player satisfied without being bored by hours of no substantial content.The writing is really fun and has a great juxtaposition with the setting which I love. Even though the story is set in a fantasy land and you play as a Scythian warrior there's a really modern feel to the way things are written and characters interact. It's interesting having the main character (who, might I mention, is a woman! extra points!) using ""we"" instead of ""I""; for example, in the beginning there's a part where you can examine a girl sitting in a field, and the main character says, ""Far from the war-ravaged steppes of Scythia we met a dark-haired girl in a sunlit meadow."" It's a great way of really drawing the player into the game! Almost every line of dialogue also has an option for posting to your twitter, I never used it but if that's your sort of thing it seems like fun.The controls can be a little weird to get the hang of at first if you're like me and don't bother looking at instructions, especially playing on a PC since the game was originally made for a touch screen. Once you get the hang of them though they're super easy. I love that the combat system ups the difficulty not by introducing new things to the combat but by simply reducing your health bar as the main character gets more tired and worn down. It's a unique way of creating more urgency without simply making the bosses do more damage, and I think it's a great way to play into the story.If this game is your kind of thing, I'd definitely check it out!

												I would recommend this game as long as you temper your expectations accordingly because while it's somewhat enjoyable it isn't the deep meaningful tale that the professional reviewers at IGN and Gamespot say it is.  The amazing music and beautiful scenery make for a great experience but the actual puzzles and gameplay elements are lackluster, and the story is dressed up to be something meaningful but its ultimately underwhelming in its execution. This is more of an audio and visual experience than a game and as long as you understand that it's very enjoyable.			",224,67,2,24,7,0,24

												The music is great.Also this game has a strong force to draw me in its world compared with some so called 3a games which look real but fail to create a 'real' feeling.Still there is something i'm unhappy with:IM NOT A VIOLENT PSYCHOPATH.The  grizzled boor really freaks me out and i don't think there could be someone calm enough to leave his back to this horrible creature at that moment,so i killed it.Anyway,this game is denfinitely worth trying.ps:i've been enjoying the ost these days,it's also good as an independent music product.

												Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP is a good game with questionable implementation.The game is a point-and-click adventure game with a heavy emphasis on music and stylistic pixel art graphics. The story is told more via a narrator character and through reading the minds of NPCs as opposed to through other means in the game. For a point and click adventure it's rather engaging, but more from an exploration perspective than from a plot perspective. The puzzles, by and large, can be a little obtuse, and the combat is simple. Some of the puzzles in the game involve the moon's phase (although there's an in-game shortcut which allows you to bypass having to wait for two weeks).Basically, I enjoyed this game, but at times it seemed like that was in spite of the game, not because of it. The mechanics and playstyle are probably better suited to a tablet (which I believe this game was originally for), but if you enjoy adventure games, it's probably a good purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an absolutely lovely game. The art is beautiful, the music is great, and the writing is clever and silly in just the right ways. This does things narratively that few games pull off well.Because it was a tablet game, the control scheme is different from what you'd expect in a point-and-click adventure game, but it works rather well. The puzzles are about exploration and observation, rather than lock-and-key logic and inventory management, which felt smooth and refreshing.Overall, it's a very pleasant, zen experience.The only complaint I have about it is how it pushes the social media angle.

												Good game. Ran well on my computer. Graphics are very nice and interesting. The game is a little bit frustrating at some points, including clicking around randomly to find the light and waiting for about 30 seconds in the boss fights without any action. I enjoyed the adventure, but the game was a bit short. Getting the achievement for cheating is tricky after completing the game 100%. Try deleting your save file then exiting and reentering multiple times if you have trouble.9/10 game.			",169,40,1,10,17,2,16

												The very first thing the game asked me to do, before introducing any gameplay elements or instructions for controls or literally anything else, was tweet about the game.I had to leave the game running for 5 minutes to write a review.I don't know that I need anything else to justify uninstalling the game and giving it a thumbs down.

												Awesome!A bit frustrating at times, probably because it was designed for touch interfaces.If you get stuck check a guide quick, the game is great because everything feels unique and memorable, wandering around looking for whatever you need to do next kills the experience.

												Superborthers: Sword & Sworcery EP is exactly what it's shown to be in the title, an Extended Play. Let's give it a listen.Well, dude, before we listen we need to think about what we are listening to. Superbrothers from a story perspective, follows the riveting and sacrificial journey of a warrior woman who isn't from around Migmi Taw. She has to place together esoteric constructs in order to defeat a dark force. In short, it's a tragic hero's journey through and through, but with a twist. During loading screens and within certain objects the game's administrator breaks the forth wall reminding us that we are playing a thought experiment with a twitter overlay. Overall the plot of this game maybe isn't moving or entirely grounding in solid logic, but it is very relaxing. It's a story that you will find yourself slowly slipping into just enjoying, even if you don't quite understand it all. In short, Superbrothers is thought provoking, complex, but most importantly just casually enjoyable. Compounding on that relaxing story line is the game's stellar presentation. The creators went the route of a beautifully detailed pixel art style and holy crap does it impress. Environments are vibrant and varied, begging you to explore every single inch. You'll move from a concert to a forest to a massive monolith in mere moments. Not to mention the environments show you how to solve the puzzles given to your character, which means you never feel completely lost or stuck. From a battle design standpoint, these locals are made for exploration and variable atmosphere not combat. Still no location in the game traps you into combat without giving you a chance to ready yourself, meaning that you won't die and flip a table. The game play in Sword & Sworcery is really the only major weak point in the experience. Originally developed as an IOS application, the game's touch screen control system has been poorly appropriated to its PC counterpart. So many aspects of puzzle solving, combat, and movement can feel uncomfortable due to the constant feeling that you’re moving too slow or that your keyboard is uncomfortable. It greatly detracts from the experience on the whole and it's a complete shame, since it could have been fixed by simply allowing the player to move using WASD. Otherwise the puzzles are nicely integrated into the environments, the combat system is simple and rhythm based (which floats nicely with the sound design), and the twitter integration is completely optional allowing your experience to be as public or private as you want. So now to the most important part of the EP, the sound. Superbrothers is quite literally the best sound designed game I have ever played. The tracks are memorable because of both their intricacy and connection to various areas we spend extensive time exploring within the game. Combat tracks are adventure tracks are bass filled and mesh extremely well with the timing based combat system. More esoteric tracks fit beautifully with the cut scenes and trigon collection moments. The music alone is moving, thematic, and overall excellently composed. And it doesn't end there; the sound effects in the game are excellent. Pounding waterfalls, light footsteps, water splashing, or logs falling Sword & Sworcery will provide you an immersive sound experience. So then to summarizePros:- relaxing and thought provoking storyline- breaking of the 4th wall- extremely detailed pixel art- highly varied environments- Puzzles and environment mesh well- Excellent OST- Excellent Sound Design / SFX- Non-invasive social media experienceCons:- breaking of the 4th wall- Poorly appropriated controls hinder experience- Social media experience?Now for you completionists out there, I would not tell you not to give this one a go. Most of the achievements in the game can be collected by just playing the game, or doing 4th wall breaking things like setting forward your device clock. But there are a few more difficult ones. For instance you must use the megatome to kill 7 rabbits. This can be tricky due to the mechanic never being explained, but don't fret. You only have a few options at your disposal so it's not hard to figure out how to accomplish this. There is no completion bonus for this game, but it's also not that hard to complete so just sit back and enjoy it.  With all this in mind I guys this game a score of 8.3 out of 10 and a completionist rating of Finish it! ",69,7,0,4,3,0,8

												I just love the graphics of this game. I'm just a sucker for pixel-art, it's crazy. That, and the game is just great. It's some sort of point-and-click adventure mixed with a couple of battles. The music is also done in a cool way and fits the game perfectly. Man, the music during the battles... don't get me started; it's lovely !I hear you ask; 'doesn't this game have any flaws then ?' Unfortunately, it does. The narrative isn't handled all that well, the game is quite short, and there's a lot of backtracking involved. Now, none of that really bothered me, but I do wish there were more locations. And some of the puzzles require a bit of pixel hunting. It would've been nice if they were handled in a different way (either make it more obvious or change the puzzle(s) altogether).Still, a very pleasant (and cheap) surprise ![Rating: 89/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												This is the first time I write a review of a game, but I just had to. I paid 1.19 euro (which is an incredibely small sum) for it and finished it. You'd say this should have been a bargain, but I feel sour after playing it.Initially the story, the mood and the style in which it is written is really captivating. But regrettably everything becomes so VERY repetitive, dull and eventually irritating, the same can be said for the fantastic music.I'm one of the few PC owners nowadays who owns a dedicated audiocard (high-end one), I have 5 HI-FI speakers in surround and it sounds fantastic. It really does, but after the first 60min you play this game you have heard everything so many times. This coming from a guy who still sings the Civilization IV themesong out loud.Please play this to the end of act II, that is the best place to stop and leave with a smile.-The combat is very lackingSome puzzles make very little senseothers are blatantly obviousSome actions in the world do not make senseEverything stops after the first 30 min, there is nothing that keeps this mysterious world interesting.+An incredible first 30min of gametimeInteresting character build up			",40,12,0,8,6,0,19

												People say it’s easy, it is.People say it’s cryptic, it is. People say the art is beautiful, it is. People say the soundtrack is wonderful, it is. People say the characters are one dimensional. They are.People say the characters are deep. They are.People say it’s inspirational. It is.People say it’s dumb. It is.People say it’s intelligent. It is....Characters don’t have to be super detailed to serve their purpose or be fun. A game doesn't have to inspire everybody, we are inspired by the things we find inspiring and those are not the same for everyone. A game doesn't have to be super intelligent or dumb to be enjoyable by everyone. A game doesn't have to make sense to be fun. Everyone has an opinion. What’s yours? Will you be weighed down by preconceptions or misconceptions that you read about this game? Weighed down by hype or hate? Weighed down by what a game 'should' or 'should not' be? Should you nitpick the game away and strip it of its fun? Or does the act of nitpicking make it fun for you?Buy it and decide for yourself. How can you know if you'd enjoy this game without actually playing it? We have a refund system now.And more importantly, relax, your woeful errand is just beginning, but don't worry it will wait until your ready.			",99,63,0,42,18,1,20

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is a pretty cool experience. It's mainly a point-and-click, adventure game with a few mild puzzles and a smidgen of combat thrown in. It relies heavily on a strong narrative and kinda, sorta delivers. I had fun, I guess.Basically, Sword & Sworcery is a retro, sidescrolling version of Dear Esther, except it has combat and stuff. You're an adventurer set out on an adventure to carry out an adventure. You generally succeed. There's a bunch of peculiar characters you meet along the way.There's a few easter eggs and hidden locations in S&S if you're into that kind of thing. The music is pretty cool. The pixel art is also quite nice, the environments are fairly eccentric, mostly.Oh yeah, S&S also incorporates Twitter into the game experience for some reason, but it's not necessary to further your enjoyment. I have no idea why it's an option, all it does is let you tweet certain phrases.Whilst Sword & Sworcery is mainly text-based there are a few spoken lines for some reason. Kinda caught me off guard at first but it was interesting. Yeah. That's all I have to say about that.The general tone of the game is quite whimsical and sort of reads like this recommendation. It's slightly odd. Sort of a typical fantasy setting but with modern forms of speech, slang, ""cool, hipster"" vernacular, et cetera. It's like being told a story by a pretty chill, arty-farty, pretentious twenty-something year old who kinda mumbles a bit. I'm not sure if it adds or subtracts from the experience but it wasn't at all grating, it just sort of worked.			",827,302,26,81,66,10,105

												Ill judged humor and a useless Twitter function bars an otherwise loving and beautiful adventure game tribute to everything from Atari to C64 gaming, Zelda to Shadow of the Colossus and even Twin Peaks, from being the modern masterpiece that it ought to be. Features a somber soundtrack by Jim Guthrie that matches the dream like visual perfectly. Recommended, but you might want to get it for a tablet device, as it was originally developed with those in mind.			",452,185,10,54,37,3,54

												This game... it's awesome.I loved the art style, the plot, the characters, the ideas with puzzles, megatome etc.One thing which started annyoing me a little bit was too much walking (at the end of the game) - I mean the part with the lost trigons. Worst thing was like dying 3rd time in a battle with a trigon. :D But overall experience was beautiful, I highly recommend this game if you like games like Myst and also artistic ones: Ritual, Bernband.

												Okay, well, what to say?This game has faults, I'm sure all of which have been hit on by other reviews. There is a lot of backtracking, the point and click movement can be clumbsy at times, there's no character development and it's quite short.But you know what? It's fun, it's fun and it's quirky and although I steamed through it in an afternoon I recommend it if you want something relaxing to have a little break with. The scenery is nice, the music it good and the combat is actually resonably rewarding - even though it's just timing two buttons.I liked it and I was charmed, I doubt everyone will be but I guess you won't know until you try it.

												The first thing that I feel must be said about this game is that it's closer to a piece of installation art than a game. On paper it's a point-and-click adventure with some short rhythm-based combat sequences. In practice the puzzles require paying more attention to the music than to their logic, the storytelling is deliberately bizarre and less relevant than the overall feeling the graphics and music combined will give you. If you're looking for an actual game, with logic, content and progression then this game is not for you. If on the other you're looking for something you can enjoy over 3-4 nights, with the lights off and a good pair of headphones then it'll be a great experience. It's like walking through an exhibition, with great music setting the mood and slowly walking you through it.			",82,18,0,22,7,1,19

												Just finished this game and I loved it! I played through this on my iPad, but I have to say that the PC version is much more enjoyable to me so far. I think this is a game that is best enjoyed when you're not on-the-go, so that is why I prefer the PC version. Seeing it on a bigger screen and hearing it with better speakers makes it much more immersive. It has one of the most unique art styles I have ever seen. The music is fantastic and I have been listening to the soundtrack frequently outside of the game. The story is intriguing. In short, this is a masterpiece and well worth the 4-5 hour play-through if you can accept the strangeness and just try ""feel"" the game and the music. They put a lot of emotion into it. Oh, and use a nice pair of headphones if you have access to some.Pros:*Even though it's a point-and-click adventure game, you get a little sword fighting/blocking action which is great in my opinion.*Music! Awesome feel.*Art style is very unique and beautiful.Cons:*Not much replay value, but for a low price that's not much of an issue for some people.9/10			",555,131,13,75,45,7,55

												It has left me kinda disappointed. Art graphics and music are beatiful but the rest (story, gameplay, ...) doesn't come up to. It lacks of deep story, cold characters, dialogues without depth, repetitive situations, it doesn't require much effort to solve puzzles and some situations are very slow (and this may discourage).(Too much triangle, indie, twitter and modernillo stuff is kinda annoying too).Only if you are looking for inspirational pixel art images and and good atmosphere I recommend this game. Or maybe I could recommend this game for ""tablets"" (as a minigame) and not for computer.It could be a much better game (because it got it in some aspects) than what I have experienced.We hope to the next time to play a great pixel game in all aspects!

												Sword & Sworcery's atmosphere is heavily built on the use of sound and music. It uses it to create tension during combat as well as a sense of calm and mystery during the more exploratory parts of the game.The story is structured from short sentences describing your surroundings, the thoughts of various characters, and the presence of reoccuring characters. Most of the time it builds a light mythology for itself, though some of the phrasing used is designed to replicate a more modern speech pattern, a sort of meta-narrative.Difficulty is created by reducing the player's health as they progress, and while this may sound trivial, it is cleverly tied into the story and allows for simple combat that doesn't need to throw additional mechanics at the player.

												This game is a MASTER PIECE that IS NOT FOR EVERY PLAYER.This game is neither a point and click adventure nor a rogue-like nor RPG. It is most a GENRE BY ITSELF, a masterpiece as I have said. Graphics and music are georgous, but its own style goes from the menuscreen to the interface of the game, even to its internal logic, which is not designed to be fully understood. This is not a game for a harcore gameplay, you are supposed to guess what to do next by observing with your five senses inside the game, and out of the game too, because the time at you play it influences in the developing of the game. You are understanding the game, its logic and its own rythm as you play it, so judging it just at the begining is not to judge the game, but reject its potential.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

! 7/10The one problem with this game is its designed for tablet or touch surface in particular. This can lead to an epic battle digressing to a show down with your mouse and the two button battle mode instead of the in-game enemy.Outside of this issue the aesthetic balance between the game's graphics and sound is amazing. The sound pairs with the actions you preform in the game enviroment so readily that you experience a whole new dynamic to the gameplay rarely felt in games; where sound becomes as stirring an emotional influence as the visuals. Many of the scenes are so well crafted that the sound effects of enemies, or even your own actions, blend seamlessly into the music giving the impression of perfect symmetry between player and game as even your own decisions occur seemingly in perfectly harmony with the soundscape. It has been a long time since a game enviroment has engrossed me to the extent that video games did in my early childhood taking me on epic adventures and journeys. Play Sword and Sworcery for the good laughs from the offbeat humor and the musical crescendo of nostalgia that is its classic story line.			",62,12,0,5,2,0,4

												First time playing this game, don't know anything about it but had seen screenshots of it before and it looked wonderful. Open the game, nice title screen, nice art, the heck: how do I get out of this screen with some dude smoking? Oh you click on him like three times. HOW THE HECK WOULD I HAVE KNOWN! Okay move on, looks like I get to finally jump in to a level, err how do I move. Why does WASD move the screen and everything else do nothing? Why does left click make sounds... It all makes sense. I made a huge mistake. It's a music game. That's why the title care had a vinyl, that's why the dude was making music when I clicked him three times, that's why you just stand in one spot and click on enviroment to make music.

												Sword & Sworcery features a female warrior on a quest to reunite triangles lost in a mysterious fantasy realm located somewhere between dream and reality. The intriguing story is divided into three increasingly long sessions, each briefly presented by monologue from The Archetype, with a shorter final one acting as a sort of conclusion.Very appealing and well executed pixel art embodies artistic simplicity met with astounding precision and remarkable sensitivity. Simple but fluid animations infused into every corner of the world, along with subtle color shifts that gracefully enhance the liveliness of the scenes, create a mesmerizing environment unlike any other.A solid soundtrack suits the mood perfectly, composed mostly of rock-tinged retro ambient ballads, properly extravagant mood trips, doom and gloom, and a wealth of high quality atmospheric sounds.Dishearteningly and despite all the game does exceptionally well, there is too much to loathe about everything done wrong, or too peculiar to be enjoyable. Every time it surprised me with an awesome moment, of which there are a good few, it had to immediately remind me of its many glaringly frustrating elements.Sword & Sworcery's totally awkward controls, obviously initially created for touch devices, do not play well in a mouse configuration, despite efforts made to ease the transition. Almost every design decision taken by the developer seems counter intuitive or ergonomically inefficient. Thankfully simple hints pop up from time to time to explain the more cryptic expectations.Dreadful combat sequences require learning unavoidable patterns and hitting one of two buttons at the right moment, often with no clear consequence until repeated exposure. Later combat sequences can only be described as cheap rhythm games akin to playing ping pong. And waiting. Battles are exceptionally long for surprisingly so little action, as most of the time is spent waiting for a cue. Fights are so unequivocally counter-intuitive that an explanation comes after each failed attempt in the game's Megatome, a sort of encyclopedia chronicling important characters' personal thoughts.The same boring and uneventful fights keep re-happening fairly frequently, without actual rewards, presumably to artificially extend playing time.There are some funny and/or clever bits of dialogues and descriptions, though it eventually becomes banal to read blurbs drenched in juvenile hipster crass hidden among rare gems. Despite the intriguing setting and the very charming characters, the whole affair reads like an aspiring author's collection of best attempts at mystic alliterations and esoteric one-liners.Most Sworcery puzzles mainly consist in (optionally) ingesting magic mushrooms to see specific parts of the environment lit up, then figuring out in which pre-determined order the game expects you to click to release sylvan sprites. I found no logic to these segments most of the time, so it turned out to be tedious guesswork for the more obtuse ones and deceivingly simple otherwise.Parts of the game accurately synchronize with the actual moon's phases, marking one of the game's most unique and truly original ideas. Fortunately, the developers realized that being able to play entire sections of their game only once a month at full and new moons was a spectacularly bad proposition, and they built a way to temporarily alter the phases of the moon directly in the game, essentially circumventing the entire feature's purpose and value.A few other minor flaws and annoyances include the main character constantly referring to herself in the second person, completely useless Twitter integration on every single line, slow character movement, and too often self-referential for its own benefit.This game offers a beautiful world in which I would love to get lost for hours, if only it offered anything worthwhile to do.

 Complete Rating: 2/10 Visuals: 1/10Audio: 2/10Story: -/10Gameplay: 2/10Another one of those bad-graphics, bad-sound, ""lets focus on story"" games. I do not like that i cannot make out half of which is displayed on th screen and i do not like bad controls. If i play something and i do not like how it looks and there is no action at all the first 5 minutes, im gone. If i want a story with no graphics, i read a book ",164,40,10,21,32,4,63

												Wait, let me explain.SB:S&S EP should not be considered a video game in the traditional sense.  It is an interactive multimedia art experience.  Coming into it with that attitude will provide the right frame of mind to potentially enjoy it.  All art is subjective.As a game it isn't very interesting.  The world to be explored is composed of a handful of set scenes.  Combat is both simple and repetitive.  Most of the puzzles are simple if you are keeping up with the dialog.  You will not be challenged here.  There is a very strong 'hipster' vibe throughout.  If that's what you are into, huzzah, but for me it was grating.			",120,26,2,11,4,0,22

												A point and click game designed for iphone users with plenty of social media intergration, chatspeak ingame dialog, and confusing puzzles which they intended for the user to repeatedly come back to at different times to see if the solution presents itself. As a PC user, this is less than thrilling or entertaining. Sure it's got good music and they definitely have an interesting art style (which I don't like but I'll give credit for the attempt) but there's little else going for it. The story unfolds slowly, and it wasn't enough to keep me paying attention. Dialog and descriptions are always either really weird and nonsensical or written as if you got a text message from someone else on an iphone, which strikes me as really lame. As you scroll sideways occasionally you'll get in a fight or a puzzle. Fights are a mess which probably didn't need to even be in this puzzle game, but whatever. Puzzles sometimes require different touches or gestures which would seem natural to an iphone gamer, but not to a PC user. In addition the puzzles often give no clues or really vague clues as to their solution. Puzzles are really obtuse. In fact, as I hinted earlier, the game is connected with your clock and calendar, and certain puzzles can more or less easily-or sometimes not at all- be solved at specific times of day or phases of the moon. Again, this would be more interesting if I was on a phone playing 15 minutes at a time, a couple times a day.I dunno, some reviewers say it's a masterpiece, but the only masterful part about it is the music. Maybe I'm wrong, but even if a game is boring or frustrating, isn't the dialog and story supposed to keep me interested to push through? Well, didn't happen here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wanted so bad to love this game. I really loved the music and art style, but both times I tried to play it I was turned off by the writing. I know the creators were trying to be humorous, but it just came off as trying-to-hard pathetic and broke immersion. I'll probably just stick to the soundtrack and skip the game - it's way too irritating to play.			",91,12,0,24,19,0,27

												5/10 - One word: Confusion.  The atmosphere and music of the game is nice and relaxing, but the clues (or lack thereof) it gives you leaves you frequently stuck and frustrated.  It IS possible to get through the game without a guide (I did it in under 5 hours), but it takes patience and a bit of tenacity.I was on the fence whether to recommend this game or not, because despite what I said above, I still enjoyed the game.  However, I don't think that I would put my reputation behind it.			",69,14,0,5,1,0,0

												A game can be about anything, but this game was about nothing. The characters are flat and everything they say is forgettable, as with the story.  This game features twitter integration, which is useless. it allows you to tweet the lines of dialog from the game. But, why would you want to do that. There was a terrible mechanic in game to stall for time, dragging out the torture of a game that could be defeated in just a few hours. All combat is incredibly trivial. The main character was arbitrarily female, it beared no relevance to the story nor impacted any of her silent decisions. I don't think the puzzles were very interesting. Some praise the music, I didn't fall in love with it. Skip this one, or be prepared to remember the disappointment.			",149,22,4,19,8,0,7

												S:S&S is a game that tries too hard.Its visual and audio style are both incredible, and the game is a joy to experience, but it quickly goes downhill once you start trying to actually do something.The controls are the first thing that hits you. It becomes immediately apparent that this is an iPad game. 'Replacing touch with a mouse is clumy, but I can deal with that,' you say. And so you deal with it. The controls don't seem to get more intuitive, but at least they're workable.Then you get to a girl named Girl, and that seems quirky. And this quirkiness stays pretty consistent, which means it gets a little annoying. There's a g-man that says a bunch of big words that essentially mean nothing, a woodman that states the obvious, and a dog that barks. Whatever, you've seen iffy writing before, and you continue.But then you realize that you're incredibly slow. Annoyingly so. Most of the game is spent waiting for your character to slowly meander across the beautiful pixel landscape. You can only explore an area the first time through, but this game will keep sending you back and forth through it. So you deal with it.This slowness carries through to your interactions with things. Everything needs to be clicked and held, or maybe rubbed for a while. Or strummed or touched just right, or poked a few times.Which brings us to the puzzles. If you can call them that. You click and hold on a thing (for a while,) then you have to interact with... something. Sometimes that something glows, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you need to slowly walk over to a mushroom and eat that first before you can see the thing you have to do something to. And once you figure out what you're interacting with, and how to interact with it, you have to divine what ORDER to interact with those things. I could find no rhyme, reason, or explanation to how this worked. It was pretty much just random clicking that eventually got me through.'But this game is rated Mostly Positive in user reviews!' you say. And yes, it is, so you keep going, thinking that there's gotta be something incredibly redeeming about this game.Perhaps this is so highly rated because it wallows in how artsy it is. Everything about this game is artsy. Yes, it's pretty. Yes, it sounds good. Yes, it's pretentious. But that doesn't make it good. Anyway, you think this, and continue on to...The first boss. Now, combat up to this point has been pretty simple. There's been a wolf that you block attacks from, and it seems like you can't hit it, though it's never explained why not; and there was a statue or something that you blocked and then hit while it was stunned. That was actually pretty okay. But the boss? Oh no, it doesn't follow the few combat rules laid out up to this point.So far, the player has been shown that you are capable of blocking god damn anything with your shield. So the boss betrays your trust with an unblockable attack. You fumble your way to finding the solution to this little problem and make it to the next step. Now the boss triggers an audio cue, at which point you tap the block button and dodge to the side. THIS IS NOT INDICATED OR USED UP TO THIS POINT. Until you dodge, you don't even know that dodging is a mechanic. This is terrible design.Zelda gets blasted for overusing the new toy and throwing it away at the end of a dungeon. But do you know why they do that? The entire dungeon is spent training the player how to use said toy before offering a final test of the player's skill in the form of the boss fight. S:S&S throws this entire concept to the wind and throws random crap at you and laughs when you don't pick it up immediately.I think the boss is supposed to be beaten through trial and error, but 'trial and error' and 'figue out the new mechanic on the spot' are not the same thing. And since everything takes so damn long (the boss's first attack is over a minute after you triger it, every time,) it's really hard to keep pushing yourself through this encounter.I certainly didn't.And that is why I do not recommend this game. Maybe get the soundtrack and poke a Let's Play or something, because it's really pretty and sounds great.			",211,53,13,24,50,2,16

												Do not buy this game. The gameplay is extremely limited - click to move; click to interact with object; click to send a tweet about object.The environment is bland and uninteresting; with the artstyle looking vague and on the wrong side of ""indie"" (read: disgusting).The main selling point of this game seems to be the OST, given the name of this game (Sword and Sworcery EP), but the soundtrack is just as uninspired as the rest of the game; it's generic and not at all memorable. Even the movement controls in this game are terrible. Want to move to an object? Double click on it. OOPS! Looks like nyour reading a description of the object isntead of going over to it. And why are you giving me the option to send a tweet about literally every single interaction I am having in this game? People arent going to care! In-fact, it'll probably annoy them.The characters as just as shallow as this game is ugly. I had no idea that the player character is supposed to be a woman. Yep. That scrambled, elongated mess of pixels is supposed to be a woman.The writing trys to be funny and meta, but comes across as. again, uninspired and snarky. There seems to be no effort to try to make the player feel as if they are imersed within this fantastical world. Instead, it feels like a powerpoint presentation of screens that the character shambles through for no reason whatsoever. There is no goal presented to you at the start of the game, and no real stakes whatsoever.The ""combat"" is nothing more than a quicktime event, and when being ""chased"" by a baddy, all you need to do to outrun them is click on the exit.Simply put, this game is a bland, boring, stakless ""adventure"" with no real purpose. Alomst every single element in this game is underwhelming to say the least.Please do not purchase this game. ",87,24,0,19,20,4,24

												Sword & Sworcery is a short adventure game. It introduces a minimalistic and novel way to bring adventure games to touchscreen devices, but left me with the feeling that a pc game can be so much more. In adventures I live for atmosphere. While Sword & Sworcery's art and music do that perfectly (I really recommend the soundtrack), the narrative harshly drops the built up immersion in favor of ironically juxtaposing prose with blasé pop chatter. After finishing the game, I still don't have an understanding of my character's motives beyond that of any Mario game, and found no memorable companions along the way.			",98,43,3,11,10,0,5

												Perhaps I'm not the best to judge this game considering I have 2 hours logged in it. But that's the thing; In the two hours I've been playing the game, nothing has happened! I'll concede that the art is good, and the music is fantastic, but if I wanted to sit there and listen to music, I'd be doing that instead of trying to play a game.The game tries to be atmospheric, but all this does is set a pace that's way too slow. After a while, I hadn't really DONE anything. I had gone where the little arrows told me to go, and done what the little text boxes told me to do, but that's about it. I want to like this game, and I want to see the poetry in it, but no poem I've ever read requires me to sit through two hours of holding down a mouse and watching a pixellated character walk across a screen just to get to the good bit, wherever it may be.If you're into atmosphere, or you want to stare at pretty pixels while relaxing background music plays, buy this game. If you want to play a videogame, don't.			",136,17,2,21,11,1,17

												I really wanted to like this game. I love the rest of capy's games, but this one I couldn't get into. The art style and music is great. It is in the gameplay where this game falls short. Very easy and uninspired gameplay. It feels like a stripped down version of rpg combat. The game has you progress by walking SLOWLY between areas solving the same tedious puzzles over and over again, just to obtain these 3 triangles called trigon pieces. The overall game was not very fun, from slow walk speed, to tedious puzzles, a predictable story, to banal combat. The moment when I stopped was after obtaining the 2nd trigon piece and having the game say that in order to obtain the last piece I had to wait real world days for the next full moon. You could always change your clock but that would prevent you from getting 100%. Overall a beautiful looking yet disappointing game that is more fun to look at than to play.			",77,10,0,5,2,1,3

												A very mixed bag. Nice music, very nice sounds, I personally like the pixel asthetic, and in essence the game is an adequate but simple puzzle/adventure with a smidgen of quicktime-like action sequence. However, the writing is completely off in tone--super casual, very modern, laden with adolescent slang, and what little voice acting there is has the same issue. It might be going for a Katamari Damacy feel, but it comes across as disrespectful toward the material, and toward the player. Overall, cutesy. Cool if you're into that. Worth a couple of bucks.Then there's the marketing and hype. It's an obvious indie-scene darling, thanking Brandon Boyer, former Chairman of the IGF. But then it also has an award from the IGF and the GDC? Wins or is nominated Best Game by almost 2 dozen gaming publications, including IGN, Kotaku, Gamasutra, 1up, Gamesradar, PCMag, Venturebeat, Wired, Destructoid, on and on? One of Time Magazine's Video Games of the Year sitting beside Portal 2, Skyrim, Minecraft, and Dark Souls? I don't know who is in Capybara Games, but the wiki says it's a collection of IGDA members. So the same people making the games are the ones giving it awards. Am I supposed to believe it's being done on merit?This strains credulity well beyond reason. Keep in mind this is one indie game released the same year as Bastion, Terraria, and Binding of Isaac.  This reeks of having schmoozed its way to the top. In a fair world, I'd recommend this game and suggest buying it for $5 or less. But in the face of such ridiculous, hyperbolic, and inescapable praise, no. I cannot add a recommendation to such a sea of duplicity.			",207,139,1,24,27,0,29

												Sometimes it pays to be pretty. Especially if your personality is akin to that of a differently-abled llama.The pixel art is great, no doubt. However the scenery soon becomes repetitive and the initial charm of the landscapes diminishes. The clunky, unintuitive contols frustrate often. In particular, a chase scene quickly goes from tense and urgent to mouse-throwingly-irritating. As you try to escape, your mouse clicks ""grab"" the screen, dragging the scene in the opposite direction of the one in which you were attempting to move. Throw in the painfully glacial pace of your protagonist and navigating this lovely low-res world becomes a chore. Essentially the gameplay itself is pinned upon almost a singular mechanic, initiating ""scorcery mode"" and activating the environmental surroundings through mouse clicks in a specific order to release Forest Sprites. It's simplistic at its core, but often obtuse. You may however consume mushrooms to highlight these specific points of interaction, but maybe 'shrooms is how we've ended up here in the first place.  For all the emphasis on the soundtrack or the ""EP"", the tunes here are generally uninspiring, background ambience. A grating bell-dong accompanies every scroll of on-screen text that feels quite unnecessary. Although, the grunts and cries of your protaganist during battle sound fierce and have a Link-like charm. There's also a rambling, awkward monologue from a character that was somewhat amusing.The attempted casual, modern style of the text is an innovative idea, but feels forced. The word ""super"" is repeatedly thrown in front of adjectives, endevouring to be current.In spite of all this, I found the choice of a female lead character to be a commendable one. It's just a shame she doesn't have more to do.The parting announcement S:SS leaves you with- ""Your woeful errand is at an end."" Indeed... Indeed it is.Super disappointing.			",68,74,0,11,3,0,1

												When I first played the game, I thought the atmosphere and the art style was great. Although that was the only thing that this game really had to offer. In terms of gameplay, Sword & Sworcery had awkward point-and-click mechanics that would make walking from one side to another a chore especially since you have to walk through the same pathways over and over. The puzzles were too easy and combat was lackluster and unchallenging, making it annoying and pointless to fight that shadow guy everytime you have to walk through the same pathway a millionth time. The writing was also irritating as it tends to make unnecessary self-commentary everytime something happens that takes away any meaning to the story in a shallow attempt to be funny. And let's not forget that annoying voice acting of Logfella when he tries to make awkward conversations with you; it's unfunny and out of character (no attempt to sound like an old woodsman and instead sounds like an awkward teenager) which loses any immersion to the game. Overall I liked the style of the game but gameplay mechanics and story were not good. Not worth the 2 dollars I spent on this game.			",70,11,1,7,4,1,0

No real story, no real gameplay.It was designed to play on a tablet and I'm sure it was great at ""running on a tablet"" because other than tapping the screen, there's isn't anything else to do or experience.Oh, I forgot to mention. This game has a 2nd feature, aside from tapping the screen. You can retweet the occasional sentence that appears on screen. Yes, they integrated ""public self-shaming"" as a full-fledged feature.So many choices... should you tap the screen to progress or tweet that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sentence?			",117,28,1,31,4,0,18

												I have to say, I do like to play the 'experimental' games as they are usually interesting concepts and make a change from the usual run of the mill FPS I usualy play. Having said that, I didn't especially enjoy this. It's decent enough, and certainly intriguing. I personally just found the control system somewhat cumbersome, and had a really hard time figuring ut what the heck i was meant to be doing most of the time. I don't mind games that leave you to figure stuff out on your own, but most of the time, I just ended up wandering about doing random things until something happened to progress, more by good luck than logically figured out.  Having said that, the good soundtrack and retro style graphics did apeal and kind of added to the otherworldly-ness (not sure if that's a word!) of the atmosphere. There wasn't anything particularly terrible about this game, but nothing particularly stood out about this, aside from the soundtrack. And, I confess, the link into the social media kind of felt more gimmicky than innovative.  would I recommend it? In all honesty, probably not. There are plenty of 'experimental' games out there which feel much more accessible than this, and manage to combine innnovative ideas and gameplay (Dear Esther, for example, or Shelter even are two that spring to mind). Full marks for effort, but a bit too inaccessible for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really found they painfully obvious, talking about the moon phase and whatever it was to do next. it was really obvious to me that I had to wait for the moon phases and that if I didnt want to wait for it, I had to go to the dream world and search for something there. really, just read the conversations on that book. its written right there. even the game warns so.on the con side, the ""fights"" were really lame and did not add anything to the game. the trigon fights that were supposed to be ""boss"" fights were just as lame and repetitive. something that the dev really have to improve.anyway, I think its worth the full price.

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP was an interesting game. ...But not interesting enough.And what I mean by that is through my complete playthrough of the game, the game felt like it was trying to convey a bigger thought. A bigger picture and a larger frame of imagination.What bothers me is the game conveys these thoughts but then suddenly ends when it felt like it needed to start show casing it's cloud of information and thoughts of enlightenment.It was a pretty impressionable lacking feeling.The world SB:S&S takes place in was one that felt like it had a substantial amount of lore and background, but you were just a watcher who commands a Scythian to complete a quest they called ""A Woeful Errand"" It felt like that besides the errand, the world it takes place in isn't extremely meaningful to you as you're there to guide the Scythian to complete her mission. So most lore can easily be ignored or you can make the Scythian get a little bit of background information from reading her thoughts on the world around her and talking to other people. I appreciate that is was natural and people weren't just flushing the worlds background out of them into you.The game has an interesting way of connecting you to the characters involved in the game. Your character shortly after starting her errand aquires a book dubbed ""The Megatome""The Megatome allows you to see how many days until the next real life black moon or full moon. It also allows you to read the minds of others and establishes an interesting connection to people around you. Mind you, this function isn't gimmicky and isn't overdone. It's pretty simple but interesting.This game is a point and click adventure without a doubt. It was released first on the IOS and then for PC. During my playthrough, i'd say it's a little better suited for the IOS. But it works pretty darn well on the PC too, so it is a pretty good port nonetheless.The playing world is pretty narrow in-movement, but as far as what you need to do and exploring goes. The game respects your thoughts on where to go and what you should do. There is times where I got lost or tried to solve a puzzle in a area where there was no puzzle to be solved (by using the song of sworcery). But ultimately after maybe ten minutes at worst, i'd figure out where I needed to be and then they game kept moving.I appreciate that and the time loss isn't that bad, the only thing that will probably bother you about that is when you gotta hike all the way to where you need to be. The Scythians pacing can be a bit tiresome and annoying sometimes.The art style of the game is pretty great. Sometimes I feel like it wasn't tied too strongly to the story, so sometimes the art styles impact fell kind of short when the story was uprising towards it approach to its climax.Though at-times the art and the colors and sounds mixed-in with what was happening helped achieve a state of artistic enlightenment and a different kind of view on things. ...Also getting high on the occassional in-game mushroom helped that out a bit sometimes.Unfortunately, the same can be equally be said about the music. The music was perfect in areas and it carried emotions out of me. Feelings of intensity, feelings of whimsical peaceful happiness and others.But unfortunately as I said, there was times where the music felt really out-of-place or it was hard to understand what the music meant in-conjunction to the story or what was going on.Though that aside, the connections I grew with side characters and main characters was very nice. My personal favorite being the Grizzled Boor. I like how in the game the story isn't painfully linear. You actually may never even see the grizzled boor until the ending or there's other parts in the progression of the story where you may think that was just the story running its course. But not so, this helps build a level of replayability in the game. Though i'd say probably one or two playthroughs after the first, and you'll never play this game again most likely.The combat system is pretty basic and unimportant, which is good since it's not really a meaningful compenent of the game in the first place. Though there was a time where a battle felt really tense unexpected and there was a time where I had to fight someone and I didn't want to hurt them in the first place.Combat is pretty sparse, and usually pops-up in places when you've gotten kind of sick of the scythians mundane pacing through the world.That all aside, the game is a experience and a expression. They said it themselves that this game is an experiment (a social one (it encourages you to tweet things about the game)). I wouldn't really agree that it was a successful one or that they could get much data from their experiment, but it was still an okay test in my opinion. Though they needed to provoke more thought and stimulation of emotions in the game.Also they not only called it a social experiment, but also a sound experiment. Shamefully that lacked at a good amount of points too (as explained earlier) and after the 3rd chapter, you'd consider the sound experiment something of a joke. It had its time when it was woven very eloquently, but it wasn't consistently often and done very well.Perhaps the most touching parts of the sound experiment was when I was awakening Sylvian Sprites and when I sent them to the heavens above you would hear a happy child giggling and the sky would lighten for a second. I honestly cherished those moments when I was awakening the spirits and the peaceful tranquil sounds they made as you tapped them touched my soul a little bit.So ultimately, we arrive at the point. ""Should you get this game?"", and I say maybe.Through the games pieces of lacking material and parts of confusion and changing wavelengthts of script quality.There's parts and pieces of this game that are actually good, are things that need to be presented to the player.You won't get much out of it if you don't think a little bit about some of the things in this game for a short bit after or even during the game.I'd recommend getting it on a picecut like I did though.

												Superbrothers is to gaming what Adventure Time is to TV: something I just don’t get. Or maybe something you can only ""get"" if you're high.Controls are bad, graphics are junk, music is forgettable, story is…well, I’m not sure there is a story aside from references to other games like Zelda. I thought this would be an amusing diversion for an evening but instead it put me to sleep. Literally. I struggled to finish the first part because I kept dozing off. Shocked at how many people are praising the visuals. It’s nothing but blocky pixels everywhere, allegedly arranged in “poetic” fashion. Whatever.Superbrothers is sort of like Another World: there are action-type areas with puzzles mixed in. Except Another World is much better in every way, even the graphics, so you might as well play that instead. In fact, do anything else instead. If you have no other video game to play, read a book, surf the internet, eat a sandwich, exercise, anything. Your time will be better spent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Saw a review on this once that called it hipster garbage. Actually pretty accurate. Even as a person who generally enjoys good indies and isn't only attached to AAA's, I have to admit that the game has an indie-hipster feel that's a little too overpowering, and gameplay is meh. It's very clearly intended for touchscreen, which is annoying, the puzzles aren't clever buy simply obtuse, and the game beckons at every corner for you to tweet about its nonsense like ""Trigonal Trifectas"", which is clearly simply a clever homage to Zelda and definitely not a ripoff.This isn't to say that the game is worthless at all. A couple of things redeem it somewhat- 1, the nice visuals, which put the low bit count style to great use with nice lighting and colors, and 2, the music, which is equally atmospheric and inviting. I certainly wouldn't recommend paying full price for it, but if you pick it up from a bundle or for a dollar or two you might as well try it out, even if it's not that great it's still certainly no disaster.

												What's the only thing more horrible than a game having obnoxious QTEs slowing you down?I'll tell you: It's having a d0uchebag-level pretentious game completely halting your progress because of your computer's ACTUAL TIME AND DATE settings.I swear on my Gaben altar, I am not making this up:Lo and behold, this game demands you play it according to the £uckin' REAL WORLD MOON CYCLES to progress. Unless you got some key, which is only available if it is not a full or dark moon in REAL LIFE, which it of course wasn't the day I played it. Hence locking you out of getting the key and being able to alter the games moon phases with the cave that this key grants access to.I was ready to recommend this because of decent pixel artwork, nice music and all-around greatness, but when the games' messing with real world MOON CYCLES stops you from playing, well, that's just a boatload of steaming hipster sh|te that no one in their right mind would succumb themselves to.Into the garbage bin you go, you annoying filth of bits and bytes.

												After enjoying this game for a while, I decided to tuck it away unfinished. I was very excited to return to it several months later on the occaision of a rainy day. Unfortunately I have found the game to be completely unplayable since I returned to it. I cannot get the program to launch at all.If you are interested in a beautiful and soulful adventure told in a unique style, I recommend you find another method of playing the game. I greatly enjoyed the portion I played of Sword&Sworcery EP, but the technical nightmare of jumping through all the hoops to get the game running has come to a dead end. Don't buy it on Steam.

												Remember the times when you had to explore the land, uncovering secrets?  How you had to block enemy projectiles and avoid sword swings?  Timing your counterattacks?  Well, let's just♥♥♥♥♥♥all over this concept, and casualize it for the dumbed down audience of Tumblr and company (you can even link it to your Twitter, to annoy your audience with quotes of the game).The game is unbearably slow, and there's only but straight paths, making navigation a huge chore, only gets even worse when the creepto dude shows his face all the damn time.  It holds you by your hand, with instructions telling you what to do, and the combat is so simple it only requires an ounce of common sense.  The puzzles are nonsensical, like having to hold onto various objects, such as sheeps, in some order I can't grasp at all, wasting my time further, and rubbing the rainbows as the game tells you to, what?  There's also that thing about having to wait for two moon cycles in real life to get Trifor- I mean Trigon pieces; that's the stuff for side missions, not for progression.  There is the Moon Cave, but the game solely advertise waiting a month for the moon to fully shine, which is dumb.  (But... but it's art!!!)  Yeah, your usual artsy trash that us ""plebians"" can't comprehend.There are times that the game even tricks me into wasting my time; I had to first set the full moon from the Moon Cave, deep in the freaking long forest, go back to the Logfella's cabin to go to the Dream, to do all my errands with the ghost kids.  Afterwards, I had to find the ""miracle"", but the dog hurried me to go back to the cabin, so I did, but then the Logfella woke me up, and the moon is now at a crescent, meaning I had to do the WHOLE TRIP again!  That's not fun, it's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.Why are you even doing all this, what such inspired tale has you travel these lands?  Well it's really just jack all, you simply go collect the 3 legendary triangles to defeat the evil, all while speaking to characters that have as much depth as the underside of my fingernail.  It's the same kind of story that video games have been built upon for years, that whiny critics complain about constantly, and yet this is just riveting of creativity because it has some bullcrap, ambiguous elements that the developpers just didn't bother elaborating on, and uses some coquettish way of speaking that may make you feel bad if you try to play the game.Oh yeah, and make it obvious I could've not killed the bear thing or whatever, which I did thought of, but now it just calls me some sociopath because its mechanics were too trash, failing to point out I could've pulled away the sword, I couldn't even walk away!  Heck, when I slained it after a minute of trying to get out, wasn't it also me just putting it out of its misery, of its slit throat?  If you're going to shove me that kind of morality crap, make it work right for crying out loud.Graphics-wise, well, it's at least better than Greenlit games, but really, no matter how good it may be, it will not save anything, it'd be like putting the artists of the Fantasy Zone series behind the next Barbie movie, it'd be such a waste.  And even then, this game has no depth in its design, I think the pixel art is just a lazy way to not bother giving it a proper art style like many other 8-or-so-bit-like indie games, and the environments aren't so full of details and imagination that you'd try to imagine what might be going on in the distance, and aren't just fun to look at.  This game has no character, there's no magic, it's only pretending to have a soul by its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t storytelling that doesn't always make reasonable sense.Why am I so offended by it anyway?  Not only because it has no worth, but people want to shove this crappy concept of storytelling down our throats, much like Thirty Flights of Loving, they say that the Scythian is one of the best woman in gaming despite having no faults, no motives for her actions, just an hollow shell, and when it tries to be artsy or showing morals like the aforementionned bear, it fails miserably.  Plus, apparently having no gameplay whatsoever is excusable due to its presentation, no matter how crap the story and art style are.Our game design principles, that we have been refining for 30+ years, have stepped to such low levels ever since we thought that making you solely feel emotions is a much more fulfilling experience than the sense of accomplishment of defeating the final boss after a 20+ hour long endeavor.  Not to say we always need a happy ending, nor does it have to be platformers or shoot 'em ups, but there has to be something we must get out of the experience, and games should have a perfect balance of gameplay and presentation that make each of them stand out.  This game here hasn't delivered anything, yet it's one of the best game of all time, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.I utterly hate these games that focus more on story and ""art"", as the developpers have no idea on having any redeeming gameplay, and goes totally against my principles of game design.You want a game?  Play some Zelda, which is actually what this game was ""inspired"" by.  Even if I'm not a big fan of that series, it's miles better than this piece of dung, as it requires some actual skills, you could find neat secrets, and more importantly, has gameplay.  And since we talked about art, how about Donkey Kong Country 2?  That game is still gorgeous even to this day, having a sweet, emotional atmosphere, all while having excellent gameplay still unparalleled, and remains one of my favorite games, heck Diddy's character development in the manual has much more wits than the Scythian's lame attempt at it.  I also thought that Athena on NES just didn't worked on every fronts, but I've actually started seeing it in a more positive light, realizing that it at least didn't pretented to be something else, which I think would be the most toxic way of thinking.Sword & Sworcery, on the other hand, is absolute trash, just a dumb, glorified book.  It is, without a doubt, the worst game I've ever played.			",176,21,2,14,9,3,11

If, however, you're the kind of person who can relax and look around and find the journey from A to B as important as getting to B, this game might be right up your alley.

												Eight bucks for a CD's worth of prog rock in MP3, and an odd little adventure game that uses it for a soundtrack. Hard to go wrong there (unless you hate prog and love King's Quest). As a game, it's more a 'wanderer' or 'explorer' than 'adventure' title: the puzzles are simple, and relatively few, and the fight scenes aren't too difficult once you've got the enemy's rather obvious tells down.

												This game is everything within your mind that you feel is intangible. Those thoughts that touch the lobes furthest from your memory glands are personified by the visuals and audio this game seamlessly provides; it becomes a ride for the spirit, the soul, the heart. You become one within the 8-bit masterpiece that has been assembled. The soundtrack is best listened to when alone, staring into the abyss, hoping-- nay, daring it stare back at you.

												When people, one hundred years from now, finally decide to accept games as an art form, this will be considered one of the greats. The soundtrack is gorgeous, blending organic wind instruments with chirping synths and booming drums. The art is fantastic, using the pixelart form to present an incredible amount of detail. The gameplay is simple, but fun, and it helps move the narrative forwards. This is certainly one of the best experiences I've had playing a game.			",271,47,5,37,25,2,59

												Simply synethesia. Jimmie did a really good job on the score, and the Superbrothers create one of the best atmospheres. One SINGLE problem, though, and it's a doosie. YOU HAVE TO DUCKING WAIT IN REAL LIFE TO PROGRESS. I'm sort of a progress oriented person, and I don't like games where you have to wait for an event, such as Animal Crossing (It's a good game, but it's  not for me. No offence, AC fans :c). I suppose that's why I don't like real life, as well. I know you can set the clock forwards, but 1) I'm a lazy duck, and 2) I feel that the game wants me to continue au naturale to get a good experience. Also, don't think of this as a ""game"", think of it as an ""experience"". Get in a mindset that games like The Stanley Parable, any Telltale games, Heavy Rain, ETC. want you to be in, not the mindset you approach Mario or otherwise.			",125,13,3,4,19,1,10

												First thing's first. See that title? Sword & Sworcery is an EP, not a game proper. It is music foremost and a storytelling experience second.Despite what you may think and hear, this game is far from pretentious, and one of few examples where people will point to when they say that games can be art. Here is one so accutely self-aware that it nearly transcends it.At its base, Sword & Sworcery is a wacky adventure tied onto a pretty nifty soundtrack. It is an experiment in modern storytelling and game design. A fruitful experiment, infusing music with puzzles and battles and decidedly not vice versa. The visuals, as you can already tell, are beyond stunning.S&S is a game that tells its story almost in a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek manner. At risk small of ruining the surprise, I will say this: it is exactly this silliness that both allows you to come even close to taking it seriously, and the cleverness that makes you appreciate it all the more.If the plot were presented in a serious manner, few would take it seriously and it would just seem as pretentious and obfuscated as Braid. It is the humour and quirkiness of the title that makes the story penetrable at all. Despite the jests, the story is even more compelling if you take it as being honest.Now here's the sad bits: this is not meant for the PC at all. Find yourself a touch screen copy of this game. It is not meant to be completed in one or two sittings. You are meant to pace yourself and take it in chunks, and you'll be more likely to finish the game that way.Missing the ending is something you do not want to do. That is when everything sinks in.

												I got really attracted to this game at first because of its art. Now it completely took me over with its original music and sounds -- not to mention its quirky style when it comes to text and words in the game. This is not a fast-paced game - but it leaves an impression deep enough to remember. All the while, I can only use one word to describe this game - eccentric. And I am not even sure if this should be called ""a game"". Hehe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is realy funky.  I mean, on a completely superfluous level, it's gorgeous.  The sprite art and scenery is so simple but so decorative and detailed.  It's an amazing look.  And Jim Guthrie's music is just the best part about the whole game.  I've never fallen in love with a game's music faster than I have with Superbrothers.The gameplay is hit and miss for me.  I liked the exploration aspect, but the puzzles are usually far from tricky and the combat is clearly made for touch-screen devices like Android of iOS.  The three Trigon ""boss fights"" are also all basically the same, and considering those are some of the only enemies you encounter in the game, it would have been nice to see some creativity.  That being said, I would imagine they wanted as little combat as possible, so maybe that's why?  I dunno.As I mentioned, the exploration is pretty awesome.  You get dragged into the atmosphere so quickly because of the beautiful visuals and music.  And there are so many things you interact with and the Megatome's constant ""thought journal"" is just brilliant.  The ""Lunar Cycle"" system is also interesting for sure, and I kind of like how the entire game is kind of focused more on the ""spiritual experience"" it's trying to offer you.  It's unorthodox but very welcomed.The characters are all very fleshed out, and the narrator herself is charming and witty.  You really feel for her by the end of the journey because...well, I can't spoil but it 's some pretty heavy stuff.  The story isn't too explicit, but unlike titles like Limbo which left me wanting a lot more, Superbrothers just barely manages to quench the thirst.  I don't need to know more...I can simple assume and I'm totally fine with that.Honestly, I'd recommend Superbrothers if you got it in the Humble Bundle or if you can just grab it for cheap.  You can beat it in four or five hours or so, but you'll probably go back and play it a few times just because it's actually impossible to see everything in the first playthrough.  The music and visuals are worth the purchase on their own, so check this out if you want something different but very, very interesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First thing's first. See that title? Sword & Sworcery is an EP, not a game proper. It is music foremost and a storytelling experience second.Despite what you may think and hear, this game is far from pretentious, and one of few examples where people will point to when they say that games can be art. Here is one so accutely self-aware that it nearly transcends it.At its base, Sword & Sworcery is a wacky adventure tied onto a pretty nifty soundtrack. It is an experiment in modern storytelling and game design. A fruitful experiment, infusing music with puzzles and battles and decidedly not vice versa. The visuals, as you can already tell, are beyond stunning.S&S is a game that tells its story almost in a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek manner. At risk small of ruining the surprise, I will say this: it is exactly this silliness that both allows you to come even close to taking it seriously, and the cleverness that makes you appreciate it all the more.If the plot were presented in a serious manner, few would take it seriously and it would just seem as pretentious and obfuscated as Braid. It is the humour and quirkiness of the title that makes the story penetrable at all. Despite the jests, the story is even more compelling if you take it as being honest.Now here's the sad bits: this is not meant for the PC at all. Find yourself a touch screen copy of this game. It is not meant to be completed in one or two sittings. You are meant to pace yourself and take it in chunks, and you'll be more likely to finish the game that way.Missing the ending is something you do not want to do. That is when everything sinks in.

												This is a wonderful game with a unique atmosphere and gorgeous music. If you're the kind of person who requires constant stimulation and instant gratification, this game is not for you. If, however, you're the kind of person who can relax and look around and find the journey from A to B as important as getting to B, this game might be right up your alley. This is absolutely one of the best games I've ever played. If you can approach it with an open mind and a sense of wonder, it will repay those a hundred times over.			",80,40,0,8,4,0,5

												This game is beautifully different. It echoes such favorites as Zelda, but goes far beyond paying tribute. This game completely enmeshed me in its artistically pixelated world--not to mention stellar music by Jim Guthrie, which is as wonderful on its own as it is in-game. Not for someone looking for a technical challenge, as the combat system is intentionally simple to allow full immersion--that said, even the fight sequences are stunning. For anyone looking for a change of pace, or suffering from acute soul-sickness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Controversial review time. I do not recommend this game because it's more an artsy semi-storytelling adventure with pointless travelling back and forth to get to your objectives. Most of the game is frustrating ""find the right spot to tap"" puzzles, and the story is abstract and doesn't really make sense. So if you want to look at pixel graphics with an ok soundtrack, then pick it up. Otherwise, find something else to enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow... I owned this game for a long time before playing it. I had no idea what I was missing out on. Great retro adventure game, with an interesting story that isn't shoved down the players throat. The player is thrown into a world s/he knows nothing about, in a game where the mechanics are not explained by some boring tutorial or lame on-screen directions. Instead, the game cleverly introduces concept little by little, nudging the player to understand. Doing all of this, without being frustrating or annoying, rather keeping the player intrigued to know more.  Also great for casuals as it is divided up into sections that seem to take 30-45 minutes. GREAT GAME, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is one of the best games I have played this year. It's blend of lush, beautiful pixel art, engrossing sound effects and score, and intuitve gameplay sets the bar for indie games several pegs higher.Although the gameplay mechanics are designed for touch-enabled devices, I had no issues using a mouse to click, drag, and strum my way though game. The combat system was probably easier on touch, but I only encountered a few mis-clicks in my five-and-a-half hour playthrough.I believe it would be very easy for someone to beat this game for the first time in four hours, but I managed to get turned around a few times, especially in Session 3. The characters generally guide you along well enough to your next goal, though the hints can be quite cryptic at times. When I did finally find my way again, it was only then that I realized the true meaning.At its core, the indiekid/hipster vibe of this game will either make or break the experience for you. The vocal tracks, few and far between, remind me of more of a spaced-out Bill and Ted than one would expect from a game, and both the developers and sound/music guy Jim Guthrie managed to have cameos. I found these traits endearing, the final polish on an already unblemished game. If you find yourself allergic to alliteration (or pretentiousness), then you might have a hard time with this one.

												This game is one of those that just pulls you in and makes you like the characters and sort of get attached.  It is a fresh installment of a game in todays crazy, eccentric, gorey, shock value of games today.  It's completely in a league of it's own and the sound track is just absolutely amazing.  The fights are done well and overall the game is fun and tons of puzzles for you to solve.  I higly suggest this game to anyone looking to play a top of the line single player game and really get deep into it like the old days of great single player gaming.  I almost cried when the game was over.  Not just because it was over, but because a decision I had made allowed a special someone to be seen at a epic point in the game.Don't bother to look at the people who review and say its bad.  Look at what they say.  ""Bad"" because they aren't smart enough to write a real review.Also you get a badass sound track from the game.  Yes, it really is that badass you can go into you're game folder and take it out and listen to it like a CD.  Just awsome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I honestly don't know what to make of this game. It's cheap enough for anyone and everyone to give it a try and see if they like it. But I for one was not very impressed. The combat and puzzles are far too boring and easy (the puzzles practically solve themselves and that's without using mushrooms).The story, style and music are definitely the highlights of this game. But I've played indie games with better stories. Better music games and FAR better puzzle games. As well as indie games with better combat. So if those factors are not important to you, but just the 'journey' and 'adventure' (albeit a slow and boring one) then you might get some pleasure from this game.Oh and guest appearance of pedo bear in this game, wtf...

I could not recommend this any more! If you don't have it - buy it now and enjoy awesome gameplay, storyline and soundtrack!Old post: I was hesitating whether to buy this, because I'm not quite into point-and-click adventures/quests. A friend of mine was telling me the game is awesome and that I need to play it. So I thought now that it's the deal of the day, it's a good idea to go buy it.So I did. And wow! Just... WOW...I immediately played the introduction and am astounded. I don't have much to say, except that everybody has to play that game! And I mean EVERYBODY! Although I'm just in the beginning, I feel the story's gonna amaze me. The graphics are a true oldschool delight and the sounds/music... Oh, the music...

												More than a review, I just want to make a comment about this game. I have heard a lot of people (including critics) speak very positively about Superbrothers, but to be completely honest I just don't get it. Sure, the music is really good and it does an amazing job making you feel invested in the world. And definitely, the visual art is certainly very different from everything else out there. But I just don't think that this game is fun. I understand battles are secondary to what the game truly is, but they just felt very boring, since they just play out like quick-time events except with a mouse. Not to mention that the the whole sworcery sections were just clicks here and there, somewhat confusing and unappealing. I just did not find the puzzles as interesting as some people have said they were. All in all, Superbrothers feels like an unbalanced game. Stay for the ambient and music if you want to, cause there isn't that much else. There are better indie games out there.			",86,25,0,17,4,0,13

												Awful waste of a few pounds. Such a high metacritic score, so surely worth a bash, right? No. First I hated that it wanted me to sign into twitter all the time so it could advertise itself on my feed. Next, the story could possibly have been good, but you'd never know it from the awful 'ironic hipster' style of narration. It's as though a twelve year old stoner was given the job of writing the written cues. Whilst there's good music and a nice graphic style, the gameplay consists of walking around an incredibly repetative environment and clicking on every point, hoping to achieve something or figure out what the next step is by chance. Poor effort in making gameplay comparable to an actually playable game. I repeat; terrible 'game'. I'd reconsider the gaming credentials of anyone who considers this passable as a recommendation.

												S:S&S EP is an interesting, if short, adventure game.  One of the mechanics of the game allows you access to certain areas only during certain phases of the real-world moon, sertting the game up tp take longer by simply implying ""you can't get there now, come back later.""  The music, the stylized graphics, the storyline, everything is well-done.Verdict:  Definitely worth playing, but you might want to wait for a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Music: The soundtrack. The soundtrack the soundtrack the soundtrack. Soundtrack? The. Soundtrack.Sound Effects: I don't think I have ever commented on sound effects. I mean, voice acting, sure, but that to me is its own category. I also want to cater my chatter to the games themselves since oftentimes something stands out on its own and needs to be talked about. That said, the sound effects are crisp, elegant, real, magical. I think crisp is a delicious word; it makes me happy. Crisp. That was the first thing I thought of when I watched the Steam Release video. It carries throughout the game. Moments where there is little music are made vibrant by the sound effects. Not an ""oh I hear birds, how realistic"" or ""oh the people in the distant market, I can hear them!"" vibrancy. It goes deeper into an almost trance inducing simplistic beauty. It dances in your mind. It dances with your mind.Story: Simple. At least to me it wasn't terribly deep, but I admit that I didn't spend an enormous amount of time in the game. The writing is superb though. I was pulled into the mystery of the game mostly becasue I didn't feel I had to be playing the game to be a part of it. The story became part of my own. The woeful errand is mine.Gameplay (A): The controls and actual gameplay are brutally straightforward and it works. I felt good about accomplishing things but it was more of an ""Ah-ha! Got it!"" feeling than an ""I did it! I can't believe it! YEEEEAAAAHHHH!"" feeling. That said, the last part of the game gives you the latter feeling.Gameplay (B): The way it incorporates into life would have been more engaging if I used twitter. Still, this game got me to actually make a twitter account, so that was something. I haven't used twitter since, so...yeah. Anywho, even despite that element being wasted on this guy I found the way this ties into the real world to be the best thing ever. I am sure some people will think it is lame, but I loved it. I don't want to ruin it, you can always look it up if you want, but it is astronomy related. Nothing complex. Nothing you can't google your way into knowing. But I was enraptured.Graphics: Obviously not for everyone. I loved them. It manages to be pixel art while also being art. Not all pixel art games are terribly pretty, but this one is. Nostalgia doesn't even have much to do with it. It is an art style and I love what they have done with it.Overall: I bought it, obviously. I watched the release trailer and knew I had to. I am recommending it. I bought the soundtrack. I fell in love with the mystery and ambiance of this game. You could read a hundred reviews that say this is amazing and you may think it is insipid. I tend to buy indie and sale games that spark my interest. I love trying different games to find ones I like, but a lot of them I don't fall in love with and I am ok with that. If you want to invest some effort then look at my library, my reviews, and what I have spent time playing, then decide.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A 2D side-scroller of sorts, S&S:EP tells the story of a rather unremarkable character known only as the Scythian, who goes on a journey to capture three Trigon pieces and offer up the Megatome at the summit of a mountain.Let me start by noting immediately that the production value is definitely up there. The visuals and especially the soundtrack are top-notch and definitely a major selling point of the game. The story is weaker and nothing spectacular, but definitely acceptable.Where the game gets questionable is, well, the gameplay. It is not bad per se, but a lot of features in this game can be considered quite frustrating, from the mundane (tedious walking in between places) to the estoric (why do puzzles depend on real-life moon phases?). S&S:EP aims to be unique, and it seems that one will either find the gameplay brilliant and refreshing, or pretentious and merely annoying as hell.For this reason, if at all possible, my recommendation: try before you buy - this is not a game for everyone, not even a majority. I hesitantly list this as a ""yes"", but only because even in the absence of good gameplay, you can have a few pretty scenes and nice music for your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It plays very similarly to a point-and-click adventure especially in the sense that the game can be entirely played with the mouse, although the game's combat system (for the few times you actually fight stuff) is better utilized by the Z and X keys (Defend and Attack respectively).  So basically, it's a modern point-and-click adventure with awesome music.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome, short indie game that I enjoyed playing over about 5 or so gaming sessions. If Final Fantasy XIII was an interactive movie, you might say this was an interactive music video. The actual gameplay time you get out of it is not too long, and has little to no replay value. This game is all about experiencing the art and especially the music in relevance to the game. It IS called S&S EP for a reason, after all. All in all, I did enjoy the experience, and for a price of $3.99 including the soundtrack, I'm not complaining.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I honestly don't know what to make of this game. It's cheap enough for anyone and everyone to give it a try and see if they like it. But I for one was not very impressed. The combat and puzzles are far too boring and easy (the puzzles practically solve themselves and that's without using mushrooms).The story, style and music are definitely the highlights of this game. But I've played indie games with better stories. Better music games and FAR better puzzle games. As well as indie games with better combat. So if those factors are not important to you, but just the 'journey' and 'adventure' (albeit a slow and boring one) then you might get some pleasure from this game.Oh and guest appearance of pedo bear in this game, wtf...

												This is such a well crafted game, a journey to the past colliding with our present. A mix between an epic and a conceptual album. A great entry on point and click games genre, inspired by both classical and contemporary game design. And the soundtrack will blow you away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery is the long awaited port of the console game Dark Souls. While I don't quite understand the shift from 3D to equally attractive 2D, the game still holds up. I just wish the PVP and coop hadn't been removed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With the plethora of indie garbage floating around, there's very few titles that really stand out as being memorable. Sword & Sworcery EP is definitely one of those titles that stands out. It's a musical journey with epic gameplay, storytelling, sound effects, and music. I can't praise the sound effects and music enough--they make everything come together in spectacular fashion--it's gaming nirvana.Graphic-wise, the game isn't much to look at, but if you've ever played the original King's Quest, it's just an amazing throw-back to that era. Overall, Sword & Sworcery EP is a stunning adventure, both nostalgic and modern.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The premise is a puzzle based point and click, but it uses some very cool imagery and scenery to form many of the puzzles in the game. There is also a real world/dream world dynamic, where actions in the dream world effect the story and puzzles of the real world. It's a very surreal game that really makes you want to keep exploring it; and while the setting and retro graphics seem simple on the surface, the wonder and mystery of the world is not something you will have encountered before. I can see this game not being for everyone, as at times it can be a little slow and the 'next step' can be a little vague and require lots of wandering to figure out. I see this as a normal part of an adventure game and wasn't put off by it, but would understand if anyone had issues with it. If you have this game in your library, pop it on some evening where you just want a relaxed game night :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing the first 2 episodes I can say S&S: EP is a fun Adventure game.  I normally don't get into Adventure games; so for me that means something. They did a lot of work on the sound too. Recomend you play with headphones. If you like indie pop music you will enjoy this a little more than someone who doesn't like that genre. However not a bad game at all.			",386,137,2,93,46,4,74

												Before I get too indepth, this game has a lot of problems. Atmospherically, this game has a lot going for it. It's a beautiful experience with some mid-level challenging puzzles. It has a retro pixel graphical style and a super cool soundtrack that places the game in a strange fantasy world that's aware it is a game. Hence, the presence of The Director. While the game has a lot of elements that work for it - in fact, most of the elements work - it still feels a bit slipshod. Sometimes, the puzzles can get frustrating, too. With that said, it's interesting enough for anyone who enjoys the ol' point-and-click and wants to try one on acid.			",90,52,0,12,9,3,16

I mean, COME ON CAPY!!so yeah, not going to recommend this to anyone who values actual substance in the art they consume.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's slow at times, but for me that just allows you to enjoy the atmosphere and music that much more.  Some parts are frustrating because it can be difficult to figure out what to do next.  Much of the story is very esoteric, but that's what I like and part of what I enjoyed about the entire experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot of games are described in reviews with words like ""unique"", ""absorbing"", ""magical"" and the likes. Very few of them actually live up to such billing.

												Despite its relative age among other games (about five years as of writing this, counting the original iPad/iPhone release), Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP maintains an air of timelessness. Between its unique visuals, haunting tunes, and brief but legendary story, Sword & Sworcery EP remains a game that should, and likely will, be played again and again for years to come.Thrust with little to no explanation into the boots of the Scythian, Sword & Sworcery EP tasks you with recovering the tools necessary to thwart an ancient evil. It's not entirely clear just how happily the Scythian's tale will end, but it's clear it must be ended, one way or another. Despite taking place in a relatively small slice of a world, the environment reflects your progress, sometimes in great ways, sometimes more subtly, goading you silently on toward success. The subtle nature of said guidance often leaves the game feeling a bit confusing and the player wandering, to be fair. However, a careful eye and/or ear is often the key to overcoming obstacles, and if nothing else, just try everything.It doesn't help that the game's social media integration is far less effective now that the game is hardly new. Back during its release, progress reports and hints flowed somewhat steadily onto Twitter, as sent out by the game as players made headway. Now, that trickle has all but stopped, making a look or two at a guide to the game a necessary evil, albeit a forgivable one. This sort of integration with the real world was an interesting experiment, however, as was the game's recognition of our world's moon phases, as based on your system's date settings. If you can, try and complete the game without messing around with your clock; it feels more rewarding to have done so legitimately, with time to think about things between sessions.The game does quite a bit with a rather simple interface as well. Inputs are rather basic, which is to be expected given it was originally created for iOS devices before finding its way to the PC. Still, the timing-based action sequences can offer a bit of a challenge, as can finding the right paths to traverse between said segments.Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP flexes what many would consider the definition of a ""game,"" but does so deftly, and leaves the player with a unique experience to remember. Be it the melodies of the soundtrack or what the art direction was able to do with a fairly limited style, there's something for everyone to remember this by.			",836,398,38,114,89,9,112

												I love the art, and I can see what everyone likes about the music (didn't grab me that much to be honest though)But apart from that, I really can't recommend this game.Firstly, no attempt seems to have been made at all to translate the mobile-device interface to PC. It just doesn't work with a mouse. It's a horrible, unsatisfying experience.Secondly, the gameplay is threadbare. There is really not much to do in this game, and the puzzles are mostly arbitrary.Thirdly, the dialogue is groan-worthy. What you've heard about it is true - it's just hipster trash. Either ""ironically"" pseudo-intellectual nonsense, or ""ironically"" overly-hip and casual. Haha, real clever. I'm so impressed by your ""irony"",  but if you're going to be all ""too-clever-for-you"", make sure you actually have a point to make.Nope, don't really like it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably even better on a tablet but well ported to the PC, Sword and Sworcery EP is a bit of an art game that should be enjoyed with a nice glass of Merlot and a laid-back disposition. The music is sublime, the retro graphics perfect, while the game has a great quirky sense of humour and a simple, approachable plot that may have you in tears by its climax if you're willing to emotionally invest in it.It's hard to not reflect on how short a game it can be (especially if one attempting to speed-run it- which one shouldn't) and how it feels a bit like a well polished prototype or experiment of sorts, but every second of it was worthwhile and, to those of the right persuation, I cannot recommend this game enough.

												The music is very good, gameplay is simple, but the story is rather confusing and strange. It leaves a feeling of ""where do I go, and what do I do,"" and not in the good way. Some parts require it to be a certain day or time, and this can be frustrating. You can sometimes tell where you're supposed to go by reading people's thoughts, but other times it's rather pointless. It's something different, and very interesting, but something that you'll play once or twice before never touching again or finding a guide.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has a neat visual style and nice ambiance, but everytime I play this I can't not think 'pretentious art-game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t'. The eagerness of it wanting to tweet everything you do doesn't help either.It tries to be extremely simplistic by controlling everything with the mouse, but this leads to frustrations when it asks you to do more complex tasks than moving around. ""Wait so I click hold here, ok now something is glowing, and then click hold over here, and why is it not doing anything.... ""Oh and it returns to menu after every ""30 minute"" chapter, to encourage players to take a break. i don't mind this feature as I've usually had more than I would care for with the game by then.

												Fun game. I found it frustrating at first because I didn't realize the effect the moon phases have on the game. Once I figured that out it was all good. Not too hard. Great music. Sometimes I would just sit and listen to the music. The one downside for me is the battles are basically quick time events that involve clicking buttons instead of pressing a key on my keyboard which made things a little hard to get used to.

												The art style is really pretty and reminiscent of older point-n-click adventure games like The Dig or Loom, maybe with a little Out of This World thrown in.  It's not as cartoony as other games of the time like Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle.  The controls are a little weird and there are a lot of musical undertones connecting everything together which is what makes this game fresh.  Couple that with odd pseudo-intellectual psychobabble storytelling and the game does a nice job of holding one's interest, if only from the mystery.If I had to say anything negative, the controls are a bit...  counter-intuitive, and take awhile to learn but until then I found myself (and still do at times) randomly doing things with the mouse before I end up making what I want happen.  The action is rather minimalistic and a bit disjointed from the rest of the game, but it still remains fun, if not challenging at times.  Most of the game is along the lines of an interactive story, so the combat is kind of neat, not really seen in a point-n-click game like this before.As for the storytelling, I'm not sure what to say about it, other than I'm still on the fence.  The authors either wrote it to be extremely pretentious and artsy; or it's so convoluted with large vocabulary on purpose as to be an ironic means of giving the player little information while trying to remain vague and mysterious.  If it's the former, I'd rather not have any dialogue, because why say it when you can show it?  If it's the latter, they constantly break this rule by changing the writing style to be as blunt and directly open as possible at times, so you almost end up realizing that when small words are used it might be a real hint and you should pay some attention.  It makes the game come across like there are two or even three writers competing with each other as to how the game flows.  I think with just a little more work they could have done the entire game with no dialogue whatsoever, because the backgrounds, things, and musical sounds throughout the game change depending on what you're doing to them.  Then there's a weird ""feature"" where the game wants to tweet on your behalf to twitter.  I read that there's no point to this, so I guess it's just a blatant way of hyping up the game, which is kind of interesting, but if there's no reward then why do it?If you liked older point-n-click adventure games or used to slobber over everything Lucasarts, Tim Schafer, or Ron Gilbert pumped out in the '90s you'll enjoy this game.  It doesn't feel stale and it really does a great job of making you believe the world of the game exists, and you find yourself wondering how neat it would be to actually be there, wandering around exploring.

												This game stinks of hipster tryhard-i-ness. I bought it with the Humble Bundle V. I never thought to play it until now since I was sort of off put by the intentionally pixelated graphics. At first I thought, ""hey this game isn't so bad, it feels like a sort of DMT-zelda"". Then I realized, it literally is a terribly designed zelda game on acid with pretty music and admittedly well done graphics.The game is pretty minimalistic for PC, which only made more sense when I discovered it's an ipad game. And yet, the character dialogue basically hammers you in the face with ""THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY WIHTOUT SUBTLETY."" The dialogue seems like it was written by two hipsters part way through their degrees at Evergreen, too. Don't use ""mirite?"" in a dialogue, EVER.There's one part where the game's narrator tells you that the game's built-in twitter functionality (kill me now) may or may not play some role in one act, while the FAQ I was following said it does not. The game not only berates you time to time to tweet inane things that are happening which no one would get in the first place, but blatantly #lies to you in order to get you to advertise their game for free. For shame.The part that really drove me over the edge was a puzzle that involves actually waiting a week (or more!) for the right time to continue the story. ♥♥♥♥ this. I play games on my own time, not the developer's. The FAQ's solution was to change the date/time on my computer to fool the game (which then labels you as a cheater and makes it impossible to get a 100% rating). I tried moving the date by one day for a week both forwards and backwards from my current day with no result. What a waste of time. I've never been pushed to the edge to just straight up quit a game forever before.This game feels like an okay concept that was then designed by people who have a huge ego and a bizarre idea of what a game should be. I really can't believe this was bundled alongside Bastion, Limbo, Amnesia, and Psychonauts. Abysmal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My first impressions of Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP...I played through the first ""session"" and it was fun.  While this would look better on say my PS Vita, it is a little pixelated on my iMac at 2560x1440 resolution.  The game is presented in pixel art form at it's best and has a very unique look and charm to it.  The music is great and is the best part of the game.There is some combat, but it's not great.  It serves it's purpose.  Some people's reviews stated there wasn't much to do, but it's not that bad.  It's a small adventure (so far), but I have a feeling it will become a larger one once I get deeper into the game.Completing the first session was fun and I am only 17% done with the game.  It took about 30 minutes and I didn't go everywhere I could.  The story was cool and I suspect it isn't over yet!  I think I just opened a can of worms so to speak! lolAnyway, I got this on sale so I can recommend buying it at sale price, but I am not sure about full price yet… I'll let you know when I finish the game! :-)  So far it runs great and have not had any problems on my iMac! :-)Here are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system.

												With the plethora of indie garbage floating around, there's very few titles that really stand out as being memorable. Sword & Sworcery EP is definitely one of those titles that stands out. It's a musical journey with epic gameplay, storytelling, sound effects, and music. I can't praise the sound effects and music enough--they make everything come together in spectacular fashion--it's gaming nirvana.Graphic-wise, the game isn't much to look at, but if you've ever played the original King's Quest, it's just an amazing throw-back to that era. Overall, Sword & Sworcery EP is a stunning adventure, both nostalgic and modern.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The premise is a puzzle based point and click, but it uses some very cool imagery and scenery to form many of the puzzles in the game. There is also a real world/dream world dynamic, where actions in the dream world effect the story and puzzles of the real world. It's a very surreal game that really makes you want to keep exploring it; and while the setting and retro graphics seem simple on the surface, the wonder and mystery of the world is not something you will have encountered before. I can see this game not being for everyone, as at times it can be a little slow and the 'next step' can be a little vague and require lots of wandering to figure out. I see this as a normal part of an adventure game and wasn't put off by it, but would understand if anyone had issues with it. If you have this game in your library, pop it on some evening where you just want a relaxed game night :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They did a lot of work on the sound too. Recomend you play with headphones. If you like indie pop music you will enjoy this a little more than someone who doesn't like that genre. However not a bad game at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really something special. Clever, interesting and amazing aesthetic supported by a great soundtrack. It can be pretty mystifying at times and test your patience, but it's kinda the whole point. S:S&S EP thrives off its mysteries and esoteric puzzles.S:S&S EP really makes the most of less is more, a minimalist UI, just enough exposition to fill out the world, but leave room for wonder, and a measured tempo to let you enjoy and take notice of the small things.Best of all, paradoxically, it feels nostalgic while still feeling like something new. You get the sense while playing, that the people behind this game were moved by certain games from days past. For me, it's a pretty heartwarming experience, I got a real sense of the kind of joy and fond feelings these people must have felt for their influences.And really, that's what this game is about. It's about the kind of things you, the player, will go through. The kind of emotions you'll experience as you explore. It's all about you and the game's not shy about addressing you directly to reinforce this. If you can suspend your disbelief a little, you'll love this game. Not disbelief of the story, but your own cynicism.Believe.And if music be the food of love, play on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i have got to say this game is really differenti found the controls to be really irritating because it doesn't tell you anything, but i figured out how to move anyways.  the music is really good, and the artstyle reminds me of an animated action game of bit.trip runner or bit.trip beat.  the game is animated amazingly well, although i think some people might not like the puzzle aspect of this game.  i found the puzzles to be extremely vague and monotonous, but the parts that actually have action/battle sequences felt ""epic"", and i absolutely hate using that word, but it really is the only word to describe those sequences besides ""tense"" and having a sense of actually being a hero.and i'm only on the second chapter			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably even better on a tablet but well ported to the PC, Sword and Sworcery EP is a bit of an art game that should be enjoyed with a nice glass of Merlot and a laid-back disposition. The music is sublime, the retro graphics perfect, while the game has a great quirky sense of humour and a simple, approachable plot that may have you in tears by its climax if you're willing to emotionally invest in it.It's hard to not reflect on how short a game it can be (especially if one attempting to speed-run it- which one shouldn't) and how it feels a bit like a well polished prototype or experiment of sorts, but every second of it was worthwhile and, to those of the right persuation, I cannot recommend this game enough.

												Sword & Sworcery is a fantastic adventure game, with amazing graphics and sounds, breathtaking atmosphere and subtle storytelling. It is nothing like you ever played before, and probably never will be. It kidnaps you into a world of myths and dreams, so the only thing you have to bring with you while playing this is time and patience. Some puzzles might be a bit hard to see through, but ultimately what really counts in this game is the gaming experience itself. It creates an amazing atmosphere with so little material: the art, the animations, the sounds and the soundtrack and the story just fit perfectly together to create an impressive experience you won't forget that easy.So, if you search for a game which is simple, yet perfect and you enjoy subtle graphics and atmosphere then you should play this gem. Cause that's what it is, a gem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It may look just like a hipster-ish and pixelated agglomeration of a game, but surprisingly, it made the jump from touch devices to the ""big screen"" fairly well. There are a few puzzles, but you'll always know what to do, even without the game explicitly telling you what to do. The ending was a climactic and satisfying accumulation of my efforts, and it felt good to play it all the way through. The Twitter integration is annoying, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply stunning. Gaming at its best. Games like this come along once in a while and they should be played. Its that simple. Regardless of your game type preference, you should allow yourself at least once to play a game of this quality and conviction. Amazing composed soundtrack, complex ambient environment, clever and witty writing, story telling at its best. what an experience for something that looks so simple on the surface. Yes its a side scroller with puzzles and a tricky combat system. Nothing new there, but its much more than that. its an intelligent breath of fresh air in amongst the lazy pristine generic first person shooters and the bland big budget heavy hitters. check out my video below to get a feel for the basic mechanics of the game.

												I recommend this game as a cure for soul-sickness, though I did not participate in the social networking aspect this game provides. Bear in mind, this game was introduced in 2011, where video gaming was at it's peak with FPS stick honkey nonsense like CoD or GTA. There are only so many shooters you can participate in before you can put the controller down and ask yourself, what am I doing with my gaming experience?Protip: This is not a game that should be done in one setting. Give yourself some time, because curing trauma is not something that can be done in two hours. Focus on the moon and you'll be alright. Pros: -gorgeous art-stunning sound-intuitive mechanics-brilliant (albeit lacking in closure) narrativeCons:-the aforementioned narrative-mechanics can become repetetive, especially in boss battles-not meant to be played in a brief play through, otherwise repetetiveness will become a hindranceSeriously though, enjoy this experiment. And get that DLC, because the music alone is lovely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is a point-and-click adventure in which you are ""the Scythian"", a girl-warrior that has to find her way through ancient legends, shadows, dreams and reality, with help from a couple of people and ""dogfella"" (bark, bark). The game fully ""shines"" in its 8-bit graphics: this makes it ""old-fashioned"" compared to current games but this is part of the beauty of the game itself. You'll love or hate the graphical part: I loved it.    The music helps a lot in providing the right atmosphere for each part of the game. I discovered Jim Guthrie by playing at Sound Shapes on PSVita: the music here is very similar and enjoiable. On the negative side, there are moments in the game where you feel lost and the next objectives (or how to achieve them) are not 100% clear. This happens especially if you put away the game for few days.At the end I felt ... sad ... in finishing the game. If a game can raise this kind of emotions by putting together few pixels,well, the objective is reached. Overall I definitely recommend this game, but this cannot be valid for anyone approaching this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With the plethora of indie garbage floating around, there's very few titles that really stand out as being memorable. Sword & Sworcery EP is definitely one of those titles that stands out. It's a musical journey with epic gameplay, storytelling, sound effects, and music. I can't praise the sound effects and music enough--they make everything come together in spectacular fashion--it's gaming nirvana.Graphic-wise, the game isn't much to look at, but if you've ever played the original King's Quest, it's just an amazing throw-back to that era. Overall, Sword & Sworcery EP is a stunning adventure, both nostalgic and modern.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is short, and weird, and I love it.  Love the art, the music, the story, and how the three are tied together.  It is a game made with artistry and polish.  It's a port from iOS, but I thoroughly enjoyed it here on Steam regardless.  Gameplay is simple and unconventional.  Highly recommended for open-minded players who will enjoy a finely crafted, unique experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing the first 2 episodes I can say S&S: EP is a fun Adventure game.  I normally don't get into Adventure games; so for me that means something. They did a lot of work on the sound too. Recomend you play with headphones. If you like indie pop music you will enjoy this a little more than someone who doesn't like that genre. However not a bad game at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got really attracted to this game at first because of its art. Now it completely took me over with its original music and sounds -- not to mention its quirky style when it comes to text and words in the game. This is not a fast-paced game - but it leaves an impression deep enough to remember. All the while, I can only use one word to describe this game - eccentric. And I am not even sure if this should be called ""a game"". Hehe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is realy funky.  I mean, on a completely superfluous level, it's gorgeous.  The sprite art and scenery is so simple but so decorative and detailed.  It's an amazing look.  And Jim Guthrie's music is just the best part about the whole game.  I've never fallen in love with a game's music faster than I have with Superbrothers.The gameplay is hit and miss for me.  I liked the exploration aspect, but the puzzles are usually far from tricky and the combat is clearly made for touch-screen devices like Android of iOS.  The three Trigon ""boss fights"" are also all basically the same, and considering those are some of the only enemies you encounter in the game, it would have been nice to see some creativity.  That being said, I would imagine they wanted as little combat as possible, so maybe that's why?  I dunno.As I mentioned, the exploration is pretty awesome.  You get dragged into the atmosphere so quickly because of the beautiful visuals and music.  And there are so many things you interact with and the Megatome's constant ""thought journal"" is just brilliant.  The ""Lunar Cycle"" system is also interesting for sure, and I kind of like how the entire game is kind of focused more on the ""spiritual experience"" it's trying to offer you.  It's unorthodox but very welcomed.The characters are all very fleshed out, and the narrator herself is charming and witty.  You really feel for her by the end of the journey because...well, I can't spoil but it 's some pretty heavy stuff.  The story isn't too explicit, but unlike titles like Limbo which left me wanting a lot more, Superbrothers just barely manages to quench the thirst.  I don't need to know more...I can simple assume and I'm totally fine with that.Honestly, I'd recommend Superbrothers if you got it in the Humble Bundle or if you can just grab it for cheap.  You can beat it in four or five hours or so, but you'll probably go back and play it a few times just because it's actually impossible to see everything in the first playthrough.  The music and visuals are worth the purchase on their own, so check this out if you want something different but very, very interesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sword & Sworcery is a unique take on an old adventure platform game.  Its visuals are a throwback to the old days of 8-bit graphics but powered by today's powerhouse graphics processors.  To describe this game is difficult.  But its charm lies within its musical melodies and its simple adventure puzzle.  Its only drawback would be its length, as it is possible to finish the game in one sitting.  However, one should slowly progress through the game to soak in all the visual and audio beauty.

												I had pretty high expectations for this game and it mostly delivered.  The gameplay itself is pretty basic: movement is done by double clicking a place on the screen and combat has only two buttons (attack or block).   Most of the odd controls are due to the game being an iOS port, but beyond the odd phrasing of the tutorial the controls are pretty decent.  The game gets better when it starts giving you puzzles: early on you unlock the power to ""sing"" and can interact with the environment to progress.  Mostly this boils down to clicking on the screen like a maniac until you figure out the order of things to press but there are few times where the game actually surprises you beyond the cookie-cutter puzzles that are introduced at the start of the game.  However, the story more than makes up for the decent gameplay.  The game presents you with a fairly original fantasy universe where most of the lore is told in the background.  Once you finish the first act, you gain access to a device that allows you to see what other characters think about the events going on; this gives more lore and occasionally hints about how to progress.  Our universe's lingo mixes in occasionally: words like ""upload"" find their way into the dialogue and help create a mix of fantasy and contemporary.  The game surprised me with its unique sense of humor as well; the game is narrated in first person and this often leads to humorous self-revelations.  The game is a visual treat with its stylized and elongated pixel characters and rich backgrounds.  Of course the music is also incredible: the game was made with the music in mind and it shows.  The game took me around 4.5 hours, which is decently long for a cheap indie game.  It doesn’t lend itself to be replayed, although there are a few easter eggs you may miss on your first run through.  The game splits itself into 4 parts; the third part notably takes a whole lunar month to complete (unless you are a cheater).  I suggest you follow the game’s recommendation to take a break between acts; it helps break the sometimes repetitive gameplay.  Overall, it’s worth the asking price and is for sure a buy if it goes on sale for $5 or less.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is a unique game (if it can be called a game). It's more of an experience? The main focus is not the game itself but the pixel art and the clever use of sound and music. The music always matches the mood of the action giving you upbeat and epic tunes during battles and soft ambient tunes during exploration. In fact, battles were my favorite parts of the game (though there were few). They battles are simple patterns of attack and defense but they still prove to be fun and sometimes a bit intense. While there are some definite good aspects of this game, there are other aspects that have me torn and make this game somewhat difficult to recommend. First of all, when playing this game, you have to remember that it was intended for mobile devices and tablets. I didn't understand that at first and was instantly frustrated with the controls. Touching and tapping has been replaced with mouse controls. It's still a bit confusing but you get used to it. My second gripe is that you as a player have very little idea of who your character is, what she is doing, and why (you understand more towards the end but for most of the game, you will be confused). It's important to check your surroundings, interact with characters, and listen to what they say (though they can be deliberately cryptic at times). This bring me to my next complaint... This game works fine, it looks good but there was something that kept bothering me and I couldn't quite figure it out until a couple of other users pointed it out in their own reviews. The game feels pretentious. Something about the overall presentation... The flashing of the game's title every now and then in-game, the flowery language of the archetype narrator, the fact that your character is known a ""The Scythian"" while other characters get names like ""Logfella""... It's difficult to place the blame on one aspect but something is not quite right about this game's overall atmosphere. Overall, this is not a bad game. And maybe I'm wrong and this atmosphere was not the intention of the game's developers. So if you're into point-and-click, adventure, and music type things... Then give Sword & Sworcery a try and decide for yourself. It's a unique experience that you won't find elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was very enthusiastic and looked forward to playing this game. With it's fantastic music, artwork and mystical mood.. I was very optimistic and quickly forgave the clunky controls. But... that was it..You wander around a bit and spend the entirety of the game grinding repetitive (click-it till you win-it) quests. I didn't even have a chance to get even slightly attached to the characters. By the ending I felt a little let down. I'm going to keep the music, and enjoy some wallpaper, but the game is done.

												You are thrown into a new world with absolutely no explanation, and you're left to figure things out. That said, the intro dungeon is extremely exciting, and reminds me a lot of Indiana Jones. Brilliantly done, because at this point you're new to the game and you have no idea what's happening. You know you should run, but can you fight? The devs wouldn't kill you off right away, right? Maybe they would...It's a great opener!! Definitely lots of suspense in the first part. The rest of the game is very quest/adventure like, and is a nice pace, ~5 hours. Great ambiance, and neat little puzzles without much guidance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you can get around the mouthful of a name and the strange idea that the creators thought re-tweeting lines from the game would help people solve the relatively simple puzzles, this is one of the best sounding point-and-click adventure games ever made. With a retro take on a unique art direction complimenting it, you'll marvel at the moods Guthrie spun into this soundtrack. I'd recommend playing this on a touchscreen instead of with a mouse if you have the option, but the PC port holds up. As long as you don't expect to finish it in a single sitting, S:S&SEP makes for a funny and quirky quest to dive into whenever the calendar cooperates.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game with the indie Humble Bundle V, I believe. I've played it for 4 hours or so. The game is a rpg/fantasy game that really emphazises on atmosphere with it's original sounds and tones. You don't feel like you're playing a game, you feel like you are part of a dream, the music and art are that good. The combat and ""boss"" battle are nothing crazy, you can also feel that the game was made for iphones/ipads to begin with. Overall, it's a truly unique gaming experience, try it if you really want something different. I'll give this game a solid 7/10, there isn't that much of replayability to it, though.

												My first impressions of Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP...I played through the first ""session"" and it was fun.  While this would look better on say my PS Vita, it is a little pixelated on my iMac at 2560x1440 resolution.  The game is presented in pixel art form at it's best and has a very unique look and charm to it.  The music is great and is the best part of the game.There is some combat, but it's not great.  It serves it's purpose.  Some people's reviews stated there wasn't much to do, but it's not that bad.  It's a small adventure (so far), but I have a feeling it will become a larger one once I get deeper into the game.Completing the first session was fun and I am only 17% done with the game.  It took about 30 minutes and I didn't go everywhere I could.  The story was cool and I suspect it isn't over yet!  I think I just opened a can of worms so to speak! lolAnyway, I got this on sale so I can recommend buying it at sale price, but I am not sure about full price yet… I'll let you know when I finish the game! :-)  So far it runs great and have not had any problems on my iMac! :-)Here are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system.

												Music: The soundtrack. The soundtrack the soundtrack the soundtrack. Soundtrack? The. Soundtrack.Sound Effects: I don't think I have ever commented on sound effects. I mean, voice acting, sure, but that to me is its own category. I also want to cater my chatter to the games themselves since oftentimes something stands out on its own and needs to be talked about. That said, the sound effects are crisp, elegant, real, magical. I think crisp is a delicious word; it makes me happy. Crisp. That was the first thing I thought of when I watched the Steam Release video. It carries throughout the game. Moments where there is little music are made vibrant by the sound effects. Not an ""oh I hear birds, how realistic"" or ""oh the people in the distant market, I can hear them!"" vibrancy. It goes deeper into an almost trance inducing simplistic beauty. It dances in your mind. It dances with your mind.Story: Simple. At least to me it wasn't terribly deep, but I admit that I didn't spend an enormous amount of time in the game. The writing is superb though. I was pulled into the mystery of the game mostly becasue I didn't feel I had to be playing the game to be a part of it. The story became part of my own. The woeful errand is mine.Gameplay (A): The controls and actual gameplay are brutally straightforward and it works. I felt good about accomplishing things but it was more of an ""Ah-ha! Got it!"" feeling than an ""I did it! I can't believe it! YEEEEAAAAHHHH!"" feeling. That said, the last part of the game gives you the latter feeling.Gameplay (B): The way it incorporates into life would have been more engaging if I used twitter. Still, this game got me to actually make a twitter account, so that was something. I haven't used twitter since, so...yeah. Anywho, even despite that element being wasted on this guy I found the way this ties into the real world to be the best thing ever. I am sure some people will think it is lame, but I loved it. I don't want to ruin it, you can always look it up if you want, but it is astronomy related. Nothing complex. Nothing you can't google your way into knowing. But I was enraptured.Graphics: Obviously not for everyone. I loved them. It manages to be pixel art while also being art. Not all pixel art games are terribly pretty, but this one is. Nostalgia doesn't even have much to do with it. It is an art style and I love what they have done with it.Overall: I bought it, obviously. I watched the release trailer and knew I had to. I am recommending it. I bought the soundtrack. I fell in love with the mystery and ambiance of this game. You could read a hundred reviews that say this is amazing and you may think it is insipid. I tend to buy indie and sale games that spark my interest. I love trying different games to find ones I like, but a lot of them I don't fall in love with and I am ok with that. If you want to invest some effort then look at my library, my reviews, and what I have spent time playing, then decide.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Eight bucks for a CD's worth of prog rock in MP3, and an odd little adventure game that uses it for a soundtrack. Hard to go wrong there (unless you hate prog and love King's Quest). As a game, it's more a 'wanderer' or 'explorer' than 'adventure' title: the puzzles are simple, and relatively few, and the fight scenes aren't too difficult once you've got the enemy's rather obvious tells down.

												really an incredible experience.  It not only looks gorgeous, but sounds gorgeous too.  As simple as the gameplay is, it is still satisfying and rewarding.  I found the storyline quite intreguing, despite how simple it seems on the surface, and the characters seemed believable and i enjoyed spending time with them.  This game manages to have a sense of humor despite being so artsy, and often unsettling.  An excellent example of storytelling through gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game by far is one of the most well made modern 16 bit exploration games out there. It fills you with a sense of awe that fure games can with Pixel translated worlds, The writing is humorous with out being to foward, and the music, composed by Jim Munrou, is some of the best videogame soundtracks, interactive as well. For the price of ten dollars, sit back, relax, fight, and explore the world of Sword and Sworcery.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is a great, beautiful game!The beautiful landscape, combined with a great soundtrack creates a great atmosphere and that makes the game an unforgettable experience.The game takes you to a mythic land with little clue of what's going on, so it's a bit confusing at first. You explore this land and the story develops nicely. You even get to slash misteryous monsters with your sword and maybe they'll drop a thing, or two.On Session III, you'll be introduced to a very interesting game mechanic which involves moon phases. Of course, if you do not wish to wait for the next full moon, you can bypass this by being a Cheating Cheater or just believing in your dreams :) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awful waste of a few pounds. Such a high metacritic score, so surely worth a bash, right? No. First I hated that it wanted me to sign into twitter all the time so it could advertise itself on my feed. Next, the story could possibly have been good, but you'd never know it from the awful 'ironic hipster' style of narration. It's as though a twelve year old stoner was given the job of writing the written cues. Whilst there's good music and a nice graphic style, the gameplay consists of walking around an incredibly repetative environment and clicking on every point, hoping to achieve something or figure out what the next step is by chance. Poor effort in making gameplay comparable to an actually playable game. I repeat; terrible 'game'. I'd reconsider the gaming credentials of anyone who considers this passable as a recommendation.

												Wow... I owned this game for a long time before playing it. I had no idea what I was missing out on. Great retro adventure game, with an interesting story that isn't shoved down the players throat. The player is thrown into a world s/he knows nothing about, in a game where the mechanics are not explained by some boring tutorial or lame on-screen directions. Instead, the game cleverly introduces concept little by little, nudging the player to understand. Doing all of this, without being frustrating or annoying, rather keeping the player intrigued to know more.  Also great for casuals as it is divided up into sections that seem to take 30-45 minutes. GREAT GAME, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is one of the best games I have played this year. It's blend of lush, beautiful pixel art, engrossing sound effects and score, and intuitve gameplay sets the bar for indie games several pegs higher.Although the gameplay mechanics are designed for touch-enabled devices, I had no issues using a mouse to click, drag, and strum my way though game. The combat system was probably easier on touch, but I only encountered a few mis-clicks in my five-and-a-half hour playthrough.I believe it would be very easy for someone to beat this game for the first time in four hours, but I managed to get turned around a few times, especially in Session 3. The characters generally guide you along well enough to your next goal, though the hints can be quite cryptic at times. When I did finally find my way again, it was only then that I realized the true meaning.At its core, the indiekid/hipster vibe of this game will either make or break the experience for you. The vocal tracks, few and far between, remind me of more of a spaced-out Bill and Ted than one would expect from a game, and both the developers and sound/music guy Jim Guthrie managed to have cameos. I found these traits endearing, the final polish on an already unblemished game. If you find yourself allergic to alliteration (or pretentiousness), then you might have a hard time with this one.

												Instead of trying to come up with a way to describe my experience with this game, I'll just quote a very succinct 'Rock, Paper, Shotgun' review:'Adventure game for stoners' --- 'It could come across as being embarrassed of what it is, except its more like shyness. As in, what it’s talking about is too important to be approached directly and crassly. You have to joke about it, because if you took it seriously, it’ll shatter.' --- 'And, to state the obvious, it’s certainly playing a whole bunch of games with Miyamoto’s icons.' 4 hours of tripping out!

												Spectacular game. Really deep. A bit weird to get in to (I didn't the first time around), perhaps due to the art style or the controls, but when you give it a chance the story becomes the primary motivation for completion. It makes you think a little; gives an interesting perspective of Dreams, Life, & Death.The music is a perfect compliment.On a lighter note, I do love how there's an achievement that unlocks if you're a cheater.. had to start a 2nd game just to cheat for it (but I made sure to unlock that one last). :P Cost wise, It's inexpensive, too! Came down to roughly $1/hr having taken my time. Not a lot of downsides!Fairly short (100% + 14/14 Achievements in 7hrs), but overall I'm happy with it. Achievement wise, 2 of them are very difficult to achieve.The ending? ... Oh, the ending. It made it all worth it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For minimum disappointment, S:S&S EP should be treated, as its title suggests, as an Extended Play record. Expect a relatively passive experience, to be enjoyed multiple times, filled with sumptuous (and detailed) pixel art, lashings of style, a hint of story, as well as excellent and atmospheric music. What you shouldn't expect is a whole lot of interaction. Most of the time, you'll be exploring the world, figuring out where and how to advance the story.You may notice the sword and shield in some of the screen shots. Yes, there are battles, but there aren't many of them. Don't come into this thinking it's some kind of action RPG. It's most certainly not. It's a game about exploration and atmosphere. If you treat it this way, you won't be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sometimes I would just sit and listen to the music. The one downside for me is the battles are basically quick time events that involve clicking buttons instead of pressing a key on my keyboard which made things a little hard to get used to.

The plot is unique but easy to follow and become immersed in. It is a visual and audio experience. There's a little bit of brain work and timing needed, otherwise, it is all an adventure, exploring an unseen world.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sword & Sworcery is a unique take on an old adventure platform game.  Its visuals are a throwback to the old days of 8-bit graphics but powered by today's powerhouse graphics processors.  To describe this game is difficult.  But its charm lies within its musical melodies and its simple adventure puzzle.  Its only drawback would be its length, as it is possible to finish the game in one sitting.  However, one should slowly progress through the game to soak in all the visual and audio beauty.

												I had pretty high expectations for this game and it mostly delivered.  The gameplay itself is pretty basic: movement is done by double clicking a place on the screen and combat has only two buttons (attack or block).   Most of the odd controls are due to the game being an iOS port, but beyond the odd phrasing of the tutorial the controls are pretty decent.  The game gets better when it starts giving you puzzles: early on you unlock the power to ""sing"" and can interact with the environment to progress.  Mostly this boils down to clicking on the screen like a maniac until you figure out the order of things to press but there are few times where the game actually surprises you beyond the cookie-cutter puzzles that are introduced at the start of the game.  However, the story more than makes up for the decent gameplay.  The game presents you with a fairly original fantasy universe where most of the lore is told in the background.  Once you finish the first act, you gain access to a device that allows you to see what other characters think about the events going on; this gives more lore and occasionally hints about how to progress.  Our universe's lingo mixes in occasionally: words like ""upload"" find their way into the dialogue and help create a mix of fantasy and contemporary.  The game surprised me with its unique sense of humor as well; the game is narrated in first person and this often leads to humorous self-revelations.  The game is a visual treat with its stylized and elongated pixel characters and rich backgrounds.  Of course the music is also incredible: the game was made with the music in mind and it shows.  The game took me around 4.5 hours, which is decently long for a cheap indie game.  It doesn’t lend itself to be replayed, although there are a few easter eggs you may miss on your first run through.  The game splits itself into 4 parts; the third part notably takes a whole lunar month to complete (unless you are a cheater).  I suggest you follow the game’s recommendation to take a break between acts; it helps break the sometimes repetitive gameplay.  Overall, it’s worth the asking price and is for sure a buy if it goes on sale for $5 or less.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, this is a must-play for anyone who doesn't demand ALL ACTION, ALL THE TIME. Secondly, it barely qualifies as a ""game"" at all, by today's standards.

There's some very, very light puzzling present here, and you do get into very light combat now and then, but the main ideas in play here are some freakin' outstanding sounds and music, a sense of wonder, truly unique beauty, and (what I consider to be) an incredible story. Look, listen, tip-tap, and be the smartest. Don't pass over this ""game.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sword & Sworcery has great sound design, and has some neat deliberate point and click gameplay. Feels a bit slow at times responding, but it is fairly good for an iOS port. And the plot, whilst wrapped in hipsterish semi-detatched jargon, explores elements of Jungian pyschology, questions about restraint and patience, and making deliberate action. Overall would recommend... Sorry that it has been a long while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game stinks of hipster tryhard-i-ness. I bought it with the Humble Bundle V. I never thought to play it until now since I was sort of off put by the intentionally pixelated graphics. At first I thought, ""hey this game isn't so bad, it feels like a sort of DMT-zelda"". Then I realized, it literally is a terribly designed zelda game on acid with pretty music and admittedly well done graphics.The game is pretty minimalistic for PC, which only made more sense when I discovered it's an ipad game. And yet, the character dialogue basically hammers you in the face with ""THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY WIHTOUT SUBTLETY."" The dialogue seems like it was written by two hipsters part way through their degrees at Evergreen, too. Don't use ""mirite?"" in a dialogue, EVER.There's one part where the game's narrator tells you that the game's built-in twitter functionality (kill me now) may or may not play some role in one act, while the FAQ I was following said it does not. The game not only berates you time to time to tweet inane things that are happening which no one would get in the first place, but blatantly #lies to you in order to get you to advertise their game for free. For shame.The part that really drove me over the edge was a puzzle that involves actually waiting a week (or more!) for the right time to continue the story. ♥♥♥♥ this. I play games on my own time, not the developer's. The FAQ's solution was to change the date/time on my computer to fool the game (which then labels you as a cheater and makes it impossible to get a 100% rating). I tried moving the date by one day for a week both forwards and backwards from my current day with no result. What a waste of time. I've never been pushed to the edge to just straight up quit a game forever before.This game feels like an okay concept that was then designed by people who have a huge ego and a bizarre idea of what a game should be. I really can't believe this was bundled alongside Bastion, Limbo, Amnesia, and Psychonauts. Abysmal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You explore this land and the story develops nicely. You even get to slash misteryous monsters with your sword and maybe they'll drop a thing, or two.On Session III, you'll be introduced to a very interesting game mechanic which involves moon phases. Of course, if you do not wish to wait for the next full moon, you can bypass this by being a Cheating Cheater or just believing in your dreams :) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An amazing art style and tone mixed with an always-intuitive feel of the old point-and-click adventures of the 90s. I can't recommend this one enough for someone who has the patience for a very subtle story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a truly unique experience.  I'm not entirely sure what to say about it.  The soundtrack is really great and the gameplay is good.  Some of the action sequences are a little repetitive, but not enough to spoil the experience by any means.  I highly recommend this one to any lovers of adventure and/or music.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wholeheartedly recommend this game to... pretty much everyone. Gamers, non-gamers. The controls are simple but the depth lies in the mystery, the dialogue, and the amazing music. One of my favorite gaming experiences of a long time. If they do any more, I'll immediately be on board.			",194,49,3,16,10,4,30

												This game is realy funky.  I mean, on a completely superfluous level, it's gorgeous.  The sprite art and scenery is so simple but so decorative and detailed.  It's an amazing look.  And Jim Guthrie's music is just the best part about the whole game.  I've never fallen in love with a game's music faster than I have with Superbrothers.The gameplay is hit and miss for me.  I liked the exploration aspect, but the puzzles are usually far from tricky and the combat is clearly made for touch-screen devices like Android of iOS.  The three Trigon ""boss fights"" are also all basically the same, and considering those are some of the only enemies you encounter in the game, it would have been nice to see some creativity.  That being said, I would imagine they wanted as little combat as possible, so maybe that's why?  I dunno.As I mentioned, the exploration is pretty awesome.  You get dragged into the atmosphere so quickly because of the beautiful visuals and music.  And there are so many things you interact with and the Megatome's constant ""thought journal"" is just brilliant.  The ""Lunar Cycle"" system is also interesting for sure, and I kind of like how the entire game is kind of focused more on the ""spiritual experience"" it's trying to offer you.  It's unorthodox but very welcomed.The characters are all very fleshed out, and the narrator herself is charming and witty.  You really feel for her by the end of the journey because...well, I can't spoil but it 's some pretty heavy stuff.  The story isn't too explicit, but unlike titles like Limbo which left me wanting a lot more, Superbrothers just barely manages to quench the thirst.  I don't need to know more...I can simple assume and I'm totally fine with that.Honestly, I'd recommend Superbrothers if you got it in the Humble Bundle or if you can just grab it for cheap.  You can beat it in four or five hours or so, but you'll probably go back and play it a few times just because it's actually impossible to see everything in the first playthrough.  The music and visuals are worth the purchase on their own, so check this out if you want something different but very, very interesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loved this game. It has that dreamy, slightly surreal quality I used to love in old 8-bit games together with that 'epic' feeling (probably due to the Jungian alchemical references and prog-space rock soundtrack). It's a wonderful soundtrack too. The game just made me feel 'happy' for some reason. Plus it's on Linux. Only bad points are minor: controls a bit weird, plus a tad short, but hey, it's not very expensive. Currently replaying :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow... I owned this game for a long time before playing it. I had no idea what I was missing out on. Great retro adventure game, with an interesting story that isn't shoved down the players throat. The player is thrown into a world s/he knows nothing about, in a game where the mechanics are not explained by some boring tutorial or lame on-screen directions. Instead, the game cleverly introduces concept little by little, nudging the player to understand. Doing all of this, without being frustrating or annoying, rather keeping the player intrigued to know more.  Also great for casuals as it is divided up into sections that seem to take 30-45 minutes. GREAT GAME, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I saw this game and thought, ""Oh hey, it looks like the game from the movie Big."" And that's the main reason I bought this. It's a cool game. I wouldn't say fun so much as interesting. It was fun to try and find all of the cool things hidden in the game (especially changing the phases of the moon to solve puzzles). I enjoyed my time with the game, I'm still not sure what exactly was going on with it (the record thing was odd), but it was enjoyable. I will say that there are a couple of really annoying things in the game. The first is that it kept telling me to take a break and the other is that it wanted me to tweet from the game. I'm old enough to know when I should take a break, and I'm not all that interested in sending out pre written tweets from a game. Thankfully both can be bypassed pretty easily.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know it makes me sound like a hipster, but I love the games that turn into more of an ""experience."" This is one of those games. There's a guy that, when you talk to him, just plays you a song. You can leave the screen anytime you want. But you can also choose to sit down and just listen. You don't listen to him so you can progress the story. You did it just beause you feel like hearing a song. Awesome!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Controversial review time. I do not recommend this game because it's more an artsy semi-storytelling adventure with pointless travelling back and forth to get to your objectives. Most of the game is frustrating ""find the right spot to tap"" puzzles, and the story is abstract and doesn't really make sense. So if you want to look at pixel graphics with an ok soundtrack, then pick it up. Otherwise, find something else to enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before I get too indepth, this game has a lot of problems. Atmospherically, this game has a lot going for it. It's a beautiful experience with some mid-level challenging puzzles. It has a retro pixel graphical style and a super cool soundtrack that places the game in a strange fantasy world that's aware it is a game. Hence, the presence of The Director. While the game has a lot of elements that work for it - in fact, most of the elements work - it still feels a bit slipshod. Sometimes, the puzzles can get frustrating, too. With that said, it's interesting enough for anyone who enjoys the ol' point-and-click and wants to try one on acid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sort of a point-and-click game, largely based around music and sound design.  Sort of like Journey, in that it's as much an experience as a game.  But with very limited 8-16 bit graphics as art design that are very much in keeping with the minimalism.  Part of the game is figuring out how the interface works and how puzzles are supposed to be solved.  It's short, and I ran the range while playing it from thinking it was super simplistic to thinking the design aspect of it and the entire concept was transcendent brilliance, and then I was somewhat disappointed by a kind of abrupt ending that brought the game down a point or two for me.

												Very nice audio effects, and relatively good looking pixel art game. But I would not recommend it. You don't do much in this game other than walk around and listen to music and try to get a little bit from the story. There are a few ""puzzles"", but nothing substantial. The text tries to be funny with snarky text, but doesnt really get the humor across. The controls are highly clunky, and the game is difficult to control.I found this game boring, with not a good story. I would give it 2/5 stars for its beautiful music and immersional sound			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of those rare creations that feels like a bright flash in the midnight sky.  Not everyone is going to see it, but those who do will remember it until they die.The visuals make me think Zelda and feel Loom.  The music is some of the best this side of Hotline Miami and it has a perfect organic fit with the rest of the game. Though the story seems to take place in a dream world, references to real places and ancient people make it feel like it could have really happened. People who love language will love the writing.  I often found myself reading the lines out loud because they were so much fun to say.  I think the greatest success of the game is its ability to invite the player's imagination into the experience.My only small criticism is that the original's touch controls don't always translate perfectly to the mouse, but I hardly cared because I was too busy having a great time.

												Here's the deal: I liked this game. Yeah, it's a mobile game ported to PC and that does mean it isn't technically flawless. But man, I remember staying up in a room with no air conditioning in the middle of summer playing it and being like...two hours late for something because I wanted to finish this in one sitting.  I think I was meeting Mike for something. Mike, I'm sorry. On the whole it's a really well made and fun adventure game that does a fantastic job at telling its story in a world that's filled to bursting with mysterious and enticing tone. The whole experience is truly evocative; a quest that will somehow lead you straight to peril, a la Shadow of the Colossus. The story itself is compelling and the game does a wonderful job of doing as much storytelling through the beautifully realized environments and haunting sound design as it does through actual text. And here's the cool thing about that. Sword and Sworcery swings almost all of its weight in those departments to create an engrossing experience. Why do I care about the world? Because it's simultaneously beautiful and enticing, it beckons for you to explore it. How do I know it's not just goofy? Because the music and the design of each area inform you of the mood there, you can tell when you're supposed to chuckle and when you're supposed to be on edge. Why do you press on? Because it looks like a quest-y video game, what else would you do?Where does it fall apart? That's why I want you to play it. Personally, I think the narrator breaking things up is a bit to cheeky for the tone of the game (at least as I remember it almost a year later). Yeah, some of the combat controls are a little wonky, yeah the movement can be a teeny bit frustrating. But really, I want you to play this. I want you to understand what good design is: bringing all aspects of the experience together to create something that you want to spend time with, characters you feel for even if you don't know them well, and provide you with a story that you remember vividly enough to tell your little nephew at a camping trip 6 months after finishing it. It'll provide you with that wide-eyed childlike joy of exploration and the bittersweet joy of completion. If this does convince you to buy the game, message me after it's done. I want to talk about it. So bad. ",123,49,3,35,16,2,31

												Fun game. I found it frustrating at first because I didn't realize the effect the moon phases have on the game. Once I figured that out it was all good. Not too hard. Great music. Sometimes I would just sit and listen to the music. The one downside for me is the battles are basically quick time events that involve clicking buttons instead of pressing a key on my keyboard which made things a little hard to get used to.

												I hate point and click adventure games but managed to play through this one entirely without anyone coercing me. The art is absolutely amazing, and the music is pretty good too. The storyline was a bit silly, but I actually felt a little bad during the ending...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply stunning. Gaming at its best. Games like this come along once in a while and they should be played. Its that simple. Regardless of your game type preference, you should allow yourself at least once to play a game of this quality and conviction. Amazing composed soundtrack, complex ambient environment, clever and witty writing, story telling at its best. what an experience for something that looks so simple on the surface. Yes its a side scroller with puzzles and a tricky combat system. Nothing new there, but its much more than that. its an intelligent breath of fresh air in amongst the lazy pristine generic first person shooters and the bland big budget heavy hitters. check out my video below to get a feel for the basic mechanics of the game.

												Pixels ! Art ! A story ! A heroine ! The music ! The ending !Sword & Sworcery is the story of a heroine who unwantedly unleashed a horror upon the world and has to put things right again, whatever it might take.Pros: - easy controls- good storyline- great use of pixels- great suitable music- the rare synergy between the visuals & the music elevates the game even to a higher level- it's an experience that remainsCons:- triggerfingers, dust eaters & action(wo)men beware. This might not be your average cup of tea.- short- replayabilityA huge recommendation for those who just seek THAT something special to experience . . .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Perfect mix of adventure/puzzle solving.  Very reminsecent of the old school point and click adventure type games, except modernized with a good story and great music.  The game is also availble on the I Pad (and i guess it is cheaper there too) so that is an option as well.  The game has a unique art and music style that flows together really well.  For some people the game may be too ""artsy"" for their liking, and it is certainly only going to take a couple of hours to complete, so I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. If you are into old school point and click adventure/puzzle games and slightly artsy independant games, I would recommend this game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got really attracted to this game at first because of its art. Now it completely took me over with its original music and sounds -- not to mention its quirky style when it comes to text and words in the game. This is not a fast-paced game - but it leaves an impression deep enough to remember. All the while, I can only use one word to describe this game - eccentric. And I am not even sure if this should be called ""a game"". Hehe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not so much a game as an experience. While the gameplay isn't much to speak of (point-and-click adventure with some minor puzzle and rhythm elements), the visuals and soundtrack are magnificent, and the strange, minimalist story is surprisingly enchanting. May come across as a little pretentious at times, so be warned...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that I would classify more as an interactive fiction than a game; the story, art style, and music certainly make S:S&SEP worthwhile but the gameplay is lacking. The gameplay consists of annoying point-and-click controls, confusing puzzle mechanics (though the puzzles are solved easily) and a lack of replayablitity. It only took me 4.3 hours to complete the game and to get all of the achievements, so if you're looking for value I would wait until it's on sale. I would recomend this to those who are looking for an interesting (albiet short) story, but playing this game has not impacted me significantly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is one of the best games I have played this year. It's blend of lush, beautiful pixel art, engrossing sound effects and score, and intuitve gameplay sets the bar for indie games several pegs higher.Although the gameplay mechanics are designed for touch-enabled devices, I had no issues using a mouse to click, drag, and strum my way though game. The combat system was probably easier on touch, but I only encountered a few mis-clicks in my five-and-a-half hour playthrough.I believe it would be very easy for someone to beat this game for the first time in four hours, but I managed to get turned around a few times, especially in Session 3. The characters generally guide you along well enough to your next goal, though the hints can be quite cryptic at times. When I did finally find my way again, it was only then that I realized the true meaning.At its core, the indiekid/hipster vibe of this game will either make or break the experience for you. The vocal tracks, few and far between, remind me of more of a spaced-out Bill and Ted than one would expect from a game, and both the developers and sound/music guy Jim Guthrie managed to have cameos. I found these traits endearing, the final polish on an already unblemished game. If you find yourself allergic to alliteration (or pretentiousness), then you might have a hard time with this one.

												Instead of trying to come up with a way to describe my experience with this game, I'll just quote a very succinct 'Rock, Paper, Shotgun' review:'Adventure game for stoners' --- 'It could come across as being embarrassed of what it is, except its more like shyness. As in, what it’s talking about is too important to be approached directly and crassly. You have to joke about it, because if you took it seriously, it’ll shatter.' --- 'And, to state the obvious, it’s certainly playing a whole bunch of games with Miyamoto’s icons.' 4 hours of tripping out!
