												Steam reports that I have only three hours in this game. Well, Steam and I are going to have to disagree on that. I own the physical collector's edition for the Xbox. I've beaten the game twice. I've bought multiple copies for friends. Alan Wake was the reason I purchased an Xbox 360 in the first place, and when it hit on PC, I bought the Digital Collector's Edition on Day one. I've sunk a lot of time into the game, and thought about it for a great deal more.I love this game.If you try to play it like the average person plays a shooter, you might not have a lot of fun. Alan Wake's not meant to be played 'normally,' it's meant to be played WELL. Shooters are games about controlling space; quite a few people have the mistaken impression that a shooter is about pointing at a thing on screen and clicking until it dies. With Alan Wake, it takes longer to click until something dies, so people get upset and think that Alan Wake is, in fact, a bad game. But that couldn't be further from the truth.At its core, Alan Wake is a strategic action game. The point is to use the beam of light to manage the distance between enemies and yourself while taking them down. Light keeps them at a distance while burning off their armor. In the most desperate fights in the game, you've got to run a healthy balance between focusing on one guy to destroy his armor and keeping the light shined on everyone else to keep them at bay so you can take down one guy at a time. This strategic play ultimately slows down the pace of the game while ratcheting up the tension. It's super clever.The story's great, by the way. You might think it's schlocky, but that's kinda the point: the game's aping the quirky, occasionally bad writing of psychological horror stories, and it does a superb job at it. Instead of trying to be great literature, Alan Wake tries to fit within its genre, and it does a fantastic job! You've got to be willing to be part of the game's peculiar quiddity, but if you do, it'll reward you.Visually and aurally, it's a stunning experience. Even if the gameplay weren't top-notch, I'd still go back to Alan Wake time and time again. Simply being there, in its world, is fascinating. Remedy crafts its moments so well that some of them are ingrained in my head. Listening to Pat Maine on the radio, shooting monsters on a stage while The Old Guards of Asgod blast away on the speakers, getting your first flares... it's great.Alan Wake is great.Seriously, buy it. Play it. Have fun!			",1159,349,32,174,142,11,204

												If you're looking for a game with a great story, dense with mystery and suspense and capable of keeping you in constant distress for hours, Alan Wake won't disappoint you. It isn't a perfect game mainly due to the somewhat repetitive action sequences, but its core is in the fantastic plot and storytelling.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a great psychological horror game with brilliant storyline. Onslaught of enemies and lack of ammunition, despair. Nice mountain scenery, pleasant radio and television stations. ""Filmness"" and climate pours out of the screen - and is still a great audio track at the end of each chapter.Feels like you are playing through a Stephen King book. The game mechanics are good and everything is so pretty! Worth recommending.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Alan Wake Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Adventure; Horror; Third-Person; Story Rich; Atmospheric My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEW”Nightmares exist outside of logic” – Stephen KingAlan Wake is an extremely enjoyable third person action-adventure/survival game with a very story-driven experience and the theme of a psychological thriller. It is a very cinematic game, with a lot of dialogue and cutscenes. So if you need constant action, you won’t find it here; but if you enjoy games that feel a lot like movies-you-control, this is a great pickup.The backbone of this game is the excellent narrative, which is well-executed and well-acted. The main story arc is mysterious, intriguing, and suspenseful.  And the voice acting is quite convincing, which is critical for a game this heavily story-driven. But my personal favorite aspect of Alan Wake is the development of the various characters. Video games sometimes have great stories, but often they lack the depth of character development one may find in other mediums of storytelling, like books, TV, or movies. The way this game was produced, though, it is easy to feel the connection with the characters and immerse yourself in their personalities.The graphics, animations, effects, and soundscape all work in concert to create an extremely engaging atmosphere that reinforces the strong narrative. The gameworld looks great and you can feel the heavy atmosphere of the creepy little village that acts as the story’s setting.  This vivid and intense setting allows the entirety of the game to be entertaining; even slow plot points remain amusing due to the immersive ambiance.  If you are into immersion, Alan Wake is definitely the kind of game you want to play with headphones on, lights off, and no interruptions.But looking past the engaging narrative and atmosphere, you will find that the actual gameplay is also pretty decent. The controls are mostly solid, albeit a little clunky— but it is the kind of clunky that is purposefully imposed to adhere to the paradigm of the scary/survival genre.   And there is an interesting dynamic involving shadows and illumination from which all action/combat is derived and that affords the game a charming uniqueness. There are also a lot of collectibles that provide further lore/backstory and add an additional dynamic to the total gameplay. Be warned however: the collectibles system can break the immersion of the game at times because you’ll have to sidetrack to find them during intense moments in the storyline.In short, Alan Wake is a great experience.  It may not appeal to those who want constant action from their games, but for those who enjoy cinematic, narrative-driven games, then this will be great to consider trying if you haven’t yet.  The dark psychological-thriller theme is easy to find intriguing and the gameplay, while not innovative, has a unique charm that is gratifying to experience.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												INTRODUCTION:Alan Wake is a survival horror third person shooter developed by Remedy Entertainment on the Xbox 360 in 2010 which slowly made its way to the PC 2 years later. It only took 48 hours for the game to surpass the development cost after their PC release.You play as (duh) Alan Wake, a writer who channels Stephen King, who, while on vacation with his wife in a sleepy mountain town, soon find themselves in the center of a supernatural phenomenon that threatens to engulf the town in darkness.PROS:+ Combat: - The combat in itself is not original since it plays like your regular Resident Evil third person shooter, however, it does spice things up by making all the enemies invulnerable until you strip away the 'darkness' that protects them using any source of light (flashlight, torch, flares etc.)+ Atmosphere: - The town and the surrounding mountains and forest are dark, mysterious, foreboding and generally hostile. Not a great place for a vacation but a great place for a survival horror action game. Great lighting is what really made the atmosphere stand out.+ Story: - (Also a CON, see below) The game boast a good story line that keeps players wondering what's going to happen next with its unique story telling mechanic. The mystery is deep and the characters within it are well written.+ Sound: - This would normally go to Atmosphere but I think it deserve its own bullet point. Voice Acting is great, sound effects are well implemented and the musical score are suited to the general theme.CONS:- Horrendous Facial Animations: - The character models are good, textures are nice, but the lip syncing and general facial animations are awkward and painful to look at.- Story: - (Also a PRO, see above) If the player has ever read a Stephen King book or seen a movie with a Stephen King book as its basis, then you can easily see where this game HEAVILY takes its inspiration. So heavy in fact that it can be seen as unoriginal.- Too Much Forest: - This is kind of a personal gripe I have with the game. It has way too much forest sequences that makes me kinda hate nature. The forest sequences are nicely done, but if repeated way to many times, it looses its charm.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. If you're looking for a third person Survival Horror experience and you're one of the disappointed Resident Evil fans, then Alan Wake is a good alternative. It delivers a clever new mechanic to the third person shooting aspect that does not involve chest high walls or massive explosions. Though the re-playability might not be great, Alan Wake still brings a lengthy adventure that makes your money's worth.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Game name: Alan Wake Game score: 10/10Reviewed by: WolfIn Summary...Alan Wake is a psychological horror survival game produced by Remedy Games in 2010. The game follows writer Alan Wake, who becomes trapped in his dreams pursued by the antagonist ""The Darkness"" who turns people basically into pawns of an evil force. Your main goal is to find and save your wife, Alice Wake, who is presumed taken by The Darkness.  The DLC, The Signal and The Writer, respectively, continue the story of Alan being trapped in his dreams, and further expands the story on how he defeats The Darkness. In The Signal DLC, you travel through memories of the past game (main story) uncovering clues to how to wake up from your dream. With Barry to accompany you, he guides you through the area with both motivation and moral support (such a good guy Barry is). In The Writer DLC, you finally uncover the truth about Barry, as well as uncover the reason your dreaming. Zane is there to guide you as like the main story, and helps you defeat The Darkness and wake up from your dream. Alan Wake is an episodic story, meaning it's told in episodes rather than all at once, kind of like how TellTale styles their games. Controls:Mouse 1 - ShootMouse - LookWASD - MoveQ - Reload flashlightE - Pick up objects/useR - Reload gunF - FocusTab - Toggle view (which side displayed in 3rd person)1,2,3,4,5 - Cycle weaponsSounds:Being a horror game, Alan Wake is filled with jump scare sounds (at least for me) such as when a Taken jumps out and attacks it's pretty sudden at times and can scare some people. Some of the cutscenes also have jumpworthy sounds when transitioning, not going to spoil where it's at because that would ruin basically the whole story. Another thing to note is the music. Each episode ending features music which in my opinion is perfect for the game. It's not disrupting in any way, and perfectly fits the atmosphere of the game. It's mostly Indie Rock, but very fitting with the game and mood, so it fits in well with everything. Graphics:So most people may not know this going into this game, but doing research will point out this game took over 5 years to develop. Being that this game was released in 2010, the graphics are still unbelieveable to this day, prividing both very scenic background areas, and also amazing cutscenes. Now, they may not be ""Unreal Engine: real life vs video game"" standards, but literally, I loved them, and got quite a few worthy of posting screenshots out of them. Game Balance:Honestly, the game was very easy. At points I did struggle (died a lot because I honestly wasn't thinking, just attacking, especially at points where I just needed to run to a Safe Haven and Taken were infinitely spawning because of it), but in the end I realized how easy the enemies were and how easy it was to progress through the levels. Albeit, I did play on normal difficulty the whole time (Nightmare I still have to do for the rest of the achievements) but I've read it's the same as normal, just less ammo, which is perfectly fine, there's way too much ammo in the game as it is. Think of Nightmare mode as hard difficulty, since they removed hard mode and there is a gap between normal and nightmare. OtherRemedy, ♥♥♥♥ Microsoft and find a new producer/publisher. They aren't biting and your fans NEED Alan Wake 2. Final Rating:10/10In Conclusion:Alan Wake is by far to date the best experience I've had in a game. It's inspired a lot of creativity out of me, one of which are a few ideas for short stories and also has provided me with a perfect story in game form. I loved literally every second of this game, and I very very very highly recommend it to all of my friends and anyone who reads this. -It's not a lake, it's an ocean.Please feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations. Thanks for reading!			",382,112,18,35,48,7,18

												A succesful writer, Alan Wake, decides to go to Bright Falls to get inspiration for his next book. He hasn't managed to get a word on paper for almost 2 years. The idea however wasn't for Alan to actually write there, he needed some time off.When his wife Alice tell him she has a suprise for him, he gets excited. The suprise however did not turn out to be a good one, Alice showed him a typewriter, Alan gets furious, and goes outside to cool down. When he looks up, he sees the lights switch off in the study where he and Alice where just moments ago, followed by a terrifying scream. A second goes by, and all of the sudden he sees something drag Alice from the balcony into the water. He doesn't think, and jumps in the water. He wakes up in his car, for after what seems just to be a moment later. The citizens of Bright Falls that have gone missing over the years try to kill him, but they're not just regular citizens. Something dark and evil has taken possesion of them, making them almost unable to be killed. The dark smoke that surrounds them protects them from everything vulnerable to them, except for one crucial thing. Light. Lucky for Alan, he owns a flashlight, and he isn't afraid to use it. He finds a revolver, and manages to find a way to kill these dark inhabitans of Bright Falls. In his journeys he comes across so called 'manuscriptpages', pages from a book he apparently wrote... This is just the beginning of the great game called; Alan Wake. It's storyline is so good and at the same time so terrifying, you might actually fall off your chair when playing this game. The many characters you come across in your travels through Bright Falls shows that the creators really did their best when the made this game. I find this story suitable for an actual book, my favorite writer Stephen King would approve this. The money you pay for this game might even be not enough, this game will suck you up just like a good book does. You get so involved with the characters and environment that you need to pinch your arm ones or twice before you go back to the real world. This game is defenitly a must-play.

												As a writer and a gamer, I can recommend Alan Wake as the crème de la crème of both worlds. The story's quality is that of a blockbuster movie narrated by Alan Wake himself, divided into several chapters. Gameplay-wise this game plays with light like few other horror games do. Revolvers and shotguns sure are handy, but your best friend and best weapon in this game is any lightsource you can find. The Taken are surrounded by a shield of darkness that deflects bullets, and only a concentrated beam of light can break their defenses. Focus your flashlight's lightcone on your enemies and finish them off with a couple of shots to see them explode and burst into little sparks. It may not offer tons of replayability, apart from collecting all the collectables and achievements, but it's a thrilling ride any lover of great storytelling should go through at least once.

												The story in Alan Wake is quite exceptional comparing to other video games in the genre. Too bad the rest of the game can't match up to the well-written storytelling. The game kicks off interestingly where we meet our protagonist, who is struggling with writing crisis and a ""little bit"" of insanity. Soon we find ourselves fighting with shadowy creatures named 'The Taken' controlled by a mysterious force.The fighting mechanics based on the power of light are unique. While this newish fighting scheme is fun at first it lacks deepness, so it becomes repetitive. Unfortunately nothing good can be said about the controls, which is one of the most discouraging features of the game: awkward movements, slow reaction times, super sensitive mouse controlsOne of the high points of the game is the voice acting. It phenomenally supports the great story, which pushes the player for resolution...that may or may not exists in the end. The end of the story will leave many with questions and bad taste, but the open nature of the conclusion is not necessarily a bad thing at all. However, the special chapters (The Signal and The Writer) will help put a proper end to this tale.After 6 chapters it is hard to think of any reasons why anyone, who is not a fan of Alan would start this game all over again. The replay value of the game is very low thanks to its linear nature. Other than some collectibles there's no point to return. Alan Wake is one of those games that would've been enjoyable on a big screen rather than with a controller in a hand.Rating: 65/100; Replay Value: 1/5; To Beat: 14-16 hours (incl. the specials); Played on: normal.

												Let's get one thing out of the way: If you're a creative type, especially a writer of any persuasion, Alan Wake is worth a playthrough just for the subject matter, namely the nature of dreams, the unconscious, and the creative process, and how they are all tied up in each other. Any professional fiction writer will tell you that they often don't know where their ""ideas"" come from -- they might as well just come straight out of the proverbial ether, and to anyone else it sounds like superstitious mumbo-jumbo. But the truth is, it often really does come out of left field, left field being that ocean of subconscious impulses and images that is constantly roiling in everyone's heads. A writer's job is paying attention to those images when they do show up, when most people can comfortably ignore them, and that makes it a tricky business. That's the gist of what Alan Wake deals with, and if anything, it's worth it to see what the game devs have to say about it.Is it a GOOD story? Well. That is entirely up to your interpretation of the events in the game. And I'll mostly leave it at that. I'll give some of my impressions in no particular order: If you like the show LOST, you'll like this. If you like David Lynch's stuff, you will like this, particularly for some of the music and very obvious homages to things like Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet and perhaps Lost Highway. That is to say, if you want things to make sense in a linear way, forget it. It's actually a little bittersweet to play through this if you are a big fan of Lynch, because while Alan Wake is very very obviously a love letter to the ""weird stuff happening in a little town"" genre, and it really does nail some of the spooky imagery that Lynch is known for, the characters and the dialogue fall disappointingly flat. It's a very rough imitation of the unforgettable dialogue of Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, etc. I can't fault them that much for that, because at least they tried. Enough of that.Gameplay is pretty technically tight with satisfying, challenging gunplay mixed up with light-source mechanics -- you weaken things with your flashlight, and then blast them. It's fun and keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time. But, and this just may be my low tolerance for the same damn thing over and over, there are many times later in the game where you wish you could just get it over with. The pacing is a little annoying and predictable at times; when you would appreciate a chance to just wander around in the more story-oriented areas, suddenly you're back in the gauntlet of enemies running through the nighttime forest. And there is a LOT of nighttime forest. You've never seen so many trees! But they certainly look pretty. One of my biggest gripes would have to be the fact that the game occasionally does not follow its own rules, which inevitably leads to some frustrating reloads. The enemies will sometimes cheap-shot you, for example falling on you while you're in the middle of opening a chest; most of the time you cannot break out of certain ""cinematic"" moments fast enough and it will screw you fairly mercilessly. Thankfully reload times are fast and the checkpoints for the most part are plentiful and logical. Just minor annoyances when it comes down to it.It's a fun ride for the most part. I wish I could say that ""this is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee,"" but for several reasons it's just a pretty good cup of joe. You take what you can get, though!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake presents a really interesting way of conveying a compelling narrative, coupled with tense, tight gameplay and excellent lighting effects. The drawbacks I found were it is not a scary game as was expected, the gameplay can become repetitive if played in longer sessions and the visual quality of the cutscenes can be lacking at times, but the atmosphere more than makes up for these shortcomings. Overall a very interesting and unorthodox method of gaming presentation, highly recommended.			",190,17,7,15,6,0,11

Alan Wake definitely won a place in my top 10 games of all time.And also, if you like watching Twin Peaks then you will love this game.

												Alan Wake is an episodic psychological-thriller action game that follows the titular author on his 'vacation' to the fictional Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls. Alan has fallen on hard times, after writing his very successful Alex Casey crime-drama series, he hasn't been able to write another book for the last two years, and has become far more well-known for his violent out-lashes at the press. He and his wife, Alice, are hoping to get away from it all, away from the bustling city of New York that they're accustomed too to the small and peaceful Washington town ... However, this goes terribly wrong after a series of odd occurrences at their resting cabin ends up with Alan waking up a week later with no memory of what happened in the last week, his wife missing, and strange shadow people coming after him in the darkness of the woods.Alan Wake at its best is an immersive trip both into the rather colorful and well-realized town of Bright Falls, and the more sinister and campy lurkings that pull from everything from Stephen King to Lovecraft to David Lynch. At its worst its a repetitive combat game where you'll often get lost in the woods.Maybe more appropriately stated is that Alan Wake is a huge love it/hate it game. There are elements of Alan Wake that it pulls off beautifully, while other elements wear rather thin over its course. Honestly how much you enjoy the game deals completely in how grand you enjoy what it does right, and how much you can deal with what it does wrong.Alan Wake is a rather gorgeous game. It has fantastic art direction, a well-done lighting system, matched with fantastic optimization for PC and probably some of the best realized forest settings and night lighting realized in games. Its visual flair suffers a bit from some weird facial animations from the characters, but during sections of the game where you stand on mountains overlooking a valley below full of details, it can be kind of breath-taking. Bright Falls feels like a real-place, and the way they connect everything and how it all fits together as an overall map is impressive. It does feel like a vibrant, lived-in place often during the daytime sections of gameplay where you get to explore and take everything in.It also has a very elegant soundtrack to it. The compositions really switch between three tones; beautiful symphonic pieces for the more relaxing and emotional scenes of the game, low-keyed and sometimes a bit sinister down-time music to match exploration and dreary environments, and rather thunderous 'struggle' music of when the action gets going. From this, the beautiful symphonic pieces definitely stand-out, but none of it is really bad. On-top of this, a variety of licensed songs have been chosen for the game, which play on radios and during episode endings. And sound-design is rather top-notch, with atmospheric forestry sounds, creaks in rustic homes, and little sounds that really help make the atmosphere and world. The sounds of shining light on enemies, shooting your gun, and your flashlight turning on, are all also suitably satisfying.The gameplay of Alan Wake is really split into two modes; Exploration mode, where you're in a location without enemies with a variety of small tasks you can do, both for progression and for fun, and Night Time, when often you're isolated and alone (or with someone who you question how long they're going to last) as monsters come out at you from the woods. The night time takes up probably about 80% of the game, while exploration mode happens about 20% of the time.The combat system is fairly simple, though with a few tricks to it. Enemies are covered in shadows which make them invincible to bullets, so the first goal is to disperse the shadows with your light. You can focus-down a strong beam of light that will chip more at the shadows of an enemy, but rapidly consumes battery power, or do a normal light, which does a lot less damage to Taken but slowly recharges the battery. If you use up a battery, it will go out and be off for about 10 seconds, unless you put in a new battery, but of which come in limited supplies. You can also use light to also stun enemies by flashing them with a strong beam quickly, which is useful if you decide to flee rather than fight. The guns feel rather samey, but you also get flashbang grenades, which will kill in one-hit weaker enemies and damage stronger ones, and flares, which you can light to ward-off enemies or deplete at their shadows.Alan's final form of dealing with Taken is to flee from encounters, but this can be a bit tricky at first. Alan has very limited sprinting (he'll tire out after about 15 seconds and lower his pace to a light jog), and the enemies can catch-up to you without some intervention. The real art of fleeing in Alan Wake isn't just running, but to manage your stamina meter (it's better to stop before you tire-out to recharge it than letting it run out), and managing the enemies with your light by briefly flashing a strong light on them to stun them for a few moments.All-in-all, it can be satisfying, but as the game goes on it can also be fairly repetitive. There's only about seven types of enemies through the course of the game, and three of them are rather similar. The limited selection and the amount of times you face the enemies can be a bit tiring.Also a good portion of the game is set in forests., especially early on. The game throws you into a lot of forests where if you're not good at keeping direction in mind or marking landmarks, it can get very easy to get lost.But there is some good mix-up here. A variety of set-pieces and moments lay littered through the adventure to help break the tedium of combat, ranging from atmospheric and moody caverns, stage show showdowns, a variety of exploration and daytime sections, police chases, car driving segments, and more. In some parts of the game you won't be fighting alone, and notably during Episodes 4 and 5 especially, they tread you away from the forests to much more interesting locations.Alan Wake may test on some gamers patience, but there is also a lot to love here. The characters are colorful, and through the game's course are very easy to like. Optional side-stuff, including interesting radio broadcasts and black-and-white Twilight Zone parodies you can watch on televisions through the world are enjoyable.There are a total of 8 episodes in Alan Wake, and to beat them all should take you somewhere between 12-24 hours. The breaking point for many comes during Episode 3, which is notably the longest episode in the whole game, and with less story developments than most of the other episodes as well.On a personal level, I really enjoyed Alan Wake. It has flaws, the biggest one being repetition, but the overall package I found to be immersive, to have enjoyable TV-show like gameplay segments (fun characters, cliffhangers, location design), and I got rather wrapped up in the story and world of the game. There's stand-out moments in gameplay, and I can honestly say there is no other game quite like Alan Wake. While it pulls from a lot of sources, it manages to be unlike any other game, and quite unique.But there is drudgery here, and if you're less a fan of camp, world-building, and more dragged down by repetition of combat, you may very well not enjoy your trip to Bright Falls. To some, the game comes off as a mediocre game with flashes of brilliance that it unfortunately does not ever quite live up too.Alan Wake will either strike with you or will not, a rather polarizing game. However, if you're a fan of horror authors, television programs like Twin Peaks or Happy Town, or want a believable Pacific Northwest setting, this may do you in.			",2637,1273,70,245,264,20,257

finally finished ALAN WAKEPros:+great and compelling plot+the idea of using a flashlight to weaken the enemies' bullet immunity defense and then killing them is pretty neat+the night Springs episodes were pretty cool and awesomely twisted and creepy+great and realistic voice acting+nice graphics+realistic facial animations+the story notes which tell you of what is about to happen next were pretty cool and sounded magicalThose seven are the only good things I saw in the game, now for the flaws:-cliche, generic, and one dimensional characters-a very horrible, dislikable and crappy main character-extremely repetitive gameplay, you must just go from area to area to survive the attacks of the taken of that area, and then proceed to the next area to do the same thing-very very few and pathetically designed puzzles-only 3 enemy types, and they're not really all that different, both design-wise and gameplay-wise-no actual real boss fights-pathetic exploration and easy to find items (story notes, coffees, and TVs that air night Springs)And those 7 are the things I disliked and found frustrating in alan wake. So far you can guess that a game that has the same amount of pros and cons is most definitely not above 8 and is technically mediocre, but I have my own criteria, the most important things in a game for me are gameplay in first place, and story and characters in second place, music, graphics, and voice acting don't have much place in my criteria, and since most of the pros are actually the graphics and voice acting, and 5 of the flaws are about the gameplay, I would ultimately rate the game a:6 out of 10. It was a mediocre game, don't see what's so great and hyping about the game, the plot was good and all, but it really wasn't anything particulary unique or incredible, it was just simply good, nothing more, nothing less, and I already explained how repetitive, monotonous, and simple the gameplay is, the gameplay is the game's weakest point.

												Another good Remedy game, fits along side their previous good games of Death Rally - Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne.Not only was the game play fun with quite interesting mechanics of Light VS. Dark, the story line got me interested to the very end.And the end of the story is where the entire presentation falters.Slight cliffhanger, no solid end.According to numerous websites, there were plans on an Alan Wake sequel, but that didn't due to 'not enough sales' says Mr. Microsoft Games. Which is a pity.  Otherwise, a good ride till the sudden stop.A good buy indeed. ",392,82,21,39,10,7,29

While you do that, you have to find the pieces of the bombom's wrapper (manuscript pages), these pieces promise you that you will find a delicious filling (story) if you eat all the candy, well that's indeed true, its delicious, you are tired of the chocolate, but this filling, wow, you want some more......but suddenly you discover that the candy factory have no plans to make more bomboms in the future, and here we are 5 years later... and still waiting.

												One of the best games of Remedy Entertainment.The gfx, atmosphere and light effects are spectacular, considering it's a game released in 2012.The story is definitely interesting and keep moving on without becoming boring a single minute.Very good voice acting and some jump scares.The only negative comment is about the gameplay getting a bit repetitive / no sense of progression - but this is abolutely not a reason to avoid this game. Some parts of the game are challenging.If you are looking for an immersive story and great atmosphere, don't think twice and go for it!			",296,144,5,69,6,1,42

												Alan Wake is a psychothriller game based on supernatural powers. It shows how powerful darkness really is. The game is set in a rural town called Bright Falls in Washington state, USA. Alan Wake is a professional writer from New York City who decides to go on a vacation in a small town. However, his vacation turns into a nightmare as he is attacked by possessed beings known as the Taken. Wake’s wife is apparently kidnapped from their cabin located in a nearby lake, encouraging Wake to look for her in the wilderness. The game is spread across six episodes that feel like a TV show.As Alan Wake looks for his wife, manuscript pages are scattered in each episode. The manuscript pages flesh out the story of the suspense Mr. Wake is going through, although he does not remember writing it. There are many strange plot twists such as crazy things happening shortly after reading about them in his manuscript pages. Wake is a disturbed man and this sets up effective storytelling.The gameplay is mainly in the night when darkness rears its ugly head. There are a few daytime scenes, but it is best that there no more daytime scenes. Otherwise, too many daytime scenes would have taken away the moody feel of the game. There are many scary encounters with the Taken, who are armed with knives and other projectiles ready to kill Wake. You can evade these possessed humans by running from their attacks, creating a cool cinematic dodge. Every time you enter a new store or turn a corner you feel anxious about who or what will come after you. The Taken are vulnerable to light, so that is when your flashlight, flares, and flashbang grenades come into play.Aiming at the Taken is required, but shooting at them without aiming a flashlight at them to remove their strength of darkness is a waste of valuable ammo. As soon as you take away their darkness, you can shoot them with your conventional weapons like a revolver, shotgun, or hunting rifle. Ammo is not very plentiful, so it is important to use your ammo wisely. You can choose to run away from them so that you can reach the next safe haven, a place where strong light is projected onto the ground. The Taken do not dare enter the light for fear that they will be killed.When the Taken are not attacking you there are possessed objects such as barrels, cranes, bulldozers, etc. These possessed objects seem to be from the famous movie Poltergeist. You must use Wake’s flashlight or flares to disintegrate possessed objects, as they are vulnerable to light and cannot be shot. I found it quite scary to see a bulldozer suddenly turn on and chase me while no one was inside driving and a few Taken were attacking. This is when your battle skills are tested to see how good you are with your flashlight, flares, and flashbang grenades. Your flashlight loses battery power and must be recharged. The limited battery power adds to the suspense of having to insert a new battery while the Taken and/or possessed objects are threatening to kill you. It is also quite unsettling when flocks of ravens suddenly descend upon you from the sky and the only way to eliminate them is by using light sources. The only problem I have with the combat with the Taken is that it may feel a little repetitive when heading toward the end of the story in episode 6.The graphics of Alan Wake are still neat on the PC. Bright Falls looks gorgeous in the day during rare daytime scenes. The night looks detailed enough when looking at an abandoned farm that looks decrepit. The graphics make this small town look authentically rural. I found a few graphical glitches in some indoor settings, but they are rare and superficial.After completing the main story, you can choose to play the DLCs, including The Signal and The Writer. The DLCs are definitely worth playing since they expand on the main story. The Signal and The Writer both feel even creepier and more bizarre than the main story. It was particularly scary when suddenly, not one, but two monster trucks were chasing me in The Signal DLC with no one inside either monster truck.I highly recommend Alan Wake for its well written horror story that translates into spooky atmosphere for the gameplay. It is a creepy game that does not let up and keeps the combat tight and intense until the very end for the main game as well as for the DLCs. I firmly believe that the DLCs, although short, are worth playing and retain the creepy atmosphere.My Score: 8.5/10			",190,18,0,4,7,2,6

												What can be said about the game Alan Wake, for starters it's pretty amazing....  I would highly recommend if you don't own the game you should stop reading and immediately go pick it up..  Need a little more convincing where here goes..You find yourself playing the mysterious and successful author Alan Wake.  Finding himself with a major case of writers block, Alan and his wife Alice decide to take a trip to Bright Falls, hoping the distraction of a 2 week vacation in a beautiful setting will help shake out of the cobwebs.  What could go wrong, a beautiful woman, a beautiful scenic cabin and  2 weeks of silence.. The game was originally supposed to be an open world game, and what a game it would have been.  Unfortunately while the open world portion of the game was cut, the parts that remain are fairly large although kind of straight forward.  Yet exploration by the player is rewarded with additional supplies or collectibles..   The combat....  it's unique and interesting, although can be a bit repetitive as only a few different enemy types exist in the game..  The major way this game excels where other 3rd person horror games have failed is with dodging... and trust me you'll be doing alot of dodging..  Outside of that it's fairly straight forward, point your flashlight at enemy, break the darkness shield and then fire away with one of your weapons (Handgun, Shotgun, Flare gun,) it's easier than it sounds although at higher difficulty levels the limited supplies will more than likely see you running to the next check point..If you're a fan of horror games, mystery movies,  3rd person games or just games in general you will probably like Alan Wake, the only real downside of this game would have to be the lack of enemy diversity.  Although the story more than makes up for the short comings of the enemy diversity.			",3681,1533,148,419,522,48,546

												I expected a random TPS, with some monsters and a classic story. I found a gem.+ The story is awesome, I won't spoil, I'll just leave a quote:Stephen King once wrote that “Nightmares exist outside of logic, and there’s little fun to be had in explanations; they’re antithetical to the poetry of fear.” In a horror story, the victim keeps asking ""Why?"" But there can be no explanation, and there shouldn’t be one. The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest, and it’s what we’ll remember in the end. My name is Alan Wake. I’m a writer.+ Graphics: It's a 2010 game, ported to windows in 2012, but it still looks awesome. Charming locations (SweetFX is really recommended, the game is so ""yellow"", with sfx \ without sfx[i.imgur.com])+ Sound: Great soundtrack, amazing acting\voices\effects+ Gameplay: It's perfect for the game: you are alone with a torch and a gun, you need to stay sharp, around you there's nothing but the darkness, shadows and poltergeister. You are not a commando, sometimes you have to run. A lot of encounters are amazing but it's a bit repetitive.- The camera is a bit awkward- Remedy is working on Quantum Break, no sequel :C			",692,218,20,57,55,9,64

												Alan Wake is a combination of survival horror and psychological thriller. It looks, plays, and feels a lot like an episode of Twilight Zone, from which the game overtly draws a lot of inspiration. Alan Wake is *not* an action game, but there are combat sequences which feel forced, repetitive, and unnecessary. The Good:* Interesting and compelling story, although it is cliche at times. I get the light/dark motif and its importance to the theme - but it is as old as sin and you don't need to cram it down my throat!* The game runs great on PC; it is hard to tell this is a console port. I originally played the game on console and I think I now prefer it on PC.* Fantastic graphics and atmosphere. The town of Bright Falls feels like a real town in its own fictional universe with its own radio stations, TV programs, and billboard advertisements.* The game is frequently only $3-$5 (up to 90% off!) during Steam sales, which is one of the best deals I have seen for a AAA title on Steam.The Bad:* The player is asked to press F5 quite often to read manuscript pages. However, once done reading the manuscript, the player is given the option to (a) cancel, or (b) return. These two options are fairly ambiguous, and I more than once chose the ""cancel"" option, which required me to navigate through several menus to actually get back to the game.* Uninteresting ""collectibles"" mechanic - why am I supposed to collect these coffee thermoses if I have no idea what they do or how to keep track of them? Why is someone hiding them in horrible places, such as behind this large sign that happens to have an invisible wall next to it?* The combat is unique but completely uncomepelling: you must first shine a flashlight on an an enemy for perhaps 3-4 seconds before your bullets will do any damage. In practice, this mechanic is the least-interesting portion of the game. I ended up dreading combat sequences as they distracted from the game's only strong-suit: the plot.* Inconsistent ammo/resource management feature. At times I was constantly at maximum capacity, and at other times I was avoiding entire mobs of enemies to conserve ammo. If I was ever low on ammo, I could always spend 5-10 minutes backtracking to pick up ammo that I left earlier due to being at maximum capacity the first time around. This is entirely flawed game design: either give the player a larger capacity for ammo, or don't give them the ability to go back and pick up ammo they missed. Making the player go backwards at a snail's pace is NOT a feature.* Awkward controls limit Alan's mobility. Why can I jump over some knee-high ledges, but not small logs that are about ankle-high?* The ""extra episodes"" are horrible. My first death occurred because I walked into some floating text a few times....The Ugly:* Horrible check point system. There are no save games, just checkpoints. If you barely survive an enemy encounter with only 1 bullet left and happen to end up at a check point, that's it, there's no retrying that fight to see if you can land a better outcome. That one bullet is all you have now, and you now have to either start the entire game over or try running through the rest of the chapter without fighting any enemies (which is virtually impossible if there are more than 2-3 enemies at once.)* Outside of the fantastic plot, the game, at its core concept, is a hallway with uninteresting obstacles in the way. By the end of chapter 2, you will begin to ask yourself how many more repetitive trails in the middle of the woods you will have to travel to reach the end of the story (spoiler: a lot more).* Even though I have touched on the plot being fantastic so much, there are some huge plotholes. If the monsters are afraid of light, why didn't Alan buy a much bigger flashlight before he went venturing around at midnight? If a non-monster person wanted to meet Alan, why did he set the rendevous time to be at night when the monsters are out and he knows it is unsafe? There are also MANY more plotholes that would be spoilers if I typed them here. Also, as in the Bioshock games, if you don't collect all the manuscript pages (which are often somewhat hidden), you are liable to miss entire sections of the plot.The Verdict:Alan Wake might be worth it to check out the story for three or four dollars. Personally, I felt the replay value and broken mechanics were so bad that I could not bring myself to play it through a second time while writing this review. Pick this up only if you are looking for a good story with depth and don't mind repetitive action sequences.			",224,72,4,40,33,2,60

												A Stephen King like novel of a game! You as the player Alan Wake, don't know if you are living in a nightmare and all that around you is a bad dream or you are wide awake and dealing with reality in the surroundings around you. It's fun and spooky mystery! You will feel on edge most of the game. Good misxture of storytelling, and action sequnces so you never get bored. The soundtrack is also a must listen and really sets the mood and atmosophere for this game. The graphics, lighting and world textures are absolutely stunning! Voice acting is also top notch and does not feel cheesy in any way. I would put Alan Wake game it right up there with some of the most memorable horror video games of all time such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's been a while since i finished the game.Frankly I didn't think a writer with a gun and a flashlight would be any fun but i was wrong.The game graphic is great story like detail and perfectly composed music that fits this game.The control is quite sensitive and it's fun to do cinematic dodges and counter. It's a horror game but I laughed more in this game and never got scared.Collection and achievements are pretty easy to get and there are really nothing super hard to find.The story is quite confusing at first but once you progress further it start to make sense more and more.The 2 extra story included is very fun to play but even for a FPS vetern like me i got motion sickness when i got stuck in the wheel for too long. I didn't write this review when I first finished it because this game was so good that made me play the sequel right after.That sequel is a huge disappointment. So this game is 8.5/10. Get this one. play and enjoy it but do not get the sequel. ",2441,943,81,289,309,25,343

Read the full review here[sexyitalianguy.wordpress.com]It doesn't fit this frameAlan Wake is one of those games that you love or hate, there is no halfway. It has a solid gameplay that will keep us playing not less than eight hours at normal difficulty, and while the replayability is low, there are many secret chests to find, and many moments where we can cross the arms and watch a TV show or listen a radio broadcasting that suits the game and, more or less, tells us another side of the story we’re going through. The soundtrack fits the ambient and contributes to create a creep in the player’s mind, while the narrator sums up the situation or tells us about Alan’s feelings and thoughts between the fights. Graphic: 8Sounds: 8Longevity: 7Gameplay: 8Final Score: 8/10Buy it if you like third person shooters and action adventures, even if you aren’t a lover of the horror games.			",493,133,26,43,32,5,51

												I don't scare easily and while Alan Wake didn't scare me outright, it provided a constant state of creepiness that was continuously chilling. The characters and story along with the storytelling are awesome. The graphics, photography, and camera work are stunning. The one major blemish is the gameplay which isn't all that bad, it just isn't all that good either. However using a flashlight to fight off the darkness is a pretty cool concept and the execution comes off pretty nicely. Although I have to admit the game didn't draw me in to play non-stop from start to finish--ultimately starting the game in September and not actually finishing it until November.So what is it about Alan Wake that makes it so standoffish? Well for starters, the gameplay starts to get repetitiously dull. Some of the forest paths are really long laying ground for more hordes of Taken than one person can deal with before it just becomes mundane. It is kind of broken up with some areas to explore in between, but it wasn't enough. The other aspect which may sound weird is that I never really felt like I took the role as Alan Wake. Instead it felt more like I was just moving the story forward and watching Alan unfold as opposed to being a part of critical decisions. Fortunately the chapters are broken up very nicely into roughly two hour segments with good musical intermissions allowing players whatever amount of time they need before jumping into the next chapter.Overall, a fantastic game and a must play in my book.

												Bonjour,I bought Alan Wake on Steam but a few playtime is on record cuz' I've already mastered this game on xb1 and got full achievements. This game was a strong nominee for Game of The Year 2012 and I never put any doubt on this, since this game is one of a kind: catching story telling, wonderfull atomosphere building and I got totally floored by the Dev.'s imagination. My name's Alan Wake. ""It's not a lake. It's an ocean."" It's time for departure. It's time to return. The base game is awesome and the DLCs are even better. The whole game is a poetry with dilusion, uncertainty and depression. Are you looking for someone? Or are you just looking for yourself? A pistole and a flashlight. Darkness and light.  ""Alan, wake !"" The two single words mark the plot of game: you are a writer named Alan who lost his muse for a long time and one day, you realized that you are in a dream. Night is dark and full of terror, but waking up is not an option and god, the inspiration tastes so good. Step into the darkness and you will fall for it. Close your eyes and you are in a world of fiction and perfection. Also I gotta say this game is extremely romantique. Alan Wake, a writer who can bearly hold a gun, has to endure horrible nights and fight shadows, all in searching for his wife. When he finally found out the truely, he chose to sit in the small attic writing till the end of the story. ""It's not a lake. It's an ocean.""Last words of the game. Swallowed by darkness. The pros:+The pressure is real. Can't even breath some times. +Must-get DLCsThe cons:-Where's Alan Wake 2 ? -Could this be real ? -Now I hate Televisions. 10/10 One of my all-time favorites.

												TL;DR: Alan Wake is a well-constructed and interesting game, with great atmospheric environments that work well with an interesting combat mechanic. With this is a clever story line and charming but somewhat poorly animated characters; this game is great for anyone looking for a solid thriller game.In Alan wake there is a dark and twisted world where light and dark are prominent in both environment and tone. The graphics still hold up today and work beautifully with the lighting mechanics to build an intense experience. The atmosphere in Alan Wake is excellent; walking through dark woods in the night with your flashlight and weapon is rather creepy and with the light based combat mechanic manages to scare and reward. While at times the environment may seem repetitive the game does break up its action with puzzle sections and slightly dodgy driving segments.Positive features:-Fantastic atmosphere-Different combat mechanic with array of weapons-Beautiful graphics and lighting-A well put together story line-DLC comes includedNegative features:-Occasionally repetitive areas-Cut scenes are dated with poor character models and lip syncing-Sudden physics related glitches on more than one occasionTo conclude Alan Wake is a solid all-round game; while not perfect and debatable in terms of its ""horror"" tag the whole experience is one that is well worth your time with replay ability for completionsists and DLC that adds to the game and story.

												A deep, psychological thriller with an excellent Stephen King feel to it. This game failed to disappoint me and kept me wanting more and interested until the very end. From it's great storyline to stunning graphics to excellent gameplay, as well as all of these together with the dark, but crazy atmosphere, it's a game I had a lot of enjoyment with and would be more than glad to play again.The game unfolded like a movie, which for this particular game, I thought it suited nicely. And although I'm not a huge fan of the episodic/chapter format of video games in general, with this game, it didn't bother me too much as I believed other aspects of the game definitely overshadowed that for me. And then there's the music/sound of the game, which turned out to be strong as well for this game. I found it to really add to the mood and atmosphere of the game. With is important to me as I believe atmosphere to be an important part of a game, at least to me. They helped to immerse myself in the game even further.In my opinion, Alan Wake is a must-play and unforgettable experience. It's a game that's an excellent piece of work that I'd be more than willing to play again. Can't wait for the sequel, whenever that will be.			",88,14,1,3,3,0,2

												I've beaten this game and the DLC multiple times before despite my hours as of (Nov 18th, 2014) saying otherwise. This game has one of the best storylines I've ever played in a game. It is a true ""Mind ♥♥♥♥"" to say the least and will keep you entertained from start to finish. The games graphics are still good when compared to next gen graphics and the game itself can be quite challenging at times. The gameplay is a bit clunky at times but is good enough.Graphics: At the time of release: 10/10, Currently: 8.5/10Story line: 9.5/10Gameplay: 8/10Game length: 11-15 hoursOverall: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

GameplayMost of the levels you explore have victims of the darkness that will stop you at any cost. Your best friend is the light. You will find yourself using your flashlight almost always. Of course, you have additional firearms if your flashlight runs low on battery or if you are getting hoarded by the dark monstrosities. There are boss battles, of course, with harder showdowns which could be a challenge.StoryI can't even describe it very good, the story is a prime. You are Alan Wake who is a famous writer who has written books about the evil that lurks in the darkness. You and your wife were going on a vacation in Bright Falls when suddenly she was drowned by an unknown entity. The main plot is, that everything Alan writes in his books will soon come to life, drawing him near insanity at some points. (It was about a year ago when I played this game, so I have mixed somethings here)AtmosphereAnother shining part of this game is its chilling and dark forests. These are commonly taken of by the darkness which haunts you. When you see a light source, oh man, it's relief at its best.PerformanceI had to lower the settings on a medium-rig PC to low-medium graphics quality. As so, be warned if you are skeptic about your specs.LongevityThe story lasted 9 hours for me, which is a good length. Even so, it felt really long and enjoyable. Not much replay-ability, except for the fact that there are collectibles which might have slipped under your nose.SummaryAlan Wake is an extra-ordinary game. Featuring atmosphere that is far from bad and a well-written story, I give it9 flashlights out of 10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Introduction Alan Wake could be the perfect example of a psychological thriller where the main protagonist meets the arts of writing and gets traped in a story (much more like a nightmare). Everything works with this game from point A to point B. It gets you hooked from the start into the story, creating questions that you need to seek the answer by embarking onto this incredible realised narative. The Story ''Alan Wake'' as the title says, suggests the center of the game, which is also the protagonist and by ''center'', yes he is the key to all of it. I haven't found any plot-holes at all and the story seemd so satisfying to go through, which made me curious about every detail of it, indeed it could work aswell as a TV show, a great one to be honest, and I'm really happy that Remedy had the great idea to encapsulate it all as a TV show, every chapter as an episode and at the very first of every the chapter, a rewind from the previous chapter. There are a variety of characters which are also very well written and you can easliy get attached to any of it. The main villain is none but the darkness following your every step you do in the beautiful realised mountain landscape with huge forests that makes you feel very lost. The game is linear but it doesn't feel like that at all, it didn't bugged me off and I think it won't do it to you. The Gameplay It's incredible simple and all you have to do is to weakean the darkness by pointing a flashlight towards it and then shoot ! Sounds fun right ? It sure did for me at first, but it can get repetitive overtime if you play on the easiest difficult. The game is not a difficult one, but you have to preserve some of batteries and bullets if you want to survive, so my tip is to not waste them and collect everything that game offers you, in fact the gameplay is all about surviving. How does it feels ? The experience isn't as horror if you are into horror games, although it is scarry for a new comer to this genre and it really feels like you are always followed, combined with the uncertainity it gets you to feel like you are trapped.It looks pretty good, the setting looks amazing, and it's really well optimized, this showing that developers cared about almost everything that ''Alan Wake'' meant. Overall I cannot but to recommend to you this game as it has a brilliant story, great protagonist, great atmosphere and all feels really polished and well done. I loved this game at it's time and even right now it's an incredible game. Playing this pays off, at the end it feels like a rewarding experince and I really needed to tell you this. I enjoyed every minute of it's atmosphere and I hope you will too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a linear third-person shooter whose atmosphere and story attempt to redeem the frankly clunky combat. The game proceeds in six episodes (with two additional DLC episodes that are now included for free). Worth a purchase on sale if you enjoy a combat-driven interactive movie, but there's not much replayability (unless you're a collectibles and achievements fanatic). You can view the opening of the game here.Installed size on hard drive (all DLC and extras): 11.2 GB Alan's wife, Alice, gets “taken” by a mysterious “dark presence.” The entire game is spent trying to release her from its power. Alan is frequently lost, operating on whim, and not really sure of how to proceed. A writer himself, he begins researching old legends of Cauldron Lake and the power that words written there seem to possess. This is really the best part of the game, as the labyrinth of creation and created and how to balance what is desired with what is needed leads Alan down an increasingly dark path (pun intended). As he discovers, he is not alone in his knowledge of the lake's mysterious power, nor the first to suffer from it. The supporting cast are varied and colorful characters, several of whom have their own history with Cauldron Lake. The atmosphere is suitably dark and fog-swept at times. Most of the game happens at night, so turn down your room lights and crank the audio to catch the ambiance (the sound design is superb). The setting is a unique one: the woods and small town atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest. The ambiance is captured nicely, and the woods have thick foliage and dark shadows. Old logging and mining gear abounds, providing just the right touch of historical nostalgia and rusty menace. The buildings and architecture are a mix of rustic, country-style structures (built sturdy to withstand the harsh winters) other more attractive, modern structures designed to impress tourists (Cauldron Lake Lodge). The superb music score is the icing on the atmospheric cake: moody but melodic, it catches the feeling of solitude at night-time haunted by the supernatural. A supernatural that is made perhaps more terrifying by the clunky combat. Shine a light at enemies to burn away the darkness, then shoot them with whatever weapon you have to hand. It works well enough, but feels loose and sloppy. The weapons are few, but do feel different: revolver, shotgun (regular and pump-action), flare gun, hunting rifle, flares, and flash-bangs. That's it. They're not all available at the same time, and at the beginning of each episode, Alan only has a flashlight and a revolver. So, no matter how good you were with saving up your gear, thinking there might be a big battle coming up, once the episode ends, you'll lose it all anyway. The enemies offer little variety. You've got the standard hatchet-throwing “taken”, the big “taken”, the fast “taken”, and random flocks of crows that fly out of the sky and attack Alan. Sometimes random objects (like cars, tires, dumpsters) will become possessed and attack Alan. With so many creatures that dwell in the woods of the Pacific Northwest, I expected there might be a boss fight with a bear or a pack of coyotes, but no.None of these drawbacks would matter if the total experience offered by Alan Wake were more than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately, it isn't. I enjoy it because when I first played it years ago I had no idea that video games could handle narrative in this fashion. I'll always have a nostalgic appreciation for it and it just kills me to provide a mixed recommendation. But if you want more than story and atmosphere, look elsewhere, because you'll be sorely disappointed by everything else. If story and atmosphere suffice, though, get Alan Wake right away.

												Personally, Alan Wake was one of the best unique gaming experiences I've had. It's one of my all time favorite games and will be for ages. The storyline left me speechless everytime, one of the best I've experienced.This game is absolutely gorgeous! It has one of the best atmosphere I have seen. Outstanding forest environments, astounding lighting effects, smooth and fluid animations, amazing camera, perfect pacing, the attention to detail, the soundtracks, the acting and dialogues, the charachters development is all wonderfully done, and it all leaves you in an incredible cinematic experience.The presentation creates a genuine survival/horror ambience that's hard to shake and I couldn't imagine there's any way to improve it.Although the game might seem long and repetitive at some point, but with its gripping story and epic gameplay, you cannot help but want more. It is indeed a superb psychological action thriller that will keep you guessing the end. A brilliantly told ending that leaves you with questions more than answers. I think everyone needs to experience Alan Wake!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a heavily story-driven third person shooter with some horror elements here and there - that's pretty much the best I can describe it in one sentence. Visually it's good: overall the nature of this world looks beautiful: forests, mountains, lakes... it's really easy to get immersed into such an atmosphere. Though bushes look horrible and somewhat ruin the scenery and one thing that also holds Alan Wake back from being and eye candy is the texture pop-in - it's terrible, texture literally appear on your screen out of nowhere on a very short distance from you which makes it very noticeable. The gameplay is decent, you will shoot bad guys relatively often and the combat is good enough to keep you excited. The puzzles are rare and quite easy. The story is Alan Wake's strongest point: it's confusing and exciting and very interesting to follow. The story alone makes the game worth playing. Not too many games make you think about them after the end but Alan Wake does just that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is one of a kind! It is one the best games i have ever played and i enjoyed EVERY second of it.It's a psychological horror game which is about a writer who is on vacation with his wife and soon ,he has to face some weird things.Well, story is absolutely amazing (I LOVED the story). The visuals ,lighting,voice acting,music are pretty damn good!But the thing here is that either you are going to love it 100%, or you are not going to like it at all!If you like a deep story,that makes you think about the mysteries that it makes and trying to figure out ""what the hell did  just happen?"",well go ahead and buy this game.But if you just want a fast paced shooter,then probably you should move on. The gameplay is very good,but nothing special and may get repetitive for some (but not for me).So,if you are a fan of great stories,BUY it, ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is the sort of game only the people at Remedy could pull off. It has all the charm and meticulous world-building that made the Max Payne series great with the game universe having its own pop culture you're privvy to and yet managing to keep your nerves on edge.It's not a terrifying game in the sense that Amnesia or Silent Hill are (though Silent Hill is the series I'd liken it to the most) but it does its job as a suspenseful and tense survival horror nonetheless. Using light as a weapon and having to conserve your resources makes every fight an exciting one and the pacing is very well executed, giving you the occasional downtime while the story advances.The story is an interesting breed and pays homage to multiple works from HP Lovecraft and Stephen King to Twin Peaks and the Twilight Zone and does its job well to keep you playing. There are some over-arching themes that I found interesting, but that I won't spoil here. Suffice to say that as far as Survival Horror stories go, Alan Wake is at least moderately ambitious, thematically. The structure is an episodic one splitting the story in several manageable 2-3 hour long chapters giving you a clear cut between story arcs so that you can take a break for the day.The graphics make for some beautiful, if perhaps a bit dated, sceneries even if most of the game takes place at night. There is attention to detail to spare in Alan Wake and it seems to be a labor of love. The sound and voice acting are subject to little criticism and I guarantee that at least one or two tracks from the score and soundtrack will wind up in your playlist.It comes highly recommended.

												Spoiler free review!This game really hit me hard. The city of Bright Falls captures that American small town feeling perfectly in my opinion, and a big part of the charm in this game is the enviroment: It's extremely detailed, the surrounding areas that you get to explore, the characters, their dialoque, it all creates this awesome world that (at least for me) is easy to immerse in. This isn't an open world game, it's pretty linear in the end, relying more to tradiotional level-structure than fully open world, but the areas are diverse, feel real and are interesting to explore.The plot is better-than-your-average horror story. I didn't finish the extra episodes yet, so i know only the main game, but as a horror lover (note: real horror, not gore, people seem to confuse those these days) i can say that the story is good. Everything isn't handed to you, some questions are left to be answered by the player in his/her own way.Controls are tight, i played on keyboard + mouse, but controller works fine too. I didn't encounter a single bug on my playthrough, so it's a quality product. This is one of the games that shuold be on every dedicated gamer's shelf, virtual or physical shelf :D I got the physical collector's edition myself. And also the novel that this game inspired! That's how good this game is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A third-person horror game at a time when Silent Hill was faltering and Resident Evil was turning into its ridiculous movies got a lot of people excited. Alan Wake had a lot to live up to, and it's hard to say it didn't deliver. While it's not a perfect fit amidst that pantheon of horror, it does enough right to be listed as a classic of the genre. And that's not even considering its technical achievement of being one of the best console ports in history.You take on the role of Alan Wake, a successful novelist who has retreated to the remote mountain town of Bright Falls to recover from a nasty bout of writer's block. Bright Falls is one of those eclectic American towns of myth, where throwback diners and curious old ladies and traditions like DEERFEST mask a deep darkness lurking below. That darkness seizes Alan's wife Alice in a pretty intense haunted house sequence, and sets in motion his journey across backwoods Americana to uncover the truth.Right up front I want to give special attention to the story and the writing, because it's one of the few games (or pieces of media, really) that lifts from sources like Twin Peaks and Stephen King while still maintaining its own voice. Weak story or writing could sink a game like this, but Alan Wake's colorful cast of characters come alive with solid voice acting, meaningful interactions, and some absolutely endearing personalities. Take Barry for example, Alan's weaselly agent who ends up trying his hardest to battle evil while wrapped in Xmas lights and carting a cardboard stand-up of Alan.This also extends to Alan himself in a big way. He narrates the entire game in a style wonderfully reminiscent of Stephen King, pulling out anecdotes and metaphors at every turn, but with an earnest gravity to the proceedings. As you progress you'll find pages of a manuscript that bear more than a passing resemblance to the events you experience, and these are cleverly written to contain several surprises and twists. The story itself does an excellent job toeing the line between actual evil and insanity, and winds to an interesting and well-earned conclusion that satisfies while leaving some loose ends to muse on.A good story can't save bad gameplay, but Alan Wake delivers here as well, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the narrative. Your enemies throughout the game are wreathed in darkness that renders them invincible. Armed with both guns and a flashlight, you dispatch these foes by burning off their darkness with the light, then gunning them down. It's a more engaging system than straight combat, supported by a variety of enemies large and small, and weapons that can help bring down tough groups or single opponents. There are other encounters, however, that depend entirely on your flashlight to combat and these can get pretty grating after awhile. You might also find yourself burning out on the combat a bit after hours of the same flashlight-to-gun chains.Pacing is the only real strike against Alan Wake, but it's a big one. The first few hours of the game are spent in dark forests, running through thickets and clearings to the next abandoned building. It's nice and creepy at first but this lasts for hours, way longer than it has any reason to. Once you get back to town the pace picks up a bit and sees you battling through a better variety of locales, but you still might find yourself in each for a bit too long. I beat the game after 14 hours, and I think it would have been a tighter experience at 10 or so. I might as well say now that you shouldn't expect too much horror from Alan Wake either. The locales are plenty creepy but the game has a bad habit of setting up excellent surprises with its enemies, then spoiling them with forced cutscenes showing where they're coming from.As long as those few missteps don't trip you up, Alan Wake is a fantastic experience. The story is clever and engaging, the combat is smooth and responsive, and the whole thing looks great even years out from release. Remedy somehow assembled a near-perfect port, from flawless graphics options all the way down to comfortable keyboard/mouse controls. You're sure to be impressed on the technical side, and there's plenty to keep you going as you unravel the plot. Alan Wake has become a classic for me, polished and competent enough to stand among Silent Hills and Resident Evils for action and spooks alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It very quickly becomes not ""scary"" and much more focused on shooting arenas. That being said, it's not a bad game since the combat is OK, the story is interesting and the characters are too.All in all it's a solid game and if you can get it on a sale it's definitely worth it.

												A repetitive yet refreshing gameplay experience that isn't afraid to tread new ground even if it's not got the potential to be more than a single game.Alan Wake is a story-driven game set in a beautiful location. From an early stage you're taught to be afraid of the dark. It's intriguing and obscure as you journey through a nightmare, running from light to light, armed with a flashlight and occasional flare as you're persued by dark creatures. Between the scary night stages are relaxing daytime stages that come as a genuine relief and also serve to progress the story.I'm pleased to say thart the game unnerved me. It nails the queasy feeling of a nightmare perfectly as small things gradually grow into impossibly large obstacles without you realising until it's too late. There's a strange black goo that begins consuming the world and things start to shake before being hurled at you from across the level. It repeatedly lures you into a false sense of security by giving you other people to hang around with, before cruelly forcing you apart from them again and again. Towards the end of the game I had had enough but it was worth playing up to that stage.There's a recurring theme with my games collection- it's the games that I wouldn't consider to be my taste that end up being the most memorable and enjoyable. Alan Wake falls under that category. It's a one-off experience, but one that is most definitely worth the effort.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A masterful story, combining elements of Twin Peaks, Stephen King, Lovecraft, and the Twilight Zone. It is engaging story driven narrative that is well worth a play. My only criticisms are the combat can get repetative, the controls are occasionally a little loose, and the difficulty can be very inconsistant (you can sail through whole sections with ease and suddenly hit a single scene that is endless frustrating). These are minor quibbles, however, and more than made up for by the engaging story and good visuals (even for a game rapidly approaching half a decade old). Plus there's a heavy metal stage fight. That alone makes the whole game worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In Alan Wake you take up the role as a writer named...Alan Wake. After his wife goes missing you set out to find her while a Dark Presence haunts the town of Bright Falls.In Alan Wake you fight against darkness, and I really love that. Armed with a flashlight and a revolver you make your way through Bright Falls  and it's surrounding mountains and forests.The eviroments and the scenery is outstanding and it really improves the light vs darkness theme the game has. The story is fantastic. Really now, it's really good and doesn't give everything away directly, so you might have to reflect on what happened. It will still leave you very satisfied.The combat is pretty cool but it can become very tedious after a while as it can feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. But the supplies are limited so it really gives it this somewhat survival feeling.Alan Wake is not a perfect game, It's close but not perfect.Pros - Fantastic story and theme- Great enviroments and sceneryCons- The combat, it can become repetitious but I wouldn't abastain from playing the game because of this.

												this game is absolutely incredible! i like the atmosphere which makes you feel like being not in game but in real life. you feel main character's horror, you live through him, you're almost like him! it's just like in books. by the way, the game is about a mystic accident happened to Alan Wake, famous american writer, and our goal is to find out what the hell is going on in Bright Falls. like i've said above, it's a realistic atmosphering game BUT! one thing in it makes me want to turn off the game: gameplay is toooo slow and boring in some missions. you're just walking around without any idea why and for what purpose. for hours, man. it spoils all pleasant feelings you had before. i guess, that's the only con in game. so, i recommend this game to all fans of horror stories, movies and games. i'm sure you'll like Alan Wake. but be ready for slow-paced plot!8/10.

												My favorite game on Steam so far, bar none. The story is gripping and holds you captive right until the end. Extremely atmospheric and plays out more like a horror movie or a TV series. Has a truly captivating plot with intriguing characters and twists. One of the few games I'd give a true ten-out-of-ten to. Buy it now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is certinaly in my top favorites list. It's dark elements come from a long walk in the park, all the way to telling a great horror story about this game's famous writer, Alan Wake.Warning, heavy spoiler alert!PresentationThe enviroments around you are... lets say ""Dark"". For more then half the duration of the game you will be running underneath the night sky so it makes sense, right? Well, go take a walk in the park at night time, then come back to tell me if thats still the only dark thing you've encountered. Basically the darkness around you in this game is out to kill you. It will do anything within it's powers to have you stopped. Even if it's means using someone you know to turn agaisn't you. The darkness corrupts peoples minds, turning them into the Taken. All you have at your arsernal to defend yourself with is a flashlight, and a gun. Use the flashight to drive the darkness out from them, making them mortal again. But they have already been infected by the darkness, you can't save them now. Try not to think too much about the fact your killing people, infact you would be doing them a favor by putting them out of their misery. Trust me, be glad you did.StoryYou are playing as author, Alan Wake going on a vacation with your wife, Alice.Alan wanted to take this vacation as a break, he hasn't written a single story since his last publishing 2 years ago.However,  going by the scenaries of their vacation location,  Alice encourages Mr. Wake to write again. But he refuses, stating that he took this vacation just to avoid that. She grew ignorrant of him, egging him on about writing again, not to mention that she insists on him seeing a doctor because he dosen't want to bloody write. Man, how many kicks to the head does it take for one to simply understand ""When I don't want to do something, thats that, don't go thinking I'm a mad man now just because I stopped writing books 2 years ago!""Moving on, Alan finally loses it with Alice about the writing stories thing, storming outside to take a breather in the dark where she won't follow him. Alice suffers from Nyctophobia, a fear of darkness. Things turn upside down however when Alan eventually comes to his senses. He discovers the lights had gone out within the Cabin where he and his wife were staying. With Alice screaming, Alan makes a mad dash back to the cabin. But she was gone.Somehow, Alan had not only just lost his wife, but found himself waking up to a nightmare of events, based on a story he couldn't even remember writing.  What happened to Alice? How can Alan forgive himself? Well, that's for you to find out :PThe story became one of my favorites of all time. Can someone seriously tell me if this game has a book to it, because I want to read it, dammit xDReview ConclusionDo I recommend this? If your into the horror genre and like action with heavy story based dialouge, go for it! I love this game, it's certainly in my top list :D I still think you would be better off getting it on Sale, the price just seems a bit much for me which is the only negative thing I have to say. Thank you for reading and I hope you all take care!Personal Score11/10 Would play this again! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Alan Wake	 You don't play this game for the gameplay, you play this because you want a unique story.	'Alan wake is such an underrated game', is what I heard a lot before I decided to play this game. So is it actually an underrated gem, or simply average at best? After playing through it twice and collecting way too much collectibles (a grant total of 298, not taking the DLC into account), I think I can give you a clear view of what the game is like. Wether or not it's a hidden gem for you depends on what you are actually looking for in a game. If it's raw action you seek, you will probably be disappointed. If it's a scary horror experience, you'll probably end up with the same experience. Then what is this game? The best description will probably be a story-based thriller, if that's even a genre for a game. Specs	How does it run, you ask? I can't really help you with that. The only thing I can say is that it run well on a pretty slow system (read: my laptop :p). And if it ran smoothly on that old toaster, I'm pretty sure it will run nicely on your *whateveryouhave* aswell. Controls	To be honest I have no idea what the controls with mouse and keyboard are like. I've read somewhere that they are bit clunky, but than can also be said about the way the controls work on a controller, even though it's a xbox port. After a while you'll get used to it though, although I must say that the actually car controls are pretty horrible. Luckily, you don't have to deal with that for an extreme long amount of time.  Gameplay	As I said before, gameplaywise Alan Wake isn't the strongest of games. It's actual description as a horrorgame doesn't fit what it actually is like. Sure, you have some horror-aspects, but does that alone make a horrorgame? No. Especially because those aspects don't evolve during your playthrough. You'll get used to the dark atmosphere of grey fog blowing all over the place. Your first hour, maybe two hours, can be scary because of that, but after that you get used to it. The actually gunplay feels somewhat unique, since you need to shine your flashlight for a certain amount of time at the enemies before they can be hurt. However, this type of combat becomes very repetitive after a while, which is the biggest problem Alan Wake has from preventing it to be a brilliant game. But what makes it that people think it's still a hidden gem then? Story It's very simple: the story of this game. The story of this game is simply brilliant. The big difference between a lot of games nowadays and this game is that most of those have a story that's serving the gameplay. For Alan Wake it's the opposite (although I think the story is exactly long enough to kepp the gameplay somewhat interesting). The story is unique, and not only that, it's also presented in a unique way. Aside from the main character giving you his thoughts about the situation, you also get to collect pages of the story you're experiencing. That way you can sometimes read what will come in your path, which is very unique. Even though the story does feel a bitlackluster at the beginning of the game, it will be compensated big time when you hit a certain point in the game. It pretty much needs to 'warm-up'.  DLC	Since there's is a bundel with DLC along with this game, I figure I'll add a small review about the DLC aswell. Both are short and sweet, giving more of a challenge in the gameplay than the actual game. They add some new features to the gameplay, although the main concept stays the same (of course). The biggest role the DLC plays is extending the story, giving new insights. Both the DLC will take aroung 2-3 hours to complete, depending on how completely you want to scout the areas.  tl;dr	So, is Alan wake a hidden gem? Still depends on what you seek in a game. It has both strenghts and weaknesses. Gameplaywise the game gets repetitive quite quickly, although the story is the thing that keeps the game running. I can't tell you wether or not you'll like this game, since I can't see what type of gamer you are. What I can say is that I, as someone who loves getting into a good story, really enjoyed this game, even to the point where I declared it one of my favorites. To me, it was most definitely a hidden gem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Stephen King once wrote that “Nightmares exist outside of logic, and there’s little fun to be had in explanations; they’re antithetical to the poetry of fear.” In a horror story, the victim keeps asking ""Why?"" But there can be no explanation, and there shouldn’t be one. The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest, and it’s what we’ll remember in the end. My name is Alan Wake. I’m a writer.""This qoute exactly shows what this game is. This game is a tribute to great horror writers like: Stephen King and H.P. Lovecraft. Excellent combination of thriller and a bit of horror athmosphery. Fantastic story where's always a mystery: Alan Wake is writer who for vacations goes to a little town called Bright Falls, which resemble Twin Peaks, with his wife Alice. After moving to theirs house, they start an argue and Alan walks out of it. After some time he hear screams. He run into the house to check what happened, then he finds his wife in the lake, he jumps after her and he... wake up in the car. Yeah, the rest is mystery and it's revealing itself during story playthrough. What makes the mystery more mysterious is that we're finding manuscript pages in which a little glipse into the future is written. Graphics is beautiful with fantastic landscapes. Fighting with enemies is interesting and unique too, we can't just shoot them, no, the light is our strongest ally. First is needed to light the enemies until theirs ""darkness shield"" is off, then we can shoot. It's not a shooter game so there isn't too much of a weapon choice, couple of rifles, revolver, flash granades and flares. Too bad that there's no puzzles at all, most of them look like: go from A point to B point, but still game is fantastic. The last what I want to write about is game soundtrack. Alan Wake has fantastic OST! I can even say that OST from this game will be in my Top 3 OST's from games. :)Pros: Story, story and story Music Characters Graphics Thriller athmosphereCons: No puzzles Game can sometimes resemblence shooter My rating: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Summary of my Review Approach (To give you a glimpse of how I play the game that may or may not affects my experience)I play it on Normal difficulty. I've split my gameplay into 2 period. The 1st to the 3rd chapter are played a few months before the rest are finished. I love all game's genre but I am more of a survival horror fans and Resident Evil is my favourite game.The following are some noticable tech pros and consPros+ Graphic is amazing. It is very atmospheric and the graphic fits the game.+ Game mechanics are very creative.+ AI is very interactable with. They do react to the light.+ The bugs and glitches aren't easily spotted as it doesn't affect the overall gameplay experience.+ Well ported from Xbox 360Cons- I push the volume to max but the sound produced are imbalance. It could be my laptop's problem but it happens to this game only.The following are just some in-game elements I like/dislike based purely on my opinionLikes* Combat mechanics is very interesting. I like the sound of bullet impact. It really feels like hitting the enemies hard.* Environment. The levels are very creatively designed especially the last few chapters. The whole game is very atmospheric.* Characters. Charming, Humorous, Evil and such. It is very interesting to watch as the characters developed.* The light and darkness concept. It strongly inspire me with it's metaphor. Light in the game always give you a sense of secure and relief and darkness gives you a sense of death and fear.* Special Features Chapters. Ironically, best part in the game for me.Dislikes# Story. It has an interesting concept but it is dully presented. The structure is quite boring to me.# Item management. You can't keep your items for the following section/chapter of the game. Whenever a chapter/section starts, you start with barehand, torchlight or a gun.# Manuscript. It is an optional collectibles throughout the game. Some are fun to read, some are good to sleep.# Soundtrack. Not as atmosperic, romantic and engaging when it comes to the specific scenes.At first, I hated this game because it wasn't what I expect it to be like. It changes my view as I progress afterthat.

												What the hell was that sound? Oh man I’m freaking out right now. These damn shadows seem to move and all I have is this small flashlight. To make things even worse I have some guy screaming ""You take two pills in the morning.... and then you'll be nice and calm all day"" in some demonic voice. Ya my nerves aren’t racked.Alan Wake is a psychological survival horror that will scare you and amaze you at the same time. You play as Alan Wake an author who is on vacation with his wife to get some relaxation in or so he thinks. Once you arrive in the nice little town of Bright Falls things start getting a little weird when some old lady in black gives you keys to a cabin on Cauldron Lake. You arrive at the cabin and are trying to get settled in when your wife screams. You find the porch railing broken and an image of her drowning in the water, so you dive in after her only to wake up in your wrecked car with no clue how you got there. This is the beginning of your insanely scary story to find your wife Alice and the secrets behind Cauldron Lake.The story through the game is fantastically written and is actually your book come to life. Voice acting is superb and fits each character well. The support characters are likable and funny and help bring more depth to the story. Barry, your manager, is probably one of the best sidekicks I’ve seen in a game with his humorous, pushy personality. Your fight is against the darkness which takes over people in town and makes them way scarier. The best though is the lines they spew at you when running around in the dark. Things like ""Omega 3 fatty acids are good for your heart"" and ""There are 65 billion cows and pigs in the world!"" will have you laughing and also wondering what the hell are they talking about.There’s a total of 6 chapters that the game is broken up into and in-between each one is some great music to listen to. It may help you relax a bit before beginning another chapter of horror. In the beginning of each chapter they also give you a recap of the previous one in case you took a break and forgot some things. I found this really cool and thought it should be an option in many games. How many times have you not been able to get back to a game and then forgot what, when, and where.Wake’s gameplay is some of the best mechanics of light and dark. You use a flashlight to find your way around in the dark and is also used to help fight the Taken. The Taken cannot be killed until blasted with light for a little bit, then you can shoot them with your gun to take them out. Inanimate objects can also be taken over but those only need to be blasted by light for some time. When shining your light on your enemies you will see a small halo that will shrink and then disappear when they are vulnerable to regular weapons. Other items to help you fight the darkness are your typical guns like a handgun, shotgun, or rifle. Then there are the light items like flares, flash grenades and a flare gun. The flash grenades and flare gun will actually destroy the Taken most of the time without need of your guns.Many collectibles are scattered around the chapters for you to find. TV’s you switch on to watch a small episode of Night Springs similar to the great classic Twilight Zone and radios you can listen to and hear what may be going on in town. 100 coffee thermoses scattered all over the place to find and even manuscripts which are the actual story of the game. Some of the manuscripts can also only be found on the hardest difficulty nightmare which adds more replay value to the game. Then there are the secret stashes you can discover by finding glowing marks with the flashlight. Alan Wake is a well put together game and feel it’s overlooked by many. It’s well written story, great voice acting, and challenging gameplay make this a must play game. I’d really love to see an actual sequel come out for this but those may be some high hopes. If are looking for something to pull you in then don’t hesitate to play Alan Wake.Bear Rating: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a lot of dark fun. In dark forests, fighting against dark people imbued with dark power on a dark night. Fighting with light is quite original. Aiming with flashlight is done very well, though one could be bothered by the lack of a crosshair. Its absence adds to the great immersion this game allows. What I hated though was the terribly weak sprint capability of the player character. It would be nice to add a sprint bar to the HUD. The story events are comprised of narration by Alan Wake and unchronologically placed manuscript pages (meaning we know what will happen in a few moments), that detail actions by the many characters of this game. I liked Barry, Sheriff Sarah and Dr. Hartman the most. The ensemble of voice actors did a great job though many people don't like it. Alan Wake's model did a great job as a live-action actor as well. The story is very mysterious and leaves you in the dark most of the time, though it has a satisfying pace and finale. Some people say the game is too easy. Well, I would definitely tell them to try the game's Nightmare Mode or the significantly harder DLCs. The soundtrack has some great tunes, mostly rock songs (like Space Oddity) and the industrial score for the game is nice. The story is not pure gold, it's pretty B movie, which isn't a bad thing, but I didn't pay much attention to it during my second playthrough. The first one was indeed very satisfying (even with hundreds of collectibles).8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake tells you the story of a writer named Alan Wake, who's on vacation with his wife, until he's attacked by a dark presence, and taken away your wife. The story of this game is based on a manuscript which you can find as a collectible, and you can read it to know what's gonna happen next.In the game you fight your enemies with two sets of weapon. A light, and a gun. This combat mechanic is quirky but fun in it's own way.While you're controlling Alan, you can hear his narration through out the whole game. Expressing his feeling, and thoughts, which makes the story more interesting.On overall i give it around 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As far as storytelling and production values go (aside from low-res cut scenes) Alan Wake is great. The story is interesting and will keep you guessing and resolves itself admirably. Unfortunately, the game play can't keep up.Alan Wake isn't your typical third person shooter. You have a very limited amount of supplies to deal with what seem like impossible odds. While it's possible to overcome these odds in this game, it usually comes at the cost of constant trial and error and dealing with some seriously clunky movement and aiming mechanics. The worst offender are platforming sections which have NO place in a game of this kind other than to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the player with cheap deaths. The jumping mechanic is simply horrendous and you sometimes never end up where you wanted to. As far as getting all the achievements this one had a few tough ones. The toughest come in the form of ""complete x part of the story without restarting a checkpoint."" This being the PC release we get all the DLC and there are two of these (one for each piece of DLC) there and one in the main story. Aside from that there is a ridiculous number of collectibles for the single player campaign. Fortunately, most of these can be picked up using chapter select but some achievements require collecting all items in that set in a full play through (which isn't that bad considering you'll likely play through the whole game twice for the difficulty achievements).Overall I recommend this game to people who love a good mystery or good storytelling in games in general. Just be forewarned about the controls and the combat. They can be quite a pain.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Alan Wake		* 9/10To be honest I didn't know this title until it's been out from years and was already on heavy sale. Lucky me. I knew Remedy for their masterpiece, Max Payne, so when I realized Alan Wake was their latest game I took it without further inquiries. And I really believe I was right.Alan Wake is a third action (and I dare to call it) survival shooter (considered the measured amount of ammos and the weak constitution of the protagonist). You are Alan Wake, a world best seller Writer... Kind of a Stephen King level of Fame. Due to the amount of stress after the writing of the last book Alan is retiring with his beloved Wife Alice in a small mountain town called Bright Falls. When they get to their cabin Alice is abducted by a dark entity and pulled to the depth of Cauldron Lake. Alan will then realize that there's something really odd and dark happening in Bright Falls and their citizens.The game is structured as a classic third person shooter, but you won't have any mass destruction weapon, nor you won't have any huge amount of ammos. The most interesting concept in the gameplay is the contrast between light and darkness, so when the Takens (citizens possessed by darkness) approach you, you must light them with your torch first in order to get rid of their ""protective dark aura"" and be able to shoot them and eliminate them. Also there are few street lamps here and there that will give you protection against them (and serve as checkpoint as well). Besides, this game is definitely full of collectibles that will lead to various achievements.Anyways this game It's not about the gameplay (which actually includes funny sections where you can drive a car which can be used to quickly enlight the takens and drive over them B-) ), nor about the graphics, which is nice and always shows beautiful landscapes and ambiences. It's about the story, which is not original but involving. Besides the unexpected end, the story is quite linear and explicative but its strong side is how it gets you involved with the main protagonist and other characters. And this is one of the few times it happened to me, because the game isn't what I'd call revolutionary or innovative yet I'm still playing it, or better, re-playing to attempt a 100% completion which is something I rarely attempt on this kind of games.The story and the settings are quite dark, almost horror. Almost because you'll never jumpscare nor be afraid or stressed as in other games like, I don't know... Amnesia, maybe? But it's still a great setting anyways. The story doesn't end on its own as there are a couple of DLCs included: ""The Signal"" and ""The Writer"" Which follow after the end of the original game (no spoiler about it, as they're strictly bound to the end).+++PROs+++ ALAN WAKE. This game is a story about the protagonist, his insecurities, his struggle to help Alice even though all the odds are against him. I liked the character and how he relates to the other caracters in the game, I like how he's narrating the facts and his thoughts as if he was reading pages of a book, not to mention te ending of the game. GAMEPLAY. It's not a huge innovation but the way you need to face your enemies -(light them first, then shoot) is a very creative and fitting idea. Not to mention the huge amount of collectibles that might contribute in increasing the playability of the game. And don't forget the driving sections, taking downs enemies by night and breathing fresh air by day in those mountain streets... LANDSCAPES And AMBIENCES. I definitely loved all the views this game offers you, mountains, lakes, rivers, valleys, not to mention the various locations. MUSIC. There are tracks that really are great (just don't touch anything in the main menu and let go the trailer), not to mention the credit rolls at the end of each episode, while ingame there are some interesting tunes that will follow your action giving the right ominous or appropriate mood for the situation. Really a great job.---CONs--- STAMINA. I understand that considering the survival side of the game you can't be a professional runner but seriously, I can run way more than Alan does, and I'm spending my entire days sitting at work...

												An atmospheric horror adventure with a back story in the spirit of Stephen King. Third-person shooter where enemies have to lose the dark protection by casting light and then they are vulnerable to regular ranged weapons. Pros:+ excellent atmosphere, very interesting plot, reach the peak with the two DLC chapters + nice environment, graphics and models+ visual and sound effects+ music soundtrack (++ to Space Oddity)+ good duration, the two DLCs are perhaps the best part of the game+ varied ways for environmental kills especially in the DLCsCons- enemy variation is very limited- gameplay can be repetitive- gameplay can be repetitive- gameplay can be repetitive...All in all, a highly recommended title with the only drawback (but an important one) that especially at the beginning it lacks variety.Hint: The DLCs, included in the game, can be accessed in the chapter selection once you finish the game.

 Alan Wake  Psychological thriller with a view of a third person. The main character is a production of Alan Wake creator of great novels, which for several years without being able to write a good book. His wife decides to take him on vacation to the town of Bright Falls. However, his wife disappears under mysterious circumstances, and our hero decides to find her. The game is about finding fragments of books thanks to them we will know more about the storyline. During the trip you will come across various characters with whom we will be able to talk but also to opponents, possessed by darkness people who were sent to destroy us. The fight against them is to continue shining a flashlight on their bodies to weaken them and to their finish we will have at our disposal several types of weapons. The game offers a nice world to explore, but it is linear and we will move on foot or by car. The biggest advantage of the game is pretty visuals. Graphically looks great, play of light in this title is amazing, giving the game the climate and anxiety, pleasant sound effects and background music are a huge asset to this production. Personally, I had a lot of fun while playing this game and I finished a couple of times and I'm definitely able to recommend this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Deep psychological thriller at its best. The suspense keeps you on your toes all the time. The writing is brilliant, acting and voice acting are just tasty, dramatic events unfold like in a movie  - well, that's what the authors wanted, whole game feels like a movie. TwinPeaks-ish movie.Once you get used to clumsy camera and controls, you're all set to enjoy this intense ride.The visuals are beautiful (I made a ton of screenshots), design is awesome, sounds are engulfing, and the music... both original and licensed, it adds A LOT to the mood. Combat is satisfying, too. A lot of collectibles and achievements, if you're into that stuff.Overall, this is a must-play and unforgettable experience			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though the camera can cause issues and the supernatural story that's more interested in asking questions than answering them, it's a tough game to put down once you've started. Remedy's done a great job of mixing elements of written work, television, and videogames to create an experience full of scares, laughs, and thrills that's just as fun to play as it is to watch.

												A fantastic (but short) atmospheric game relying on its strongpoints of storytelling to make up for what can be seen as shortcomings in the action sequences. A great deal of effort is put into engrossing the player in its world, setting up th e game as an episodic miniseries, complete with intros, recaps, and outros, as well as plenty of collectibles and side tihngs to find that expand on what's happening. The game plays well, but unfortunately combat can fall short and become repetitive, since the tools at your disposal are few and mostly upgrade in pure numbers. It's tense enough to keep you on your toes, but playing on normal/hard, i never felt truly stretched for resources except once during the game. There are only a few enemy types so combat becomes fairly formulaic after a time.That said, the presentation of the game, and the story it tells make up for the difference in spades, and it's a shame the game only got two small DLC episodes instead of the true ""second season"" it deserved.Would definitely recommend to fans of the thriller/mystery genre, as long as you're OK with never really finding out what happens after the end.

												The story is fantastic however it's fairly linear which is aight as there are a good amount of secrets to be found if you stray from the path when you can. Controls are your standard WASD to move, mouse one to shoot, and mouse two to shine flashlight. Enemies can be overwhelming and are a bit faster then the character which makes outrunning them to get to the nearest light source pretty difficult and basically requires you to fight which is alright. You aren't going to find a shortage of supplies before fighting either but don't let that discourage you from looking around to find things as this game doesn't really have a crosshair and if you have no idea where to shoot or have incredibly poor aim you'll find yourself missing shots, so yeah. Overall it's a great game, I'm glad I picked it up when I did, hopefully you will too.			",319,38,4,30,12,4,17

												Alan Wake is a Xbox 360-Third-Person-Shooter from 2010, february 2012 it was released for the PC. The graphics are a bit dusty at a closer look (textures).I do not want to say so much , which is also in the description. Only that you play the role of the writer Alan Wake. "" Alan Wake"" is a good game for people that like it creepy and action-packed. It's a super exciting game which can be played almost like a movie / book.It's as if you participate in one of the older Stephen King novels, the program will zoom in the American Nightmare (which is also the title of the addon).I have the game (medium difficulty) now almost through and is still increasing my heart rate.

 Pros -The atmosphere is well realized. Creates a real sense of tension. -The sound cues and voice acting is top notch. -The graphics are still incredible-The story is very good. -The tension that the game play brings is fun. Using light as a weapon is a good change of pace. -Chapters are set up like a TV show. In game TV show ""Night Spring""  is very good as well as the radio show.  Cons -Game play can be a bit clunky at times.-Enemy variety-Toward the end the game throws a lot of enemies at you. -In game advertisement is very abrasive. Neutral The collectibles adds a lot to the story but trying to find them can take you out of the moment.Extremely fun game. Grab it and play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An amazing game, I recommend it to all of those who seem to be interested in weird plots and horror itself. The game itself isn't really that scary since the enemy itself is darkness and in order to fight darkness you would equip a flashlight or turn on lights xd. It may seem pretty childish like back in those time when we were afraid of the dark but the plot is actually pretty good. The order of the events and playing the role as Alan Wake a writer seems very unique in a way.This game has many options that most horror games don't. The thing I love the most about this game is the fact that you can like drive cars it may seem like a small add on but it's very fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Almost 9 years ago, I noticed this game on a magazine.It was said this game would be a PC games. Unfortunately, this game didn't launch on time. However, I played this game on X360, but I still want to play it on PC. Because I still remember Remedy said they will show the best  graphics on PC . I was using a one core cpu when I saw this game on magazine, and they said this game would support Dual_core cpu! It's really a long time for waiting.Whatever It's really a perfect game , every side of it is perfect. But I suggest, you'd better use a XBOX controller to fit the game control setting.

												You play as Alan Wake, a best-selling writer. After a few years, Alan is unable to write anything. His wife, hoping to help him with his thoughts, brings him to Bright Falls. Once you drive to your cabin, Alan gets into an argument with his wife and storms out. Darkness consumes the cabin and Alan's wife disappear. He runs outside and sees his wife in the lake and jumps in. Afterward, he finds himself in his car with a head injury, with no memory of what happened after he dove in the lake.The core story spans six episodes, each crafted like part of a TV miniseries. After the first episode's exposition each that follows ends with a cliffhanger, fades to a title screen and then transitions into a plot recap as the next begins.  To finish the game it takes a bit over 10 hours, the story may seem a bit short, but collectible items like hidden coffee thermoses and collectible manuscripts, which tell more and more about Alan Wake's story, offer some incentives to return to Bright Falls. Alan Wake has stellar lighting effects and environmental design that creates an atmosphere to make the scares and thrills more affecting. The game is full of shadows and effects that put the mood of the game into good use.The in-game music is atmospheric and totally in-tuned with the story. The moments of tension were always made better because of the music. Alan Wake is truly a masterpiece. It proves that survival-horror can be very well done with an intelligent story. I can highly recommend this game to all.Sounds 10/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

Not in a good way either, it seemed to drag on so long.  Another reason that I just can't reccomend the game is gameplay.  The combat is incredibly simple and repetitive.  It's 10 hours of the same content with a decent story in the background.  If you like Stephen King type stuff and it's on sale, grab it.  Otherwise you can make a better purchase.

												Alan Wake is a horror game. Its strong aspects include a well-written story and presentation that captivates and spurs the gamer onward; at the same time, its dreadful atmosphere and setting thrills the gamer to the edge.Its unique game mechanics are well-done and ties in thematically to the story.However, it does have some flaws. Its enemy variety becomes repetitive halfway through the game. The different episodes mostly feature the same woodlands/farm/countryside setting which can get boring. Thankfully, the game picks itself up in the later episodes and the game-play becomes more engaging and interesting.My review of the sequel, Alan Wake's American Nightmare, can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenghuang/recommended/202750/ ",60,12,0,0,3,0,6

												Alan Wake has a really interesting story and a main character that is flawed enough not to be a Hollywood style bad♥♥♥♥♥♥hero, but motivated enough to press on in the face of adversity. You might find the plot difficult to follow, but give it a chance. It's smooth and creamy and goes down easy, like dipping your sack in melted butter, but it's not your sack, it's your brain. The combat system is pretty clever. While the ""Over the shoulder shooting"" style game isn't an original idea, the way the enemies are made vulnerable is both relevant to the plot and smart enough that it creates tension without having to have foes burst out of air ducts every 5 seconds, using shock to replace fear. It's challenging and frightening in a story driven way, like a good novel, but it's not a novel, it's a game. Go on, give it a go. It's no doubt much cheaper these days and it still holds up, even after all these years. The whole thing is very refreshing, like jumping into a cool lake. Only it's not a lake, it's an ocean.

												I played American Nightmare before playing this one, so i was kinda dropped into the story without having knowledge of the backstory of the characters and the main plot itself. When this game went on sale, i immediately bought it because i enjoyed American Nightmare, so i thought that probably i would enjoy the main game even more and i did.The combat system its not the best, but its okay for PC. The story itself and the events that happen on the game are pretty good, the idea of the darkness vs light was innovative for its time and for people that like good storylines in videogames, you have here a good example of it.I could see Alan Wake as a TV show, but i enjoyed it a lot as a videogame and i wish they release a sequel of the game, maybe to close this series with a ""happy ending"" to Alan´s story. I think the guy deserves it by now.8/10. I carry a flashlight everytime i go out in the darkness, just in case. Thx Remedy Entertainment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake tells the thrilling story of a writer suffering from writer's block who has travelled to the small town of Bright Falls with his wife to get away from the pressures of being a best selling author. However shortly after arriving in the mysterious town his wife goes missing under unusual circumstances as a seemingly supernatural presence haunts his every move.The story unfolds over 6  (+2 DLC) episodes each opening with their own 'previously on' segment and credits sequence accompanied by some pretty good episode appropriate music. The pacing of each episode does a great job of slowly building intrigue about the mystery of what is going on in this Twin Peaks-esque town and propelling you forward into what's to come. There are mellow, slower moments in which you interact with the town's quirky characters and history as well as tense, fear inducing moments in which you battle against people possessed by the darkness which hunts you down. The majority of the game has you battling the dark presence with just a flashlight and a small array of guns, flares and flashbang grenades. You use the flashlight and flares to deteroiate the shield of darkness covering the enemies, followed by using your guns to finish the job. This sequence is repeated ad nauseam. At first, this makes every combat encounter meaningful and frantically tense and goes a long way towards making the Dark Presence feel like something you have no hope of fighting against in the grand scheme of things. Although this feeling doesn't last long as the lack of enemy variety and weapon selection causes things to drag towards the latter half of the game and the game does little to add variety to the combat encounters other than throwing more enemies at you. As I became more invested in seeing how the artfully told story unfolds, I became less interested in foraging for supplies and engaging in the combat and simply attempted to run past all of the enemies as it became more and more frustrating to deal with the barrage of seemingly never ending enemies.The game is also littered with collectibles; There are coffee thermoses, another homage to Bright Falls inspiration Twin Peaks; An in game FMV TV show entitled 'Night Springs', which is very heavily inspired by episodes of The Twilight Zone; Radio's which provide insight into the town and it's inhabitants through nocturnal radio host Pat Maine and Prophetic manuscript pages written by Alan Wake which foreshadow events that transpire throughout the game, each one fully narrated by the protagonist. The abundance of collectibles combined with the games fairly large environments make you want to explore every nook and cranny to uncover as much of the narrative content there is to see but in doing so you'll find yourself engaging in more and more of the quickly tiring combat as the longer you find yourself in the darkness, the more opponents you'll find yourself fighting against which seems completely antithetical to itself. I often found myself battling the compulsive urge to find everything with the desire to engage in as little of the combat as possible. Despite these shortcomings, I found the intrigue and mystique of the story was more than enough to hook me and keep me playing and interested. Each episode ends in a way that propels you forward and the authorial nature of the protaganist, who frequently shares his often hammy thoughts through voiceover narration, will get you invested in the characters and in discovering what's going on and leave you wanting for more when it reaches the final credits.

												Much human thought and culture has been dedicated to explaining the unknown and thus making it safe. Videogames have too rarely explored the themes of the unknowable inspiring creativity but Alan Wake wants to make the effort. It is a game about an artist changing reality with his gift and facing the darkness, both inside and outside the mind.Alan Wake, the titular novelist, has attained success precious few novelists can even imagine including a downright luxurious apartment in New York City and high visibility in the talk show circuit. He is also a dark, brooding man with only his wife Alice and agent-and-best-friend Barry being his only windows to the humanity in general. A vacation to the mountains and forests of Washington state becomes a nightmare for our hero when his wife is taken by the darkness sending Alan on his quest. The story is central to the game but it is unfortunately impossible to discuss it in detail without posting spoilers. Suffice to say that it is a mixed success. Alan comes off more petulant than tortured and his disdain for people in general renders him unpleasant, especially considering his winning hand in life. What makes this worse is that the writers are on Alan's side and the people he hates turn out to be hateable. The cast has an another Achilles' heel as well in Barry. He is one of those hustling agent types familiar from many, many movies about Hollywood. It makes no sense that someone like that could be on the top of the literary food chain and his career-boosting ideas are inept indeed. His attempts at comedic relief are also a mismatch for the sombre tone of the game in general. Since Alan and Barry get most of the screen time a thickness of skin is recommended.The first and most important rule in depicting genius artists in fiction is always the same: do not show their work for genius cannot be replicated. Alan Wake the game apparently does not approve of this rule for Alan Wake the novelist has pages of his fiction scattered throughout the game as collectibles. The prose is so incompetent that I would have preferred Alan reciting from The Lusty Argonian Maid instead. Sadly these are not the only collectibles for the intense nightmare also has room for beer can pyramids, coffee thermoses and more. You cannot start a generator without passing a QTE test either. The ladders are also something of a mystery: why do I have to first press the action key to mount and then the movement key to climb the damn thing -- with a prompt appearing to tell me what to do? Why can't I be allowed to disappear into the game instead? Alan also has a highly irritating tendency to narrate the events, in effect repeating the things the player is already experiencing or making utterly baffling remarks such as: ""I had fallen off so many cliffs it was ridiculous."" There is still reason to shut out all this (and a few other things) and focus on the strenghts, the ones that make Alan Wake a game worth experiencing. The forests at night are otherworldly and threatening and I have not seen ones like them elsewhere in gaming. I was most relieved to be allowed to switch off the HUD to complete the atmosphere. The town of Bright Falls also has proud Twin Peaks influences which were highly pleasing to see. Graphics may have some Xbox 360 ruggedness but the nighttime sights are still powerful. The main gameplay element besides experiencing the story is the combat. Alan needs to peel away the darkness protecting the Taken before using his guns to end them. The arsenal consists of a revolver, two varieties of shotguns and hunting rifle which fits the setting perfectly. You also have to reload them one bullet at a time which adds to the intensity of the encounters. The other group of equipment are the light sources you carry, from flashlights and flashbangs to the flare gun which is here the BFG 9000 superweapon it rarely gets to be. Alan isn't particularly nimble either so the process of avoiding enemy attacks, firing and reloading weapons and knowing when to use light requires a steady hand. I found this all pleasurable to do and felt skilled but not invincible after defeating a particularly dangerous group.Alan Wake would certainly have benefited from tough but fair editing. Had the designers been free from the pressures of fitting into the general design of console gameplay of the time and had the writers focused more on presenting questions and invoking mystery than churning out language something unique could have been achieved. But while Alan Wake is a mixed triumph it is still a triumph. The feel of wandering in someone elses dream is palpable in the best sequences as is the intensity in many battle scenes, and the contrast between light and dark is used in many creative and thematically appropriate ways. Those looking for pleasure in nightmare should find some in Alan Wake and I can recommend the game for anyone in the mood for exploring the unknown.			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												Alan Wake is one of my favorite games this generation. Remedy studios has made an other masterpiece. It is a Psychological thriller that will keep you unhinged. You start off as a famous bookwriter taking a vacation with your wife in the pacific north west. Shortly after you arrive at your cabin your wife goes missing and all hell breaks loose. Alan Wake breaks away from basic third person shooters making the combat very unique. Your strongest wepon is the light. Your main wepon is a flashlight to weaken the dark ones, guns and limited ammo to finish them off. Right off the bat the whole game and story is told like a Stephen King novel with perfect storytelling. Also breaks down each chapter like a tv series recapping what happened making you even more excited to play. Masterfully crafted music, sounds, and voice acting are nothing below perfect the whole game.Area's are dark and very explorable looking for extras like flares or thier own crazy in game tv show night springs. Game is not to long but not to short either. Characters and the story are so interesting you will have no idea what to expect. Combat while unique can be a bit underwhelming if you are use to guns ablazing. In the end this is a game that you should not slip by it honestly might change your life. Go buy the book too.Console Score 9.5/10Final Score 9.75/10			",322,54,9,41,30,5,36

 Alan Wake is a game you should definitely play.If I had to describe Alan Wake in one word, the word would be “Fantastic”. The game is really unique in a few aspects. In the game you play as Alan Wake who is writer from New York. He's not a soldier, he has no combat training, he is clumsy, slow, and last guy you'd pick as video game hero in every possible way. The plot alternates between a manuscript, a dream, flashbacks, and Alan being awake. This can be a little confusing, and I admit after beating the game I'm still not sure what happened. I think this is actually a plus, because it gives you a reason to replay the game, and find the rest of the manuscript. It's almost as if you put Stephan King, & the Twilight Zone in a blender.  The cutscenes, and voice acting are very well done. The story is presented in a series of six episodes, and with each episode you get the “Previously on Alan Wake” cutscenes to lead you in to the next. It's like your controlling a TV episode of the X-files. The game play is survival horror. You always be scrounging for supplies like batteries, flares, bullets, and it typically seems you have just enough to get by. The combat centers around using light from flashlights, flares, generators, or flash grenades to essentially weaken your enemies. The “Taken” are possessed with the darkness, and can only be killed when the light has removed their shield. The scenery is beautiful, the game looks great even on low settings. The lighting and effects, are all on point. The music is a perfect fit, some instrumentals, some alternative indie bands. I can't find anything negative to say about Alan Wake, I enjoyed every minute of the experience, and I'm glad I got a chance to play it. Wait, why are you still reading this? Go add this to your wishlist, or library! OLDER GAMER APPROVED  Visit our Currator Page ",134,1,0,3,3,2,1

												Step into the shoes of Alan Wake, a best-selling novelist who is going on vacation in hopes to relieve his writer's block. However, Alan has much more to think about other than his novel when his wife mysteriously vanishes, and pages of a manuscript that he doesn't remember writing suddenly begin to appear; ominously outlining events that are about to occur. Alan Wake is brought to us by the developer of Max Payne 1 and 2, Remedy Entertainment, and was initially released in 2010 for the Xbox 360 before finally making its way to PC in 2012.Things start off normal enough, you're on a ferry with your wife Alice, headed to a remote destination in the forest for your vacation. Your writer's block has been killing your career, you need the escape. You're met by friendly locals who are excited that a big-shot such as yourself will be vacationing near their little town. You stop by a gas station on your way to the cabin that you and Alice have rented, but once you come out of the bathroom things begin to go haywire. However, it's when Alice goes missing at the cabin that things really heat up. She's scared of the dark, so badly that she becomes paralyzed with fear, and now everything is dark; save for what becomes illuminated by your flashlight, and your wife is nowhere to be found.The storytelling in the game is absolutely fantastic, as Alan's inner monologue is spoken as though it is in book format. The game itself is set-up in a TV show format, where once you reach the next chapter you'll be greeted with a ""Last Time on Alan Wake"" sequence. The entire experience is like playing through a deranged horror show while listening to a coupling audio book. These unique factors only adds to the eeriness of the game, and they also add a different spin on the horror genre as a whole. For the time of release, the environments are lavishly detailed and come with a thick amount of ambiance such as fog, rain, and lightning. Most of your time will be spent in the dark, with only a flashlight to help guide you from one creepy destination to the next. While most of the baddies look the same, their potential of showing up always keeps you looking over your shoulder to make sure that you're not being chased by their near silent presence.Equipped initially with only a flashlight and a pistol, you will later find yourself with more diverse guns to battle the onslaught of evil that awaits. Even though Alan Wake is fast-paced, the fact that you never know from which direction, and when, the devious shadow-people will make an appearance keeps tight tension in the air. Combat is simple, you must shine a concentrated flashlight beam on the shadow-people to dissolve their darkness barrier, and then fill them full of bullets. Paranormal entities are abound, and even inanimate objects become possessed and deadly. When you get overwhelmed, flares and flashbangs are your best friend when it comes to keeping these monstrosities at bay. Whatever you do, your ultimate goal is to stay in the light; that's the only place that you're safe in, but well-lit areas are few and far between.To say that Alan Wake was, and still is, one of the best horror games of the last generation is an understatement. The game was initially a diamond in the rough when it was released on the Xbox 360, though it appears to have garnered the attention it deserves after being released on PC. Graphically, it doesn't even look that dated, it was very far advanced for its time when looking at other games of the same genre and time period, such as F.E.A.R. and Condemned: Criminal Origins. Alan Wake has a flair to it that no other horror title has yet to emulate, duplicate, or even attempt to replicate, it's one of the few games that have been left alone to be uniquely itself. Even six years later, this game stands as one of the horror games that must be played, but not for the price of $32.99 CAD; wait for a summer or holiday sale first.Rating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.𐌕𐋏𐌄 𐋏𐍈𐍂𐍂𐍈𐍂 𐌽𐌄𐌕𐤔𐍈𐍂𐌊 Curator | Group 𐌂𐌋𐌆𐌂𐌊 𐌅𐍈𐍂 𐌾𐍈𐍂𐌄			",1150,457,25,124,74,6,94

												An amazing story set in an incredible atmosphere, the game remains very engaging and the characters are mostly likeable throughout, it's hard to stop playing! I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you see a good deal as the game is a classic, but due to it's not perfect gameplay I can't recommend paying full price. The 2 DLC's - The Signal & The Writer - are both quite dull and seemed like the developers attempt to try new things, and it didn't really work; you'd be fine passing on these, but it leaves a few plot holes if you don't play.

												Alan Wake ist ein besonderes Spiel. Es beinhaltet Elemente, die einem sonst nur selten begegnen. So habe ich persönlich das erste mal allein mit einer Taschenlampe böse Kreaturen bekämpft. Die Grafik ist ok und das Gameplay nichts weltbewegendes, aber die Athmosphäre ist packend und fesselnd. Auf jeden Fall einen Versuch wert ;)			",2823,1117,123,335,396,32,507

Posted: October 21, 2016
												In Alan Wake, you play the titular Alan Wake, a successful writer from New York with the rather mysterious sounding name of Alan Wake. Secretly, Alan is a superhero. A Guardian of the Light. When he's asleep, he enters a parallel dimension where he roams the galaxy fighting megalomanical demi-gods and insane zealots with his trusty companions; a talking raccoon and a sentient tree. When he hears his name in the real world ""Alan... Wake... Alan... Wake..."", he wakes up and returns to the real world. Unfortunately, none of this is in the game.At the beginning of the game, Alan is on a vacation with his wife Alice MacGuffin in a Pacific Northwest town named Mystic Falls. It just so happens that Mystic Falls has a history of strange goings-on dating back hundreds of years; like the time when the town was infested by vampires and the townsfolk trapped them all under a church. More recently, there was that incident where Mr. Muldoon, the groundskeeper of the local school, dressed as a ghost as part of an elaborate scam in cahoots with a crooked property developer, but was foiled by a bunch of meddling kids and a talking dog.Seeking some peace and solitude, Alan rents an old dilapidated cabin on a tiny island at a nearby haunted lake named Lake Placid. According to the tourist brochure, the lake is used by the military as a dumping ground for failed genetic experiments and is full of weaponised piranhas, giant crocodiles, and Miley Cyrus. Even worse, it's also where Microsoft dumped all their unsold Microsoft Zunes. On a cloudless night, one can see entire shoals of Microsoft Zunes gently bobbing on the waves, a shroud of failure covering the entire lake, as far as the eye can see.However, just when Alan thought he could relax, he suddenly wakes up in a car crash with absolutely no memory of the event whatsoever. He's in a car he can't remember driving, next to an empty bottle of Vodka he can't remember drinking. When he goes looking for help, random strangers try to kill him. This is normal in New York City but unheard of in the Pacific Northwest. Even stranger still, he starts finding pages from a manuscript that he's absolutely sure he wrote but doesn't remember writing. One of them was titled ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"". Harry, Hogwarts, and Dumbledore... it all felt terribly familiar to Alan.To top it all off, Alan's wife Alice disappears under mysterious circumstances. The only clue Alan could find was Alice's phone. All it contained was a digital receipt for a one-way plane ticket to Vegas and salacious text messages to a muscular Yoga instructor named Julio. Apparently Alice loved doing the Downward Dog with Julio. Other than that, it was a complete mystery. Not deterred, Alan decides to go look for Alice. By blundering around the forest at night, in the dark, yelling her name.For some reason, a bunch of people known as 'The Taken' want to kill Alan. Why they would name themselves after a Liam Neeson movie is a mystery that's never explained. Fortunately, Alan is not totally defenceless. He's actually quite handy with flashlights. Sometimes he puts it under his chin and tells scary stories. He also waves it around and makes Lightsabre noises. But most of his fights involve him shining light in peoples faces until they get mad and try to kill him. Then he runs like a sissy girl for the next checkpoint.At this point, the line between fantasy and reality begins to blur and the storytelling takes on a surreal quality. Some guy named Billy Zane tries to help Alan. ""Alan, you're not a kid anymore, you could get hurt out there,"" said Billy Zane helpfully. Then there was a Walk-Off and David Bowie was there and some guy pulled his underpants out without removing his pants. It was all hazy to Alan. So many mysteries, so little explanation. That's why Alan Wake is so good.Clearly inspired by authors like Stephen King and Dean Koontz, the storyline and characters are typically clichéd, but nevertheless entertaining. The plucky overweight comedy relief sidekick, feisty female sheriff, sleazy doctor, fruity FBI Agent, and kidnapped wife are all there. There's even a television program in the game named Night Springs that's clearly a parody of, or perhaps a tribute to, creepy television serials such as Twilight Zone, X-Files, and Yo Gabba Gabba. The Pacific Northwest environment, on the other hand, is very well modelled. Some of the background panoramic vistas are breathtaking and complements the storytelling perfectly.The weakest aspect of Alan Wake is the combat. While it's nowhere as good or as satisfying as similar games like Resident Evil 4, it's not terrible either. But it does get repetitive. Weapon selection is limited to revolver, rifle and shotguns. Alan also gets Flares that act as temporary 'Taken Repellant', Flash Bangs that kill anything nearby like grenades, and the smart bomb Flare Gun that's best saved for boss fights.During combat, the Taken are surrounded by shadows that make them impervious to conventional weaponry. Before Alan can hurt them, he has to 'burn away' the shadows with his flashlight. This exhausts the batteries of the flashlight. He has to do this with every single Taken and there are lots of them. Managing two combat resources, batteries and ammo, can get annoying. However, flashlight energy does regenerate slowly over time when not used in combat. The game is also fairly generous with ammo, with boxes of unlimited ammo conveniently placed near some boss encounters.What is most annoying is the lack of a melee ability. If Alan runs out of ammo he's basically screwed. You'd think being from New York City he would have at least picked up some rudimentary street-fighting skills since hailing a cab usually involves some hand-to-hand combat. To even the odds, Alan has an evasion ability that allows him to dodge melee attacks, but it's flaky and unreliable. Dodging is basically just spamming the dodge action key and hoping that it works.Overall, Alan Wake is a good game with its strength being in the narrative. A nice touch is the episodic synopsis that plays before the game begins, ""Previously, on Alan Wake..."", so you won't forget who Alan Wake is. There's also lots of extra content like the 2 free DLCs, good music, and an in-game commentary. Highly recommended for those who like their mystery spiced with some action.TL;DRA mediocre mystery writer battles supernatural evil in the dark using the world's worst flashlight.

												Alan Wake is adventure third-person shooter game. You play as Alan Wake, he's a writer. Alan is going on a vacation with his wife when something has gone wrong. His wife gone missing because of something called the darkness. The darkness force Alan to write a story for her if Alan wants to see his wife again, but then the story he wrote has become real before he could wrote the ending, now Alan is trapped in his own story and has to do what he must to survive.The gameplay of Alan Wake is quite good. You play alone by yourself but in the near end you will have some companion to help you. You don't just get to shoot the enemy, as they are ghost like enemies protected by darkness aura around them, you have to neutralize them with your handheld flashlight or any kind of light source first before you can completely kill them with your weapons. Ammo is not unlimited, in fact they are very limited so you have to conserve your ammo very smart.Alan Wake has great graphics. The acting and the voice looks great. All the effects and the environment settings are so convincing, makes the game scary to play alone in the night.If you like adventure and horror story, this game is recommended for you.Rating 9/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												Alan Wake is a third person surival horror-esque game in the same vein of Resident Evil, however focusing more on story telling than engrossing gameplay or rpg like elements. Essentially you are a writer, Alan Wake, who takes a retreat to Bright Falls, a secluded retreat town, in order to find inspiration for your next work though seemingly becomes entrapped by a supernatural force that can be only described readily as The Dark. The gameplay revolves around you traversing around Bright Falls encovering the mystery, saving your girlfriend, and surviving against the force that seems to haunt you. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a story driven exprience, as while the gameplay is engaging it is incredibly repetitive and becomes my least favorite part of the game quickly.

												Draw blood from The Twilight Zone, Twin Peaks, Stephen King, the first Silent Hill, and a teensy bit from Resident Evil 4. Add some original spice here, a little flair there, predate Shadows of the Damned by about a year, and you have Alan Wake. With so many clear inspirational elements at play, and they are clear, you might think this third-person shooter would be a disjointed mess, possibly too reliant on said inspirational properties to have its own voice. And yet, the voice of its titular writer shines through to bring a surprisingly unique and competent game to the table. Alan Wake pulls from horror/weird staples of all mediums to deliver an engaging, if schlocky, story, complemented by satisfying combat and light exploration.Alan Wake is your player character, Stephen King analogue, and hero (?). A best-selling author with a hair-trigger temper, Wake has been faced with creative block for some time. He’s taken to beautiful Bright Falls, Washington by his wife, Alice, to take a breather and hopefully get back in the swing of things. But things take a turn when Alice is taken by a mysterious “dark presence,” and Wake is forced to fight through hordes of light-averse, undead-ish folk. Receiving help from a number of colorful characters along the way, Wake fights to get his wife back from the dark presence and unravel the entity’s mystery.The writing is as cheesy as the acting, which is to say, very. It works, though, in the spirit of Twin Peaks or Silent Hill. Rather than generically scary or thrilling, the game feels more interestingly off-kilter, and certainly self-aware. That said, the writing is just plain bland in several spots, but it’s made up for by the wealth of it. Collectibles are largely dominated by writing pieces in the form of radio shows, short episodes of the Night Springs (*cough* The Twilight Zone *cough*), and mysterious manuscript pages that fill in much of the plot. Out of 100+ pages, a good handful understandably fall short. The radio and television shows, however, are always a treat, and spread out far enough that stopping to listen or watch feels like a nice break rather than a momentum-killer. It’s a game about a writer (*cough* Harry Mason *cough), and it does its best to play that up.The gameplay’s core conceit is using light to disperse enemies’ darkness, rendering them vulnerable to lead-based weaponry. Your flashlight is your aiming reticle, which takes a bit of getting used to, but the slight, default, and appreciated auto-aim makes up for it. Flares, flare guns, and flash grenades are added to your repertoire over time, along rifles and shotguns to take down anything the dark presence throws at you. The one-two punch of light and lead remains satisfying throughout, largely due to the careful balance of resources. Generally, you have just enough for what need’s doing; tension builds when you’re stuck with a dinky pistol and a single clip, but I dare your confidence not to surge when you’re packing 30 shotgun rounds with flares to spare. Enemy variation is limited, unfortunately. There are five types, by my count, and honestly I hesitate to count one or two of those. Still, the majority of encounters are well-designed; I didn’t find combat stale till the final hour or so.Alan Wake has its hiccups: certain major characters are entirely uninspired, the combat can be a slog if you don’t keep its nuances in mind at all times, and the story’s end is unfortunately cordoned off by two DLC episodes. The first episode is a drag, while the second episode makes very creative use of old assets, but through both it’s hard to shake the feeling that Wake has overstayed his welcome. This is to say nothing of Alan Wake’s American Nightmare, Remedy’s short standalone follow-up that is honestly better off watched on YouTube for all but the biggest fans of the series. With all of that in mind, the game is well worth playing. Whether your interest is in classic thrillers, campy horror, survival shooters, or just writing in the medium, Alan Wake has something to offer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A must have action thriller for those fans of psychological and eldritch horror. Not a moment gone by without suspense and constant mystery.Pros:-Incredibly rich and detailed world, this is an older title but its eye for detail is out the wazoo-Episodic narrative that really immerses you with fantastic (and slightly tragic) writing-Very challenging gameplay-Creative use of weaponryCons:-Lethargic mobility, and wonky vehicle physics-The game holds you back quite a few times which could get annoying on a 2nd or 3rd playthrough-Lip synching could've been better-The light can be a bit too bright, making it hard to seeA masterfully written and bearing game wrapped within so much mystery that will make you question more well after you've finished it, definitely worth another playthrough (do it on Nightmare, it's not that tough) just to get a full understanding of it all. I really suggest grabbing all of the manuscripts (I mean all of them) so you can really get a sense of how the story developed. The thrill and combat is near constant, with only a few short beautiful vistas to give you a breather, and you'll definitely be grinding teeth now and then until you fully master it all. My tip, conserve your ammunition! Now I understand that Alan isn't exactly an athlete or action hero, but he sometimes moves in a way that is way too slow, taking his time to do his stuff when you're really pressed for time, it shouldn't be that hard to actually SPRINT instead of running just a bit faster for a bit longer, or hurry up with climbing up ladders or getting in and out of vehicles, which takes me to the next point - they're pretty garbage. They're like jello on ice, so be careful when maneuvering the finnicky cars. You'd best leave them alone altogether if they weren't useful for traversing long and sometimes dangerous lengths, so be warned! The game also tends to interrupt your flow by slowing down time to show incoming enemies or pan the camera to locations that are kind of obvious to get to, it's fine on your first playthrough, but gets quite frustrating on your next ones.All in all, besides those gripes, I'd have to say this is one of the best horror games I've played yet, and it shows that a game doesn't have to rely on gore or excessive action to tell a great story and really strike a sense of fear and anxiety in you.Now wake up!

												""He (Nightingale) took out his hip flask when he reached the page that described how he reached the page that made him take out his hip flask.""Alan Wake is a linear third-person psychological survival-horror game set in the fictional setting of Bright Falls. The game is divided into six Episodes and is heavily inspired by mystery TV shows, with Twin Peaks considered a major influence. The game follows our protagonist, Alan Wake, as he tries to uncover and solve the events behind his wife's enigmatic disappearance whilst on vacation to the, seemingly picturesque and calm, town of Bright Falls. Gameplay is fairly simple. The protagonist is armed with a mandatory flashlight and, depending upon availability, an assortment of weapons ranging from a revolver, shotgun, rifle, flare gun, flares and flash grenades. Most of the game takes place in the dark so the flashlight aids in navigating the environment as well as battling the Taken, who are your foes in the darkness. So the flashlight and a weapon of your choice are enough to ward off enemies, which range from blade and chainsaw-wielding foes to poltergeists that throw stuff at you. There are instances when you can drive a car to move around but those segments are completely optional and thus, can be skipped. Ammo is not plentiful so it's up to the player to judge when to take enemies head-on or settle for evasive action. Light is your best friend in the dark. In addition to the usual ammo boxes, fluorescent paint directional cues also lead you to essential supply caches. Exploration rewards you with supplies and also enhances story progression but there's a certain risk involved as foes can jump at you from the dark at any instance. Manuscripts scattered across the environment complement the story and are considered essential towards understanding the intricacies of the plot.Remedy outdid themselves by designing Bright Falls. It's a stunning, albeit grim, town and the attention to detail is amazing. So it comes as a bit of a let-down that the game isn't open-world because Bright Falls is one place that deserves to be explored thoroughly. The story character voice-overs are brilliant and it almost feels like one is watching a mini-TV show. The writing is spectacular; not unexpected for a Sam Lake game. Alan Wake happens to be the most atmospheric game I've played in a long time. The game really pulls you in after the first few episodes. Although missions tend to get tedious because you're forever warding off enemies and/or finding alternate routes to the objective. There are also a few glaring plot holes and characters whose fate was left dangling mid-air. But thankfully, the story is gripping and the presentation and production values are top notch.

												This game is better than it should be and it took me a second to think about it but i will explain the magic of this game. Alan Wake is a B rated thriller movie that you interact with and play, at first i couldnt connect with Alan cause he is a jerk with a very short fuse that causes him to make dumb choices, but then i felt a connection with him when combat starts, I felt cocky much like Alan does when he is well equipped, scared when there are too many enemies to fight and even angry when random objects fly at you.The enemy AI is pretty good too, they will actually try to surround you or some get crazy and will rush you or ram you. Expect alot of ambush cause they specialize in it being shadows and all, the only things that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was the super fast invisible types, it takes too long to flashlight them it can get bad real fast!Same thing with the big guys with big toys and if they show up together you are in for a rough ride.I can recommend this so I will and here is whyGood combatDecent storythriller elementsa little comedyfun and infuriatingenjoy!!

												Alan Wake has some great key people behind it who managed to create a piece of art not just a good game.I really like the strong personality of each character, the way they interact with each other in the game and the way they appear in key moments. Another interesting thing in this game are the radios placed in specific locations and the town's radio host, each time you will spot one, you will want to take a break and hear the local news always related to the odd events around the place and of course listen to some good music. All of these contribute to the strong story.The gameplay is different from most of the 3rd person shooters, a bit unpleasant at first, but addictive later in the game.Graphics are decent, the athmosphere of the game is above many games using hi-end graphics.Alan Wake is the best deal I got so far, for just $1 this game entertained me more than 10hours and it was beyond any expectation!

												Very stylish game with a good story and noir Max-Payne-ish atmosphere included.The Bright Falls is a Silent Hill-ish town with colorful characters, where darkest artists creations come to life.Some of those artists are a fictional metal band Old Gods of Asgard, and the soundtrack by them is just awesome.One con for me probably was that encounters with enemies are mostly similar and can get a bit tiresome.

												Pros:- This game looks amazing even today. At least on the woods. The interiors are not perfect but the whole atmosphere is great.- Smooth controls and great narrative.- Of course if you love Stephen King, Twin Peaks, some cheezy horror movies probably influenced by Mr King like ""In the Mouth of Madness"" etc.. you'll like this.- Is full of easter eggs from many different kind of media.- The difficulty is decent at the beginning, sometimes it gets a bit easy but aside doing some same mechanics over and over they managed from the design to get you interested on  achieving each zone.- Spanish localization available (if you want to recommend this game to someone who likes that)- Is has a greeeeeeeeeatt lenght and is fun to replay! ;)Cons:- Maybe in technical terms some pre-rendered cutscenes and of course the character animations looks decent but sometimes it shows they had too many takes to work on on a consistent level.- That there's not a Remastered Edition (YET! ;) )- Have to wait for Alan Wake 2 (now I understand the hype!) Maybe I have to get the DLC.Thanks Shimi for the recommendation!! :D			",201,41,2,13,2,0,7

***Contains the 2 DLCs ""The Signal"" and ""The Writer""***As always this review is just my own opinion and what I think about this game. If you notice any mistakes I made (apart from grammar mistakes) feel free to report them in the comments.Story:Did you ever read a Stephen King novel in your life? No? Then you should. Yes? Then some aspects of this games story may remind you of his works. The story focuses on writer and husband Alan Wake, who after a severe writer's block decided to leave the bustling city for a long holiday with his wife Alice. Together they visit the small town of Bright Falls, with its old and rural look, including odd townfolk. Telling any more about the story would (in my mind) spoil it for you, just know that things soon take a dark and mysterious turn, all the while letting the player guess about what is really happening until the end. This and the plot twists throughout the game, combined with a storytelling like you would read a good book make for one of the best stories I've ever encountered.Gameplay:Again, actually telling you about the gameplay would spoil some of the story for you, so this will be rather short. The combat system and view is third-person. You get various weapons, like a revolver or a hunting rifle, which you will need to combine with the light of your flashlight to fight off your enemies and make it through each chapter. Darkness and light also play an important role, both story and gameplay wise, since light serves as protection from the dark and even heal Alan. While this system is pretty fun at first, it might get rather boring for you after some time, even though the game gives you new stuff if you progress. For the collectors among you, there are different things to collect, like Coffee Thermoses (ever writers friend) and manuscript pages, which tell part of the story. The levels might sometimes feel repetetive (lots of forests) and linear, but deliver a creepy and rustic atmosphere.Graphics:Alan Wake was made in 2010, but even then the graphics seemed a bit outdated. Some of the textures seem a bit unsharp or muddy. The faces could be a bit more detailed. But what is really impressive is the way the game plays with light effects combined with darkness. Your flashlight, a small light pole in the distance, or even light from a window feel somehow alive and give the player a feeling of safety. The game also runs smoothly and without problems, at least in my experience.Sound:Never in my life would I have thought that a video game would introduce me to a band that I would listen to even years after. Alan Wake did exactly that. The ""Poets of the Fall"", or ""Old Gods of Asgard"" as they are called in-game, are a great and underappreciated Alternative Rock band with a charm like no other. Working together closely with Remedy (Alan Wakes developer), they brought forth songs like ""Children of the Elder God"" or ""The Poet and the Muse, which fit great into the setting and story. On the other hand and more on the soundtrack side is composer Petri Alanko, who captures the atmosphere and feeling of Alan Wake perfectly with his genius tracks.Content:Depending on how much you explore and how fast and skilled you are, the game may take about 10-20 hours, 25-30 for completionists. The two DLCs offer about 2 extra hours each. The game also leaves some manuscript pages unobtainable while playing for the first time, these can only be collected in Nightmare mode. Since the game itsself is rather linear, the time won't strech too far. (I've played through it multiple times though, since its one of my favourites.Multiplayer:None.Conclusion:Alan Wake is a third-person mystery thriller that scores with an incredible story and soundtrack, that captures the hearts of those who play it. Even if some of the graphic features lack in looks and the gameplay is not too special, these things are not what make Alan Wake one of my all-time favourites. A greatly underestimated and overlooked game, which rewards anyone who loves a good story, well written characters and coffee thermoses.For he did not know; That beyond the lake he called home; Lies a deeper, darker ocean green; Where waves are both wilder and more serene. To its ports I've been. ",124,9,0,11,6,0,8

												I only picked up this game when it was on sale for like $4 and took a year or so before I actually got around to playing it.I'm sorry I didn't find out about this game when I came out and that I took so long to play it after buying it, because it's amazing.First of all, it's heavily influenced by a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥that I like, mostly Stephen King, and Twin Peaks. Particularly Stephen King, although other literary references are dropped here and there. The main plot is that you are a deeply troubled writer on vacation with your wife in a quaint mountain town. Pretty quickly you realize that things are going on in this town that are quite strange, the supernatural is afoot, and pretty quickly your wife disappears and you are on the run for your life from the dark, spectral inhabitants of the town. 2SPOOPY4ME!But seriously though, although some of the plot points are a bit cheesy, the core of the story is very good. You spend the whole game fighting dark creatures while traveling through the town, and the whole time, you question whether or not what you're experiencing is ""real"" or Alan Wake descending into insanity. It's a theme the game comes back to quite a bit, which is also indicative of the Stephen King influence.And in the end *SPOILER*after all this questing to retrieve your stolen wife, you end up having to sacrifice yourself to do so, by trapping yourself in the dark world in which she was being held. It ends the game on a really good note in my opinion, because it shows the dedication of Alan Wake's character, and allows him more character building in the American Nightmare storyline and the extra chapters. *END SPOILER*The game is sort of hard, the shooting mechanics are kinda clunky, and enemies can spawn infinitely in sort of areas, meaning if you get trapped in a bad spot, running low on ammo can mean getting stuck in that spot of the game since there are no melee options or non-firearm based attacks.Using light as a resource is a good mechanic, but it's also sort of poorly implemented. Overall, the game has a lot of good ideas but the developers were'nt really sure whether they wanted this to be a shooter or a horror game.The storyline is really good though, and it is a unique experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.

												Alan Wake is an episodic, third person shooter with traces of psychological horror elements at times. I like this game a lot. The episodic format makes it easy to take breaks between play sessions (each ""episode"" even starts with a ""...previously, on Alan Wake""). The graphics are verry pretty and looks like the team really put time and effort in porting the game. Same can be said for the sound effects and the music.Gameplay wise, it's a TPS with an interesting mechanic - the enemies are defeted by first shining a light on them (Alan is using a battery powered flashlight), destroying the ""darkness"" surrounding the enemies and only after that you are able to shoot and destroy them.The part I enjoyed the most was the story - it feels like an actual TV show, but with a great plot and plot twists. It can take a bit of time to chew through all the info you are presented with at times but it all makes sense and leaves you longing for more.All in all, this is a good game and I highly recommend it.

You can also collect 10 alarm clocks, 6 cardboard standees and 10 video games. And I guess you can find out what happened after the main story, but who cares about that when you got collectables.Additions after completing the extra storiesEpisodes 1 and 2 are little additions to the story which may never be finished, since alan wake 2 has once already turned into a different game.My main gripes with the extra stories would probably be that the second chapter used more platforming than I would've been comfortable with, since Alan flails around like a paper bag in the wind at times.They add a couple more collectables as well. And that's about it . . .			",429,86,3,30,24,2,24

												AAA Horror at it's best. Stephen King would be proud. A straightforward Horror-Thriller story combined with some great slick action sequences, this one is a perfectly paced single player experience that is less about freaking the player out and scaring him to death. Rather Alan Wake is an engaging survival horror action game that unlike Resident Evil which in recent installments gradually drifted into the B-Movie style direction always stays true to it's ""mainstream"" AAA Horror roots as defined by the King of Horror himself. Simply put, this is a must play, less scary but nonetheless engaging and thrilling!!			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

It is like an psychological thriller... Enemies' A.I is just good. Controls were very easy for me and I think it would be easy for every casual gamer. The music and the backround voices are respectively with the situation and the level of action. I bought it on Summer Sales 2013 and I think it costed only 2 or 3 €. I think that cost doesn't matter so much because the game is pretty nice. If you don't have money and you really want to buy I sugget to wait for sales.I really enjoyed it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a third person action/thriller game, which eases in the direction of horror without ever completely descending into it. Despite not being released in an episodic format, the game is laid out in a series of ""episodes"" complete with credits and an ending theme which I feel needs to be noted because each one is excellently chosen - I wish all the licensed music could have been on the soundtrack.Combat controls aren't bad, but aren't great - they act to make the game a little more stilted than it otherwise would be, and definitely lends the combat to feel more like padding between cutscenes instead of something interesting into the gameplay itself.The story is more ""unsettling"" than outright creepy/horror, but if you're easily scared it might be best to skip it.Graphics hold up excellently, and the two DLC chapters which follow the original game are.....weird. Good, but weird.All in all, the game is VERY solid, and the atmosphere of the game is incredible. Highly recommended, and I'd also give a nod toward getting the collector's edition so you get the soundtrack, as well. The soundtrack is dissimilar to many game soundtracks in that there are vocal tracks as well, and it's very, very good.Heck, just buy the franchise pack - American Nightmare is even better than the original game (if a tad short), and the combat controls were tightened up to the point where the combat is quite fun.

												   Страх - это чувство, которое может заставить нас совершать немыслимые поступки. Иногда оно делает человека сильнее, иногда, наоборот, превращает в беспомощное создание. Трудно ответить, является ли это состояние сугубо позитивным или негативным. Однако есть люди, для которых внушение страха - всего лишь профессия. Например, писатели ужастиков. Для них страх - средство заработка, однако рано или поздно они становятся рабами этого чувства и вернуть их к нормальной жизни ой как затруднительно.   Так вот, надо круче. Надо, чтобы история развивалась динамичнее. Надо, чтобы ответы были ответами, а не началами вопросов с заделом «на будущее». Надо, чтобы песни, звучащие после окончания каждого эпизода, прилагались отдельным диском, так как их и в машину не грех взять. И все эти «надо» – это лишь от авторской обиды. За то, что хочется ставить высокие оценки, за то, что история Алана Вейка полностью заслуживает того, чтобы с ней ознакомились все.

My ReviewAlan Wake is by far, One of the Absolute best pyschological thrillers I have every played. The lighting, Graphics, Gameplay and Storyline is by far amazing, Hard to understand to begin with, but Also easy to Understand if you listen closely enough. this game has to have one of the most thrilling yet dark storyline I've ever seen. Though, this game can be Difficult at times, I would recommend this game to ANYONE who Wants that one Singleplayer Pyschological Thriller to sit down and Enjoy.The StorySupposedly Spoilers But ONLY from the Start. Read at own Risk!This game has one, very, very simple rule, trust Noone in the dark. The story takes place in Bright Falls as a vacation for a Writer famously known as Alan Wake to get away from editing and to cool off with the love of his life Alice. Upon his stay at Bright Falls he discovers that something about the town is really wrong and that it was dangerous to travel at night. the darkness he stumbled upon takes Alice, Wake, not knowing whether or not Alice is Alive or Hostage, persues the Darkness that stole Alice from him. upon his journey, he discovers fragments from a draft book he hadn't even writen, The book was titled ""Departure, by Alan Wake."" Supposedly telling him the chapters of his own story and leading him to the of them. Join wake as the darkness pushes you too the brink of insanity to unravel the anwser he desperatly hungers to know. ""Where is Alice?""Awesome music video based in Alan Wake's Universe

												Alan Wake is a third person action/thriller game, which eases in the direction of horror without ever completely descending into it. Despite not being released in an episodic format, the game is laid out in a series of ""episodes"" complete with credits and an ending theme which I feel needs to be noted because each one is excellently chosen - I wish all the licensed music could have been on the soundtrack.Combat controls aren't bad, but aren't great - they act to make the game a little more stilted than it otherwise would be, and definitely lends the combat to feel more like padding between cutscenes instead of something interesting into the gameplay itself.The story is more ""unsettling"" than outright creepy/horror, but if you're easily scared it might be best to skip it.Graphics hold up excellently, and the two DLC chapters which follow the original game are.....weird. Good, but weird.All in all, the game is VERY solid, and the atmosphere of the game is incredible. Highly recommended, and I'd also give a nod toward getting the collector's edition so you get the soundtrack, as well. The soundtrack is dissimilar to many game soundtracks in that there are vocal tracks as well, and it's very, very good.Heck, just buy the franchise pack - American Nightmare is even better than the original game (if a tad short), and the combat controls were tightened up to the point where the combat is quite fun.

The story is extremely well done, and the atmosphere and world building are amazing.2. The combat system is rather novel. I, personally, haven't seen this type of combat in any other game. You must manage the use both types of weapons that you have in order to defeat each enemy. The flashlight to remove the ""darkness"" shield, and the gun to actually kill the guy. Each type of weapon has a different type of ammo to manage as well.Every time I go back and play this game I get nostagic. It has remained my favorite game since it first came out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The six missions begin and end as true-to-form episodic television, with ""Previously on Alan Wake..."" intro montages and cliffhanger endings, not to mention the great soundtrack to add authenticity. Graphics are remarkably mint (demonstrating the power of a good console port). Writing, pacing and plotlines are superb, albeit a tad predictable for anyone vaguely familiar with Stephen Kings works but none the less remain captivating, dark and edgey. There are no groundbreaking concepts in tow- the game creators seemingly show respect to the adage of not fixing that which is not broke, and the game is better for it.In a vague nutshell, you spend much of the time talking in soliloquy, trying to find your missing wife, while ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants as you flee from axe wielding men hellbent on killing you, in a dark forest, with limited weapons/ammo and only a torch to keep them at bay. And every moment is a terrifying hoot.A video game, a horror novel and a tv show. Alan Wake is all of these.8/10 ",62,5,1,1,5,0,5

												This is one of those games that make wish there was a neutral option.The premise, story, characters, setting - they're all great.  Graphics aren't bad either, especially for a non-cartoony six-year-old game.  But the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired - the controls are clunky, the game is extremely linear and filled with one-way drops and doors, there's not much diversity in enemies or weapons, and most of game consists of hiking through the woods.So, buy it if it's on sale.  Enjoy it for the flawed gem that it is and the classic that it could have been.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Steven King gets his own video game!!!! No, not really, actually the story told by this game is a lot better than much of the recent releases by King, but he does get a reference or two in the game. All in all the setting is spot on, the fighting style can get a bit repetitive (shine light to remove immunity, shoot weapon), but they give you enough options to keep it interesting. Not to mention this game doesn't work well with bad accuracy. Your character is extremely squishy and can often get put into a stun lock when there are multiple enemies around, so some strategy is required for the pacing of which enemies you kill/stun and when. Range is your best friend in the game - second only to light, and while the game doesn't have any ""cover"" mechanics, if you are clever you can make your own. Ammo conservation is a major aspect of the game, but minimalists can still finish out an act with a stockpile of ammo. All in all, I'd say 9/10. Wake is a fantastic character, thrown into chaos; he goes with the flow with a sense of natural disbelief. If he weren't so driven to save his wife, he would go batshit crazy extremely early in the story. Even the semi-comic relief character Barry has a nice balance of annoyance and ""this guy could really possibly be my best friend"", all the while surprisingly making you hope he doesn't get killed the whole way through. With nods to various classic psycho-horror icons like ""The Twilight Zone"" in the games very own ""Night Springs"" show, Alan Wake also makes the world very believable, which helps to really set the mood. If you haven't played the game yet, and you aren't sitting on a giant vertical stick about gameplay, then you should really check out this game! ",213,57,2,21,21,2,19

												Alan Wake is one of my all time favorite games.  This thriller is a step up from Quantic Dreams and their games like Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls in the sense of making an enjoyable story whilst keeping the video game experience intact.  The Goods:  The story is incredible with many twists and character development.  The gaming UI is minimalistic yet helpful, and you can turn it off and still enjoy the game (see my guide to know how.)  The variety of enemies keeps the game challenging.  The graphics look good for the time it was made, however the setting of most of the maps has a lot of taxing fog on your machine.  A dodge mechanic is very satisfying to get out of the way of a flying axe.  The Not-So-Goods:  The combat can be a bit repetitiive and overwhelming at times, with many taken ganging up on you.  The game has manuscript pages are taxing to collect and kill the narritive.  While the game has some Story DLC, it seems a bit like an extended universe to compensate for the short yet slow main story experience.I give this game a 7/10.  The story is incredible, the graphics are good yet taxing, and the AI are a bit lacking in terms of the swarm mechanic they seem to develop, yet the gameplay mechanics cancel it out.

												I would like to recommend Alan Wake to anyone who likes a great story. To my surprise it went far beyond the rubber reality ""What is real?"" theme.While it has no branching storyline, Remedy used the linearity to tell a tight but multilayered story with a lot of allusions to itself, books, movies, Max Payne etc.The gameplay itself is pretty repetitive but smooth and fun.It all revolves around light - flashlights, flares, flashbangs, electricity, lightbulbs etc. - that you need to use to make the Taken vulnerable to physical weapons / control the crowd / buy a few seconds to take a breath and reload. The gameplay quite stands out itself from other shooters. The best about this game is the story and the very much optional allusions and details that you have to actively hunt, like radio and TV shows, optional dialogues, manuscript pages etc. The music is also great, always used to add a nice touch to the story.10/10 ",310,62,8,27,25,2,21

												Несмотря на то что сей шедевр вышел достаточно давно,я думаю что обзор всё равно будет к месту :jRemedy Entertainment(студия, создавшая в прошлом такие игры как Max Payne и Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, являющиеся 100% классикой)  удалось создать не просто игру, а самый настоящий психологический триллер с потрясающим сюжетом и атмосферой, в мир которой хочется окунуться снова и снова. Игра повествует нам о писателе Алане Уэйке, посетившем местный городок под названием Брайт-Фоллс со своей подругой Элис, где он становится свидетелем  сверъхестественных сил,в результате проявления которых его подруга внезапно пропадает и постепенно в наш мир начинают попадать персонажи из рукописей Алана,оживленные темной сущностью, которая была выпущена давным-давно другим писателем,жившем в утонувшем доме...Aтмосфера detected.Помимо атмосферы и сюжета  данное творение может похвастаться отменными воссозданными персонажами. Удался как главный герой(который был взят с реально существующего финского писателя), так и второстепенные персонажи. Взять хотя бы Барри, друга главного героя или братьев Тора и Одина Андерсон, создателей группы The Old Gods of Asgard :)Сам  геймплей получился весьма ""необычным"", в хорошем смысле слова. По-настоящему его можно оценить на уровне сложности кошмар. Попробуйте, вам обязательно понравится :DТакже здесь  довольно приятная графика и отличное звуковое сопровождение. Удались многочисленные пейзажи местной глубинки.Я не припомню другой игры, где есть такой сюжет и атмосфера.Оценка: 9.5 из 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was an incredibly immersive game.  The story, characters and dialogue were all quite good.  The settings were very well-realized and contributed a lot to the atmosphere and spookiness of the game.  The music was also quite effective.The gameplay is not the greatest with the controls feeling a little clunky at times and some sections near the end of the game seeming repetitive.  I found the difficulty pretty rough and restarted the game at the easiest setting which was a good decision as I never got stuck on any part for too long once I restarted.Overall an enjoyable experience which was very memorable.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story set in a convincing world.			",142,28,1,24,12,1,55

												I would like to recommend Alan Wake to anyone who likes a great story. To my surprise it went far beyond the rubber reality ""What is real?"" theme.While it has no branching storyline, Remedy used the linearity to tell a tight but multilayered story with a lot of allusions to itself, books, movies, Max Payne etc.The gameplay itself is pretty repetitive but smooth and fun.It all revolves around light - flashlights, flares, flashbangs, electricity, lightbulbs etc. - that you need to use to make the Taken vulnerable to physical weapons / control the crowd / buy a few seconds to take a breath and reload. The gameplay quite stands out itself from other shooters. The best about this game is the story and the very much optional allusions and details that you have to actively hunt, like radio and TV shows, optional dialogues, manuscript pages etc. The music is also great, always used to add a nice touch to the story.10/10 ",310,62,8,27,25,2,21

												Suddenly, out of nowhere, the entire sky slowly turned gold. Everyone looked up from the ground. Hard lightning striked from above, and thunder errupted like an enourmous volcano. A golden figure came floating down from above into the middle of the field. He looked like a 60 year old male. He had white hair and was wearing a gold shirt with gold pants. He helt a walking cane with a small trophy statue erected on the top, along with the words ""YOU'RE WINNER"" just written below it. He worn black sunglazzes, keeping people from seeing his eyes. Suddenly, 4 large rigs carrying illegal cargo came floating down from above, along with Shaquille O'Neal, Superman, Barney, CATS, Michael Jackson, E.T., and an N-Gage. ",116,16,8,14,4,0,2

Alan Wake ReviewThird person atmospheric horror game with a major flaw.Alan Wake is a third person atmospheric game from Remedy Entertainment. I will start off by saying that although this game is good, it is certainly overrated by a long milestone. The game really looks like it's going to build up to something. It doesn't. That is the major flaw. The storyline doesn't make sense and the ending is disappointing and confusing. Yes, there is another game in the franchise, ""Alan Wake's American Nightmare"" that takes place a couple of years after the events of this game. But even that game doesn't explain what actually happened.The game is fun. The shooting is awesome and the mechanics feel really nice. Using a torch as a weapon felt awesome to me. The hidden traps and puddles of darkness were a nice touch. The enemies were never too difficult, but always a little bit challenging. At one point there is a shootout on a stage and Barry activates a bunch of fireworks and there's music playing and it's just fantastic. The characters in the game are pretty good, the voice acting, too. The driving in this game is appauling. This game and Just Cause 2 are the worst games for driving vehicles in my opinion.It's just that I don't know what Alan Wake tried to be. Did it try to be a horror game or an atmospheric game or a shooter game or an interactive movie? I mean, I just think Remedy decided ""Let's make a horror game. But I want to make an action game too. And maybe an adventure game as well. Hey! Let's just jumble them all up together!""The game is good. Yes, I do recommend it. I would try to get it for a cheaper price. Maybe get it during Steam sales or purchase it elsewhere.			",338,91,18,24,36,3,29

												Несмотря на то что сей шедевр вышел достаточно давно,я думаю что обзор всё равно будет к месту :jRemedy Entertainment(студия, создавшая в прошлом такие игры как Max Payne и Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, являющиеся 100% классикой)  удалось создать не просто игру, а самый настоящий психологический триллер с потрясающим сюжетом и атмосферой, в мир которой хочется окунуться снова и снова. Игра повествует нам о писателе Алане Уэйке, посетившем местный городок под названием Брайт-Фоллс со своей подругой Элис, где он становится свидетелем  сверъхестественных сил,в результате проявления которых его подруга внезапно пропадает и постепенно в наш мир начинают попадать персонажи из рукописей Алана,оживленные темной сущностью, которая была выпущена давным-давно другим писателем,жившем в утонувшем доме...Aтмосфера detected.Помимо атмосферы и сюжета  данное творение может похвастаться отменными воссозданными персонажами. Удался как главный герой(который был взят с реально существующего финского писателя), так и второстепенные персонажи. Взять хотя бы Барри, друга главного героя или братьев Тора и Одина Андерсон, создателей группы The Old Gods of Asgard :)Сам  геймплей получился весьма ""необычным"", в хорошем смысле слова. По-настоящему его можно оценить на уровне сложности кошмар. Попробуйте, вам обязательно понравится :DТакже здесь  довольно приятная графика и отличное звуковое сопровождение. Удались многочисленные пейзажи местной глубинки.Я не припомню другой игры, где есть такой сюжет и атмосфера.Оценка: 9.5 из 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Steven King gets his own video game!!!! No, not really, actually the story told by this game is a lot better than much of the recent releases by King, but he does get a reference or two in the game. All in all the setting is spot on, the fighting style can get a bit repetitive (shine light to remove immunity, shoot weapon), but they give you enough options to keep it interesting. Not to mention this game doesn't work well with bad accuracy. Your character is extremely squishy and can often get put into a stun lock when there are multiple enemies around, so some strategy is required for the pacing of which enemies you kill/stun and when. Range is your best friend in the game - second only to light, and while the game doesn't have any ""cover"" mechanics, if you are clever you can make your own. Ammo conservation is a major aspect of the game, but minimalists can still finish out an act with a stockpile of ammo. All in all, I'd say 9/10. Wake is a fantastic character, thrown into chaos; he goes with the flow with a sense of natural disbelief. If he weren't so driven to save his wife, he would go batshit crazy extremely early in the story. Even the semi-comic relief character Barry has a nice balance of annoyance and ""this guy could really possibly be my best friend"", all the while surprisingly making you hope he doesn't get killed the whole way through. With nods to various classic psycho-horror icons like ""The Twilight Zone"" in the games very own ""Night Springs"" show, Alan Wake also makes the world very believable, which helps to really set the mood. If you haven't played the game yet, and you aren't sitting on a giant vertical stick about gameplay, then you should really check out this game! ",213,57,2,21,21,2,19

												Alan Wake is one of my all time favorite games.  This thriller is a step up from Quantic Dreams and their games like Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls in the sense of making an enjoyable story whilst keeping the video game experience intact.  The Goods:  The story is incredible with many twists and character development.  The gaming UI is minimalistic yet helpful, and you can turn it off and still enjoy the game (see my guide to know how.)  The variety of enemies keeps the game challenging.  The graphics look good for the time it was made, however the setting of most of the maps has a lot of taxing fog on your machine.  A dodge mechanic is very satisfying to get out of the way of a flying axe.  The Not-So-Goods:  The combat can be a bit repetitiive and overwhelming at times, with many taken ganging up on you.  The game has manuscript pages are taxing to collect and kill the narritive.  While the game has some Story DLC, it seems a bit like an extended universe to compensate for the short yet slow main story experience.I give this game a 7/10.  The story is incredible, the graphics are good yet taxing, and the AI are a bit lacking in terms of the swarm mechanic they seem to develop, yet the gameplay mechanics cancel it out.

												Alan Wake is the video game embodiment of the B horror genre. Awful acting? Check. Laughable plot? Check. Low production values? At times (though the final quarter of the game is pretty impressive.) In spite of all this, or perhaps because of it, the game is a surprisingly charming gem for the genre.My only real complaint with the game is how the designers chose to constantly revoke your stockpile of weapons at every turn, instead of taking the time to balance progression properly. At each act, and sometimes more often that that, you're stripped of all the weapons, ammo, and upgrades you've acquired and have to start fresh. Not a deal breaker, but lazy from a design standpoint, and annoying after 6 episodes. All in all though this isn't a big deal, and doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game.

												This was a hard review to write.This game is one of my favorite's when it comes to story and voice acting. It's interesting, intense, has an amazing sense of humor, and some of the best side characters of all time. The atmosphere when you begin to find pages is wonderful, as you read about Alan being attacked by an axe murderer just before you're jumped- a classic, but fabulous thriller trick.However, at the same time, it was one of my least favorites. Though exploration and early level gameplay is entertaining, the level design starts repeating, until you hit the final chapter which is the worst level design I've ever played. There are some gems in the gameplay, such as the Anderson Farm and the Heart of Darkness- but the gameplay of the game suffers enormously from controls that just seem off.However, as I said before, this story is one that needs to be told. My personal recommendation is to either watch a youtube game movie of it, or to pick up the game if it's on a major sale. You need to hear this story, but you don't need to play the game.Overall, even with these enormous game flaws, I left the game feeling satisfied- I'd give the game a 6/10, and I'd give the story a 9/10. I wish the developers were given the chance to give this game the sequel it so obviously needs and deserves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They attempted to market this one as a ""psychological action thriller"", but make no mistake...this is a HORROR game, and one of the highest calibre at that.  Not the ""scariest"" of its kind, perhaps, but that aside this is absolutely top-notch in every conceivable department - story, gameplay, graphics, sound - you name it.     It even has that rarest of horror game features...ally A.I. which actually WORKS!  No ""babysitting"" an annoying NPC who stands in your way three-quarters of the time, or hovers idiotically between you and the enemy you're attempting to kill...these ones fight competently alongside you, without ""carrying"" you to the point where you can just stand back and let them do all the dirty work.    This game also manages to be quite ""long"" without overstaying its welcome; another rare feat, at least in my estimation.  It's so good, in fact, that it's even worth the full thirty - count 'em, thirty - dollars still being standardly asked on Steam, but really...we all just wait for the sales on anything which isn't brand spanking new and/or under ten dollars anyway, don't we?  I do, but then again, I am a bit of a cheapskate.     Expect a review of the sequel soon, kids...Verdict: 10/10.			",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												""Alan Wake"" is talently written and well-directed, voice acting is remarkable, music..., well everything it quiet noteworthy about this game, except the gameplay. If you found Bioshock Infinite's gameplay shallow, Wake got a surprise for you and it's a bad one. First of all port is poor, partly cause of this gunplay just is not enjoyable and pretty boring, gladly late in the game I realize that I could just run to other checkpoint leaving flairs and enemies behind, when it's possible.  It brings to another sad thing. You could find all pages of manuscript that contain parts of the story only on the nightmare game difficulty. Believe me after you beat it on normal, which is not a cakewalk as well, you won’t want to go through all this again. Back to the good part. Nevertheless game brings to you really great atmosphere and story, most of reviews compare it to Steven King's novels and you really can feel that writers drew their inspiration there. But for me it all reminds ""circus"" level from Max Payne 2: dark, gloomy, depressive, hallucinogenic and crazy. Some names, situations, etc. insinuate to Max as well, you could even see his face on TV if you got a watchful eye. Drama in Max Payne is stronger, but more obvious and schematic, while Wake's writers create truly holywoodish (in a good way) suspense, narrative full of metaphors and links to pop-culture. It could be a fantastic movie, but it's just a good game worth your time.			",695,247,14,63,59,10,79

												An action-horror game with great atmosphere, audio, and decent enough story to keep you going. Very well done and polished. It gets cheap on sales so I'd say it is a must-have for all those who enjoy horror-like games (albeit Alan Wake isn't that scary, especially since the action is too fast-paced for that, but it hold an unsettling feeling) and many others who just enjoy action games. I liked it a lot. The only drawbacks are too much action (if you are more into horror part than action) and rather silly enemies, which are ghosts. Nonetheless, it is well worth the money and the time.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												At first I was kind of thinking this would be just another generic horror game, but I found Alan Wake to be a very pleasant surprise indeed. While the gameplay itself is nothing revolutionary, the way the game flows and this game's story is where it really shines.There is definitely a lot of suspense and mystery in this game and it has its moments of horror as well (albeit its more suprise rather than shock-value horror). Is it an ultra scary/super gory game? No, but its unique narrative and flow don't need it to give you reservations about turning the lights off. If the game doesn't grab you in the beginning, keep going and give it a bit of time to do so and the game will suck you in. When I first started playing, I almost jumped to the wrong conclusion about the game, but after giving it some time and playing it more and more, it sucked me into it and kept me on the edge of my seat to see what happens next.Overall, I would say this game is worth the purchase/playthrough and I fully recommend it. Although I can't say that this game has replay value (outside of running achievements and collectables), its definitely worth the initial playthrough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a chicken when it comes to scary video games, so i was worried that i wouldn't even play this game when i bought it in the steam sales. At first i disabled the sound and played with music, but after a while i jumped through that fear and had to turn on the sound. I'll explain why.A very good story, very immersive, that kind of story that keeps you glued to the screen, it's rare these days.A refreshing gameplay. You'll find a simple flashlight more useful than a shotgun in the game and it has some simple puzzles too. It gets a bit repetitive though. Go from here, to there, now there, now go back, now there again... but the story compensates for it.The graphics are amazing, period!The sound fits 100% in this kind of game. You always get the feeling that you really are in the dark and that you will eventually be attacked by surprise.There are some collectibles you can get. If you get them all in the first playthrough, nice. If you don't, i don't think the game makes much effort for you to play it again and grab them.7.5/10 ",115,5,10,9,10,2,16

												This is not a ""survival horror."" Not even a ""terror"" game. There are no scares, unless you are afraid of the dark, and there's no terror unless you hate Stephen King books.This is an action game with a supernatural component, an interesting (but simple) kill mechanic (use the flashlight to ""light"" the enemies, shoot them) and a bloody great told story, which jumps straight into the simple and fun Stephen King style and emerges with a really fun (and light) tale about dark beings, a missing wife and a forgotten writer.This game is made by the same guys who did Max Payne, and it is written in the same, dense, metaphor heavy style. If you liked Max's monologues in the original Max Paynes (1 and 2), you will love Alan Wake's adventure. There are a huge load of references to the original Max Payne, there are references to the nordic mythology (Together with one of the best moments in the game), there are a really good radio broadcast and a really interesting ""Night Springs"" TV show (both of them continuously referencing what's going on in the game)... all together band up to create a great atmosphere, and to make Bright Springs (The semi incomunicated US village in which the game takes place) a live place, with lot of interesting characters and really well written dialogues, without getting too complex or too boring to hear.The bad part is that gameplay wise the game is a bit repetitive: Light (let's calle them) dark zombie with flashlight, shoot, repeat. There are not too much different enemies but at least there are several different weapons to kill them, and, to be honest, the action feels right for the game: Just a good bang bang bang without too many options, but still, enjoyable.I can (and will) criticize the lack of variety in the game: Its like a game coming from 2004-2007 with its linear paths, its waves after waves of ""dark zombies"", a little bit of exploration and some ""hold the fort"" moments. Really fun, but nothing we haven't seen before. One could think that, with a mechanic as cool as being able to ""play"" with lights and shadows, the developers could have done something more interesting than just using as a mechanism to ""aim"" to the ""dark zombies"" and preventing the player to go all ""rock 'n roll"" with the big hordes.Still, the storytelling blends really well with the shooting sections: It does not distract the player when he is playing in the same way that the gameplay does not distract the player when the game is telling him part of the story, and this is something lot of developers should learn.In short, Alan Wake is an average-but-fun horror themed shooted with a really nicely told story. It does not do anything new, or innovative, but what it does, it does it quite right.So, yeah, thumbs up.			",327,90,5,30,22,3,49

												Fantastic game. Superb writting is involved (story, characters, events) and the game stands out because of it. Game is organised in episodes and playing feels like watching a good thriller/horror/action tv show, where after watching the episode you just can't wait for next one to begin. This game has some unique mechanics features like using flashlight to fight your opponents and cinematic evading of attacks (something like Bullet Time from Max Payne, but done different).I will say nothing more (I could spoil something which would be better if you discover it yourself), I'll just say that everything in this game is done with great detail and this is probably one of the best games in its genre, so be sure to check it out.

												Imagine if your wife disappears on your vacation,and you keep finding pages of a story you never wrote...that happens in Alan Wake,a best selling writer.The first thing that made me buy this game was the story,and since Remedy Entertainment was working with Rockstar in making of Max Payne,I knew that this game was going to be great.The whole gameplay is awesome.You find batteries which you need to fight of the Taken,which can only be harmed when you destroy their darkness with light,and blow them into pieces.The graphic are very good,and the scenery also great.When I entered a store in town,I bought The Collectors Edition,so I got the soundtrack cd,which is great,a poster,postcards from Bright Falls(the place in the game).For 28 euros,you buy an awesome game,I agree its too much ,but its WORTH IT!

												Engrossing mystery thriller with unfortunate gameplay weaknesses.Alan Wake is an immersive experience filled with mystery. Its greatest strength is definitely its plot. It captures its audience by presenting an interesting premise and questions that need answers, which ends up being the main driving force of the game. It did a fantastic job of keeping me interested throughout the game. The story is complemented by (mostly) well written dialogue and some (not all) well constructed characters. The issue I have with the plot is its ending, which contains no real closure or catharsis, which I imagine is due to a possible sequel. Another strength is the atmosphere. The dark tone of the game is achieved by a meticulous attention to lighting and a carefully picked soundtrack. It all blends together to form a dark engrossing mystery.Unfortunately the gameplay is its greatest weakness. It is thrilling and exciting at first, but quickly turns into a tedious routine that just stops you from exploring the storyline. The formula never changes: shoot the ""taken"" with light, then shoot them with weapons, rinse and repeat. The game does try to add some variety by adding elements of platforming, puzzles and even the illusion of exploration. Gameplay is in and of itself not bad. The problem with it is that the gameplay sections are too long. They're so long that whatever fun you had killing the taken dissapates very quickly. This is unfortunate, because I believe if those sections were made shorter, the game would feel a lot more immersive and connected.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright, I got a lot to say about this one because it really just baffles me.I don't understand how people forgive Alan Wake for all the glaring issues it has. I guess I can give it credit for trying to be unique, but underneath that... it tries to do a lot of things but fails to do them well. The only redeeming qualities for me are the visuals, sound and atmosphere. The facial animations really haven't aged well though; too often descending into uncanny valley territory.The combat is just frustrating and tedious. Most of the difficulty seems to be movement, positioning, timing, and to a lesser extent resource management based. It isn't really that hard, just strict when it comes to mistakes. Most importantly though, it just never feels fun, satisfying, or engaging.The light mechanic only serves to take control of the pace of battle away from the player, meaning most of the time you're just sitting around waiting for things to be vulnerable so you can shoot them. Everything has to be time consuming.Speaking of pace, almost every time enemies spawn the game goes into a slow-motion cutscene. This really takes away from the horror aspect of the game (if you can even call it a horror game, or a game at all) when you know nothing can ever really get the drop on you.And speaking of enemies, there are only about three or four of them. The way the game amps up the challenge is by just throwing larger amounts of them at you as you progress. There are no real boss fights either, unless you count utility vehicles and inanimate objects coming to life or ""defend this position"" segments.When you do have to run, Alan can only sprint for a measly few seconds before he has an asthma attack. There's also a dodge mechanic that's tied to your sprint key, which is unreliable and only works half of the time.Nothing about the story or characters intrigues me. I really don't see it as the massive step in video game narrative that everyone else does, it just takes itself too seriously and comes across as campy and pretentious. I'm sick of games trying to prove themeselves as a relevant artform when they don't need to, they always have been. Stop trying to make them like TV shows or movies, let them be their own thing.The plot is that you're a best-selling novel writer whose cliché horror story is becoming true, yet it takes the majority of the game to establish this point even though it's obvious from the very start. Also, your wife is missing, because of course she is.Alan narrates everything you do, and his voice is just... weird. Awkward. I don't think it's so much an issue with the voice acting as it is the audio equipment used, it really doesn't sound right.Characters constantly reference other, better horror stories and authors that remind me that I could be doing something better with my time.There are long segments where you just follow someone around while they repeatedly tell Alan he's crazy. When I'm playing these segments I just want to get to the game segments. When I'm playing the game segments I just want the level to be over. It's a cycle of constant boredom.The game is structured like an episodic miniseries. I really don't get why some games do this whole ""Previously, on >insert show here<"" rubbish, it's just really tacky to me. I don't even like it when TV shows do it so why the hell would it work in a game?The only thing to keep you going is the hope that there's some sort of payoff or revelation at the end.*Yawn*Oh yeah, and there's product placement. Yup. Buy Energizer! Their batteries last for a staggering five seconds!The irony is Alan Wake would probably make a better TV show, or hell, even a novel. But the way I see it there is just no sense slogging your way through this game for what it offers. It doesn't hold my attention at all. Then again, I'm of a small minority, and many people will just downvote me. So who knows, maybe everyone played a different game to me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I recommend watching someone else play it before buying.Good night, don't let the spooky shadow people bite.

												A severely underrated game in every respect.I had initially purchased the game on the 360 when it was still an exclusive and spent hours upon hours playing and replaying the game. The rich and detailed world, and the startling and beautiful atmosphere left me wanting more at every turn. This game is the prophetic flagship of storytelling in video games - and should set the gold standard as time moves on. The gameplay is simple, fast paced and tense - adrenaline fueled, sometimes challenging and always fair. The story will keep you invested long after you lean back idly in your chair to contemplate the unfolding narrative, and the dramatic set-pieces tie the game together into a beautiful package you'd regret missing. The soundtrack is a pure, undisputed work of art, and is included should you pick up the collector's edition extras; worth every penny. You should be playing this game right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very competent shooter with robust mechanics and enough weapon verity to make the action fun and fluid. Not only this but the unique mechanic of Light is super fun and innovative and adds another level to an already great game. The story, characters, antagonist and setting are fantastic, rich and engrossing and you will not find yourself bored for one minute.I loved this game from start to finish, even playing it and the DLC’s through to completion twice in a row. I recommend this any day of the week. If you liked any of Revolvers previous games, Max Payne, then this will be right up your alley. Do not miss this one.Have fun ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												Atmosphere... it's just great.It sucks you in right away. It feels like you're really in a horror story and you feel the tension almost all the time. Listening to a radio show or a TV show or when there is a day outside is like a moments of relief. Never thought a flashlight could be your greatest weapon... well, except for flashbang grenades, which, i think, are little overpowered, because you can kill almost every taken in your sight with one grenade. And those grenades aren't very rare.Last mission felt a bit too long and shallow - just fighting your way trough hordes of taken and angry cars, boats and other trash.Definitely will play one more time on nightmare difficulty to collect all the manuscript pages and other collectibles that aren't available on easier difficulties.Great and, in my opinion, unique game - 9/10			",197,35,10,29,14,2,40

												Heavily story driven third person shooter game that plays like some interactive episodic horror series.Not that scary tho' - often creepy as heck, the forest by night.. But you feel quite empowered with your flashlight and assortment of guns so there's no time for scary moments, just shooting. Those scare jumps? Killed right off the bet. And more enemies at once? Well that sometimes sadly felt more like fighting with controls as opposed to with enemies, so more annoying than scary. Maybe excluding moments when the only recourse was to run to a safe haven, but it was never obvious.Except near the end of second special episode, now there's a scary part.I realized how dependant have I become on minimaps, getting lost in the woods. But in the end indicator where to go is really all you need, except if you want to wander around for hidden bonuses, then it's time to actually pay attention to your surroundings not to get lost.But story, story, it's really great.

												Highly recommended, as long as you have a controller. The first few times I gave this game a shot, I insisted on using the mouse and keyboard, but the more you play, the more you realize the combat moments in this game aren't about precision, but more about crowd control. The story itself is highly original, which I don't want to delve too much into for fear of spoiling part of the adventure. What I will say is that, since the game is broken up into episodes with distinct ending points, and each episode taking about 2 hours to complete, it gives you some very easy moments to stop and return to the game later. The graphics still hold up incredibly well, the sound design is phenomenal, the voice acting does a great job of making you long to hear more, or occasionally sending chills down your spine as you run through a dark forrest, listening to the constant dark presence approaching behind you, with enemies snarling sinister sounding dialogue and chasing you down with the sole intent to kill you.Worth a buy, I definitely had a lot of fun with this one. AND it includes the two DLC episodes that were released on 360 for free!			",658,103,20,47,53,8,68

												Between this game and Alan Wake's American Nightmare, I had so much fun playing these games. Between a deep, compelling story, some hilarious moments, a good soundtrack (I've come to find myself listening to the soundtrack to this and the sequel in my spare time), and just an all around fun game, I fell in love. Someone recommended this game to me saying ""it's a game where you point flashlights at monsters and they die."" Let me tell you now, as fun as the light mechanic in this game is, there is so much more going for this game. Buy it ASAP.Just let me point out though. I got this during the Christmas sale, for $4 for the complete edition. I personally don't think this game is worth $40 (I don't think any game is worth $40), but I recommend it all the same.

												Alan Wake is a masterpiece to put it short and sweet, and is one of those rare few gems that make the PC gaming genre enjoyable... It's constant on-edge tension and fast-paced combat coupled with a well thought of plot is what makes it really stand out from the watered out titles. At times it gets to a point where you'd like ""I can't do this anymore"" as some scenes can get really hectic, but where there is a light there is a way, and that is what makes it so much fun and makes me keep coming back for more each and every time!

												This game is an underated gem in the survial horror genreYou play as Alan Wake, a writter looking for his missing wife in a sleepy woodland town thats being taken over by living darkness.  What this game does best is presentaion and atmosphere.  The levels are gorgeous during the day and spooky during the night and you'll find your self jumping at shadows and curising the sound of the wind.  The story is presented as if you were in a living book with Alan narrating the events and objectives as you play.  Things start to get really intresting when you begin finding pages to a manuscript that you have no memory writing and that describe things you have no way of know or even things that have yet to occur.  Top that off with amazing sound design and a kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack and i've never been so emersed in a game before.The games main short coming is combat.  To kill enemies you have to shine a flashlight on them until they become vunerable before shooting them. and thats it.  And theres only about 4 or 5 enemy types in the whole game so combat becomes samey real fast.  they do try to mix things up every now and then by throwing you into ambushes where you have to fend of multipule waves of enemies at a disadvatge or giving you a driving segmant here and there.  At least the controls are solid so combat doesn't feel frustrating.  There are also little hidden story elements and item cashes hidden through out the enviroments like radio boradcasts or episodes of a strange show similar to outer limits or twilight zone. this adds a bit of exploration to the leves and gives at least a little replay value.  This isn't a perfect game but its one that you really should play if you want a solid story and great atomsphere.			",224,104,1,29,12,2,44

												Very mixed feelings about Alan Wake. The story was brilliant and intriguing, and for the time the gameplay was very inventive. The pages you find around the game are genuinly interesting which makes you actively look for them. However I quickly thought the gun combat was very tedious and often quite predictable, and I found myself pushing through that just to find out more about the story; this was true for many aspects of the game for me. There are a few puzzles a long the way but I never found myself stuck on any of them for long.I would recommend this game purely on the captivating story, but prepare for a grind; whether intentional or not.7/10			",64,7,0,9,4,0,7

												Alan Wake started great. The story was interesting and the characters were cool. But it was annoying as hell to fight against flying chairs?? and cars and boxes and frigdes.... This was a pretty story driven game, but I think the combat was too arkward. Mostly it is the same pattern, flashlight on and shooting.			",213,66,3,40,7,1,26

												This game is a relief from all the cliche horror with jump scares or cheap death that we all are getting nowadays. I know it's an old game and I just got to play it recently. The game introduces a novel writer as your protagonist with a flashlight and a handy revolver to subdue your enemy. It may feel a bit bland but sometimes what is plain simple and bland is the most effective.Storyline wise , it was perfect, finishing chapter after chapter has never felt so satisfying as playing Alan Wake. It has good suspense and leave you at cliffhanger everytime you finish a chapter, which makes you wanna continue playing the game and find out what happens next.  Gameplay wise is good, no problem with me so far and the controls are easy to master.9/10 would wake Alan again.			",81,12,0,8,4,1,6

												Highly recommended, as long as you have a controller. The first few times I gave this game a shot, I insisted on using the mouse and keyboard, but the more you play, the more you realize the combat moments in this game aren't about precision, but more about crowd control. The story itself is highly original, which I don't want to delve too much into for fear of spoiling part of the adventure. What I will say is that, since the game is broken up into episodes with distinct ending points, and each episode taking about 2 hours to complete, it gives you some very easy moments to stop and return to the game later. The graphics still hold up incredibly well, the sound design is phenomenal, the voice acting does a great job of making you long to hear more, or occasionally sending chills down your spine as you run through a dark forrest, listening to the constant dark presence approaching behind you, with enemies snarling sinister sounding dialogue and chasing you down with the sole intent to kill you.Worth a buy, I definitely had a lot of fun with this one. AND it includes the two DLC episodes that were released on 360 for free!			",658,103,20,47,53,8,68

												Atmosphere... it's just great.It sucks you in right away. It feels like you're really in a horror story and you feel the tension almost all the time. Listening to a radio show or a TV show or when there is a day outside is like a moments of relief. Never thought a flashlight could be your greatest weapon... well, except for flashbang grenades, which, i think, are little overpowered, because you can kill almost every taken in your sight with one grenade. And those grenades aren't very rare.Last mission felt a bit too long and shallow - just fighting your way trough hordes of taken and angry cars, boats and other trash.Definitely will play one more time on nightmare difficulty to collect all the manuscript pages and other collectibles that aren't available on easier difficulties.Great and, in my opinion, unique game - 9/10			",197,35,10,29,14,2,40

												This game is wonderful. It plays like a Stephen King or Lovecraft story, and feels like an episode of The Twilight Zone. Combat mechanis are solid and varried enough that they never get boring. Enemies are interesting and the difficulty deffinitely ramps up as you progress through the game and get better at it. If you take the time to get invested in the story it is well worth it. My only qualm is that the facial motion capture is jaring and lackluster in cutscenes. Other than that, the voice acting is top-notch and the music selection is fantastic. Over all a very enjoyable experience.			",150,24,2,16,17,0,21

												I originally played this back in 2010 on the XB360 and had a great time and recently wanted to play it again. In the end I decided to give the PC version ago and managed to get it for something silly like £3. - The game looks great and his some very nice light effects. - Interesting story that's unpredictable. - A good mix between shooting, survival and driving elements in the game. - A good mix of different areas and keep things from getting to repetitive. - Includes the 2 DLCs that came separately on the consoles. The game can get a little repetitive if you play it for to long because it is basically fighting waves and waves of enemies in different situations but it's not that bad. The game took me around 12hrs to finish.			",264,375,0,78,10,0,0

												I had never played Alan Wake before and after seeing it on sale during the 2014 Summer Sale I decided to invest in it. This is by far one of the greatest storylines of any PC game that I have played; the detail, concept, graphics and soundtrack compliment the plot to make it one true masterpiece. Once I had downloaded and installed the game I adjusted my settings and went in game, the twelve hours I have on this game are from me playing this game back-to-back in a single day, the second best purchase of any game in my extensive Steam library; I can't recommend this game highly enough.Pros: A very well optimised game, I was well below the minimum requirements and still achieved a solid 30-45FPS on low settings. Captivating and perplex storyline that made me play the game from start to finish in a single day. Amazing graphics even on low settings, after seeing it running on ultra at 4K resolution, it looks even more amazing. After purchasing this game I recieved a free 320KBs MP3 copy of the soundtrack and it's absolutely astounding, the composer is to be congratulated.Cons: A sequel was made (Alan Wake's American Nightmare), but it felt more of a technical demonstration and failed to captivate me in the same way this game did.

												Highly recommend for it's unique story and gameplay, honestly you will not play any other game like this. The story can be confusing in the first few chapters but definitely stick at it because it well worth playing.Also people complain the game is not scary, and the answer to that is it's not meant to be, it is incredibly atmospheric (one of the most atmospheric games i've played) but if you do get scared easily (like me) it will happen from time to time.Buying the game also comes with the 2 DLC chapters that take place after the events of main game, as a continuation, so you WILL get the full story here and I hope Remedy Games decides to make Alan Wake 2 after it's released Quantum Break.Overall, I highly recommend this game			",36,5,0,1,0,0,0

												Alan Wake had a huge name before I even knew what it was about. Rumours and small spoils motivated me to play it for myself. On 1 May 2015 I finally set out on this adventure as a well known, cocky, used book writer who went on a retreat to Bright Falls in Washington, USA. It sets off on a slow pace and introduces you to all basic concepts and details.The main goal of Alan Wake was to create an immersive movie or story with little effort needed from the viewer, they achieved this with simple controls and an easy difficulty to play on. Do not be fooled and think that the entire story is all fun and games, at the end of each episode everything would get intense, hordes of taken would appear leaving you to fight or flee for your life.Categorised as a thriller I back the entire game, dwelling in silence with illuminating glare from the moon evolves slowly into a suspenseful walk with atmospheric music setting the tone of every scene. Even the classic jump scares are included, strolling through a home when suddenly a taken busts through the door charging you with al there is. Some were predictable and some were not, but balanced and not worn out.Physical gameplay felt unnatural and sloppy but to be fair it was a conversion form Xbox to PC. Minor glitches like getting stuck on something or jumping and getting stuck but no big problems.Graphics….. This was hard, reviewing in 2015 vs back in 2010 is quite a difference seeing that my GTX 760 made mincemeat of any graphical requirement it threw my way. Certain unpleasantness struck me in cinematics due to visible comers and edges, Alan’s Face his hands ect.BUTComparing to other titles released in 2010 it seems like the quality of visuals were up to standard, titles like Mass Effect 2, Just Cause 2, Assassin’s creed Brotherhood also had some of these characteristics that feels unpleasant to the eyes.This story was amazing and immersive…At first they make you compare yourself to Alan, at this stage you would feel all his pain. Then they drop an unravelling bomb on you where you start to hate our Hero, after a while you start agreeing again and feel his drive, anger, hatred and determination to finish his adventure.At the very end the unthinkable happens and they leave you on the biggest cliff-hanger ever created by mankind.They later on released special episodes 1 and 2 which continues the story after the story, these were not as good as the main story but also deserves your attention.  It does not really enlighten you about happenings after and if you can shut off your entire brain and only receive entertainment through playing games, I would implore you to do this as the FINAL did not give any closure and generated more hope than was needed.Unfortunately it seems that Alan Wake 2 will not make an appearance in the future, Quantum break releasing exclusively to Xbox one will receive this title. Producers and directors feel that it is not within the age or time to make a new Title to this extremely awesome piece of art and creative immersion.My next game would be Alan Wakes American Nightmare.Hit the review section up to see may say in a months’ time.FINAL VERDICT: ABSOLUTE YES, Add it to your rich-story category in your library.

												Remedy Entertainment have a varied history on different platformer and a solid background of really polished, clean cut games with quirky/interesting takes on standard games. To me, Remedy Entertainment produce games that are like the interesting B-Side of the hit Pop record, and that's what Alan Wake is: Weirder and more interesting than the Triple A's, but with all the polish and production value you'd expect of one.HighlightsSuspenseful collectables and foreshadowing are layered around a very detailed world to produce some startling moments and encounters.* A newer angle on combat and some survival elements which make sense in the world of Alan Wake.* Quirky and interesting details to uncover in the world if you're inquisitive.* Very polished and few bugs.AnnoyancesAlan Wake is often called Stephen King: The Game, which is meant as a good thing. Interestingly though, it suffers from the same problems as Stephen King novels and movie adaptations; almost silly story elements and inexplicable character motivations. Otherwise, on the whole, it's polished enough that it never lets you down in any one area.* Easier than similar games and has a real lack of challenge.* Often no variety of enemies and repetitive combat.RecommendationsGameplay comes in at a strong 11-14 hours play time and while it doesn't have much re-playability, it's a collector/achievement hunters dream. It's available on Steam at between £22.99/$29.99 and £29.99/$39.99 which, for a 4 year+ old game is simply overpriced. Fortunately it goes on sale very often for -80% and even comes up in Indie Bundles from time to time.* The DLC is a waste of time. Instead, you can find the Developer Commentaries on YouTube here

												Great action adventure with a fantastic story! The story alone is what kept me playing for 15 hours. The visuals and audio were beautiful, and the presentation of the content in a movie-like fashion was brilliant and fit the game perfectly. The NPCs in the game are VERY well done and helped lighten the mood in a dark game. Not to mention, I don't think I ever heard a repeated phrase by a character and I loved that about this game. The actual game play however was very poorly done for my taste. The fights were repetitive, predictable, intrusive, and unnecessary. Every 15 steps the game would interrupt my progression with a slow-motion introduction of a ""new"" set of enemies, and all I could think was ""just let me play the game"". It made enemies too familiar which took away any of the horror feel that they were supposed to bring to the game.There were a few pieces of actual game play that were fantastic and stood out from the rest in my eyes. The battle on the stage at the farm was the most enjoyable out of all of the combat scenes in the game. The music and the rock-and-roll stage scene made me feel like a boss killing all of the Taken, and having Barry there to cheer me on made it feel like I was fighting with a friend. Although not every combat scene can feel that epic, having more scenarios like this would have made the game play much more enjoyable. Even just changing up the music for other fights would have helped add variety.While I did not enjoy the combat, every other aspect of the game greatly helped it redeem itself. The entire story and ending left me in awe and I very much look forward to seeing it continue in the future. Definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a good story and an overall beautiful game.			",41,19,0,1,3,1,3

The ammo is sparce, and so are batteries, even thogh I almost always had at least 1 battery on me.[/h1]Story[/h1]Without spoiling the story at all, lets say its signifigantly well crafted, and by far one of the best stories ive ever heard in a game. Im a sucker for really good story so maybe thats why this is my number 1 game ever. I really loved the cliffhanger, leaving me thinking for days whats going on (a bit like [/i]American Horror Story?[/i]), and hs the depth of a well written movie.[/h1]Graphics[/h1]The game looks really good first of all.

												I always loved the masters of horror and suspense, H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, Alfred Hitchcock, Edgar Alan Poe,...And when I first heard about Alan Wake I got instantly attracted to the game. A story about a writer, who lost his wife, and now trying not just to get her back, but also trying to stop a dark force from being unleashed in the world maybe sound cliche, but the way they make this story really captures you into finishing it.The gameplay is fun and easy to learn, but not too easy, and rewards exploration with collectables (missing pages, radios, TVs, thermals, pyramids of cans to shoot, and also ammo and weapons).The combat can get a bit repetitive (see an enemy, flash him with your lantern, shoot him until he dies and repeat with the next enemy), but for me it didn't ruined the fun of the game.So yeah, if you like survival horror with a good story, buy this game.

												This game. I love the plot in this game, and I love the writing in this game. This baby uses it's chapters like episodes to a television series, giving you a recap of what happened, and a preview of what's to come. The combat allows you to evade if you get surrounded, so you always have the option to escape or fight (except specific times where you have to take everything down to advance for story reasons).I can't recommend this game enough. If you don't particularly care for games that try to creep you out with horror elements, rest assured that this isn't your gore-filled schlock that is churned out every year as a remix of the same thing - this is Alan Wake, and what you get is story. Ambient noise, suspense, and a non-reliance on jump scares is what make this game great - you are a writer trapped in a story, and it is an experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The vast and beautiful scenery in Alan Wake often gives the impression that the game is bigger than it is. I was, therefore, unsurprised to learn that the game was originally envisioned as being more of a free-roaming RPG before the limitations of the Xbox turned it into a a more liner 'on-rails' effort. And it shows. The landscape begs to be explored, but as soon as you travel any distance off the predetermined track you come to a cliff face or edge, and you start to feel a bit penned-in.The driving sections offer more of a sense of freedom, but even then you've got to stick to the road if you want to advance the plot.The story itself is interesting, and wears its Twilight Zone/Stephen King inspirations on its sleeve, but it has trouble captivating because from the very start you don't know what's real and what's a dream, which makes the threat feel too ethereal rather than something solid that can hurt you (even though it obviously can). You find yourself constantly wondering, 'is this bit a dream or real?', 'am I alive or dead?', 'do I really care?'.The atmosphere is the game's strongest point, and makes you wonder why more horror/suspense games don't do it better (I'm looking at you, Resident Evil series). The use of the flashlight is original, and the combat well executed, although it does suffer from being a tad repetitive by the game's end.It's a shame so much of the game is set at night (something necessary to the plot), because the graphics are showcased much better in the daylight scenes, and I'd have quite happily spent hours roaming around the hills and valleys of Bright Falls if given the opportunity.

												Although I am against console-to-PC port, this game has been done right. Alan Wake is reminiscent of silent hill and max payne and combines these two styles excellently. The story is very likeable and haunting. The characters, voice acting, script, dialogue and plot are great. The developers 'Remedy' have put love into this game and you see it.			",64,11,1,3,4,2,7

												This game was a lot of fun to play. To be honest at first I was a bit disappointed that there was only one direction to go, but as the tale went on I became completely emerged. Even though there is a classical struggle between light and dark, it did not feel like I was tumbling through cliches. The only thing that annoyed me in the end was that most of the ""human"" enemies only knew how to shout one and the same thing. I liked the story, thumbs up.			",50,8,0,27,10,0,6

												I always loved the masters of horror and suspense, H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, Alfred Hitchcock, Edgar Alan Poe,...And when I first heard about Alan Wake I got instantly attracted to the game. A story about a writer, who lost his wife, and now trying not just to get her back, but also trying to stop a dark force from being unleashed in the world maybe sound cliche, but the way they make this story really captures you into finishing it.The gameplay is fun and easy to learn, but not too easy, and rewards exploration with collectables (missing pages, radios, TVs, thermals, pyramids of cans to shoot, and also ammo and weapons).The combat can get a bit repetitive (see an enemy, flash him with your lantern, shoot him until he dies and repeat with the next enemy), but for me it didn't ruined the fun of the game.So yeah, if you like survival horror with a good story, buy this game.

												Alan Wake has made it's way to the number 1 spot of my top 10 games list. Heres the reasons why![/h1]Combat[/h1]The combat is a ton of fun and challanging at the same time. Many people thinkt the combat is gimick, but I ind it intuitive and somthing better then the normal "" shoot them till they die"" scenerio. The ammo is sparce, and so are batteries, even thogh I almost always had at least 1 battery on me.[/h1]Story[/h1]Without spoiling the story at all, lets say its signifigantly well crafted, and by far one of the best stories ive ever heard in a game. Im a sucker for really good story so maybe thats why this is my number 1 game ever. I really loved the cliffhanger, leaving me thinking for days whats going on (a bit like [/i]American Horror Story?[/i]), and hs the depth of a well written movie.[/h1]Graphics[/h1]The game looks really good first of all. The lighting is one of the best things about the graphics. Other than that it looks pretty good overall.[/h1]Verdict[/h1]10/10			",196,31,1,16,9,0,11

												With mounting pressure from his publishers and fans, a best-selling author suffering from writers block escapes with his wife to the small town of Bright Falls, Washington in search of peace and solitude. Instead, he is pulled into a twisted and dark nightmare when his wife mysteriously disappears. As the story plays out he finds himself battling himself as much as he is the dark enemies who appear around him, and the question never goes away: is it reality or is Alan Wake loosing his mind?PROS: The story is immersive, well written and excellently narrated Cool TV show like episodes give it a unique feel Music/SFX/voicovers are generally well done, play into the atmosphere Neat light/dark action combat idea Well developed town/characters (feels like out of a novel) Some decent logic puzzles scattered aboutCONS: Story drags a bit too long, gets out-of-hand Combat becomes too much of a focus later on (jumps between story, action piece, story, etc.) Control is a bit limiting/loose Lose weapons, items in between some sections of story Sometimes vague waypointsOverall, if the game is on sale I would highly recommend it. $30 (as it is when I write this) is a bit too much for a 6 year old game. That being said, it's generally a fun ride worth taking.			",131,72,0,27,6,0,9

												The vast and beautiful scenery in Alan Wake often gives the impression that the game is bigger than it is. I was, therefore, unsurprised to learn that the game was originally envisioned as being more of a free-roaming RPG before the limitations of the Xbox turned it into a a more liner 'on-rails' effort. And it shows. The landscape begs to be explored, but as soon as you travel any distance off the predetermined track you come to a cliff face or edge, and you start to feel a bit penned-in.The driving sections offer more of a sense of freedom, but even then you've got to stick to the road if you want to advance the plot.The story itself is interesting, and wears its Twilight Zone/Stephen King inspirations on its sleeve, but it has trouble captivating because from the very start you don't know what's real and what's a dream, which makes the threat feel too ethereal rather than something solid that can hurt you (even though it obviously can). You find yourself constantly wondering, 'is this bit a dream or real?', 'am I alive or dead?', 'do I really care?'.The atmosphere is the game's strongest point, and makes you wonder why more horror/suspense games don't do it better (I'm looking at you, Resident Evil series). The use of the flashlight is original, and the combat well executed, although it does suffer from being a tad repetitive by the game's end.It's a shame so much of the game is set at night (something necessary to the plot), because the graphics are showcased much better in the daylight scenes, and I'd have quite happily spent hours roaming around the hills and valleys of Bright Falls if given the opportunity.

												This game is an underated gem in the survial horror genreYou play as Alan Wake, a writter looking for his missing wife in a sleepy woodland town thats being taken over by living darkness.  What this game does best is presentaion and atmosphere.  The levels are gorgeous during the day and spooky during the night and you'll find your self jumping at shadows and curising the sound of the wind.  The story is presented as if you were in a living book with Alan narrating the events and objectives as you play.  Things start to get really intresting when you begin finding pages to a manuscript that you have no memory writing and that describe things you have no way of know or even things that have yet to occur.  Top that off with amazing sound design and a kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack and i've never been so emersed in a game before.The games main short coming is combat.  To kill enemies you have to shine a flashlight on them until they become vunerable before shooting them. and thats it.  And theres only about 4 or 5 enemy types in the whole game so combat becomes samey real fast.  they do try to mix things up every now and then by throwing you into ambushes where you have to fend of multipule waves of enemies at a disadvatge or giving you a driving segmant here and there.  At least the controls are solid so combat doesn't feel frustrating.  There are also little hidden story elements and item cashes hidden through out the enviroments like radio boradcasts or episodes of a strange show similar to outer limits or twilight zone. this adds a bit of exploration to the leves and gives at least a little replay value.  This isn't a perfect game but its one that you really should play if you want a solid story and great atomsphere.			",224,104,1,29,12,2,44

												Very mixed feelings about Alan Wake. The story was brilliant and intriguing, and for the time the gameplay was very inventive. The pages you find around the game are genuinly interesting which makes you actively look for them. However I quickly thought the gun combat was very tedious and often quite predictable, and I found myself pushing through that just to find out more about the story; this was true for many aspects of the game for me. There are a few puzzles a long the way but I never found myself stuck on any of them for long.I would recommend this game purely on the captivating story, but prepare for a grind; whether intentional or not.7/10			",64,7,0,9,4,0,7

												I had never played Alan Wake before and after seeing it on sale during the 2014 Summer Sale I decided to invest in it. This is by far one of the greatest storylines of any PC game that I have played; the detail, concept, graphics and soundtrack compliment the plot to make it one true masterpiece. Once I had downloaded and installed the game I adjusted my settings and went in game, the twelve hours I have on this game are from me playing this game back-to-back in a single day, the second best purchase of any game in my extensive Steam library; I can't recommend this game highly enough.Pros: A very well optimised game, I was well below the minimum requirements and still achieved a solid 30-45FPS on low settings. Captivating and perplex storyline that made me play the game from start to finish in a single day. Amazing graphics even on low settings, after seeing it running on ultra at 4K resolution, it looks even more amazing. After purchasing this game I recieved a free 320KBs MP3 copy of the soundtrack and it's absolutely astounding, the composer is to be congratulated.Cons: A sequel was made (Alan Wake's American Nightmare), but it felt more of a technical demonstration and failed to captivate me in the same way this game did.

												This game is a relief from all the cliche horror with jump scares or cheap death that we all are getting nowadays. I know it's an old game and I just got to play it recently. The game introduces a novel writer as your protagonist with a flashlight and a handy revolver to subdue your enemy. It may feel a bit bland but sometimes what is plain simple and bland is the most effective.Storyline wise , it was perfect, finishing chapter after chapter has never felt so satisfying as playing Alan Wake. It has good suspense and leave you at cliffhanger everytime you finish a chapter, which makes you wanna continue playing the game and find out what happens next.  Gameplay wise is good, no problem with me so far and the controls are easy to master.9/10 would wake Alan again.			",81,12,0,8,4,1,6

												Alan Wake is one of pleasant surprises when it comes to games i've played this year. You start off as a book writer, not a commando or spy or anyone related in military in that matter, that got cought in a nightmare. It starts off with Alan driving through a dark road and hitting someone with a car. When Alan checked who did he hit he saw nothing. But after he started to walk on foot the mysterious character from his one of his written books started to chase him. Few minutes later you learn that the everything is covered in shadows and the only way to harm your enemies is to aim your flashlight directly to your foe and remove armor of shadow for him to become vulnarable. It's pretty interesting mechanic but it gets tedious after a while. The story  once reference Stephen King novels and I figured it might have been huge influence making the game since in some ways it feels like playing S.K. novel. Gameplay is pretty weak in this game. Limited weaponry, driving sections are worst part of the game. However if you go search for secret documents which are scattered through levels, you get better immersion. So even tho game had some mechanics i didn't enjoy it's still pretty decent game. 6.5/10			",61,11,0,4,2,0,2

												Anyone who feels they missed out on Alan Wake when it was released to console need not fret any longer. Despite it being a port from the Xbox 360 Console, Alan Wake for PC has incredible controls and feels natural to play. From a technical aspect I found very little wrong with the game. I'd wager to say it's the best port I've ever played.For those who don't already know, Alan wake features a very dark atmosphere with some very engrossing gameplay and a twisted and intriguing storyline. The main campaign has a very good flow taking the protagonist from confused and scared to confident and determined; feelings that the player is able to share as the plot develops.Objectives are mapped out well and while the game gives enough space for you to approach situations in your own style, you won't have to worry about becoming lost or stuck. I never got the feeling that objectives shaped the terrain, rather that this was a genuine landscape with believable locations and characters.			",349,50,5,41,19,1,32

Combat mechanis are solid and varried enough that they never get boring. Enemies are interesting and the difficulty deffinitely ramps up as you progress through the game and get better at it. If you take the time to get invested in the story it is well worth it. My only qualm is that the facial motion capture is jaring and lackluster in cutscenes. Other than that, the voice acting is top-notch and the music selection is fantastic. Over all a very enjoyable experience.			",150,24,2,16,17,0,21

												Truly cinematic in scope: exceptional storyline, beautiful environments, superlative acting.With very few negatives, the primary is the lack of a first-person perspective option, as the off-centre third-person camera angle feels like driving a three-wheeled shopping cart. Also, the characters look a little cross-eyed at times.Recommended playing environment: dead of night, lights off, headphones on, home alone.

												One of my favourite games I have played. It is not a pop-up scare game but works more on a persons psyche, which beautifully mirrors Stephen King and his works. As for the shooting aspect and over game mechanics: I really can't say much, it isn't meant to be a shooter so I didn't expect the aim mechanics to be 100% accurate (also to be fair he is a writer not a military soldier).Just for anyone borderline about buying this game, a bit like Amnesia: dark descent, DO NOT buy it to win. This game has a great story, which is its main focus and running through the game at record speed won't let you enjoy the environment or be enthralled by its storyline. Though I must digress that some characters could have been drawn out a bit better like Wake's wife. It's hard to sympathise for someone you only meet in the opening cutscene of the game, so no emotional attachment leads to a longer timeframe to actually begin your association with the protagonist			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is another stunning example of a stylish cinematic (and yet rich in gameplay) narrative experience that has become a trademark of Remedy Entertainment. Following the story of a writer who may or may not have found himself inside a horror novel he has been writing, this game is a delightfully postmodern journey that constantly makes the player doubt his perception, and the reality of time/space. What is true, what is but a dream, is the protagonist a ""real"" man or a character - but wait, isn't he the character of a game that you're playing? Drawing heavily on the style and works of Stephen King and David Lynch, Alan Wake leads you through a dangerous track of uncertainty, and through that achieves genuine tension. It may not be a very scary ""horror game"", but it definitely is filled with anxiety.Another highlight of Alan Wake is its unique multi-layered narrative - one that can only be found in the art of interactive media. The plot unfolds simultaneously through a variety of sources: the actual story experience, pages of an in-game novel that the player collects, occasional radio broadcasts, the timely use of licensed and original music, episodes of an in-game TV series... *and* the TV series that the game pretends to be with its episodic format! It's clever, it's ever dynamic and it is also a smart instrument of manipulating our fears. Every now and then the games ""spoils"" an event to come  - for example, by revealing an attack on the protagonist with the next page of a novel - yet it deliberately omits the circumstances, the ""where"" and ""when"", thus driving the player to assume that the said event might happen anywhere and at any time during the episode.With Alan Wake, Remedy Entertainment also re-establishes itself as one of the leaders in video game art direction. While it's simple to say the game is a beautiful one - and remains so even even now, at the dawn on the new console generation - it is first and foremost *effective* in employing colors, character and location design and, naturally, light and shadows to affect the player emotionally. Like any good horror story, Alan Wake builds up tension not as much through confrontation with ""scary stuff"" as it does by visually dividing safe areas, small and well-lit, and the vast dark misty territory of the unknown dangers outside. The game encourages exploration through various collectibles, yet here exploration require courage.In the world of Alan Wake, every step is not taken lightly - and thus matters all the more. This game is an engaging experience with a complex story, fascinating characters (all the more fascinating because of how they might not be real), outstanding game design and a sense of dread that is sure to cling to you for days to come, making your heart skip a beat every time you find yourself on a dark street with only a faint light of street lamp in the distance.

												Do you like Stephen King? Would you like him in a game? Would you like him to take aim?Alan Wake is not a scary story. It has jumps, and can manage being creepy at times, but is the kind of ""safe"" horror that King often manages. A spooky, evil presence chases him around a northwest town obviously inspired by Twin Peaks (the developers' previous series, Max Payne, had an outright parody of the series) while he uses a flashlight to banish the evil - and then generally shoot it.I'm honestly uncertain whether or not this game is intended to have its tongue in cheek, but it's very much self-referential b-movie horror, and in that aspect it actually works quite well. Enemies growl ridiculous one-liners pointing to their former humanity, evil machines menace you, spooky messages from TVs - if you're willing to roll with the odd half-serious flavor and take in all the goofy story chunks, it's solid for fans of the survival horror genre. Mouse aiming makes the game a lot less challenging than I think it was intended, though the difficulty flips when you're outnumbered, as Alan doesn't have a great way to deal with being rushed from three sides, and the camera can definitely work against you when that happens. The way it uses light to relieve and increase tension is actually pretty smart, though the gameplay itself remains simple and somewhat repetitive throughout.Overall, though, I rather liked it. The story kept me engaged, and the threat ramps up to delightfully farcical levels by the end. It ends on a cliffhanger that leads into American Nightmare, which is interesting and flawed in about equal measure, and the sequel it needs has never materialized out of the darkness. It does include the console DLC that provides more resolution, and though the content in the DLC chapters seems warmed over, it does take breaking the fourth wall to an clever level. Ultimately it's a good romp if you're looking for a 90s b-movie that involves shooting a lot of grumpy, gloomy, guses along the way.			",506,140,11,70,29,5,65

												This was an absolutely fantastic game from start to finish. A fair horror elemen (especially early on when it's all still new) and a wonderful story intertwined with and evoking great literature.However the game does have a few drawbacks in my opinion1: As a horror game it begins to slip in the middle and late stages of the main story. The DLC on the other hand handles this very well.2: At first glance it seems this game won't be just another shooter, but as soon as the sun goes down you find yourself gunning down a town worth of monster people.Still a wonderful game that I highly recommend.

												This game has really surprised me.I recieved it as a gift shortly before Christmas, and waited a while to play it.  My Fiance watched me play the first scene or two.  She then demanded that I was not allowed to play the game if she wasn't here - because she LOVED watching it.And I did too -  just as much as I loved playing it.  It unfolds like an awesome movie - but with more detail than a movie... more like an awesome book.  Which fits the bill perfectly, since you're playing an Author.Maybe as an Author myself (ask me about my blogs!) this game touched base with me more easily than it would others, but I would still recommend it to anyone.  The flashlight + pistol gameplay feels different than any other game I've ever played.  The enemies are actually scary, and when you need to get away from one in a hurry, the situation will leave your palms sweating.10/10. Very suspenseful game that is both a joy to play and a joy to watch / listen to. Excellent writing.  This game deserves so many more accolades than it has recieved, and I honestly feel like you'd be missing out on one of the most unique game experiences you'll ever have if you pass this game up.

												Alan Wake is another stunning example of a stylish cinematic (and yet rich in gameplay) narrative experience that has become a trademark of Remedy Entertainment. Following the story of a writer who may or may not have found himself inside a horror novel he has been writing, this game is a delightfully postmodern journey that constantly makes the player doubt his perception, and the reality of time/space. What is true, what is but a dream, is the protagonist a ""real"" man or a character - but wait, isn't he the character of a game that you're playing? Drawing heavily on the style and works of Stephen King and David Lynch, Alan Wake leads you through a dangerous track of uncertainty, and through that achieves genuine tension. It may not be a very scary ""horror game"", but it definitely is filled with anxiety.Another highlight of Alan Wake is its unique multi-layered narrative - one that can only be found in the art of interactive media. The plot unfolds simultaneously through a variety of sources: the actual story experience, pages of an in-game novel that the player collects, occasional radio broadcasts, the timely use of licensed and original music, episodes of an in-game TV series... *and* the TV series that the game pretends to be with its episodic format! It's clever, it's ever dynamic and it is also a smart instrument of manipulating our fears. Every now and then the games ""spoils"" an event to come  - for example, by revealing an attack on the protagonist with the next page of a novel - yet it deliberately omits the circumstances, the ""where"" and ""when"", thus driving the player to assume that the said event might happen anywhere and at any time during the episode.With Alan Wake, Remedy Entertainment also re-establishes itself as one of the leaders in video game art direction. While it's simple to say the game is a beautiful one - and remains so even even now, at the dawn on the new console generation - it is first and foremost *effective* in employing colors, character and location design and, naturally, light and shadows to affect the player emotionally. Like any good horror story, Alan Wake builds up tension not as much through confrontation with ""scary stuff"" as it does by visually dividing safe areas, small and well-lit, and the vast dark misty territory of the unknown dangers outside. The game encourages exploration through various collectibles, yet here exploration require courage.In the world of Alan Wake, every step is not taken lightly - and thus matters all the more. This game is an engaging experience with a complex story, fascinating characters (all the more fascinating because of how they might not be real), outstanding game design and a sense of dread that is sure to cling to you for days to come, making your heart skip a beat every time you find yourself on a dark street with only a faint light of street lamp in the distance.

												I am revisiting this game in 2016 after leaving it incomplete years ago, and it still holds up pretty well.The graphics are a bit dated but they still work, the face motion can look a tad awkward at times if you really want to nitpick it, but everything else, the athmosphere specially, looks pretty nice still.Everything that has been said about this game, the story, the voice acting, the pacing, is still true, if you approach this game open to an experience, you'll be hooked, and although the game itself is not very long by today's standards, for a  horror game, it's not bad at all, Twilight Zone fans should find it specially appealing, Alan Wake is a great nod to the show and it serves a similar kind of horror.You should play this game like reading a good book, at night, when everything else is quiet, just a chapter or two at a time.8/10 Easily.

												Despite the controls, which seems to be a source of anguish in just about every survival horror game, Alan Wake is a solid game guaranteed to keep you playing 'one more checkpoint' or 'one more chapter'. I started it yesterday and played it the whole day (with my shutters closed of course) and it hasn't bored me yet. The story is gripping and the characters are well-defined, even though the facial animation is so sloppy everyone seems to be suffering from a stroke all the time. And even though Wake is a geeky writer, it's extremely irritating to see him get winded, slowing to the speed of an octogenarian and gasping for breath every two seconds, even with crazy axe murderers chasing after him. As always, with any computer game in the history of the world, driving is horribly implemented (steering with the WASD keys, in this day and age? Seriously?!), and the strangely skewed third-person perspective is a bit uncomfortable for first-person aficionados like me, but I suppose that's part of the survival horror genre.I'm not gonna review graphics and stuff, because seriously, who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥as long as the game is good? (They're lovely though)Still, those little things aside, if you like survival horror, this is a must-buy, and even if you're just indifferent to the genre, like me, it's still a worthwhile purchase - but wait 'til it's on sale again.

												Alan Wake feels very much like a cheesy hollywood horror flick or a typical episode of the Twilight Zone. You play as Alan Wake, a best-selling author who hasn't been able to finish a book in years. His wife thinks that a vacation would help him write, but everything goes terribly wrong, of course, as his wife disappears in the night.It's mostly an action game, but the story does veer more toward the horror side of things. This game wasn't really scary IMO (possibly because you play in the 3rd person), but the themes are still definitely horror-focused, so keep that in mind. You can choose to fight or run, and both will work fine on the normal difficulty. The character animations and facial textures are a bit underwhelming, but the rest of the game looks pretty good.

												Great game.Love the shooting, the looting, the humor, the world. Interesting story, good ambience throughout the game. Not an easy game to gets all collectibles so there's a challenge there if you plan on getting them all. Obviously more-so when choosing a harder difficulty. I recomend getting a feel how the game works, then turning of the hud for more immersive gameplay.Controls are a bit clunky, but this game is a Xbox port, and you get a handle on the controls pretty easily. Vehicle controls are complete crap, though, but ""dealable"".Totaly recomend at least one playthrough.			",85,18,2,2,7,2,6

It has the panache of a Stephen King's thriller novel and many references to popular culture (The Shining movie, Norse mythology, etc.) Also, the graphics are incredibly beautiful and Remedy (the team behind the excellent Max Payne series) did a really great job with Alan Wake.

												Игра с отличным закрученным сюжетом. Всем советую поиграть!Сюжет игры повествует о приключениях писателя Алана Уэйка, автора бестселлеров в жанре «триллера», оказавшегося в городе Брайт-Фоллс, штата Вашингтон, где оживают персонажи и события его произведений. Пытаясь разобраться в происходящем и выяснить, что случилось с его женой, Алан узнаёт много неожиданного о маленьком городке — раньше здесь жил писатель Томас Зэйн. Его жена погибла, утонув при странных обстоятельствах в озере, рядом с которым они жили, хотя она и была прекрасной пловчихой. Зэйн, ныряющий на дно озера, в один прекрасный день обнаруживает там некую плывущую чёрную массу, с которой заключает сделку. Сделка состояла в том, что Зэйн пишет рассказ, и высвобождает Тёмную Сущность со дна озера. Она же в свою очередь воскрешает его жену — Барбару Джаггер.Барбара ожила, но это была лишь человеческая оболочка, заполненная Тёмной Сущностью. Томас осознаёт свою ошибку и вырезает Барбаре сердце, пытаясь уничтожить освобождённое им зло. Но это не останавливает Тёмную Сущность, Барбара по прежнему жива, и тогда он уходит вместе с ней под воду, но так и не достигает дна. А остров с домом исчезли, оставив жителей с новостью об ожившем вулкане под озером в 70-е. Призванный пером Алана, он приходит к нему на помощь и на краткий миг ослабляет Тёмную Сущность. Воспользовавшись этим, Уэйк в ужасе убегает из домика на острове, разбивается на машине, но выживает. Теперь ему придётся пройти сквозь океан ужаса и безумия, выжигая себе путь фонариком и встречая злобных тварей, от захваченного Тёмной Сущностью охотника и сошедших с ума федералов до завораживающего сердце торнадо.Кому лень это читать: http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake#.D0.A1.D1.8E.D0.B6.D0.B5.D1.82 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake does a great job of mixing good action with an interesting narrative full of thrills among nightmare, reality and supernatural.It has great enviromental design and wonderful visual that will remind you the inspiration it took from Twin Peaks, both in narrative and setting.Although a little ripetitive, the gameplay is enough satisfying that will keep you glued to the screen until the very end.

												A thriller action adventure that plays with light and darkness. You take the role of Alan Wake, a writer, who goes on a vacation with his wife. Too bad their cottage (or the lake around it) is haunted and the darkness takes his wife hostage. Alan hits his head and is confused, alarmed and out-right horrified to find himself attacked by shadowy but unearthly shapes of townsfolk, friends and enemies alike. To survive he has to use light and gunmanship.Basically Alan meets a number of horrors along the way and beats most of them with elaborate use of light, guns and fast feet. Story advances smoothly along six chapters, each of which brings new kinds of enemies, tools and of course lore and insight into the destiny of Alan.After enjoying the story once you can play it through on a higher difficulty level, dubbed Nightmare, with stronger enemies and due to that scarcer resources. There are also two bonus chapters that are situated after the main story. The whole game takes anything from 15 to 25 hours to play through, more if you play it through with the higher difficulty level and even more if you go looking for all the extra stuff that gives you achievements. The main attraction however, at least to me, was the story that is enhanced by the immersion provided by believable body language and good voice acting.Get it for full price and you probably won't regret it anyway, but the game is frequently on a high discount that gets you a nice thrilling story with a price of a large soda.

												Игра с отличным закрученным сюжетом. Всем советую поиграть!Сюжет игры повествует о приключениях писателя Алана Уэйка, автора бестселлеров в жанре «триллера», оказавшегося в городе Брайт-Фоллс, штата Вашингтон, где оживают персонажи и события его произведений. Пытаясь разобраться в происходящем и выяснить, что случилось с его женой, Алан узнаёт много неожиданного о маленьком городке — раньше здесь жил писатель Томас Зэйн. Его жена погибла, утонув при странных обстоятельствах в озере, рядом с которым они жили, хотя она и была прекрасной пловчихой. Зэйн, ныряющий на дно озера, в один прекрасный день обнаруживает там некую плывущую чёрную массу, с которой заключает сделку. Сделка состояла в том, что Зэйн пишет рассказ, и высвобождает Тёмную Сущность со дна озера. Она же в свою очередь воскрешает его жену — Барбару Джаггер.Барбара ожила, но это была лишь человеческая оболочка, заполненная Тёмной Сущностью. Томас осознаёт свою ошибку и вырезает Барбаре сердце, пытаясь уничтожить освобождённое им зло. Но это не останавливает Тёмную Сущность, Барбара по прежнему жива, и тогда он уходит вместе с ней под воду, но так и не достигает дна. А остров с домом исчезли, оставив жителей с новостью об ожившем вулкане под озером в 70-е. Призванный пером Алана, он приходит к нему на помощь и на краткий миг ослабляет Тёмную Сущность. Воспользовавшись этим, Уэйк в ужасе убегает из домика на острове, разбивается на машине, но выживает. Теперь ему придётся пройти сквозь океан ужаса и безумия, выжигая себе путь фонариком и встречая злобных тварей, от захваченного Тёмной Сущностью охотника и сошедших с ума федералов до завораживающего сердце торнадо.Кому лень это читать: http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake#.D0.A1.D1.8E.D0.B6.D0.B5.D1.82 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake features an extremely entertaining and engrossing storyline complete with gorgeous visuals, a fantastic soundtrack, and fluent (optimized), mechanics. The game throws you into the middle of a familiar, yet unknown landscape (level design is excellent!), where you are forced to survive the onslaught of darkness and insanity with naught but a flashlight and pistol, all the while trying to figure out the cause and consequence of the characters actions through self narration via manuscripts you find throughout the journey. Alan Wake was a pleasant surprise in both quality and enjoyment, and comes recommended highly!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It really sets the tone for a dark game that sends chills down your spine. The effects of breathing down your neck genuinely creates spine tingling fear that melts your resolve. The gameplay can be a little awkward, although I am sure that is just my stubby finers combined with panic induced key bashing. The storyline will keep you hooked and this is genuinely a game I could not stop playing. Will be playing the second one as soon as possible and as soon as more comes out I will devour that like this game devours your soul.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The way you use the flashlight is interesting and unique, and the product placement for battery brands is just amusing.   The story itself is the real seller, though.  It's just amazing, and I can't sell you on it fully without possibly spoiling it.  It's a great journey and experience.

It has a fascinating story, beautiful graphics and great sound composition making it a must-have for horror fans. The game itself is structured through episodic adventures and alludes to many great artists such as Stephen King and Alfred Hitchcock as their influence is evident in the game. Alan Wake is one of the greatest horror video games of our time and it should be played alone in the dark with headphones!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It really is its strongest point, and I simply love it. You should definitively buy this game if you like action/horror games with an intense and very deep (horror)story.And the soundtrack?

												Alan Wake, still the best flashlight game ever made. More non-rechargeable batteries are used here than at toys-r-us.  It's about a man, his flashlight, a wooded area of North America, lots of wind and guys trying to kill you with axes.  Basically, we are talking about your typical skiing vacation. I like the cut-scenes, that's when the developer goes the extra mile to make the graphics work.  But in this game, the character facial movements resemble a bad Hollywood botox treatment repeated 1000 times.  The attempt to match words with lips is definitely an alien concept.  (Please don't tell the developers and hurt their feelings. They are very very sensitive and I hear them crying right now.)  I really don't know what I am trying to communicate here. But there's a cool looking babe walking there across the street! Can you tell that I am typing my own introspective thinking? Yeah, it's boring. Sorry. Hope this review helped you decide something.

												I especially  liked the combat, while simple, works well for the game and keeps the survival feeling. I never got tired of it either, whenever you get that barely made stumbling dodge you breathe a sigh of relief as you have a few precious moments to regain composure. The darkness will take you if you're not aware at all times, but luckily enough it's also not unfair about it. You'll also learn to love flares, which are just very fun to pop when you're surrounded as the combat can get very cinematic. (without any hitch ups in my experience) The entire experience is a wonderful one, between the music, the visuals, the narrative and the plot, it's a great experience. And it never falls into typical horror story sillyness, yes things will jump out at you, but the real danger is because the darkness itself is something that cannot be fought directly. Alan can slow it down all he likes, but it'll take a lot more than a torch and a revolver to end it. And that feeling sticks with you, you can fend off the darkness, but beating it? Now that's a whole different story... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fantastic! I know many will go into expecting something like Silent Hill or other franchise survival-horror games but this is something completely different.  Alan Wake offers atmosphere and likeable characters over dense mechanics and the most fun you will have in this game is standing and listening to the radio, thinking about what has transpired and what it all means.  Though they are simplistic, the mechanics are very intuative and fun and keep the story moving forward which is crucial.  There are even moments where the mechanics are used in very intricate ways and create a very balanced feel to all the missions.  Alan Wake as a protangonist is goofy but I feel that the campy attitude only serves to tell a more compelling story and ultimately makes the game more fun over scary.  Highly recommended!

												I played through Alan Wake a year or so ago based on the recommendations of some friends. It turned out to be a fantastic survival horror type game that really centers on the story. If you’ve played the Max Payne games you’ll have a good idea of how the game story I presented. It’s almost like an interactive movie, making the first playthrough great, but might cut down the replay value (because you already know what happens).Spoilers aheadYou play the title character Alan Wake, a horror writer visiting a small town with his wife to get some rest & relaxation. After you reach your cabin in the woods, strange things start happening. Your wife disappears and the world is cast in darkness. Think Silent Hill, but instead of a “Hell World” it’s like night with swirling shadows all over. You eventually get pursued by law enforcement including a crazy FBI agent who seems to really hate you for some reason. All the while as you move through the world, you find glowing typewritten pages that are kind of like a book that you’re living (the pages are out of order though, so you don’t know what’s going to happen next). It turns out later that you’re living out a novel that you’ve forgotten writing and an evil force is trying to get you to write it in a certain way (so the evil force wins). Throughout the game there is voice over narration (by your character) that does a good job laying things out as well as describing the confusion that will probably be going through your mind. The game is played as a third person shooter where you will find various guns to use to defend yourself from the darkness. The enemies are mostly humans that have been “possessed” by the darkness and seem to have swirling shadows around them. These enemies are invincible until you destroy the shadows around them with your primary weapon, a flashlight. After the shadows are gone you can blast them with your regular guns. This is one of the only games I’ve played where the flare gun is the best weapon in the game. The flare gun totally destroys every enemy on screen with its bright flash. Pros:+Excellent story – practically an interactive movie.+Some scary parts when the enemies come after you in the dark.+Easy Steam achievements in this game :)+Cheap – the game was in a Humble Bundle for $1Cons:-Lower replay value due to it being so cinematic. Wait about a year before playing it again.-This is one of those games that can give you a headache when you play, not sure why. Probably because of the swirling shadows that are everywhere.-The game heated up my video card despite being on low settings. Overall I would recommend the game to anyone who enjoys horror, psychological thrillers, or just good stories. There is some very mild puzzle solving in the game but it’s mostly straightforward. If you get lost, just run towards the light! The sequel Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is a bit of a letdown afterwards. The same game mechanics apply but there is much less variety and less of a horror aspect. You can probably find the two games for cheap though since they seem to be on sale quite often for less than $5. The Steam edition includes 2 DLCs: The Signal, and The Writer. I skipped over them the first time I played the game but I’m trying them now. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Alan... wake up!"" This is a damn good game I wonder why I never played it sooner. I guess the taken (main enemies) had put me off in the beginning. Once you learn how to defeat them efficiently you will love the combat! The atmosphere really makes you feel like your in a small town where everybody knows each other. The game looks beautiful in 1080p. The narrative direction the story takes is in ""episodes"" which is 6 in total for the main story. The story itself is very captivating, you play as a writer named Alan who's fictional story is brought to life by a dark prescence in the small town. The ending of the story will have you questioning what actually happened because there is a cliff hanger akin to Inception. Maybe the answer is in the sequel game Alan Wake American Nightmare. All in all, I would give the game a 9/10 and highly reccomend it if you enjoy a good story without too many distractions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gameplay of light against darkness is neat at first, but as the game goes on it becomes slightly tedious. I played it with a controller which I would highly recommend using one. The controls were smooth and worked well. If you enjoy third person action/adventure games, then you should certainly pick this up on sale. It's worth it for the story alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played through Alan Wake a year or so ago based on the recommendations of some friends. It turned out to be a fantastic survival horror type game that really centers on the story. If you’ve played the Max Payne games you’ll have a good idea of how the game story I presented. It’s almost like an interactive movie, making the first playthrough great, but might cut down the replay value (because you already know what happens).Spoilers aheadYou play the title character Alan Wake, a horror writer visiting a small town with his wife to get some rest & relaxation. After you reach your cabin in the woods, strange things start happening. Your wife disappears and the world is cast in darkness. Think Silent Hill, but instead of a “Hell World” it’s like night with swirling shadows all over. You eventually get pursued by law enforcement including a crazy FBI agent who seems to really hate you for some reason. All the while as you move through the world, you find glowing typewritten pages that are kind of like a book that you’re living (the pages are out of order though, so you don’t know what’s going to happen next). It turns out later that you’re living out a novel that you’ve forgotten writing and an evil force is trying to get you to write it in a certain way (so the evil force wins). Throughout the game there is voice over narration (by your character) that does a good job laying things out as well as describing the confusion that will probably be going through your mind. The game is played as a third person shooter where you will find various guns to use to defend yourself from the darkness. The enemies are mostly humans that have been “possessed” by the darkness and seem to have swirling shadows around them. These enemies are invincible until you destroy the shadows around them with your primary weapon, a flashlight. After the shadows are gone you can blast them with your regular guns. This is one of the only games I’ve played where the flare gun is the best weapon in the game. The flare gun totally destroys every enemy on screen with its bright flash. Pros:+Excellent story – practically an interactive movie.+Some scary parts when the enemies come after you in the dark.+Easy Steam achievements in this game :)+Cheap – the game was in a Humble Bundle for $1Cons:-Lower replay value due to it being so cinematic. Wait about a year before playing it again.-This is one of those games that can give you a headache when you play, not sure why. Probably because of the swirling shadows that are everywhere.-The game heated up my video card despite being on low settings. Overall I would recommend the game to anyone who enjoys horror, psychological thrillers, or just good stories. There is some very mild puzzle solving in the game but it’s mostly straightforward. If you get lost, just run towards the light! The sequel Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is a bit of a letdown afterwards. The same game mechanics apply but there is much less variety and less of a horror aspect. You can probably find the two games for cheap though since they seem to be on sale quite often for less than $5. The Steam edition includes 2 DLCs: The Signal, and The Writer. I skipped over them the first time I played the game but I’m trying them now. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like playing a Stephen King novel. Great story, well-fleshed and interesting characters, Alan Wake is completely story driven, awash with chracter development, plot twists, and great dialogue. The controls can be a little clunky as the run button is the same as the doge button. And I did get a little tired of Alan Wake's complete lack of fitness as I struggled to sprint more than 50 meters when running away from the shadowy nasties. The gameplay isn't overly complex which isn't a bad thing as it allows to concentrate more on what is going on.Alan Wake is an adventure game with strong elements of action and horror and highly recommended for anyone who wants to play through a good story.

												What can I say about Alan Wake? Its an interesting game by the guys who did Max Payne, and it shows; Alan Wake is a story focused action thriller, much like Max Payne, but instead of being a neo-noir crime thriller set in New York City, Alan Wake is a supernatural thriller (though some people might call it horror, i'm a little hesitant to call it such, since it's not really scary) set in the fictional town of Bright Falls, Washington. Though it does have some shortcomings, ultimately, Alan Wake is a engrossing piece of fiction which does it's best to recapture the cinematic storytelling of Max Payne, and for the most part, it delivers.The game is visually impressive, with lighting being both stunning and a key part of the gameplay, and models being fairly well detailed. The shadowy particle effects when the enemies show up is neat, and overall the game exudes atmostphere. The musical score is decent, though utimately forgettable. Gameplay is probably the weakest aspect of Alan Wake, but it's still suprisingly solid. It has your standard set of third person controls, but what it adds is it's light mechanic. Enemies in the game cannot be killed unless they are weakened by light first. This can be from your torch (flashlight), a flare gun, or really any light source lying around. Enemies won't attack you under street lamps for instance, though often, to continue, you have to go out into the darkness and fight the enemies. there are some puzzley section in the game, but they aren't too difficult to figure out, but it's worth mentioning.Where Alan Wake really shines is in it's narrative, but moreso how it tells this narrative. While at first narrration by a Stephen King-esque character seems like it wouldn't be quite so interesting, the delivery is great. When things start to go wrong in Bright Falls, the atmosphere compliments the narratation. It works quite well, and in additon, splitting up the game into segmented chapters also adds to the Twin Peaks feel to the game. The story has plenty of twists and turns, and the dialogue is written well enough to keep you engaged. While the ending is somewhat dissapointing, Alan Wake's story (moreso it's storytelling) is excellent and will keep you engrossed until the end. If you like narrative driven games, or you like supernatural thrillers reminiscent of Stephen King or Twin Peaks, Alan Wake is definitely a recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I feel like this game was marketed a bit wrong.At the time, this may have been a scary game, but certain mechanics and its writing were not original or top notch. Some reviewers noted how unique the light mechanic used in game was: you have to shine your light on enemies for a limited time before they can be taken down. However a similar mechanic was used nearly a decade earlier in Luigi's mansion (and there were probably games before and after that with similar mechanics as well, if we consider this a formula of ""weaken with X in order to finish of with Y"").Well aside from mechanics, the writing was highly praised. The writing in this game is functional, but it's nothing to write home about. These days it is much more common for a game's writing to blow people away (Telltale's Walking Dead comes to mind) but, there were games before Alan Wake (2010 on consoles, 2012 on PC) that had terrific writing. Planescape Torment, Fallout 2, Grim Fandango, Xenogear, System Shock 2, I don't think I could go on all day, but my point is clear: great video game writing existed before Alan Wake. More importantly, great synthesis of writing and gameplay existed before Alan Wake, and it is notably missing here. There are the usual suspects apparent: some cut scenes that offer little exposition and only serve to take control away from the player, some (probably most) of the characters are flat and cliche, some of the dialouge is lacking. However none of this is a huge offense, we are all just looking at it the wrong way.Alan Wake is largely a popcorn ""horror"" game. So, the writing has to be looked at through a different lens. The Sound and Fury is a terrific novel, as is Catch 22, but they are different kinds of novels trying to do different things in very different ways. So, Alan Wake is neither Faulkner or Heller. For better or worse, Alan Wake is a love letter to Stephen King, mostly. There are some heavy nods to the genius that is Rod Serling (of Twilight Zone fame) as well as Lynch (Twin Peaks). And these nods to the greats show in the lore, setting, and (still pretty cliche) characters. What that means for this game is, it is enjoyable. The writing is not some literary beast, chewing up the conventions of writing and spraying corrosive ideologies all over the human intellect. Alan Wake is simply a great blockbuster horror flick that you can play.After bleeding out all the things that didn't work, lets quickly look at what does. The use of missing pages from a manuscript do evolve into something better later, and it feels organic, which something everyone should appreciate in a good game. Where the main game is filling a general niche in the video game market, the 2 special episodes that serve as the games epilogue serve a much better purpose. I would have probably paid full price (or just 50% off, because this is Steam) for the 2 special episodes alone; these episodes show the mindbending game I was expecting when I thouht of a writer facing his writings in a game.There are some thrilling moments, nice camerawork, and overall smooth experience.There are some thrilling moments, nice camerawork, and overall smooth experience. Ambience and enjoyable writing match up nicely to make this solid game. Give it a try when the price is right for you, and I'm sure there is some aspect you will enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a must play for fans of third person survival horror games, it satisfies both craves. This is one of the most gorgeous looking games i've ever played and the landscapes unfold like images from a night mare, anyone susceptible to jump scares will have there hands full with this gem, the games at it's best when your alone in the wood's after dark with a enemy sneaking up behind you. The game play unlike most horror games is superb and sits on a throne above the rest in it's genre, each chapter introduces a new game play mechanic, the pacing makes it so you never get bored. The enemies and there AI are a joy and combat is very fun and is complimented by great control, my only complaint is theres no way to quickly turn 190 degrees without moving the mouse, it can sometimes be the death of you. The story is another selling point, it's like playing a really good steven king book, it's suspenseful and has a very satisfying ending, great characters, one in particular is Alan's best friend and offers great comedic relief that isn't too much to hurt the games serious vibe. All of the characters are fantastic and the dialogue is always engaging, expect twist and turns by the end of each chapter. The game took me about 11 hours to finish minus the included special chapters that are included as free dlc, the free dlc is roughly 2 and a half hours long and is my biggest disappointment with the game, it's unnecessary and doesn't add much. i cant praise this one enough, just give it a try.

The gameplay is very addicted where the light is your bestfriend. The maps are kind of open-world where you can go on foot or by car.

 Alan Wake Review I bought the Alan Wake Complete pack somewhere around 2011 and 2012, after seeing it at the G4 E3 broadcast and on X-Play, both now extinct. I wanted it so bad, but after seeing it was only for the XBOX, I forgot about it after a while. When I first joined Steam in 2010*, I wanted to buy a game to get full Steam features. After about a year, Sam & Max Seasons 1-3 were on sale, so I bought them. But in the process I saw Alan Wake, which at the moment hadn't sparked any memory of it. For around a year I waited to buy it, and when I saw it was on sale along with Alan Wake's American Nightmare, I had to buy it. Since then it has become and stayed my favorite game of all time, and that's saying something since I've played somewhere around 300-400 games, probably more. I'm going to keep this as un-biased as possible though. There may be spoilers. Alan Wake   Gameplay and StoryAs the story goes, Alan is a famous published author, writer of the Alex Casey novels, who has a severe case of writers block. Alan's wife, Alice Wake, takes Alan on a vacation to Bright Falls, a small town in the Pacific Northwest. Alan and his wife arrive at their lakeside cabin after Alan meets some locals at the Oh-Deer Diner, a cozy small town diner. Alan turns the power on for his wife, who is achluophobic, or has a fear of the dark. Alice calls Alan up to their room, and tells him to check the surprise she left in the study. When Alan opens the door, he finds his typewriter, and that his wife intended for him to come on this trip to get rid of his writers block. Alan get's very angry, and storms out of the cabin. This is where the game's story really starts. The power in the cabin turned off, and Alice screams. Alan yells her name hoping for a reply, and as he walks through the cabin, he finds the door to the dock open, and Alice drowning in the water of Mirror Lake. The game is played in a third-person view behind Alan. Alan narrates the game, also. There is a small selection of weapons, which consist of a  Colt Python ,  Orion Flare Gun ,  A Over & Under Shotgun ,  Winchester Model 1300 Defender* ,  Remington Model Seven CDL*  , and a  Model 7290 Flashbang Grenade* . The flashbang is sort of like an incinerating bomb to the enemies, called The Taken, which are composed of darkness. Usually you have to shine a flashlight on them to tear away the darkness, then shoot them. But with the flashbang, and the Flare Gun, you can insta-kill them. There are other items such as batteries, flashlights, and flares, which hold the Taken back a certain distance. Sadly, this game has no other features besides it's linear story mode and achievements. There is another Alan Wake game, Alan Wake's American Nightmare, but it has almost nothing to do with the story and is more of a shooter than a thriller. Remedy Entertainment stated that they have plans for an Alan Wake sequel, but Alan Wake wasn't financally succesful enough to start now, and they are going to finish their upcoming game, Quantum Break, first. I give this game a  9.5 out of 10  because of the ending, which was fine to an extent. I would recommend this to fiction writers and avid book readers alike.Thanks for reading this review,Def* I lost my other account when I forgot the password and had to make this one, hence the difference between dates on my account of when I made my account. In game the weapons are called Revolver instead of Python, Flare Gun instead of Orion Flare Gun, Shotgun instead of Over & Under Shotgun, Pump-Action Shotgun instead of Winchester Model 1300 Defender, Hunting Rifle instead of Remington Model Seven CDL, and Flashbang instead of Model 7290 Flashbang Grenade.

												I wanted to play this game for a long while but was afraid to spend $30 on it so I waited for it to go on sale. After playing all the way through the game I realized that this game is worth every penny and more of the regular price! It is one of the best games I have played in a long time. It would be very hard to touch upon everything that makes this game great, but I will hit a few of the area that really stood out to me in my playthrough.Pros~The story will draw you in, intrigue you and makes you want to figure out what is going on. It unfolds like no other game I      have ever played and it is a thing of beauty.~The environment is beautiful and often terrifying ~The characters are great! They are funny, scary, emotional, believable and relevant! You really begin to care abot them.~The soundtrack is AMAZING! It could not be any better for this game.~The voice acting is top notch~The controls scheme is very unique and very fun once you get the hang out it.~It feels like true survival. You constantly feel like it is a fight for your life that you are losing.~Exploration is encouraged and often rewarding.~Night Springs, television, and the radio!... okay I could keep going with the pros all day, so let's get to the cons...Cons~The fight sequences are fun, but still become tedious after a while due to their abundance.~They are few and far between, but few parts of the game become trial and error, which can become frusterating fast.~The game is often creepy, but not truely scary. Unless you are afraid of the dark that is.VerdictThis is an amazing game. It has an amazing story, amazing character, an amazing soundrack; pretty much everything about this game is amazing. It feels like true survival and it encourages exploring. There is so much that is good about this game it is hard to touch on it all, but there are few things that hold this game from being perfect. The fights are repetative and can become annoying after a while. Some parts focused on purely surviving can be more trial and error. The game us not truely scary, but that is not a true hinderance. Overall it is one of the best games I have played in a long time.--Rating--    9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game that is well worth your time. The setting is great (very Twin Peaks) and the whole feel of the game is that of quality. The story and the characters are interesting and the gameplay mechanics are fun and satisfying.It can be quite challenging at times, but nothing crazy or punishing (like Dark Souls for example). If you enjoy story based, 3rd person action/horror/adventure games, you will likely love this game. It is one of the best 3rd person games that I have played and I really hope that they make a sequel at some point, as it would be a shame for them not to.The American Nightmare spin-off game isn't bad either, but it isn't as good as the main game. It's more action based and a lot smaller. It's still quite clever and enjoyable though.This one is definitely recommended though. Loved it.Just to add. The game is very well optimised and will run on fairly modest machines (by today's standards) at 1080p and the highest settings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After completing the game I feel very satisfied. I was impressed by the story! The voice actor Matthew Porretta was a really good choice! Nice graphics, amazing effects. Every little detail let you feel to be part of the story. In every chapter creators came with something new and exciting to make Alan Wake fun to play! (My favourite is the badass rock concert action!) And more! The episodes end with ending songs from several artists.What I didn't like about the game and only because it made no sense.. I don't understand why Alan always didn't take his weapons and flashlight to the next episodes.. It's not a big deal, because he always found it very soon somewhere nearby. But it doesn't make any sense. Why would you go to fight darkness not prepared at all? Why would you relly on a presumption it will be somewhere around..?I would also like to mention that Alan Wake contains 6 episodes + 2 additional ones. Be aware they will not start automatically even if you own them.. You have to start each of them from the menu. Episodes - choose difficulty - choose episode.I played the game on normal difficulty. Some parts in the beginning seemed quite difficult to me. Alan do not have much ammunition that's true.. It can become a bit frustrating. I would recommend to focus on what it tells you to do. Most of the time it's not about killing all Taken around, it's about surving, escaping, dodging, about tactics.. Some missions are about surviving the assault but then you will have unlimited ammunition nearby. So don't worry, pick up the flash light and run for your life!			",252,57,1,14,4,1,0

												I tried.  I honest-to-God, really, REALLY tried to like this game, twice, but I can't.  I just can't.  Everywhere I see, this game has nothing but positive reviews, and I'm honestly wondering if Steam somehow pranked me into giving me a version from an alternate reality in which the game was bad.Alan Wake is a supernatural-themed game from the makers of Max Payne, dealing with the subject of dreams and darkness.  It tells the story of a writer named Alan Wake (get it?  A. Wake?  GET IT?!?), who suffers from writer's block so he goes on vacation with his wife to try and find some peace, but it turns out it's all just an excuse for her to try to give him some inspiration.  His wife, who suffers from fear of darkness, and apparently lives in a world where therapy doesn't exist, gets kidnapped by an unseen force and Alan wakes (tee hee) missing a week and finding the line between reality and fiction blurred, as he's suddenly haunted by people who are vulnerable to light and finds scattered pages he doesn't remember having written literally laying out the plot of the game for him.Now, I realize I made the game sound far more interesting than it actually is.  The game itself is REALLY dull, and it suffers from a personality disorder.  It's not sure if it wants to be a graphic adventure, a shooter, a survival horror or an interactive movie.  And instead of focusing on a genre and developing it, it half-asses all of them.  The graphic adventure part is slow and cumbersome, because Alan handles like molasses, with nary a puzzle in sight.  The shooter part is annoying because the only way to defeat enemies is by shining a flashlight on them to turn them vulnerable before shooting them.  You'll recognize this as ""shooting, only slightly more annoying"".  There's nothing clever about this mechanic, and you'd get the same result by having guns with smaller magazines, so you'd have to see the reloading animation more often.  Also, sometimes you're forced to run from enemies, but either Alan suffers from asthma or he's a wimp, because he runs for a couple of seconds and he already can't take it anymore.  Hell, *I* suffer from ashtma, and I can run longer without getting tired.The survival horror part is dead because this game's ""horror"" depends exclusively on jump scares, and we should all stop pretending surprise is the same as terror.  Also, children and Alan's wife believe darkness is scary, but other people don't.  At least not when the game botches is so early by showing all its cards right from the beginning.  And then there's the interactive movie part.  I tried to play this game close at launch and now, and I don't remember having ever be impressed by its ridiculous facial animations, so I don't think it's a problem of holding up.  They were always blow-up-doll-like laughable.  And technology is not the problem, the Playstation 2 could easily handle facial expressions much better.  But the real problem are the story, which is full of cliches, and the characters, who range from ""meh"" to unlikable.  Specially the main character, whose story arc seems to actually be going from one to the other, in that order.  This has nothing, though, on the fact that the plot is constantly spoiled literally minutes before it happens because of those manuscript pages.  Who thought that was anything even close to a good idea?I'm leaving the game now, for good.  If memory serves right, it will be at pretty much the same point I left it the first time I tried to play it.  Maybe it gets better later, but when a game can't ever pique my interest after more than an hour of playtime, I call it a lost cause.  I play games for instant entertainment, I have real life for when I want to slog through boredom to get to the good stuff.  According to other reviews, gameplay never changes, so I'm confident that I'm making the right decision.  I honestly don't get it.  Is everyone liking this game ironically?  Will I ever make someone's life so miserable that they'll go back in time to make this game just to annoy me?  I mean, I understand why people like other games I don't like, but this one is legitimately puzzling me, and probably not the way the developers intended.			",363,91,15,23,28,1,47

												Alan Wake has great atmosphere, story and interesting game mechanics. The game has a theme revolving around darkness and light, and to fight enemies you must first blast them with your torch/other light source. This leads to plenty of interesting scenarios with lampposts etc.The main character, Alan Wake, is a writer, and fittingly the story is written well. The game seems to focus more on the story than gameplay (which can get a bit repetitive), and does well for it. There are plenty of cliches along the way, but overall it's incredibly solid with a great ending. Definitely give it a playthrough. Don't bother with the DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had this on my wishlist for sometime now, when it went on sale for the 2013 christmas holiday @ $3.50 for the Collector's Edition, I couldn't pass it up. I really enjoyed playing this game, I am a hardcore fps gamer, but not a huge fan of 3rd person, although I didn't mind at all when playing Alan Wake. Alan Wake has a good feel to it, a bit creepy when running around the forest and enemies appear! I love the concept of the light. Standing in light protects you from enemies and you must point and boost your flashlight onto enemies before shooting them. You can use flares, flaregun and flashbangs along with a pistol, two different shotguns and hunting rifle.There are a lot of hidden items through-out the forest you must collect.Also comes with steam trading cards and plenty of achievements! Check out more on the game if your interested!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What better way to experience a thriller, than play the main character? Alan Wake is the story of a man living on the edge, an adventurous writer who ultimately suffers the same fate as the characters in his stories. The immersion and detail given to the story more than makes up for the repetitive scenery and backtracking, and will leave you on the edge of your seat each time you enter combat; this is a must buy purely for the story.

												Alan Wake is a story-driven phychological thriller with one of the best plot in the genre. You play as Alan Wake, a burnt out writer who visits the small town of Bright Falls with his wife, Alice, for inspiration for his upcoming book called 'The Departure'. After the first night in Bright Falls, Alice is gone missing under mysterious circumstances, and Alan suddenly finds himself in the story of his unfinished horror novel. In order to save his wife, Alan needs to finish the story and find out of the dark secret of Bright Falls.The game is divided into 6 base episodes and 2 extra episodes, each starting with a short recap of the events of the previous one (except for the first episode of course.)During the span of the episodes, the story slowly unfolds, and the pieces of puzzle come together to form an outstanding plot.So, is Alan Wake worth playing? Yes, it is. Definitely but only for the story.Gameplay wise sadly it's one of the laziest work I've ever seen, there's zero effort in building tension past episode 2. All you get is cheap jump scares and massive hordes of enemies.And after a while you realize that the game only brings frustration and makes you angry, yet the plot is so good you will keep going just to get to the end of the story.PROS:- Graphics look pretty neat, especially the lighting and the landscapes.- The story! I can't emphasize this enough, the biggest value of the game is the story!- The lore and characters. The developers put a lot of details into the world of Alan Wake!- Radio shows, manuscripts further extends the knowledge of the plot.- Night Springs. An in-game TV show that's inspired by Twilight Zone.CONS:- Gameplay is a trainwreck!- Massive hordes of enemies ruin the tension and atmosphere. It also causes frustration and anger.- Alan Wake's stamina is lower than a 80 year grandpa who's been shot with a tranquilizer. Translation: he can't more than 10-15meters without being completely exhausted. I know the game is supposed to be a survival game, but come on!- The gameplay gets extremely repetitive and predictable at a certain point: see a barrel, or a broken down car? 99% they are poltergeist objects and will jump on you. See a generator that you need to restart? You will get swarmed by enemies as soon as you go near it.- Despite having collectibles and hidden items, the game does NOT like you wandering off the linear passage and often punishes you with waves of enemies.TLDR: Play Alan Wake for the story!

												I am writing this review about 6 hours into the game, and I'm out. I can't finish it. I've been enjoying the story. Visually, it's very well done. The gameplay is just monotonous and awful.You run through the woods at night with a gun (if you're lucky) and a flashlight. You face one enemy over and over again. They only make it harder by making it unfair. They just throw more of that one enemy at you at a time. I finally gave up on the game when two of them materialized 6"" away from me and killed me before I knew what was happening. The basic combat mechanic is that you use the flashlight to burn the evil off the enemies and then you can shoot them. This leads to ""holy crap... aim the flashlight... WAIT A WHILE... shoot,"" which really creates a weird rhythm when you're trying not to be killed by ghosts with axes. The flashlight has a button, that I've never seen on a flashlight before, that makes it way brighter, but kills the ENERGIZER batteries in seconds. In fact, you spend so much time in this game replacing dead batteries, I don't understand how Energizer thought this particular product placement deal was going to help them. It makes me want to buy Duracell.For those who really like collecting things, there are also thermoses you can pick up throughout the game, but I have no idea why. They are not discussed. So, as I said, I'm out. I hope Alan finds his wife, but I can't be the one to help him do it. I simply cannot bear another 7+ hours of this repetitive combat. What I really want is just a video of someone playing the game, with all the combat edited out. That wouldn't suck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The light fantastic (almost)Credit is due Remedy for making ALAN WAKE a story-driven game. It’s a partial success, though not a complete one. They have entirely eschewed the typical RPG tropes of dialogue trees and progression choices in favour of a linear, non-interactive structure. The story is played out in a series of cut-scenes and simple A to B tasks. Basically you just have to battle your way from one place to the next. There’s certainly a place for this type of game, and when it’s done well (á la Half-Life 2) it can be very rewarding. Unlike Half-Life 2, however, ALAN WAKE doesn’t quite pull it off. Firstly, there isn’t enough humour. There’s some but it would have benefited from more. And the story isn’t exactly original. But the main problem for me was the combat. I hated the way control is wrenched away from the player every time enemies approach. I get why they did it (there’s no other way of knowing they’re coming, apart from some audible warnings) but I often found myself disoriented when the camera had finished sweeping around and control had retuned. Several times the sweep lasted so long that by the time I had control again the enemies were right on me and it was impossible to avoid taking a hit. Frustrating to say the least. On the plus side the environments look very good and it’s quite atmospheric (although not as creepy as I would have liked – Silent Hill still sets the bar for that). One other thing worth noting is that I found the special episode, The Writer, to be better than what had gone before. It’s even more atmospheric and far more inventive. Overall this is a good game if not an outstanding one.3/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First, a fair warning to those who suffer from motion sickness: this game may affect you. The FOV is weird, the camera is too quick to react to input and motion is not linear. The worst of all are the driving sequences where all hell breaks loose.As for the game...This has to be the most realistic game I've ever played: Alan can't run, Alan can't jump, Alan can't aim, Alan doesn't plan ahead and keeps losing his weapons, Alan is booring, Alan keeps getting into trouble.Then there's the other side, the unrealistic side where the game keeps spawning enemies just for dificulty sake, where you are punished for exploring, where AI is given an unfair advantage, where you only have the ONE path.All that make this game very boring and the ""It's a horror genre game"" excuse doesn't cut it.I was ready to ditch this game by hour 3 but after so many ""It get's better later on"" comments, I've completed the game and I can say: THAT'S A COMPLETE LIE! The game only get's more frustrating as it progresses.Try the demo to see if you like it first, but I can't recommen this game. It's just too frustrating, especially coming from Rockstar.

												Just completed the Alan Wake experience. I say experience because it was an imersion in movie, novel and game.It places emphasis on the most important thing a lot of games these days are lacking: a good story. This story was told in a way that spared no expense in quality. From the atmosphere, to the sound track that includes well known artists, to the detail of graphics and textures. The importance of the way light and lighting was used in the graphics and story sets this game apart.It has well developed characters, stories within stories that aren't boring and epic, well directed cut scenes all set in a picturesque, haunting environment. A mixture of the best bits of Silent Hill, Telltale's Walking Dead, Skyrim and Resident Evil. A brilliant work of art. I think the only thing that let it down was the marketing and publicity as if it had of been promoted more, I would have got to it sooner.			",211,13,0,27,14,4,43

												The game has absolutely stunning visuals, a very full and well developed atmosphere, and a story that I found to be truly enthralling, all accompanied by a solid narrative and interesting storytelling. So, all of this considered, why do I not recommend this game? While enjoying the atmosphere, trying to focus on the beautiful visuals, and contemplating the artfully crafted thriller-narrative being unravelled as I play, the last thing I want to do is be subjected to relentlessly spawning mobs of 3-5 of the same uninspired enemy every 10 seconds. Especially when each individual enemy in these  mobs takes 5+ seconds of shining a boosted flashlight on him and a minimum of 3 shots from a six shot revolver to be defeated, all while the other guys batter you with axes.I am not wanting to take away from the fact that the combat was well inspired and tried to do something new, because it definitely did. You don't just blast away at whatever appears out of thin air until it falls lifeless: there is a method to the mayhem... but this doesn't change the fact that the combat is repetitive, time-consuming, clunky, and more a of a distraction than a benefit to an otherwise great game. Another viable alternative would have been the Mirror's Edge route: making it possible to avoid combat entirely. With some refinements to the dodge system and making it so you no longer run like a midget with one normal sized leg, you could actually run from that which terrifies you and this game would really feel a lot more like a thriller/horror game.Sadly, the combat was actually bad enough that I had to stop playing one episode from the end... even in light of all the great things it had going for it. Though I will definitely be finding a playthrough online to give me some closure on the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake tells a rich story in a great game. Its great to explore this world and to venture deeper in. It can be a bit scary at times, but never like Amnesia. The combat can be a bit tedious, unfortunately (and ammunition is scarce), but American Nightmare, the semi-sequel, does it a lot better. That game is great too, just quite short (3-4 hours, the main game has 10-15 depending on your playstyle: there is much to explore and collect apart from the obvious path)Also, the PC versions are very well made.

												Alan Wake was my favorite game for a few years after its initial release in 2010 and the steam version came out a couple years later after I had already played the game several times on my old 360. Fast-forward to 2016 and I'm starting a let's play channel, what better way to start out then with a game I remembered being so good? The steam version did not disappoint, the upscale of graphics on the pc is just enough to carry over the wonderful atmosphere. Alan Wake has an intriguing storyline, plenty of action, and full controller support is always a major plus.I would recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it before and tell those who did play it back in the day to try it out on pc!Also, if anyone is interested in seeing the game on an upscale pc and watch me play feel free to check out my Let's Play channel.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLClcLKYVu5AoeDkLARSZN5fIrk6l1jBYv ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is less a horror game and more of a story experience. The horror aspects are all but lost unless you are playing on the hardest difficulty, which takes two or three playthroughs to unlock, and the difference is palpable. On anything but nightmare mode, a shadowy man will pop out on occasion and after going shine shine shine, glack glack glack, the threat is gone and you can continue with the story. On nightmare mode the game is completely different. Hordes of shadowy abominations of our reality will pour from the woods while you desperately sprint towards the next pinprick of light only to have it wink out as you near it. Then you pop a flare and continue the full tilt sprint to the next shining becon of hope, only for Wake to get tired and then get an axe in the back of his head.Nightmare mode seems to be the way the game was MEANT to be played, but you can't access it without 2 other plythroughs, which is simply asking too much. Personally I play through a game once and am done with it unless theres some crazy alternate endings that I HAVE to get, wich there aren't here. Which brings me to the story. Alan Wake's story is a cross between Stephen King and Twin Peaks, with a heavy dose of lovecraft mixed in. I will not spoil anything in this, but the story is truly the best aspect of this game. It keeps the player thinking about what will happen next and where this♥♥♥♥♥♥storm of nightmares will end up. In the end, Alan Wake is not a particularly scary game, unless played on the highest difficulty. The story and immersion are it's strong points, but one playthrough is probably enough, unless you are a completionist, then this game has plenty for you in the forms of thermoses scattered around the playing areas. This game is a definite 8/10, nothing♥♥♥♥♥♥your-pants amazing, but still enough that everyone should play it one time through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a prime example of what I like in a ""horror"" game. I have purchased and played Outlast, Amnesia, Dead Space... none of them hit home for me. Alan Wake, as opposed to other horror titles, doesn't rely on gore or jump scares to create a sense of eerieness. This game is INCREDIBLY atmospheric and thought out. While it has good scares (that whole part with Stucky, for example. Still makes me shiver.) it's so much more. It's a game about good vs. evil, a kidnapped love, and a town's secret mystery. A lot of the reviews say that it would make a fantastic movie or book, and I agree. Alan Wake utilizes atmosphere and mysetry to subtlely create a downright creepy game. And, I love it.

												Okay, are you afraid of darkness? In this game you can punch it in a face (not literally, tho).Aside from being nice psychological drama and very cinematographique experience, Alan Wake is a nice action which can keep you on your toes most of the time. Graphics are pretty, considering this game's age, and you can really get some satisfaction from being in the woods, surrounded by weird stuff trying to kill you. Anyway, if you still haven't played this game - you missed a good stuff. PC-port of this game is pretty good, so don't hesitate (if you do, otherwise why in the world would you read this) to buy it anytime. But if you low on money, you can just wait for a sale - discount for this game is so great, that I felt kind of guilty, when I bought a game this great for less than a dollar. It worth much more.I strongly recommend this XBOX360-hit to anyone, who approaches it for any reason.

If you are a fan of said series and appreciate a good mystery / psycological thriller where the story and characters are at the center, rather than ""popup in your face""-scary kind of stuff, I highly recommend this game.The game plays like a good tv-series or a novel, and the in-game episodes, complete with end music really emphasize this feeling.

												Alan Wake is a truly underrated and sadly ignored game which did not receive the kind of attention it deserves. This game is not perfect, but it still does most everything right to the smallest detail, in the most original and creative of ways. First off, the atmosphere is absurdly engaging, realistic, absorbing, and scary. The lighting engine especially in this game is better than any game I've seen so far. Which makes sense, considering how essential the lighting mechanics are for this game. What people say is correct - it is literally like playing through/experiencing a Stephen King novel. It is wonderfully cinematographic, during gameplay and in the cutscenes. Plus the voice acting is top notch, perfect attention was given to sound details and animations, and the story is really well paced. The story and the game's atmosphere keeps you on your toes the entire time, with unpredictable plot progression and developments, and a twisting, deep, surprise-filled story.Speaking of tension, this is one of the few games that actually makes you address each battle scenario strategically (A few others being Bioshock, Borderlands, etc.). You are so scarce on ammo and flashlight batteries throughout most of the game, that you start to bug out when you are running out of ammo, and the enemies keep spawning anyway, as if they thought you were Rambo or something. You scour every area of the map looking for any bits of ammo you can find. Each enemy takes so much work to kill that it can easily get overwhelming and you can quickly use up your ammo.The game implements some pretty crafty platforming and environmental puzzles, particularly in the The Writer DLC. Albeit short, I greatly enjoyed that DLC  because it was just pure creativity, from beginning to end. I did not enjoy the The Signal DLC as much, but it was still good. That one felt too repetitive and eventually got quite frustrating, but it still had creative content and impressive technical feats.You get plenty of gametime out of this game - 11-14 hours for the main story alone. And then 1.5 hours for each of the DLC, and also however much time goes into finding all the hidden objects spread throughout the levels, if you are into that kind of thing.So in summary, with a fantastic, original, well-paced, complex, non-cliche and creative story, a very impressive game engine that looks absolutely gorgeous a LOT of the time (I took 175 screenshots in my single playthrough. :D), solid shooting mechanics, nice attention to detail, a consistently frightening and tense environment, and excellent level design, this is a game I would HIGHLY recommend, to anyone who feels they can handle a psychological horror game of this degree.

												Not many people on my friends list appear to have played this (or played it on the couch instead hurr) but I have to say I genuinely like this game. The combat isn't spectacular and can be a little frustrating at times, but the atmosphere is nigh on perfect. The story is like a hackneyed mix of silent hill, jacobs ladder, and the author stephen king tossed into a blender and is surprisingly good. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play that scratches that ""survival horror narrative"" itch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a game that begins with the letter ""A"", Alan Wake is constantly eluding my vision as I scroll up and down my Steam Library. Sometimes I forget I own it, and when I remember, I have to convince myself that I actually played it. When the memories all come back, Alan Wake slams me in the face and forces me to look down at that towering list of games it stands above, not only because it is alphabetically superior, but outwardly superior as well.The narrative is so tight, so well-woven that it breathes in and out, heaves spit in your face, and so humid you can taste the ripe Stephen King inspiration on the tip of your lower lip, unless your lower lip decides to fall open for the mind-blowing finale and your mouth becomes vulnerable to the sweet juiciness it leaves on your tongue. Seldom can games be described as such.However, I forget this fact. There it is, standing on a heap of otherwise sub-par games, escaping the ""Top 10"" lists I like to think up in my head, when it should be modeling at the forefront of story design for future games. The point is that it wasn't a wholly memorable experience. I really hate to admit this, considering how powerful a game it was in scope and atmosphere, but the game itself plays like a Stephen King novel: a single-dose experience that will likely be temporarily surpassed until it can come rushing back to your tongue. It's difficult that way. There's no dishonor in this; if anything, Alan Wake acts like a reality check, like a list of criteria all games must now meet before they can be truly commended for the features they present. Oftentimes I will come back and make sure I don't go overboard about loving a certain game until I pay my tithe to the king of all, if only a spiritual one: Alan Wake.Buy it on a sale. Don't promise yourself to replay it, because you won't, but it offers an array of emotions that can rarely be captured. You won't ever fully appreciate how great it is, but that's okay, because it's still going to give you an impression you will HATE to see another games attempt to imitate.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing! It's like watching a movie. It has fun novel and films' references, along with a dense history and plot twists that leave you breathless (at least, I've felt that way). I do not consider it as a Survival Horror (there were some tense moments, but it is not something that can traumatize you), but is equally rewarding. You may get attached to many of the characters. Honestly, I desperately recommend it. I feel it's worthy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When you use aim that flashlight on those guys and there's that sizzling sound, following a bang, as they become vulnerable to your bullets, and they you shoot them, and there's a slight slow down as you FEEL that you killed them. So satisfying, man... It would take a lot to make me get tired of doing that  over and over again. Well, it does, now and then.The best part of the game is the pages. They're scattered through the game, and seem to tell peculiar stories pertaining to your own. It's worth collecting every one of them and reading them. They can be funny, sad, shocking. And my favorite are the ones that really screwed with your mind.This game should have a demo because I'm confident you're going to love the ending of the first ""episode"". The camera work and the transition into the music...epic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												♥♥♥♥in' fanstasic, but only when on sale as the game is rather short.

You may scream at your computer for a few moments in frustraion because of it. In short, get it when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playing like a video game version of twin peaks. This third person horror game manages to tease you along a very lovecraftian story. Every chapter of the game winds the mystery and confusion of this universe further. The ride is worth it if you dig the kind of cosmic horror stuff.Combat is solid, if not basic. The one flaw in this game has to be the driving segments, mercifully spread out and brief when utilized.Still one of my favorite games. The DLC/standalone story is also pretty great.

It helped tidy up a couple of narrative threads that left me wanting more at the end of this game.  Also, it's good game in its own right.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The mechanics based on the power of light vs. darkness are interesting and fun to play with. Ammo is rare so you will sometimes feel helpless in this obscure environnment, and it's in these moments that Alan Wake succeed the most.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Genre: 3rd person shooter, thriller, action, dramaMy Opinion: B+Length: ~10hoursReplay: LowIts a 3rd person suspense thiller shooter. The game's visuals are great and there are some really scenic areas in the game, along with well done models and textures for the time. The only things that were not top notch were the combat, and the driving. The combat was slightly clunky, along with the ability to basically dodge out of the way of pretty much any attack, and the driving was just insufferable, since the cars would break down far too often since they get damaged when you run into enemies.Overall, its a fun game, worth taking a look at if you are ok with 3rd person shooters, not anything super exceptional, since the story is pretty bog standard for a suspense thriller, where it feels like a typical Stephen King novel.

												NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. It is a shame I have to put up these notes telling people what they should already know on to do their own, but due to inflammatory commentry, I do.A game much different than anything I ever played. The best way to describe the game is a survival horror done int he way of an interactive short tv series with an overlying narrative like that of a visualized book. The gameplay is magnificent and controls are at times a bit extensive but easy to get used to. It's very environmentally interactive and nearly as realistic and logical as a game can get. This game is fun in terms of reading a good mystery novel, only you're in control and replace the need to read text, there are stunning visuals, haunting melodies, and the goal to help you, Alan wake, discover what is reality and what is fiction, if reality still even exists. Writers truly get lost in their work...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just simply amazing. From the start you are dropped into a wonderful world of darkness and shot into the fray of battle in the night. The game play is Extraordinary, except in the case of thin pathways, in which it may be hard to angle the screen correctly. The story is one of the best I have played in YEARS. It has an atmosphere of creepiness that I have rarely seen so perfectly executed. It is well worth your money, especially if you enjoy Psycological thrillers, search and finds, and spooky shoot em' ups. Long story short, it is a phenomenal game that will take hours upon hours to 100%. And in this era of Shooter games, it is a fresh breath of air for all of us casual, and hardcore gamers out there.                                                                                     94/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: Evokes Stephen King. Lightsource/gun combat is well-done. Works as a psychological thriller(not horror) with supernatural aspects. Challenging. Fast-paced, gripping story. Beautiful graphics - what's quaint one moment can be creepy the next. Does for the King novel what Max Payne did for film noir and John Woo.Cons: Short. Linear. Only combat offers challenge - puzzles and finding your way are easy.My recommendation: a must for even casual King fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best survival horror game you never heard of.  Unlike the cliche of most horror games, you are certainly not defenseless.  At the same time though, your character definitely feels like the everyman who is fighting for his life against the supernatural.  A great story, plenty of action, and excellent controls (bonus points for being in a genre filled with games that have poor controls) make this an experience you may not have heard of, but you MUST try.

												There are not many games, I'd recommend to others after I played it just ~1 hour, but Alan Wake is definitely one of them. It's scary, it has a good story (yet), nice graphics (even Watch Dogs looks worse imho...), nice gameplay (3rd person>1st person (at least in singleplayer games)), and a very great narrative style to convey the story.I don't know what to say... get it or miss a good game.

												If Twin Peaks was 100x more terrifying and had a ripoff Joe Pesci it would be called Alan Wake. This game is a lot of fun and the story is a weird mix of insanity, horror, and humor. Definitely worth it for the price it goes on sale for all the time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A beautiful game with a thrilling and original story, featuring unique gameplay that defines this game as an amazing atmospheric third-person shooter. Come for the gameplay, stay for the beautiful story that will leave you wanting more.The visuals themself are stunning. I played through this game on low quality and it was one of the most visually awe-inspiring sceneries I'd ever seen.The gameplay is unique and flows along greatly. The unique gameplay makes for some new shooting experiences, whether you're shooting with a flashlight or a revolver in hand.The story is perhaps the best part of the game. It's emotional, with excellent twists and turns and a unique plot unlike the 'This is invaded by darkness, save it.' plot. The genre is always changing, from getting into action into a horror story (or at least a creepy game). Ever-changing.The soundtrack is beautiful as well, listening to it through the Collector's Edition revealed that to me.Well, what are you waiting for? Buy this masterpiece!			",201,21,1,18,8,3,4

												Afraid of the dark? You will be...Simply Superb!The game is broken up into multiple episodes themed like a TV mini-series. Oddly enough, this works really well and is a handy cue to take a break.The only thing that lets this game down are the in your face achievements and deficient character control (mainly when jumping). These moments detract/distract from the flowing tension and should have been excluded or improved upon. Nevertheless, the hand of a professional writer is obvious and the game really shines for it.Story = 11/10Gameplay = 8/10Bonus = Excellent use of lighting +0.5Bonus = Surround gaming supported +0.5Total = 10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake was my favorite game for a few years after its initial release in 2010 and the steam version came out a couple years later after I had already played the game several times on my old 360. Fast-forward to 2016 and I'm starting a let's play channel, what better way to start out then with a game I remembered being so good? The steam version did not disappoint, the upscale of graphics on the pc is just enough to carry over the wonderful atmosphere. Alan Wake has an intriguing storyline, plenty of action, and full controller support is always a major plus.I would recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it before and tell those who did play it back in the day to try it out on pc!Also, if anyone is interested in seeing the game on an upscale pc and watch me play feel free to check out my Let's Play channel.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLClcLKYVu5AoeDkLARSZN5fIrk6l1jBYv ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A rather unique title, Alan Wake sets you in a richhorror environment which - contrary to its genre - takes the bold turn to tell you the story before it happens. The combat, surprisingly for a third person game, is not set behind chest high walls in a whack-a-mole fashion. Instead you must run about with some rather clunky dodging skills and point a torch at things -then- fill them with bullets. The nature of the enemies presented makes them well suited to the genre but since bullets are nearly always in abundance their threat isnt all that great which diminishes their effects.While still entertaining to a degree, that its story really outranks its gameplay is a sign that it had a lot of thought and care put into it, the odd presentation in that the game is divided into chapters which each have an ending sequence quickly followed by a recap makes it seem it was written for a different medium - the tendency for each chapter to have a high tension ending followed by an unneeded stripping and debriefing to put the player into the next chapter is quite jarring.That said; the unconventional pre-warning of the story to the player is well thought out and - more importantly - well used. While the player may learn what will happen, its never said how or why or (in cases) when. By loosely leading the story like this it creates anticipation as well as a foggy conclusion which works just right, adding a slight overarching mystery affair.Also, as a protagonist, Alan is a pretty big♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not Nathan Drake cuntish, but still nearing that.

The dense plot, the atmosphere, the engaging gameplay and the fantastic soundtrack all come together to make this something you'll remember for years to come.

												Alan Wake - Purchased for $3.99  This one was a rollercoaster for me. I really wanted to love this game but the gameplay holds it back. I really dug the feeling, setting, and storytelling in this game. It was dark and mysterious and I liked the way each chapter ended with credits and had a 'next time on Alan Wake'. They tried to make you feel like you were acting out a novel and it worked for me. Unfortunately, the gameplay while initially interesting wears off and becomes mundane. It's a run from A to B and kill some guys on the way type of game. Over, and over, and over...""Get to the gas station"", ""get to the lighthouse"", ""get to the farm"". If I hear Alan Wake say ""I had to get to the..."" one more time!  If you don't think you can overlook the flaws in the gameplay stay away. If you dig the vibe of this game consider it but wait for a good sale. A very cautious recommendation.			",36,22,0,0,3,0,4

												By far one of the greatest psychological horror games i have ever played... If not the best.. (feel free to recommend some)This game pulls off something great. The fear of night, and the appreciation of daylight. Finally completing a session, making it to the end of one night, being relieved, but PUSHED into another right after.This i think is great. Why? Well i am glad you asked ;)))In most other ""horror"" games: MonstrumSlender(The full game)Slender: Eight pagesJust to name a few, its one big stretch... There is no safe haven.This is one of those games, that will leave you sitting in awe.8/10-2 for NO replayability. But thats to be expected.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It starts out VERY ambient and very impressive, but it kind of limits itself to the recurring theme of ""dark woods and abandoned facilities in dark woods"" which can get a bit old...but it does spice it up more towards the end.The main element of light and dark is VERY well done in game mechanics.  The flashlight, flares, and other things are VERY bright and the fog-like darkness is pretty obtrusive and forboding.  That being said, the heavy detail on the lights can make most PCs chug a bit.Also there is a scene in which you fight off hordes of baddies while rocking out to viking metal.  THAT ALONE SHOULD SELL YOU THIS GAME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While some parts can be annoyingly frustrating (especially when you CAN'T SEE ANYTHING GAAAAH LIGHTING), it really is a nice little game that's an obvious homage to Stephen King and David Lynch's bodies of work. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing as well! More of a psychological thriller than a straight up horror game, but it does use it's horror elements well. Fans of Silent Hill should enjoy this more than the more recent games in that sadly buried franchise. Give it a shot, hopefully you won't be too disappointed!			",604,246,19,88,47,3,47

												Being a game that begins with the letter ""A"", Alan Wake is constantly eluding my vision as I scroll up and down my Steam Library. Sometimes I forget I own it, and when I remember, I have to convince myself that I actually played it. When the memories all come back, Alan Wake slams me in the face and forces me to look down at that towering list of games it stands above, not only because it is alphabetically superior, but outwardly superior as well.The narrative is so tight, so well-woven that it breathes in and out, heaves spit in your face, and so humid you can taste the ripe Stephen King inspiration on the tip of your lower lip, unless your lower lip decides to fall open for the mind-blowing finale and your mouth becomes vulnerable to the sweet juiciness it leaves on your tongue. Seldom can games be described as such.However, I forget this fact. There it is, standing on a heap of otherwise sub-par games, escaping the ""Top 10"" lists I like to think up in my head, when it should be modeling at the forefront of story design for future games. The point is that it wasn't a wholly memorable experience. I really hate to admit this, considering how powerful a game it was in scope and atmosphere, but the game itself plays like a Stephen King novel: a single-dose experience that will likely be temporarily surpassed until it can come rushing back to your tongue. It's difficult that way. There's no dishonor in this; if anything, Alan Wake acts like a reality check, like a list of criteria all games must now meet before they can be truly commended for the features they present. Oftentimes I will come back and make sure I don't go overboard about loving a certain game until I pay my tithe to the king of all, if only a spiritual one: Alan Wake.Buy it on a sale. Don't promise yourself to replay it, because you won't, but it offers an array of emotions that can rarely be captured. You won't ever fully appreciate how great it is, but that's okay, because it's still going to give you an impression you will HATE to see another games attempt to imitate.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A brilliantly written game with a very spooky cinematic feel to it. Feels like the kind of game Stephen King would write if he was a game designer. (This was obviously the intention of the game's creators, as they refer to King from the get-go. :p)There's a nice deep mythology to the game involving Alan Wake as a writer and husband, the town of Bright Falls as a place in both past and present, as well as supernatural elements that have a way of bleeding through the gaps between fact and fiction. The game mechanics are fun, and the whole mysterious feel to the story keeps you coming back for more till it's all done. 5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game is a carefully crafted masterpiece.The characters are very well written, the gameplay is unique and challenging. On top of that the player is thrown in a dense and disturbing atmosphere similar to cinematic classics such as ""The Shining"".There are quite some ironic cultural references as well.Remedy did a great job by implementing a whole load of details featuring TV-Sequences, cutscenes that make actually sense, radio-sequences, and pages of a manuscript you are trapped in.The succesful fusion of Action and Story makes Alan Wake a more than just enjoyable game.People looking for a linear single-player shooter or a horror game like Amnesia won't like this game too much. Story and Gameplay are the keywords to describe the ""Alan Wake""-experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Waited years for the PC port while fighting off the urge to buy a console simply to play this one story-driven game. I both love and hate Stephen King, and love Twin Peaks wholeheartedly; luckily, AW goes above and beyond most all of King's output to deliver something entirely on another level, reaching more in the line of Ellis' underappreciated Glamora--god, this is getting obnoxious. Anyway, I loved it more than I expected. The pomo narrative selfconsciousness and general tomfoolery got me kickin'. The repetitive combat didn't so much, but I found myself always eager to look past that and see and hear Wake's next steps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an excellent horror game, made by the same producers of Max Payne. The game is good and has a great story, it's scary, a great horror game to play. You will definetly enjoy it, and don't waste time looking for a good horror game, just get this one!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far one of the most original and entertaining games I have ever played. Alan Wake effortlessly blends video games and thriller novels into a masterful ""page-turner"" that will keep you hooked until the credits roll. If you are a fan of great stories, atmospheric games, or refreshingly different gameplay, pick this one up. You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game and I think you should give it a try, spent 6 hours on it and I'm only on chapter 3 so I'd say it's worth the price but I got it on offer :P Although I have to say it gets alittle boring fighting dudes for the 100 time because you got lost and if you run out of ammo your ♥♥♥♥ed but besides that I'd say its one of my favourite games, Portal being my favourite.

												Waited years for the PC port while fighting off the urge to buy a console simply to play this one story-driven game. I both love and hate Stephen King, and love Twin Peaks wholeheartedly; luckily, AW goes above and beyond most all of King's output to deliver something entirely on another level, reaching more in the line of Ellis' underappreciated Glamora--god, this is getting obnoxious. Anyway, I loved it more than I expected. The pomo narrative selfconsciousness and general tomfoolery got me kickin'. The repetitive combat didn't so much, but I found myself always eager to look past that and see and hear Wake's next steps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those rare games where your imagination can be used to massively increase the gaming experience. Some here have described it as playing a Stephen King horror story and I have to agree. If you're a jaded player and go looking for faults, you'll find them in every game including this one, but the story driven gameplay is fantastic. Well that's my opinion.It is one of the most atmospheric games I've played and ranks in my small personal list of great games.Play alone, in the dark and with headphones. Engage your imagination and child-like fear of the dark, then feel your skin crawl as you play. Never did a lamp-post look so appealing. Enjoy.Note: For me, get the original and stick with it because the extra bonus levels and American nightmare just don't cut it at all. They don't have the same well written atmosphere to them and do nothing for the terrific ending of the first game.During the game listen to Alan Wakes' description of what makes a horror story feel real etc etc. If you get what he's saying then just stop at the end of the first game. When you think about it, it's a truly horrifying ending ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely loved this game, if there's one series that's brought me back to the silent hill era it's Alan wake (Yes series because of the expansions)..  Intense thriller story line that grips you from start to finish.  Stunning visuals and an interesting gameplay mechanic thrown in (The flashlight).  You'll never want to stop playing.So far I've beat it twice and it still never gets old.  There aren't many games that compell me to beat them once let alone another time.The downside to all this is that it's pretty linear.  I'm not speaking from my point of view on this one because I don't mind but some might find the on rails action a bit stale.  9/10 on graphics10/10 gameplay6/10 on replayability (Only because it's a total mind bender and I don't find games like these offer much in another playthrough...  Even though I beat it twice many may not want to brave the game for a second playthrough)			",114,18,4,8,7,1,23

												NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. It is a shame I have to put up these notes telling people what they should already know on to do their own, but due to inflammatory commentry, I do.A game much different than anything I ever played. The best way to describe the game is a survival horror done int he way of an interactive short tv series with an overlying narrative like that of a visualized book. The gameplay is magnificent and controls are at times a bit extensive but easy to get used to. It's very environmentally interactive and nearly as realistic and logical as a game can get. This game is fun in terms of reading a good mystery novel, only you're in control and replace the need to read text, there are stunning visuals, haunting melodies, and the goal to help you, Alan wake, discover what is reality and what is fiction, if reality still even exists. Writers truly get lost in their work...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best survival horror game you never heard of.  Unlike the cliche of most horror games, you are certainly not defenseless.  At the same time though, your character definitely feels like the everyman who is fighting for his life against the supernatural.  A great story, plenty of action, and excellent controls (bonus points for being in a genre filled with games that have poor controls) make this an experience you may not have heard of, but you MUST try.

												This game I had to get to grips with for it to grow on me. First I was recommended to try this game, and read many positive reviews so I thought this ought to be a good game. The first hour of playing I was thinking to myself, how on earth everybody loves this game so much. It was super linear, cinematics were not that convincing, voice acting was not superior, blocky geometry etc. The beginning was a bit of a let down for me. But man this game gets going like a virtual twin peaks once you perservere with it. I think my initial expectations were different since I had followed this game somewhat during it's development around 2006-2007 and back then it was supposed to be an open world game. But once this game gets going the linearity is a non issue for me anymore. On the contrary it's almost mandatory to keep the pacing of the game and it's story tight. Story and locations are very Twin Peaks like. This game will not be easy to understand because it was supposed to continue, so you have unanswered questions left. But so was twin peaks also, a lot of weird stuff just remained weird and that contributed to it's bizarre atmosphere that really was it's selling points.If you like bizarre suspenceful games, this should do it for you. It is a well made game. Even it does show signs of aging but gracefully so. Oh, and the voice acting that was a bit of a let down in the beginning for me, does improve and reaches a point where the story is told believably and fluently. I kind of wish Remedy would return to this and finish it off open world style one day. Great game even with it's change of direction and style from it's beginnings. And boy does this game have tons of surprises for a Remedy gaming fan..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: September 13, 2012
												Note: This game is polarizing and I will give my best ability to not give an unbiased review.What this game does right is captivating the audience into playing more. The game is set in an episodic story arc, weird for a video game, but Alan Wake pulls it off. It is not like The Walking Dead Episodic series, but instead each chapter is broken into the episodic format. At the beginning of each episode (excluding episode one) is a recap of the previous episode. If you are like me and you continue to play through the game, then the recap is not really needed, but it does keep the tone of the game. At times these recaps are helpful when it comes to remembering the plot or just returning back to the game. At the end of each episode, the credits roll and a song is playing. Once you skip or let the credits roll, the game will send you to the next episode. The story overall is fantastic and the game’s writers knew what they wanted for the game. These writers are famous for writing the first two Max Payne games, so the majority of the story is told through Alan Wake, the protagonist, as the narrator. The story is about Alan Wake, a successful writer who suffers from writer’s block. He and his wife, Alice, go to Bright Falls, where they vacation to clear Alan’s mind. Then in their stay, Alice is pulled into the darkness and it is up to Alan to save her. Along the way Alan discovers manuscripts of his work in progress, Departure which tells a chilling story of events, and Alan realizes that whatever is on these pages will happen in the real world. This short summary of what is to come in Alan Wake. The gameplay is a story of its own. The basic mechanics of Alan Wake are to get from point A to point B with enemies and puzzles to get in the way. Fighting enemies in this game are not in the traditional sense. The theme of Alan Wake is Darkness, and the ironically named Bright Falls is being taken over by the Darkness. The Darkness consumes people and Alan Wake has to shine light from his flashlight on his enemies to clear the Darkness from them before he can shoot and kill them. Not only does Alan Wake fight, but he has a dodging mechanic to where he ducks and weaves from his enemies that either attack or throw tools at him. This feature, like Max Payne’s shoot dodge, is used a lot to avoid enemies. Now what this game does poorly is its character expression during cut scenes. The character development is awesome and the models are great, but when the characters speak, their lips and face are awkward enough to question the games programming, but it is not so bad that it takes away from the experience of the game. Another complaint is the PC port has a couple of glitches when I played, but Remedy remedied that (lol). Also the gameplay to a certain degree is a bit tedious. The running from point A to point B while doing rendered the same actions over and over is a little bit redundant at times, but there is enough variety in between these segments to make it not boring. Ultimately, the story is what saved Alan Wake from being a generic third person game to being a great experience overall. The story is what keeps you playing; the story is what makes you care for the characters; the story is what drives the gameplay home. You cannot go wrong with purchasing this game.  Scale:Story 10/10*Writing, Pacing, and Voice actingGameplay: 8/10*Fun, but redundant to a pointGraphics 9/10*Fantastic landscapes and models, but glitches in talking and walking.Replay value: 8/10*Great, like watching a movie, and there are collectables.Effort: 9/10*The Designers took 5 years to make this, but the glitches is what makes it a 9._____________________________________________________________________________________Overall: 9*Rating Scale is based on the average of the 5 main categories and round to the nearest number.Thank You for reading first effortful review. Please let me know how I did.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What is Alan Wake? Summed up: Luigi's Mansion meets Twin Peaks meets Deadly Premonition and with a small serving of early '90s slasher/action flick on the side.For some of the flaws and missteps it takes, Alan Wake is an enjoyable experience, especially for those with a penchant for creative writing. The titular character, Alan, acts as an avatar of sorts for writers and players and for those inclined, both. He takes a vacation in the sleepy town of Bright Falls, located somewhere in the state of Washington. It is here he finds out - rather harshly - that there are dark forces at work, and with it, unveiling a mystery that engulfs the town.Don't be fooled, however; this is not a traditional horror game. It has more in common with action-adventure games such as Uncharted and Alone in the Dark 2 than it does with more cerebral games like Silent Hill and Sanitarium. The game plays with a behind the shoulder perspective and your crosshair, so to speak, is provided by a flashlight. Even so, the game controls rather well and Alan's movements and responsive and crisp. There are a few parts where the rather solid movement can make jumping from one platform to the next a little cumbersome, but those are a minor gripe. As for the graphics, they do the job. Often times, you can notice artifacts or little quirks, such as questionable facial animations, but if Fallout 4 can get a free pass for that, so can Alan Wake.The game's biggest flaw (outside of icy driving controls) is the fact that you cannot explore the town of Bright Falls, as the game is incredibly linear in its direction. You cannot hang out at a local joint like you can in Deadly Premonition or talk to random strangers and get a feel for the town. The reason why I note this is that the characters and dialogue, and by extension writing, are all quite wonderful. All the characters are vibrants with their quirks and personalities. A no-nonsense sheriff, a trigger-happy agent, a disturbingly unfettered doctor, they all stand out vividly. The gameplay itself is nothing to write home about, but it keeps you on your toes and some might find it repetitive at times. But the scenery and massive levels are more than enough to keep you engaged.[On that note, getting the game with the DLC is highly recommended. You get two full-length episodes (~2 hours of gameplay) that continue the story straight from the ending. They are quite fantastic and switch up the formula nicely.]Oh, and the soundtrack? ♥♥♥♥ing incredible.Conclusion: Get the game when it's on sale, you won't regret it.8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You may scream at your computer for a few moments in frustraion because of it. In short, get it when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is thrown on top of a vast, well-developed story to leave you wanting to play ""one more episode"", as if you were binge-watching a smart, tautly-written tv show.CANNOT. RECOMMEND. ENOUGH.

												Loved the narrative style, the gameplay is a bit repetitive and there are very few weapons to use, but the story and the way it develops makes up for that. It's a great game, a must play. On the graphical side, it's one hell of a good looking game, maybe not ground breaking but its got a lot of customizable graphic options, so it'll scale well with hardware. I played it on a Asus G75 notebook with a 660M (2GB) and didn't have performance issues, just some sttuter from time to time. Overall I'll give it a 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan wake a great game, your greatest weapon is the light, the game is scary at times but it really thrives at it's characters & storyline. I really enjoyed the tv show style they gave, breaking it off and giving an ""episode"" a climatic ending, which as real tv shows to, keeps you desiring for the next. The game is very atmospheric and lighting, as it needed to be, is amazing. Brilliant game 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												♥♥♥♥in' fanstasic, but only when on sale as the game is rather short.

You may scream at your computer for a few moments in frustraion because of it. In short, get it when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I sometimes have diffuculty playing a game all the way through. Even theough the gameplay is exciting and the bad guys are fun to shoot, it eventually begins to bore me. Alan Wake is the exact opposite of that. The bad guys are very fun to shoot and it's incredibly exciting, but there is a level of depth in this game that i have never experienced before. The storyline, the amazing landscapes and the intensity of all the events happening around you draw you into this game, and it is impossible to get out. I feel like I have actually been to Bright Falls, and Barry seems lika an actual friend of mine. This is (second to TF2) my favorite videogame i have ever played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are few developers that can put game, story and ambience to work so closely together as Remedy can. This is a Pulp-horror story, on a Twin Peaks style ambience, expect no other thing. On the downside, being essentially story driven, the mechanic could get a little repetitive... but we get more Poets of the Fall!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The reason i gave this game a thumbs up is because of the interesting story, It outweights the somewhat boring and repetitive gameplay.-----------------------------------------------Here is what i liked about the game:- Really interesting story- Overall unsettling atmosphere- Manuscripts you can pickup in the game (Basicly the story you're playing, but it's interesting to read)- Good graphics, not the best but good enough- A few intense momentsI really liked the story, one of the better i have heard in a long time in a video game. while it's not a completely scary horror game it's unsettling enough to creep you out from time to time. While i liked that you could pick up your manuscript pages, it also kind of revealed what would happen later in the game. While the forests sure looks beautiful with lots of details and textures that's good enough, you can't help but think ""Not another ♥♥♥♥ing forest"" later in the game. Ohterwise, the game gots graphics good enough to deliver. And there's a few key moments that was intense and really interesting i won't mention here for the sake of not spoiling it for anybody.-----------------------------------------------Now here is what i didn't like about the game:- Linear and repetitive gameplay- The same ghostmen over and over again (The variations is: Normal guys, Big guys and Fast guys)- It's pretty predictable to spot when you will get ambushedThe game pretty quickly becomes linear and repetitive since you have to follow a path in the game and kill the same ghostmen the same way over and over. There's a couple of ways to deal with them, but it quickly becomes the same and you quickly learn how to deal with certain types of enemies. also like i mentioned.. you will get tired of forests sooner or later. When you're through the first episode, you will probably already know when to expect company by your best friends, the ghostmen.-----------------------------------------------In the middle:- The ending- Coffee collectablesThe story itself was good, but the ending makes you think and i am still kind of lost. I still don't really know what the hell happened. (Maybe you'll get it) The coffee collectables... don't really know how i feel about them. They don't do anything and kind of feel out of place.The Verdict:All in all, a good game with an interesting and unsettling story, but i don't want to play it again because of the gameplay. The only reason to play it again would be to play Nightmare mode to get all the manuscript pages, yes there is some manuscript pages you can only get by playing on nightmare mode.. which means you have to play the game twice. Now i'm off to play the Alan Wake's American Nightmare game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It helped tidy up a couple of narrative threads that left me wanting more at the end of this game.  Also, it's good game in its own right.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent atmosphere with a great story, writing, and characters; there's very little about this game that doesn't work. The ""fight with light"" mechanic is brilliant, as is the hook of finding pages of the manuscript to the story that you're playing. Some of the cheap scares get old, and the product placement is a little obnoxious, but those are minor gripes overall. I've played through this numerous times when I had a 360, and this is the only (exclusive at the time) game that I missed after selling it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game that holds itself high enough through polished visual style and an interesting, albeit straightforward gameplay mechanic. Story is an OK script that baits you on, but I couldn't finish the game as the pacing bored me.I would remove the horror tag though, and replace it with 'mildly startling'.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Genre: 3rd person shooter, thriller, action, dramaMy Opinion: B+Length: ~10hoursReplay: LowIts a 3rd person suspense thiller shooter. The game's visuals are great and there are some really scenic areas in the game, along with well done models and textures for the time. The only things that were not top notch were the combat, and the driving. The combat was slightly clunky, along with the ability to basically dodge out of the way of pretty much any attack, and the driving was just insufferable, since the cars would break down far too often since they get damaged when you run into enemies.Overall, its a fun game, worth taking a look at if you are ok with 3rd person shooters, not anything super exceptional, since the story is pretty bog standard for a suspense thriller, where it feels like a typical Stephen King novel.

												Alan wake a great game, your greatest weapon is the light, the game is scary at times but it really thrives at it's characters & storyline. I really enjoyed the tv show style they gave, breaking it off and giving an ""episode"" a climatic ending, which as real tv shows to, keeps you desiring for the next. The game is very atmospheric and lighting, as it needed to be, is amazing. Brilliant game 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you play games for the game play mechanics, then you might like this title. Alan Wake is a third-person survival horror mystery. The main character is a writer, so he is portrayed as not very athletic. This translates into the feeling of slugish and unresponsive movement. Enemies must first be cleansed of darkness by shining a flashlight on them for varying amounts of time (3-10 seconds). I found this mechanic to be a bit frustrating later in the game. The flashlight also acts as the targeting reticule. There are 5 different guns available: revolver, double-barrel shotgun, pump-action shotgun, hunting rifle and the flare gun. The flare gun acts as a rocket launcher since all of the enemies are weak to light. There are also flashbangs and road flares. Ammo is somewhat scare, and there will be times when the player will be out of ammo if care isn't taken. There is no upgrade system in this game.If you play games for the storytelling, then you will probably like this title.  The main character and his wife go on vacation to a small pacific northwest town in an attempt to cure his writer's block. I found the characters to be mostly interesting. I also though that the dialog and voice acting were very good.The design of the world and the characters is very good in my opinion. The lighting is mostly dark, though. There are a few sections of the story that take place during the day, but most of it is during the night.I was annoyed by the frailty and sluggishness of the main character, and the fact that most of the game takes place at very low light levels. This obviously gave a sense of urgancy to everything, but this changed to annoyance for me towards the later parts of the story. I also foung the game to be more challenging than I would have expected on the lowest difficulty setting.Overall, I enjoyed my time with this title. Aside from the annoyances, I found the story to be well worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent atmosphere with a great story, writing, and characters; there's very little about this game that doesn't work. The ""fight with light"" mechanic is brilliant, as is the hook of finding pages of the manuscript to the story that you're playing. Some of the cheap scares get old, and the product placement is a little obnoxious, but those are minor gripes overall. I've played through this numerous times when I had a 360, and this is the only (exclusive at the time) game that I missed after selling it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A rather unique title, Alan Wake sets you in a richhorror environment which - contrary to its genre - takes the bold turn to tell you the story before it happens. The combat, surprisingly for a third person game, is not set behind chest high walls in a whack-a-mole fashion. Instead you must run about with some rather clunky dodging skills and point a torch at things -then- fill them with bullets. The nature of the enemies presented makes them well suited to the genre but since bullets are nearly always in abundance their threat isnt all that great which diminishes their effects.While still entertaining to a degree, that its story really outranks its gameplay is a sign that it had a lot of thought and care put into it, the odd presentation in that the game is divided into chapters which each have an ending sequence quickly followed by a recap makes it seem it was written for a different medium - the tendency for each chapter to have a high tension ending followed by an unneeded stripping and debriefing to put the player into the next chapter is quite jarring.That said; the unconventional pre-warning of the story to the player is well thought out and - more importantly - well used. While the player may learn what will happen, its never said how or why or (in cases) when. By loosely leading the story like this it creates anticipation as well as a foggy conclusion which works just right, adding a slight overarching mystery affair.Also, as a protagonist, Alan is a pretty big♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not Nathan Drake cuntish, but still nearing that.

No. It's also very immersive and unpredictable, and genuinely scary. Mechanics and all are very intuitive and fun, with the light and all, but not too far out there.

These moments detract/distract from the flowing tension and should have been excluded or improved upon.

												A real review.The missing tag for Alan Wake in it's discription is 'story driven'. Alan Wake is a story driven game. There are many good things about this game but it is the story that will compel you to finish it.The horror aspect is mixed into the gameplay and it works at the start as you nervously walk through a forest at night with the feeling you are being chased by axe weilding country folk. As the story progesses you will master the combat style of duelwielding a flash light and a gun to kill the 'darkness'. Once mastered you find yourself collecting heaps of ammo, flares, flashbangs etc, so much so that no matter what object the 'darkness' chooses to posses you will have more than enough to defend yourself and loosing some of that horror in the process.The gameplay is different than anything else i have played which straight away makes it fun. Visually, the world you are in is beautiful, dark, dangerous and mysterious. The sound is also very good. The game has a great atmosphere. But...The cutscenes and story are so so so much better than the level design and gameplay that you will reach a cutscene, learn more of this increasingly interesting and captivating story, you will be all excited to find out more when Alan somehow manages to fall back into a forest. A dark forest. You finally get to the next cutscene, awesome, more story but then Alan slips and falls into the forest. Cutscene, forest, cutscene, another ****ing forest. That is how i felt playing this game by the end. I was racing through the level to get to the next part in the story. The horror gameplay really takes a back seat maybe half way through the game.But the story is that good that you will want to keep playing. One last thing, there is one type of enemy that you come across , little spoiler...It is so annoying, runs super fast so you cant shine your flashlight on it until it attacks you. It runs all around so you dont know from which direction will it jump out of the darkness, sounds scary but it isn't. It takes so long to try attack you that you have to stand there for a few minutes waiting. It's frustrating. You will know this enemy as soon as you see him. If he takes too long to attck you just run to the next checkpoint and he will dissapear. Really stupid character.All in all, if you want an action game with non repetitve gameplay this game is NOT for you! If you want something different with a great story this game IS FOR YOU! I liked it accept for that one type of enemy, so stupid, shouldn't be in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Never even heard of this game until a review of my new video card (EVGA GTX980...which is amzing btw).  It was on sale in the steam store over the holidays for $3.  I have to say this is a very impressive and entertaining game and worth the regular cost even if not on sale.  I purchased it for my son and a friend while it was on sale.  Graphics amazing - Gameplay is very user friendly but makes you think a little - Creepy Intense when you really follow the story and immerse yourself in the game.  During surround gaming on triple monitors it was flawless and beautiful.  I would recommend this game for anyone looking for an unusually different type gameplay and plot.

												Imagine if Stephen King wrote a season of Twin Peaks.Alan Wake is a frustrated writer taking a break with his wife to the small, secluded town of Bright Falls. All is not as it seems as there is an undefinable evil hiding in the woods, stalking townspeople and turning them into crazed monsters known as ""taken"". When Alan's wife dissapears, he must venture into the woods to find her and piece together what happened using pages from a book he doesn't remember writing.Alan Wake is a tense, forboding horror game. The most notable feature is the ""fight with light"" mechanic, where the taken are invulnerable to regular weapons until you burn out their protective aura using your torch, flares and flashbangs, as well as stationary light sources. Combat is a close quarters affair, as your dodge mechanic lets you evade slashes by the skin of your teeth. There isn't really any boss fights but there are occasional poltergeists (inanimate objects infused with the darkness and act as missiles) as well as some great set pieces to add variety to the combat.Remedy's use of light and shadow in Alan Wake is outstanding, helping to create an incredible sense of dread. Seening a quick fog come screaming through the trees and catching glimpses of taken watching you from the distance is quite unsettling.The story is quite good, even if it does contrive reasons for Alan to be out in the woods every night. The game is divided up into six episodes (8 if you include the DLC), each with their own recap and credits making you very much feel like you're playing a t'v show, even if the lip-synching is pretty poor.All in all, Alan Wake is an excellant game. I wouldn't call it survival-horror as you're usually kept reasonably stocked up on ammo but more as psychological horror, as you are constantly asking yourself what's real and what's not. Alan Wake stays with your for a long time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's start with the overall setting: the game's very atmospheric. The world is finely crafted and believable and makes the player want to go exploring it further. It's designed like a TV show, and it pays homage to Twin Peaks and other mystery/thriller shows. I also liked the tongue-in-cheek humour in the Twilight Zone parodies and TV talk shows. The characters are memorable and even likeable (except Alan himself IMHO). The characters have a pretty decent voice acting, but horrible lip-syncing. Their mouths are just unnatural and gave me the creeps (purposefully uncanny valley or just inability/laziness?).The gameplay is smooth and involves a heavy use of light, which adds to the atmosphere nicely. The shadows are impressive. Unfortunately the gameplay repeats itself and you start noticing some patterns. For example, you mostly run through linear paths, fighting enemies every 2 minutes. And at the end of the path there's a calm area and you always drop down into a lower platform, so that you can't go back where you came from. This is an arena, where you have to hold out for a certain time or fight a miniboss. Or your path is suddenly blocked off by some falling debris or something and you have to find another way around. You always see it coming and it gets really tiring after a while. This is my main gripe with the game; it's repetitive.The game starts slow and picks up the pace around midway through. It kind of keeps you interested throughout, just enough to not make you want to uninstall it before finishing it. But if you're not a patient player, this game might not be worth your while. In the end, you're not missing much. I'm recommending this game for its atmospheric qualities only, the rest is a bit unrewarding. There are a few moments that I'll remember fondly, like the ""rock concert"" or the part where Sarah and Barry join you. The game has some frustrating moments, but it's never too difficult if you take the time to learn the mechanics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing! It's like watching a movie. It has fun novel and films' references, along with a dense history and plot twists that leave you breathless (at least, I've felt that way). I do not consider it as a Survival Horror (there were some tense moments, but it is not something that can traumatize you), but is equally rewarding. You may get attached to many of the characters. Honestly, I desperately recommend it. I feel it's worthy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game Name: Alan WakeGame Overall Score: 10/10Alan wake is an amazing horror survival game made by Remedy Entertainment. The game starts off with you being a successful writer and taking a trip with your wife to Bright falls to relax from novel writing. The game has a very unique story and interesting combat system, although it is repetitive since there are few enemy types in the game. It’s a fairly straight forward game, point your flashlight at the enemy, wait for its darkness shield to disappear and then fire away with one of your weapons (Revolver, Shotgun, Flare gun, etc.) until its destroyed. I also like how the game is not too futuristic or advanced, but more of an old-fashioned kind of a game. Nowadays most of the games that are produced and sold are way to futuristic, which makes the production of old-fashioned games rarer. The performance and quality are very realistic and makes you feel that you’re in the game. I also like how there are secret chests and supplies lying around which gives you more to explore in the game. Also the game has fairly easy keying binds and controls for the player.I would recommend this game to people that are looking for an old-fashioned, third-person, survival, and horror game. But the game in my option, lacks enemy diversity. But the mysterious story of Alan wake makes up for lack of enemy diversity.The ending of Alan Wake was shocking for me since it ended in cliff-hanger.  But I like the way they closed the story, because it has potential idea for DLCs or other games.Fun Fact: The Remedy team spent a lot of time in the pacific northwest, collecting reference photos and getting a sense of the geography and climate in the areas. The art director and the rest of the team drove about 2,000 miles around Astoria, North Bend, and outside of Seattle for almost two weeks gathering information for the creation of this game.

												This game has stunning visuals with a knack for the creepy and the misleading. Suffice it to say this game won me over after the first 5 minutes. The story keeps you guessing, the gameplay keeps you motivated and the atmosphere keeps you on edge.It's been a while since I saw a game so fleshed out with all kinds of characters and memorable moments. As I said before if you haven't played this game yet you should you'll thank me later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a game about the titular writer who finds himself sucked into a dream like world of his own making. Forced to write by a dark presense, he must fight to save his wife who has been abducted by said presence.First off, let me say the story in this game is convoluted, hard to follow, wierd, odd, senseless at times, off the wall bonkers, and ultimately pretty interesting. The writing is uneven, but mostly pretty good. This game startled me quite a few times.Your ever present flashlight is your frontline defense against the dark polluted ""Taken"", your revolver is the next. Mostly this works pretty well, but honestly, I thought the controls were a little clunky at times. It controls exactly like Max Payne 1, which isn't strange considering its the same studio that made Max Payne. The only thing is Max Payne is 13 years old at this point. Control schemes have evolved.Graphically, I actually liked it quite a bit. The lighting is cool.I am not a great writer, obviously, but maybe this review helps somebody. It took me about 15 hours to finish the main story, and I thought for the $5 I paid for it, that was a good deal. Will I play through it again...probably not any time soon, but maybe. I'd give it a 7.9.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those rare games where your imagination can be used to massively increase the gaming experience. Some here have described it as playing a Stephen King horror story and I have to agree. If you're a jaded player and go looking for faults, you'll find them in every game including this one, but the story driven gameplay is fantastic. Well that's my opinion.It is one of the most atmospheric games I've played and ranks in my small personal list of great games.Play alone, in the dark and with headphones. Engage your imagination and child-like fear of the dark, then feel your skin crawl as you play. Never did a lamp-post look so appealing. Enjoy.Note: For me, get the original and stick with it because the extra bonus levels and American nightmare just don't cut it at all. They don't have the same well written atmosphere to them and do nothing for the terrific ending of the first game.During the game listen to Alan Wakes' description of what makes a horror story feel real etc etc. If you get what he's saying then just stop at the end of the first game. When you think about it, it's a truly horrifying ending ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely loved this game, if there's one series that's brought me back to the silent hill era it's Alan wake (Yes series because of the expansions)..  Intense thriller story line that grips you from start to finish.  Stunning visuals and an interesting gameplay mechanic thrown in (The flashlight).  You'll never want to stop playing.So far I've beat it twice and it still never gets old.  There aren't many games that compell me to beat them once let alone another time.The downside to all this is that it's pretty linear.  I'm not speaking from my point of view on this one because I don't mind but some might find the on rails action a bit stale.  9/10 on graphics10/10 gameplay6/10 on replayability (Only because it's a total mind bender and I don't find games like these offer much in another playthrough...  Even though I beat it twice many may not want to brave the game for a second playthrough)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fresh take on the Survival Horror Genre. A psychological manipulator that has wit, innovation and integrity.Play as writer Alan Wake when he awakens in a world full of mystery and full of darkness. Travel through wicked territories and face terrifying creatures in order to rescue your girlfriend from the demonic forces.Light is your only friend and is the only thing that can help you on your journey. In order to cause damage to any demon you must first purge them with light to break down their protective barrier. Use a flashlight, street lamp, torch, explosive barrel - any resource available to illuminate the darkness and defeat the demons.10/10 - Highly recommended to fans of the Survival Horror Genre.

												A real review.The missing tag for Alan Wake in it's discription is 'story driven'. Alan Wake is a story driven game. There are many good things about this game but it is the story that will compel you to finish it.The horror aspect is mixed into the gameplay and it works at the start as you nervously walk through a forest at night with the feeling you are being chased by axe weilding country folk. As the story progesses you will master the combat style of duelwielding a flash light and a gun to kill the 'darkness'. Once mastered you find yourself collecting heaps of ammo, flares, flashbangs etc, so much so that no matter what object the 'darkness' chooses to posses you will have more than enough to defend yourself and loosing some of that horror in the process.The gameplay is different than anything else i have played which straight away makes it fun. Visually, the world you are in is beautiful, dark, dangerous and mysterious. The sound is also very good. The game has a great atmosphere. But...The cutscenes and story are so so so much better than the level design and gameplay that you will reach a cutscene, learn more of this increasingly interesting and captivating story, you will be all excited to find out more when Alan somehow manages to fall back into a forest. A dark forest. You finally get to the next cutscene, awesome, more story but then Alan slips and falls into the forest. Cutscene, forest, cutscene, another ****ing forest. That is how i felt playing this game by the end. I was racing through the level to get to the next part in the story. The horror gameplay really takes a back seat maybe half way through the game.But the story is that good that you will want to keep playing. One last thing, there is one type of enemy that you come across , little spoiler...It is so annoying, runs super fast so you cant shine your flashlight on it until it attacks you. It runs all around so you dont know from which direction will it jump out of the darkness, sounds scary but it isn't. It takes so long to try attack you that you have to stand there for a few minutes waiting. It's frustrating. You will know this enemy as soon as you see him. If he takes too long to attck you just run to the next checkpoint and he will dissapear. Really stupid character.All in all, if you want an action game with non repetitve gameplay this game is NOT for you! If you want something different with a great story this game IS FOR YOU! I liked it accept for that one type of enemy, so stupid, shouldn't be in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. It is a shame I have to put up these notes telling people what they should already know on to do their own, but due to inflammatory commentry, I do.A game much different than anything I ever played. The best way to describe the game is a survival horror done int he way of an interactive short tv series with an overlying narrative like that of a visualized book. The gameplay is magnificent and controls are at times a bit extensive but easy to get used to. It's very environmentally interactive and nearly as realistic and logical as a game can get. This game is fun in terms of reading a good mystery novel, only you're in control and replace the need to read text, there are stunning visuals, haunting melodies, and the goal to help you, Alan wake, discover what is reality and what is fiction, if reality still even exists. Writers truly get lost in their work...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have to say this is a very impressive and entertaining game and worth the regular cost even if not on sale.  I purchased it for my son and a friend while it was on sale.  Graphics amazing - Gameplay is very user friendly but makes you think a little - Creepy Intense when you really follow the story and immerse yourself in the game.  During surround gaming on triple monitors it was flawless and beautiful.  I would recommend this game for anyone looking for an unusually different type gameplay and plot.

												Alan Wake is a survival horror/action game hybrid revolving around a writer, Alan Wake, and his fight to reclaim is wife from an unknown force called ""the Dark Presence.The light is the core element of the title's gameplay: the light of your flashlight makes the enemies vulnerable to your more earthly attacks; cone of lights called ""Safe Heavens"" act as checkpoints and health dispensers; the light is the only thing capable of thwarting the Presence's progress.The survival horror elements of Alan Wake come into play in the enemies often overcrowding you and your need to save ammo and other useful items: to the point that you are better off just running away from pursuers to the next Save Heaven most of the time.Said gameplay,an overall very good, thrilling, atmospheric story and some severe cases of scenary porn make Alan Wake a charming title in its own right			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake, now on PC, and much better than on console. If you like horror based games, you are going to like Alan Wake. You play out a horror novel written by you, that you don't remember writing,  in an attempt to save your wife from an acient evil. The tevevision mini-series delivery of the game makes it all the more enjoyable. If you like this genre, you do not want to miss out on Alan Wake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a fantastic horror game with great narrative, story and voice acting. The characters are endearing, funny and believable, the world is rich and portrayed in a realistic way and even for a 2012 game, the graphics still holds up and looks pretty. The gunplay is satisfying and has that ""ummfff"" factor to it. If you're looking for a horror game that is unique and has good storytelling, this is definitely the game for you. Just remember one thing. Don't go in the dark. Stay in the light.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I rarely replay games, but this one deserved it. Had it outside of Steam and just had to buy it here and replay it (and will probably replay it for the 3rd time in the close future).Alan Wake feels and plays like a well written action horror book/TV show. It's not too scary, but sometimes it simply nails that awesome eerie atmosphere. I really hope that we'll see Alan Wake 2 in the future.""It's not a lake. It's an ocean.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a good example of something that truely tested time and aged well. I played this game back when it first came out on the Xbox 360, and playing it again on PC not only brought back good memories, but also showed me that this game to this day is still fantastic. Graphically for the most part it is beautiful especially when it comes to the game's lighting, but there were some low res texture, some of the screens from TVs are a bit hard to see, foliage popped in at ridiculously low ranges when driving in some areas, and in one section there were some funky shadow problems even though I had the graphics settings set to as high as they will go. Technically, the game does run fine for the most part. I did encounter some slow down and very minor stutters, but only when it was very busy on screen with flare and flashbang effects, but other than outside of that it ran fine. The story will keep you on edge of what is happening with the mystery of the setting of the game, Bright Falls, and the curse that is on it and what is all happening with the character waking up from a car crash a week later after he tries to save his wife and not knowing what is going on. Gameplay is very innovative where you have to use lights to defeat your enemies. Flashlights and lanterns only get rid of the darkness that shields enemies so that you can kill them with guns, flares ward enemies off while getting rid of the darkness on them in a wider area, and flare guns, flashbangs, and giant lights will outright defeat enemies. There are a few variety of enemies, although not many. I really only count about 6 different enemies, normal enemies, tougher enemies, much tougher enemies, fast enemies, crows, and poltergeists, and while they do vary a bit like the tougher enemies can shrug off you using the light boost and fast enemies easily dart around an area and much harder to concentrate your flashlight on, they all pretty much require the same way to defeat them; get rid of the darkness in them with your flashlight or any sort of light source and then shoot them, unless you defeated them with a flaregun or flashbang or it is a crow or poltergeist to which they'll just immediately die after the darkness is gone from them. I honestly think that is this game's biggest fault, the combat, because it will get very repetitive very fast especially since each level lasts quite a while. The game does present itself as pretty challenging at times, while being as fair as possible. I do think that the way that some enemies can easily gang up and almost immediately drain your health bar without any kind of recovery was a bit cheap, but you are given resources to help keep this from happening. Speaking of difficulty, and this is just a small note on something for anyone who wants to play the game, I have not done any kind of searching about this nor do I remember if this was part of the original Xbox 360 release, but it does seem that the difficulties are a bit misleading in the game. The game has 3 total difficulties, Easy, Normal, and Nightmare. Now I played the game through Normal, but when I beat the game it says that I completed it on both Normal and Hard even though a Hard difficulty option is not showing up at all. I have a feeling that there is no Easy difficulty and Easy is actually Normal difficulty, Normal is Hard, and Nightmare is Nightmare. As mentioned earlier, levels do last quite a while, and even though the game is mostly linear, there is a great deal of exploration that can be done in each level, and you are rewarded for exploring the levels to find each of the game's hidden secrets rather it be hidden chests which you can find by shining your flast light on certain areas that will reveal yellow paint that show you where to go, manuscript pages which tie into the game's story, TVs that will broadcast a TV show called Night Springs which is sorta like The Twilight Zone or will show Alan thinking about the situation he is in, Radios that will give a bit of behind the scenes of what is happening at the time of the level, or give a bit of history to the game's town. The game also encourages a 2nd playthrough where some manuscript pages can only be found on Nightmare difficulty. There is however 2 other collectibles that are in the game for seemingly no reason other than achievement purposes, the coffee thermoses and can pyramids, which to my knowledge don't seem to unlock or do anything, they're just there. There is a good amount in the game that will be worth the purchase. There is a total of 6 levels in the game that make up the core main game, and it'll take about 8-10 hours if you decide to go off the beaten path a bit to find some of the secrets in the game, maybe around 6 hours if you decide to rush through and skip over the secret stuff. There is also 2 bonus levels which will give you around 2-4 extra hours. My main complaints about the game is that it seemed to drag on with how fast the gameplay becomes repetitive and the levels while explorable to extent, go on for a while. I can easily recommend this game if you're looking for a horror game that has a great story and will give you plenty to do. The gameplay will get old fast, but if you do not mind it, then this game is easy enough for me to say that I recommend a buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably one of the most mindf**** games, from the beggining to the half of the game you will be like; ""The hell is going on?!"", but It has a really good story by far! The gameplay is there, the controls are sometime broken, and the invisible monsters gives you a weird blur on the screen, wich I don't know if there should be. At the graphics level, it is really good for a 2012 game, and sometimes you will get some really nice screenshots with some beautiful places through the mountains and lakes.My ratings:-Story 9/10-Gameplay 7/10-PC Optimisation 10/10-Level Design 8/10-Atmosphere 8/10-Graphics 8/10The lenght of the game is 8-10 hours (All Cutscenes + Exploring the game).

												One of my favorite games of all time. It's like a Stephen King book come to life. It manages to be very scary by preying on your fear of the dark without resorting to cheap jumpscares. I definitely recommend you play it.The story is filled with suspense and mystery, it's super engaging. It's heavily inspired by Twin Peaks, so fans of the show take the time to spot some easter eggs and find some thermoses filled with some damn good coffee. The soundtrack is awesome too. The ""light"" combat system this game utilizes is pretty neat, and although people say it can get repetitive, I think it's fun enough that it doesn't detract from the game. This is also one of the few games where playing on a harder difficulty can make the game harder without making it needlessly frustrating.I will list a few cons, however. This version is a console port, and this really really shows on older end machines. Luckily, most PCs today should be able to play it no problem. I can run it on highest settings at 60FPS on my GTX670 no problem, but the game doesn't visually seem like it would require as advanced a GPU as it actually does. The aiming and walking may also seem a bit wonky, but that's also a consequence of it being a console port.Overall rating: 9.5/10. I absolutely love everything about this game, but I gotta take half a point off for the issues stemming from it being a console port.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A beautiful game with a thrilling and original story, featuring unique gameplay that defines this game as an amazing atmospheric third-person shooter. Come for the gameplay, stay for the beautiful story that will leave you wanting more.The visuals themself are stunning. I played through this game on low quality and it was one of the most visually awe-inspiring sceneries I'd ever seen.The gameplay is unique and flows along greatly. The unique gameplay makes for some new shooting experiences, whether you're shooting with a flashlight or a revolver in hand.The story is perhaps the best part of the game. It's emotional, with excellent twists and turns and a unique plot unlike the 'This is invaded by darkness, save it.' plot. The genre is always changing, from getting into action into a horror story (or at least a creepy game). Ever-changing.The soundtrack is beautiful as well, listening to it through the Collector's Edition revealed that to me.Well, what are you waiting for? Buy this masterpiece!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is ambitious if nothing else. It took the makers years to make (which included many delays), and there is clear evidence throughout the game that it was originally meant to be at least semi-open world rather than sectioned into levels. Once it did come out though, it heralded a new style of narrative with chapters played like episodes of a TV show, replete with visual summaries of the previous episode at the start of each of them. That desire to experiment with narrative in the game is easily the best part, and even though it's very heavily inspired by Stephen King, it's still a very original style for gaming and will keep you playing through even the dullest gameplay portions. And that's the main problem with Alan Wake, the gameplay. Now, that's not to say it's even that bad, it's actually pretty enjoyable and adds a lot of tension that really helps the game's atmosphere. The game even introduces new and interesting enemies for a while that keep you on your toes! But somewhere around the halfway point the game gets bored with introducing new gameplay elements, and of course shortly after that point you will too. The game really does start to drag towards the end, and if you're anything like me it will feel like a real grind to finish it and see what happens to the story. Aaaand then there's no satisfactory conclusion either. The game wants you to play the episodes that were released as DLC, but due to lukewarm reception (the game already got boring, and the DLC adds nothing while rewarding you with even less substantial story), they got cut short at just the 2. I should mention Alan Wake 2 is rumoured to be in the works, so there is that anyway.But to cut this short, Alan Wake is absolutely fantastic for half of the game, and then falls short towards the end. Despite this, it's frankly a must play for what it does right, so I recommend it for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Score: 7/10This game will give you the feeling of playing a book/movie with a very thrilling experience, as it have a good and very mysterious plot that have been well spaced. The game seems to be developed to be played almost like a TV series, being divided in 6 different episodes (+2 if you buy the DLC's), each should take about 1h to 2h to be played without a rush.The light/darkness mechanic is the core point of this game and very interesting to play with, unfortunately I expected more variety and creative use of its possibilities, but the game fall short of that, giving you a dozen of weapons and creatures to play around instead.Don't get me wrong, I still think it is a good game with a unique way of getting you through it, but what you get after playing for 30min is pretty much all you will get till the end of it.

												You start off as Alan who makes his way to Bright Falls with his wife Alice after he is in need of a vacation. Upon arrival to the cavern where you are staying, the lights go out and you need to turn the power back on. You hear Alice scream and you later rush back to the cabin to find she has disappeared. From then on you are trying to put together what has happened to Alice whilst progressing through the levels taking on chainsaw wielding, axe throwing, crazy ♥♥♥ maniacs. Only these maniacs aren't human. Bullets only hurt them if you remove the shadowy appiration from them using a flashlight, flash grenades or flares. Only then will your bullets do any damage.The Good;-Nice GraphicsAmazing StoryReplayabilityGreat AtmosphereThe Bad;-Camera AnglesRepetitive CombatJust finished the game for a second time (first on the 360 way back when it came out) and it's still a great game.

It took the makers years to make (which included many delays), and there is clear evidence throughout the game that it was originally meant to be at least semi-open world rather than sectioned into levels. Once it did come out though, it heralded a new style of narrative with chapters played like episodes of a TV show, replete with visual summaries of the previous episode at the start of each of them. That desire to experiment with narrative in the game is easily the best part, and even though it's very heavily inspired by Stephen King, it's still a very original style for gaming and will keep you playing through even the dullest gameplay portions. And that's the main problem with Alan Wake, the gameplay. Now, that's not to say it's even that bad, it's actually pretty enjoyable and adds a lot of tension that really helps the game's atmosphere. The game even introduces new and interesting enemies for a while that keep you on your toes! But somewhere around the halfway point the game gets bored with introducing new gameplay elements, and of course shortly after that point you will too. The game really does start to drag towards the end, and if you're anything like me it will feel like a real grind to finish it and see what happens to the story. Aaaand then there's no satisfactory conclusion either. The game wants you to play the episodes that were released as DLC, but due to lukewarm reception (the game already got boring, and the DLC adds nothing while rewarding you with even less substantial story), they got cut short at just the 2. I should mention Alan Wake 2 is rumoured to be in the works, so there is that anyway.But to cut this short, Alan Wake is absolutely fantastic for half of the game, and then falls short towards the end. Despite this, it's frankly a must play for what it does right, so I recommend it for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Been waiting for this game to come on sale for quite a while, finally purchased it a few days ago.And it was worth the wait. This game is a superb horror survival game, with a pretty cool story. It can be intense at some times but that is a good thing.The setting of this game, is one of the most awesome ones I've experienced. Its so dark and eerie. Fog lingering about the area. What is there not to love?This game is a certain recommendation if you like third person horror survival shooters. To have a full judging of the game, you should buy it yourself.You shall not regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Purchased at $7.50Great looking game all around, excellent soundtrack of original and licensed music, and production values. Extremely fluid animations but the gameplay always felt a little too soft and laggy for me. American Nightmare fixed this. The story completely bored me start to finish, but some key set pieces, environments, and Barry's commentary kept me playing. Once its over, there's little reason to return. This was no Max Payne, I'm afraid. Worth what I paid, but just barely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I went in not really expecting much, but this game was really great. It has an amazing, immersive atmosphere and story that really gets you into the game. The combat is pretty standard third-person shooter, but ammo can be very scarce and you'll have to think about how you go about things. The graphics are really nice too, especially the lighting effects.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Long time horror-games fan here, action-horror especially. Have lots of games to compare Alan Wake to. And I have to say the game is just mediocre. Was OK in the beginning, but because negatives piled up with the time and it dragged on for way too long (partially because of ""brilliant"" idea of developers to hide story details behind collectibles, I care about stories in my games, I couldn't ignore them) I started to dislike it by the endWhat was bad:-in-game ads! Crime in any game, doubly so in horror game, which lives and dies by it's atmosphere. ""On a way to finally end it all, destroy the darkness, save your wife? don't forget, this is really, really important! VERIZON!!!""-Shooting. It is tied to the story, yes, but as feature in a game, imho, it doesn't work that well. Your flashlight is like a laser sight in other games, except worse. You have to keep pointing it to the enemy, waiting till the game decides it wasted enough of your time and let's you deal damage.-Only 4 weapons - gun, shotgun (2 variants), hunting rifle and flaregun + flares and flashbang grenades, that's it-Few enemy types. Smaller dudes, bigger dudes, teleporting dudes, crows and poltergeist. Combined with limited weapons variety encounters get stale really fast and don't change in any way from beginning to the end-random encounters, like in some cheap old JRPG. About 5 (!) seconds after dealing with one group, another appears. Again and again. Combined with previous two points.. you get the picture. This got much better in second half of the game though-camera, in close areas, especially inside buildings, it really doesn't know what to do, cost me several retries-unlikable main character. Spoiled whiny diva, gets angry when he has problems with writing then gets angry at Alice for trying to help him. Also, pointing a gun at a sheriff, who just saved him, as answer for offered help? What an asshat!-story wasn't really engaging, ""save the princess"" with lots of talking, but nothing to make me care. And when everyone is a character in a book written by Wake, why worry if something happens to them? They aren't real anyway-Darkness as main antagonist. Just darkness, with some old woman's face, doing it's evil Darknessy things. No amount of cheap jumpscares makes it actually scary or interesting or anything but boring.-no sense of progression. Comparing with amazing Resident Evil 4 - you could chose the weapon you liked, chose what you wish to upgrade, make it yours (dat Red 9!). Here it's the same weapons all the time, with the game taking them away constantly, just because (for you to find them later casually laying around)+it looks good, night forest with trees swinging and shadows of the clouds running through. Pretty creepy+Night Springs stories were cool, until once the game tricked me showing ads instead - bye immersion!... I think that's it. Other things could be good, but left me disappointed or I got sick of them (combat) so they went to negatives.What could make it better? If Wake writes it, and it's a fiction, what stopped him to give himself some supernatural abilities maybe? He could add new ones with time, get better with old ones the more he used them. This could add new ways of dealing with enemies, and add new types of enemies with abilities to match. Why it only has to be possessed people, birds and stuff lying around, reanimated as poltergeist. Is it all ""the almighty Darkness"" can do?No random encounters, hell no. Enemies appear from nowhere and disappear into nothing when defeated, only to come back 5 seconds later, leaving you with a sense that they are there only to waste your time and ammunition.Also, don't start with combat 10 minutes in and then push it almost non-stop till the end - the town is beautiful (with Twin Peaks vibes), spend some time with it. game! Make Alan interact with townsfolk more, build an atmosphere. And then, gradually, with only hints and suspicions at first, go into horror mode.could add more but it's already a wall of text, nobody will read it all anyway, lolOverall, I understand why this game could be enjoyable to other people. Depends on how much the stuff I mentioned will bother you. I just couldn't ignore it all in the end. Could have been really good game, but Remedy wasted this opportunity			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put, Alan Wake plays like a Stephen King novel turned into a TV miniseries turned into a videogame. This is intentional by Remedy and this narrative complexity is one of the game’s strengths. Remedy has woven a very complex story into Alan Wake and that’s really half of the reason to play this game. The main story, told in episodes like a TV series, is about Alan piecing together what’s happened in his missing week while the ever-present darkness corrupts the townspeople and relentlessly pursues him. However during that missing week, Alan apparently wrote a pre-cognitive novel about the very events that are happening to him, because as you play you keep finding manuscript pages that he wrote and that describe everything that subsequently happens to him. These are a lot of fun to hunt out and collect because they explain the rather fragmented story and make you feel just as desperate and paranoid as Alan—groping in the dark for answers, desperate that the next chapter page will reveal the truth he needs.Blood and gore are so downplayed in Alan Wake as to be next to nonexistent. There are no chainsaw wielding psychopaths or bloodthirsty monsters—just the creeping darkness, and the unsettling things it does to the citizens of Bright Falls. People go missing in the woods and nobody sees this as unusual; later, when you’re lost in the woods, these missing people come after you, shrouded in oily shadows and out to gut you with whatever bladed implement they have handy.Alan is a writer, not a warrior, but he has his trusty flashlight and an assortment of small arms to beat back the Taken, as the infected townspeople are called. First you must aim Alan’s light at an enemy and boost its output to burn away the darkness, and then finish off the Taken with a few shots from your pistol or shotgun. It might sound repetitive but with multiple Taken emerging from the shadows and your flashlight dwindling, it can get pretty hectic as you juggle reloading your tiny snub-nose and popping fresh batteries into your light, all while running away from and dodging attacks. Later on you can get better lights and weapons, including flares to give you breathing room and flash bang grenades to clear an area, but ammo is usually scarce and you must balance exploration with your limited reserves.Everything in the PC version is essentially the same as the Xbox 360 version. Alan Wake is one of the best converted, least buggy PC ports I have played in a long time. The quirky characters and stark daylight sequences might temporarily pull you out of the terror, but the memories of wandering around in the woods, hounded by eldritch shadows, will haunt your nightmares for months to come.DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake - AKA Alan Walk - is a game about this writer who fights against these creatures of darkness with a flashlight. This is a pretty epic since Alan can only run for 5 seconds before running out of stamina and the flashlight has battery life of 2 seconds. What makes this even more epic is the episodic nature in which you lose all your gear when advancing to new episode. You are in the limbo of awkward combat, bad fit and episodic nerf. ♥♥♥♥ yo♥♥♥♥♥♥big time. I can appreciate that. The art directing is pretty neato. Audiovisual execution can cause some chills -which is a good example of how decent the atmosphere of this game is. The horror ain't legit, nothing scary here nor are there cheap jumpscares either. The graphics were a huge surprise for me. I'd say around 17 times better than expected. Landscape simulator in a way. The ending songs also deserve a place in playlist. Good stuff there. I.e. The execution and atmosphere make up for the bad combat and lack of continuity this game suffers big time. Worth the sale price of 6 bucks or so. Don't reommend playing the console version because graphics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a good test of how important you find gameplay in video games. Essentially, Alan Wake is a cool episodicallly presented story about a man doing everything he can to find his spouse. It's strong narratively, and the presenation of rural northwestern America is pretty spot on. Voice acting is good, and by the end of the story you'll be wanting to jump on the DLC for the next chapter just to see where it goes.Unfortunately, Alan Wake has serious issues in terms of gameplay. Don't get me wrong; it works , it's just that you essentially do the same sort of survival gameplay (stop the darkness by blinding it with light) through the whole game. The game's combat sequences are almost all the same, with nearly identical enemies defeated in identical ways. It's a solidly long game too; my game time as of this review (~15 hours) is the equivalent of one playthrough.In other words, Alan Wake is extremely repetitive. This is why it's a good test of how much you really care for a game's narrative. If you love strong stories in video games and are fine with repetitive gameplay, this will be a blast. If you came here looking for invigorating gameplay, it isn't happening.In short, I can't recommend this game if you can't handle repetitive gameplay. If you can, then buy this game. It's a great story everyone deserves to see.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I stay away from most horror games, but this one is amazing. The game has an amazing atmosphere that makes you feel like you have something behind you waiting to kill you, it is extremely intense. The whole game is intense with some lighter areas ( people getting drunk, incidental stage explosions) the ending isn't satisfying but the rest of the story is great. The game Is structured as an tv show with recaps at the beginning of the episodes, it even says ""last time on alan wake"". This game isn't for the lighthearted but if you can handle it l, the game is worth it and the sound track is amazing. I would recommend the collectors edition to anyone who loves horror games or games with beautiful landscapes and an amazing story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Upon arrival to the cavern where you are staying, the lights go out and you need to turn the power back on. You hear Alice scream and you later rush back to the cabin to find she has disappeared. From then on you are trying to put together what has happened to Alice whilst progressing through the levels taking on chainsaw wielding, axe throwing, crazy ♥♥♥ maniacs. Only these maniacs aren't human. Bullets only hurt them if you remove the shadowy appiration from them using a flashlight, flash grenades or flares.

												After having played Alan Wake on xbox360 and now on PC I can definitely recommend this game. It does a really good job at immersing the player into the dark and beautifully designed world, this is one of the most detailed and well crafted game worlds I've seen. The atmosphere, story and pacing is really well done and is probably where the game shines the most. Don't expect a horror game, this is an adventure/thriller that takes the player on a nail-biting adventure that won't be forgotten easily.The gameplay and mechanics are fun and fluid with some room for improvement for buggy running and jumping controls. Other than that, the gameplay is quite unique and fun making for some intense, interesting and horrifying moments. I've played this with both keyboard/mouse and controller. The game plays easier with keyboard/mouse since it makes aiming and camera controls easier to do. A controller is definitely not required but it does come down to preference. Definitely a game that must be played if you like Thriller/Adventure story based games with unique 3rd person gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Score: 7/10This game will give you the feeling of playing a book/movie with a very thrilling experience, as it have a good and very mysterious plot that have been well spaced. The game seems to be developed to be played almost like a TV series, being divided in 6 different episodes (+2 if you buy the DLC's), each should take about 1h to 2h to be played without a rush.The light/darkness mechanic is the core point of this game and very interesting to play with, unfortunately I expected more variety and creative use of its possibilities, but the game fall short of that, giving you a dozen of weapons and creatures to play around instead.Don't get me wrong, I still think it is a good game with a unique way of getting you through it, but what you get after playing for 30min is pretty much all you will get till the end of it.

												Alan Wake is a psycological thriller made by the geniuses at Remedy Entertainment. The story is about Alan Wake, a writer who is having a hard time writing. He and his wife, Alice, goes to Bright Falls for a get away when thigns goes terribly wrong. Whitout giving spoilers, Alan has to save Alice. The story is really well told and kept me on the edge of my seat.The gameplay is interesting too. The game is a third person shooter where light is very important, The light undler lamp posts are safe spots and without the players flashlight, the enemies would have been invinsible. That is because the enemies are covered with darkness. the player has to burn the darkness away with a flashlight before being able to kill the enemies. The graphics are great and uses light and darkness in the enironment to great effect. The directos cut has all the DLC included and rounds off the story of Alan very nicely. Altought the stroy still isn`t completely told. The level design in the DLC is some of the most creative level design I have seen in a long time. P.S. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtrack in a game. It is something I listen to on a regular basis.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In the war between darkness and light, you are a desperate writer frantically trying to save his wife from the forces of evil. A unique and brilliant third person shooter with awesome mechanics but repetitive gameplay. In my personal opinion, it's an 8 out of 10. Definitely recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a psycological thriller made by the geniuses at Remedy Entertainment. The story is about Alan Wake, a writer who is having a hard time writing. He and his wife, Alice, goes to Bright Falls for a get away when thigns goes terribly wrong. Whitout giving spoilers, Alan has to save Alice. The story is really well told and kept me on the edge of my seat.The gameplay is interesting too. The game is a third person shooter where light is very important, The light undler lamp posts are safe spots and without the players flashlight, the enemies would have been invinsible. That is because the enemies are covered with darkness. the player has to burn the darkness away with a flashlight before being able to kill the enemies. The graphics are great and uses light and darkness in the enironment to great effect. The directos cut has all the DLC included and rounds off the story of Alan very nicely. Altought the stroy still isn`t completely told. The level design in the DLC is some of the most creative level design I have seen in a long time. P.S. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtrack in a game. It is something I listen to on a regular basis.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a Portable Electricity Generator simulator released by Remedy in 2012.During gameplay you will be required to start, repair, and get killed next to various generators scattered throughout the playable world.Various enemies will hinder your progress to start each generator, and you can hold them off by using flares, your flashlight, or your flashlight and gun.Once the generator has started it will usually power a lightbulb, which will heal your health and dispell enemies long enough to make your way to the next generator.90 Volts / 115 Volts			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A severely underrated gem trampled under the weight of the triple A game market, and essentially abandoned for a lack of the ""broader appeal"" that is the triple A game industry's white whale.  Alan Wake is a fun and athmospheric surreal horor game that is also an incredible meditation on storytelling itself.  It had a sort-of sequel in Alan Wake's American Nightmare to tie up some loose ends in the plot.Unfortunately, the game was a victim of Ending DLC.  The actual ending to the game is divided, yes split down the middle, between two seperate DLCs named The Signal and The Writer.  There's really no excuse for that.Fortunately you can now get everything, American Nightmare and ending DLC, all at once for around $40 all togeather.  And I heavily recommend you do so.  Alan Wake could have been a spectacular series, it's just too bad Remedy succumbed to the Triple-A games fever rather than following FROM Software's incredibly sucessful example with the Souls games.

The atmosphere is quite spooky but not so intense like FPS horror game like outcast or Amnesia, a little bit of the previous RE game.Not so many action in here, more like narrative story continuing and kill the enemies.It's good if you like narrative game stories, action adventure, a little bit exploring, and don't forget the spooky and erie feelings.Overall 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a spoilerfree review of an entire playthrough of the german version of the game and its bonus missions on medium difficulty, playing with mouse and keyboard.Since I said spoilerfree I'm only give some vague hints if anything when talking about the story. With which I shall also start. The story tries to be a horror story, if it was a book though it would be a really crappy book. If you start thinking about it even a little bit it becomes a swiss cheese of plotholes. Ironically in the game it is being said, that a good horror story has to be very logical and yet the parts of the game are so unlogical. Since its a game and not a book though the story gets you through the game pretty well. The story also would give room for a huge variety of enemies, but this variety isn't there. The enemies are: guy with a hammer, guy with a chainsaw, guy with an axe, guy with a knife, guy throwing knifes, guy with a pipewrench... you get the idea. Except for the guys throwing knifes they all engage in melee kombat. The kombat itself is either bad or good depeding on how lucky you are. Its one out of two scenarios: 1: Shine your light on the enemys and fire when their shield is gone. Reload while shining the light, give a headshot, turn 180 degrees kill the sneaky guy who wanted to kill you from behind, dodge the hammer of a big guy trying to crush you, get some air firing a signal pistol at him and watch him go BOOM kill the last 2 guys and walk on. OR 2: Try to dodge an attack, fail, get hit, tumble forward, get hit again, get circled, die. The controls ( I repeat, with mouse and keyboard) could really be better. Dodging is a matter of luck sometimes and since you shine your light on your enemies sometimes you have a hard time seeing where you shoot, especially since there is no crosshair and you basically shoot where you shine your lamp, but especially on long distance your lamp shines on a pretty wide area. Its not unplayable though, I only rarely died because of controls-in combat that is. There is also small sections of the game where you balance on fallen down trees or jump over small holes or whatever. You will die in at least one of those sections. The things that kills you most often in combat is actually the camera angle. It third person , but you still cant see if someone is behind you until it is to late. You also cant really hear people coming from behind you. At least my experience with the entire game was that it was insanely quiet. I actually had to put my headphones on instead of having them run at maximum volume, which is something I never had to do before in any other game. The talking is quiet even if you turn up the volume, well more quiert than the music and sound effects at least, so that I often didn't understand a word. That is not a problem though because the voice acting (again: I played the german version) is pretty bad. I find it amazing how uninterested you can be about being surrounded by guys with weapons not knowing if you will survive. Nah, Wake doesn't care. He comments on it like he would tell the weather to someone when he is extremely tired and bored.  Some of the other characters do a better job though. What I like about the game is that, even though its not an open world and you just go forward from place to place, it actually feels real. The mountains, mines, forests, villages all look convincing. And the line you walk forward on isnt as narrow as it could be. There is many a house or cave on the side where you can either get ammo or collectibles. Some of the collectibles are actually so hard to find that I would say that with a bit of effort you will find around 80 percent and without effort 60 percent, but finding all of it? Good luck with that. There is actually signs telling you more about the history of the place the game plays in and radio transmissions that tell you whats going on at the moment. Its not anything particularly interesting, but it makes the world feel more real and is of course nice for those who care a bit more about a fictional world that they are only gonna spend a couple of hours in anyway. Well a couple of hours is a bit underexxagerated, since I am not going to play the game again, as it has no replay value, just look at the time I played it and take away around 2 hours in which I just left it running while eating or something and you have the amound of time you spend on this when you dont rush, die a couple of times and actually try to get as many not so hard to find collectibles and ammo crates as possible and play the bonus missions. Speaking of which, I almost missed them. I finished the game and was like ""hm since I cant press continue anymore lets see what these other buttons do before I shut off the game forever"" so I pressed on ""episodes"" and there was the ones I had and two epidoes, that each said ""special episode"" and I was like ""dafuq? lets give it a try"" and man those missions were pretty long and pretty decent, so why hide them like this? Anyway: to the atnosphere. It never really scared me once. The things supposed to scare you are pretty cheap once you have already seen them. O there is a haystack at the end of these stairs? I wonder what is gonna happen. Focus your lamp on the wannabe jumpscare, fire the shotgun and move on after reloading. O there is a bridge that looks like its about to collapse? Dont worry, even if you spend 3 hours on it everythings ok, but as soon as you reach the end BOOM everythings gonna crash behind you. Man that was close I guess? I can't say the game didn't make me feel uneasy though, but that's about it. I also don't think the nightmare difficulty would give me the feeling of ""OMG I am going to die, I better run"", rather ""ugh, yet another death, screw it this time i'll just run and skip all of this."" As a fazit I can reccomend it though, not for the insane 28 euros it costs at full price, but I would already pick it up at 10. Its not a bad game, its actually a decent experience that will keep you occupied for more than just 4 hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Console port or not, Alan Wake is by far one of the best games, period, I've played in quite some time.  The story centers around Alan Wake (didn't see that coming, did you? :P) a writer who gets caught up in supernatural events.  The story isn't the most original in the world, but it gives credit where credit is due.  Homages to Stephen King and Twin Peaks, among others, give Alan Wake a surrealistic charm.  The 'Light vs the Dark' mechanic works extremely well.  Flashlight batteries and ammo are most definitely resources to be used judiciously (run out and you'll be sweating bullets).  Personally, I loved this game mechanic.  Nowhere in Alan Wake do you ever find random ammo and battery dumps just so you can stock up.  When you do find them, you'll probably faint in relief.  IMO, the game ALWAYS gives you just enough resources to survive the various encounters.  No more, no less.  How you survice, IF you survive, will require a little thinking on your part. Additionally, every 'encounter' and discovery serves to drive the story forward; 'filler material' is almost non-existant.  Very few games out there can make that claim.  Be patient as the game is like any well written thriller (film or literature).  There are 'red herrings' and detours but they too serve the overall story.  The ending will certainly leave some peope confused but never fear!  Simply go the Main Menu, options, episodes, and voila!  The two DLC that come with the game, 'The Signal' and 'The Writer' will be there for you to continue the story.  <'The Signal' is the episode you'll want to start with>  I bought Alan Wake during a Steam sale at 75% off though I would have gladly paid full price for it.  It is that good. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Score: 7/10This game will give you the feeling of playing a book/movie with a very thrilling experience, as it have a good and very mysterious plot that have been well spaced. The game seems to be developed to be played almost like a TV series, being divided in 6 different episodes (+2 if you buy the DLC's), each should take about 1h to 2h to be played without a rush.The light/darkness mechanic is the core point of this game and very interesting to play with, unfortunately I expected more variety and creative use of its possibilities, but the game fall short of that, giving you a dozen of weapons and creatures to play around instead.Don't get me wrong, I still think it is a good game with a unique way of getting you through it, but what you get after playing for 30min is pretty much all you will get till the end of it.

												Long time horror-games fan here, action-horror especially. Have lots of games to compare Alan Wake to. And I have to say the game is just mediocre. Was OK in the beginning, but because negatives piled up with the time and it dragged on for way too long (partially because of ""brilliant"" idea of developers to hide story details behind collectibles, I care about stories in my games, I couldn't ignore them) I started to dislike it by the endWhat was bad:-in-game ads! Crime in any game, doubly so in horror game, which lives and dies by it's atmosphere. ""On a way to finally end it all, destroy the darkness, save your wife? don't forget, this is really, really important! VERIZON!!!""-Shooting. It is tied to the story, yes, but as feature in a game, imho, it doesn't work that well. Your flashlight is like a laser sight in other games, except worse. You have to keep pointing it to the enemy, waiting till the game decides it wasted enough of your time and let's you deal damage.-Only 4 weapons - gun, shotgun (2 variants), hunting rifle and flaregun + flares and flashbang grenades, that's it-Few enemy types. Smaller dudes, bigger dudes, teleporting dudes, crows and poltergeist. Combined with limited weapons variety encounters get stale really fast and don't change in any way from beginning to the end-random encounters, like in some cheap old JRPG. About 5 (!) seconds after dealing with one group, another appears. Again and again. Combined with previous two points.. you get the picture. This got much better in second half of the game though-camera, in close areas, especially inside buildings, it really doesn't know what to do, cost me several retries-unlikable main character. Spoiled whiny diva, gets angry when he has problems with writing then gets angry at Alice for trying to help him. Also, pointing a gun at a sheriff, who just saved him, as answer for offered help? What an asshat!-story wasn't really engaging, ""save the princess"" with lots of talking, but nothing to make me care. And when everyone is a character in a book written by Wake, why worry if something happens to them? They aren't real anyway-Darkness as main antagonist. Just darkness, with some old woman's face, doing it's evil Darknessy things. No amount of cheap jumpscares makes it actually scary or interesting or anything but boring.-no sense of progression. Comparing with amazing Resident Evil 4 - you could chose the weapon you liked, chose what you wish to upgrade, make it yours (dat Red 9!). Here it's the same weapons all the time, with the game taking them away constantly, just because (for you to find them later casually laying around)+it looks good, night forest with trees swinging and shadows of the clouds running through. Pretty creepy+Night Springs stories were cool, until once the game tricked me showing ads instead - bye immersion!... I think that's it. Other things could be good, but left me disappointed or I got sick of them (combat) so they went to negatives.What could make it better? If Wake writes it, and it's a fiction, what stopped him to give himself some supernatural abilities maybe? He could add new ones with time, get better with old ones the more he used them. This could add new ways of dealing with enemies, and add new types of enemies with abilities to match. Why it only has to be possessed people, birds and stuff lying around, reanimated as poltergeist. Is it all ""the almighty Darkness"" can do?No random encounters, hell no. Enemies appear from nowhere and disappear into nothing when defeated, only to come back 5 seconds later, leaving you with a sense that they are there only to waste your time and ammunition.Also, don't start with combat 10 minutes in and then push it almost non-stop till the end - the town is beautiful (with Twin Peaks vibes), spend some time with it. game! Make Alan interact with townsfolk more, build an atmosphere. And then, gradually, with only hints and suspicions at first, go into horror mode.could add more but it's already a wall of text, nobody will read it all anyway, lolOverall, I understand why this game could be enjoyable to other people. Depends on how much the stuff I mentioned will bother you. I just couldn't ignore it all in the end. Could have been really good game, but Remedy wasted this opportunity			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games of all time. It's like a Stephen King book come to life. It manages to be very scary by preying on your fear of the dark without resorting to cheap jumpscares. I definitely recommend you play it.The story is filled with suspense and mystery, it's super engaging. It's heavily inspired by Twin Peaks, so fans of the show take the time to spot some easter eggs and find some thermoses filled with some damn good coffee. The soundtrack is awesome too. The ""light"" combat system this game utilizes is pretty neat, and although people say it can get repetitive, I think it's fun enough that it doesn't detract from the game. This is also one of the few games where playing on a harder difficulty can make the game harder without making it needlessly frustrating.I will list a few cons, however. This version is a console port, and this really really shows on older end machines. Luckily, most PCs today should be able to play it no problem. I can run it on highest settings at 60FPS on my GTX670 no problem, but the game doesn't visually seem like it would require as advanced a GPU as it actually does. The aiming and walking may also seem a bit wonky, but that's also a consequence of it being a console port.Overall rating: 9.5/10. I absolutely love everything about this game, but I gotta take half a point off for the issues stemming from it being a console port.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan wake is a linear story horror game. After reading some of the not recommended reviews, here is mine.People are hating this game because gameplay (espacially dodging from enemy attacks) are weird and camera controls are hard, enemies are all the same for 10 hours story therefore gameplay is repetitive, your inventory is limited to couple of choices and repeating each episode from scratch. They have a point. You have to consider these 3 downsides.On the other hand, i liked the atmosphere of the game. It reminds me of Alone in the Dark. Story is interesting. You are a writer stuck in his own book :D Man what were you thinking writing yourself in your own book :) The scripts are clichle but this is a horror game, so it is understandable. Visuals are awesome and game is optimized and does not produce frame drops. You can drive cars. The game is a little bit hard because of the controls but i played on easy and enjoyed it. Otherwise i would have hated it. There is not much soundtrack to talk about :DMy summary: Consider main cons of the game. But i can recommend it as a horror game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It had a sort-of sequel in Alan Wake's American Nightmare to tie up some loose ends in the plot.Unfortunately, the game was a victim of Ending DLC.  The actual ending to the game is divided, yes split down the middle, between two seperate DLCs named The Signal and The Writer.  There's really no excuse for that.Fortunately you can now get everything, American Nightmare and ending DLC, all at once for around $40 all togeather.  And I heavily recommend you do so.  Alan Wake could have been a spectacular series, it's just too bad Remedy succumbed to the Triple-A games fever rather than following FROM Software's incredibly sucessful example with the Souls games.

												Alan Wake is a psycological thriller made by the geniuses at Remedy Entertainment. The story is about Alan Wake, a writer who is having a hard time writing. He and his wife, Alice, goes to Bright Falls for a get away when thigns goes terribly wrong. Whitout giving spoilers, Alan has to save Alice. The story is really well told and kept me on the edge of my seat.The gameplay is interesting too. The game is a third person shooter where light is very important, The light undler lamp posts are safe spots and without the players flashlight, the enemies would have been invinsible. That is because the enemies are covered with darkness. the player has to burn the darkness away with a flashlight before being able to kill the enemies. The graphics are great and uses light and darkness in the enironment to great effect. The directos cut has all the DLC included and rounds off the story of Alan very nicely. Altought the stroy still isn`t completely told. The level design in the DLC is some of the most creative level design I have seen in a long time. P.S. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtrack in a game. It is something I listen to on a regular basis.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You need to use a flashlight to remove armor from the shadowcreatures and weapons to finnish them off. The game Was satisfying and quite a big challange. The story is alright, i kept getting stuck during the game and having to go to youtube to find out how to get past certain points. but overall it was a game i would reccomend to people who like good single player games. ++			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm gonna be honest - horror games are one of my least preferred games, partly because most of them uses bad controls/camera to scare you and partly because they scare all the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me :) Despite this, I'm a big Silent Hill 2 story/atmosphere fan, though I've always wanted to rip off my arms and eat them when I played SH2. Alan Wake is no doubt not a second Silent Hill 2, but it came very very close for me. It has really great and interesting story (2 dlc episodes are not that good, though), it has awesome atmosphere and feeling, music is great too (most of all - funny Poets of The Fall imaginary band). And most important for me - it has good camera and controls, so you can really enjoy this game. Remedy should do next Silent Hill with old Konami designers together. As usual, you'll find here classic Remedy humour and joke TV series across all the game (What better could be watched... in Night Springs), a few links to Max Payne.

												Simply put, Alan Wake plays like a Stephen King novel turned into a TV miniseries turned into a videogame. This is intentional by Remedy and this narrative complexity is one of the game’s strengths. Remedy has woven a very complex story into Alan Wake and that’s really half of the reason to play this game. The main story, told in episodes like a TV series, is about Alan piecing together what’s happened in his missing week while the ever-present darkness corrupts the townspeople and relentlessly pursues him. However during that missing week, Alan apparently wrote a pre-cognitive novel about the very events that are happening to him, because as you play you keep finding manuscript pages that he wrote and that describe everything that subsequently happens to him. These are a lot of fun to hunt out and collect because they explain the rather fragmented story and make you feel just as desperate and paranoid as Alan—groping in the dark for answers, desperate that the next chapter page will reveal the truth he needs.Blood and gore are so downplayed in Alan Wake as to be next to nonexistent. There are no chainsaw wielding psychopaths or bloodthirsty monsters—just the creeping darkness, and the unsettling things it does to the citizens of Bright Falls. People go missing in the woods and nobody sees this as unusual; later, when you’re lost in the woods, these missing people come after you, shrouded in oily shadows and out to gut you with whatever bladed implement they have handy.Alan is a writer, not a warrior, but he has his trusty flashlight and an assortment of small arms to beat back the Taken, as the infected townspeople are called. First you must aim Alan’s light at an enemy and boost its output to burn away the darkness, and then finish off the Taken with a few shots from your pistol or shotgun. It might sound repetitive but with multiple Taken emerging from the shadows and your flashlight dwindling, it can get pretty hectic as you juggle reloading your tiny snub-nose and popping fresh batteries into your light, all while running away from and dodging attacks. Later on you can get better lights and weapons, including flares to give you breathing room and flash bang grenades to clear an area, but ammo is usually scarce and you must balance exploration with your limited reserves.Everything in the PC version is essentially the same as the Xbox 360 version. Alan Wake is one of the best converted, least buggy PC ports I have played in a long time. The quirky characters and stark daylight sequences might temporarily pull you out of the terror, but the memories of wandering around in the woods, hounded by eldritch shadows, will haunt your nightmares for months to come.DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is ambitious if nothing else. It took the makers years to make (which included many delays), and there is clear evidence throughout the game that it was originally meant to be at least semi-open world rather than sectioned into levels. Once it did come out though, it heralded a new style of narrative with chapters played like episodes of a TV show, replete with visual summaries of the previous episode at the start of each of them. That desire to experiment with narrative in the game is easily the best part, and even though it's very heavily inspired by Stephen King, it's still a very original style for gaming and will keep you playing through even the dullest gameplay portions. And that's the main problem with Alan Wake, the gameplay. Now, that's not to say it's even that bad, it's actually pretty enjoyable and adds a lot of tension that really helps the game's atmosphere. The game even introduces new and interesting enemies for a while that keep you on your toes! But somewhere around the halfway point the game gets bored with introducing new gameplay elements, and of course shortly after that point you will too. The game really does start to drag towards the end, and if you're anything like me it will feel like a real grind to finish it and see what happens to the story. Aaaand then there's no satisfactory conclusion either. The game wants you to play the episodes that were released as DLC, but due to lukewarm reception (the game already got boring, and the DLC adds nothing while rewarding you with even less substantial story), they got cut short at just the 2. I should mention Alan Wake 2 is rumoured to be in the works, so there is that anyway.But to cut this short, Alan Wake is absolutely fantastic for half of the game, and then falls short towards the end. Despite this, it's frankly a must play for what it does right, so I recommend it for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Upon arrival to the cavern where you are staying, the lights go out and you need to turn the power back on. You hear Alice scream and you later rush back to the cabin to find she has disappeared. From then on you are trying to put together what has happened to Alice whilst progressing through the levels taking on chainsaw wielding, axe throwing, crazy ♥♥♥ maniacs. Only these maniacs aren't human. Bullets only hurt them if you remove the shadowy appiration from them using a flashlight, flash grenades or flares.

												This game is such an underrated gem. Nowadays its really hard to find game with good characters, solid storyline (without big holes in narrating), and unique combat system. Alan Wake got all this qualities. Probably combat system is the main feature of Alan Wake. Using flashlight on enemies and only after that shoot them makes this game real survival horror (specially when you are against few enemies). Variety of light weapon is impressing. Alan got different models of flashlights, flash grenades, flyers and etc. but at the same time only one revolver and and couple hunt rifles (proly i might forgot something  ᘳ º  ͜ʖ º ᘰ ). Thing that you dont have advanced military guns (like M4s or AKs) is also a great plus for survival horror game. The second best part of this game is a storyline. Hands down, Sam Lake and Ilkka Villi made a great job to create tension plot with cool and unique characters and well-written dialogues between them. Also pages that you can find all over the game explain big part of the plot and make dark'n'evil atmosphere. This game really held me till its end and truly recommend to everybody who did not try this game still. Regrettably this game was a victim of weird Microsoft policy. It was Xbox 360 exclusive for 2 years. In 2012 it finally came out on PC and developers were really impressed by the sales. Despite that whole sales numbers were low... That's one of the reasons why now we see Quantum break and not Allan Wake 2. P.S. After Alan Wake i have no doubts that Sam Lake is one my favourite writers in game industry.  P.P.S. Looking forward to Quantum Break. P.P.P.S. If you just like me are Shinji Mikami fan and you love Resident Evil series and Evil Within you must buy Alan Wake! └[◔.◔]┘			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake - AKA Alan Walk - is a game about this writer who fights against these creatures of darkness with a flashlight. This is a pretty epic since Alan can only run for 5 seconds before running out of stamina and the flashlight has battery life of 2 seconds. What makes this even more epic is the episodic nature in which you lose all your gear when advancing to new episode. You are in the limbo of awkward combat, bad fit and episodic nerf. ♥♥♥♥ yo♥♥♥♥♥♥big time. I can appreciate that. The art directing is pretty neato. Audiovisual execution can cause some chills -which is a good example of how decent the atmosphere of this game is. The horror ain't legit, nothing scary here nor are there cheap jumpscares either. The graphics were a huge surprise for me. I'd say around 17 times better than expected. Landscape simulator in a way. The ending songs also deserve a place in playlist. Good stuff there. I.e. The execution and atmosphere make up for the bad combat and lack of continuity this game suffers big time. Worth the sale price of 6 bucks or so. Don't reommend playing the console version because graphics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I stay away from most horror games, but this one is amazing. The game has an amazing atmosphere that makes you feel like you have something behind you waiting to kill you, it is extremely intense. The whole game is intense with some lighter areas ( people getting drunk, incidental stage explosions) the ending isn't satisfying but the rest of the story is great. The game Is structured as an tv show with recaps at the beginning of the episodes, it even says ""last time on alan wake"". This game isn't for the lighthearted but if you can handle it l, the game is worth it and the sound track is amazing. I would recommend the collectors edition to anyone who loves horror games or games with beautiful landscapes and an amazing story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a horror masterpiece. You've got inventive controls, a compelling story, interesting characters, and pacing that is absolutely to die for. It's really just a gem, that is a must play if you value story and pacing as much as good graphics and responsive controls. Whether you're a fan of horror or not, this game is fantastic.

												I played Alan Wake when it was released in 2010 on Xbox 360, I marathoned it, playing for entire days. Then when it was released on PC in 2012 I played through the DLC missions. Now that I upgraded to a 1440p monitor in 2016, I'm playing through the main game again. For a Direct X 10 game it's visually stunning, I love the steven kingesque story. Originally Alan Wake was going to be released on PC in 2010, I think it's annoying Microsoft made it an Xbox 360 exclusive for two years, but that version was pretty good too. If it takes an extra two years to polish the game I think they should, Alan Wake is one of the best games I've ever played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is okay as far as horror games go, however after the stellar initial impression, the repetitive nature of the gameplay detracts a lot from the overall experience. Presentation, visuals are excellent, the story is not very original, but it the game as a whole is definitely worth playing. The ending, as is often the case with stories that do not contain anything original, is a disappointment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a little slow to start but it gets going quickly and before the end of Episode 1 (which their are several more) you 'll  find you can't put it down. There's some great elements here most of them I can link to the Cult Classic by Sam Raimi, the manuscript the darkness floaring around, the people with the darkness.  It's not a shooter, theres an emphasis on tactics which I enjoyed (fight or flight). Most importantly the story is there, it's rich, original and keeps the gamer wondering why is this all happening at Bright falls (Warning you will experience Cliches often).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9.5 / 10BLUF: Fantastic story brought to life with great graphics and excellent gameplay.  Highly enjoyable throughout.I finally beat this game today after purchasing it four years ago for $7 on Steam.  You can really see that Remedy put a lot into the game.  The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is fun and exciting, and Remedy does a really fantastic job at bringing the story to life.The game does get progressively more difficult, and you will die a lot in the later levels, but it never has you pulling your hair out or tossing the controller.  Speaking of later levels, the final few chapters and the two DLCs have some really incredible set pieces and nightmare-invoking level designs.The environments are dark and eerie, and are augmented by really excellent sound effects and music.  The game is dark but it doesn't ever get Silent Hill dark.  The flashlight exploration and occasional jump scares do provide a good sense of dread, and the game can be quite scary if played alone at night.My only complaints: Seemingly pointless collectibles.  The in-game collectibles don't unlock any extras or special items or anything.  They pretty much only tell you that you've explored every nook and cranny of each level.The cliffhanger ending!  Unless Remedy makes a sequel, Alan Wake's story may never have a proper ending ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game. the play style is something you just do not see anymore with the current standard of games in this time. it has a very inconspicuous story line which consumes the player. The art style of the game distinguishes light and dark in a very effective way, by doing this the game developers have to focus as much on making the game scary because the element of darkness and the way that the darkness in conceived generates a sence of uncertainty in a person at the best of times. In conclusion Alen Wake is an amazing horror game and it has brought forth a resurrection if you will for the Genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game could have easily ended a few times before the real ending. What i am trying to say is the game lasted much longer then i expected it too.  The game itself was awesome. Some sounds in the game gave me goosebumps because of how creepy they were. Story was intersting and kept my interest. It was just challenging enough for me and the boss fights provided a lot of satisfaction once i beat them. The music was awesome too. Highly recommended. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There was something about this game when I started playing that captivated me! It was an interactive 'movie'; brilliantly acted and nothing like the interactive movie attempts game companies had tried in the past! This worked, and it drew you in like any good horror/supernatural movie should. The locales were nothing short of breath-taking, the soundtrack a professional and complete score, and an ambience that added to the polish of what promised to be a stunning piece of work!I honestly don't remember being so captivated by a storyline before. It was dark, sinister and had that air of mystery to it that would keep you turning it's pages were it a book. The interaction was clever, you found cut scenes perfectly interacting with clever mini game type action to move the story onward. It felt whole, it felt so, so promising! That is why I recommend it... But heres why I don't and most of these points boggle my mind:The animation is bordering on terrible when you consider the polish thats put into everything else, it looks terribly dated and it actually puts you back in mind of those old game development attempts at the interactive movie. Then comes the control system. The mouse feels weird, like it's floating in water and it takes you quite sometime to realise that the best way to make Alan move around the world is to follow an imaginary 'center' point, keeping your character from straying to his left. It's VERY disconcerting, even when your used to it and you find yourself constantly wishing it was chase camera view, or even better first person. Later when you have to fight multiple enemies you start to realise how terribly 'clunky' the whole control system feels. At one point where you have to dodge several enemies and a snow plough type truck, you find yourself swearing at the controls because it was them that made you die, because they didnt react quickly enough.And sadly, the repetition of killing 'shadow men/items' becomes boring very, very quickly.. I wasn't even out of act 3 before I started to groan at the way the game through me into yet ANOTHER forest with a long way to travel to safety.Alan Wake has always had great reviews and a massive following and I can see why, please don;t misunderstand. The problem with it is it's awful control system, and clunky key press responce. (and dont forget the animation which just ruins so much of the immersion and feel) So I do recommend this game, but be warned... It's gonna frustrate you.. Even on easy level. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is one of those games that you remember and enjoy because of the writing, the characters, the environment and the attention to detail. Remedy really nailed it with this one, I mean, four years later, the mountains, trees, grass, clothing, all of it looks outstanding with the texturing. The only objects that are outstandishly low res are books and readable stuff, like newspapers, which is ironic to me considering who the protagonist is, a writer.Anyway, the game boasts a wild premise, Alan Wake, a bestselling author is on vacation with his wife in the gorgeous Pacific north-west. They rent a cabin on a lake in a mysterious town, Bright Falls, and, essentially, a dark essense exists that wishes to exploit Alan Wake. So when Alan isn't looking, his wife falls into the lake by unusual circumstances. Despite Alan's efforts of jumping to help her, the next thing he remembers is waking up a week later in a car wreck. This is where the game gets interesting.Alan ends up learning how to fight the darkness, also known as the taken. Using flashlights, revolvers, pump shotguns, and hunting rifles. And the gunplay has Remedy written all over it, very cinematic and stylish with diving and avoiding axe and chainsaw, weilding taken. They're frightening, because some of them happen to be people you'd met earlier and disappeared under strange circumstances.Sam Lake, the head writer at Remedy, deserves all the credit for the direction which is gorgeous, cinematic and well edited. Plus, once you meet more characters, the more interesting the game gets. Without spoiling anything, just prepare for the Eye of Mordor.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:+ Revolutionary graphical performance. There are other games out there that are visually just as realistic, but they require a much more powerful hardware to run the game.+ Beautiful rich environment. The creators have put a lot of effort in making the scenery look true to life.+ The atmosphere is like out of a Stephen King movie. The environment is gloomy, dreadful, with hints of gothic. + The setting might resemble Silent Hill. As the lake takes on darker and darker dimensions you get suggestions to Lovecraftian cosmic horror. + Enemies are dreadful.+ The narrator's approach makes it easy to go into the character.+ Memorable and interesting npc's.+ Original approach to fighting (flashlight, light overall).+ Best map markers I've seen. It's as if there's an invisible dotted line all along your path. You never get lost.Cons:- Movement, though not bad, could have been even better. Especially jumpting from object to object took unnecsessary effort and precision.Conclusion:It's one of the most dreaded games I've played and a remarkable stepping stone in contemporary horror. The enemies seemed very scary in their simplicity and the battles turned out to be a real challenge. I really felt like I got a quality experience from playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had me on the edge of my seat on more than one occasion.  It's not really survival horror but there's a lot of suspense & thriller moments, then it just gets crazy towards the end.PROS-Very well done Story-Good 3rd person action-High Suspense & Good Comedy-Well Done Episodic ElementsCONS-A bit over dramatic at times-Gameplay is Repetitive-Ending gets crazySTORYI don't want to go into too much detail here since the story is really where this game shines the most.  Basically, you're a writer with writer's block & you move to a new town to get some insperation.  Then things start to go south real quick.  You start seeing wierd shadows that chase you & people think you're crazy, until they start chasing them as well.   Now you've got to find a way to stop the darkness from taking over the town.GAMEPLAYIf you've played any 3rd person shooter then this will come naturally for you.  The only difference is you have to weaken the enemies with your flash light before you can actually deal damage to them with your guns.  Light em up & then light them up again.  There are hidden collectables throughout each level that detail more of the game's story.  The game is also presented in episodic fashion but it's done fairly well.  Each chapter begins & ends with an intro & credit sequence like you're watching a TV Mini series.  Other than that the gameplay is pretty straight forward 3rd person action shooting at it's finest.OVERALLOverall, the game is enjoyable if a bit short.  There's not really much to it either other than flash light, shoot, repeat.  The best part of the game is the acting & story segments which also happen while shooting things which is what keeps you interested in playing it.  If it was just a shooter without a story it would be fairly mediocre but because the story is so well done it ranks it up a couple more notches.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This could be a mashup of KINGDOM HEARTS and BRAZIL(  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D6C0D42/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_Yt6Gtb0HS93VK ). With the protaganist as ""darkness"" and the twisty story line of BRAZIL - as who is really who, and are we playing the author? The character OF the author, or another author writing the author thats making an author? The game is divided up into 6 episoded complete with "".. last time on Alan Wake..."" to perpetuate the next episode. Almost all of the episodes ended with a cliff hanger, that made you wonder, OK, now what just happened, but it darts off into another direction in the next.Combat, while repetitive - shine light to eliminate the darkness withing, the shoot them, is not boring at all, and is appropiately place. Never was there a time when I was plahying when it felt like - ""... another fight gawd!!"", instead, it was more like, omg, I get to get through here... and then comence your ""tippy toe"" around the forest.The storyline is very similar to the style of BRAZIL, where you are not sure who is who. and even the end of the game does NOTHING to clear this up. While I did play the American Nightmre, I was nothing like the first. It seemed to loose focus of the story, an dinstead spend too much time on combat and new weapons.  The riffle, handgun and an occasional flare gun was the perfect weapons for the game. AWAN, was just getting a little out of the genre.  And I felt good just leaving it as it was. Not knowing what I was playing was the best compliment you can give a writer of a suspensful thriller.If you like a lot of FPS action, but a nice story driven (in my opinion, this stoyr can keep up with BIOSHOCK INFINITE on a different level), take a look at this game. Don't judge it yet for what it ""appears"" to be. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is proof positive of the point that a story, properly told transcends all media and genres. A game that could be EASILY adapted for film or TV, Alan Wake is a game that is, in actuality, an interactive novel, and one that is just BEGGING for Star Trek's holodeck. Even in the intro sequence I found myself enjoying the game on a level that I have not enjoyed any other game before. Does that mean it's my favourite game? No. But even still it is a wonderful experience nonetheless. Even the fairly standard horror pacing and formula can't detract from this game, and so intricately tied to and interwoven with its plot the game really manages to tell a story while you battle shadow monsters with a Christmas light wearing sidekick (I am NOT making this up). While I am not a fan of the horror genre, and have never really read any Stephen King (to whom the tilts it's hat many times), the game was nevertheless thoroughly enjoyable. The only down-side to this interactive novel is that like a novel it is not immediately replayable. When you get to the last chapter, you don't feel any pressing need to start over again from the beginning, because what you have really enjoyed is not the thrill of the chase, being hunted by an insidious Lovecraftian shadow-demon, but the content of that story. But I think that is one negative we can all bear if games of this ilk were to become more common in the future. And really that actually makes the gameplay longer lasting easier to savour. Please Remedy, and ALL developers, give us more interactive novels, and less psychotically emotionless space marines killing freaking zombie demons from outer space.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's like Stephen King wrote Silent Hill. It's like Mafia II and The Darkness had a baby.   The perfect treat for fans of Stephen King's writing and psychological horror. You want an engrossing storyline, likeable characters, amazing soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, the feeling like you're literally playing a book? This game delivers.There are a few issues with this game like repetitive combat, and combat situations become a bit predictable the further you are in the game, but overall, the pros outweight the cons. Highly recommended, even if you're not a big fan of horror, but enjoy a good story.PS: I'd recommend avoiding DLC's (aka ""Special"" episodes) altogether as they somewhat ruin the perfect (imo) ending of the game.

												I'll make this quick, Alan Wake is not an easy game to play and it does have a few things that can frustrate the player but the story here reminds you of Silent Hill. It's not a Silent Hill clone per se, but a fresh take of the horror genre even though there's not much horror here.Gameplay:Enemies here are called the Taken. They are essentially human beings that have been taken over by the darkness. Unfortunately, they are practically invincible. You can't kill them with gunshots if they still have darkness within them. Here you will quickly learn that your worst enemy is your flashlight. To kill the Taken you have to shine your light at them making them vulnerable to gunshots. However, if you run out of batteries (which will happen often even on the normal setting) you are almost guaranteed to die. The dodging mechanic doesn't really help you much because as soon as the enemy hits you, you are unable to do anything. They pretty much stun you into submission and this will happen a lot when the game decides to throw groups of Taken at you. There are tools that can help you evade these groups such as the flares, flare gun and the flashbangs. These are uncommon but very useful items. The game forces you to create a tactic in which you decide whether you want to run or fight. This game is definitely not easy and during my playthrough (on normal, which is the hard mode of this game) I died at least 7-10 times.Graphics:The graphics here are nothing special but the scenery and the mountains will take your breathe away. Remedy has put a lot of attention to detail in the way they create this world and the little town of Bright Falls, and even to the surreal world of the Dark Place. The characters you encounter have their own set of personalities which sets them apart from any other characters. They aren't just NPC's here, they actually feel alive. More often than not, they will actually help you survive groups of Taken in some Episodes. Let me tell you that they don't miss!Controls:The controls feel stiff and that really doesn't help in surviving the night. As I said before dodging kind of sucks as Alan will only take two steps the the direction you want to dodge and if you don't time it right, the enemy will hit you. In fact its better to fight from a distance. Stay away from large groups! There is no reticle for aiming so you will miss a couple of shots. This isn't a first person shooter and therefore you can't look down the barrel of the gun. Running also can kill you if you run out of breathe. No stamina means that Alan will walk slower and aim his flashlight much slower. Another thing too is that running is pointless since the Taken can run much faster than you. Unless you are standing 5 feet from the next checkpoint, running away is near impossible. Overall: Did I say I was gonna make this quick? Ooops....Alan Wake is not for everyone. It is definitely not an easy game to beat and the controls don't help it much. It is clear that Remedy has put a lot of thought into the mechanics of the game but I felt like I was being hindered which in this case as a survival horror game it did well to keep me on my toes. Every death felt cheap but not cheap enough to get me to rage quit. Eventually I understood why I died and I grew to like this game even more. Now the story portion is what attracts everyone to this game and I'm glad to say that it did not disappoint. Alan Wake is an episodic adventure and it was meant to be treated as such. If you like a good challenge and a good story, then this is the game for you. However, that being said expect a lot of deaths and instances of frustration!                                    -7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake isn't a flawless game.It has an awkward combat system, the plot pacing is a little off and the character models are rather odd.And yet, Alan has this unique spark of light that pushes you forward throughout the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wakey wakey Alaaaan. This game has a dark, eerie setting that predominantly takes place in a forest surrounding Cauldron Lake where you come across an evil force known as the Taken. This evil can possess both human beings and inanimate objects in a bid to put Alan to sleep, for good. Thankfully, one of Alan's weapons is a torch light, which literally burns the darkness layer protecting the possessed. Once this layer is burned, then it's weapons free till the assailant fades to nothing. The AI is very good. They'll come at you in numbers, throw weapons at you, spread out and try to flank you and even call in the heavies that can take twice [if not more] the damage. You can try dodging their attacks or run away, though you will not get far at all - they will catch you and hurt you plenty. SO! That leaves you with an offensive defense option - FIGHT. Other than your torch, you have an arsenal of weapons such as a revolver, shotgun and hunting rifle as well as tactical equipment such as flares and flash bangs. Not to mention the flare gun. Choose however you want to attack. Ammo is readily available [I played Normal game mode]. There are no med packs and your health bar renegrates slowly. So if you're not careful with your six, you could be in trouble. Finally, you have some safe havens, such as a lit lamp post to catch your breath.The graphics are fantastic. The setting is beautiful. The lighting is very good, though can hurt the eye so you may need to turn that brightness down or play in a well lit room. Although, I would highly recommend playing in the dark with the headphones on. Huge emphasis on the story and is an interesting story. Definitely has that Japanese horror feel to it. It did feel as though the developers dragged on a bit with the gameplay to prolong the game, but I think the story covered it well. A must play. 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Would definitely recommend this game. Only improvement that could be made is the fact that after a while the enemies and scares become quite predictable, if they could be mixed up more the gameplay would be absolutely amazing.

Alan Wake: a unique, horror themed casual-action game.Alan Wake is a self-aware, chapter based, mainly combat-driven action game that anyone could get into. Personally I recommend that you play on easy, because if there is one downside to the game, it's that the combat system wears you down after the whole experience. There's also a difficulty spike right at the mine, but it's not too bad. The game isn't scary, but does have a light v. dark sort of theme.It's also kid-friendly, for the most part.Alan Wake's story reminds me of a Steven King novel (Wake himself makes the comparison). A writer comes to an old small-town cabin to get away from the fame and fortune. He runs into some issues, and his wife (who fears the dark) is captured by some darkness-something-or-another. It's pretty cool and non-complex, but mysterious enough to remain intriguing. The entire game is narrated by Alan Wake, in the form of a novel, while you traverse the dark countryside.Combat is simple. Fight the nightmare-men by getting rid of their (as I call them) ""darkness shields"" then shooting them. Their darkness shields are shown by a circle of lense flare when you aim your flashlight at them. Shoot them with either the revolver or shotgun to kill them. Alternatively, flare guns do both simultaneously. Flares and flashbangs clear crowds.Fight men from your dreams (and people you have met) through a story with cool bits of radio and TV clips.The story is good, but unfortunately to prevent the game from being a 5 hour experience, there's a lot of repetitive combat. Some people really like it, but in my opinion it could have been a bit shorter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great horror/thriller game, I recommend it.The game is presented in episodes like a TV show, where after you start a new chapter, it gives you a ""Previously on: Alan Wake"" cutscene of previous events of the past episode.Graphics is pretty good but facial expressions could use some improvement.Gameplay however is where it shines, the game is a mix between Resident Evil's third person shooting and The Walking Dead's story telling.

												A fairly underestimated and undiscovered gem, this game follows the story of Alan Wake, an American writer with writer's block and terrifying nightmares. The game has a few downsides, such as a slightly inaccurate combat system and sometimes overly strong enemies. However, if you see this game through despite the lacking combat, it is a definite winner. A simply gorgeous setting in Bright Falls, fluent movements, not a single loading screen while entering homes and an utterly scary story and you have yourself a rock-solid game. Worth every penny.

												Alan Wake is one of those games that aren't for everyone but I enjoyed very much from start to finish. The game builds a dark tone that goes along well with it's story. The gameplay, though basic, is done well as you use a gun (Pistol, Shotgun, and more) to fend off against the enemies that can only be damaged after being weakend by light (Flashlight or Lanturn). One of the few downsides I had  with this game was that it ended on a cliffhanger with currently no plans for sequel (One has been pitched but since has been officially cancelled). I still highly recommend this game to anyone interested in a great story!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Had this one in my library for a while before playing it.  It was honestly not quite what I expected, but not in a bad way.  Sure it had all the weird mind trickery of the twisted/mad writer sort of deal, but mix in a good dose of twin peaks weirdness, a shake or two of stephen king (quite knowingly), an overall stronger than anticipated sense of 'place' for a weird little north western tale, a touch of silent hill here or there, and really I came away fairly impressed.  Combat mechanics were not always the most spot on, but really combat is a correlary to the story not the overal purpose of playing, and it all kinda smoothed out well.  Much more cerebral than some more 'gore/shock/terror' survival horror types, with a nod and a wink at the appropriate times to the genre.(8.5/10)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I bought Alan Wake at the last Steam winter sale I wasn't really sure what I could expect from this game, but I have to admit I was surprised in a positive way.As many people said, Alan Wake can lose some of it's atmosphere after you played some time, because the game mechanics are always the same and basicly you do the whole time the same thing: lightling enemys with a torch light, then shooting them- or just shooting them with a flare gun- and sometimes solving really easy puzzles, e.g. open a gate or lighting some rocks to make arrows visible, who show hidden treasures where you can get a new weapon or muntion and batteries.Alan Wake's soundtrack fits the atmosphere perfectly, the synchronisation of the main character tells the plot in a capturing, exiting way and the story created many moments of fear inside of me. All the time I hoped with Alan Wake that he'd find his wife and make his way back home.You can play the game in three levels of difficulty.There's lot of things to earn and collect: avatars, backgrounds for your steam profile, trading cards... In an statistics window you are able to see how many enemys you killed with wich weapon, what you've already discoverd and what you still can find. This makes the game nice to repeat.All in all Alan Wake is a capturing, not really difficult but fascinating horror game, which I really enjoyed playing and if you're not overrating the gameplay variations I bet you will too.

												There is something about this game that just feels like you are playing a Steven King book. Things I liked:+The action is fun -- The combat is pretty simple but they do a lot to mix up the combat. You feel fragile, so it's tense, but the enemies aren't insurmountable either, so it's a very nice balance.+The atmosphere is amazing. -- As mentioned you actually feel like you are a character within some kind of horror book. I don't know how they did it, but it's spot on.Things I didn't like:-The game is a little too long to not add new elements or progression -- The game is long because the story is long, so that part isn't bad. It would have made the gameplay grow a little less stale towards the end if they had maybe incorporated some minor progression system or a couple extra weapons just to switch things up as you are tying it all together.All in all, must check this game out, it's fantastic.

												Alan Wake is one of the most enjoyably written games I've played in a long time, and I typically enjoy story most in games. There's enough horror thrills, suspense and tension to make you occassionally not want to leave areas you know are safe but developing the story kept drawing me forward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I suppose I'll start this review off by saying I really didn't want to reccommend this game, but because I ""sort of enjoyed it enough to play it twice I guess"", then I shall. It's an impressive game, but this is going to be a very critical review. I find people get more out of a review if it states somethings faults rather than its values, so that is what I will do here.In this game you play as Alan Wake, an acclaimed but troubled writer who hasn't written a word in years, who is brought to the remote town of Bright Falls by his wife in the hope that he can find some inspiration for writing. This all goes disastrously wrong and results in Alan trying to save his wife from a dark evil presence. (hoorah)The story is clearly the winning point of the game, I mean it's kinda hard to avoid when your main character is a writer. Theres little bumps and bits that spark a lot of questions along the way, but it's always interesting enough to keep your fullest attention and wanting to find out whats next.The problem with this game is the lack of balance between the excitement of the story compared with the gameplay. The majority of the game pans out like this-1. Oh look its a really cool story, I want to know more2. Oh dear...looks like I have to walk around a forest for an hour shooting things until I'm given the next part of the story.3. Wash rinse repeatI would have no problem with this method, a lot of games do it well. But this game just butchers it.The gameplay consists of shining a light at enemies, and shooting them. It's an interesting concept, but becomes boring after a while, and by the time midgame comes you're only shooting things to find out what happens next. It becomes a chore, and just no fun. It's as if a writer who knew nothing about videogames wanted to make a videogame, that's the kind of vibe I get from this.Another note I have to make about this game is the difficulty. When you load the game, you're given the options of easy, normal and nightmare. Wanting to play the game as it should be, I play on normal for two playthroughs. I didn't find it difficult, I found it frustrating. Deaths were always unfair, you were punished for exploring, and in the early game ammo was often non existent in certain areas of a level. Combine this with the fact that this is a story driven game, it doesn't pile up to much fun. After my troubles, I looked online to see if others had similar problems as me and I came across something that triggered a facepalm.The difficulty levels on consoles and pc are labeled differently. On the console, the difficulties are labeled normal, hard, and nightmare, where as on the pc they are labeled easy, normal, and nightmare respectively. Keep in mind that they are the same difficulty, simply labeled different. This means that when I was playing what I thought was normal mode, it was actually set to hard. I even got the ""complete in hard mode"" achievement on steam. Whether this was deliberate or a mistake, either way it should be made more clear to anyone playing the game. Still, for a hard mode it wasn't fun, it was just frustrating. I'd hate to think what nightmare would be like.Like I said at the top of this review, this is a good game, but I was going to critical, and I have been. It runs amazing, it looks amazing, it has an amazing story, let down by less than amazing gameplay and truly faulty mechanics.This game is constantly on sale for 90% off, that's 2.99 euros. When that time comes, buy it if you so wish. If not, leave it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SPOILER FREE. You're running through the forest- gasping for air, a revolver in your left hand, flashlight in the right,  low on ammunition and batteries, with enemies behind you, too many- swarming, coming closer. You won't get far. You narrowly dodge an axe swing, only to have to keep running- not being able to stop and catch your breath-Then you see it.Your safe haven. The one true friend in this cold, desolate and horrifying region. The one thing that can save you from the monsters that chase behind you.You step in- into the light. You catch your breath, and look up at the lamp above you, sighing. Knowing you cannot stay inside this heaven. You keep going.. until it's over. Until the light comes. And your story continues. Until it cannot continue anymore. You're on a crazy rollercoaster, with many twists, turns, and drops. But eventually it ends. It all ends, and the light consumes the dark. Contrast.Alan wake is definitely an intriguing game- concepts I haven't seen much of, though I've been told by one friend the light/darkness system is reminiscent of ''Alone in the Dark.''The combat system is like this- you have a flashlight which destroys the darkness surrounding the ''Taken.'' The monsters in this game. You are then able to shoot them, after first destroying this games concept of a shield. The weapons in this game are powerful- enough to take out the enemies, sure. However, sometimes you get (no pun intended) taken over by the enemy. And your only choice is to run into the light. Your choice of weapons in this game are as followed as found during the storyline: Revolver, Shotgun, Pump Action Shotgun, Hunting Rifle, Flare gun.My preference for using these weapons were this- if I had to take care of the Flankers, (the ones with a sickle, or axe, that attack rapidly) I'd use the Revolver primarily, considering, if you shine the flashlight on them and then shoot them with the Revolver they usually die with one bullet. For the Common Taken, if I got overrun I'd use a flare and drop it to give myself room, and shoot them with the shotgun. But the revolver still was my primary.For the Tele-taken, (the ones that teleport) I would stand, and wait for them to lunge towards me, quickly turn to them, and shine the flashlight on them until their darkness was gone, and then shotgun blast them. For the Assault Taken, (the ones with the chainsaws) I would either run, use a flashbang to help lower their shield then take them out, or flares. The Ravens that attack, I would just shoot the swarm with flares, and they would dissipate, but you also can use the various flashlights throughout the game to take them.This game also has Poltergeists, which I recommend running from because they have the ability to throw objects at you- whether it be a tree, a car, or anything of the sorts. But if you want to stay on the offensive, use the flares to give you some room, and shine the light on the objects and they will disappear. There is also liquid Taken, which looks like black goo, and if you step it, it instantly takes damage. Shine your flashlight on it, and they'll be gone. Just look out, however for it. At one point when in the forest, there are also bear traps, and if you're not careful your own book will become your demise.There's many different flashlights in this game- and the better the flashlight, the more you'll have to be careful about how many batteries you use. Along with ammunition, you should do your best to conserve. However, the good thing is that ammunition and batteries and all of those commodities aren't scarce- but in the heat of combat, you DO NOT want to run out of resources.The storyline goes like this- you are Alan Wake. Horror novelist. You haven't been able to write a book in 2 years because of writer's block. Your  friend, and agent Barry Wheeler has suggested you take a vacation to clear your mind. And your wife Alice has arranged for it. You're going to Washington State, into the town of Brightfalls. You arrive at the cabin, and your wife tells you that she arranged for the trip to try and help you get over your inability to write. You storm out, and then look back at your cabin to see that your wife is being taken into the lake by a mysterious force- in this game, your main objective is to save your wife, rewrite the story, and defend your friends and yourself against 'The Darkness.' (I'm not spoiling anything, that's the main few points though.) You'll travel through the mountains, near the lake, over logs on a river, into desolate and empty towns filled with darkness waiting for you, a gas station- many MANY locales all in this one region.The storyline is beautifully written in my opinion- it's sublime, the pacing is good- you do sometimes get the feeling of Deja Vu when the game does something over- or you see something play out in a different way. There are lots of twists, and honestly, a lot of it is nonsensical, however, it is poetic, the dialogue is well written and funny- there are light tones with the characters speaking, such as your Agent Barry joking around, to help contrast the threat you're up against. There are dark parts of the dialogue, bright, and humorous, it's very diverse, in a well thought out and intriguing way that makes you keep coming back for more. There also are manuscripts you'll find yourself collecting throughout the storyline- they're enjoyable to collect, because they tell you how a character feels, what comes next, or valuable storyline information, and Alan's thoughts. Keep in mind, all of the manuscripts in this game are read by the character of Alan Wake. The soundtrack to this game is beautifully- fitting, and haunting in certain parts of the storyline. Definitely one of my favorite soundtracks for a game. At one point, you also have a song incorporated into the game by a record player, that tells you a certain thing you have to do. The graphics to this game also looked very pretty, and serene and induced shivers at some points in it. Having it foggy- and a tele-taken teleporting around you and you can't see where they are is definitely a thrilling and slightly chilling experience. The facial animations are lacking in certain spots, such as Alan's eyebrows. But, I thought overall the graphics did this game well. I felt the atmosphere, felt like I lived it, and it made the game that much more successful for me. The negative I can think of- is that over the time I spent beating this game, the combat gets very repetitive, and the running sequences and certain assault sections. I had to take breaks to get through it, albeit short breaks. Also, because of the dark and light and the various shadows, I found, if you over play it like I did, you can actually get a headache. However, that's probably just me. Another negative is that I thought that there isn't much characterization- from the start to beginning, I didn't think Alan grew too much as a character. And pretty much every character seemed stagnant. That isn't to say this game isn't beautifully haunting, with it's atmosphere, storyline and twists and turns. This game is great, and one of my favorites as of right now. If you're looking for a storyline driven game, with Stephen King esque horror elements, go for it. The combat can be repetitive, but it is fun nonetheless. The characters are good, the different enviroments are diverse, and eerie, and at the same time beautiful.Overall an enjoyable experience, I'd definitely buy it again. Over and out.(Hope you enjoyed my review)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a Narative thriller that really feels more like reading a novel than playing a game. Fitting considering that the main character is an author that need his writing spirit reawakended. the storyline is excellent, the gameplay, especially the use of light as a weapon, and the flow of the combat is excellent. This is also one of the best console ports I've seen and it's a model for how the rest of the industry should do theirs.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake has horrible combat, and the gameplay is otherwise repetitive as♥♥♥♥♥♥ yet somehow I've poured hours into this game. Here's the deal, if you like games with good combat and gameplay but an underdeveloped environment and story you won't like this game. What makes this game good is the environment and the story, now I suppose neither of these are really outstanding but they still hold up and make this game unique. Chances are you'll enjoy the game, but if all your looking for is something with good 3rd person combat, this is not it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a third-person shooter with a narrative focus essentially. You play through a story-come-to-life that Alan himself wrote. The actual gameplay is supposed to be leaning towards the horror genre but you have a gun so all fear is lost. The key mechanic is that the enemies you face are shadow people and in order to kill them you first have to break their ""shields"" by shining your flashlight at them. From a gameplay perspective, Alan Wake is pretty straight forward but competent. The real meat of the game, however, is the intense narrative driving the campaign forward.Personally this is one of those games I put on easy mode and immerse myself in the underlying plot, and from my time so far I really enjoy it.

												Alan Wake is one of those games that aren't for everyone but I enjoyed very much from start to finish. The game builds a dark tone that goes along well with it's story. The gameplay, though basic, is done well as you use a gun (Pistol, Shotgun, and more) to fend off against the enemies that can only be damaged after being weakend by light (Flashlight or Lanturn). One of the few downsides I had  with this game was that it ended on a cliffhanger with currently no plans for sequel (One has been pitched but since has been officially cancelled). I still highly recommend this game to anyone interested in a great story!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game, but the story is a mess and the game itself is a little bit heavy on the combat side. I've got to a point where, instead of being scared of the monsters, I was being annoyed by them. Combat every single minute. That's definitely the worst part of the game. On the good side, the setting is amazing (countryside) and the support characters are cool (I love you Barry).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fairly underestimated and undiscovered gem, this game follows the story of Alan Wake, an American writer with writer's block and terrifying nightmares. The game has a few downsides, such as a slightly inaccurate combat system and sometimes overly strong enemies. However, if you see this game through despite the lacking combat, it is a definite winner. A simply gorgeous setting in Bright Falls, fluent movements, not a single loading screen while entering homes and an utterly scary story and you have yourself a rock-solid game. Worth every penny.

												This game definitely isn't for everyone, so keep that in mind when thinking of making your purchase. But if you love sci-fi, horror, Stephen King, and action/adventure games...then you should definitely check it out. I loved all the Stephen King references, the depth of the story, and the thriller aspects of it. The combat was well done (much better than most horror games) but did get a bit repetitive due to the fact of how much there was of it. The game is mostly combat with story scenes in-between. That's really my only complaint, too much combat. The story definitely makes you think and you constantly have this un-nerving type feeling. So glad I got it and definitely plan to play American Nightmare next.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Alan Wake has it all if you looking for a story game. The soundtrack on the game are a blast because they have all sort of music but it leans more on the rock/blues style and that is very awesome. As i said, great shooting mechanics, smooth gameplay. strong story, stunning graphics ans brutal soundtrack  makes Alan Wake a great experience, it's a very memorable game and there are some scenes that you just can't forget.

Amazing story, fair graphics, fun gameplay and interesting characters.Also, if you're Latin American, there is a full audio support for Latin American spanish, instead of the awful and classic spanish from Spain.Plus, I think that this is one of the few games that the DLC's actually take part in the story and complete it. Once you're through the main story, it's a must to play ""The signal"" and ""The Writter"" DLC's. They're, just like the game, totally amazing.If you want to experience a really good story, just buy it, sit back and enjoy the ride.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is probably one of the most cleverly written games that I have ever played. I didn't have high expectations for this game and just assumed originally that it would follow some typical horror game tropes and just be something I played through only because I bought it.As the story progresses things become far more complex and by the ending there are a wealth of questions that need to be anwered and several possibilities of what is actually happening in this world.Unfortunately, we probably won't ever get much beyond American Nightmare so we may unfortunately never finish this possibly incredible storyline.

												""Alan Wake"" is a great game with a great and invigorating story. I really liked playing Alan and fighting the dark the best i could. The contrast between the darkness and the light creates an interesting and also a bit frightening atmosphere. There are just a few offense horrorelements but loads of psychological things confusing and shocking the player.Great game with only one littel problem. I have to say, that the Mobs u are fighing getting boring fast. There are only a few different types of enemies and they arent changing. Getting to the end the creators just put more and more enemies in your way but that doesent make it more difficult than a bit exhausting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What started off as an impulse purchase became (without exaggeration) one of the most amazing gaming experiences in my life. Alan Wake is an outstanding game that mixes elements of psychological horror, thriller and and dark fantasy. Bright Falls are a perfect setting for the story of a dark, somewhat magical, entity going after the protagonist. It also features a lot of meta-elements (like the manuscript pages the protagonist finds scattered throughout the game, which give us insight into the plot and, in some cases, the events that are about to occur or which we do not see on-screen).As for the gaming aspect: although some might find the combat monotonous, I personally always get the cold shiver each time Alan steps into a secluded part of the forest that's bound to hide malavolent lurkers. The limited amunnition and the character's poor stamina add an extra spice to the gameplay, but the developers made sure that you are able to get to the next chekpoint even with no bullets left in the barrel (alhough it's much harder). The fights are not quite scary nor horror, as the game even hints that there are enemies inbound, but is definitely adrenaline packed and fun.The story is well-crafted, and the narration helps bring it to life. The entire plot is a huge nod to Stephen King and a myriad of other contemporary horror writers. There are a lot of references to ""The Shining,"" ""The Twilight Zone"" ""The Birds,"" ""Poltergeist"" and ""Lost"" scattered throughout the game. The dialogues are neither superficial nor superflous, and I used to spen an extra minute or two to hear out some of the characters (who sometimes provided a crutial hint for the later story development). The division into episodes, the different songs at the end of each stage and the ""Previously on Alan Wake"" cutscenes help make Alan Wake feel like a TV show you don't want to miss at any cost, so you keep coming back for more.To conclude, I beleive that this game is definitely worth both your time and your money. It's fun and has a lot of replay value, especially when you have the commentary feature that comes with the collectors edition. Recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing flare simulator with a genuinely interesting story and a very nice atmoshpere. Action parts are perhaps too numerous and too mechanically simple. The last new enemy and last new weapons are introduced about 3 hours into the game and after that gameplay formula doesn't change for another 8-10 hours, which makes the game a bit of a drag at times. Burning the same zombie guys again and again and again is only entertaining for so long. Worth playing if you enjoy a good narrative and are willing to deal with less than stellar gameplay. I liked it enuff to write a review, so that's definitely something. Probably best consumed in small doses though - an episode a day or so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are very few games that I go back and replay immediately after finishing them, but Alan Wake is such a game. This is the survival horror genre done impeccably well and worth every cent of it's asking price.RIGHT: Alan Wake is a story driven horror game shot over the shoulder, RE4 style. And though the plot is very twisting, it's not difficult to follow or over laden with cut scenes. It takes great pains to stay true to it's own world, with the protagonist saddled with all the gifts and foibles a middle aged author would have battling the supernatural. The characters are engaging and well developed, with only one exception that I will discuss later. Combat is not only well executed but also ingenious, making a flashlight your primary means of defense, with any fire arms becoming secondary. Alan's aim is imperfect but realistic and not burdensome, adding to the air of horror as you are only as good as a man who was suddenly thrust into extraneous circumstance. Controls are fluid and well plotted for both keyboard and Xbox game pad. Though the game has a climb function, the detection is perfectly controlled so you wont be grabbing every ledge you bump into. You can also fall and take damage, but again the game is so well plotted out that you almost have to be purposely trying to harm yourself for it to be an issue. The overall design of this game is such that it creates a mood, aiding the story elements and hammering home the ""light vs dark"" theme and just immerses you into Alan's rapidly disintegrating world.  Even the “Night Springs” and late night radio bits are done so well, you don't mind taking a small break from game play to watch and listen.WRONG: I really have only one complaint about this game, and it revolves around Alan's wife. Where every character in this game is perfectly sculpted for their role, even if you only see them for mere moments, Alan's wife who is the motivation behind the protagonist’s progression in the plot, is incredibly vapid and pointless! I mean this woman is beyond insufferable, her character is so completely empty and uninteresting, I could almost believe she is based on a real person rather than written for the purpose of a game. When she isn't whimpering about being afraid of the dark, she's badgering the man that obviously supports her floundering liberal arts carrier and even goes so far as to check Alan into a mental institution when it looks like he wont be providing her with a fat pay cheque from his writing anymore. She's monosyllabic and completely vanilla to the point I think even the voice actress realizes it and phones in her performance. I completed the game yesterday, and as of this moment I can't even tell you her name because she is so uninteresting I've already forgotten it. Lucy? Lisa? Lara? Who cares... Anyway, Alan is confronted at every turn in this story by what a horrid ♥♥♥♥♥ he's married, but somehow comes to the conclusion that he's to blame by being more successful than she is! So obviously the only was to fix this is to save her from the darkness and maybe he can be worthy enough to coexist with probably one of the most worthless women on the planet. In all seriousness, Alan's wife is pure plot device and nothing else, though I am at a loss as to see why they chose to make the only undeveloped character, such a major part of the story and motivation. Was an elder creature trying to control Alan's creative ability to write itself into existence and destroy reality, not enough motivation for him to go on this journey?Well, that being said, Alan Wake is still one of the best if not THE best survival horror game I have played. It does everything right, and has enough of a difficulty curve to make you want to go back and try playing it again on more challenging settings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Only improvement that could be made is the fact that after a while the enemies and scares become quite predictable, if they could be mixed up more the gameplay would be absolutely amazing.

												An interesting game no doubt... but quite repetitive..The story is interesting but sometimes confusing... it is however, unique... i doubt you played or will play a game with a story like this 1...From the gameplay point, this game is a shooter though not an fps and not 1 focused on multiple weapons and upgrades..  it gives you a few weapons and focuses on a specific mechanic in order to kill enemies... So for those that like ""do this then that"" to kill something.. well this is the game for you.It offers a challenge and i must admit i actually died a couple of times in normal difficulty... there is a creepy aura, that aint exactly frightning but unsettling... So while it may not satisfy amnesia or outlast fans, it will get fear fans going. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is one of those games that really surprised me of how good atmosphere can really be!It's about a writer dude that comes to Bright Falls with his wife to get rid of his writers blockage and to get some hot wifey action on a lake in a boat (but they never tell you that)..Ofcourse,♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan and some misterios, unexplained events happen, his wife is missing, everyone think he killed her, but few townsfolk actually have some hints on what is going on there.. As the story develops, you learn about similar events that happen before and about Alan's troublesome past..Game is action/adventure survival, in third person view that doesn't have that much adventure puzzles in it, it's more of enjoying the story as it builds up from chapter to chapter with great cut scenes that are directly in the game.. Sometimes you really can't tell if Alan is crazy, imagining things or things he is going through are actually real! Game is divided in 6 chapters and 2 special features that furter explains the story behind Bright Falls and bla bla spoilers..PRO- incredible atmosphere, heavily influenced by Twilight Zone, one of the best TV psychological horror show..- Graphics and scenery, game is spread over a town Bright Falls, mountain, cabin on the lake, roads, many awesome places, a lodge, old sawmill, farm etc.- gameplay is smooth and enticing, story is very well paced and delivered and for once, there are not many logical errors..- sounds and music are very good made, music get little wilder when you fight enemies, and all that clasic♥♥♥♥♥♥hehe- weapons and stuff are very well made, there are few clasic weapons like pistol, shotty, flare gun, flares, and as you play, you really don't need much to think about saving ammo, there are plenty (until you play on hard or nightmare mode :)CONS- controls are somewhat ""slow"" i.e. Alan needs few steps to stop or slow down, which is actually realistic but it can be problem when he doesn't stop when you want him to,- field of view, to my liking, is somewhat to close to main character, so you can't really ""see"" what is behind you.SHOULD I PLAY IT?Yeah, especially if you are into psychological horor games and liked to watch twilight zone (NOT SAGA), or any kind of survival game like Silent Hill (all of them :) especially SH2!, in some degree Resident Evil (first 3 parts, rest of them didn't quite fell good on me)..Something that really made this game excellent in my mind is as you ""approach"" the ending of the game, events get really weird/crazy with very good subcontext about whole plot, with many details that gives you small hints about Alan psyche and people around him (his wife, best friend,..)Anyway, it's 4 years since this game is out, and I played it just now, and it's still a MUST PLAY!

A Paladin's Review: Alan Wake. Thrills and Dark Chills in this Darkness VS Light Story.Genre: Third Person Psychological Horror Thriller Shooter. Developed and Published by: Remedy Entertainment (on PC). Platform: Windows and Xbox 360. Business Model: Base Game.Copy purchased by myself in a Humble Bundle.Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsAlan Wake plays out like a television series or interactive book with six episodes and two special chapters afterwards. A linear story with the writer Alan Wake trying to battle the forces of darkness that have sprung up in a small town while trying to find out what happened to his wife, Alice Wake. If you’re thinking this might be a survival horror game, no, it’s definitely not. AW is more focused on the action and gunplay than it is about surviving things that are trying to scare you to death. It’s a game that works to build up the tension in the player as he/she experiences the weirdness going on. There are some jump scares but I think they rely more on you being tense than trying to break your speakers with a loud noise. In that, Alan Wake is very effective. I often jumped when getting attacked by an enemy to the side and the constant creeping atmosphere keeps you on edge. Especially when they combine that with visuals which make liberal use of shadows and visual warping to distort what you’re seeing as well as limiting the amount of ammunition Alan Wake will be able to find. Nothing is quite so horrifying as running out of bullets and still be surrounded by enemies. I’m not into the horror genre but I do really enjoy thrillers that work to build tension. Alan Wake is one such thriller that’s very memorable and one of my favorites. Story ThoughtsBestselling book author Alan Wake is taking a vacation with his wife to the fictional town of Bright Falls to get away from the pressures at home. Ever since he published his last book, Alan has had a severe writer’s block that’s prevented him from doing any writing for the past couple of years. Subsequently putting a strain on his relationship with his wife, friends and publisher. His hope is that the vacation will help reinvigorate him to write again. But not all is as it seems at Bright Falls. Alice Wake, his wife, disappears. Alan is suspected of foul play. He sets out to figure out what happened to his wife, to discover what darkness is lurking at Bright Falls and fight it. Along the way, Alan realizes just how much of that darkness he’s been carrying inside himself. Of course, he can’t fight it alone so he enlists on his friend Barry who shows up when all the craziness goes down. I don’t feel like spoiling Alan Wake so I’ll just end the explanation of the story here. Suffice it to say though, it’s well paced and keeps a good balance of lightheartedness and dark themes. Light, Darkness and Gunplay MechanicsTo defeat enemies, you simply need to shine enough light on enemies to clear the darkness off of them and then shoot them until they disappear. However, those enemies aren’t simply going to stand around and let you do that. The amount of darkness that surrounds enemies will depend on the type you’re facing. Enemies are shadowy figures that take on a human look, often times looking like firefighters or loggers. While they look human, they aren’t. There’s the usual grunts that will attack you with melee weapons, others that will throw axes at your face and more that have a lot more health or speed. Luckily for the player, none of them have guns. (As the game explains it, it’s because the darkness can’t properly handle complex weapons). There’s a couple of other enemies including birds that swoop on him and environmental objects that get thrown about. There’s also some disturbing boss fights and big arena fights that Alan will need to survive through. For the most part, it’s enough variety to keep the gunplay interesting though I do feel towards the end it starts to lose steam. The AI for enemies is pretty intelligent for the most part. While each enemy isn’t that big of a threat, they will often try to attack from multiple sides and side-step the flashlight being shone in their direction. Worse, most battles take place in cramped quarters with enemies dropping down from all around Alan. This can lead to some rather intense battles throughout the course of the campaign. So, the player needs to keep as much awareness of his surroundings and keep moving as much as possible. PC Port Report and Visuals/AudioAlan Wake is very well optimized and comes with a plethora of PC options that belies its console origins. It comes with all expected resolution options, fullscreen on/off, Vsync on/off and HUD enabled/disabled. Advanced graphics options include: antialiasing up to 8x (which seems to be MSAA) and FXAA off/low/high quality. That seems a little bit odd that FXAA and MSAA could be mixed but they can be. Anisotropic filtering goes to 16x, shadow quality low/med/high, SSAO quality low/high, godray quality off/high, volumetric light quality low/high and finally backdrop quality low/medium/high. You can also adjust the level of detail, draw and grass distance with sliders that don’t quantify what you’re adjusting but at least you have them. There is a field of view slider (in the controls section of the settings menu oddly enough) but it also doesn’t quantify what you’re adjusting. According to PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com], they make recommendations on what your value should be for your particular resolution. Still, there should have been an in-game number to tell you what it did. All of the keyboard keys can be rebound while the controller only offers an alternative control scheme. Finally, there are four separate audio sliders for music, sound effects, speech and cinematic volume. All in all, outside of AW missing some in-game explanations for what everything does, the PC settings menu is very well done. Alan Wake goes for a fairly realistic style that’s heavily punctuated with bright lights and dark shadows. It looks rather good and the setting of Bright Falls feels like a town that definitely could have existed in Washington or Oregon. Their attention to detail and setting sells the Pacific Northwest vibe you can get while exploring. I will mention that there is some awkward/slightly off animations with cars, facial expressions, body movement and other little things. You can notice it but it's not enough to ruin the experience. Final ThoughtsAlan Wake has a great atmosphere, style and combat. The visuals still hold up and the use of shadows, fog and bright lights is very effective. Bright Falls feels like it could have been a real town in the Pacific Northwest. The combat system is really unique and quite enjoyable, even if your enjoyment of it may fall off towards the end of the game. The story is also well paced, constantly upping the ante without getting overwhelming and the characters are well designed and memorable to boot. One of my favorite thriller games I’ve ever played and well worth experiencing.

REVIEW: ALAN WAKE(Main game only: DLC reviews to come separately, later)I’m both an avid reader and a struggling writer. So to find a video game that looks at the perils and pitfalls of writing, albeit ensconced in a horror game, I decided to give it a shot. Ironically enough, I had read a novelization of Alan Wake long before I even got Steam. But how would experiencing the game go?Bright Falls, an isolated town somewhere in Washington State. It seems like the perfect getaway for accomplished writer Alan Wake, who is trying to get away from his increasingly turbulent lifestyle, and have a quiet holiday with his wife Alice at a cabin. But after an argument, Alice disappears, and after trying to save her from a lake, Alan wakes up, to find that a week has passed, a week he has no memory of, and that people are being turned into beings wreathed in darkness, the Taken. What really happened to Alice? What does it have to do with obscure writer Thomas Zane? And is Alan imagining these events, or are they part of a darker plot to turn his writings into reality? With few people to trust, Alan must deal with sceptical authorities and ancient entities in order to save Alice…One thing that I definitely enjoyed in Alan Wake more than anything else was the story. Even after reading the novelization, it felt like I came to it fresh and new. In fact, the TV-like ‘episodic’ format actually helps with the atmosphere, given that Twin Peaks was an influence. Of course, one of the biggest influences (and frequently acknowledged) is that of Stephen King. I’m reminded of Bag of Bones in particular. The atmosphere of the game is not unlike a more action-oriented version of Silent Hill, albeit with not as much psychological unease.Graphics are one of the complaints I do have about the game. Not because they are bad: for the most part, they’re pretty damned good. But on my computer, low frame-rate, especially during some of the more intense combat systems, plagues the game regularly, and I was lucky to be able to defeat some enemies partly because of that frustrating frame rate. This suggests that using standard onboard chips for this game isn’t a good idea, even with the graphics at a low setting. Get a graphics card if you don’t want the frustrating frame-rate. However, the graphics themselves, as I mentioned, are beautiful, my only big complaint being the design and animation of Dr Hartman. For a character who is meant to be a smug and manipulative git, his facial expressions frequently make him look like he’s taken too many happy pills, and whatever threat he has as an antagonist is lessened significantly.Sound-wise, I enjoyed the voice acting fairly well. It does well for what this game is, and the voice processing for the Taken is actually quite eerie and frightening, even if it does sound at times like a Cyberman’s voice from Doctor Who. Music, well, there’s plenty of good pieces, and there’s some interesting selections for the end credits for each episode. But I think the musical sting used whenever a Taken is within attacking range gets old real quick, and that it wouldn’t have hurt to have multiple stings to vary it somewhat.Gameplay-wise, it seems to be the usual bit of action-shooter gameplay that horror games tend to be about nowadays. The combination of using a flashlight to render the Taken vulnerable and then shooting them is a novel one, but does wear a little, though using a flaregun and flashbangs as deadly weapons against the light-fearing creatures is enjoyable. But the camera controls for the mouse are too sensitive, even with the sensitivity turned down. The collectables do make it worthwhile, including reading manuscript pages that add to the backstory of the game, watching short episodes of a Twilight Zone-like TV show, and listening to radio shows that give some background.Overall, Alan Wake is a pretty damn good game, hampered only by its incompatibility with some machines, and a number of other small flaws. Fans of Stephen King, David Lynch, or Silent Hill should give it a whirl.RATING: **** ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a mystery wrapped inside an enigma. Nothing else. If you try to make sense of all this, then you are certainly a brave one.The story, really well written I must say, is heavily inspired by Stephen King, H.P. Lovecraft and such. It does not have the crude horror of Stephen King, but it has the darkness. It does not have the overworldly presence of the Lovecraftian stories, but it has the unexplainable, the evil. Story driven to the core, Alan Wake will make you think twice before going in the dark (even if there isn't a single moment of true horror in my opinion). It's not about the horror really, it's about the darkness. You need to find out what lies in this darkness, what can be found and what should not be found. Will you be able to kill what you can't see?Alan Wake is a serious 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your looking for an in depth, dark and solid story, you won't be disapointed.This game offers many twists and dramas, great story line and not to mention the good voice acting and dialouge.It has intense third-person gameplay and puts you in tough situations where you have to question how good your shooting skills are . In the story you are handed a flashlight which you use to burn the dark shield of your eniemes so you can kill them..... sounds complicated right? but its easy and lots of fun to kill your eniemes using the power of the lights.There is lots of secrets and collectibles around the games levels to keep you occupied. To narrow it down, it is an outright classic of a game and sets a good reputation to the third-person genre.

												Well, it's a good game with unique story line. Also, gameplay similar to Resident Evil and Silent Hill but no scary moment and have a few jump scare.In this game you are the writer and on a way to vacation but then Alan's wife got kindnapped so Alan need to save her. Everything that Alan wrote in novel is become true.Environment is very beautiful, details are pretty good, can make really high FPS and smooth gameplay.Light is your best friend, you can't hurt enemy while they're covered in the dark. You need to expose them first. Very unique ways to play.Bad thing is sometime lack of ammo, lack of enemy types, gameplay might feel repeatative because you always walk in the dark wood, boss fight too easy and not so creative and the worst, Motion blur might get you headege.This game is pretty under the radar, it's a very good game but not well known.At least try it :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tremendous atmosphere, a wonky, nonsense story and tedious, repetitive combat combine for a decent experience that could have been so much better. My biggest problem with the game was how linear it is, you basically push the stick forward to trigger the next cut scene/enemy encounter. There is no puzzle solving and there is never two ways to go about a task, you are very much on rails the entire time. But the atmosphere and characters did grow on me even if the story didn't, so it wasn't much of a chore to push through to the end. Were there a ""thumbs middle"" option rather than just up or down, that's what I'd be giving this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stephen King once wrote that “Nightmares exist outside of logic, and there’s little fun to be had in explanations; they’re antithetical to the poetry of fear.” In a horror story, the victim keeps asking ""Why?"" But there can be no explanation, and there shouldn’t be one. The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest, and it’s what we’ll remember in the end. My name is Alan Wake. I’m a writer.

												If you love kinds of mystery, you should find this interesting.I will be spoiler free as much as I can.::: Story :::The story is a bit hard to get a hang of, I was confused until I was in the middle of the story, where everything started to reveal themselves. Nice story with twists here and there, and keep me wanting to see more till the end. However, I personally think that it shouldn't end where it is, just a little bit further would be nice !::: Visual and FX :::The game looks nice indeed, you can play as vanilla or enhance it with tool of your choice, sweetfx for example. One thing to look for is that the game use a lot of light FX, i mean, tons of them. (as the game concept is based around the light and the dark) If you have problem with dynamic lighting fx, feeling dizzy from looking at them, you might not enjoy the game much.::: Gameplay :::The overall gameplay is okay, the unique combat system, light the darkness then blow it away, is fresh enough to be enjoyable. however, I was expecting that it would be more of the adventure, but instead, it is more action-oriented game. I don't mean that it is bad, but the game will throw enemies at you along your journey to the level that it losts its charm as mystery-themed game.Most encounters give you choices, to fight or to run. You can blast everything in your path with whatever at your disposal (tools, weapons, or even world's interactive objects), or avoid the encounter (if it isn't forced you to fight in the story), you can perform a timed-dodge, or even knock enemies off balance to get away from harms. The game utilized checkpoint system, when you reach it, the pursuers will be disappeared, and believe me, you will strive to get to it than stay and fight (especially in nightmare difficulty on your 2nd playthrough).Encounters are well-designed, though they lack of visual variations (you will see them again and again). Almost all of them can be staggered, which will give you some breathing room for whatever reason. They will surprise you from time to time (on your first playthrough).Your first playthrough will be a good experience, but on your 2nd or 3rd one on Nightmare difficulty, which you will be forced to play if you are intended to 100% the game, will become quite a task to finish, if you are the go-loud type. The achievements can be annoying (collect 100 of easily missed bottles), refering to the guide can help, a lot. It is fortunate that the game is in episodes, and can be replayed later.The control is responsive and is good enough to allow you to face multiple enemies at once without too much troubles, although sometimes it is too fast XD.::: Overall :::The game is good. The designs match the concepts, however, they seems to think that more actions are better for this kind of games, but really, they are too much. It play nicely from the beginning to the end. I recommend this for a single playthough, as it lacks of dynamic elements, making the game predictable. 2nd or 3rd playthough will be more like archievement runs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With the detailed world and well written plot, it's easy to lose yourself in the story (I played it until 2am not noticing the time).To anyone reading this, just buy the game.

												A richly detailed environment, in lightness and darkness, bring this game very much to life. Atmospheric surroundings and sound effects, embellished by excellent cut-scenes that help the narrative as the story unfolds.The plot is fantastic yet grounded at the same time, riddled with clever what-ifs and many-layered implications of what it means to write creatively and what it is to truly push the boundaries between imagination and reality in this process. The gameplay itself is pretty damn epic as well. Action remains fast-paced and challenging without being too frustrating, supplies such as ammo or batteries are plentiful enough to stop you ever running the risk of being completely defenceless while remaining sparse enough to keep you considering what to preserve and when, and there is a varying degree of weaponry and enemy strength and speed to keep it interesting.One thing I really like about this game is that the game never gives you too much ammo, so you never really have that safe feeling when you are trudging through the woods. In other games you usually stack up on a lot of guns and ammo and end up being a one man army - not so in Alan Wake. Here, your character really is a frail writer with a flashlight and a tweed jacket, not a super soldier - your most powerful weapon is also the light. Without light, even the most potent gun cannot so much as even scratch the enemy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 This is one of the most atmospheric and interesting survival horror games I've played. It features a really nice fractured narrative, and the torchlight game mechanic works very well indeed. There's a couple of jump scares in there, but for the most part it relies on a deeply unsettling atmosphere to pull you in. And it works well. Graphically the game looks beautiful, even though it's getting on a bit now, and the episodic format allows you to pace your play. Each episode takes around two hors to complete, and there's six episodes (plus two more via DLC). The sound works well, the musical score is superb, and it features a number of great songs by Poets of the Fall, as well as various other artists new and old. I really can't recommend this game enough. Go and buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												America, the land where ammo and energizer batteries are literally just lying about all over the wilderness.I really disliked this game at the start, it just felt dumbed down, run down a linear path and shine a light on stuff. But actually persevering with it, the game becomes pretty good.The only real problem with the game that I still find, is that it's billed as a horror game, except it isn't remotely scary at all.The graphics and ""spooky effects"" look really nice, and the whilst the combat is pretty basic, it gets more challenging as the game goes on, and they include a few other interesting obstacles, especially the haunted objects.The plot gets better as you go along too, as more characters are introduced such as the FBI agent and your own writing agent.All in all the game suffers from a slow start, that in retrospect you can see they've tried hard to make it an easy learning curve, and spoonfeed too much, but once it gets going, it's pretty fun and interesting to play.

												One of my favorite games of all time.  I love the atmosphere and storytelling.  Whole the gameplay is solid, I think this game really shines when played at night with the lights off.  The game is not overly scary, but is a dramatic storytelling of a man's fight against ""the darkness.""  I don't know, I'm not good with words.  It's good, play it damnit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played this a few years ago on the Xbox 360 and now got around to playing it on the PC. Overall I feel this game has a great story and I love the whole atmosphere to it and it is well worth experiencing.The combat is interesting but my only complaint is it doesn't really change much throughout the game or have much diversity to it. Same with the enemies faced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stephen King once wrote that “Nightmares exist outside of logic, and there’s little fun to be had in explanations; they’re antithetical to the poetry of fear.” In a horror story, the victim keeps asking ""Why?"" But there can be no explanation, and there shouldn’t be one. The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest, and it’s what we’ll remember in the end. My name is Alan Wake. I’m a writer.

												Simply one of the best horror/survival/action/adventure games I've played since Silent Hill 2.  You play the role of Alan Wake, an author on a vacation with his wife to unwind in a small lakeside town.  What follows is a rollercoaster ride of confusion, realization, depression, and redemption.+Beautiful and surreal loactions that breath new life into what shouldn't be.+Simple yet challenging combat with a unique set of weaponry.+Other characters that draw you into the world; sometimes making you laugh out loud and sometimes jump out of your seat.+Two additional episodes to complete after the game that tie the story up nicely.

YouTube™ Video: IDGSL #1 - Alan Wake 

			Views: 16		

			The first episode of my game review serie. Be indulgent, it's the first game review I ever record. it's bounded to be flawed.		

~ I'D GIVE SOMETHING LIKE... ~~ #1 - Alan Wake ~=STORY=Alan Wake is the story of a despicable popular writter who wants to take a break from the celebrity of being a writter.It is as hipster and cringe worthy as it sounds.In love with a dumb*** woman who's scared of the dark, Alan has to take care of her everytime a fu**ing light turns off somewhere.And also every nights, for obvious reasons.Lights shutting down in the evening is enough to make her :jarate: herself.Every day must be a stressful event where she's more anxious the more the time goes.Blinking and closing her eyes must be a constant ~Nightmare~.Getting to the end of episode one, I realised that this game was made to be similar to a TV show, just like many episodic games such as TWD.The thing is, the story in the former is absolutely ret-/-/- while the one in the later is actually good.The story tries to go for this dark and grim tone, like a psychological thriller with some kind of deep and complexe paradox... but every dialogues are a reminder of how absurd the story and characters are.IDGSL : 3/10=GAMEPLAY=The idea behind the gameplay mechanics is interesting, casting light with your flashlight to break some kind of darkness shield and shoot the enemies when unvulnerable.The fact that it's pushed aside for a dumb TV-like story is pretty sad. But I'm not over yet.The game was obviously made for consoles with auto-aiming in mind. If you're looking for any kind of real skill requirement, this isn't the game for you.Without auto-aim, the game would be a chore, pretty much like Resident Evil 4 actually is.My despise for the Over-The-Shoulder view is beyond and above and every game using this broken third-person view confirms my hatred towards it.Even though the auto-aim makes shooting somewhat fun, the fact that you need to break the darkness shield of other enemies makes it a hassle.You will often shoot at an enemy that is not unvulnerable, wasting ammo in the process.The enemies are fast and taking the time to reload after wasting ammos will often get you hit and most probably killedFortunatly, batteries for the flashlight and ammos are abundent in game and you will respawn to the closest checkpoint when you die, which makes the game feel easy, even if you die. Playing the game at an harder difficulty obviously won't fix these things that are simply balanced to be unbalanced. Less Ammo, Less HP and staring from further awaydoesn't make a game more enjoyable.It just makes it more annoying and frustrating to play.IDGSL : 4/10=GRAPHICS=The graphics are alright, the shadings and lightnings are a wonder but the facial expressions of the main character are just laughable sometimes (at times).The animations aren't the best we've ever seen, it's working from far away but the closer you get, the more you see the uncanny valley of their expressions.Shading & light : 9/10Character design : 9/10Animations : 5/10IDGSL : 6/10=SOUNDTRACK=While not memorable, the soundtrack fits well with the story-telling in overall. It isn't annoying, it isn't pleasing, it's just bland and neutral.The music played at the end of the first episode is absolutely ridicoulus for the dark and grimy theme the game and story is aiming at. This wasn't good at all.The sound effects are alright, nothing special, it get's the job done. I've got nothing more to say about them other than that the revolver's sound feels great.IDGSL : 5/10=LAST NOTE=As the timer goes up, I'm actually writting this review instead of playing the game.And it's the second time I'm trying to get into it. I think it says a lot about my feeling toward it.I really liked the dark aspects of the game but the clunkyness of the gameplay, the awful story and the annoying protagonist and his wife makes me wonder if I really want to go further than the first episode.As a TOTAL, IDGSL : 35/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is an interesting 3rd person action game featuring intense-yet-flawed gameplay, thankfully held up by the gripping, 'Twin Peaks' style plot.In an unusual choice of protagonist, you play as an author suffering from writer's block. You're taken on a holiday by your ever-supportive wife, but things start to go a bit wonky. Before you know it, the whole place is falling apart, your wife has been eaten by a lake, and you keep finding pages from a novel you don't remember writing. Between the episodic nature, and the overall presentation, this is a game that feels like it wishes it was a TV show.In terms of gameplay, Alan Wake is a solid 3rd-person action game, but it's let down by a lack of variety across the board. There are scarcely half a dozen different types of enemies, and five weapons (two of which are shotguns), of which only two can be held simultaneously (although the pistol can never be replaced, leaving the player with very limited choice).The gameplay revolves around the concept of having to burn away the 'darkness' around an enemy with a flashlight, much like armour, before you can harm them with physical weaponry. This is an excellent concept in itself, but by the end of the game it feels extremely worn. With every enemy you encounter, you'll have to follow the same routine: get far enough away to burn them with the light, then put them down with a handful of bullets. I cannot think of a single exception to this from start to finish, even including prominent antagonists.Aside from being extremely repetitive, the game suffers from the play-style enforced by this mechanic. In a game which wants you to feel panicked while you run for your life, you're constantly forced to stop and stand still while you tediously point your flashlight at yet another enemy. And yes - by and large, this is the only possible tactic.You might think that running away would be a good choice, especially given the thriller/horror tone of the game, but you have an extremely limited running ability, and the enemies run faster than you. Making a desperate break away from a group of enemies turns into an exercise in frustration as Wake puffs and pants like an asthmatic, before being set upon, exhausted, by the same group of enemies you were trying to run away from in the first place.Alan Wake's saving grace is the plot and the atmosphere it generates. I expected nothing less from the studio which created Max Payne (and there are a handful of knowing winks to Payne within this game), and Remedy really knocked it out of the park here. I was genuinely gripped by the story, which is split into six 'episodes' in the style of a TV show. The daytime segments, where you are given more free reign to explore the environment, are particularly excellent.If you enjoy being sucked into a game's world, Alan Wake will not disappoint, provided you can slog through the gameplay to reach the next bit of story. The only real let-down here is the lip-syncing on the character models, which is laughably poor for a game of this time.Part-way into the game, you're given perhaps the greatest spectacle that Alan Wake has to offer - the signal flare. It's hardly surprising, given that this is a game focused so intently on light/dark contrast, but the flares look absolutely stunning. Having obtained them, the most effective tactic when encountering a group of enemies becomes to hunker down.Pick away the shields of the strongest enemies first, waiting for the group as a whole to get close enough. Once they're within arms reach, pop a flare and watch as the screen erupts into ruby red pyrotechnics. Even with the repetitive nature of the overall game, I never got tired of the almost messianic sound and visuals of the flare - Alan Wake's true saviour (aside from the plot).The game also has a number of driving sections, which provide a generally enjoyable change of pace. At worst, they were short enough to not cause any problems. At best, they reminded me of racing over the sand in Half-Life 2. The number of replacement cars scattered throughout the levels does, however, make me wonder if there's a chronic problem with people abandoning perfectly good cars by the roadside in America's north-west...So, as a game, Alan Wake is mediocre at best. If you're looking for a horror game full of scares, or solid 3rd person action, this is not the game for you. But would I otherwise recommend it? Absolutely. For me, it all comes down to the plot, and how easily I can become absorbed in a game's environment and characters. Remedy did a great job on that.The real problem with Alan Wake is that it really feels like Remedy wanted to make a TV show, and accidentally made a game. Given that their upcoming game, Quantum Break, is reported to have an accompanying TV show, I can only hope they get the balance right the next time around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found Alan Wake to be a very enjoyable dip into the world of horror. The atmospheres of the game are dark and beautiful and the story is something we can relate to - an unknown horror tormenting us from the dark. The gameplay, while repititious, is enjoyable and downright challenging on Nightmare difficulty.One thing I wish they had done better was more exploration. There is usually very little reason to move off of the set path for more than a short time. There was real potential for side-tracking.Overall a very enjoyable third person shooting, story driven experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is all about the atmosphere.You will no doubt get spooked out while playing it.The storyline is amazing and it is delivered like it is a TV Show.I like the fact that after each chapter they rewind the most important things that happened.This makes it easier for people who do not finish a game in a few days since you do not lose track of the storyline.Gameplay wise it is fun even if you will end up using only 1-2 weapons and fight like the same set of enemies for the most part of the game.The boss battles are very well made,what I mean by this is that they made them challenging,fun and different from the oveall game.The mechanics of the game are what makes this unique.I would recommend this to anyone because this is not your everyday third person shooter,it is a unique game and you need to play it to understand it.Horror atmosphere? : Yes!Fun game mechanics? : Yes!Interesting and intriguing storyline? : Yes!Worth playing? : Definitely Yes!

												Alan Wake, is a singleplayer mystery, psychological thriller, that comes very close to the stories Stephen King writes, Alan Wake even mentions him in the game. The story is great, narative is good. Some charakter animations just look crap even for a 2 year old game. The combat with a combination of your flashlight, flares and guns, against the ""taken"" feels satisfying, but gets repetitive after about 60% completion the game (for me that is). The world itself keeps it from getting boring all together. At the end i recommend this game for sure! The story and a atmosphere kept me going, wanted to know what happens next. Great game.

												On my second play through of this gem of a game! I remember waiting for it while it was being developed. It was promised for PC and even showcased on it showing off the latest DX bells and whisles. Then all of a sudden the enemy of PC gaming Microsoft pulled the plug and the Windows version was no more. It became an Xbox exclusive and the sales were poor. I felt they deserved the poor sales after what they did to the PC community and basically forgot about the game after that. A few years later out of the blue I see ""Alan Wale"" available on Steam and can't believe it! I then find out ""Remedy"" the awesome developers that brought us Max Payne 1 and 2 funded the port themselves and I was psyched! To top it all off the price was only $30.00 and came with all the game's DLC included. I bought the game and got completely absorbed in it. Not only was it a fantastic game but the port was perfect and the graphics looked so much better than the Xbox version I felt they really did us justice. I remember reading later that week that they made their money back on the PC port in 2 days time! That made me very happy, they were rewarded for taking their time to bring this remarkable title to us PC gamers after all. Since then there have been many sales, I've seen the game go as low as $3.00 and gifted it to many friends and family who never played it before. Everyone ended up loving it and not too long after that we got the expansion pack ""American Nghtmare"" which was also a treat. The point of this review is not just to recommend this game because it's a great AAA title, it's because it proved there still is a thriving PC community out there that will take care of the developers that take care of us. I hope in the end Remedy ended up making a lot of money off the PC port, hopefully moreso than they did on the Xbox exclusive. I know they showed their gratitude to us by the statements they made and that alone proved to me Remedy is a class act.I look forward to their next title and hopefully they learned their lesson and realize there is a strong PC community out here ready to support them so therefore when the next game is released give us the PC version along with the consoles! I expect great future titles from Remedy and the PC gamer's support we deserve.So if you haven't played this game BUY IT... SALE OR NOT, it's worth whatever you end up paying for it and grab ""American Nightmare"" as well since Remedy has stated we won't be seeing a sequel to Alan Wake anytime soon... if ever. It would be a shame for any third person shooter fan to miss out on this excellent franchise!! ENJOY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Indeed an extremely great game ! It is made in a way that i have never seen before, the way it plays each chapter like it was an episode from a television serie, the way the gameplay is all about light and dark, i think this is by far one of the best action survival horror games i have played, and not horror because the things you see are nasty, but because it creates the perfect scenario for a horror movie/game, the fact that it happens mostly at night and in the dark, the various scenarios you see throughout all the chapters, the exploration although limited, makes it seem less linear wanting you to check every corner for ammo and batteries if you need'em, and the story... The story is by far the best minblown i have heard, tons of plot twists, and very but very well written, leaving an ending that not all can understand unless they pay full atention to the game.For the story, the way it's written, the actions that happen, this game deserves 10/10For the gameplay, it's pretty nice, but sometimes easy, way too easy if you ever played survival horror games, so it would be 8/10For the replayability, well this game made it's mark, because if you want to get all the pages that complete the story, you gotta complete this game on Nightmare difficulty (equivalent to hard in a easy normal hard scale) because they only appear in that game mode, so yeah at least 2 playthroughs to complete it with 20h for me to do the first one, 9/10Scenario, just beautiful, though you spend most of the time at night there are still day levels (until it gets dark) and you don't have one chapter in the same area as another, and the sights are worth seeing. 9/10Summing it up, PLAY THE GAME, Alan Wake is an amazing game in it's own way, for fans of survival action games, give it a try and you'll enjoy for sure :) 9,5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake id undoubtedly a triple-A game and there's no questioning in it being a GOOD GAME. After playing for several hours and not completing it, there's one thing I need to point out: the. story. is. killer.In all due seriousness, however, Alan Wake is a writer to have found himself in a messy situation when Mr. Wake and his wife just wanted to go relaxing outside of the city. His wife goes missing and he needs to figure stuff out. It all gets way more complicated than that, and it makes you scratch your head at times. Overall, the story makes you feel; that's what makes a good story! And the environment certainly adds to it. Whoever designed the levels need to be glorified. They did a stellar work designing/creating levels that makes you fear the night (literally fear it) and adore the day. During the daytime, you're found in a 1960-style small town that really makes you just want to grab a chair, sit down and relax. It's so calm and beautiful. But then comes the night, and Alan needs to fight for his life and so do you.Speaking of fighting for his life, you get extraordinarily limited attempting to do that very task. There's a ridiculous limit on the ammunition you can carry (despite ammunition being found everywhere, it does run out quickly) that makes it incredibly difficult to get out of a hairy situation. For example, if you get stuck and there's no ammo around & you meet a ton of enemies, well, tough luck.. your best bet is to run away from them.. in other words, no combat action. CHEAP AND UNACCEPTABLE ♥♥♥♥ING ""SOLUTION"". But, usually you do have ammo if you use your equipment very conservatively.. no fun doing that, however.Story is fantastic, gameplay is great and the environment & the atmosphere are out of this world.. astonishing, really! And the game is so well done that it's essentially bug-free! Awesome! If there's a game that gives you a great bang for the buck, Alan Wake is certainly on that list. I thoroughly enjoy this.9,0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I know they showed their gratitude to us by the statements they made and that alone proved to me Remedy is a class act.I look forward to their next title and hopefully they learned their lesson and realize there is a strong PC community out here ready to support them so therefore when the next game is released give us the PC version along with the consoles! I expect great future titles from Remedy and the PC gamer's support we deserve.So if you haven't played this game BUY IT... SALE OR NOT, it's worth whatever you end up paying for it and grab ""American Nightmare"" as well since Remedy has stated we won't be seeing a sequel to Alan Wake anytime soon... if ever. It would be a shame for any third person shooter fan to miss out on this excellent franchise!! ENJOY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Indeed an extremely great game ! It is made in a way that i have never seen before, the way it plays each chapter like it was an episode from a television serie, the way the gameplay is all about light and dark, i think this is by far one of the best action survival horror games i have played, and not horror because the things you see are nasty, but because it creates the perfect scenario for a horror movie/game, the fact that it happens mostly at night and in the dark, the various scenarios you see throughout all the chapters, the exploration although limited, makes it seem less linear wanting you to check every corner for ammo and batteries if you need'em, and the story... The story is by far the best minblown i have heard, tons of plot twists, and very but very well written, leaving an ending that not all can understand unless they pay full atention to the game.For the story, the way it's written, the actions that happen, this game deserves 10/10For the gameplay, it's pretty nice, but sometimes easy, way too easy if you ever played survival horror games, so it would be 8/10For the replayability, well this game made it's mark, because if you want to get all the pages that complete the story, you gotta complete this game on Nightmare difficulty (equivalent to hard in a easy normal hard scale) because they only appear in that game mode, so yeah at least 2 playthroughs to complete it with 20h for me to do the first one, 9/10Scenario, just beautiful, though you spend most of the time at night there are still day levels (until it gets dark) and you don't have one chapter in the same area as another, and the sights are worth seeing. 9/10Summing it up, PLAY THE GAME, Alan Wake is an amazing game in it's own way, for fans of survival action games, give it a try and you'll enjoy for sure :) 9,5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is an interesting 3rd person action game featuring intense-yet-flawed gameplay, thankfully held up by the gripping, 'Twin Peaks' style plot.In an unusual choice of protagonist, you play as an author suffering from writer's block. You're taken on a holiday by your ever-supportive wife, but things start to go a bit wonky. Before you know it, the whole place is falling apart, your wife has been eaten by a lake, and you keep finding pages from a novel you don't remember writing. Between the episodic nature, and the overall presentation, this is a game that feels like it wishes it was a TV show.In terms of gameplay, Alan Wake is a solid 3rd-person action game, but it's let down by a lack of variety across the board. There are scarcely half a dozen different types of enemies, and five weapons (two of which are shotguns), of which only two can be held simultaneously (although the pistol can never be replaced, leaving the player with very limited choice).The gameplay revolves around the concept of having to burn away the 'darkness' around an enemy with a flashlight, much like armour, before you can harm them with physical weaponry. This is an excellent concept in itself, but by the end of the game it feels extremely worn. With every enemy you encounter, you'll have to follow the same routine: get far enough away to burn them with the light, then put them down with a handful of bullets. I cannot think of a single exception to this from start to finish, even including prominent antagonists.Aside from being extremely repetitive, the game suffers from the play-style enforced by this mechanic. In a game which wants you to feel panicked while you run for your life, you're constantly forced to stop and stand still while you tediously point your flashlight at yet another enemy. And yes - by and large, this is the only possible tactic.You might think that running away would be a good choice, especially given the thriller/horror tone of the game, but you have an extremely limited running ability, and the enemies run faster than you. Making a desperate break away from a group of enemies turns into an exercise in frustration as Wake puffs and pants like an asthmatic, before being set upon, exhausted, by the same group of enemies you were trying to run away from in the first place.Alan Wake's saving grace is the plot and the atmosphere it generates. I expected nothing less from the studio which created Max Payne (and there are a handful of knowing winks to Payne within this game), and Remedy really knocked it out of the park here. I was genuinely gripped by the story, which is split into six 'episodes' in the style of a TV show. The daytime segments, where you are given more free reign to explore the environment, are particularly excellent.If you enjoy being sucked into a game's world, Alan Wake will not disappoint, provided you can slog through the gameplay to reach the next bit of story. The only real let-down here is the lip-syncing on the character models, which is laughably poor for a game of this time.Part-way into the game, you're given perhaps the greatest spectacle that Alan Wake has to offer - the signal flare. It's hardly surprising, given that this is a game focused so intently on light/dark contrast, but the flares look absolutely stunning. Having obtained them, the most effective tactic when encountering a group of enemies becomes to hunker down.Pick away the shields of the strongest enemies first, waiting for the group as a whole to get close enough. Once they're within arms reach, pop a flare and watch as the screen erupts into ruby red pyrotechnics. Even with the repetitive nature of the overall game, I never got tired of the almost messianic sound and visuals of the flare - Alan Wake's true saviour (aside from the plot).The game also has a number of driving sections, which provide a generally enjoyable change of pace. At worst, they were short enough to not cause any problems. At best, they reminded me of racing over the sand in Half-Life 2. The number of replacement cars scattered throughout the levels does, however, make me wonder if there's a chronic problem with people abandoning perfectly good cars by the roadside in America's north-west...So, as a game, Alan Wake is mediocre at best. If you're looking for a horror game full of scares, or solid 3rd person action, this is not the game for you. But would I otherwise recommend it? Absolutely. For me, it all comes down to the plot, and how easily I can become absorbed in a game's environment and characters. Remedy did a great job on that.The real problem with Alan Wake is that it really feels like Remedy wanted to make a TV show, and accidentally made a game. Given that their upcoming game, Quantum Break, is reported to have an accompanying TV show, I can only hope they get the balance right the next time around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found Alan Wake to be a very enjoyable dip into the world of horror. The atmospheres of the game are dark and beautiful and the story is something we can relate to - an unknown horror tormenting us from the dark. The gameplay, while repititious, is enjoyable and downright challenging on Nightmare difficulty.One thing I wish they had done better was more exploration. There is usually very little reason to move off of the set path for more than a short time. There was real potential for side-tracking.Overall a very enjoyable third person shooting, story driven experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a devoted PC gamer (and I mean PC ONLY...no console in this house), I was concerned that this console port might not be up to snuff.  I was also concerned about the third-person perspective, as I am traditionally an FPS gamer.  My concerns were unfounded...this game is truly great!!!  What really makes it an excellent game is the depth of the storyline; it's very intriguing and at the same time isn't too tedious.  Also, the method in which the story is told (in ""episodes"" like a TV show) is really fresh and exciting.  Two thumbs up!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Short version: 86%Alan Wake is masterfully written mystery horror thriller with great narrative, excellent level design, memorable supporting characters and a combat system that starts out excellent but turns into a chore near the end. If you love a good mystery story and don’t mind that it uses the age-old light versus dark theme, then Alan Wake is certainly a game you should play.Long version:Alan Wake is a little bit like playing a video game version of Stephen King’s early novels; after all it’s a supernatural psychological mystery thriller set in a small US town in the middle of nowhere. (Though instead of Maine it’s situated in a heavily forested area somewhere in the state of Washington.) Therefore the main focus of the game is on the story and the narrative, which complement each other in such levels that is very rarely seen in a video game.As a game, Alan Wake is a mixture of survival horror (the Alone in the Dark kind, not the Resident Evil type) and third-person shooter. The early parts of the game focus mainly on the mystery and the narrative, all enemies are only there to keep up the suspense. Sadly it eventually turns into straight-up arena combat against waves and waves of enemies. And the combat mechanic is really working against these scenarios, turning the last part of the game into a series of trial-and-error fights.The game also has way too many collectibles– almost four hundred, counting the ones in the DLCs– and only two type of them serve any real purpose: the hidden chests, which give you some additional gear; and the manuscript pages, that will eventually tell the story of Alan’s missing week, and shed some more light on the mystery.If you can get past of the combat system, that turns the game into a nightmare in late levels, and focus on the story only, Alan Wake will be one of the best thrillers you have ever played, on par with the most well-known movies in that genre. Good enough to play it more than one time, which is a rare thing on story-focused mystery games. Just don’t try and get all achievements, unless you have a very large amount of patience…			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game could have been interesting if it weren't for the lousy gameplay. After twenty minutes I was ready to uninstall but I hoped it would get more interesting... It did, sort of... The cutscenes are interesting and the whole atmosphere of the game is like an x-files/twilight zone/slasher movie. It is gripping to get to know what's going on. However to get tot the next cutscene you have to play the corridor based game where you have to shine a light on the enemy to weaken then before you can shoot them, or (and this even becomes necessary later on) you have to run away to the next light. That't the gameplay, no literally... that's it unless you count picking up thermoses (what for) and manuscripts. Running away is so critical yet the makers crippled the running so that your character is exhausted after about 5 meters. Uninstalled and will be trying to find the cutscenes on youtube.

												I must give this game a negative review seeing that there's almost no one else who whould do that.First of all, Alan Wake is not a bad game. In fact it has quite good atmosphere even though it can't compare the some other ""atmospheric"" games (hello SOMA).However, there's one thing that makes the game bad in my view. It's terribly repetitive. Yes, most games that are longer than few hours get repetitive, but this game FEELS repetitive. You are fighting the same enemies again and again, which wouldn't really matter if it was fun, but it's increadibly boring and lengthy processes. The environment feelt quite dull, too. There are actually quite a few diverse environments, but somehow after finishing the game I feel like I spent most of the time walking in the forrest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Immersive atmosphere with good story and interesting characters, in the end this game is an homage to some shows of the 90´s like Twin Peaks or even X-Files. My only complaint is that the level design in the main game is a little bit repetitive as the gameplay, but if you play the special episodes you can see a more dynamic level design.

												Ever since I played Shade which wasn't a big of a game, I've wanted that kinda horror survival story based game that brings ""something new to the table""; and let me begin by saying that Alan Wake brings that ""something new to the table"".The physics of the game is flawless and since this game was also developed for the console, the developers made sure that the game looked beautiful even though with limited resources, bring all that artisanship into the PC world and you end up with beautifully rendered scenes and levels.However If you dwelve into the story you will find that some chapters and missions were unnecessarily put in the game to lengthen the gameplay and so it did, but the unnecessary bits arent too boring to feel out of place, the game's chapter based progression gets you all psyched up and ignore the minor boringness that creeps in midway through the storyline. The game's levels are designed to motivate the players complete each chapter rather than solving the whole mystery which is more or less accomplished at the end of the game.I wont go into the details of the story and create a spoiler for you guys but all I will say however, is that both Alan Wake and it's DLC leaves many questions unanswered and a gaping room for a Sequel and I will definitely buy that sequel.My rating 4.1/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Довольно сильный триллер. Alan Wake хватает и не отпускает до последних минут сюжета, все было бы идеально, но подвел геймплей. Геймплей который наскучивает в первые часы после прохождения, но вы продолжаете терпеть ради новой сюжетной вставки. Игра имеет очень не однозначную концовку, которую кто-то примет за отличный эндинг истории, кто-то за ужасный, но равнодушным не останется никто. Советую брать только самым выносливым и интересующимся жанром в общем. Игра имеет множество интересных идей в плане сторитейлинга (например, рукописи сюжета, которые герой находит в ходе прохождения). Она точно достойна вашего внимания.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a game where you play as Stephen King's arch-nemesis Alan Wake. The game takes place in Alan's subconscious while he suffers from a coma which he got by attempting to stage an imitation-injury involving paying a man to run-over him in a semi-automatic truck. Alan imagines he is in the world of Twin Peaks but gets attacked by the shadows of Stephen King during nightfall, which serves as an interruption to his trolling of Stephen King message boards and fan-sites. To my surprise, Alan Wake is actually a multiplayer deathmatch shooter which licenses the technology pioneered by the America's Army games wherein every player plays as Alan Wake, but appears as Stephen King to other players. After playing through each of the multiplayer scenarios a cut-scene plays which reveals that Alan was shooting innocent people in the world world in his comatose state, and trolling actual Stephen King message boards. For this surprise twist, I can easily recommend Alan Wake to all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is frustrating and dull. It's incredably story-heavy, so you owe it to yourself to look up the story before buying the game. I'm not kidding. A big reason why I can't finish this game is the annoying story. The cheesy story in American Nightmare is far more enjoyable, and I recommned that game over this one. The gameplay in Alan Wake would be okay, if the dodge button weren't mapped to the sprint button. In gears of war, the same-button setup wasn't a problem for me. In Alan Wake, it tends to get me killed. The gunplay is ruined by the light mechanic and lack of interesting guns. You can't hurt enemies until you've blasted off thier ""armor"" with your flashlight or a gernade, and you spend alot of the first part of the game with the same pistol and maybe a rifle or shotgun. Encounters devlove into repetitious affairs where a bunch of crazy guys charge out of nowhere and ramble at you until you've killed them or they've thrown enough spiky-things at you to kill you. Not alot of enemy variation, either.Alan Wake would probably make a better book or movie than a game. Go watch a let's play or something, you might have more fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Spoiler Free Review:I had high hopes going into Alan Wake, it being recommended after completing the Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and now that I’ve finished my first run through I’m a bit disappointed.In Alan Wake you play as Alan, a writer confronting a “darkness” with your trusty flashlight to guide the way.  It’s an episodic/narrative type game, not to be confused with Telltale games where you barely get to move around – in Alan Wake you do have combat, driving, and most things you’d expect from a normal video game.My first run through of the story, including the two DLC episodes only took 11 hours.  Each of the main 6 episodes take about 1.5 hours to complete.  While other reviewers are praising the story, I just couldn’t get into it.  The writing and voice acting were excellent, and there were some very good parts, however the story never drew me in, mainly due to Alan Wake’s many faults and the general premise of a writer or artists impact on the supernatural.To the main drawback - the gameplay itself was frustrating.  The camera view alone, being force on a “over the shoulder” experience didn’t fit with the play style.  Sprint in the game became a joke, forced into a perpetual reminder of how they could have done soooo much better.  If you sprint for too long (5 seconds?) you basically stop in your tracks to catch your breath – terrible for escaping enemies.  The main drawback is the gameplay is extremely repetitive.  Walk, trigger a scene, use flashlight to stop darkness, shoot, and repeat.  It’s the same cycle throughout the entire game.  When a boss fight, or a major skirmish does happen, they all unfold in predictably the same ways, with the same waves of enemies, which you combat in exactly the same method.As mentioned before, the DLC consists of two episodes which continues the main storyline, but not in any meaningful way, and there is no multiplayer which is a good thing.  Graphically the game is fine, in line with the times, but nothing spectacular.  The graphical rendering between gameplay and cut scenes is obvious and they could have done a better job smoothing it out or rendering the cut scenes with actual gameplay.With the lack of a gripping story, and lack luster and frustrating mechanics, finally nailed by the repetitiveness, this isn’t going to be a recommendation.  However, just like with books there are some good and some bad, but either way when you’re reading it you enjoy it slightly…. that is kind of how this was.  I still had fun playing it, just didn’t leave a good aftertaste.Rating: 4 out of 10. Just can’t recommend it.Playing on i7-6700, 16Gb RAM, GTX1070 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6.5\10Update 1: Score updated. It seems like woods area is poorly balanced. Game recovers itself from a disaster very fast after you get an advanced weapons like flares and flashbangs. Combat is intense but doable again and sometimes even enjoyable. It's hard to screw up and die now so combat doesn't break immersion anymore.First thoughts: Its amazes me how this game is faulty by design.At the begining game feels great, combat is intence, but doable, and you have just enough ammo and resources to make progress. Graphics are good too. I was really interested to finish the game.But later in the game(that's only a second chapter): * You will be spammed by respawning hordes of enemies.* You will have to save your ammo, but you really can't do that because of tougher enemies and respawning 3-4 at a time. Ordinary enemy takes 3 shots before he goes down, and tougher ones takes much more. Since you can't kill them all you have to avoid them and run.* You can't sprint for a more than 5 meters before Alan burns all his stamina and starts to walk. Enemies catch up with you in a few seconds. You can use flashlight to make them keep the distance, but since they can throw their unlimited axes and knives that doesn't really helping. You have to use dodge mechanics.* You can't use dodge mechanics reliably when multiple projectiles are incoming and while you dodging 1-2 axes at once enemies are closing in.* Game suggests you to explore to find missing pages to unfold some plot, possible collectibles and ammo, but if you go explore you will be spammed by enemies you can't kill because you will run out of ammo.* Enemies could spawn at point blank range behind a tree you stand by, behind a boulder, even behind your back. You turn around to see if there is enemies - no, but in an instant there they are ready to strike.* Poorly ballanced ammo placements and sooo low max ammo cap is the last nail in game's coffin.To sum up you can't fight back because of ammo, you can't outrun because of stamina, you can't explore because of respawns, you can't dodge reliably, you can't keep enemies at distance with constantly discharging flashlight. I can't believe combat in this game is sooo broken and gameplay is so unrealistic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An entertaining game with an interesting and well presented story.

												This is a really good port of the original 360 game that came out in the Year of Twin Peaks, 2010. As with its counterpart, Deadly Premonition, gameplay takes a backseat to storytelling and atmosphere. Combat is fun, but becomes repetitive and boring. The collectables in this game are some of the worst ever because while they are important to the story, searching for them actually interrupts the flow of the narrative.This game comes with both the DLC packs, which I enjoyed. Level design was lacking on the first episode, but the second one came with enough new maps that it didn't feel like a cop-out from a level design perspective.This review is part of my project to mention Deadly Premonition as much as I can on STEAM.UPDATE: Clearly my efforts have paid off, as Deadly Premonition is now ON STEAM.

												An excellent horror game that you won't want to stop playing once you get into it. The game has a great, tense story that really makes you want to see what happens next. I thought the gameplay in this game was pretty unique because the enemies in this game are controlled by the darkness, and to kill them, you can't just shoot them, you have to shine your flashlight on them to burn the darkness away and then you can shoot them. But the darkness gets stronger as you progress through the game and when there are multiple strong enemies, it can get pretty challenging. The cutscenes are also done very well and very fun to watch. And the environments are beautiful and really fit the atmosphere. This game is also great for people looking for a great horror game that isn't over the top with violence, gore and language; because this horror game actually managed to get away with a T rating. This is one of the greatest horror games ever made, and when Steam puts this game on sale for only $2.99, you HAVE to buy this, you can't pass on that deal and $2.99 is like... nothing, so amazing deal from Steam.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.Recommended. On the fence. Play it when hell freezes over. Avoid like the plague.It's powerful, suspenseful, and has enough story to fill a novel. Keep in mind, that's mostly what the game is - a cinematic experience. If it's not your cup of tea, then don't bother. You are Alan Wake, a famous author on vacation who suddenly realizes the stories he wrote have come to life. These stories are no ordinary stories mind you, they are horror stories that want something in particular from Wake. That's when the game truly begins. It is a psychological horror, entirely story driven, that will have you questioning what's real and what's not. Alan Wake is very similar to any TV series - released in episodic content to keep you on the edge of your seat. There's 6 episodes totaling 2-3 hours each of playtime with 2 bonus DLC episodes (approximately 2 hours). Overall you are looking at nearly a 20 hour game. There's also a stand-alone follow-up called Alan Wake's American Nightmare. The gameplay is fairly straightforward - you are equipped with a flashlight and pistol. The flashlight is used to hurt the enemies by shining light on them and the pistol is used to kill them for good. The enemies themselves are hard to describe without ruining the game - essentially they are a paranormal darkness that stalk Wake and members of the community. The game borrows its inspiration heavily from Stephen King novels, Alfred Hitchcock, and the 90s TV show Twin Peaks. Most of the game you'll find yourself running from enemies, battling them, or solving a minor puzzle. Everything is there to drive the story forward. It's more exploration and survival based as opposed to run n gun. Overall, Remedy presented us with the definitive cinematic experience of psychological horrors. It's got an amazing atmosphere, a very fitting soundtrack and score, and the graphics are beautiful. As a game however, it loses points for being limited in what you do. The game gets a solid 7.5/10 from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From the makers of Max Payne comes a thriller originally released exclusively on the Xbox360 in 2010. Remedy finally did what it promised to PC gamers a long time ago.As a Remedy fan I had to preorder this, and I was pleased to see this as a port done right, even though the game was meant to be a Windows Vista exclusive in the first place.Because of Micro$oft's tyranny over the IP, many PC gamers felt left down. Some even built new computers just to play this game back in the day.In Alan Wake you collect manuscript pages, damn fine coffee in thermos and shoot stacked beer cans. Light is your key to survival against the dark forces, which try to stop you as you are looking for your loved one. Exciting!If you like Twin Peaks, X-Files, Twilight Zone and Roy Orbison's In Dreams, this is the game for you. Story has been divided into parts to represent a TV series. Gameplay mechanics may be old for some and the combat gets repetitive towards the end, but nevertheless it is still an exciting psychological thriller.Alan Wake surprised many of us by making it's sudden appearance on Steam, and this time on the right platform on which it belongs!For people who like to tweak their games a little there are a number of good SweetFX profiles for the game that sharpens the image, adds more depth to colors and makes the game look overall less washed out. Try 'em!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, so first of all Alan Wake is my favourite game of all time! But why is it so good, there are many reasons (without spoilers):1. The story is so awesome and well written and different from normal that it keeps surprising you and sometimes you just wonder that why did they tell me all this information, to add more depth to all of the characters and places wich brings me to my next reasons.2. Characters are all different from each other and you can see that how much they put effort for just making each character feel more real, by their looks, movement and their way of thinking cause they are all so different from each other.3. The atmoshpere is awesome! All those little details looks awesome and the light elements are just stunning. It's really dark in the woods but the way Remedy made he light work is just so beatifull! It's so cool seeing it going trough every little holy you can find!4. Gameplay is different than normally 3rd person games are. It's one of the best games to make that cinematic feeling from slow-motion dodges and even when you are just walking in a forest.5.The combat is very cool feeling. First, you have to get enough light to an enemy that it's darkness wears off so you can shoot it. There are not many weapons, but the game doesn't suffer from that. There are also flares, flare guns, flash granades and 3 different flashlight to give you the upper hand.6. The light is the most important thing in the game cause if you have light, you might survive, might. But all the reflections and the light sneeking out from the dark and saving your ♥♥♥ just when you thought you would die, it's just awesome!7. Re-play value is great in this game cause when you beat the game you will unlock nightmare difficulty wich is harder but not so hard that you will rage quit, but it's there so that you would play the game again knowing abot all the stuff and what's gonna happen when you read the pages. 8. Graphics in this game are not perfect but very detailed and cool looking, just perfect for this world.9. Landscape is just so awesome, sometimes you just stop in the middle of the game and just look at the most beatifull enviroment ever in games and take screenshots so that you could make that your new screensaver.10. The game itself tooks about 13-20 hours to complete with the dcl's so it's a good lenght.Those are the main reasons why you should buy this game, I don't recommend Alan Wake Americas Nightmare so much cause it could have been a great game but compared to the original tittle, it's just so awfull. But go buy the game before they release the new one so you could play that one too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like it! It feels a lot like Heavy Rain, but not as crappy. As in, it's got a great aesthethic to it, and a story that feems very engaging. Gameplay is... well, it's kinda fun, but it's rather slow and not that great. But the gameplay really isn't the focus.I wish I could keep playing, to see if the story is actually worth it or if it's another Heavy Rain. I'd keep playing, but... I've got other games I want to go through first. I'll probably get back to it eventually.In other words, what I'm trying to say is, don't play Heavy Rain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is an excellent single player title if you enjoy mild horror and a linear story. The protagonist, Alan, is on vacation when his wife gets presumed kidnapped by the supernatural. Needless to say, the game is mostly about Alan Wake trying to rescue his wife. The game is full of cut scenes, which may be skipped if you're the rushing type, which really add to the story and give the player a ""break."" Trying to tackle this game for the 100% achievements is actually proving to be easier than I first thought. Huge props to a steam guide with youtube videos for each Episode in Alan Wake.

												If you are a fan of the story in Max Payne 1 and Max Payne 2 then you will enjoy this story even more, the game plays different as you dont have bullet time, but when you dodge attacks time slows briefly giving you a chance to kill one of the taken.You main weapon is light and you need to remove the darkness before you can kill any of the taken. I recommand you play though the game for the storyline and try and collect all manuscript pages at the same time if you can.  You will have some down time when you dont kill anyone, but it does add to you feeling safe even if its brief.The DLC extra chapters also adds greatly to the overall story and experience,Game gets a 10/10 for me, if you loved Max Payne your love this			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wak is a very interesting game all in its own. Theres a huge cult following and after playing it, I can understand why. This game has a very interesting plot and really makes you question if Alan is truely insane or if he's actually experiencing this in the real world. It has a very good plot and very good story... but as a game, its lacking.1. The gameplay is bland as hell.You walk around the forest and follow a linear path to the end of the game. You point a flashlight at enamies and then shoot them. Thats it. Thats all you do the entire game. It is INCREDIBLY bland and gets very stale after a while. 2. The only thing worth remembering are cut-scenes. Unlike games like Heavy Rain where gameplay is indepth or interesting and open where you can explore the world, this is specifically linear gameplay. You can explore the world, but its VERY limited. You'll occasionally find things like better guns, or flashlights but theres nothing to discover. 3. ♥♥♥♥ING CARSThe controls for ANY vehicle in the game are absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Driving in this game is so bad I prefer walking a mile on feet instead of driving.... Lets not talk about offroad driving... OVERALL, its a very good story... but the key word is STORY. It is not a very good game. Butoverall, I enjoyed playing through this game. It was a great story and I dont' regret the time I spent playing it. It's definately worth a buy, but I would say wait until its on sale for 7-5 dollars. I got this game through a package with an i7 4770k so I can't complain about a free game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a breath of fresh air after having over saturated myself with FPS. The story is great and takes it self very seriously. The settings are all gorgeous, the audio is great, and the game plays very well. Voice acting was ok, and character animation (namely on Alice) was a bit lack luster at times. Making her look very un-natural. The cinimatics, story telling, and fun game play mechanics are what makes this game shine. Recommend.			",124,25,1,14,17,1,14

												I fell in love with this game. I don't really know why since it can be really buggy at times, most of the voice actors sound like they're reading a menue, the glitches and the fact that it broke down on me more times than I can remember. But somewhere amongst cursing over the latest crash or making fun of the voice actors and the all to predictable enemy ai I fell in love with the story that was unfolding before me. It's something about the  setting together with the plot that is actually very good that made it impossible for me to stop playing this game! I won't give you a big fancy review or anything but I will tell you this. If you're looking for a great story set in a realy atmospheric setting you've found it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished this game to be able to give it a honest rating. Yes, It starts pretty well, then every episode is just slide down. After finishing the main story I tried to play special episodes but I just dropped it, same locations and no story just more shooting. The only good thing about this game is that it is I think first game of its console-adventures that was ported to PC. I played this game with long breaks for almost two years. I still can't find anything so  appealing to so many people in this game.  Boring, bad story, cliched, too much shooting and not enough dialogs. Oh and characters are just screaming to get to know them better but there are basicaly no dialogs. Well its not Quantum Dreams game  anyways. So, should you play it? Yes BUT only if you play with xbox360 controller and its your first time with consoles-adventure. My verdict 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic experience! The storytelling of Alan Wake is done extremely well. The game is divided into tv-like episodes complete with cliffhangers at the end of each. Cutscenes, collectable text manuscripts, listening to Alan think outloud all do a great job telling the story. The game starts out feeling like an atmospheric horror game. Once you meet the protagonist's best friend, there is plenty of comical banter between the two. The combat mechanic is elegantly simple and surprisingly doesnt ever get repetitive.  The game does a good job introducing upgrades to your items as you progress through the story.The pc port is done very well. As old as the game is, the ingame assets still look great. The only thing that might look dated is Alan's hair. It took be about 18 hours to complete. I highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one game I really, really wanted to like. The beginning looked so promising, too - I was delighted by the intriguing story with its strong Stephen King vibe, and the creepy atmosphere was exhilarating! I bravely set off into the dark woods, armed with only a flashlight and a pistol, to see what lies ahead. It's been a year and I still haven't finished the game. The whole dark, creepy woods thing gets boring after a while, and every time I got my hopes up, thinking that maybe, just maybe, Alan Wake will do something during daytime, there was an unforeseen turn of events and surprise, here we are in the forest again. Ugh! Even more frustrating were the clunky keyboard controls, which caused Alan to duck at the beginning of every sprint and completely lose all coordination when jumping. Using a controller, he handles a bit better, but it still shows his port-y nature. I recommend this game for patient people with controllers. I can see how it could be a really great game, and story-wise, it already is. For me, however, repetitive missions and horrible controls led to a love-hate relationship with this game.

												This game does a thousand things incredibly well that makes the experience completely worthwhile.  Unfortunately, it also stumbles a few times with repetitive gameplay.The good:-Story is very well written, though perhaps a bit unevenly paced-Voice acting is phenomenal-Musical score is incredible (and included in the collector's edition)-Visual effects are great-Gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to learn and many puzzles are well designed-DLC (included) did a great job of keeping things fresh after a lengthy main gameThe bad:-Mostly just one - combat gets very repetitive.  Before long, every time you see the signs that you'll be entering combat, you'll just want to get it over with to get to the next plot point.  They did what they could to make the combat environments, situations, etc as interesting as possible, but it feels like the enemies late in the game are the same as those in the beginning, just with thicker skin.Fortunately, they mixed things up a bit at the end of the game and in the 2 ""episodes"" that follow.  Ultimately, you'll finish the game feeling satisfied.  And for a few bucks more (less if it's on sale!), pick up American Nightmare too.  It's worth it.Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a deep & thought provoking work of fiction, its story is engaging & extremely well written. Tense & exciting from beginning to end with an episodic structure to the game that only picks up pace the further you delve into the mysteries of Bright Falls.   Alan wake Deals with the line between fiction and fact, and creativity, this game filters them through tv shows like Twin Peaks, the novels of Stephen King, and throws in references to Edgar Allan Poe, amongst others, to great effect.  Not intended to be seen as a shoot-em-up style game, this is one for adventurers who like a well-crafted puzzler of a plot, and rewards paying careful attention to the events therein.

												This game was a lot of fun to play and to look at. The graphics aren't unbelievable or anything (the facial graphics are particularly lackluster), but the way they all come together to create such an immersive atmostphere really makes the game worth playing IMO.The story itself is pretty cool, although it seriously leaves you hanging. Or at least it did for me. I found out after the fact that there exists a DLC that provides a somewhat more conclusive ending, but it is not available on PC. I think.Still, very cool game. I'm hesitant to call it a horror game, as it isn't really about the scares. Although there weren't really any scares, now that I think about it. I would categorize it as a supernatural thriller of sorts.Game play is super cool and different. It plays somewhat like a FPS/RPG blend, with a couple of added features here and there that were refreshing to me.I loved the play on light/dark, etc. Cool themes. Honestly, my only complaint with this game is the plot. Could have been super cool, instead plays more like a kinda cool story.So play it for what was to me a unique gaming experience, with super interesting graphics and atmosphere. Don't go in expecting a superb story, a la Red Dead Redemption or Bioshock.7/10, would recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												David Lynch's Twin Peaks meets Nolan's Insomnia. A game that feels like a television show because of the episodial narrative, and still delivers on the kind of fun that you'd expect from a video game. Visceral combat mechanics, lush graphics, eerie storyline, and full of memorable characters and quotes. I definitey recommend this for the avid mystery enthusiast or for newcomers to the genre.

												I have played this plus the DLCs through on X360, and can honestly say that this is one of my favorite games of all time. The graphics, sounds, music all together create a psychological thriller with a chilling atmosphere, that is on par with other great titles such as Bioshock or The Swapper. Alan Wake takes it's influence from many works of cult fiction such as Alone in the Dark and Twin Peaks. The plot itself is quite twisted, but thanks to the brilliantly executed storytelling, Remedy has made sure that anyone can catch up with the narrative. But, as with every game, this game has few flaws. First of all, the combat, which at first is quite fun, starts to come a bit dull towards the end of the game. More types of enemies would be needed. And the second flaw that I have experienced is the driving. Controls just feel too clumsy. Thankfully these flaws are quite minor, as the game is most certainly meant to deliver an brilliantly executed story. A goal which it sure exceedes on a great margin. 9+/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Alan Wake"" is one of those special gems you find only once a year by sifting through the normal copy & paste trash developers give gamers every year. The combination of survival horror and narrative thriller gives this game a mysterious life and pulls you, the gamer, into the story. When playing you will be on the edge of your seat moving to hurry through the darkness, trying anticiapte what happenes next and to finish the chapter and reach daylight. However, You will also feel the urge to not put down the controller and head back into the darkness as if you are watching your favorite tv or movie series and just need to get your fix by seeing what the next episode or ""chapter"" is going to hold. Easily a 5/5!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake, this was a game that I was really excited to play. I was unable to purchase this game for quite some time due to financial funds but I have it now and I am thrilled to write review of Remedy Entertainment’s Alan Wake. Alan Wake is a third person survival horror about… you guessed it right, Alan Wake. A famous writer, who has been having troublesome nightmares do to his writer’s block. Because of his writer’s block, he and his wife have decided to a vacation to Bright Falls. Which seems to be ironic because the game is all about darkness. Upon arriving in Bright Falls things go bad fast with Alan’s wife being kidnapped after an argument with Alan. Immediately after his wife goes missing, Alan makes his best efforts to track her down. Throughout his time of searching for his wife, he starts to have trouble telling the difference between his nightmares and reality. Now, of the survival horror games that I have played, Alan Wake is very different almost very aspect. The biggest and most important difference is the narrative. The story is being told by Alan Wake as you are playing through the game. The game takes on a audio book type feel. This helps the player feel more connected to Alan and gives a better understanding of Alan’s character development. The story is not only told by Alan but also through tv rewinds. As you begin each episode of Alan Wake, a “previously on Alan Wake…” cutscene will start telling what occurred in the previous episode.These two narratives truly make Alan Wake have a unique type of storytelling compared other survival horror games. While most other horror games just want to try and scary the pants off of you, the creators of Alan Wake actually wanted to tell a story and make the player feel as one with the character while still making the player feel uneasy as they play. Alan Wake uses a flashlight and revolver to kill the Taken, the people or objects that are taken by the dark. Through out the game you will find other tools and weapons such as improved flashlights, flares, etc. that will have you get pass the swarms of Taken. You encounter several different types of Taken, powerful in their own way but still weak to light. When encountering Taken there were many times where I found it challenging to kill or even run away. I wish I could blame it on the combat mechanics but it worked so well even without a melee feature. It was difficult to kill the Taken because while I was trying to purify one there would three or four other Taken that spawn and start throwing axes or that run up to me and start hitting me with what seemed to a never ending combo. It got to a point where, I couldn’t seem to kill all of the Taken that attacking me so decided to run. That did not seem to work, not even half the time. I was unable to escape them either because Alan got tired from sprinting, the Taken were faster than me, or because when I was running to a light that would ironically blow out. The only other thing that made this game frustrating was the clunkyness of controlling Alan Wake. There were moments when I went to grab an item and I would fall off a ledge because I needed to turn or when I wanted dodge and I would end up sprinting, because my default sprint and dodge key were the same shift key. Theses issues do not ruin Alan Wake’s story or thag the but they do cause it to be frustrating, so just be prepared to die…a few times. Now when it comes to the visuals of Alan Wake, you will be anything but frustrated. The game is run on a Havok engine, the same as L.A. Noire, which means they are clean and seamless cinematics. The cinematics aren’t the only thing that looks good but the actual gameplay visuals themselves are unbelievable. It was amazing when I was standing on the side of a mountain and I was able to clearly see the neon lights of a gas station and know that it was a gas station, not look like an 8-bit jpeg gas station that you could barely tell was a gas staion. Even if you do not usually play survival horror games, you should definitely play Alan Wake for its visual greatness. Alan Wake is an outstanding game. The story is in depth, different and yet still scary while never losing focus of the character development of Alan. The visuals are unbelievably shocking. The narrative of the story will suck you in and have you wanting more. The clunky controls were the only negative, even though they were not enough to ruin the game, they do tend to cause some frustration. Alan Wake was definitely worth the purchase, so if you have the chance to add this game to your library, do it.""It’s not a lake. It’s an ocean."" - Alan WakeCheck out more of my reviews at TheLightSkinNerd.tumblr.com or TheLightSkinNerd.wordpress.comFollow me on Twitter @KingTroyseph			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is maybe the best narrative-driven game I've ever played. It has solid action and some of the best graphics I've seen, but it's the immersiveness of the story-telling that really enraptures me.If you ever enjoyed The Stanley Parable or Catherine, this is a must.I really wish there were more of these games out on PC; I wouldn't mind trying out Deadly Premonition, Heavy Rain and Fahrenheit.I should also mention that I find it unbelievable that this is ported from consoles, as it has precise controls and runs absolutely perfectly, despite the obviously advanced graphical features.Remember to play with HUD and captions off, and aiming control set to ""direct aiming"" (no mouse acceleration) for maximum immersion and enjoyment.

												Alan Wake is a highly immersive horror experience with a suspenseful and carefully developed storyline. I began the game with high expectations, and finished with nothing short of satisfaction. The game's unique idea of an artist's immersion in his own unwritten story gives a feel of it's own, not to mention it's ambience and narration to make the player feel like the protagonist of a well-written horror novel. The game also has its comic relief to lighten the mood of an otherwise dark setting.The game made me laugh, jump, and nearly beat a tear out of me at some points.As much as I'd like to say I don't have any complaints, I do have some disagreement with the gameplay. The combat mechanic, though unique in itself, was very repetitive, as it didn't change throughout the game for the most part.Considering the gameplay to be of highly less significance than the story, I would still consider this to be one of the best games I've ever played. The moment I started playing it, I never wanted to stop. I have faith that I can say the same for those who wish to purchase the game. Storywise? 5 stars.Gameplay? 4 stars.Give it a shot.

												I really enjoyed this game. I would describe it as a Horror/Thriller Story based adventure game. The setting is a small town called Bright Falls which has a slight hick feel to it. The surrounding area is dark and misty, with forrest, a lake and cliff areas that really give the impression of a realistic setting. There are many clever touches to the game to create a creepy, surreal atmosphere. Such as TV's turning on and you being on the screen talking illogically. Flashbacks and nightmares. Missing time etc. The story is well written and makes you feel like your immersed in a novel. The characters are believable and are all interesting as there roles develop. The voice acting is excelllent and feels genuine, The gameplay is fun with lots of adventuring and taking in the surroundings. The biggest negative is slightly repetitive combat but even this is fun for the most part. Overall a great game. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall, Alan Wake is very well made when it comes to storytelling. As you play, you get to collect manuscripts which contain your story - its past, present and future. It is an interesting way to provide some insight into the background of what is happening somewhere else at the same time, or what will happen to our protagonist in a moment - very unique. The combat is very simple but nevertheless, still fun as you gain access to a variety of weapons such as flashbangs or flares which enhance the experience rather than just simply making it shooter game. I also enjoyed the characters, there were not too many but each of them was memorable and had impact on the story. What I'd like to bring up was the animation of characters' mouths during cinematic cutscenes. Most of the time it looked poorly made but let's keep in mind the game's 7 years old now so for that matter, it's as good as it could be - but then I'd just be trying really hard to find mistakes in the game. Developer's commentary brings something really new to the game. You can turn this feature on in the settings which I suggest to do on your second playthrough. You will get some really interesting info from the developers about the game and the story, it's sometimes played over the game's dialogues and contains spoilers often so make sure you don't turn it on during your first playthrough.If you're really into games that focus on story with horror atmosphere, Alan Wake is the way to go, surely enjoyable experience that I haven't had perhaps in good 2 years.[9.5/10] ",8,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Easily, one of the best, if not the best, horror action games I've ever played. This story is a loveletter to the works of Stephen King, H.P. Lovecraft and the filmworks of David Lynch. The atmosphere is as choking and brooding as the bottom of Cauldron Lake itself. The action can be tense, and unrelenting, especially at higher difficulties, don't be afraid to just run as fast as you can to a safe haven. It can be a bit of an old fashioned collect-a-thon if you want the full story, but the immersion is worth it. The soundtrack is perfect, ranging from the melancholy of Poe to Bowie to Depeche Mode. It's a fantastic journey and storyline that kept me at the edge of my seat the entire way through, with a flashlight... Just in case.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really good port of the original 360 game that came out in the Year of Twin Peaks, 2010. As with its counterpart, Deadly Premonition, gameplay takes a backseat to storytelling and atmosphere. Combat is fun, but becomes repetitive and boring. The collectables in this game are some of the worst ever because while they are important to the story, searching for them actually interrupts the flow of the narrative.This game comes with both the DLC packs, which I enjoyed. Level design was lacking on the first episode, but the second one came with enough new maps that it didn't feel like a cop-out from a level design perspective.This review is part of my project to mention Deadly Premonition as much as I can on STEAM.UPDATE: Clearly my efforts have paid off, as Deadly Premonition is now ON STEAM.

												An excellent horror game that you won't want to stop playing once you get into it. The game has a great, tense story that really makes you want to see what happens next. I thought the gameplay in this game was pretty unique because the enemies in this game are controlled by the darkness, and to kill them, you can't just shoot them, you have to shine your flashlight on them to burn the darkness away and then you can shoot them. But the darkness gets stronger as you progress through the game and when there are multiple strong enemies, it can get pretty challenging. The cutscenes are also done very well and very fun to watch. And the environments are beautiful and really fit the atmosphere. This game is also great for people looking for a great horror game that isn't over the top with violence, gore and language; because this horror game actually managed to get away with a T rating. This is one of the greatest horror games ever made, and when Steam puts this game on sale for only $2.99, you HAVE to buy this, you can't pass on that deal and $2.99 is like... nothing, so amazing deal from Steam. Rating: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Increadibly good. Between it's smart flash and fight system and the moderetly scary atmosphere present through out the game it is really a game to behold. I highly recomend you go and pay for it now or atleast watch some gameplay.Also check out Alan Wake's American nightmare, it's shorter but just as good. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												85%Alan Wake is an amazing game, very well written and with a great ambience and characters, however that doesn't mean it's perfect.First of gameplay, the basic combat mechanic for fighting is very interesting at first, basically you need to use a flashlight to drain the enemy's ""shields"" until you are able to take him down with a gun, but over the course of the game it grows a bit stale and repetitive, with little to no change at all. Trying the different weapons and traps whoever is pretty fun, you'll spend a lot of time trying to find creative ways to take down your enemies, although sometimes it is better to run. Ammo is scarce, which is nice for a thriller game and the way the story develops in game is pretty interesting (like finding the pages).Now for story, this is where the game truly shines. It's incredible, worthy of a book even. Wake's story place nicely as a psychological action thriller that is well paced and keeps you engaged, the game also features some pretty interesting plot twists, making even the chapters in between battles pretty thrilling. The dialogue and characters are very well written, I can even recall several quotes now.If you are a fan of Stephen King esque novels than this is the game for you, sometimes it may grow repetitive but that can be easily forgiving by the engaging story and amazing atmosphere.Alan Wake is a game that proves to be more than what it seems, truly defining that ""It is not a lake, it's an ocean"".

The story reminds me of ""Silent Hill"" series and ""Siren"" series. The countryside graphics is belivable enoughWhat I do not like:Control is poor to my standard. Takes a lot of time to learn to control the character's movement.High computer specs is needed to get good graphics and less lag.			",87,6,0,12,1,0,1

												I entered the game trusting only the reviews. Somehow, the numbers didn't fail me - on most parts of  the game, at least.Gameplay's quite unique. You can't just shoot the enemies on sight, you have to weaken them first using any source of light. The answer to the 'why' is heavily related to the story. There were also some puzzles that weren't really head-scratching. Easy ones if I may say so. A thing about combat I didn't like is it isn't easy to find out if the area you're in has an infinte respawn of the enemies. You'll clear a wave carefully and the next thing you know, they respawn 3 seconds right after you cleared them, repeat.The story's good in the sense that it's really gripping. Almost the same level of 'gripping' as Bioshock Infinite with the use of twists and mind♥♥♥♥s. I'll also add that if you're a fan of games with 'notes' in them, you'll be so into this. Almost every part of the game has one for you to find.The songs used in the game, especially the one in the ending, suits the story in their tone. The effects weren't something you'd have to applaud to. And every damn time Barbara Jagger appears in Alan Wake's mind, man, get ready for a '♥♥♥♥ you' from your headphones'. I totally suggest you use loudness equalization. So, yeah. Score's a meh.I recommend this game, but barely. The one con that I really wanna mention are some of the achievements. Most of the time, you're in a forest/mountain-ish settings, and you have to collect: Coffee Thermoses (A hundred of these.) Manuscripts (A hundred as well.) Chests. Pyramid of cans to shoot.And maybe other things I couldn't care less to remember. In forest and mountain areas. In fuuuuuu- forest and mountain areas. Most probably, you'll have to revisit these areas just to find and collect them all. Talk about like playing Pokemon Go but there are darkness-controlled people trying to axe you in half and slice your head thru throwing sickles.Well, anyway, the story makes it all so much worth it.*David Bowie music plays*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a interesting take on a ""horror"" type game. You are Alan Wake, a famous writer haunted by nightmares of dark figures trying to murder you.  Alan Wake is not that terrifying to the point where you refuse to play the game or dont want to simply because of how scary it is. It will keep pulling you in with its fun and interesting gameplay.Pros: refreshing new take on horror, fun, atmospheric and thrilling, no cheap scaresCons: very difficult, nearly impossible at some pointsAlan wake on my scale of 1-5, i would give it a 4.5 out of 5. Albeit being a difficult game, Alan Wake has great mechanics and creative ways of killing your scary foes. This game is great for a person who likes horror games but doesnt like to be scared badly.

But the first half of this combat system is really just great.but its magic is killed by unnecessary .Would have liked to see only use the light without gun .It would be better for this story..Btw that was a wonderful experience...

												This is an amazing game in most aspects. The style of story telling is very unique in video games, and I loved it. The main character is a writer, and his horror stories are coming true. I loved seeing the other real life characters slowly realize that they were in a land of fiction, one of the greatest strengths of the story is that you never really know if you are in the real world or not. The plot is basically the light vesus the dark. The visuals are very nice, and the distortion caused by the darkness taking over is done well. The combat is unique and for the most part good. You must use your flashlight (or someother light source) to kill the darkness around the enemies, and then shoot them to actually kill them for good. It gets a bit repetitive, and can be awkward in close quarters. In the later half of the game, driving becomes more prevelent, which is bad because the cars handle like bathtubs. This game is also frequently only three dollars, and its easly worth it then. It took me about 14 hours to finish the entire story, including the ""special"" episodes, so its a decently long game. (And I was not looking for every collectable, I only got maybe half of them.)Pros: +Story+Graphics+Atmosphere+Characters+Discounted priceNeutral:*Majority of the combat*ReplayabiltyBad:-Close quarters combat-Driving (Though it is satisfying driving over the dark ones with a car...)Overall: 8.5/10 Buy this game while its on sale.

												Excellent story, gameplay and environment. You need to play this game at least for the story. Alan Wake won't disappoint you. It isn't a perfect game mainly due to the somewhat repetitive action sequences, but its core is in the fantastic plot and storytelling.			",548,250,30,49,72,9,94

												Alan Wake. Alan Wake is an annoying pretentious white guy. The game is based on books by STEPHEN KING. And it likes STEPHEN KING. I mean really really likes STEPHEN KING. Alan wake writes books. Kind of like STEPHEN KING. Did I mention STEPHEN KING is in this game? Because he is. Alan finds himself in a story, one which he cant remember writing, but he does remember that its based on STEPHEN KING. Along the way, Alan discovers the power of ENERGIZER™ batteries. The game also really likes ENERGIZER™ batteries. Alan uses ENERGIZER™ batteries. The game centres around burning enemies with ENERGIZER™ light, from an ENERGIZER™ flashlight, powered by ENERGIZER™ batteries. The final boss fight involves Alan taking the ENERGIZER™ batteries from STEPHEN KING. Seriously though its good. BUY ANY STEPHEN KING BOOK NOW AND GET A FREE PACKET OF ENERGIZER™ BATTERIES!

												This game excels in many ways and in short -- you should buy it.Most captivating is the atmosphere. This game was developed by Microsoft and it is very apparent that they took inspiration from their home state of Washington. The vast temperate rain forests containing abundant lakes coupled with cloudy skies truly strengthen the setting. Taking on a vibe of mystery and horror the story of Alan Wake is also quite interesting. I'll be honest I mostly play games for the story much like one would read a book or watch a movie. In this regard Alan Wake was incredibly fun but at times I also found myself ""grinding"" through the game in a sense, wishing to simply continue the story. I suffered from one or two ""rage quit"" moments but ultimately pressed on and I am glad I did. Another refreshing strength of this game is the unique gameplay. The combination of the flashlight weaponry with unique puzzles and challenges is very refreshing compared to other games and made the game less monotonous. All in all, while not perfect, Alan Wake is a very enjoyable game and everyone should play through it once.			",182,41,5,14,33,2,15

												Solid story to a game thats very unique. Sounds weird I know 'use a torch on enemies then shoot them', however the gameplay stands firm. The dark atmosphere along with the intriguingly weird story keep you gripped the whole game through. If you like a game that looks good, has a captivating story as well as a little bit of action then I would pick this up. Played it several times on console and on PC and willl no doubt again.

												Alan Wake is what you get if you take a Stephen King novel and put it in a town oddly reminiscent of Twin Peaks. It weaves a great narrative around some tight third person shooter gameplay that stays satisfying to the conclusion of the main game. Just like a serialized TV drama, each episode ends on a cliffhanger leading to a cutscene with credits, and each episode begins with a ""last time on Alan Wake"" synopsis. That by itself would probably be irritating to some, but the way the story is told works great with that kind of episodic pace.It'll probably last you about a dozen hours if you play through once, with maybe another 2-4 hours tacked on if you play the DLC (free with the PC version). Although the game doesn't run into the issue that other games do of feeling ""too long,"" I did get fatigued by the time I was nearing the end of my first playthrough; I'll admit that could have been because I played this at release on the 360, though, so your mileage may vary. The narrative continuation in the DLC is fantastic, as are the new visual elements brought about by nature of where it takes place, but both pieces suffer from way too much frustrating combat. The second piece also suffers from particularly frustrating bits of ""platforming,"" which don't work well at all.Not a huge deal looking at the bigger picture, however, so if you're looking to play a well made horror game that isn't bogged down by awful combat for once, this is it!

												Alan Wake is an excellent single player title if you enjoy mild horror and a linear story. The protagonist, Alan, is on vacation when his wife gets presumed kidnapped by the supernatural. Needless to say, the game is mostly about Alan Wake trying to rescue his wife. The game is full of cut scenes, which may be skipped if you're the rushing type, which really add to the story and give the player a ""break."" Trying to tackle this game for the 100% achievements is actually proving to be easier than I first thought. Huge props to a steam guide with youtube videos for each Episode in Alan Wake.

												Alan Wake from the makers of Max Payne and Max Payne 2, is a unique game.Alan Wake isn't about action or shooting lots of enemies with a slow motion ability,this game is about some horror elements, storytelling, survival. When Alan Wake came out on PC I was a little skeptical about this game didn't had high hopesand how wrong I was to ever doubt this game. The atmosphere is brilliant, the story is amazing, the intense gameplay and interesting characters makes Alan Wake one of my favorite games. I recommend this game to EVERYONE, Alan Wake is a great game which needs to get more attention from the gamers.			",447,83,8,41,16,5,50

												I like it! It feels a lot like Heavy Rain, but not as crappy. As in, it's got a great aesthethic to it, and a story that feems very engaging. Gameplay is... well, it's kinda fun, but it's rather slow and not that great. But the gameplay really isn't the focus.I wish I could keep playing, to see if the story is actually worth it or if it's another Heavy Rain. I'd keep playing, but... I've got other games I want to go through first. I'll probably get back to it eventually.In other words, what I'm trying to say is, don't play Heavy Rain.			",1107,438,35,132,114,11,221

												This is maybe the best narrative-driven game I've ever played. It has solid action and some of the best graphics I've seen, but it's the immersiveness of the story-telling that really enraptures me.If you ever enjoyed The Stanley Parable or Catherine, this is a must.I really wish there were more of these games out on PC; I wouldn't mind trying out Deadly Premonition, Heavy Rain and Fahrenheit.I should also mention that I find it unbelievable that this is ported from consoles, as it has precise controls and runs absolutely perfectly, despite the obviously advanced graphical features.Remember to play with HUD and captions off, and aiming control set to ""direct aiming"" (no mouse acceleration) for maximum immersion and enjoyment.

												Overall, Alan Wake is very well made when it comes to storytelling. As you play, you get to collect manuscripts which contain your story - its past, present and future. It is an interesting way to provide some insight into the background of what is happening somewhere else at the same time, or what will happen to our protagonist in a moment - very unique. The combat is very simple but nevertheless, still fun as you gain access to a variety of weapons such as flashbangs or flares which enhance the experience rather than just simply making it shooter game. I also enjoyed the characters, there were not too many but each of them was memorable and had impact on the story. What I'd like to bring up was the animation of characters' mouths during cinematic cutscenes. Most of the time it looked poorly made but let's keep in mind the game's 7 years old now so for that matter, it's as good as it could be - but then I'd just be trying really hard to find mistakes in the game. Developer's commentary brings something really new to the game. You can turn this feature on in the settings which I suggest to do on your second playthrough. You will get some really interesting info from the developers about the game and the story, it's sometimes played over the game's dialogues and contains spoilers often so make sure you don't turn it on during your first playthrough.If you're really into games that focus on story with horror atmosphere, Alan Wake is the way to go, surely enjoyable experience that I haven't had perhaps in good 2 years.[9.5/10] ",8,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Alan Wake is a highly immersive horror experience with a suspenseful and carefully developed storyline. I began the game with high expectations, and finished with nothing short of satisfaction. The game's unique idea of an artist's immersion in his own unwritten story gives a feel of it's own, not to mention it's ambience and narration to make the player feel like the protagonist of a well-written horror novel. The game also has its comic relief to lighten the mood of an otherwise dark setting.The game made me laugh, jump, and nearly beat a tear out of me at some points.As much as I'd like to say I don't have any complaints, I do have some disagreement with the gameplay. The combat mechanic, though unique in itself, was very repetitive, as it didn't change throughout the game for the most part.Considering the gameplay to be of highly less significance than the story, I would still consider this to be one of the best games I've ever played. The moment I started playing it, I never wanted to stop. I have faith that I can say the same for those who wish to purchase the game. Storywise? 5 stars.Gameplay? 4 stars.Give it a shot.

												I really enjoyed this game. I would describe it as a Horror/Thriller Story based adventure game. The setting is a small town called Bright Falls which has a slight hick feel to it. The surrounding area is dark and misty, with forrest, a lake and cliff areas that really give the impression of a realistic setting. There are many clever touches to the game to create a creepy, surreal atmosphere. Such as TV's turning on and you being on the screen talking illogically. Flashbacks and nightmares. Missing time etc. The story is well written and makes you feel like your immersed in a novel. The characters are believable and are all interesting as there roles develop. The voice acting is excelllent and feels genuine, The gameplay is fun with lots of adventuring and taking in the surroundings. The biggest negative is slightly repetitive combat but even this is fun for the most part. Overall a great game. 8/10			",363,183,6,52,48,7,63

												This game was a lot of fun to play and to look at. The graphics aren't unbelievable or anything (the facial graphics are particularly lackluster), but the way they all come together to create such an immersive atmostphere really makes the game worth playing IMO.The story itself is pretty cool, although it seriously leaves you hanging. Or at least it did for me. I found out after the fact that there exists a DLC that provides a somewhat more conclusive ending, but it is not available on PC. I think.Still, very cool game. I'm hesitant to call it a horror game, as it isn't really about the scares. Although there weren't really any scares, now that I think about it. I would categorize it as a supernatural thriller of sorts.Game play is super cool and different. It plays somewhat like a FPS/RPG blend, with a couple of added features here and there that were refreshing to me.I loved the play on light/dark, etc. Cool themes. Honestly, my only complaint with this game is the plot. Could have been super cool, instead plays more like a kinda cool story.So play it for what was to me a unique gaming experience, with super interesting graphics and atmosphere. Don't go in expecting a superb story, a la Red Dead Redemption or Bioshock.7/10, would recommend.			",81,42,0,18,7,0,2

												Summary:Graphics/Sound: 8/10Story: 10/10Gameplay: 4/10Overall: 7.5/10Graphics/SoundThe graphics and visuals look great and it all fits together pretty well. The atmosphere this game is going for is definitely accomplished. There were areas that looked accessible or looked like they ought to have some sort of significance but don’t due to just nothing being there or an invisiwwall/knee high barrier. There was also a few clipping issues but nothing that I took much notice of. The sound fits in very well too. They fit the overall theme. Voice acting was pretty good and I didn’t come across any sort of sound glitches.StoryI felt the story was amazing. It’s what kept me playing in all honesty. I felt like I could connect with the characters and understand what they were going through. The previous episode summaries were also nice touches that reminded you about what exactly is going on, especially if you had taken a break between episodes.GameplayGameplay was okay at first. Just a simple shine the light while backing away, shoot until dead, repeat. It very quickly became boring and tedious and the lack of enemy variety didn’t help either. I mostly only did the gameplay segments to get to the next story part.OverallIt's a pretty decent game. The story and visuals are great even if not the most original. Expect a slog through the gameplay segments after a while.  ",1264,476,34,165,92,14,156

												Now to writing an actual review.I'll begin saying what this review will conclude, and that is that this is a really good narrative-driven game.The game is basically a 3rd person shooter with puzzle elements and it is heavily narrative focused, that is both good and it's bad in the sense that the the developers have put so much time and effort into making the narrative that the gameplay suffered a heavy hit. The basic gameplay is focusing your flashlight on one of the few enemies (about 2 types if I remember correctly) and then shooting them with a selection of about 10 guns. This doesn't breake the game though, not in any way as the story is interesting and keeps you going, the episodic structure gives it a bit of uniqueness and the story in general is well thought thru. But, always a darn but, but well, the story isn't that memorable and the characters are a bit shallow, tho it doesn't matter too much as it is enough to keep you going. Think like Half-Life or something similar.Pros:+ Rather good story+ Good structure, well thought thru+ The woods are suprisingly a bit scaryNeutral:~ Not too fantastic graphics~ Can feel somewhat linear, but that is handled by the storyCons:- Lack of gameplay leads too game lacking a bit of variety			",197,47,7,17,29,2,37

												Original and interesting story! I have not seen a story like this in a long time!Basically you are a novelist Alan Wake who goes to this city of Bright Falls to get inspiration, but something about Bright Falls is mysterious and dangerous. You have to fight evil using a flashlight and a weapon (usually) instead of simple point and click shooting. The game has puzzles that are typically not to hard, but fun.The story is very interesting. I have all of the versions of the game and the story alone keeps me playing to find out what happens next.Pros:-good graphics for it's age-I played with the Xbox controller and it works well for controller support-it gets intense at times, as it is a horror themed game.-achievements are not all easy to get. In fact some seem very hard to get.Cons:-If you do not like games that kind of lead you on in DLC then that would be a down side. as the DLC continues the story. but it is not too expensive.-the game has some battles that are kinda pull your hair our frustrating. I played the game on normal, I could imagine playing it on nightmare.Highly Recommended. Not just for the gameplay, but for the story as well.			",94,8,0,13,7,1,10

												This game excels in many ways and in short -- you should buy it.Most captivating is the atmosphere. This game was developed by Microsoft and it is very apparent that they took inspiration from their home state of Washington. The vast temperate rain forests containing abundant lakes coupled with cloudy skies truly strengthen the setting. Taking on a vibe of mystery and horror the story of Alan Wake is also quite interesting. I'll be honest I mostly play games for the story much like one would read a book or watch a movie. In this regard Alan Wake was incredibly fun but at times I also found myself ""grinding"" through the game in a sense, wishing to simply continue the story. I suffered from one or two ""rage quit"" moments but ultimately pressed on and I am glad I did. Another refreshing strength of this game is the unique gameplay. The combination of the flashlight weaponry with unique puzzles and challenges is very refreshing compared to other games and made the game less monotonous. All in all, while not perfect, Alan Wake is a very enjoyable game and everyone should play through it once.			",182,41,5,14,33,2,15

												Alan Wake is what you get if you take a Stephen King novel and put it in a town oddly reminiscent of Twin Peaks. It weaves a great narrative around some tight third person shooter gameplay that stays satisfying to the conclusion of the main game. Just like a serialized TV drama, each episode ends on a cliffhanger leading to a cutscene with credits, and each episode begins with a ""last time on Alan Wake"" synopsis. That by itself would probably be irritating to some, but the way the story is told works great with that kind of episodic pace.It'll probably last you about a dozen hours if you play through once, with maybe another 2-4 hours tacked on if you play the DLC (free with the PC version). Although the game doesn't run into the issue that other games do of feeling ""too long,"" I did get fatigued by the time I was nearing the end of my first playthrough; I'll admit that could have been because I played this at release on the 360, though, so your mileage may vary. The narrative continuation in the DLC is fantastic, as are the new visual elements brought about by nature of where it takes place, but both pieces suffer from way too much frustrating combat. The second piece also suffers from particularly frustrating bits of ""platforming,"" which don't work well at all.Not a huge deal looking at the bigger picture, however, so if you're looking to play a well made horror game that isn't bogged down by awful combat for once, this is it!

												Truthfully, I didn't know what to expect when I first got into Alan Wake.  It looked like your standard ""point-flashlight and run"" sort of horror game.  I was pleasantly surprised, however.  Here is my rundown:Graphics:I am getting this out of the way as quickly as possible.  The game looks absolutely stunning.  The atmosphere is great, and the lighting features are wonderful.  You instantly know where to go when you see lighting.  I loved how this game looked.  Gameplay: Very unique.  Unveiling messages with the flashlight was a great idea.  Likewise, certain puzzles were done fantastically.  That being said, these unique ideas constantly were redone in some fashion or another to where it started to feel very overdone by the end of the game.  However, it was an enjoyable experience, even up to the end of the game.  Storyline:  Pretentious.  Very pretentious.  However, Alan Wake is a writer.  He will never let you forget that he is a writer, so the player shouldn't be surprised when the game has a very overly-artistic and dramatic feel to it.  It's annoying, at times, but not overtly so.  The game is great for what it is.  I'd highly recommend it for a playthrough.  You might find yourself getting tired of the repetition towards the end, but the payoff is very worth it.  If you would like to look at the game before you buy it, feel free to check out my let's play of the game:

At first it seems fine! But then Susan is tormented by the darkness and Alan rushes into the home only to find that his wife has been dragged into the water.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found the gameplay (especially first 15 hours) and story very dull but to be fair I am not kinda into this kind of games.  I am recommending this cos its a very good game with graphics still looking good like it was released in 2016.Gameplay is quite good and fun but repetetive, using flashlight to destroy the ""shadow shield"" of enemies to then finish them off with a gun. Unfortuned this game suffers from pretty bad problem that is variety or more like a lack of it. You weapon variety, enemy variety and locations that you gonna visit are quite boring and limited. Especially that this game is around 20 hours long and I don't know like you but its not fun to use same 3 guns to kill same 4 types of enemies whole time.Zero puzzles or doing anything other than walking forward and shooting, maybe sometimes driving for 30 seconds before you have to leave the car behind you.The story is really average. I understand that they tried to make it more like Stephen King with corny and cliche monsters, dialogue and other stuff, but  it have Stephen King's level of  stupid, confusing story with all plot holes, twists and all you actually do is walking from point A to point B while trying to ""fight the dark"", ""find your wife"" and discover that Silent Hill 2 did a similiar and way better story twist than this game. Also The Clicker is probably the most stupid MacGuffin ever. Not to mention how stupid and pathethit is that excuse for a finale boss. All you do is take flare gun, ammo from bottomless box and shoot 4 times into a tornado. I am dead serious. That is your reward for finishing the game. A fight with a tornado that takes less than 20 seconds  Its just nothing special about it and most of the time you probably end up skiping another none important and boring cutscene than watching it. The biggest problem in that you can't skip ANY dialogue and very often you gonna be forced for slow walking exposition. For people who hate collectibles - better avoid Alan Wake. You gonna collect a lot of stuff. Like a LOT. Also most of story is actually hidden behind finding manuscripts.I always put story in video games on the bottom of my list because I am into a good gameplay first, thats why I enjoyed Alan Wake gunplay so much. Its just that I didn't enjoyed the story to the point that I wanted to gave up on playing it but I finish it while repeating to myself ""this is so stupid"" many times. I still don't understand why everybody is keep telling me how Alan Wake story is so good. I just don't get it - its cliche, predictable and not much important for a player considering you just go forward from point A to point B. Oh well, thats just my opinion. Anyway I ofc recommend this game cos its very good and you can get it on 90% sale quite often. Give it a try.			",95,18,0,6,4,2,6

												My name isn't Alan Wake and I am not using a typewriter either.Alan Wake is a ""horror game"" , that isn't scary in any form - but shines with a brilliant storytelling and story in general.If you are expecting to be scared to death by this game, I honestly have to say :  You will not be scared.The atmosphere is gloomy and dark to say the least. The combat system has a nice touch, but it gets repetetive so damn fast, that you may start to just skip any fighting if you can, because it just bores you. Wether the game is difficult or not is hard to judge, but I considered it rather easy on "" HARD "" , but there's still "" NIGHTMARE "" for me to explore. So I guess it's okay, if you aren't into playing video games 24/7. The game features a really good soundtrack and voice acting. All in all the game is worth its money. When you are looking for a good story based game BUY IT - if you are looking for a game that scares the living s*** out of you DON'T BUY IT.			",62,8,1,11,2,0,8

												If you are a fan of the story in Max Payne 1 and Max Payne 2 then you will enjoy this story even more, the game plays different as you dont have bullet time, but when you dodge attacks time slows briefly giving you a chance to kill one of the taken.You main weapon is light and you need to remove the darkness before you can kill any of the taken. I recommand you play though the game for the storyline and try and collect all manuscript pages at the same time if you can.  You will have some down time when you dont kill anyone, but it does add to you feeling safe even if its brief.The DLC extra chapters also adds greatly to the overall story and experience,Game gets a 10/10 for me, if you loved Max Payne your love this			",161,27,2,34,3,2,8

												Alan Wak is a very interesting game all in its own. Theres a huge cult following and after playing it, I can understand why. This game has a very interesting plot and really makes you question if Alan is truely insane or if he's actually experiencing this in the real world. It has a very good plot and very good story... but as a game, its lacking.1. The gameplay is bland as hell.You walk around the forest and follow a linear path to the end of the game. You point a flashlight at enamies and then shoot them. Thats it. Thats all you do the entire game. It is INCREDIBLY bland and gets very stale after a while. 2. The only thing worth remembering are cut-scenes. Unlike games like Heavy Rain where gameplay is indepth or interesting and open where you can explore the world, this is specifically linear gameplay. You can explore the world, but its VERY limited. You'll occasionally find things like better guns, or flashlights but theres nothing to discover. 3. ♥♥♥♥ING CARSThe controls for ANY vehicle in the game are absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Driving in this game is so bad I prefer walking a mile on feet instead of driving.... Lets not talk about offroad driving... OVERALL, its a very good story... but the key word is STORY. It is not a very good game. Butoverall, I enjoyed playing through this game. It was a great story and I dont' regret the time I spent playing it. It's definately worth a buy, but I would say wait until its on sale for 7-5 dollars. I got this game through a package with an i7 4770k so I can't complain about a free game.			",69,8,2,6,3,0,14

Without doing all that you would probably get about 20ish hours of play time. I did like the story for this game, some parts were cheesy but I still enjoyed it. This game is listed as a horror game but in my opinion it was not very scary, some parts where creepy but not scary. I would consider this a “light” horror game (bad pun intended). Also another thing to note there were no jump scares, take that as you want.  Seeing as this is an older game I would not pick it up for full price, just wait for a sale.			",241,50,3,16,13,1,8

												Alan Wake is a really enjoyable survival ""horror"" game. The way the game is presented (as a TV show) actually fits perfectly into the quality of the story. It's a made for TV kind of scary, and that's not a bad thing. Every horror game doesn't need to be a scary as possible or a total gore fest. There is nothing wrong with more mild scares & the use of suspense to create tention. Though I only have 3+ hours in the Steam version, I played it all the way through on the 360. (Holy Crap does the 360 version run like assy-poo-poo)Score: 7.5/10Pros:-Engaging story-Well done voice acting-scares that aren't just cheap/lame jump scares-quality suspense-beautiful lighting effects-impressive & atmospheric visuals/graphics-fun story-fun/funny/interesting NPC'sCons:-irritating combat (not broken or anything just frustrating sometimes)- Uninspired enemies (ooooh smoke Zombie people, so origional)-too many collectables-one or two of the NPCs are obnoxious (your agent Dave for example)-bland weapons (not necessarily the games fault, it is set in the ""real"" world.Alan Wake is definitely worth picking up. Not at full price but anything under $20 is a worthwhile proposition. This is a great survival horror game for ""beginners"", kids, or anyone very easily scared. It looks great, it has a fun story & over all good voice work. By no means is Alan Wake perfect, but its fun and worth you time at the right price. Only the meanest, most bitter gamers wouldn't enjoy playing this game. Give it a shot. If you hate it, feel free to come back to my comment & yell @ me. With refunds now being a thing, you have nothing to lose. You'll know if you're gonna like it before 2 hours.			",422,71,9,30,34,0,44

												Amazing! This game is mixed with chills, action and a well told story. Any X Files or Supernatural fans out there will most definitely enjoy this game, but if you're just looking for a pick up and play action thriller/horror game, then Alan Wake should be a worthy contender. A must have in my books ;)			",168,12,3,10,5,0,3

												Probably one of the most boring games I had the opportunity to play.The gameplay is utterly boring and repetitive. You can sum it up to running in the woods and fighting endless waves of enemies. These sequeneces are just here to artificially increase the difficulty and the life of the game, for no other reason, and you've basically used all the mechanincs that will be used in the whole game after an hour only.Very poor game design overall. The story keeps you going but it gets completely nonsensical and over mystified.I definitely would not recommend this game, not even on sale.I just fee I spent so much time of my life on such a lame game that I should ask for a lifetime refund!

												Your most powerful weapon will only be the light. And you'll love being in the light, in this game.Enter Bright Falls, enter in the darkness. This game's atmosphere is just fantastic. There's a dark secret behind every corner, into the woods, even in the animals. The darkness takes the lead every minute of this game. Your name is Alan Wake, a famous writer of thriller books, with a little limiting problem: He can't write anymore, not a single word. He goes in a vacation with his wife, Alice, in Bright Falls, where's all apparently calm and quiet. But when the black lady shows up in the cottage they're staying and kidnaps Alan's wife, the horror story Alan used to write become real. And he's the protagonist.Fight against the dark, fight for your wife, fight against yourself.I loved this game minute by minute, and i'd strongly recommend it. 10/10.			",75,32,5,1,7,0,3

Remedy really did a good job with that game, the art, the soundtrack, the voice acting. The game does a good job with narrative as the main character tries to discover what happened to his wife in a what should be a ""holiday trip"" for for his family, he later finds himself in a complete nightmare, the people around him can't be trusted and he must find the truth and solve the mystery.

												I described this game to a friend as the love child of early Max Payne games and movie The Ring. While that's too simplistic of a characterization, it should nevertheless give you a basic idea of how everything plays out. From the outstanding design of the characters, each of which you will develop a connection with, to the simultaneously serene and terrifying portrayal of the Pacific Northwest, this is arguably Remedy's best cinematic gaming experience to date. The only gripe some might have is the combat system, which does take a while to get used to and might frustrate some players in the earlier levels. Stick with it though, as you become more proficient with the controls it will make every hostile encounter and progression through the varied levels an anxiety inducing ordeal in which every bullet, flashlight battery, and any other necessity must be used sparingly to ensure your survival. I have never felt the magnitude of relief and satisfaction this game provides in successfully moving forward in any other title. Follow the light (hah!) and get this game. Quick edit: By the way, this game has the best use of licensed music I've ever seen. Some of the song choices will leave a serious impression on you. So good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   Absolutely worth trying out. The game delivers about 10 hours of gameplay (for me), with the 2 DLC-s, adding 1-1 hour of it. The atmosphere of the game is great, the play with the light is absolutely wonderful.    The combat sometimes can be a little boring, and repetitive, but the story and narrating compensates for it. The 2. and 3. episode was a bit slow, and became boring sometimes for me, but after that, I had not a moment lacking of joy. I liked the storytelling very much, the episodic construction was something I haven't seen in a while, although from this follows, that it's mostly linear, however, I didn't feel the urge to start and go exploring. It was great as it was. You just get sunk in the story, and don't want to stop playing the game.   Apart from everything, a little negativity came from the graphics. The light/dark schemes were awesome, but sometimes there were some sloppy textures, although this isn't really a big problem, since most of the time, it's non-visible.   I'd give the game a total of 8/10 in my opinion, so it's definitely a game you should try out.			",166,22,4,16,13,1,37

The plot is about a writers super-natural force from his unwritten novel hunting him. I have played it through only once and I throughly enjoyed it. This game is like a half-way decent book you may read two or three times in your life. Well worth owning.*As a bonus, the hard copy of the strategy guide reads like a horror novel. It is extremely clever, I suggest anyone who throughly enjoyed Alan Wake to eBay or Amazon themselves a copy of the strategy guide.			",255,17,0,24,24,0,44

The combat system is pretty well balanced enough to make the game somewhat easy and hard at the same time. The difficulty was well balanced and not to frustrating to got through. Enough tries and you'll eventually get it. The story line also had me on the edge the entire time! The cutscenes and explainations to things were so captureing, its kinda like playing a TV show. I recomend this game to pretty much everyone. You won't regret it!			",83,6,0,0,4,0,1

												I am not a fan of horror, but this game scratches an itch very few games do. It scratches a certain itch that usually comes with very well done psychological thriller movies, but it's stronger than that because of the nature of how games work. Being directly involved with the story of Alan Wake really creates a tension unlike any other. The way it uses suspense to create this tension is great, and while there are a few jumpscares in this game, that is not where the horror comes from. You'll find your heart rate beating at the times when you are alone, walking through a forest trail as the fog starts to creep in, politely letting you know that you are no longer safe.The story is also fantastic and the way it pans out at the end will keep you thinking about it for weeks, maybe even years. I originally played this game when it first came out on the Xbox 360, and ever since then I think about this game regularly and recommend it at any chance I get, like now. And after a good few years without playing it I felt the need to go back an experience this once again to truly see if it holds up well now as it does in my memory. It definitely holds up, that is except the facial animations in the cutscenes. Those haven't aged too well, especially with the pixelated, low resolution that they are on. However, what truly makes this game special, the atmosphere, the story, the sense of a journey, and just the general horror of it all... Those have definitely held up. And other than P.T. on the PS4 Store (which uses atmosphere in a similar way, although P.T. is more jumpscare centred than AW), nothing has even came close to replicating this kind of horror game since, which is a shame because I really like this kind of horror, even though I'm not a fan of the overall genre across all mediums, I really hope Alan Wake gets a true sequel some day or at the very least a very good spiritual successor done in the same vein as this game.

We are not talking about Yoda or Mace Windu here. However, something happened a few weeks later.I was looking at game trailers in YouTube and there was this link about Alan Wake the game. It was a gameplay and I played it. It was about Alan Wake who is a writer, who fights against Dark Forces with just pistols, flares and surprise surprise, a TORCHLIGHT, in order to save his wife.Wow, how cool but silly can that be? I became interested. I bought the game cheap and started playing. It is a horror-adventure game to me. The controls are okay but sometimes the camera angles while fighting can be really awkward and disappointing.The game is scary! I had to sometimes lower the volume down a lot just to make sure I'm not mentally distracted but the eerie background sound! Overall, nice game with a 100% satisfaction. It is worth buying if you like horror games.			",48,3,0,17,10,0,11

												Alan Wake is a third-person atmospheric horror game about a not-quite middle-aged writer who wakes up from a car crash while on vacation in a small, bucolic mountain town by a lake and realizes he's lost a much-loved and highly vulnerable family member to an encroaching supernatural darkness spearheaded by a creepy old lady who OH MY GOD WAIT A MINUTE THIS IS SILENT HILL.But it's Silent Hill in the best ways. Rather than copy the Bosch-by-way-of-Jacob's Ladder visual design of the original or the stupid plot beats that got retconned into later games in that series, Alan Wake takes the basic concept—throw a bunch of American horror tropes into a blender, hit 'Frappé', add just enough self-awareness to keep it from being too pretentious—and spins it off into a different story that wears its influences somehow even more firmly on its sleeve. There's plenty of Stephen King here—the guy gets namedropped in the opening seconds—but also some Twin Peaks, Twilight Zone, and even one extremely memorable sequence which probably was the brainchild of a drunken evening playing Left 4 Dead 2.It's got a bit of Silent Hill in the not-so-great ways too—the controls and camera are not quite as clunky as the old 3D ""tank"" controls, but they're close. Sometimes you'll find yourself getting caught up on bits of scenery that didn't actually look like they'd be in the way, and your stamina is just low enough that running from enemies is rarely a viable option. Which is a bummer, because after a certain point it's just not all that much fun to fight off yet another trio of possessed lumberjacks who can hurl a neverending supply of axes pulled from I don't want to know where. Fortunately, upgrades come regularly enough that combat doesn't become too huge a chore for too long and by that point you're either caught up in the story or given up entirely.As for the story, it's doing the Silent Hill this-doesn't-make-sense-but-actually-it-does-because-dream-logic thing, though it does it damned well. Revelations come at a comfortable pace, just quick enough to keep things moving...even if where things are moving to pretty much always involves sticking you in the woods at night.So yeah, I recommend it. Don't know if I'd still recommend it had I paid full price, but fortunately for you Alan Wake's got enough years on it to merit deep cuts during the Winter and Summer sales. Go forth and snag.

												Alan Wake is a superb survival horror game developed by Remedy - the team who made the first two episodes of Max Payne.You play as Alan who's lost his wife under mysterious circumstances - he needs to find out why and how she disappeared and ultimately - of course - save her.I would not call the plot very original, however, there are some twists and also the game feels like a TV show. There are several chapters and when you start the next one you hear narration and the good old ""previously on..."" sentence that really makes you feel as if you were playing an interactive TV show.The gameplay is interesting, too: Alan has an array of weapons such as pistol and shotgun but none of these work until he uses his flashlight to remove the ""shadow"" from his enemies. Only after that can he actually wound the bad guys with these conventional weapons. Ammo is limited and the developers hid several caches throughout the game so it is recommended that you find these. There are other collectibles, of course, just to increase the number of achievements you can attain.Alan Wake is a beautiful game - lighting and the shadows are portrayed realistically and as both are important to the story the developers could not go wrong with them. And they didn't. Voice acting and the music score are also top notch.Too bad the game has too very short DLCs (Signal and Writer) and it has an expansion pack, too, which gives the game some arcade-like features that were completely unnecessary.Overall, I found Alan Wake a unique third person shooter and I can only recommend it to anybody who loves the genre.

												Alan Wake is a game that is easily recommendable, even after all those many years since release. For one the game still looks gorgeous and the dense atmosphere is going to murder you ;)In Alan Wake you are taking on the role of the titular ""hero"". The gameplay consists of you running around in 3rd person, lighting up enemies with your trusty flashlight and then shooting them till they disappear. That's pretty much it. The game is strictly linear, there is no open world, there is little room to explore (but enough in my opinion) and the path is always clear. The gameplay will be the same for the whole duration more or less. You get different guns and stuff, but the core gameplay always revolves around light and darkness and your boomsticks. I just wish you could disable the slow mo camera swings when you avoid an attack. These happen way too frequently. Combat in general is probably also the greatest weakness of Alan Wake, it is pretty repetitive and some people will be bothered by that. However, I think that this is not a game you play because of its great combat mechanics, this is a game you play because of the story and the atmosphere.The game consists of episodes. Each episode can be brute-forced and completed pretty quickly if you don't die. If you take the time to explore, however, you can find secret staches, manuscript pages and other collectibles like TV shows or radio broadcasts. Those are especially worth it. The game just oozes atmosphere and is set up like an episodic thriller that leans heavily on novels, which makes sense, since Alan Wake is a writer. It's dark, it's mysterious and full of surprises and really, really good story telling and voice over. It's rare to find a game that has so much charme. It just feels like the devs were really into this as well. The attention to detail is testament to that. Alan Wake invites you on an emotional, psychological suspense/horror trip, but does not rely on cheap jump scares to make you feel uneasy.What's also great is that you can watch and listen to any cutscenes or cellectibles you've found from the main menu after you've encountered them.If you like great stories and thrillers in particular, pick this one up, as it's absolutely unique.

												Personal Rating: 5 of 10Oh the horror! And I meant the state of the game. Alan Wake is a third person horror adventure game that focus heavily on the story rather than gameplay. However, I personally find it hard to digest the story as the plots are not interesting or anything near spectacular. I do admit it gets to me at first but halfway through the second chapter you have literally seen or have a taste of what the game has to offer 'cept for more dull plots.The gameplay is linear. There are no decisions to make, consequences to face, brain cramping puzzles or even quick time event (yes I am getting desperate here) to give me the jolt of excitement. You traverse through the game via planned and crampped route with enemies to fight from places to places. The weapons are limited with some additional supporting side gears which makes all combat pretty straight forward once you get your strategy right for the first time!Conversations are dull and while it seems the protagonist is in a dire situation he sure doesn't sound like one. The combinations of the above points only makes this game good for a single playthrough but you will need to play it at least twice to unlock all the achievements. However the developers did do a couple of goods to the game such as unannoying soundtrack and effects. Plus they did throw in two additional episodes for free!But all in, Alan Wake is still a decent game that does not deserve a NO. If you are in a mood for a softcore horror game, you can give this a try.			",1029,415,36,151,105,7,188

												A really, really good game. Instead of relying on cheap jumpscares and over-the-top gore, this game takes its scares from the immersive atmosphere, great gameplay and a dark story with a lot of twists and turns. This is how horror games should be. The voice acting is extremely good, graphics seem a little old if looking at faces and up-close textures, but the lightning  manages to deliver the needed mood anyway. In my opinion, this game is great. I've just started it, but I know the twists anyway. Nontheless it fails to chill me! I usually don't play linear games, I always get the feeling your time in the game is filled and you won't be doing much again in it. This is a linear game, but still, one of the best I've ever played!11/10 - Would dive into again!			",120,9,3,13,11,2,3

												...Resident Evil, Twilight Zone, Evil Dead, Creepshow, Silent Hill, The Fog, Stephen King, Twin Peaks... these are all references and similiarities tied to the incredible story involving Alan Wake.  This interesting 3rd person game is a adventure based shooter played mostly in the dark confines of the Pacific Northwest.  There is a lot of fog and forest about, the scenery and visuals are top notch.  On a high end rig this has to look fabulous as on my modest system it looks great.  The sound and voice acting are great as well and includes James McCaffrey from Max Payne fame.  Speaking of Max Payne, Alan Wake is a spinoff from the writer of MP - Sam Lake.  There are a lot of Easter Eggs in this game and tie ins to the media I listed above.  If you like story based adventure games pick this up.  It can be rather slow and controls take some practice, bear in mind this is a more casual laid back game with a few hair raising turns inside awaiting your discovery!			",273,36,11,23,17,1,37

												I have finished episode 1 and I'm about halfway through episode 2; as of now I think the story is pretty cool however there are a few things that I find quite disconcerting:- The camera is absolute garbage, worst pov ever- The dodge mechanic is pants, those bloody things beat the crap out of me 7-8 times out of 10- Sometimes I got so much ammo it's coming out of my ears and other times I'm completely starved thus I can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥as you can't really escape from the mobs since the sprint is limited- The combat system is repetitive (flashlight, shoot, rinse and repeat)and I find myself always fighting pretty much the same type of mobs: small ones, big dude with double health and the boss guy zowing and sprinting around me.I am certainly NOT going to get the dlc. The story is awesome and the graphics are really beautiful but the combat unfortunately is atrocious ._.'			",52,16,0,5,2,0,1

												Alan wake is a very nice horror game adventure type game. I don't wanna get into details too much and ruin the story. You play as the Famous Author Alan Wake. He decides that he needs time away from being bothered by many of his rampant fans. Him and his wife go to a small town called Brightsprings where they plan to vacation at. Throughout the game Alan starts to notice things are going strange thoughout their trip. If you have a decent computer that can handle the beautiful graphics and you are looking for a horror/adventure game I recommend you take a look at Alan Wake when it goes on sale. Personally in my opinion after playing through the game, I rate it 4.3/5 because the game has a interesting story line along with beautiful graphics and combat, however the game does not attract me to play it over again for a long time.

												Alan Wake is a third-person atmospheric horror game about a not-quite middle-aged writer who wakes up from a car crash while on vacation in a small, bucolic mountain town by a lake and realizes he's lost a much-loved and highly vulnerable family member to an encroaching supernatural darkness spearheaded by a creepy old lady who OH MY GOD WAIT A MINUTE THIS IS SILENT HILL.But it's Silent Hill in the best ways. Rather than copy the Bosch-by-way-of-Jacob's Ladder visual design of the original or the stupid plot beats that got retconned into later games in that series, Alan Wake takes the basic concept—throw a bunch of American horror tropes into a blender, hit 'Frappé', add just enough self-awareness to keep it from being too pretentious—and spins it off into a different story that wears its influences somehow even more firmly on its sleeve. There's plenty of Stephen King here—the guy gets namedropped in the opening seconds—but also some Twin Peaks, Twilight Zone, and even one extremely memorable sequence which probably was the brainchild of a drunken evening playing Left 4 Dead 2.It's got a bit of Silent Hill in the not-so-great ways too—the controls and camera are not quite as clunky as the old 3D ""tank"" controls, but they're close. Sometimes you'll find yourself getting caught up on bits of scenery that didn't actually look like they'd be in the way, and your stamina is just low enough that running from enemies is rarely a viable option. Which is a bummer, because after a certain point it's just not all that much fun to fight off yet another trio of possessed lumberjacks who can hurl a neverending supply of axes pulled from I don't want to know where. Fortunately, upgrades come regularly enough that combat doesn't become too huge a chore for too long and by that point you're either caught up in the story or given up entirely.As for the story, it's doing the Silent Hill this-doesn't-make-sense-but-actually-it-does-because-dream-logic thing, though it does it damned well. Revelations come at a comfortable pace, just quick enough to keep things moving...even if where things are moving to pretty much always involves sticking you in the woods at night.So yeah, I recommend it. Don't know if I'd still recommend it had I paid full price, but fortunately for you Alan Wake's got enough years on it to merit deep cuts during the Winter and Summer sales. Go forth and snag.

We are not talking about Yoda or Mace Windu here. However, something happened a few weeks later.I was looking at game trailers in YouTube and there was this link about Alan Wake the game. It was a gameplay and I played it. It was about Alan Wake who is a writer, who fights against Dark Forces with just pistols, flares and surprise surprise, a TORCHLIGHT, in order to save his wife.Wow, how cool but silly can that be? I became interested. I bought the game cheap and started playing. It is a horror-adventure game to me. The controls are okay but sometimes the camera angles while fighting can be really awkward and disappointing.The game is scary! I had to sometimes lower the volume down a lot just to make sure I'm not mentally distracted but the eerie background sound! Overall, nice game with a 100% satisfaction. It is worth buying if you like horror games.			",48,3,0,17,10,0,11

The combat system is pretty well balanced enough to make the game somewhat easy and hard at the same time. The difficulty was well balanced and not to frustrating to got through. Enough tries and you'll eventually get it. The story line also had me on the edge the entire time! The cutscenes and explainations to things were so captureing, its kinda like playing a TV show. I recomend this game to pretty much everyone. You won't regret it!			",83,6,0,0,4,0,1

The plot is about a writers super-natural force from his unwritten novel hunting him. I have played it through only once and I throughly enjoyed it. This game is like a half-way decent book you may read two or three times in your life. Well worth owning.*As a bonus, the hard copy of the strategy guide reads like a horror novel. It is extremely clever, I suggest anyone who throughly enjoyed Alan Wake to eBay or Amazon themselves a copy of the strategy guide.			",255,17,0,24,24,0,44

												Beneath everything I'm about to say, there is still a solid game. However, the flaws seriously detract from the game's enjoyability and replayability. As far as narratives go, Alan Wake is unlike other games. The story is actually a coherent strong story with most the plot threads tied up at the end. The cutscenes feel like a movie.Unfortunatley, the game is technically unimpressive. The voice acting is all over the place, the animations are poor, and the facial animations are downright disturbing. The next problem is that survival horror is based on resource scarcity and isolation. Alan Wake has neither. Ammo is everywhere. I consistently had too many batteries and bullets. There was never a tense moment of combat because I had too many supplies. Boxes full of unlimited ammo are left everywhere. If the combat in this horror game isn't scary, that leaves the isolated setting. Unfortunatley, Alan Wake fails here as well because for the first 3 chapters Alan narrates everything he sees. The player is never alone, its like a podcast is constantly playing in the background. Additionally, the camera always snaps directly onto enemies when they appear, defeating any chance of a jump scare or rising tension.The combat is not very good despite being the star of the game. There's a tiny handful of weapons and a smaller number of enemy types. You can only fight the same enemies with the same weapons for so long before it gets horribly boring. Alan Wake is 8 hours long and the vast majority of your time is spent in the gun play. Enemies only use melee weapons, sometimes thrown. Since Alan has a gun, all he has to do is prioritize based on size and distance. Even on Nightmare difficulty, the combat is tedious. Additionally, some areas have traps. Unfortunatley, these traps glow like the sun and often have no enemies to guard them. Poor combat variety all around for a combat oriented game. The next problem is that although there's a good story buried here, 2/6 chapters are entirely Red Herrings that do not serve to move the plot along, but do serve to extend the game. Alan Wake is about 8 hours long, but it feels like 12. The pacing is horrifically slow due entirely to lengthy hiking missions and endless combat that fails to frighten. Additionally, the story itself suffers from the game's premise. In the game you collect scraps of paper that foretell the future in graphic detail. The problem is this means you'll never be surprised, especially since the most revealing papers are collected mid-way through the quest. It ruins the pacing and suspense when you already know what's going to happen next. It surprised me how something with so much promise could be shrouded by the darkness of mechanical failure.

												The best horror game I have played since Amnesia. The game is a third person shooter that takes place mainly in the forest and follows the trends of a horror book. The game is influenced heavily by Steven King and even makes references to him from time to time. The story is about this man Alan Wake, a famous writer who can't seem to write another page. Him and his wife go on vacation and she tries to get him to write again, immediately after his wife disappears and everything turns all strange and monsters start coming. The game is about 8-10 hours long with no multiplayer but two DLC that you had to pay for on Xbox but we get right away for free. The graphics in the game are pretty good and is pretty optimized. The developer did a very good job porting this game to PC. One of my favourite things in this game is the attention to detail with the collectibles. One of the things you can do is watch episodes of a fictional show in the universe that is similar to the episodes of The Twilight Zone. The detail is great and I personally sat through each of the episodes that I found and enjoyed each one. Another great collectible that the game had was manuscript for Alan's work. The writing is fantastic and was an extremely rewarding collectible so I strongly recommend that you explore these great environments to find each one. The light mechanics in Alan Wake are really well done and the system that makes the game feel like a television series is excellent. Each chapter is treated like a new episode to a TV show that you tune in to watch every week even with the ""Previously On Alan Wake"" section at the beginning. I can't wait for a sequel to this game and I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an excellent storyline in a thriller/adventure game. 90/100			",646,136,23,81,50,5,98

												Alan Wake is an Action Adventure game set in 2009’s Bright Falls.You're Alan, a famous writer that sadly, hasn't been able to write a single line in two years. You were convinced by your wife to go to Bright Falls, hoping that a change of scenery could help you with your block. However, something happened to both of you on your arrival; Missing a whole week and armed with a gun and a lantern, you set on a quest to find your missing wife and your missing memories.Despite of Alan’s constant affirmations, this is not a horror story, it’s closer to an episodic action game with suspense elements. One, with an intriguing story, that sadly left many unanswered questions, hopefully, Alan’s bloke is gone and we can see what he writes next, right, Remedy?★★★☆☆ | It was OK ",1106,403,22,130,65,14,117

												Very very very good port. One of the best ones out there.The video settings are as follows:Graphic QualityAntialiasingFXAA QualityAntisotropic FilteringShadow QualitySSAO QualityBackdrop QualityGodray QualityVolumetric Light QualityDraw DistanceNeed I say more? The game is gorgeous.In general, the original engine created by Remedy which is supported by the Havoc engine is pretty neat. The physics is worked out, the lighting is vibrant, the distant fog is pretty volumetric, the textures are smooth and realistic although the face characters and face expressions can get quite silly and not fully be fleshed out.As for the gameplay, well, I am finally able to easily avoid getting hit in the head with hammers, axes, crowbars and other similar household items. I am able to do so because I can finally evade successfully, something that I was not able to fully master on a controller, which is not the fault of the controller but my own. The taken (your foes) are still able to outrun you and surround you constantly so the game constantly forces you to fight back with vigor. You cannot jump high, which is realistic and you get tired faster than in any other game. Three hits to the head on Hard mode and you are dead. There are no med-kits so you recover health by being illuminated by light, any light.Anyway, by this time I assume most people have heard what the game is about so I'll spare further reading. You are a writer who shows signs of his waning ability to write successfully. He decides to go to a resort to attempt to mentally recover however he soon discovers that there is some kind of battle going on between the malevolent and the benevolent forces in the area. Later on, he starts to doubt his sanity and goes on a quest to find out what really is going on. By the end of the game I personally still had no idea what happened. The DLC's did not help to solve the story either. Anyway it's a nice attempt at creating a somewhat vague story on behalf of the developers but I still had no idea wtf happened.The game is filled with Easter eggs, reference to other icons of American pop culture, miscellaneous videos, paradoxes, logical dilemmas, etc.In the end, let us all thank Microsoft for postponing this game for as long as possible for us humble PC folk, so we could buy their xbox instead. My hat goes off to those who resisted and waited.Now for that Red Dead Redemption game....			",373,36,1,24,8,2,38

 To find the light you must dive into the darkness Alan Wake has been delivered to us in 2010 and still manages to be a pearl in an ocean of similar releases.As you embody the best seller writer Alan Wake, you will gradually discover the misteries surrounding Bright Falls, an apparently friendly country town.From the first moments of the game, you will realise how apparences are mere masks that hide the truth.Armed with a flashlight, guns and flares, Alan will become part of this mistery.Alan Wake mixes and perfectly blends various genres: horror, shooter, puzzle, telltale. This mixture is all linked thanks to an involving atmosphere and such a brilliant use of every media aspect (the OST is actually part of the plot, not to mention Poets of the Fall as singers).All the hidden collectibles, references, side-games and achievements enhance and enforce the replayability factor.What I really love of Alan Wake is the complex plot; without getting into details and possible spoilers, I can tell it feels like watching and controlling a very well done adaptation of a great book.The graphic engine helps to get into Bright Falls, even though some motion captures could have been better (not complaining, considering it is a 2010 release).The only small complain (more like a personal opinion) I could make concerns the controls and the camera view: in tight places and among many enemies it can be a bit of a challenge to move around without falling or bumping over an obstacle, but again, it's just a subjective view, and not really affecting that much the gameplay.There is no reason why I should not recommend Alan Wake; every type of gamer can play it with satisfactory results. It's that kind of game you wish could never have an end. ",284,76,9,36,22,3,31

Go here, pick up the keys, return the keys, shoot some bad guys between here and there... repeat. And the special collectible bonus item is a what?? a thermos. That's right... they've scattered bonus thermos containers around the world for you to collect. If you're even THINKING about buying this game, save yourself some money and rent it first.

												6 out of 10.OK game, story was pretty good.  But gameplay was ""run from here to there"".   Every step of the way you were told what to do, so super linear.  In the end, I HATED the game, I liked the story, but the game frustrated me and I now HATE THIS GAME.  Expansions are stupid too, they add nothing to the story, and are just more of the same frustrating crap.Could be really frustrating at times with just a swarm of enemies, but most of the time they were easily manageable.    If they made it so you had more freedom, and varied what you had to do, it would be a must have.  Graphically it was pretty.I would only pick this up on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just can't take a character driven narrative seriously if you have to shoot your way through a couple of hundred mooks on your way from point A to point B. Unless the character is secretly John Rambo, I just don't see ol' A. Dubbs as capable of something like that regardless of the stakes (or silly in-story explanations) involved. The man writes books, which is about as far away from gun toting monster killer as you can get.Also it would help if Al wasn't one of the least interesting characters in the game. Honestly the high point of the character dialogue comes when Alan's friend Barry shows up. Then it gets a little more tolerable. But quickly goes right back to Alan Wake and his lack of personality.The gameplay is serviceable but nothing spectacular being very similar in style to most survival-horror games of the past and at its core is little more than a series of shooting gallery set pieces.The atmosphere is somewhat more interesting and goes a long way to make you ignore the more questionable aspects of this game.I give this a game the ""One and Done"" seal of disappointment and don't see myself replaying it in the future.You may like it if you are interested in the atmosphere or really like survival-horror style games. But I can't really recommend it.			",228,44,3,52,35,0,28

Only worth it if you can get it at 90% off or more.  The flashlight use is just stupid, and combat gets tedious really quickly.  30 dollars! no way, don't pay more than 3.00 dollars for this game or you will regret it!  Game is pretty much just a straight linear path with cutscenes and horrible combat thrown in.			",72,7,0,2,2,0,1

 A Narrative Horror Story What To Expect From This Game?This game is highly referenced as a book, which itself is divided into chapters. While exploring the detailed, graphical scenery and locations throughout the game, the player will be faced to encounter the darkness of the character's imagination or reality. The darkness iteself will try to consume the player and release spawns of evil lumberjacks to hunt the player thoughout the chapters. While surviving through the hordes of lumberjacks and dodging the darkness, there are several collectables to obtain throughout the game.What Are The Pros Of This Game?  Great Graphics (Environment, Scenery, Characters)  Good Story/Plot  Good Soundtrack  Day/Night Cycles  Nature/Ambience  Good Voice ActingWhat Are The Cons Of This Game?  Repetitive Gameplay  Poor AI  Bad Controls (Character Movement)  Poor Horror Aspects (No Thrillers or Scares)  Linear Level Designs  Limited Items & EnemiesWould You Recommend This Game?No, I do not. This game has a lot of potential to be a good Horror game, but does not deliver. I enjoyed the scenic visuals, the detailed character and object designs, but it was ruined by the linear level layouts that did not enable the player to explore the world itself. While playing this game, it was hard not to compare similarities of the story or characters to another game such as ""Silent Hill."" Although the game has superior graphics than most ""Silent Hill"" titles, this game lacks of the mystery, puzzles and horror. The repetitive gameplay and objectives is the decisive factor for not recommending this game. **(This game needs help from the ""Modding Community"", to make it more enjoyable and scary.) Is It Real Or A Fantasy???  ",78,9,0,10,2,1,6

												This game was a disappointment. For some reason, I thought it was some creepy mystery game. It's actually just a third person action-shooter, and not a good one. I mean, you fight the badguys with a flashlight that doesn't work like a flashlight should; focusing the lens uses more power, but your flashlight auto-recharges when you're not, spare batteries are just an instant recharge.

												This game was a disappointment. For some reason, I thought it was some creepy mystery game. It's actually just a third person action-shooter, and not a good one. I mean, you fight the badguys with a flashlight that doesn't work like a flashlight should; focusing the lens uses more power, but your flashlight auto-recharges when you're not, spare batteries are just an instant recharge. The plot was kinda lame to. It felt like the developers tried really hard to have a deep story, but didn't really make it.			",42,23,0,14,3,0,8

												Help not-Stephen King, who loses his weapon every time a light breeze whistles past, run through endless fields of molasses, as you slowly die to literally every possible threat in the world.  Edit: This just in, I literally lost my weapons BY CALMLY GETTING INTO A PICK-UP TRUCKThe writing itself is certainly a step above most anything else you are going to find, but the plot and the various occurrences that make it up seem created by a 12-year-old who does not know how people actually react to things. ""Hmm, town full of suspicious and sinister supernatural goings-on where you can trust no-one? Of COURSE I will meet with this mysterious stranger and drink whatever she offers me.""Maybe this is all going to be a dream at the end (I am only half-way through) but ugh. For as much as I am a little dubious of the Telltale Games model of adventure gaming, that certainly beats this particular implementation of action and horror. So much potential wasted. Guess this is why there was not a sequel.			",294,79,2,52,17,2,13

												The game is like an interactive movie - running through scripted, pipe like maps. Don't expect any open world experience.My biggest complain is about game controller support. This game doesn't support DirectInput (my Logitech Rumblepad 2). Only XInput is supported which means you need to have ""Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller for Windows""?! Not very nice surprise for me! This is the kind of game I'd like to play sitting on a couch, watching the game from TV and running around with the pad.If you can handle the controller restriction and enjoy interactive movie like games, maybe it's worth a try. I won't comment the game theme and plot - it's up to you if you like it or not. I will give this game not recommended purely because I'm so dissapointed about the game controller support. I don't like this kind of development that you need to buy a new controller only because Microsoft wants so...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By the end of Alan Wake, I really enjoyed it. --  No, seriously, it's very good.  --  I have to warn you though, Episode 1 was very difficult for me to get through.  But, once I got to Episode 2, I had a good time with the rest of the game.Alan Wake isn't an adventure game, yet it has some adventure elements.Alan Wake isn't a shooter, yet it has a lot of those elements as well.Alan Wake isn't a mystery story, yet, there's some sleuthing during the game.Alan Wake isn't a horror story, but there are a few good scares.Alan Wake isn't a melodrama, but Episode 1 has some of that.It's a melange of all five of those genres and probably some others as well.Most of the characters are entertaining/interesting (there are a couple of stereotypes which are bleh, but they're fairly rare).The setting is pretty cool and looks good on my system except for a few low-resolution textures on unimportant things.Sound and music were both top notch.My only complaint is that the ""combat"" is awkward until you learn what's going on. And, sometimes even then, it can be difficult to figure out when to run or when to fight. On a funny note, they must have received funding from Verizon and Energizer, because there are a number of product shots in the latter half of the game.			",73,8,0,10,6,0,30

												I really thought I was going to play this game and love it, but it's disappointingly bad. Especially after looking at all the high ratings it has pretty much everywhere. I'm not even done with ""Episode 2"" and I'm thinking about putting it down for good.First of all the combat feels awful. If you need to create distance between you and some shadow things, you can't outrun them even at a full ♥♥♥♥ing sprint, so I have to wonder why there's an option to sprint at all, because you'll turn around and they'll be right on your♥♥♥♥♥waiting to take a swing. This makes fighting more than one mob a headache-inducing experience because the only way to make distance is to backpedal and shine your light, hoping nothing comes up from behind or you don't have your back to a cliff. Alan can't seem to load his weapon and run at the same time even in life threatening situations, which adds to the clunky feel of combat all the more.Doing something as simple as exploring is tedious because every time you think about looking for some scraps of paper or coffee you're thinking how annoying it will be to deal with those shadow people that will undoubtedly ambush you 10 times while you're searching. Part of the fun I have with games like this is the exploration and getting a chance to look at the atmosphere, but maybe that's just me. But no huge loss, I wasn't really reading those papers anyway, because some of them are only available on nightmare difficulty, so it feels ultimately pointless because you're not going to collect them all the first time through anyway.""Boss"" fights are a cake walk, especially after having to deal with being swarmed every time you take 2 steps in the woods. The boss doesn't really make you feel threatened or limited because there always seems to be a huge crate full of seemingly endless ammo refills sitting around, which you can pretty much stand next to and take a breather because the bosses don't do anything special other than teleport around and make themselves easy targets.The game feels the need to start a new chapter(or ""Episode"") with ""PREVIOUSLY ON ALAN WAKE..."" as if you were watching the new episode of a TV series, even if you just finished the last chapter and started the new one without delay. Oh yes, I really needed a refresher on that thing I spent the past 30 minutes doing. Thank you, that was necessary. Couple that with ridiculously bad typos I've found while bothering to read all of the signs I come across and I feel like I would be embarrased to have to admit I was a writer for this game.Finally, you can't at all identify with dear Alan. He's just kind of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""celebrity"" special snowflake who acts like everyone around him is a nuisance, including his wife, so it's really hard to care what happens to either of them. I genuinely have no drive to finish this game.It's just bad.			",23,4,0,3,2,0,0

												Well, I got this game on sale, of course, because that's how you use Steam. I was pretty excited to play this weird psychological thriller about a guy trapped in his own book or something, but that's all I know about the story, since I didn't get too far in before I got tired of the whole thing.The thing is, I want to enjoy this game, but it's hard to bring myself to do so. The gameplay seems straightforward enough, the story's pretty interesting from what I've seen of it, plus I like weird things. I wouldn't mind seeing a little more of the characters in the little town, but maybe I didn't play long enough to get sick of them, I don't know if that's a common complaint or not. Maybe I'll just settle for a Let's Play or something, because a lot of my complaints are with the actual gameplay.I understand it's like survival horror, you have limited supplies and the better strategy is to pick flight over fight if you can instead of mowing everything down. You can aim, but not really. You only seem to aim at the same time you're using your flashlight, and that drains its battery, so you're going to end up in situations where you're wasting it on an enemy who's already lost their darkness shield or whatever while you're just trying to shoot them. Meanwhile, you can't see what's right next to you while doing so and that ends up in a close enemy taking off half your health, probably. Sure, you can dodge, but you're likely to just dodge into another enemy who hits you as soon as you get out of the dodge. I also understand you're not a super soldier so your combat capabilities are limited. Still, if the game managed to control a little bit better, it'd be a lot more playable. If it decided on being either an action shooter or a survival horror more solidly, too, then maybe the controls would be a little more focused as well.I'll also state I've tried this game on both Normal and Easy with the mouse/keyboard and controller, respectively. Somehow, I managed to get further on Normal with the supposed inferior mouse/keyboard setup than on Easy with the controller, yet I ran into the same problems in both playthroughs. You'd think things would be a lot smoother combining the easiest mode with the best controls. Apparently not. Or maybe I'm just really bad at games, I don't know, but I know I've beaten quite a few, so it can't be entirely that, right?If you get into the nitpicking, I found it hard to run this several year old game with a good framerate without turning down all of the settings most of the way. I'll admit that I'm not running any super machines here, but it seems a little not optimized. I got the framerate to be playable, though, at least, just not 30/60 FPS or whatever. Also, there's bits of product placement here and there, but I can look past that. Same goes for the weird pre-rendered but in-engine(?) cutscenes with awkward animations. It's also easy to get lost, but not in the best way. You don't have much of a minimap to go by, but really, it's a horror situation, you're supposed to feel lost. I've played other games with those problems before, but it's really the controls and the game not knowing what it wants to be other than what it'd be good at that gets to me.Bottom line is if you're into small-town personal psychological horror stories but can tolerate not very good controls and sort of indecisive gameplay, and are also probably a better game player than I am, maybe get this for under $5. If not, then... maybe not. Funny thing is, I somehow prefer the original Deadly Premonition with its tank controls, abundant QTEs, and other imperfections, and I even have trouble playing that for extended periods sometimes.

												I've tried to find some horror games for the Halloween season. I saw all the good reviews of this and I thought, okay. I'll give it a go. Unfortunately, the only horror I found here was in realizing that while waiting for this game to do something scary or thrilling I had played passed the two-hour refund limit, by 30 minutes.The good: •	The environment and atmosphere is pretty good. It has a small logging town feel to it all. The forest paths were even kind of spooky for a second. The bad:•	The gameplay becomes boring fast. Pretty much the same thing over and over again.•	The voice acting isn’t great.•	It isn't a very interesting game. The monotonous narration and the meh writing doesn’t leave much for me to enjoy.•	Some of the moments that were supposed to be scary were just kind of laughably unscary or down right boring.I started to think that maybe people liked the game ironically? Like they do with bad movies. But this game isn’t campy enough for that, and the fact people seem to defend this game to the hilt kind of says otherwise.I left the game without feeling any thrills or sense of dread, which means it is has been a waste of money for me. I’ll play it through and hope that somewhere in this there is some scrap of spookiness.			",130,11,0,14,5,1,14

												Well that was crap. Yes its been years since this game came out, and almost as long since I purchased it, however I finally got around to playing it was and was disappointed. Saying played it might be a strech - I managed to make it part way through the second chapter. Yes I'm not a fan of horror style games, but the continual cut scenes break any form of suspense that has been created. The pedestrian and linear nature of the ""levels"" scream out what is going to happen well before it does. Originally I purchased it because of the references made to it being created by those involved in the Max Payne and Max Payne 2 games. I was expecting something similar - a loving mix of violence, combat and story telling that all meshed together without detracting for each individual element sadly this doesnt come close to those games.

												This game gripped me from the start and didn't let go untill the end. The story and writing is top notch, and coupled with jaw dropping visuals and sound creates a fantastic atmosphere  unmatched since the original Silent Hill, and the Gamecube Resident Evil remake, in my opinion. Infact Alan Wake has clearly been inspired by Silent Hill and many other classic horror games and films over the years, including The Shining, Twin Peaks and John Carpenters 'In the Mouth of Madness'.This is now one of my all time favourite games. It plays very well, very smooth and the attention to detail and overall polish makes it a true AAA PC title. I totally recommend it :)PS. I recommend playing it with max FOV, no HUD, and at night...!			",901,311,69,118,127,7,188

												While this is a well made game, it is not really a good game. Honestly I started off loving it, it played well, had an interesting concept, and sports a great horror/ suspense atmosphere. Then I fought a possessed bulldozer and killed it with a flashlight. That's not a joke, it happens. Really that wasn't what turned me off to the game but it needed to be mentioned. The characters quickly turn from mildly interesting to incredibly dull, the story begins to stretch so thin you can see through it, and the whole experience becomes flat out boring. I've yet to finish the game because there is nothing driving me to do so. I honestly don't care what happens to Alan or anyone else in the world. My guess is the game ends with a PSA for Ambien offering Alan Wake as a safer alternative. The name 'Alan Wake' now carries the weight of ten billion suns as irony to me.			",323,82,2,52,22,3,35

												* Nice scenery* Mediocre story* Terrible game-play on PCI will have to give this a Thumbs Down due to the game-play, which is an over the shoulder FPS. Technically, it's not an FPS, because you are placed in the awkward position of having a third-person point of view, so it's a TPS. All you do is kill vaporous attackers with a flashlight/gun combo. All the developers do is crank up the number of mobs who attack and give you less ammunition and batteries to keep in the fight. Then there is some story, and you pick more batteries and ammunition and do it all over again. It's all on rails and quite linear, so you can't do much about it.The scenery is good. The story isn't all that good. Don't bother with this one.			",36,6,1,8,17,0,2

												Visuals were great for the time and the story is typical pulp horror, but terrible gameplay and gratuitous product placement makes Alan Wake unplayable for me.If you're into heavily story driven casual games (loads of cutscenes, simple gameplay), then you'll probably enjoy this title.

												This game is pretty good.Play it first on the Xbox, then pickup the PC version just to see how much of a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥it is on Xbox. However, my only gripe is that since it's an Xbox port, there is one serious problem. When I press A to strafe left, it works fine, when I press D to strafe right, I go right, but when i press A and D together, I should be able to go both left and right, but I can't, my character just remains stationary. Xbox players cannot do this, though, because the analog stick only goes left or right, not both, so they are peasants and have to make everybody suffer. Good game though.			",439,104,12,38,31,2,41

												This game is like a roller coaster ride of horror movie with a bit of your participation/actions in the game. The actions/fights are simple and a bit repetitive, but the story was interesting enough for me to keep going as if I was reading a mystery novel. The game is broken down 6 episodes like a TV drama. It even has a recap of previous story at the beginning of new episode. I'd recommend this game if you like a mystery storyline with a simple adventure game. It's short and easy with a controller.

												Just finished the game on Normal as I couldn't play it on Nightmare as you have to beat Normal first and here are my thoughts.I saw that this game had very positive reviews but for me this game wasn't that good. I don't know if I had to high expectations when I played it or what.The story for me was a mess and was cut up in a weird order.It was first when I got to episode 5 that I actually started to enjoy the game. Story was getting good and the gameplay were more fluent.There is so many stop and goes in this game it didn't feel fluently for me. So easy to not stand correctly to press buttons and things.Controls felt very slow to respond at times so the combat felt bad.Well for me this game wasn't enjoyable until episode 5 and that is way to late for me to be able to recommend this game.It just wasn't a game I could enjoy.

												Alan Wake is an episodic, third person shooter with traces of psychological horror elements at times. I like this game a lot. The episodic format makes it easy to take breaks between play sessions (each ""episode"" even starts with a ""...previously, on Alan Wake""). The graphics are verry pretty and looks like the team really put time and effort in porting the game. Same can be said for the sound effects and the music.Gameplay wise, it's a TPS with an interesting mechanic - the enemies are defeted by first shining a light on them (Alan is using a battery powered flashlight), destroying the ""darkness"" surrounding the enemies and only after that you are able to shoot and destroy them.The part I enjoyed the most was the story - it feels like an actual TV show, but with a great plot and plot twists. It can take a bit of time to chew through all the info you are presented with at times but it all makes sense and leaves you longing for more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I might be in the minority when I say this but I really didn't like this game. First off I didn't really know what to expect when I purchased this title on sale only that it had nice atmospheric graphics and good reviews. I thought it was going to be a survival horror type game but I was sadly dissapointed. What kind of game is it? I have no clue. I think what the developers were trying to aim for was a ""Indigo Prophecy""/""Heavy Rain"" experience but falls short in terms of story and character development. You play as Alan Wake who's a reporter on vacation with his wife and she goes missing. He tries to hunt down her kidnapper while strange things occur in the small town. Sounds like a promising start but there are a few problems. The main character narrates the events happening around him and how he feels as if he was reading from one of his novels. The way the story is told feels artificial and poorly written as if you were reading a short story from a kid in high school. Constantly having to hear what he's thinking plus reading the ""manuscript"" pages he finds which explains things we've already seen gets really annoying. It also sounds like a cliche plot which ends up having you think the whole thing he's going through is fabricated in his crazy mind.The characters don't have well...any character. They're so hollow. Your wife goes missing, so what? I only knew her in the game for like 10 mins. The main guy Alan Wake has the dumbest robotic look on his face and his voice sounds whiny. The other NPCs have about 2 or 3 lines and when the town goes crazy with paranormal events you don't really care about what happens to them.Gameplay is just as bad. You walk around, talk to people then nightmare world. In nightmare world shadow figures chase you. You shine a flashlight in their face then shoot them when their defenses are down. Rinse and repeat. The combat (if you can call it that) is robotic as Alan Wake's face and not very exciting after the second encounter. Don't get me started on Alan Wake's cardio. I think the writers forgot to explain in the game how he smokes 10 packs a day as he can't run for more then 3 seconds before getting gassed.With the amount of detail and graphics they have in the game engine it could've been a really nice title had they aimed for better gameplay as in Silent Hill. Made it scary and really mess with your senses putting you in constant fear of what's in the dark forest. Or made a story rich games with likeable or even relatable characters like Indigo Prophecy. But instead, this isn't an adventure game, not a survival horror, not scary, not exciting. I don't even know what I paid 5 bucks for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. One time I had 12 revolver ammo VS 5 taken plus a big lumberjack (near the Bear Crossing sign before reaching Lover's Peak). Literally had no way to kill them once I ran out of ammo and no place to backtrack and resup. Had to jump on a ledge and bug out the AI to get past that point. Combat is both frustrating and repetative. Maybe the game has a good story, but so far the plot is not outstanding.			",80,18,0,9,4,0,8

												Incredibly simple combat, and a HUGE emphasis on collectibles. It's suppose to be a horror game, but it wants you to collect hundreds of coffee cups and book pages, and pointless other collectibles. If you avoid all collectibles, this game will only take you maybe 7 hours. Otherwise, you will aimlessly wander areas far longer than you should, which artificially makes the game longer.

												#1: Game says I don't meet the minimum requirements. How a 3.5ghtz dual core doesn't meet the minimum requirements of a 2ghtz dual core... I don't know. Combined with a Geforce GTX 560Ti, I shouldn't have had problems.#2: The characters look like absolute crap when they talk or move, like someone's first GMod animation on Youtube.#3: I hate narration being used as a tool to prod the story and this game is practically bursting with the stuff. You pick up items that the game seriously wants you to read in an investigation mindset and the character kicks on some kind of ""I AM AN ACTOR!"" voice for it. So I don't read them. Put the game trailer on loop and you'll feel what I feel.#4: Why is this presented in episodes? WHY ARE THERE EPISODE RECAPS!?? I WAS JUST THERE, I WAS PLAYING THIS GAME A MINUTE AGO. You're wrecking immersion thinking it gets you some sort of style points.#5: I was a night security guard and expected to get some thrill out of the darkness, but I was rather more annoyed by the 'burst' flashlight gimmick when you get 3-5 enemies. Replacing a battery doesn't actually give you full charge, it gives you a boosted recharge w/o a delay. Batteries are given like candy but not that useful... and yet you can reload a gun and a flashlight at the same time during combat.#6: The achievements want you to find manuscripts, coffee thermoses, and hidden caches of items. There are traps that have the same 'glimmer' visual effect as the manuscripts. Exploring in the dark, you're often constantly attacked, and the paths aren't very obvious. After the first couple of hidden cache's in the first episode, you get start getting attacked in every dead-end hidden cache area... and usually by a large mob. I mean, ""Thanks for these 2 flares and couple of bullets, I've got to spend them all on this trap I walked into to get the next percent of this achievment."" What's the point? Just padding out the game time.#7: Seems that every cut scene, your character blacks out and looses all his equipment. Have to start from scratch and get a new, weak flashlight and gun. After the 3rd-4th time, Wake should consider looting a pistol holster or something. This fills me with anger because of how much time I spent looking for caches and being frugal with ammo, only to have it taken at the end of the area.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this on a whim; it was on sale and I just thought ""What the heck, why not. Looks pretty cool with great graphics; think I'll give it a whirl.""Oh my lord.The graphics are amazing, but I was lagging to heck as I clumsily spun Mr. Wake this way and that trying to aim through the low frame rate I was getting, even on all medium or low settings. My computer is a decent desktop; I use it for a lot of gaming etc, and Gmod is the only source game/mod that lags on all the top graphics settings, just to give you an idea, yet Alan Wake certainly took a toll on my frame rate omg lol.I think the gameplay might have been a lot less of a challenge without this difficulty, but I did get pretty far into the game. I'd definately recommend this just because it looks so great, but the gameplay mechanics are also very interesting; the player's underpoweredness makes taking on hordes of enemies into, frankly, suicide, while the flashlight, flares, and lamp posts make for an even more interesting experience.Definitely worth a playthrough if your machine has the mad specs to handle the amazing graphics.Like, if you can play skyrim on your pc, this would be a horror game for you :3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I game allows you to drive which is weird since its a horror genre game but they made it in a where you still get scared. overall rating i'd give it a 9.3/10. unfortnately although the game is challenging amazing gameplay and graphics. it still lacks story length and weapons. But to be honest I never chose anything over zombies, but ghosts of darkness is kind off better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7 Things not to do when you are making a video game.1. Dumb collectables. If you are going to make people collect something in a game, give them a reason to do so. Don't make collectables for the sake of making them. It is unimmersive and stupid.2. Bad voice acting. You can't convince people to take the story seriously if the voice actings for the majority of characters are cringy as hell.3. Inconsistent gameplay. I like many multi-genre games, but this is getting stupid. What is this game even trying to be? Is it an action horror game or third person puzzle platformer? Why are there several jumping puzzles and what do they add to this game?4. Not horrifying horror elements. No, ""Absurd"" does not equal to ""Scary"". Corny lines are not intimidating; they are corny. 5. Arena-styled level design. Don't ever make ""this is obviously an arena, therefore you are going to have a big battle"" type of level in every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ episodes. This is the most ""gamey"" thing you can ever achieve.6. Bad driving mechanics. Here's a general rule: either make a good driving mechanics, or don't make a long driving section if you don't have a good mechanics for it. Cars in this game remind me of MAKO in Mass Effect, and that is not a compliment.7. Walking Simulator gameplay before cutscenes. Why would you force players to follow a slowly moving, crippled npc just to have a cutscene to play afterward? What is the point of this lack of gameplay? Does this achieve anything? Why not just make a cutscene of those characters walking then? At least, that will save players from pressing W for like 20 minutes.Other than these, story is mildly interesting but nothing mind blowing or new. Graphics is mediocre. Gameplay is somewhat satisfying, but dodging mechanics is annoyingly unresponsive.			",65,33,0,9,0,0,4

												7 Things not to do when you are making a video game.1. Dumb collectables. If you are going to make people collect something in a game, give them a reason to do so. Don't make collectables for the sake of making them. It is unimmersive and stupid.2. Bad voice acting. You can't convince people to take the story seriously if the voice actings for the majority of characters are cringy as hell.3. Inconsistent gameplay. I like many multi-genre games, but this is getting stupid. What is this game even trying to be? Is it an action horror game or third person puzzle platformer? Why are there several jumping puzzles and what do they add to this game?4. Not horrifying horror elements. No, ""Absurd"" does not equal to ""Scary"". Corny lines are not intimidating; they are corny. 5. Arena-styled level design. Don't ever make ""this is obviously an arena, therefore you are going to have a big battle"" type of level in every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ episodes. This is the most ""gamey"" thing you can ever achieve.6. Bad driving mechanics. Here's a general rule: either make a good driving mechanics, or don't make a long driving section if you don't have a good mechanics for it. Cars in this game remind me of MAKO in Mass Effect, and that is not a compliment.7. Walking Simulator gameplay before cutscenes. Why would you force players to follow a slowly moving, crippled npc just to have a cutscene to play afterward? What is the point of this lack of gameplay? Does this achieve anything? Why not just make a cutscene of those characters walking then? At least, that will save players from pressing W for like 20 minutes.Other than these, story is mildly interesting but nothing mind blowing or new. Graphics is mediocre. Gameplay is somewhat satisfying, but dodging mechanics is annoyingly unresponsive.			",65,33,0,9,0,0,4

												Ohhhhhhh... I dont know from where to start, this game is a horror game with amazing mechanics, I played this game with 360 controller and a mouse and keyboard. although I only played this game for 6 hours, I still enjoyed it a lot. yes the story is short but amazing the idea of light darkness the words alan says its amazing! I game allows you to drive which is weird since its a horror genre game but they made it in a where you still get scared. overall rating i'd give it a 9.3/10. unfortnately although the game is challenging amazing gameplay and graphics. it still lacks story length and weapons. But to be honest I never chose anything over zombies, but ghosts of darkness is kind off better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												#1: Game says I don't meet the minimum requirements. How a 3.5ghtz dual core doesn't meet the minimum requirements of a 2ghtz dual core... I don't know. Combined with a Geforce GTX 560Ti, I shouldn't have had problems.#2: The characters look like absolute crap when they talk or move, like someone's first GMod animation on Youtube.#3: I hate narration being used as a tool to prod the story and this game is practically bursting with the stuff. You pick up items that the game seriously wants you to read in an investigation mindset and the character kicks on some kind of ""I AM AN ACTOR!"" voice for it. So I don't read them. Put the game trailer on loop and you'll feel what I feel.#4: Why is this presented in episodes? WHY ARE THERE EPISODE RECAPS!?? I WAS JUST THERE, I WAS PLAYING THIS GAME A MINUTE AGO. You're wrecking immersion thinking it gets you some sort of style points.#5: I was a night security guard and expected to get some thrill out of the darkness, but I was rather more annoyed by the 'burst' flashlight gimmick when you get 3-5 enemies. Replacing a battery doesn't actually give you full charge, it gives you a boosted recharge w/o a delay. Batteries are given like candy but not that useful... and yet you can reload a gun and a flashlight at the same time during combat.#6: The achievements want you to find manuscripts, coffee thermoses, and hidden caches of items. There are traps that have the same 'glimmer' visual effect as the manuscripts. Exploring in the dark, you're often constantly attacked, and the paths aren't very obvious. After the first couple of hidden cache's in the first episode, you get start getting attacked in every dead-end hidden cache area... and usually by a large mob. I mean, ""Thanks for these 2 flares and couple of bullets, I've got to spend them all on this trap I walked into to get the next percent of this achievment."" What's the point? Just padding out the game time.#7: Seems that every cut scene, your character blacks out and looses all his equipment. Have to start from scratch and get a new, weak flashlight and gun. After the 3rd-4th time, Wake should consider looting a pistol holster or something. This fills me with anger because of how much time I spent looking for caches and being frugal with ammo, only to have it taken at the end of the area.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this on a whim; it was on sale and I just thought ""What the heck, why not. Looks pretty cool with great graphics; think I'll give it a whirl.""Oh my lord.The graphics are amazing, but I was lagging to heck as I clumsily spun Mr. Wake this way and that trying to aim through the low frame rate I was getting, even on all medium or low settings. My computer is a decent desktop; I use it for a lot of gaming etc, and Gmod is the only source game/mod that lags on all the top graphics settings, just to give you an idea, yet Alan Wake certainly took a toll on my frame rate omg lol.I think the gameplay might have been a lot less of a challenge without this difficulty, but I did get pretty far into the game. I'd definately recommend this just because it looks so great, but the gameplay mechanics are also very interesting; the player's underpoweredness makes taking on hordes of enemies into, frankly, suicide, while the flashlight, flares, and lamp posts make for an even more interesting experience.Definitely worth a playthrough if your machine has the mad specs to handle the amazing graphics.Like, if you can play skyrim on your pc, this would be a horror game for you :3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake may be a port from the Xbox 360 release, but it is by no means a bad port. With a good amount of control over graphics options (including FoV), and an easy on-the-fly swap from a controller to the mouse and keyboard, Alan Wake is one of the more notable re-releases on the PC.With it's eerie writing, Alan Wake provides a strange ""WTF is going on"" story that tends to suck up hours as you promise yourself to finish the last portion of ""the episode"" that you are on. This not-really-a-shooter provides for a unique experience all with a strange subliminal message to collect as much coffee as possible.While there are some minor control issues (as there is not a 1:1 input at the moment since Alan Wake himself does actually take time to turn), it still feels quite nice to play overall. Combine this with the lower introductory price tag of $35 along with ""The Signal"" and ""The Writer"" makes this a very valuable addition to your library. It's a great one, reward great ports.

												Starts well, ends well, middle drags along like a tired dogs butt.I assume that any favourable reviews of Alan Wake are largely down to the ending, which is an alright ending, with an awesome tune to accompany the end credits, but which mostly comes as a huge relief. Casting your mind back over the previous 14 hours or so (YMMV), it's easy to see why.The gameplay mechanic of reducing your enemies shield of darkness with a torch, before they can be shot, quickly wears thin and becomes a bit of a one trick pony; sections requiring any form of dexterity from Alan, whose jumping prowess is right up there with CJ from San Andreas, become a lesson in frustration; tedious sections of multple enemies also help to prolong the agony.Graphics? Great. Soundtrack? Fine. Storyline? Sure, whatever but for the love of all that is holy, don't make me play American Nightmare, not if it's more of the same.			",105,26,2,13,8,0,13

												It seems that games today have a heavy focus on immersing the player into the own little world with a focus on action and not story or character development. That can be a good thing and a bad thing, it works in some games the most recent masterpiece that i've played being Starbound, which was an absolute treat. However, sacrificing a good story for mediocre action moments doesn't make a game any better, it actually harms the true potential that the game has to offer. There are some rare exceptions however, some shining lights in a sea of wading darkness where only a select few are chosen to be the beacons of hope for the gaming industry. Alan Wake is one of those beacons that the gaming industry so desperately needs. Alan Wake is a 3rd-person psychological horror thriller with action elements that is heavily story based. Going into this game in the summer of 2011, I didn't know what to expect when first jumping into this game. I had heard that it had been well-recieved and that it had quite the incredible story. I had been playing games that didn't involve much story such as Minecraft or Terraria with my friends. As soon as the opening narration occured I was immediatley hooked in, Matthew Poretta's chilling voice kept me enthralled as I traversed frigid lakes and the dense forest floor. I spent all day at my Xbox 360 wanting more from this game, I just couldn't put the controller down. Now enough about my personal account witht the game and onto the actual review. We'll start with the graphics. The game looks gorgeous. Period. Remedy was able to beautifully capture the mountanious and woodland areas of Northern Washington and was able to make it come to life. There were times when walking through the forest and found myself admiring such a captivating environment and feel to the forest. It's like the forest is actually breathing along with you. With occasional bad textures and the facial modeling and lip syncing not being all that great, they are however, easily overlookable. Next, I will move to Sound. The games sound design is quite a marvel in itself, when I was playing I found myself listening to the sounds of the forest accompanied by Petri Alanko's masterful and captivating score. It truly is one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard in a video game, the man deserves some recognition. Next, onto pacing, story, and character development. The story as I said was absolutley incredible, the cheesy dark vs. light aspect does not cloud some of the games major thematic elements and boy do the writers at Remedy really know how to write a script, because the writing is incredible. The voice cast is solid with Matthew Poretta voicing Alan Wake, however, none of the other voice actors really stand out to me exceot for the legendary James McCafferty voicing Thomas Zane, if you do not know who he is, he voiced Max Payne, and don't worry there are plenty of Max Payne references and other small allusions to other famous horror works as well. The pacing of the story is well and it works because this is a game in which you are supposed to take your time with. All of the little collectables and radio/ TV shows you can watch are just incredible little details put into the game that really make the town of Bright Falls seem more and more sinister throughout. Overall, the game is a work of art that surely isn't for everybody and that is understandable, its clear that it wasn't made for anyone, but anyone who wants to enjoy a well-written and well crafted story should really consider purchasing Alan Wake, with some flaws in the techincal field, such as the terrible climbing mechanic and the wonky AI, they are easily overlookable. The game is also an emotional joyride all the way throughout so be warned. All in all, my final verdict for the game is a 9.5/10.			",129,10,2,11,4,0,2

												This is neither a competent action game, nor a competent horror game. For starters, I found it near impossible to get immersed, due to the really janky animations that put every character well into the ""uncanny valley"", only instead of this making it creepy, it just makes it really hard to look at. And that wouldn't be so much of a problem if it weren't that the game pretty much takes every opertunity to put the worst animations in the spotlight. I mean, I can understand this with in-game animations, but even the pre-rendered cutscenes suffer from this!Past the animations, though, the gameplay can pretty much be summed up by ""walk and occationally point your flashlight at things simulator"". And there was hardly a single death that I felt wasn't just the game working against me. This doesn't get better as the game progresses either, as towards the end it likes throwing as many of the most annoying enemies at you as possible. Why are they annoying? Because pretty much all you do to defeat them is shine your flashlight at them until they disapear, all the while taking unavoidable damage (this is especially true with the birds).All in all, there are a few moments in, say, the third quarter of the game that I actually found enjoyable (one of which is really awesome, but I don't want to spoil it if you do buy it), but trust me, I'm only scratching the surface here on what's wrong with this game. In no world is this worth $30, so if you really want to get it I would say don't spend any more than $5 on it.			",182,23,1,7,8,0,12

												Alan Wake has a nack for pulling you out of any atmosphere it creates weather it's picking up a page from the manuscript or watching a t.v show, you would think that for a game to be based off of a book that the story would be engaging but it is not... I remember when i the game first came out on Xbox i got it but never finished it and now i remember why even with me being older i struggled to set down and play it, but i willed my way through it till the end. Is the game scary...? NO! I laughed more at the bad acting and one liners then i thought i would. but maybe thats what they wanted to go for. on the plus side for being a port it ran great.Intel I7 6700k16 gig Ram (DDR4)EVGA gtx 960 FTW editionFPS 60			",179,56,5,12,17,2,17

												His name is Alan Wake, and he's a writer.  Take control of a man who seemingly lost his love on the eve of their entry to the best part of their lives.  In a setting straight out of a King novel you deal with the supernatural in a Cape Cod town; pointing light sources at shadows who can then be defeated with weapons strewn.  There is alot of spoken dialogue in he game as Wake performs a soliloquy quit often to get his thoughts across in a great narrative with good voice acting.   The music is a farily good movie type score.  All in all there's really nothign wrong with it aside from paying too much. It's a afternoon and a half survivial horror game with a neat story. That being said, if you can get it for $15 you wouldn't have wasted money.			",224,42,3,10,8,2,11

The games sound design is quite a marvel in itself, when I was playing I found myself listening to the sounds of the forest accompanied by Petri Alanko's masterful and captivating score. It truly is one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard in a video game, the man deserves some recognition. Next, onto pacing, story, and character development. The story as I said was absolutley incredible, the cheesy dark vs. light aspect does not cloud some of the games major thematic elements and boy do the writers at Remedy really know how to write a script, because the writing is incredible. The voice cast is solid with Matthew Poretta voicing Alan Wake, however, none of the other voice actors really stand out to me exceot for the legendary James McCafferty voicing Thomas Zane, if you do not know who he is, he voiced Max Payne, and don't worry there are plenty of Max Payne references and other small allusions to other famous horror works as well. The pacing of the story is well and it works because this is a game in which you are supposed to take your time with. All of the little collectables and radio/ TV shows you can watch are just incredible little details put into the game that really make the town of Bright Falls seem more and more sinister throughout. Overall, the game is a work of art that surely isn't for everybody and that is understandable, its clear that it wasn't made for anyone, but anyone who wants to enjoy a well-written and well crafted story should really consider purchasing Alan Wake, with some flaws in the techincal field, such as the terrible climbing mechanic and the wonky AI, they are easily overlookable. The game is also an emotional joyride all the way throughout so be warned. All in all, my final verdict for the game is a 9.5/10.			",129,10,2,11,4,0,2

												This is neither a competent action game, nor a competent horror game. For starters, I found it near impossible to get immersed, due to the really janky animations that put every character well into the ""uncanny valley"", only instead of this making it creepy, it just makes it really hard to look at. And that wouldn't be so much of a problem if it weren't that the game pretty much takes every opertunity to put the worst animations in the spotlight. I mean, I can understand this with in-game animations, but even the pre-rendered cutscenes suffer from this!Past the animations, though, the gameplay can pretty much be summed up by ""walk and occationally point your flashlight at things simulator"". And there was hardly a single death that I felt wasn't just the game working against me. This doesn't get better as the game progresses either, as towards the end it likes throwing as many of the most annoying enemies at you as possible. Why are they annoying? Because pretty much all you do to defeat them is shine your flashlight at them until they disapear, all the while taking unavoidable damage (this is especially true with the birds).All in all, there are a few moments in, say, the third quarter of the game that I actually found enjoyable (one of which is really awesome, but I don't want to spoil it if you do buy it), but trust me, I'm only scratching the surface here on what's wrong with this game. In no world is this worth $30, so if you really want to get it I would say don't spend any more than $5 on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a big fan of games with great storyline & there are just too many loop holes in this game. Some part of the story will make you go ""What the fish?

												the combat is quite boring. the speeches made by the monsters before they attack are so BLAH. the ""suspense"" story is honestly just tiresome.if you are not stoked after watching 10 mins of the gameplay, that means you really should not bother playing this game.FYI if you are really interested in the story, read wiki. and then realise that you have wasted 15 mins of your life trying to make sense of the tiresome story.

												I'm sure people who like this ResEvil type of game will like this one but I found it to be too difficult to be fun. Facing off against 4 or 5 enemies is not scary as much as it is frustrating. It's done very well but the flashlight mechanic being tied to time really limits what you can do. The satisfaction of getting a cool double headshot or a rolling trip or something is totally missing because the flashlight has to burn the enemy before you can shoot them. This makes every kill feel the same and the difficulty spike is juggling more targets and managing resources rather than fun/better gameplay. This would be better if there were more ways to manage my resources or upgrade my weapons (Maybe there are. I'm 5 hours in and haven't seen anything) but I feel like there is only one path to walk on and one way to play each encounter. Backing out of an encounter resets it so I can't really kite and juke or hide and heal. It's all about getting the light on the closest guy, waiting waiting and shooting him before getting the light on the next guy waiting waiting and shooting him. Fail to acquire targets fast enough, focus the wrong target, or fail to wait enough before shooting and you have to start over. If they get anywhere near you, just restart from checkpoint and try to wait faster next time. I would recommend this game at about $8.			",203,53,1,21,6,2,19

												a really nice game with a gameplay similar to alone in the dark , you have to shed light one your enemies then you can shoot them,the graphics are really good ,the plot is original i think (definitely the best part of the game), you have to fight your way and save your wife in some kind of twisted story by a dark presence that was written by Alan Wake the protagonist of this game + the game comes with 2 special episodes like dlcs to fully understand the story and thats cool .didnt face any problem no glitches or bugs except for the camera , sometimes you will have to fight against 5 or more enemies in a small area and the camera doest help ,anything else was perfect.i highly recommend it for alone in the dark fans or gamers that love a good thrilling and horror stories ;)9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really cant say anything bad about this game from start to finish i was glued to the screen and wanted to find every missing book page just to have more story it is that good .

												Alan Wake has a nack for pulling you out of any atmosphere it creates weather it's picking up a page from the manuscript or watching a t.v show, you would think that for a game to be based off of a book that the story would be engaging but it is not... I remember when i the game first came out on Xbox i got it but never finished it and now i remember why even with me being older i struggled to set down and play it, but i willed my way through it till the end. Is the game scary...? NO! I laughed more at the bad acting and one liners then i thought i would. but maybe thats what they wanted to go for. on the plus side for being a port it ran great.Intel I7 6700k16 gig Ram (DDR4)EVGA gtx 960 FTW editionFPS 60			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												His name is Alan Wake, and he's a writer.  Take control of a man who seemingly lost his love on the eve of their entry to the best part of their lives.  In a setting straight out of a King novel you deal with the supernatural in a Cape Cod town; pointing light sources at shadows who can then be defeated with weapons strewn.  There is alot of spoken dialogue in he game as Wake performs a soliloquy quit often to get his thoughts across in a great narrative with good voice acting.   The music is a farily good movie type score.  All in all there's really nothign wrong with it aside from paying too much. It's a afternoon and a half survivial horror game with a neat story. That being said, if you can get it for $15 you wouldn't have wasted money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It seems that games today have a heavy focus on immersing the player into the own little world with a focus on action and not story or character development. That can be a good thing and a bad thing, it works in some games the most recent masterpiece that i've played being Starbound, which was an absolute treat. However, sacrificing a good story for mediocre action moments doesn't make a game any better, it actually harms the true potential that the game has to offer. There are some rare exceptions however, some shining lights in a sea of wading darkness where only a select few are chosen to be the beacons of hope for the gaming industry. Alan Wake is one of those beacons that the gaming industry so desperately needs. Alan Wake is a 3rd-person psychological horror thriller with action elements that is heavily story based. Going into this game in the summer of 2011, I didn't know what to expect when first jumping into this game. I had heard that it had been well-recieved and that it had quite the incredible story. I had been playing games that didn't involve much story such as Minecraft or Terraria with my friends. As soon as the opening narration occured I was immediatley hooked in, Matthew Poretta's chilling voice kept me enthralled as I traversed frigid lakes and the dense forest floor. I spent all day at my Xbox 360 wanting more from this game, I just couldn't put the controller down. Now enough about my personal account witht the game and onto the actual review. We'll start with the graphics. The game looks gorgeous. Period. Remedy was able to beautifully capture the mountanious and woodland areas of Northern Washington and was able to make it come to life. There were times when walking through the forest and found myself admiring such a captivating environment and feel to the forest. It's like the forest is actually breathing along with you. With occasional bad textures and the facial modeling and lip syncing not being all that great, they are however, easily overlookable. Next, I will move to Sound. The games sound design is quite a marvel in itself, when I was playing I found myself listening to the sounds of the forest accompanied by Petri Alanko's masterful and captivating score. It truly is one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard in a video game, the man deserves some recognition. Next, onto pacing, story, and character development. The story as I said was absolutley incredible, the cheesy dark vs. light aspect does not cloud some of the games major thematic elements and boy do the writers at Remedy really know how to write a script, because the writing is incredible. The voice cast is solid with Matthew Poretta voicing Alan Wake, however, none of the other voice actors really stand out to me exceot for the legendary James McCafferty voicing Thomas Zane, if you do not know who he is, he voiced Max Payne, and don't worry there are plenty of Max Payne references and other small allusions to other famous horror works as well.

												""It's Not a Lake, It's an Ocean.""I enjoyed playing this game from beginning to end. Making a game into a television-show like suits this story well. A lot of references to horror classic make me surprise, collecting manuscripts to picture the whole novel and catch the details of the story are fun! As for the element I like best is no doubt - Night Spring, it's my break time during the game when stay to watch a mini television show lol! The ED of each episode is great too, I didn't skip any it's just beautiful!About the game play, because the scenario during battles changes little and the enemies are repetitive, it gets just a little bit dull, but I have to admit that shadow haunting in the forests, sudden change of dark and light, these all suit the depressing and unsettling atmosphere well in the game.About the story, some people critic the ending but I hold the different opinion. Maybe it's not that perfect but I think it's a good end for a psycho-thriller like this.  Alan Wake took the place of Alice and got stuck in the darkness. Rose the fangirl became the new lady of light and Nightingale became the new evil. If Alan Wake creates a new writer to bring the light like Zane, then this story becomes a loop, hmmmm pretty interesting.	And, Remedy did a word trick in 'Alan Wake' like 'Max Payne', again. This never gets old.----------------------------------------------------------------------Special Episode 1 is seriously insane, there is no fun getting killed repeatedly by hordes with little supplies. I can't get it through now it's a torture for me.			",169,33,0,14,2,0,10

												This is a wonderful story-based game.  A good storyline makes a good game.  In this game you play a famous book author, Alan Wake, who starts out his adventure on a vacation.  Things get serious when the characters in his stories come to life in what seems like a nightmare.  Soon, reality isn't what it seems.  This game plays like a cool TV series or playing a good book story.  It has episodes and Alan Wake narrorates his thoughts at times.  It's a horror adventure so there's scary parts.  You have to fight enemies, flip switches and find supplies to survive.  There are several things to find on your adventure like guns, ammo, book pages and flashlight batteries (you'll see why).  In other words the gameplay is like any other survivor-adventure.  But the storyline is real solid and leaves you wanting to find out what happens next.  At the time of this writing, Alan Wake is my #1 favorite story-based game.Pros:+ Storyline+ Game plays like a good book / episode story+ Cut scenes+ Graphics+ Soundtrack+ Voice acting+ Horror adventure+ There's book adaptation to this game:  Alan Wake by Rick Burroughs++BONUS!  Look in your game files for extra content  :)Cons:- No sequel (why?!)- There was a couple of places in the game that was sorta tough when being attacked and not knowing what to do.  It would be easy to replay it but I did have a couple of rage moments first time through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Good and weird story, I bit I found strange but the graphics was so beautiful. :) I really liked it, but some part was a bit ahh c'mon u can't do that, and they kill u. I found a bit stupid in the city ( village or what ) in the woods, they always had gun or something which can help us to survive the dark side attack. I found that a bit weird. But I really liked the story, but as I said same part of the game I didn't was boring, or overdriven. But i give a yes, because I really enjoyed the game, and also that ending was amazing! :) [No spoiler!]:) Hope they going to make Alan Wake 2. Then definitly I buy that game! :) Thanks!

												This game has a great story, although the gameplay is repetetive as hell. Point the flashlight at the enemy, penetrate the armor of darkness and shoot it. They try to vary gameplay, but fails to give immersion gameplay wise. It has some nice moments and the slow-motion killcam is strangely satisfying. If there is another problem there must be the camera wich may end up having you killed because you couldn't see what was happening.Play this for the story, the gameplay and progression is kinda meh.I give it a 7/10			",193,71,2,15,18,4,21

												Alan Wake is a plot-driven thriller that pushes you forward to the end, but the journey to get there is a slow one.  Filled with cutscenes, I found it hard to truly get immersed in this game, becaus whenever I was about to, it was interrupted.  The combat system grows stale after a few hours; the characters, especially Alan, are nearly impossible to empathize with; and overall, I just felt there could have been a lot more done to this game to have made it more interesting until the very end.  Overall, Alan Wake just fails to deliver.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a wonderful story-based game.  A good storyline makes a good game.  In this game you play a famous book author, Alan Wake, who starts out his adventure on a vacation.  Things get serious when the characters in his stories come to life in what seems like a nightmare.  Soon, reality isn't what it seems.  This game plays like a cool TV series or playing a good book story.  It has episodes and Alan Wake narrorates his thoughts at times.  It's a horror adventure so there's scary parts.  You have to fight enemies, flip switches and find supplies to survive.  There are several things to find on your adventure like guns, ammo, book pages and flashlight batteries (you'll see why).  In other words the gameplay is like any other survivor-adventure.  But the storyline is real solid and leaves you wanting to find out what happens next.  At the time of this writing, Alan Wake is my #1 favorite story-based game.Pros:+ Storyline+ Game plays like a good book / episode story+ Cut scenes+ Graphics+ Soundtrack+ Voice acting+ Horror adventure+ There's book adaptation to this game:  Alan Wake by Rick Burroughs++BONUS!  Look in your game files for extra content  :)Cons:- No sequel (why?!)- There was a couple of places in the game that was sorta tough when being attacked and not knowing what to do.  It would be easy to replay it but I did have a couple of rage moments first time through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I learned from this game that omega 3 fatty acids are good for my heart. Then the game reminded me that there are 65 billion pigs and cows in the world. And did you know that the graveyard shift can cause cancer? After taking 2 pills in the morning starting playing this game i was nice and calm all day long. In the evening after playing i took 3 and i slept like a baby. Overall: Stay away from my daughter. Play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love all horror genres. Starting with silent hill and now with Alan Wake. The game takes a really unique perspective withe the main character. You play as Alan, but the game is narrated like a novel. It's very much like a stephen king movie. It's easy to lose yourself in the game. Graphics are pretty nice. Haven't completed the game but i look forwad to replaying it and would definately recommend the buy.			",13,3,0,3,0,0,1

												Alan Wake is one of those strange games that aren't great or horrible that is a bit like a chore to play. It's definitely not a bad game. The mechanics are good, the graphics are solid, the voice acting is passable. But do I recommend it? Meh, you could miss out on it and be just fine but if you are looking for a solid survival horror then it'll do the job until the next Dead Space or Resident Evil.Oddly the story is both the highlight and detriment of the game. It is interesting and well told but sometimes comes off as a bit pretentious. There are a few loose ends and nothing is really explained too well in the DLC epilogue chapters. However I did like how the story tied into combat with light and darkness becoming literal obstacles and commodities along your journey. Unfortunately combat does become repetitous and downright frustrating in several segments. Granted that's why it is Survival Horror and not an Action title. There were plenty of occassions though where enemies were a bit overwhelming. The worst part was dealing with levitating inanimate objects becoming possessed. There is almost no way to avoid incoming attacks leaving you retrying those areas plenty of times screaming ""this is bulls***!"".Insofar at shock value goes, which is an important part of survival horror, there really wasn't too much of that. It wasn't overly violent and there weren't really many cringe worthy scenes. It reminded me of the movie Shadow Falls. Kind of like a horror movie censoring itself down to reach the young teen audience without their parents c***blocking them. All in all it was still a satisfying experience but for not being an upper echelon game I could have enjoyed an experience half as long in the Alan Wake universe. If you have an itch for Survival Horror I'd suggest playing some of the gems you may have missed over the years like Condemned, Dead Space, Evil WIthin, Silen Hill, or any of the Resident Evils. If you played them all then by all means play this as a diversion until the next triple A title gets released.			",300,92,4,22,7,3,15

												Still need to finish this game, but after watching the prequel series on Xbox LIVE (back when that was such a thing to do) called ""Bright Falls"", I found the plot for this game so immersive, and whilst the scares aren't so much jump scares, it's still enough to set you on edge and make you really judge what you're doing in the game.Perfect for those that like a good and (fairly) linear third person shooter, that's story rich and exploratory.

												The main issue is that the gameplay is very repetitive in a boring way that only gets improved in the stand alone expansion, American Nightmare. It also doesn't help that the story is mostly a copy of a movie which was based on a book. Therefore, there's no reason to play if you've been through one of those two already. But because of the boring gameplay, I'd have to not recommend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When the wife of the best-selling writer Alan Wake disappears on their vacation, his search turns up pages from a thriller he doesn’t even remember writing. A Dark Presence stalks the small town of Bright Falls, pushing Wake to the brink of sanity in his fight to unravel the mystery and save his love. Presented in the style of a TV series, Alan Wake features the trademark Remedy storytelling and pulse-pounding action sequences. As players dive deeper and deeper into the mystery, they’ll face overwhelming odds, plot twists, and cliffhangers. It’s only by mastering the Fight With Light combat mechanic that they can stay one step ahead of the darkness that spreads across Bright Falls. With the body of an action game and the mind of a psychological thriller, Alan Wake’s intense atmosphere, deep and multilayered story, and exceptionally tense combat sequences provide players with an entertaining and original gaming experience			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Alan Wake"" is the first of two suspenseful horror games. I haven't finished it yet, but so far I've enjoyed it. It has an interesting concept that really makes you want to know what happens next. My one HUGE complaint is that the keyboard and mouse setup is extremely touchy. There are times when I'm getting attacked in the game and I try to move the camera with my mouse and I end up staring at the sky. It's not helpful in the least. The issue with running away while being chased is the same. Overall, this is more of a mixed review. I've heard this game might be easier with a controller, but since I don't use one, I can't really say if it's true. The series continues with the second and last game titled, ""Alan Wake's American Nightmares"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know, I know it is a bit late to do this.I love this game since i seen it on trailers i knew i have to get it.Controls are a bit unusual but still fast to be learned and easy to use and whole game has a lot of customability as far as the options go. But still there are some missing things.Graphics are great if you consider the release date it still looks great when on maximum details. Be wary some types of machines have trouble running it for whole play thru.Story is great just Fing Awsome even speaking about it would spoil it for you if you did not see trailer and that I doubt.It takes you for spin and even when everything gets explained you might still ask but what about that.Even the DLCs are great and well that comes from a guy that bought it for console and PC in collectors editions.Music is in many games underestimated thing but here it makes its part in story and is breath taking in ocasions.So not to prolong a recap.Hard copy and Online DL versions have a lot of content more than other games.+Controls and graphics are great. +Music made as part of story well fited in each part.+Story is very very well made so you will enjoy it for many replays. ++Only minus is that unupdated gpu drivers and old gpu support is not there so you need at least average PC to run it.-So it gets honest 10 from 10 because you cant have such great game made every day.

												Alan Wake is a movie game. Last time I had such feelings when I finished playing Dreamfall. It's a film that you watch and sometimes participate in, helping the characters on their way. There is a lot of cinematic inclusions in it, the game constantly gives you various hints, indicates what you should do, etc; all the events go their way, and you have no actual influence on them, you are unable to change the plot. In other words, the game commands, and you obey. You are written into this story as tightly as all other characters of it. You are a player, and you are a mere spectator at the same time.Playing it was pleasant and entertaining. I really liked that process of burning the darkness out of those cursed people and bringing them the final rest. A flashlight becomes both a shining sword of light and a laser indicator that makes aiming very easy and intuitive. Actually, you feel incredibly cool when you overcome the enemies that attack you. It's all the more unusual as it's not a super hero that you are playing for; he's just a writer, not very strong, not very well trained, but still having enough guts and stamina to cope with all that hardships he had to face.It's not very long (14 hours in my case), but that's well enough. Each episode is in its place. Would it be longer, some boredom might appear and spoil the fun. It's rather addictive, especially at the beginning, so make sure that you do not lose the track of time. As for the plot, it cannot be called extraordinary, but I find it interesting. Most probably, it was made a bit inconsistent on purpose (well, what consistency do you expect to see in a story where the world goes mad?).To mention the negative side, I guess that the most unpleasant thing here was the product placement and hidden advertising in the game. For example, you need batteries for your flashlight, and not just any batteries, but those of one certain trademark whose distinct design is recognized clearly. I can deal with it, though; people need money to develop games, we all know that.I never wanted to play this game, in fact; I bought it just because it was on 90% discount sale. Now, I recommend it. Not for a moment did it make me regret my choice. It even had an unexpected side effect on me: back in non-distant past I used to write some fiction, and this game brought back my memories of the great fun of being a writer. Maybe, one day I will create a story or two again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Эта игра оправдала все. От ожидания, до цены. Сюжет просто класс. Для тех кто в танке: События «Alan Wake» происходят в вымышленном американском городке Брайт-Фоллс. Главный герой игры, писатель Алан, пытается найти пропавшую жену и сталкивается со сверхъестественной тёмной сущностью, овладевающей городом и его окрестностями по ночам. Находя разрозненные страницы собственной рукописи, он понимает, что его приключения подчиняются сюжету написанного и забытого им романа.Скажу так, игру стоит попробовать. хотя бы ради атмосферы. Думаю небольшой ужастик на ночь не повредит. Особенно с таким сюжетом			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a strange game. Its story is somewhat good, but with really really bad dialogues. You simply don't want to hear them and don't give a flying **** for what people are saying in this game. Most of the time it's all irrelevant for the plot and aren't even funny or entertaining dialogues. You really, REALLY won't care at all, believe me.Aside of this, Alan Wake has one of the most terrible level designs I ever experienced in my life. Most of the time you're on big open useless woods. They look like non linear, but you just follow the roads or some easy visual language signs and you're right on your way. Instead of what it looks like, it is totally linear. All the rest of the scenery are just useless(except from one place or another where you can find some collectables or weapon caches. But they're not even that hard to find...). Not only that but, also, most of the time you will be walking in these useless woods without ANYTHING happening at all. A literal ""walking simulator"", for the most part.Besides, Alan Wake have a ""ok"" gameplay with interesting mechanics. But it's a shame that you'll only see this game shining(ba dum tss) in very few moments. There's one part or another in this game where you'll think something like ""THAT'S what I was expecting from this game!"". It's really a shame that most of the time you will not be thinking this, but will be like ""oh my god, how could be this is a game? I'm only walking and walking"" or ""What a REALLY bad level design!"" or ""This game is SO frustrating! How can they throw me 10 enemies when I'm totally unarmed??"" and things like these...I'm really disappointed with this game. Shame. These guys from remedy gave us the perfectly crafted Max Payne and now it's really hard to believe that they gave us a game like Alan Wake...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A hammy 3rd person horror-ish action game that's a giant bear hug to fans of horror writers like Stephen King, the game itself is not without its charms, but is bogged down by less than stellar gunplay/driving sections and embarrassingly ludicrous writing and dialog. Dated by today's gaming standards in both technical and creative aspects, this one is probably only worth scooping up on sale if you haven't played it in years and want to revisit it.

What I liked: Mystery/Horry Atmosphere is great here Combat despite very basic, is very fun and challenging at times Story is one of the fine examples of great writing in games(Stephen King style)What You Need to Know:  Very cutscene and story heavy game  You pick up manuscripts that help flesh the story and world out( sadly you have to stop to listen and read them)  Game is overall not that hard, very good for those that can't handle alot of difficulty( sadly nightmare isn't available till you already beat it once)  Game does not age well, very plasticy looking models, can ruin the experience if graphics matters so much to you  You get the DLC free!! Played the game on Xbox, getting everything in the game( too lazy to do again)My Score:APrice: $5 Humble BundleCompleted in:8 hours( NO DLC)Games similar:  Amnesia: The Dark Descent ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story is really thoughtful and the main carrying point of the game. Think of it like Gone Home, Finding Ethan Carter, or any other story driven game. You aren't playing the game, more or less you want to watch the movie that is this game. That being said the story is really well integrated into the actual game itself, novel transcripts found throughout the world cleverly explain the story in more depth. SPOILER: The ending is pretty disappointing even with the bonus scenes and everything. The bonus scenes themselves barely explain anything. Although they are VERY INTENSE compared to the normal game in terms of difficulty, they are much crazier in terms of scenery and storytelling and in the end you will feel drained with little to no reward. I'm guessing the rest of the game won't really be finished until Alan Wake 2. The gameplay itself is where this game falls short, it's repetive for the most part and while original, isn't exactly great. It consists of flashing a light in many different ways on an enemy, then shooting them. The aiming isn't exactly precise by any means and the third person shoulder view means it will play kind of like Resident Evil 4...except worse.That being said it's not particuarly difficult outside of a few things, the game itself is carried on the premise of the story like said earlier. The story at times may seem creepy and scary, and there are some jump scares but it's more of a thriller than a horror. The characters are actually very interesting and mold pretty well together, it's a game that's a movie that requires you to think about what it's telling you. If that makes any sense. The graphics despite being a relatively old game, held up extremely well on the PC version, it's actually one of the more impressive games I've seen despite the textures clearly lacking the scenery and details create some impressive visuals. It may not have the sharpness of next gen games, but it really doesn't need it. Also the performance for this game is rock solid, very easy for my PC to run it, very stable no frame dips or stutters despite being as pretty as it is. I was definitely impressed by the graphics of this game even for an old game. If it's $2.50 (the price @ Winter Sale 2014) definitely get it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Эта игра оправдала все. От ожидания, до цены. Сюжет просто класс. Для тех кто в танке: События «Alan Wake» происходят в вымышленном американском городке Брайт-Фоллс. Главный герой игры, писатель Алан, пытается найти пропавшую жену и сталкивается со сверхъестественной тёмной сущностью, овладевающей городом и его окрестностями по ночам. Находя разрозненные страницы собственной рукописи, он понимает, что его приключения подчиняются сюжету написанного и забытого им романа.Скажу так, игру стоит попробовать. хотя бы ради атмосферы. Думаю небольшой ужастик на ночь не повредит. Особенно с таким сюжетом			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a strange game. Its story is somewhat good, but with really really bad dialogues. You simply don't want to hear them and don't give a flying **** for what people are saying in this game. Most of the time it's all irrelevant for the plot and aren't even funny or entertaining dialogues. You really, REALLY won't care at all, believe me.Aside of this, Alan Wake has one of the most terrible level designs I ever experienced in my life. Most of the time you're on big open useless woods. They look like non linear, but you just follow the roads or some easy visual language signs and you're right on your way. Instead of what it looks like, it is totally linear. All the rest of the scenery are just useless(except from one place or another where you can find some collectables or weapon caches. But they're not even that hard to find...). Not only that but, also, most of the time you will be walking in these useless woods without ANYTHING happening at all. A literal ""walking simulator"", for the most part.Besides, Alan Wake have a ""ok"" gameplay with interesting mechanics. But it's a shame that you'll only see this game shining(ba dum tss) in very few moments. There's one part or another in this game where you'll think something like ""THAT'S what I was expecting from this game!"". It's really a shame that most of the time you will not be thinking this, but will be like ""oh my god, how could be this is a game? I'm only walking and walking"" or ""What a REALLY bad level design!"" or ""This game is SO frustrating! How can they throw me 10 enemies when I'm totally unarmed??"" and things like these...I'm really disappointed with this game. Shame. These guys from remedy gave us the perfectly crafted Max Payne and now it's really hard to believe that they gave us a game like Alan Wake...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It really depends on what you like.  It's a story about a writer who feels he's a hack and can only write one character so he writes a novel about a writer who feels he's a hack and can only write one character so he writes a novel about a writer who feels he's a hack and can only write one character so he writes a novel about a writer who feels he's a hack and can only write one character so he writes a novel about a writer who feels he's a hack and can only write one character so he writes a novel...(to an infinite level)...about a writer who feels he's a hack and can only write one character so he writes a novel about a writer who feels he's a hack and is being assaulted by the physical manifestations of his doubts and inner darkness.  It could be a better novel or movie.  You find manuscript pages throughout the game to flesh things out, but by the end I couldn't be bothered to read them.As far as gameplay, it's dull.  You walk down a forest path.  Some people posessed by darkness jump out at you.  You shine your flashlight on them to dissipate their dark shield and shoot them.  When you are getting swarmed, you drop a flare for some breathing space.  When you get tired of this current bunch of enemies, you toss out a flashbang.  Repeat endlessly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake review:It took me about 15 hours for my playthrough. The game was intense - atmosphere, sound, gfx, characters (everything) was very good, and the plot (story) was awesome. I got hooked with the game when I was about half-past-through it, and the novel-like-story kept me motivated untill the end. Fighting the evil ""darkness"" with light is a bit odd, but it is executed in perfection in this game. I played it with Keyboard+Mouse, but found out later, that the XBOX360 controller is a much better choice for this kind of game. I can recommend this game - and it doesn´t neccessarily have to be discounted for the purchase ;)Have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a very interesting game. It's main pull factor is it's story and more importantly, it's writing which is top notch and has that eerie vibe to it and crosses paths with the mystery of something like Twin Peaks and some characters resemble that series too.The gameplay is functional and engaging, the need to light up your enemies does provide slight tension and you can cross the line of having no supplies, however I never really had that issue on Normal difficulty. The only negative I can find is it can seem dragged out in some scenarios. Overall I recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is proof positive of the point that a story, properly told transcends all media and genres. A game that could be EASILY adapted for film or TV, Alan Wake is a game that is, in actuality, an interactive novel, and one that is just BEGGING for Star Trek's holodeck. Even in the intro sequence I found myself enjoying the game on a level that I have not enjoyed any other game before. Does that mean it's my favourite game? No. But even still it is a wonderful experience nonetheless. Even the fairly standard horror pacing and formula can't detract from this game, and so intricately tied to and interwoven with its plot the game really manages to tell a story while you battle shadow monsters with a Christmas light wearing sidekick (I am NOT making this up). While I am not a fan of the horror genre, and have never really read any Stephen King (to whom the tilts it's hat many times), the game was nevertheless thoroughly enjoyable. The only down-side to this interactive novel is that like a novel it is not immediately replayable. When you get to the last chapter, you don't feel any pressing need to start over again from the beginning, because what you have really enjoyed is not the thrill of the chase, being hunted by an insidious Lovecraftian shadow-demon, but the content of that story. But I think that is one negative we can all bear if games of this ilk were to become more common in the future. And really that actually makes the gameplay longer lasting easier to savour. Please Remedy, and ALL developers, give us more interactive novels, and less psychotically emotionless space marines killing freaking zombie demons from outer space.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wanted to play this for a long time, but missed a boat. And I am glad i picked it up eventually. Usually I rate any game very highly if the experience and plot are excellent, even though game play isn't too great. Alan wake is one of those games that i enjoy watching and listening, abit like MGS series. It has unique episodic chapter like a TV drama, and the way it end and introduce each episode using music and narration was very refreshing. I can understand why it isn't for everybody though. The plot is a bit trippy and mature that this isn't exactly your average horror action game. But that's why I liked it and left with wanting more,       About the DLC; American Night mare, it's POS, and I think it's the laziest produced game ever I've seen. They make you play same level three times using some lame♥♥♥♥♥excuse plot, and it has nothing to do with the original. I regret even playing it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake is a very atmospheric and fun 3rd person shooter, inspired by the Steven King novels, The Twilight Zone and Twin Peaks tv series. It has horror elements, but it's not that scary. It has a cheesy story, and if you like these sorts of things you should definitely check it out, it's a 7/10 for me.The cons:- Can get repetetive at times- Too many collectibles that are easy to miss, but you wanna collect and that may get frustrating- Face animation can look ridiculous at timesThe pros:- Very unique mechanics- Interesting characters- Great setting and atmosphere- Neat music- Presents itself like a cheesy Twilight Zone show/Steven King novel			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan wake is a great game with an immensely addicting story that makes gameplay habitual once you get engulfed in it. One of the finest first-rate games I have played in awhile that wins my award for originality.  It is surely ceepy and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The atmosphere is rather superb which can showcase a great work of art inside a video game. This game is as fun to play as it is to watch, but as the story progresses you find your self asking more questions then achieving answers, the combat system is rather generic and nothing to drool about but this game is a fine work of art. Not to mention if I had only one signal high note to offer this game out of the many, it would be that this is one console-to-PC port done right!All developers. Look here. A working game.

												Really great narrative and atmosphere, with a clear 'Twin Peaks' vibe. Gameplay is a bit naff sometimes but It's generally pretty good. Gets repetitive towards the end and does wear on people a bit. I liked it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be totally honest, I fail to see the appeal of Alan Wake. The story seemed gripping at first, but the poor controls of the game quickly had me shelving it. This game has a problem with the fact that it plays very similarly to the original Resident Evil games. You don't have a locked camera to deal with, but as hard as the combat system is, you'd might as well. If you want a challenging, psychological thriller, then this game is for you, but I'd highly recommend you only buy it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nothing stands between you and annihlation by an evil force.  Nothing..... except your flashlight.  And some flares. And flashbangs.  In a rural town.  With a tiny sheriff department.  Fight off the darkness taking posession of unexplained mobs that are presumably hunters or loggers by shining light on them until you can shoot them.  Have plot explained to you as a book from pages you find lying around.  Have those pages explain plot two chapters ahead of where you are.  Dodge flying axes and men with knives, but only three times in sucession before you get tired of feeling cool and have to just eat an axe to the face.  Search out coffee as a collectible that doesn't give you anything and piece together why we should care about the plot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
