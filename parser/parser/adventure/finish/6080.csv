												What's sad is that the minigames are better than some of the crap on the steam store nowadays. @-@+-Simple, easy and fun for any audience.-Colourful graphics-Social interaction is cool-Decent minigames-Fun (perhaps a little chessy) music to match the feeling of the game--Not very challenging-Limited amount of space for buildingThat's all I can think of. I played this game forever seven years ago. :DTl;dr: Buy if you want a fun, simple theme park sim. Don't if you want a challenge.			",508,242,16,55,74,9,82

												After playing this and the first Thrillville on my PSP, seeing this on the Steam store brought a wave of childhood memories. Buying this game will be one of the greatest decisions of your life. You can engage in conversations with anyone in the park and can even have relationships. The coaster building and park management mechanics are also very well done.			",216,28,2,32,14,3,31

												This game , IN MY OPINION, is BETTER than rollercoaster tycoon, With Nostalgia, it brings social Intercation, Cool Rides, a Wacky Scientist named Mortimer who looks like the guy from back to the Future,and overall, the best thing is the park itself, or PARKS, with an s, YUP, there are a total of 5 dif. Parks to play all with 3 areas with totally different genres. the 5 parks are, Thrillville Stunts, the Starter park based on action (duh),Which contains the areas Throttleville, Battleville,and Saddleville (cowboys). then there is Thrillville Explorer, which contains Relicville, Summitville, and Scurvyville ( WOO PIRATES!!!!!). then Thrillville Other worlds, with Uragiville,Astroville, and Oceanville. Thrillville Giants is next, with Candyville,LawnVille, and Casaville. FINALLY there is Thrillville Holidays, with Fallville, Winterville, and Summerville. the only downside is that it is kinda short.			",39,2,0,2,2,0,3

												Love this game. Everything about this game I love but it's missing multiplayer and that would be amazing in this game creating together, solving some missions together and even going past the restrictions and making something amazing. I would love to see a thrillville 3. (Edited to stop people freaking out :))Graphics: The game is kinda old now so the graphics are dated but they are fitting for this game and if changed, would ruin the game and for that the graphics make the game unique. Audio: The audio for the game are funny to listen too, helpful to listen and also really relaxing and extremely entertaining. Controls: Controls are extremely simple to get used too and really cannot judge or anything. Super amazing. He best thing about this game is the mini games. You create a massive theme park and you are able to interact with everything from cleaning up litter to entertaining the crowd to riding a roller coaster to playing the arcade games. I have no problems with this game and is worth the money you pay for it.			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												I had a great time replaying the game. I played this game as a kid on my PS2, and I recently rediscovered it on Steam. After having bought it, I quickly dove into it and had a great time. The controls are simple and not overly complicated, just like the menus. The coaster creator ROCKS, no waaaaaaay to hard mechanisms and controls. The graphics have changed since last time I played it (which is a looooooooooong time ago), but surely for the better. Just the overall feel and look of this game is a great theme park simulater where almost everything is possible and nothing is too complicated10/10, would play again			",47,3,1,7,3,1,1

												I had a lot of fun playing both Thrillville and Thrillville: Off the Rails on my PS2. Seeing as how I currently don't have access to a PS2, I had to get OTR on Steam. It's a very fun game, and well worth some of your time. It's similar to Rollercoaster Tycoon, but Thrillville concentrates on more of the theme park in general rather than just rollercoasters (although those are still fun as hell). Managing a theme park is made perfect and simple in Thrillville. While there are definitely some downsides (limited energy for each park??), I think OTR is one for the books.

												This game was released in 2007 and was one of the best games ever made and still is one of the best. Playing Thrillville after 9 years gave me the same feeling of when I first played it. It's a very fun, achieving, and the best tycoon game ever made. You build your own rides, customize your own park, interact with others and in the end make tons of cash.Being a park manager with Thrillvile however brings big responsibilities: people trying to sabatage your park, rides breaking down, hiring new staff, firing staff sabataging your business, marketing campaigns and more.Throughout thrillville there is always sometimes to do, wether it be building new rides, training new workers, installing new rides, stalls, games or even having fun on those stalls, rides, or games. There is a big buisness side to this game along with fun mixed in with it.I highly recommend this game as the nostalgia for me is very real and the content inside the game for a 1.5GB game is amazing and phoenominal. Not to mention I bought this game for $2. WORTH IT.			",101,26,3,3,18,5,10

A few years back, I got this game for my PSP, and it wasn't very fun because the graphics really sucked and it was choppy. Even though, the storyline was great, and the gameplay rocked. When I found this game on steam on sale for $3.99 and with better graphics/less choppiness, I couldn't resist. It certainly lives up to expectations, especially for a 2007 game! JUst love it.

												Would recommend this if you're into tycoons or sandbox sorts of games. It's very interactive as you can talk to the visitors of your park (Even flirt!!). And there is so many missions, five different parks with 3 different sections in each, it's crazy!I can understand why I spent so much of my childhood playing this on the PS2, what a classic!

												Beside the nostalgia, it's a pretty neat and simple park managing game. I feel like it's stuffed with tons of content from all the mini-games, guest interactions, and different customizations. There's a lot of creativity in designing coasters limited only by Park Electricity and Safety Requirements.			",42,18,0,3,2,2,1

												A very fun game.  Especially great if you played it on PS2 a while back when it came out.  Not as fun these days, but I find myself playing it longer than I thought I would.Pros:-The rollercoaster building system is great, kind of weird at first, but if using a controller, it becomes easier.-Since it's a PS2 game, there's nothing to buy, no DLC.  Everything's included.  The arcade games could be full games with a little modifying.  They're not just thrown in, they're nicely thought out, and they're fun.  One's even a 3D flying game, with great controls.-Can talk to guests.-Custom rollercoasters.-Run around your park in third person.-Interesting parksCons:-Power Meter gets annoying.-INVERT CAMERA MEANS THAT IN THE FLYING GAME, YOU HAVE UNIVERTED CONTROLS ON THE LEFT STICK.  WHY.-No decorating like RCT.-Can have only one of each arcade game, but that's fine because of the power meter annoyance.-No landscaping like RCT.-Customization could be better, but it was a PS2 game, though the PC version -could- have been upgraded in some way.  Though, looking at the date of the game, I really can't blame it too much.  What could have been added to make it better?  Not anything I can think of without changing the game entirely.-No tunnels for rollercoasters.-Only building in predetermined areas.Overall:A fun game with not much in the way of you and having fun.  Even though I said there were all these flaws, it's fun.  And they're only really ""flaws"" because I'm used to RCT.			",71,5,4,6,9,0,2

												Thrillville: Off the Rails is an adventure of a game, the sheet amount of content makes me incredulous. What makes it even better is the nostalgic feel when you play the minigames you played years ago. The arcade games have more content than most of the alpha games due to ""release"" soon.When your friends are away on spring break, or something like that. Just buy the game and get lost in the vast amount of content that it holds.it has baloons			",94,9,0,12,12,0,10

												I wish the original Thrillville was available for steam but the sequel is just as good. You basically build themeparks, eack park has three different themes to choose from, there are also mini games and side missions and of course building rollarcoasters. Its not as detailed as RTC or anything but that actually plays to the games strengths and you never get bored since there are plenty of other things to do besides build. I loves the original for PS2 but the PC port of the sequel works very well.			",91,15,0,17,10,0,8

												Ahh. Used to love this game when I was younger. It brings back so many memories.This PC port isn't so bad either. It runs really well for the most part, and is optimized pretty decently. The only issue I have with it is that there's no way to play the game windowed.Aside from that, it's a decent port. I can recommend this game if you liked games such as Rollercaster Tycoon and other games. It even has plenty of mini games to try out.			",119,22,3,6,6,2,5

 I did never thought I would find a PC port of a Thrillville game.  This port of the original game is really nice, and after 8 hours of playing I think I can write a review.Thrillville Off the Rails is a rollercoaster tycoon like game made by Frontier the devs who made both Rollercoaster Tycoon and Planet Coaster. What sets thrillville apart from the other tycoon games is that you are actually able to directly interact with your guests, play minigames, and go through a campaing while you build your dream park.Create your own Golf Courses and Race Tracks (no matter how cheap they are), Create the crazyest coasters imagineable or remake some famous ones.Also after checking through the file system of Thrillville Off the Rails, I can see a possible modding career in it's future. Also god bless Track assist.However this game does have it's downsides.[b/]For one you can't keep building endlessly. Each region of the park has a ""Power Meter"" this acts as a game balance mechanism to prevnet putting too much objects in one part of the park, and proably also acted as a RAM check for the orignal PS2 release. So this will limit the creativity of the rides you can make.Secondly you have very little control over the enviorments in each of the areas. You can not add/remove decorations, some will disapear if a coaster or race track runs through it. But the majority will simply stop you from building your coaster where you want it.The height limit stops me from building big♥♥♥♥♥rollercoaster like King Da Ka ",31,1,0,2,4,0,3

												I remember getting this hame for the PS2 back in 2007, man it was so good, a Theme Park Tycoon Game that featured so much more, everything from building the rollercoasters with crazy addons and features such as sudden drops to having the coaster go into a cannon and shoot the park attendents into the air only to have them parachute down. You even get to ride the rides yourself after that you can roam around the park talk to your guests make the feel welcome get opnions on how ur park is doing and what you can do to make it even better. The game is loaded complete with its own minigames to simulate playing the arcades at a real life amusment park the viraity is so well done can keep you busy for hours. The game's has a solid soundtrack with a original radio channel in the main game called PARK radio with its own DJ and all you can defentaly tell they put effort into it. The only con I could think of is they not made a third game this series is long due for a third entry.			",387,79,13,42,55,5,38

												It might be impossible to be bored with this game! I bought it because of nostalgia, and I play it for fun. Thrillville OTR is challenging and offers a wide variety of minigames and tasks while you build and customize many different theme parks. The story is fine, I don't particularly care for it much. A sappy corporate rival park builder is a threat to stealing your visitors and you have to just build better parks and show ""Globo Joy"" who's boss.I personally dislike the high graphics setting because it makes the character models look creepy. I recommend putting graphics down a notch and disabling voice. It gives a more classic feel to it and it also forces you to actually read the dialogue, which I actually rather do. Check this one out. Ten bucks and it's basically 35 games in one. Can't go wrong!			",55,1,0,4,2,0,4

Pre-cursorLet's get things straight here. This is one of my all time favorite games from my childhood. I originally played this game on the Nintendo Wii when I was 7 years old. I don't mean to hate on this game itself to the slightest bit. As I said, it is one of my favorite games and it will always be one of my favorite games. Now that we've gotten that straight, let's move onto the complaint.StorySo, I just bought this game on Steam while it was on sale for $2.49 as I cannot see myself paying anymore than that for a game that I already own on another console. After I buy it, I'm excited to play it so, I presume to download the game which is a hefty 1.5 GB download which didn't really throw me off there. I just wanted to include the size of the download in-case anyone reading this was curious how big the download is. So once it finishes downloading which took about an hour and a half, I run the game. The first time I run the game, it crashes. So, I decide to launch it again. When I did launch it again, I got it to run but the MAIN MENU was running at 4 FPS which I will get to in a bit. At this point, I just decide to turn down the graphics settings in the options menu which to be honest, ran slower than the main menu (Around 2 FPS). After I change the graphics settings, I had to restart the game because it was being EXTREMELY slow. So after I restart the game, things are starting to run promisingly so, I start a new game. When it got to the cutscene, my CPU looked like it was about to♥♥♥♥♥♥itself. Looking in Task Manager I noticed the game was using 50% of my CPU usage. Again, technical details in a bit. It finally got through the cutscene and into the game. Let me just get something else straight here. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, runs at a MUCH better frame-rate than this game could EVER run at on this machine. That is kind of sad. As soon as I saw the game running so slow, I decided to benchmark the frame-rate. The results of the benchmark are as follows. Max FPS: 15 Min FPS: 2 Avg FPS: 9Ummm... what? Why the hell does this game run SOOO slow? That is BEYOND unplayable. After I realized all of this was happening, I sent Steam a request for a refund for the game.Technical DetailsSo, now we are on to the technical details. Let's start off with the hardware specifications of my computer. OS: Windows 10 Processor: Intel Core i3 Hyperthreaded Dual-Core 2.5 GHz Memory: 4 GB Graphics: Intel HD 4000 DirectX®: 11.0 Hard Drive: 700 GB Internal; 1 TB External (Game was installed to internal)Now the minimum specifications for the game. OS: Windows 2000/XP/Vista Processor: Intel Pentium III 1.0 GHz or Athlon XP Memory: 256 MB Graphics: 64 MB 3D graphics with Vertex Shader and Pixel Shader capability (Pretty much any graphics card from the last decade) DirectX®: 9.0c Hard Drive: 3.9 GBI think my computer should at least be able to run the game half ♥♥♥♥ing decent if you know what I mean.ConclusionIn my opinion, even if you have a pretty good PC that can run all of the recent AAA titles, you shouldn't buy this game. It appears that most recent computers are not able to run this at a decent frame-rate and you can save $9.99 (Or $2.49 if you buy it on sale). If you REALLY want to play this game, just buy it for the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, or even the Sony PlayStation 2. That's all I have to say about this product.RatingConsole Game: 10/10PC Game: 1/10			",28,4,2,2,9,0,2

												I bought this like many others from the fun I remember having with the first game on the Xbox when it came out.Before I begin I want to say that I am not recommending this game not because of its gameplay, but more because of its lack of improvement. It's not a bad game.Pros:-- Like the first one, the game is great for kids. It's simple and easy to learn. Most of it is social interaction and fulfilling ride challanges.-- Interaction with all aspects of the park. Whether it's training employeess managing park finances, or playing minigames, you can still control your park.Cons:--This is EXACTLY like the first game. The mechanics haven't changed at all and I felt like I was paying for an expansion more than a sequel. It actually got rather boring.--Lack of freedom with rides. This was the same problem with the first game. SimCoaster, SimTheme Park, and RollerCoaster Tycoon didn't force you to build only in dedicated zones as well as have a ""power"" bar to limit your complexity on the park, making ride creativity less than fun because you always had to worry about power management.For the TL;DR: this game is exactly like the first one. If you want a game that's fun for kids, buy it. If you want a better amusement park game in nearly every single aspect, buy Rollercoaster Tycoon, SimTheme Park, or SimCoaster.			",136,12,7,7,22,3,8

												No idea what I'm playing lol. Just a kids game with rollercoasters and amusement vendors. No onder why you took it off the console so quickly. Sorry but nobody here, including me likes such a game. Maybe kids do but i don't the game itself is a ripoff of most amusement park games and has no interest for me.			",71,13,1,6,11,2,8

What this game is:•Theme Park Manager/Builder•Compilation of party games (enough fun for 4 local Players)•Rollercoaster builderWhy you should consider buying Thrillville®: Off the Rails™:Building rollercoasters and riding theme park rides, then pretending you are on them can be nice. The other awesome part of this game is that you can play the majority of the mini-games with 4-players locally.What you need to enjoy this game optimally:any old 4-port USB hub and 4 Logitech F310 controllers.

												6/10I got this purely based on nostalgia. The game is old and the graphics are not very good.Pros: Has a whole bunch of minigames that are addicting         Has a decent story         You can get hoes'.          Is fun to play with friendsCons: Has a very limited amount of customization. There is only 4 shirts, 4 pants, and 4 hairstyles ffs.           Bad graphics          Can't steal others girlfriends.          Can't get with adults.          Can't BE a adult.          Gets boring pretty fast.          Can't build many coasters.          Not a single easter egg in sight.          Can't be a robot.The game is alright and I do recommend this to people who like minigames and such. But the story isn't the greatest.Maybe give it to children or something.			",19,4,0,2,2,0,0

												I love this game and I've been playing it for years. Originally had it on the Wii, and the controls are quite a bit different on the PC but that doesn't matter since they're so simple anyways. Most of the missions are a lot of fun and you can get quite creative when creating the WHOA-coasters!9/10 would recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Animated cut-scenes looked great but the character sprites in the actual game did not. Their facial expressions were creepy and they constantly repeated lines. The mini games didn't have very good instructions so things didn't make sense. For example the dance mini game didn't really explain what the symbols actually meant and how to hit some of the directions (if that made any sense). Overall, the game is actually very good and addicting. You get to create your character and even name him/her. For some reason children can also manage the theme park. The missions were really well done and it gave me something to do in the park if I got bored. Also, the game uses REAL music instead of music specifically designed for the game. For example they used Natasha Bedingfeild's (I think I misspelled it) Unwritten song and Toby Mac's ""I'll be for You."" The only major problem with this game is the character sprite design and the lack of explanation in the mini games. Keep in mind this is really just a cheap version of Roller Coaster Tycoon with a story line. Granted it is worth $10 and I would recommend this game for you or a friend.			",5,0,0,0,4,0,0

												Great game for all ages, you manage a theme park that people will love! Create coasters, race tracks, and water rides. Build rides, paint almost anything, play games, and help nerds get laid. The only down side to this game is the graphics. They are disgusting for 2007. Also, you will proably need to change the compatibilty for your OS to Windows 2000. Over, this game is a lot of fun!			",49,5,2,2,8,0,4

												You are Thrillville's park manager! As the park manager, your job is to; ride rides, talk to people, play games, and have an almost incalculable amout of fun! This game gives you the chance to design rollercoasters and racetracks, and to place rides, arcades and stalls, allowing you to ride and play games each one! In many different, themed parks, where you can also socialize and date the park guests and even challenge them to games and races!The P A R K Radio has a great mix of songs which makes the background noise of the game very pleasent to listen to.And the minigames are amazing, just like a whole buch of old flash games that may bring back fond memories.
