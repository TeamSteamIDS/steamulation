												I'm a big fan of Rocket Knight Adventures. To me, it's probably one of the best-designed videogames of all time. Rocket Knight 2010 is...surprisingly decent. I wouldn't put it on the level of the 16-bit games though.Since I've already written the end of the review, I'm going to skip past the nonsense about plot and whatever whatever. You're an opossum with a jetpack, go fly around and hit stuff with your sword. Each of the four levels in this game are broken up into multiple stages. Typically, one stage will have the RK exploring, doing a lot of platforming, and collecting treasure while smashing baddies. Then there are the 2D shooter stages, which are pretty self-explanatory. Finally, there's the boss stages, which are also self-explanatory.RK2010 uses a combo-based scoring system, which is pretty neat. Destroying enemies and collecting items in a short span of time can lead to big points. There are even leaderboards for showing off. It can be really enjoyable finding the perfect route for flying through enemies, their attacks, and accumulating a huge score in the process. Unfortunately, the pacing hits a snag after the second level, as the remainder of enemies in the game take multiple hits to kill. Changes in the level-design from the second level on also effect the pacing, with lots of switches to flip, timed platforms, frozen jetpack fun, and more traps. I'd rather have more of the first level, since it gives Sparkster room to do what he does best.The controls and mechanics are very solid. Unlike the prior games, Sparkster's jetpack works with a button-press, and not hold to charge and release. It works well in this game, though he can only dash once in mid-air. Since the jet-pack recharges when not in use, I would have preferred to see unlimited boosts (as long as meter remains). Maybe it's a bad idea, since it would require extensive changes to the level-design, but it could be effective for those multiple hit enemies.Altogether, Rocket Knight 2010 is a good game. If you're looking for an entertaining platformer and don't mind a couple minor issues, give this game a look.But like I said in the beginning(end?) of this review, RK 2010 is the weakest of the four titles. Why? It's lacking in creativity, imagination, and...well...spark. It's a very safe game. While the 16-bit games were all handled by different directors, they threw around a lot of ideas when it came to level-design, bosses, and how Sparkster controls. Rocket Knight Adventures (the first game) took a lot of risks. It gave Sparkster all these tools, but forced him into situations where dashing around could get him killed. The player could approach the game as a straight platformer with some gimmicks, or they could employ the jet-pack to its full extent (RKA was a fairly difficult game regardless). The sequels went in different directions, employing more open-ended level design and a greater emphasis on exploration. They took a concept and a base that already worked, and made some dramatic changes.RK2010 offers a promising concept: The pigs and wolves are working together. The enemies of RKA and Sparkster SNES teaming up? This should to a lot of cool bosses and crazy level-designs. The results however just leave a lot to be desired. There are only four boss fights in RK2010, and none of them are nearly as memorable as the final battle with Axel Gear, the pig army's supercomputer, and so on. I think RK2010 was too focused on designing encounters and levels that would make sense. They wanted a specific flow, so that players aren't thrown off by sudden shifts in level or enemy design. Instead of going through all that, why not go all out? Don't ask why the pig army has a giant mecha crab-thing in an underwater tunnel. Instead, ask why not? Along those sames lines: Why not have Sparkster run through a stage filled with giant drums, and wolves would pop out of horns? Why not fight a lizard magician on top of a battle-ship? I don't care about cohesiveness in my opossum-jetpack-knight videogame. I just want to see awesome and unique stuff.All that ranting aside, RK2010 is still a good game, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you never play any of the 16-bit games.

												Rocket Knight!Excellently fun game that takes things back to the basics, and it works, its a breath of fresh air.If you played Rocket Knight Adventures 1 and 2 before, then you'll enjoy this game just as much, the gameplay is pretty much the same as the classic with a few improvements made here and there.The game still comprises of platforming segmants, boss battles and of course, the flying segments which play in the same waya side scrolling shoot'em up plays, all in all, a nice variation and all of these sections are fun in their own way.The music and sound effects are nothing to write home about but they do a good enough job with a few memorable themes here and there.The graphics are the biggest change in this game as it is now 2.5D and it looks great, nice and cartoony and it keeps the feel of the originals whilst updating them and it looks lovely.My personal opinion : If you're gonna go from a side scrolling 2D game, and try to give it a modern spin, keep it 2.5D, I think this is where the Sonic Series lost control and came off the rails a bit.

												I remember playing Rocket Knight Adventures on Sega Genesis so many years back.  It was absolutely amazing.  When they released a sequel, Sparkster (Rocket Knight Adventures 2) a year or two later, it wasn't quite as good as the original but still felt true to the series.  In my opinion, these games were Konami's response to Sonic the Hedgehog.And then things went quiet for Sparkster, our rocket hero.Then, 15-16 years go by and Konami reveals this game.  A sequel to the original games.When I first saw the trailer, I was just excited to play this game.  While it has the feel of 3D to it, it has kept the original 2D game play that I grew up with.  Sure, there are some new tricks and moves, but that is how the game has been kept fresh all these years.They even played a remix of the original Stage 1 theme from RKA.  When I first heard that, so many good memories came rushing back.A game that you must definitely play.			",63,9,0,3,0,3,4

												A decent 3D sidescroller that hearkens back to and combines certain elements of the Genesis originals. It's clear that the developer of this game had a lot of love for the games that preceded it, so if you're a fan of Sparkster from the 16-bit era, you'll love this one, too. Some elements have been reimagined and Westernized, but this small bit of creative license doesn't detract from the overall good presentation. Hard Mode is surprisingly brutal, too, which adds a bit of replayability. Regardless, I'm forced to admit that without the nostalgia bomb that accompanies it, it's probably just an average game. Newcomers to the series would probably do better to play the earlier installments and come back to this one when they've gained an appreciation for the series.			",1354,349,42,84,95,8,80

												Rocket Knight is an old-school 2.5D action platformer, the last (so far, at least) in a series that started back in 1993 with Rocket Knight Adventures for Sega Genesis. RK is a sequel, not a remake. You play as Sparkster, an opossum equipped with a mighty sword and a powerful jetpack. While this is the first game of the series that I've played, I had tons of fun!Pros & Cons:üëç Gaming style that much resembles the old platformers from early-to-mid 90's.üëç Beautiful 2.5D graphics.üëç Out of a total of 14 rather lenghty stages, we have 7 platform stages, 3 shoot'em-up stages, and 4 bosses, so hurray for variety!üëç Also on the subject of variety, levels feel very unique (especially across each of the  ""episodes""), each introducing new mechanics and enemies.üëç Sparkster has a decent array of skills that you'll take some time to master.üëç Boss battles are really smart, allowing for multiple strategies, and probably requiring you to fail over and over until you've developed a nice strategy.üëç The game could be really unforgiving, but since you're allowed to restart the current level from scratch, keeping lives, time, and points you had when you started it, RK avoid being unnecessarily frustrating.üëç There are 3 levels of difficulty for all kinds of player: Normal (""Easy""), Hard (""Normal""), and Gold (""Hard""). You could breeze through the game on Normal in about an hour and a half, if you explore the stages a bit. But you can also beat the game in less than an hour if you just rush to the finish (not counting the time you spend when you restart a level).¬± Music, while modern, has a retro feel, but it's not very memorable.¬± Story and characters aren't interesting or well-developed, but I honestly didn't miss something better on that area. I'd rather have this than some far-fetched plot that ends up being lame.¬± The game is a bit short, but I found it to have some replayability. Levels change a bit on Hard compared to Normal (mostly enemies), and you have only 4 hearts instead of 10 on Gold mode (you play the Hard levels). Still, the new challenges ended up being fun enough for me.¬± It's only available in 4 of the Steam Stores: Brazil, New Zealand, USA and UK (and in most of other countries that use these Stores as price reference). This sucks, but if you're reading this review, it's probably available for you. ;)üëé The skill you'll use the most, which is a dash in one of 8 directions with your jetpack, is a bit too tricky to master. Sometimes you end up dashing diagonally when you wanted to dash orthogonally, and that can really screw you up. If you're using a controller, like I did, I'd recommend using the D-Pad, especially in platformer and boss stages in Gold mode for more precision (it's still not perfect, but way better than the analogue stick).üëé The game suggests you to play with a controller, but all in-game help shows only keyboard keys, which is lame. And I'm pretty sure you can't customize the controls.üëé Some checkpoints are poorly placed, and that's especially frustrating on Gold mode.üëé Except for the Store in Brazil, I think this game is a bit overpriced.All in all, I had a blast playing this game, and it took me over 12 hours to get all achievements. My numb thumb is proof that RK is indeed an old-school game, and nice one at that.			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

												Looks absolutely beautiful; but plays like your average, everyday, shovelware cute-mascot-character platformer.It's a poor imitation of the original Rocket Knight Adventures game: instead of sharp, responsive controls, Rocket Knight suffers from floaty controls and poor hit detection. To be honest, there's little to describe the game other than 'mediocre' - mediocre platforming, mediocre Gradius-style flight sections, mediocre soundtrack (even the remixed first level theme feels weak and listless). The game's definitely beautiful, though, in a charming CGI-cartoon-character kind of way - lots of wacky cartoon contraptions and scenery to be seen.It's nothing special, but if you have an afternoon to waste ... eh.[edit] Further thoughts: the game itself recommends that you use a controller; but despite being a console port, all of the button prompts displayed - both in menus and in-game - assume you're using the keyboard, whether or not you are using a controller (tested with a wired Xbox 360 pad). There's no option to re-map controls, either, and the 'Controls' screen only displays the keyboard mappings.In later sections of the game, you're pitted against enemies with rapid-fire projectile weapons - which, combined with Sparkster's poor manoeuvrability and tendency to fall 'into' enemies, quickly becomes frustrating.The jetpack mechanic is flawed - rather than recharge at a set rate, it rapidly recharges to about 75% capacity, and then continues to recharge to 100% at a snail's pace. So after performing a platforming section, or two of your three possible offensive moves, you'll be waiting for your bar to slooooowly recharge to full. Pointless.If you can think of a platforming game sin - blind-faith leaps onto off-screen platforms, tiny platforms located above falls into nothingness, timed platforming sections, enemies with shields or invulnerability while attacking - this game features them.The enemy AI is terrible - they'll either attack you head-on, or fruitlessly attempt to attack you through the floor.Finally, the main menu is set up so that the default option when selecting 'Arcade mode' - i.e. the main mode of play - is 'New Game', even if you already have a saved game in progress. It's a minor annoyance, but surely the default option should have been 'Continue'?...			",178,45,3,12,11,1,19

												Not up to the Rocket Knight/Sparkster name as the game is incredibly easier and doesn't have the tight platforming you'd expect from it. However it's by no means bad, it's just not as good as it's 16-bit counter parts on the SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive and Super Nintendo. If you're looking for an amusing platformer with some fun elements to it, this is your game, it's fun, it's got some variety to the gameplay, the game looks good, sounds good, however if you're looking for a new Sparkster? This may be lacking to you, but you can still have fun with it if you look past these flaws.  ",229,14,5,16,5,0,7

												***Simple part of the review***Pros+ Good and fun arcade gameplay.+ Easy to pick up and play.+ The Konami Code works in this game so you can unlock costumes and other modes straight away if you just want to mess around for fun.+ Average graphics for a 2.5D game which was made during the retro revival era.+ The previous games in this series are awesome+ You can unlock and play Gold Sparkster + You can unlock and play as Axel Gear (The series big main dark knight villain)Cons+ Forgettable soundtrack apart from 2 songs which one is an orchestrated version of the first stage from Rocket Knight Adventures 1 and the other one later in game is inspired by the final stage from the same game.+ Unforgiving bomb bouncing physics that can lead to health damage or deaths.+ Shortest game in the series.+ Out shined by its predecessors.+ Horrible boss battles and poor attack detection from the player since sparkster has been nerfed in this game.7.5/10 ""Good""Its a pretty good game but as a hardcore fan of the Rocket Knight series this one of the weakest entries in the series but that doesn't mean this game is bad, actually all 4 rocket knight games are good with the first game on the Megadrive/Genesis being 10/10 perfection.The price tag of ¬£12 is overpriced and this game needs to be on sale more often about 75% off its highly recomended for below ¬£5 price tag.I grew up playing the Rocket Knight Adventures series, this game is pretty good the level design feels less chaotic fun than the predecessors, the level design in later levels feel like they were done on a pretty basic level builder software.Boss battles and some enemies require to be beaten in a specific way and this game doesn't have friendly hit boxes and physics so you feel slightly under powered compared to the previous games were sparkster was much more funner to control because of he was so over powered.Your playing as a badass cute furry knight, with a beam sword, a jet pack, and a huge move list throughout the series. Whats not to love? Sparkster is one of the most badass also cutest heroes in gaming if this game isn't your kind of thing then I recomend you play the very first game then work your way to its sequels.

												It's a fun game best experienced with a controller. I never played the original so I don't have anything to compare it to. There is some deeper strategy in figuring out the optimal way to get through enemies, but I just had to brute force it sometimes. However, some bosses require adherence to the level design. For $15 it is a bit much in the current climate of low cost indie titles, but I'm glad I played it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocket Knight was a great game for the Sega Genesis, due to its fast-paced, almost arcadey, nature and the fun of what you got due to the limitations of games on consoles at the time. This game is pretty much exactly the same as the previous Rocket Knight game - the physics are similar and the gameplay mechanics are still entirely intact - but it doesn't quite do anything interesting. This could pretty much be Rocket Knight 2, released a year after the original game, if you ignore the 3D graphics. The gameplay is good but not great, the story is not told particularly well, and the platforming is a bit inconsistent at times. Though I'm down on this game for not being inventive, it is still a good follow-up to the original Rocket Knight game. If you've ever wanted another Rocket Knight game, this is exactly that, for all the strengths and weaknesses that entails. 3 out of 5 foxes.			",252,85,5,23,8,4,11

												Charming retro platformer.  I never played the original Rocket Knight adventures, but this game makes me want to.  While the graphics are hit and miss in places, favoring a 2.5-d look, the gameplay is solid, featuring your standard platforming with the addition of A JETPACK!  And really, what can't be made better with the addition of a jetpack?  The game is fun to play and offers a very enjoyable twist on some retro classics.  Makes me yearn for a re-release of the original Rocket Knight games on the Genesis and the SNES.			",73,23,0,18,2,0,9

												One word description of this game: Bittersweet.Although I was excited for the reboot of everyone's favorite opossum knight, the game feels somewhat trivialized by modern game design. But it's not bad and I get why they streamlined some of RKA. I just wish they could've included the Genesis game somehow to bring back Sparkster.Since 2010 nothing has been said about Sparkster's return, and knowing Konami it should probably stay that way. Hopefully the IP will be given to someone else in the future. Or maybe Sparkster for Smash. (Maybe.)Playing PossumIf you're wondering how Sparkster controls to his previous games, he is more like his SNES sequel. (Not the Genesis sequel). To casual players, instead of controlling both your attacks and rocket-boosts with the same button you have both mapped to separate buttons. They also added in a projectile button and a glide that has some usage other than his boost attack and sword.This was probably for the best because you get more control over Sparkster's rocket-pack, but his air-dash ability is absent. I would've liked for the classic methological approach of controlling your boost meter for being a good player as well as the sword doing more damage than the projectile attack.Again, a compromise was made for newcomers, so he was made more simplistic. I don't have any qualms with the new gameplay; it keeps the basic formula the same and Sparkster controls just fine. The drill attack is a neat little addition to the RK arsenal and it comes into play in the final boss. My main issues with RK (2010) are the lacking level variety and the low replayability, not simply the short length. (The original game wasn't that long but it did a lot more with its time.)Less Bang for Your TimeThe first glaring issue with the game is how formulaic it feels compared to the original, and even to the subpar sequel(s) on both the SNES and Genesis. Every area of the game follows this exact process: Platformer Stage (2D platform stuff)---> Rocket Flying Stage (Shoot-em-up-lite) ---> Boss Fight.As my younger self asked after playing this game, ""Where are the robot boxing parts? Where are the maze levels? Where are the various vehicles in the sequels?"" There are also no miniboses; no level gimmicks or specific bosses in different gameplay modes; and there is no hard-mode bonus boss-fight worth the hassle. Speaking of hard mode, the hardest mode(1 hit) isn't as difficult as it sounds. Sure, it can be frustrating at some sections of the game, but it won't take you too many tries to get the patterns down of all the bosses and levels. I was hoping there would be a secret boss-fight at the end... But there isn't anything to find. Just a stupid cutscene that makes me smile a bit.You then have some score-challenges and a Axel Gear skin. A nice concession for fans, but there's nothing to bring you back for another round when you're finished. Oh, and I do like that the Konami Code still lets you unlock everything from the title screen. The soundtrack is also underwhelming compared to the original games. The orchestral update on the classic theme is fine the first time around, and the rest is forgettable. All in all, despite knowing how much the devs wanted to bring back Sparkster, the execution of the game is severely lacking.One More Boost for Old Time's SakeI don't dislike this game. I boot it up every now and then for what it's worth. Is it overpriced? Sure, it can be if you value getting tons of gameplay time. I got my money's worth for the 4 to 5 hours of my first playthrough collecting everything and exploring as much as possible.But I would've more enjoyed seeing Sparkster return to his former glory, or at least having his past glories playable once more for the sake of nostalgia alone.Never go out with a whisper, Rocketeer; always go with a bang.

												Anyone who was lucky enough to play rocket knight adventures on the sega mega drive back in the day should love this game, and if you like old school side scrolling adventure games like i do this game is definantly worth checking out.			",118,11,4,2,5,2,2

												A pretty good sequel to the original genesis title.  I advise you to play the original ""Rocket Knight Adventures"" on a genesis emulator if you never have.  Both of these games are great, though the second seemed a bit short, but maybe that's just because I wanted more.			",266,35,1,41,11,0,18

												Wow, for a retro revival game this one is fantastic. I never played the original but after this I need too. I can't think of a single flaw in this game. The difficulty curb is perfect, the controls are smooth and quick, the aesthetics are great and have a steampunk feel to them, even the platforming and shmup mechanics work well together. Definitely worth getting for retro fans.			",289,43,13,25,39,6,49

												Rocket Knight loosely follows the same gameplay elements from the original SEGA Genesis classic, Rocket Knight Adventures. However, due to slippery controls, sloppy hitboxes, and bare bones platforming, this is a game that actually should of tried, or not have existed at all.Biggest complaint is the enemy projectiles. You can't deflect bullets, missiles, shurikens, etc. but you CAN deflect bombs and dynamite...which could fly of screen and back in to hit you in the face. These projectiles can fill up the screen fast, and since your rocket blast doesn't make you invulnarable, it leads to alot of stop-and-go frustrations.Don't bother with this one and stick with the good ol classic.

												I'm a huge fan of the two original Genesis/Megadrive titles. The controls are tight, the sound and music is gorgeous, the graphics are intense, the level and character design is superior, and the gameplay is hard as hell.Sadly, none of these are present in this reboot...-Controls: Feels like I'm always playing an ice level.-Sound: Weak. I even heard a few stock sounds.-Music: Although it doesn't sound like mid-90's MIDI files, it doesn't sound good.-Graphics: Kind've muddy. Combined with the controls it feels like playing an N64 game while heavily intoxicated.-Character Design: The wolves are boring and lifeless compared to the hogs in the original. The Knight himself lacks his original attitude and just comes off as smug. He isn't as adorable as the original either.-Gameplay: The most important part; it's way too freaking easy. There wasn't even a boss on level 1! Throughout the 80's and 90's, Konami gained the reputation of making extremely awesome yet extremely difficult games. Rocket Knight was definitely no exception.In conclusion: As many have said, go pick up the original(s)!			",141,50,4,7,11,4,12

												TL;DR: Designed for children of the modern era, not for fans of the original games.Difficulty: Easy - The game poses little challenge to anyone but children of the modern era, with one one or two small moments where some thought or skill is required.Graphics: Good - Consistent style persists throughout and while I don't personally like the childish theme or the re-design of the main character, there's nothing too bad about the graphical direction in general.Mechanics: Decent - Most mechanics are used enough in general play to warrant being there and most of varying amount of attacks are satisfying to use. Although there is one attack that I never used because there was never had a moment where it could have been useful.Conveyance: Decent - A little over the top with the controls, but generally nothing offensive; The game's forward path was always obvious.Music: Good direction, the mood of the scene was conveyed well enough, but the music was nothing memorable; I don't think there was much reference to the old games' music but if there was then it didn't trigger any kind of nostalgia.Bug: When I got to the part of the game where you jump from airship to airship, the second airship did not show up for me until after I killed myself.

												I'd say pass on this one unless it's 2 bucks or less. I paid $7.50 when it was half off and it's definitely not worth that much. It's really fun at first. It's reminicent of side scrollers like Sonic the Hedgehog in it's presentation and how it controls, which is a plus. It just didn't really hold my interest. After about stage 4, all regular enemies start taking more than one hit to kill, so you can't use the dash attack to kill anything anymore, which was how I was killing everything up to that point. So the game basically decided to take away what was fun about it so I decided I'd rather play something else.			",256,41,3,21,4,2,8

												I don't really reccomend this game. To be honest, it doesn't hold a candle to any of the previous incarnations of Sparkster as far as gameplay goes. Combine that with the short length and you've got a recipe for disappointment.			",164,29,0,24,8,1,16

												No where near as fun as the original Genisis game. Such a shame, this is short and fairly repetitive. The mechanics are simple so the game ends up just throwing more and more nonsense your way as the game progresses as artifical difficulty. The only parts you'll end up dying on are the few sections where the game throws really tight enviornmental obstacles in your way, but the controls aren't percise enough. Such a shame, mediocre at best, and not worth the asking price at all.			",602,153,13,64,36,8,87

												Don't play this.It's a reboot of an old series, rocket knight adventures for the genesis, and sparkster for hte genesis, and another completely different game with the same name, sparkster, for the snes. maybe the confustion there is why it didn't take off. THOSE games are amazing: this one has small, really easy elvels and plays kinda sluggish in comparison.			",290,50,4,59,28,4,51

												While a tad pricey for it's old-school level of content, this is definitely a solid platformer that brings everything unique and engaging about the original Rocket Knight games into a whole new generation. Suited for both veterans of the original games and people new to the series, while boasting a steady difficulty increase and fluid gameplay, this is worth picking up during a Steam Sale.

												So I was a big fan of the original Rocket Knight Adventures on the Sega Genesis. I played that game religiously. Its controls were pretty tight, the mechanics were fun and simple, the levels were clever and well-designed, the boss battles were intense, unique, and gave you a feeling of intimidation, and the atmosphere and music were unforgettable. This game is that game's shadow. If you want a llittle bit of nostalgia and want to just drop in on Sparkster to say hi, this is a game I can recommend. If you're looking for the sequel Rocket Knight Adventures deserved, this isn't it.The plot of the game is similar to the first, but with less story and character and more generic everything. The controls are somewhat sloppy, as Sparkster's foray into the realm of 3D did not treat him kindly.This game took the base premise of the previous game (an opossum in a suit of armor with rocket gameplay) and took away everything that made it truly stand out. The most GLARING problem is that there is little to no presentation with the game at all. Part of what made the original Rocket Knight fun was the art design and the intense musical score. While the premise was fun and watching the pigs fly away in burning balls of underwear, it still took itself seriously. You were still fighting a war and war is intense. The environments that Sparkster went through were perilous and terrifying. The dingy steampunk atmosphere of the first and the places you had to go to so that you could find out that your nemesis wasn't exactly what you thought he was were incredible! Every boss felt difficult but fair (except for the mech fight, screw that noise)THIS GAME takes its little bomb mechanic and waives it around like a flag made of freaking unicorn farts and rainbows. The mechanic itself is sloppy and unpredictable, and a lazy way to take away difficulty from the game while claiming to add variety. It was completely unnecessary. The laser attack you get while flying is unbalanced and a lazy way to make it so that the game doesn't have to have tight controls. Many of the boss battles are frustrating primarily because there's no rhyme or reason to what they do, and half the time, beating the boss involves using some sort of dumb gimmick, making the game less about how good you are at killing things, and more how good you are at adopting new mechanics that they're proud of.That being said, it's not all bad. I still enjoyed the game overall, but having the legacy of Rocket Knight Adventures attached to it made it hard to take seriously in the way that it was presented.4/10			",166,11,1,2,5,1,12

												~~TeeMans Two-Hour Taster~~Hey now this is more like it! Pretty much delivers what it promises on the tin with a dash of Shump. Levels go from left to right for the most part but there's a lot of latitude to play with. There's even a Metroid-esque escape sequence which was really nice.How far along ~~ Got to the final boss and died onceBits I liked ~~ Story was well presented. Movement was OK but not super intuitive. Boss fights get really meaty towards the end; the penultimate boss a genuine challenge and the final one didn't look at easier!Bits I didn't ~~ The final platforming level is difficult platforming mixing with lousy checkpoints, which is a real bummer as it's left a bad taste in my mouth despite really enjoying the rest of the game. Final boss fight looked to be some pretty hot ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t.I'd rather be playing ~~ Rayman Origins.Return for more ~~ Probably not. It's not much longer than this and I'm not keen to grind out the last boss.			",355,129,23,61,34,5,40
