												Sleeping Dogs was originally going to be a direct sequel in the True Crime series many years before actually coming out. Thankfully, this never came to fruition. After a few changes, and a few publishers later, Sleeping Dogs came to be. Some will say it is the spiritual successor to the True Crime series. I'd like to think the connection never happened. Mainly because this game is just that good. Too good to be tied to a deservedly so dead series. Sleeping Dogs takes place in Hong Kong, and has you playing the role of an undercover cop with ties to a small group of triads, as you work your way up through the ranks, and work from both sides, as a straight up police officer, and an undercover officer playing a triad member who gets in too deep. It's a risky business, but for our main protagonist Wei Shen, it's all part of his life now. Sleeping Dogs is an open world action game modeled after games like Grand Theft Auto. You can run around freely, drive cars and ride motorcycles, and either take on main and side missions, or do other things as you progress through the game. Sadly, there is not much to do in terms of sandbox play. The world is very nicely detailed, and seems to be alive with the amount of people you will see moving about, but there just is not enough freedom to make this a real sandbox open world game. Most of the things you'll find yourself doing will be set up as part of the game instead. And anything you make up along the way will be few and far in between. Unlike open world games like San Andreas or Just Cause 2, where you can spend countless hours outside of any scripted events, making the game seem like your own little playground. This may be partially due to how constrained the world is. You can wander around streets, and inbetween buildings, and even inside of some, but the world is not as open as I would have liked it to be. Just don't be fooled by how big the map is, as lots of areas can not be accessed outside, due to barriers. Regardless, it is still a pretty big world. Just not ripe for exploration. Hopefully this gets remedied in the sequel. As for action gameplay, its nice. You won't find yourself using guns often, but when you do, the cover system is decent, and aiming is not too bad. You even get a few max payne style moves, like slo-mo diving thrown in the mix. The star of the combat however would be the hand to hand stuff, which is reminiscent of the Batman Arkham games. You will not be one on one most of the time, but rather one on many. Weaving in and out, doing parries, and a number of nicely animated kicks, punches, and grapples with ease. It's almost like poetry to see it in motion. When you are running from cops, or chasing down the enemy, you'll also find that Wei Shen is a good master of parkour. You don't have a jump button sadly to just jump whenever, but instead the parkour is tied to platforms and obstacles. So you run up to a wall, and Wei Shen will run up and grab a ledge when hit the proper button. He can jump over gaps, slide over obstacles like cars and tables, and more. Again, this is quite nice to see in action.As for the audio, it's fantastic. You have a nice selection of radio stations, featuring both HK Eastern and Western themed stations, full of commercials, and great music. You also have some amazingly done voice acting, helping to bring the story to life, with a cast of seasoned voice actors and tv and movie stars. The voice acting is also a mix of english and cantonese. Mostly english spoken, but a bit of cantonese here and there for authenticity. Some characters will also only speak in cantonese. While pedestrians will almost always speak in english. But the accents are just right even when spoken in english. Sleeping Dogs may not be the ticket for anyone wanting a true sandbox open world game, but for those starving for a good action game with an open world set piece, and a great story. Sleeping Dogs is the perfect fix.  ",2688,1008,120,316,352,31,452

												After 46 hours gameplay and 100% completed game achievement, i need to say this game is pure gold.Even though people says its like Grand Theft Auto so thats why this game is just ""boring copy"", they think.This game doesnt need to be ""Grand Theft Auto killer"" to be fun and exciting to play. Story of the game is wonderful and so exciting and intense to watch, so much story line tricks and turn-ups. Game focus on to chinese open world place called ""Hongkong"" as based to real-life city of China. Driving system of game is pretty contradictory. Cars, motorbikes & boats. Nothing special, but nothing to lame. What makes the game unique is it's fighting system. Easy to learn and fun to do. Story & game itself use's more fighting than guns and i think its good choice because its different way when comparing other games. And of course game uses melee & firing weapons, not very much of them (in my opinion) but its understandable because of the fighting system of the game.        Graphics are beautiful when you download free ""High-Resolution graphics"" from steam store. It makes game more beautiful.Game contains sidequests, collectibles and minigames. Vehicle stores, clothes stores, food markets, parkour tracks and even karaoke bars!+Story(line)+Chinese atmosphere+Cool and beautiful looking chinese Hongkong+Fighting system+Sidequests, collectibles and exploring adds more to do-Confusing Driving system-Scumbag AI-Most of storyline quests are too easy-""Side stuff"" is in many places one-sided9/10 One of the best games ever what i have playedGreetings from finland, i have so bad english :D			",106,12,9,13,16,1,9

												What was once shelved and left for dead by Activision is given new life and what would have been the third in the True Crime series is now Sleeping Dogs, exceeding expectations of just about everyone but Square Enix, the new publisher.Sleeping Dogs is an open world action-adventure(sandbox) game that takes place in China where you play as undercover cop Wei Shen, tasked with infiltrating the Triads. The game has been compared to other games in the genre, most notably, GTA. While similar in gameplay, Sleeping Dogs is no clone. It has an interesting story that should keep you enthralled, coming up in the underworld of a criminal organization, racing across the streets of Hong Kong, shooting it out with rival gang members all while undercover for the HKPD. The gameplay is what you would expect of a game of this scale and caliber. The game will give you plenty to do and will leave you wanting more. Unfortunately, the DLC doesn't quite fill that need.* You can play with either Keyboard and Mouse or plug in a controller. I tried both input methods and found both options to be enjoyable. Thankfully, that means the choice up to your preference. Pros: +Very fun+Good story+Solid gameplayCons: -Story is a bit short.-DLC is lacklusterOverall rating: 8/10			",309,43,8,23,15,5,21

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Sleeping Dogs Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Sandbox; Action; Third-Person; Martial Arts; Open World; Adult My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 25-55 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWWhy do you not have a pork bun in your hand?Seriously though, this game is amazing.  It brings nothing particularly innovative or special to the genre of open-world-mayhem sandbox gaming, but what it does offer is high-quality, exciting gameplay and a well-written narrative. Sleeping Dogs is a worthy pick-up for any fans of the genre looking for something new.You can’t fly jets, grapple-hook atop buildings, drive a tank down a city street, or do some of the other extreme actions that are becoming common in the genre. Sleeping Dogs is more grounded in reality and focuses more on having a believable narrative and atmosphere.  That said, the gameplay is still very enjoyable and there is plenty of extra stuff to do besides playing through the main story. Furthermore, the simple fact it takes place in Hong Kong goes a long way to add a little unique novelty  to the experience (like driving on the left side of the road, entering cars from the right, and just exploring a virtual city that isn't supposed to be in America for once).It has a well-written story that is quite engaging and is reinforced with decent voice acting.  Combined with the nice graphics and atmospheric gameworld, it results in an excellent overall presentation. It definitely is an experience that feels more authentic than some of the more ridiculous games in the genre.   I definitely recommend to any fan of the genre who is looking for some novelty that they check out this game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",488,241,24,56,32,8,71

												---PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY THE COMPLETE PACKAGE/ALL DLC---I enjoyed this game when I first bought it new, but never got a chance to finish it. I came back to it and recently bought it again because it was on steam sale. My only complaint is the DLC. PLEASE, be careful and read what the DLCs are and what they give you. Buying the complete DLC package is totally game-breaking. It really hurts my enjoyability of the game because it's way too easy to play now. Here's some things you should avoid the DLC because:Right out of the tutorial/first few starter missions, you become level 8/10 on triad and cop. Face is I believe 7. You gain more XP from everything.You are level 10 (max) in everything by the time you get to the mission that gives you the impounded car (Race Scene mission). Not to mention that the DLC gives you about a dozen cars already before then.You begin the game with $200,000 in your pocket. One of my best memories of this game is how hard it was to hustle to get money, and how rewarding it was to afford the things you want. Now, before I even get the first starter car, I can afford every car in the game practically.You receive a lot more money from everything. You will start receiving at least $5,000 from every short mission. $5,000 used to be a lot, now it's chump change with the DLC.You receive outfits with overpowered stat bonuses. One outfit gives you 60% reduction from all melee damage taken. That makes sense, right? Another outfit (Super Swat) reduces ALL incoming damage by  50%. That is rediculous, even for late game. Some outfits (like the deus ex outfit) even give you guns. Equip the deus ex, agent 47 or any of those outfits and it gives you the fitting weapons (flechette rifle for sarif armor, silenced pistol for agent 47 suit).You will already own all player homes. I didn't figure this one out until it was too late. I was freeroaming looking for drug busts when I came up on one of the best player homes you can get, the mansion. It was unlocked. I could use it. It was my home already, it even marked it on the map. There will be absolutely nothing to work for. You get all the free guns, clothes, houses, cars and even money you will need. I currently have about $600,000 and I haven't even gotten to the part where wei is kidnapped.There are more reasons to avoid some of the DLCs than this. Now, I'm not saying that ALL the dlc are bad. A lot are fun, actually. I enjoy a lot of the ones that add content to the game. However, a lot of them are WAY too game breaking.DLC YOU SHOULD AVOID:High Roller Pack (near infinite money, best car. It gives you a nice suit but that's not very important)The Red Envelope Pack (It adds 20 packages for $50,000 at each Parking Garage in the freeroam world, totalling one million dollars you can get in 10 minutes of driving)Top Dog Gold/Silver Pack (INSTANTLY gives you a ton of XP in all fields, makes you near max level at beginning of the game)Square Enix Characters Pack (I do enjoy this pack, but it is something I must warn you about. Gives you deus ex and agent 47 outfits, which come with overpowered outfit bonuses and free guns)Retro Triad Bundle (The outfit this pack gives you makes you do more damage, gain more triad and face XP, and gives you more melee damage resistence. Overpowered)Movie Masters Pack (Added this purely because of the Bronze Warrior outfit it gives you. It looks cool, but it's unlore friendly and gives you 60% resistence to melee damage which is overpowered)I hope this review helped you a bit. Now, I'd like to mention again, these DLCs are fun. They add more opportunities for replay and freeroaming. However, you should avoid getting these if it is your first time playing the game, it honestly ruined most of the fun for me since I was way overpowered at the beginning of the game. The fact that this (mostly) singleplayer game is basically Pay-to-Win makes it deserve my downvote. I hate that I can't love this game, it's one of my favorites, but I must warn you how game breaking the DLC is.			",155,18,6,18,16,3,9

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Sleeping Dogs 

			Views: 1,625		

			Sleeping Dogs' development cycle had some bumps along the road, in spite of all the hardships was this old dog able to learn some new tricks?		

Fans of film directors like Johnnie To, Ringo Lam and John Woo will feel right at home in Sleeping Dogs. You take control of Wei Shen, a Hong Kong native who has just returned home after spending some time in the United States. He is working as an undercover cop under superintendent Thomas Pendrew and his handler Raymond Mak in an effort to take down a powerful Triad gang known as the Sun On Yee. Wei's assignment positions him as a lowly thug under the wing of a 'roided out hothead named Winston Chu and follows his ascension to a prominent figure within the Sun On Yee. Things become complicated however, as the line between undercover cop and criminal blurs. Wei becomes deeply entrenched in the criminal underworld, building friendships with his gang-mates while witnessing signs of corruption within the police force. The yarn spun by Sleeping Dogs is solid enough but it's telling stumbles. Pacing is all over the place, and many important elements seem undercooked. Sleeping dogs has issues integrating plot points into missions and providing build up. For example, Winston has a fiancee that is revealed when you have to run a few errands for her as part of a mission. She softens Winston's image and makes him a little more human but, unfortunately she exits the plot just as abruptly as she shows up making her little more than a tool to develop Winston. Thankfully the finale builds in a satisfying way and there are some sections that are really effective and engaging in the middle portion of the tale. Its just a shame that it couldn't be more consistent and better developed. Being an undercover cop Wei must straddle the line between right and wrong and missions reflect this. Good guy Wei finds time between running errands for the triad to assist a police inspector with some of her cases. Triad missions are strait forward affairs that usually involve collecting protection money, stealing stuff, beating the hell out of other gang members and maybe shooting a few people. Cop cases play out more like multi-stage quest chains commonly associated with RPGs. Wei also earns experience for both a cop skill tree and a triad skill tree. You earn both types of experience in both mission types but being a public menace and destroying public property or killing civilians will take away from the cop experience you can earn in a mission. Throughout the course of Sleeping Dogs Wei hacks cameras, races, sings karaoke, cracks combination locks, plants bugs, triangulates cellphone calls, bets on♥♥♥♥♥♥fights, plays mahjong poker and picks locks. The game does a great job of mixing these elements up and missions are generally interesting with only a few lame ducks.  All of the aforementioned elements are secondary to the driving, fighting and shooting you will be doing to make your way through the game. The fighting system in this game really shines. Wei relies on strikes, grapples and counters to dispatch his foes. Enemies come in varieties as well, some specialize in strikes and block many of your attacks, grapplers are burly chaps that you want to keep at bay with power strikes, some enemies wield knives and tire irons and later in the game you will find enemies that are really only susceptible to counters. If you want to live in Sleeping Dogs, you will have to prioritize your foes and time your attacks carefully. Your wushu can be supplemented by finding Jade statues that can be returned to the Kung Fu master in the game. These moves are valuable tools and you will find yourself utilizing most of them. They allow you to snap your opponents limbs, deliver powerful blows and disarm your foes. It's a great system and is evolves enough during the course of the game to remain engaging. Driving is similar to other open world games with cars that handle differently based on weight and size. The one unique addition to the driving mechanics is a button that allows you to throw the car sideways by pushing the appropriate button or key and moving in the direction you wish to go. This allows you to ram vehicles that are in hot pursuit of Wei. Motorcycles, scooters and boats are also among the vehicles you will pilot. Shooting is of the cover-based variety and Wei can vault from cover and enter slow motion as well as blind fire. It's solid but the mechanics are not as unique and engaging as the hand to hand combat. In light of this most of the game focuses on hand to hand confrontations.  Sleeping Dogs' interpretation of Hong Kong is an efficiently constructed playground. There is an unusual amount of verticality in this game despite the lack of air vehicles. Wei can climb the ledges and scaffolding around a number of the building and access rooftops. Pedestrian overpasses on the streets also provide access to high places in which numerous collectables are tucked away. Free running is also a part of Sleeping Dogs' bag of tricks. At certain points Wei will have to pursue targets on foot through a gauntlet of barriers and other impediments. These sections involve the player running after them and timing button presses to clear obstacles gracefully, poor timing results in fumbling over an obstacle and loosing ground. The animations for these sections don't flow together as smoothly as those in Assassin's Creed but the extra input required to complete them is a welcome addition that adds a small layer of interactivity in what is usually a passive experience in other games. It's just a shame that the camera is not exactly stellar. It seems to have a knack for being in the wrong place most of the time. Strangely absent is the ability to center the camera with a button press that's so common in third person action games.  On the PC, Sleeping Dogs is a really pleasing game to look at. Square Enix has also made a high resolution texture pack available for those with decent rigs and includes some DX11 features. Hong Kong is wonderfully detailed with neon signs glowing, power lines forming webs overhead, air conditioning fans spinning on the sides of buildings, and plenty of pedestrians and traffic to make the city feel alive. Also, the game wisely uses rain to give everything a nice sheen--as it rains the wet pavement reveals reflections of neon signs and characters appear wet. The handful of interiors are also detailed and pleasing to look at. NPCs are not too detailed and are a little more robotic as a result of a low poly count and the cars are not tremendously detailed but these are technical limitations that are to be expected. The main characters however are richly detailed, making the cutscenes a treat. Skin textures are very detailed and the tattoos that adorn the bodies of the gangsters add quite a bit of character to each of them. You can also customize the clothing that Wei wears and wearing certain combinations of clothing can provide stat benefits. Cloting options are rather varied accounting for both ridiculous looks and strictly business attire.  For a game that was almost canned, Sleeping Dogs is quite impressive. The story fumbles around before ending on a strong note and the camera can be irritating but these faults are offset by great mechanics and strong visuals on the PC. Sleeping Dogs isn't ready to dethrone Grand Theft Auto as the best open world crime game but it's robust mechanics and numerous diversions make it a strong addition to the genre. It appears that Square Enix stuck gold by reviving this dead dog.			",1843,697,76,250,218,18,319

												Have you ever imagine an open world game such as GTA IV,a game where you obtain the knowledge of Kung-fu and other eastern martial arts, and a game where you find yourself working as a undercover police simultaneously?If you did so, what are you waiting to buy this game?A main story line where you work as an under cover police man in the most dangerous gang organizations in the entire world, the Chinese triads...Sleeping dogs is a game that combines the power of freedom known in the GTA game series, the use of the environment and knowledge in martial arts to unleash powerful attacks and combos known in many fighting games and most importantly, the perfectly mixed in story line of an under cover police man who will get emotionally attached by his work and the people he interacts with.But, there are few firearms available...This is true, this isn't america where everything is solved by gunfights or explosions. This is Hong Kong, where strength and skill is valued and measured in epic, pleasant hand-to-hand combats. But even despite that, the use of firearms will depend on your type of game play, and the game will satisfy that lack of weaponry, in amazing breath-taking missions as you progress in the game.Isn't Hong Kong a bad choice for a game like this?Definitely not, Hong Kong is currently one of the most wealthiest places in the world; It has everything from a deep underground gang network, a gym to practice or learn new moves after completing each task, a club for you to interact with other people and to complete other side objectives, to random optional objectives and events that will appear in-game.How are the graphics and the environment design?To begin with, the game's designers performed extensive research in Hong Kong to create an accurate portrayal of the city. Art designers spent seven days in Hong Kong, where they studied the city's environment, and took more than 20,000 photos as references for the physical environment in the game. And the result was that many reviewers praised the authenticity and charm of the city in the game.You mentioned the importance of the story line at the beginning, will this mean that after the game story line is completed, there wont be anything else to do?No, almost all side quests and task will continue to be there, and the game wont change at all in order to preserve it's longevity.Should I buy this game? and why?This game is the perfect for anyone who either likes a good detective main story line, an open world sandbox like the GTA game series, and a similar fighting system seem in many fighting genre games.I would rate this game 81 out of 100, or 4,5 out of 5,0. A masterpiece in mixing both action and adventure gaming genres into one, simply brilliant and well-balanced without looking lame, but truly epic!			",147,18,7,14,14,2,20

												Sleeping Dogs was a game I bought in Steam's 2013 Autumn Sales, after being curious about this game for a long time and being aware that looking up YouTube footage might have spoiled the story for me, this sale was a good opportunity for me to just gamble on this one.And it was jackpot for me. Having played Just Cause 2, GTA 1 to 4, Saints Row 3, L.A. Noire and countless other free roaming games, I was completely overwhelmed by how convincing Hong Kong was portrayed in Sleeping Dogs. Hong Kong, which in this review refers to the map in Sleeping Dogs, is a graphically pleasing platform that carries the player through a gritty storyline revolving around Chinese gangsters. Even though the city is small compared to most of the aforementioned free roaming city games, there is a healthy amount of detail put in every square foot of Hong Kong, making the city feel as big as it would have felt in real life. The city dynamics are downright convincing, you will encounter a large amount of variation among the residents, each with their own reason for being on the street. This, and the amounts of interaction provided for the player, is something that at the time of writing is not appreciated enough in the industry.Sleeping Dogs features oriental themed music to reinforce that atmosphere. The genre of the background music as well as the radio stations vary from hip-hop to classic, all with Chinese roots. Luckily, a great majority of the used vocabulary is English, although you may encounter a Chinese swearword here and there. This is translated in the subtitles and may seem a bit forced, if not out of place. Personally I find it understandable considering a full English or Chinese transcript would've alienated the player from the casting in this context, or otherwise not being able to follow the story at all.It's important that this appeals to the player as the emphasis of the game heavily lies on the implied Chinese gangster culture. This means that gunplay and car-craze is reduced to a minimum when compared to other games in this genre. Rather than mowing down your enemies it's more common to have to fight people barehanded, the use of several martial arts and enemies with different specialities makes this less linear than it may sound. I wouldn't go as far as calling this game less violent either, if anything, this game deserves its 18+ rating more than the others in its genre.Having that said, the mechanics of the game definitely require getting used to, luckily this is achieved through a clever tutorial that gradually increases the freedom you have while playing.To progress through the game there are countless of missions and events to participate in, and not all of these are fun to do. In fact, there's some dreadful shooter-on-rails included. Luckily this wasn't so common that it started to bother me more than I could take but these are things that make Sleeping Dogs far from perfect. It's a missed opportunity to go down in history as a classic, though looking back on what Sleeping Dogs did manage to achieve, it would be greedy to ask for much more. I already feel like a cheapskate having paid so little for what I got.I greatly enjoyed playing Sleeping Dogs and within the 25 hours I needed to finish the story it has managed to claim a place on my list of all-time favourite games.[IMPORTANT NOTE: I have played Sleeping Dogs on the highest settings and with HD textures (free DLC). This makes Hong Kong more crowded and makes everything look a lot better. I imagine this influences the experience quite a bit, so make sure to get the most out of your game.]			",116,12,7,6,17,0,15

												Not a stretch of originality to be seen, but that's okay. It's fine if you blatantly skin your gameplay inspiration from some of the best games of the last three years, so long as you pull it off like Sleeping Dogs has. Combat is a simple, not-so-fluid, homage to Rocksteady's Arkham games. Free motion like a muscular dysfunctional Assassin's Creed and for transport/driving it rips a blank page out of Square Enix's own Just Cause's manual while the narrative is your average hard boiled vice story with an American protagonist. Individually they falter, but as one game they all succeed. I enjoyed it, and maybe you will too.			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

												Being a nerd precludes me from being a gangster, which is why Sleeping Dogs is so much fun. In pure escapist terms, the game lets me renounce my mild, introverted mannerisms and embrace the violent, yet honour-bound way of life as a member of a Chinese Triad organisation. In other words, I get to assume the unfamiliar role of a bad-a$$, and guess what? I love it.As a pensive nerd, I would quietly apologise and then flee from any threatening bullies. As a righteous member of the Sun-On-Yee however, I could--and frequently would--Dim Mak  anyone, and I mean anyone, that so much as coughed near me. The combat is a lot of fun, reminiscent of the Batman: Arkham series, although not quite as fluid.The reckless abandon is invigorating when you've spent your life adhering to laws and rules. It helps that the characters and story, whilst clichéd, are likeable and intriguing. Hong Kong as a setting is also quite refreshing.Be warned, though. The game has issues starting half the time, and I was constantly verifying the game cache to play it.			",683,143,18,77,48,5,82

												Sleeping Dogs is an open world action-adventure video game developed by United Front Games and Square Enix London. The game has you infiltrating the ranks of the Triads as undercover cop Wei Shen on an island off the mainland of Hong Kong.Sleeping Dogs places a strong emphasis on hand to hand combat giving you the opportunity to unlock a wide range of different combos to be used while fighting. The combat very closely resembles that of Batman: Arkham City however doesn't feel as smooth, regardless anyone who enjoyed that series will probably enjoy this.Every now and then you will be required to use a gun, personally I think they should have just focused on Melee combat either way the guns add some extra ""action"" to the game. A cover system is also included to allow you to avoid being shot and an interesting bullet-time mechanic allows you to vault over cover and take out enemies in slow-mo.For those who like collecting stuff there is a large amount of collectable items in game to find while playing, you can also obtain several houses and dozens of clothing items, vehicles and furniture to customize your character. Sleeping Dogs also features achievements which cover all aspects of the game including DLC content so I suggest, if you care for the achievements, you also pick up the DLC so you can 100% the game. I took roughly 35-40 hours to 100% the game and should a Steam sale come up I think you should play it too!Pros+ Fantastic graphics+ Interesting story+ Plenty of content+ Enjoyable fightingCons- Controls could be better- Map could be bigger- Achievements require DLCVerdict: 8/10			",340,70,12,52,75,2,79

												Note: To see this review in its ""true"" form (Text formating,in-game pictures and such) go to http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/04/game-sleeping-dogs.htmlSleeping Dogs is a Open World combat game. it takes pages from Grand Theft Auto and Batman Arkham Asylum. While guns are a big part of Grand Theft Auto in Sleeping Dogs hand-to-hand combat is the most used weapon, with Knifes/bars coming in second. you can get guns, but not by buying them. you have to take them from the police or the elite thugs. this is the first thing about Sleeping Dogs i dislike. i would have liked to been able to buy guns at a store or something, but i understand that the games core focus is the hand-to-hand fighting.Gameplay in Sleeping Dogs is like i said very hand-to-hand combat focused but there are elements of hacking, and just like Grand Theft auto, following missions. but just because the game is focused on the hand-to-hand combat does't mean its not fun. in fact its a lot like playing Batman Arkham Asylum, but with added mechanics. you can smash people into environmental objects and watch a little animation of you beating the heck out of the poor guy. you can throw them into giant speakers, drown them in a public toilet, beat them with a public phone, and more.  Sleeping Dogs also has a strange mechanic called ""face"". Face is a lot like reputation or renown in other games. you get face for completing missions and doing other activities. the Face mechanic is at most a hamper in your quest for freedom and at least an annoyance. without the proprer level of ""Face"" you can't do certain things like buy the really cool cars. so even if you have the money you have to have the Face to get it. Cars in Sleeping Dogs are great looking and fun to drive. they are a lot better than the cars in Grand Theft Auto. and they look better than Grand Theft Auto cars. once you buy a car you can get it from any parking area in the city. the amount of cars you can have are unlimited. if you have the money and face you can have the car. unfortunately Sleeping Dogs has no car editing or customization whatsoever, other than changing the car color. the cars are everywhere on the streets and you can grab any car you want, but you can not save that car to use like in Grand Theft Auto. Sleeping Dogs is also riddled with annoying quick time events. if you get hand-cuffed QTE! if you get grabbed QTE! if you get knocked over QTE! they are everywhere in this game, and they are really a quick time event, fail to do it on time and you will pay for it. even with the QTEs sleeping dogs is fun. i just wish there weren't so many of the dang things. Sleeping dogs also has skill trees and perks. you can get upgrade yourself to get more health, easy access to weapons, or new fighting moves.The story in Sleeping Dogs is that your character Ricky Wong a would be drug dealer, is forced to become a undercover cop when he is threaten with lock up time in prison. he then must dive into a dangerous world of drug lords and turf wars. all the while working for the police to catch them. it is of course not easy. the story of Sleeping Dogs is great, while its not the best story ever it is a good story, it feels nice to be on the good side, and yet still be a kinda of ""bad guy"". and that is another great thing about the game, you can be a rouge/ends justice the means kind of guy or a good/nice cop. playing by the rules will give you more perks in the Police skill tree while being a rule breaker will give you more perks in the Criminal skill tree. one more thing that Sleeping Dogs does better is that the game runs good. remember how Grand Theft Auto crashes and lags up so often? Sleeping Dogs rarely has any of that. granted Grand Theft Auto's world is bigger that Sleeping Dog's, but at least Sleeping Dogs runs like it was made for PC. in the end i would recommend Sleeping Dogs for anyone who likes games like Grand Theft Auto,Saints Row, or Just Cause 2.

												A very good game, one of my favourites. There are marks that the developers worked hard on this title. PROS:- A clever and tough AI system that challenges you if you are new to the game- Graphics are very nice- There are alot of options in which you can candy your gameplay up (clothing, buying cars, markets etc)CONS:- As a german player you have no access to the DLCs (except of the newest one) (also the HD texture DLC)- Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition is not available for german players at all.- The cars are low-poly, you can see the edges on the roof and the details are very undetailled.I give this game a 7.5/10, since the things you can do in the game are over the top, but as a german player you have no DLCs and no Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition.

												Do you want to buy a game about criminals, but GTA is too expensive? Buy this instead! Sleeping Dogs has a same concept as GTA.  Wei Shen, hongkongnese undercover cop, has to work not only for Police, but even for Triad. My best experience in this game was learning it's basics - For someone, who played GTA or another open-world games with cars, it's hard to get used to drive the cars - steering wheel on the opposite side and opposite traffic lanes... I destroyed many cars before I got used to that. Pros++Good story+Side jobs and police cases+Activities(Karaoke, Races, Fighting...)+Good skill system (Obtaining COP and TRIAD experience)+Combat systemCons--Too short, I expected longer story-Too much poitless DLC's (The Year of the Snake and Nightmare at the North Point were good)8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It take place in ""Hong Kong"" and it is a sandbox game. You play as a undercover cop and trying to infiltrate different gangs in ""Hong Kong"". The game do just have singleplayer and NOT multiplayer!You play in 3rd person in this game, and the fighting in the game is very good and the animations are great animated. At the beginning of the game it is very much ""Hand to Hand fighting"" but leter in the game you will start to use wepons. And to travel around the map fast you can use vehicles, like cars, boats and motorbikes. But drive safe so cops don`t come after you!I think the grapicks in this game are good. And the story is more than great, and outside the main story you can play different side-missons. The side-missons contains everything from races, to action. I give this game a 8 out of 10 and are one of the best games I`ve played.So if you like sandbox games and want to play like a undercover cop this is the game for you!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. This was my ""Game of the Year"" for 2012. I genuinely believe that if this were just a tiny bit better, it could have been considered a masterpiece. Sleeping Dogs is a genuinely fun game. Controls are solid, responsive, and the game has plenty to do. Whether it's chasing down dudes from another triad with your sports car - SMG's and pistols spitting hot lead in all directions, or it's smashing a thug's head into a car door, or even slapping a hobo with a fish, this game does not stop being entertaining. There are tons of challenges for one to do - including ones such as races, illegal fighting rings, and even chicken fights.Sleeping Dogs is beautiful. The city of Hong Kong has never looked so good. At night, the neon lights glow bright, and are complimented by the game's graphical abilities. I'm not very ""tech-savvy"" (sorry to use that term), but Sleeping Dogs looks stunning, and runs well even on my somewhat old and under-powered setup.Sleeping Dogs's story is compelling. There are very few games that have made me both laugh, and become visibly upset. This is one of them. I don't usually care this much for somebody who doesn't exist. This may sound stupid, but Sleeping Dogs hits true to heart when it needs to, and it will hit hard.Go buy this game (technically, go buy the Definitive Edition, since the original version isn't available on Steam anymore).97 out of 100. Some people may think that's pretty high, but this game was a saving grace for videogames, in my opinion. So many videogames at the time were just not that great, and then this game blew my mind.Buy this game. Love this game. Review this game. Recommend this game.Welcome to Hong Kong.

												NOTE: I did not play 400+ hours of this game, it's a Steam bug that multiplied my playtime. I inquired about it but got not response from support.INTRODUCTION:Wei Shen a police officer trained in the USA, now working with the Hong Kong Police Department has been sent on a dangerous mission. To infiltrate and gather information on one of the largest and most dangerous Triad Organization in Hong Kong. Will he break under pressure or will he do his duty as one of Hong Kong's finest?PROS:+ Nice Graphics: -I like the visuals but you can clearly tell it was developed with consoles in mind. The only redeeming factor on this area is that a free high-texture DLC pack is available for download. The world is adequately populated by NPCs though at times some parts of the City does look empty. It has a day and night system as well as a weather system which adds to the game's atmosphere.+ Expansive Map: -Though not geographically accurate to the real Hong Kong, the game still provides a massive Island to explore, populated by a number of NPC citizens as well as a number of drivable vehicles. Driving and exploration on this fictional representation of Hong Kong is very fun and oddly calming.+ Interesting Combat: -The combat focuses primarily on punching people using street style Kung Fu martial arts, taking inspiration on the Batman Arkham games. Extremely violent and extremely satisfying in my opinion. This is further amplified by the fact that wearing different combination of clothing has benefits to your over all performance in hand-to-hand combat.CONS:- Very POOR Optimization: -As I said, this game was developed clearly with consoles in mind. Unexplained crashes, errors and FPS drops occur more than I would like. Not game breaking but It can be annoying and disruptive of the otherwise fluid gameplay.- Story: -Though I found it interesting and fun, it's still rather predictable and rather cliche. Even going so far as to have one (or several), ""The Godfather"" moments. My primary complaint is that there is only one ending to this game and your choices never really affects the ending which makes both ""Triad & Police points"" a bit useless outside of the combat skill tree.- Side Quest: -The game has a very good concept of side quest, offering both Police and Triad missions but they clearly weren't either finished or polished. I personally would have liked the ""Drug Bust"" missions to include proper detective work rather than have the game spoon feed who I should arrest.CONCLUSION:PRETTY GOOD. Notwithstanding the fact it's ""like GTA"", Sleeping Dogs is unique in it's own sense. The story has just the right feel to keep you interested and the gameplay offers enough action to keep you satisfied. Though it's current full price is good, I'd wait for a sale.If you want a break from the fun and mindless violence of GTA, Sleeping Dogs can provide a fresh story based alternative.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												I very highly recommend this game, particularly when it's on sale.It's one of the few games I've played in the past few years that I've had trouble putting down. It's essentially an Asian GTA, although feels a lot more arcade-y, in that it's somewhat less realistic (cars in particular control very well compared to GTA) but is arguably more straight-up fun. I don't remember too many segments where you'll have to travel long distances without anything to do, or many particularly tedious tasks.I think one criticism that some people had was that it got a bit too repetitive. I can see where they're coming from, as many of the missions are more or less ""kill this bunch of guys"". With that said, I found the combat incredibly satisfying, if not a little bit easy on the default difficulty.Have bought but haven't actually tried the DLC yet. Will probably edit this review once that's done.			",1146,480,42,159,145,13,200

												This is one of those games that's look like a generic clone of some other series, but that's a huge disservice to Sleeping Dogs.In a lot of ways, yes, it is GTA with chinese people, but everything about the world set up in this game is fantastic.Sleeping Dogs has one of the most spectacular open worlds ever made. The graphics are amazing, even by PC standards. Everything feels alive and real, like it's a world that would continue to exist after you close the game. The main story in the game is executed surprisingly well, with characters you will actually care about and a story that makes sense, and is most importantly, interesting.Instead of generic gunfights, the majority of the game uses a brawling system very similair to the Batman Arkham games, and it's much more satisfying taking down enemies this way than the standard ""shoot the bad guys"" approach. Gunplay does pop up occasionally and while it's not anything special, it works and feels decent enough.If you want to be immersed in a game's world, and want to experience more than just a run of the mill story that's an excuse to shoot people, give Sleeping Dogs a try.

												As someone who is currently living in Hong Kong and growing up watching all those hard-boiled Hong Kong action/triad movies, I must congratulate United Front Games for succeeding in capturing the feel of the city, and instilling the action and story of the movies into this game.  I was skeptical about this game since, on the outside, this game look like a shallow clone of GTA.  But once you start playing it, you would be surprised by the addictive melee combat sequences and the better than average open-world driving mechanism.  And the voice over is really top notch.Don't forget to download and enable the free high resolution texture pack, if you have the card to run it.  It will make a huge difference!

												So first of, if you live in Germany and have no way to get a version of this game that isn't cut, then don't get it. I have only played this game for about an hour and have discovered so many game breaking glitches, that it's not even funny. (Various mission not being playable, unreasonable stutters and so on) That is because the German version is still on the release version, oh and did I mention that you can't buy DLC for the german version?But, if you have a way to get an uncut copy of this game, then please go ahead and buy it. The little bit I played where the game wasn't breaking apart for a second it was awesome, nice fighting system, good car handling and good looking. ",135,8,1,33,9,1,10

												First of all I'd like to point out that I finished the game 3 times. (Twice on my console.)Anyway, Sleeping Dogs is what people nowadays call a ""GTA clone"" when in fact it's more than what GTA can normally give in terms of a: Amazing and tense lore, the morale of a cop in Gangster's job, the act of having two separate story lines from either the Triad missions between the Police Case solving missions. Sleeping Dogs as a game was amazingly enjoyable for me. The open world was fantastic, the humor was really satisfying here and there, Wei Shen as a main character is really likeable and the game really does make you feel emotion when a character dies at certein events. The combat in Sleeping Dogs really does set itself to be the main glory point of it. Simillar to the Batman Arkham franchise, the combat consists of Melee attacks and counters between attacks, the controls are only somewhat unusual from the standart open world experience but it takes not too long to get used to it. The enviroment kills like shoving someone's face into a lobster rock or a ceeling fan or destroying their face with a car door or just for simplicity shove them into a public toilet till they suffocate. The combat is not very challenging however in Sleeping Dogs, though for new players it will take time to get used to the timing of the counters and of such but with little training they can take on rival Triads with no sweat. Gun combat in Sleeping Dogs appears a bit later on in the game and eventually turns into something you often get used to. Wether it's a firefigth against rival Triads or a armed high speed chase around Hong Kong, the feel of the gun mechanics feel really satisfying, even when ammo tends to be something you'd scavange for since you can't buy weapons though you can stuff a pistol in your back pocket.. Again not really challenging but really satisfying. The story of Sleeping Dogs really sets itself as an Undercover Cop which tries to cripple a gang from the inside while also having the gang be his childhood friends...and enemies. Destined to revenge his sister's death he accepts this mission to cripple and weaken the Sun On Ye Triads while also being one himself as part of one of the gangs. The story has dramatic moments and amazing plot twists that are always rememberable. Graphichs are simply gorgeous on the PC. Having said that I can really only tell that I almost never had enough of looking at the amazing road textures and the neon signs on the streets at nigth! Game has alot of side activities like Poker Majong, street races,♥♥♥♥♥♥figths to bet on (Yes♥♥♥♥♥♥figths..) and also a battle fight club and much more! All due these amazing stuff said about this game, it does suffer from some glitches that can be frustrating at times, some of which just look really odd that to be honest I never experienced on a console. They're not horrible but they can bug you at times.All in all, Sleeping Dogs is an amazing game! By far one of my faveorites of all time! I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the standart Open World genre and also to those that are looking for a change from your typical GTA/Saints Row.I give this game a 9.7/10			",136,9,1,5,8,3,5

												Attention Steam Library Dwellers, it's time to wake up that dog that has curled up deep within your game collection. Not only does it have Steam Cards, it's also one of the surprisingly good games I've played recently. Yes, you could almost say this was a... sleeper hit. OK, so that's hopefully got the terrible puns out of the way, now we can get to the crux of the matter. Sleeping Dogs is a game that deserves your attention; while it might be a new IP name wise, it has a storied history as 'True Crime'. However, due to rising costs Activision sold the rights to Square Enix who rebranded the game as 'Sleeping Dogs'. So yes it's 'new', but it comes with the benefits and years of experience built up from the previous True Crime games - perfect!The game is an Open-World Sandbox game - think Grand Theft Auto x Saints Row. Sleeping Dogs takes what I liked about GTA and what I liked about Saints Row and manages to meld them together into a game that has it's own unique qualities too. This perfect blend comes together to form a really unique and fun sandbox experience. The story is dark, based around an undercover police officer who is trying to destablise and expose the Triad groups in Hong Kong (think Infernal Affairs); the action is fast and frantic, like a John Woo movie; while there is a very refreshing melee element thrown in. It's the melee/Martial Arts element of the game that really allows Sleeping Dogs to stand tall on it's own merits, and not avoids being labeled as 'just another GTA clone'.In fact the combat not allows this game to stand on it's own feet, but manages to propel it above GTA and Saints Row. The gunplay has refreshing, as it's not thrown down your throat at every turn and mission. Your mean weapons are fists and your fury, and melee weapons - yes melee weapons! Meat Cleavers, Swords, Batons, etc are all at your disposal, but it's the environment that will be your biggest weapon. Sure you can kick and punch through the Triad Forces like a young Bruce Lee, but it's when you turn your attentions to the walls, the fuse boxes and other nasty everyday objects that are in the world that you become a bad♥♥♥♥♥Jackie Chan. Grab the enemy and run towards the wall? Ram the guy's head into the wall. Run towards a dumpster? Throw that guy into the dumbster!! Run towards meat hooks... well I'll let you find out...I was honestly surprised at how fun the combat was, it wasn't as mindless as some GTA games where you seemingly have an arsenal of weapons to use at any given time. It wasn't as endless as Saints Row where mobs just keep coming. It had the ideal balance between mobs and user abilities. Sometimes frustratingly you notice that it's always 1v1 in melee combat, despite several other bad guys standing around waiting for you to stop being attacked by their fellow goon - yet this seemed strangely fitting for the Kung Fu/Martial Arts tribute Sleeping Dogs manages to deliver on so many levels. However, if there is a sequal it would be nice to see Square Enix throw in multi-mob counters and combat ala The Batman: Arkham series.Yet, you shouldn't dismiss the gun battles entirely either, as they're intense and just as fun. There's a nice nod to 'John Woo' with the addition of 'Slow Motion' gunplay when you vault out of cover, which can create some fantastic 'holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ moments within the game as you clear a room with headshots and 'reactions'. There are a few minor complaints I had about Sleeping Dogs, but none of them are gamebreaking and once you adapt to the game mechanics seem almost trivial. The driving can take some getting used to, and is perhaps the one area of the game that could do with a lot of TLC in any possible sequel. It's not terrible, just at times it feels as if your cars can't turn correctly, and it doesn't distract from some exciting highway chases and car chase/gun fights.Besides the Radio Stations are immense and contain some fantastic tracks to listen to and select for your driving madness.Visually the game is immense (if you download the free HD Textures map) and makes you wonder (at time of writing) why Watchdogs can't hit the same heights on PC (hopefully it will). When the rain falls and the city lights reflect on the wet film spread across the road, as you drive through the streets of Hong Kong you realise you're inside a wonderful looking gameworld. This game looks better than any GTA has managed to achieve to date on retail release. There are times when the shadows look a little goofy, and the blood splatters can almost become Splatterhouse-esque, but it doesn't distract too much from what is a wonderful looking game and world.Overall Sleeping Dogs manages to put together a great Sandbox game that pulls together infleunces from a range of sources - GTA, Saints Row, Asian Cinema. Yet, it seems to have went largely unnoticed, even 2 years after it's release I'm talking to people who haven't played the game or even heard of it. Those who have played seem to love it, and I can't blame them now that I've joined them.Sleeping Dogs will provide you with ~15 hours of gameplay, with a rich story driven experience that has a very strong combat base to carry the action along. If you're a fan of Asian Cinema then you'll be in fanboy heaven as the nods and tributes appear throughout the game. If you're not a fan of Asian Cinema then I'd like to suggest you watch the following movies either before or after playing the game: Infernal Affairs, Police Story, The Raid. Sleeping Dogs - A surprisingly good game.			",784,264,22,154,145,15,151

												This is the original game. The fighting style is so different to many open-world games. Haven't seen nothing similar, for now. The story is great, very original and interesting from the beginning to the end. The original game of Sleeping Dogs is not available anymore, but you can buy the Definitive Edition which includes extra features, like DLCs. If you have fun playing third person shooter open world games, then you need to buy this game. No failures on it. Believe it.			",228,51,8,9,20,4,17

												OverviewBack in the days Sleeping Dogs should have been the counterpart to Grand Theft Auto.Well Grand theft Auto is and will always remain a highlight. Especially in case of graphics, open world etc… but Sleeping Dogs confidents in his very own and special way. You play an undercover police officer in Hong Kong, who tried to infiltrate the local triad. There you expect to collect tasks such as collect money, to fight other gangs, kidnap some important people, to steal cars etc. Soon you will experience that the Triad seek internal changes in the balance of their leadership.  At the same time you are giving important information to your boss police). You take out some enemies before you can hack some surveillance cameras. With these cams you can watch drugs handovers, viewing the dealer and call the police to arrest him. You can also do some special missions, following some member of the triade, make hidden photos and listen to some discussions about money transfers.   In my opinion, the story is very captivating and exciting. The voice acting is good and look very authentic. Dont forget, ist not america, ist hong kong, different driving sides, freakier cars and everything is like really densely built. All quest are categorized in three different areas : - Police Area (after completing a quest you earn xp and can level up) - Triade Area (after completing a quest you earn xp and can level up) - Social Area (after completing a quest you earn xp and can level up) Many contents are comparable to Grand Theft Auto . There is a huge open world , lots of traffic , own cars (stealing, buying) , special clothing for your hero, weapons , several apartments and ancillary tasks. You can find hidden chests with money or clothing. To increase your energy, there are several shrines. To learn new fighting techniques, there are also hidden statues. These statues you can bring to your former teacher of martial arts. Afterwards he teaches you a new technique. You can train it in his fighting school. Focus of the game is the martial arts melee. Several kinds of enemies waiting for you : - Light opponents - Serious opponents - Wrestler - Enemies with weapons - Covered Opponents etc.   In addition to the main tasks that you can solve, there will be also little Quests to raise your Social Status. For example helping a woman to sink her car in the river. With those points you can buy better clothes. The clothes also allow you to earn some extra attributes (for example 5 % more damage on enemies in fights). After some time you will have enough money to buy anything, it just matters how is your current level in each area (police, triade, social). Some things you can only buy if you have a minimum level in one of the areas.  GraphicsI dont want to talk much about the graphics. Check out some screenshots, even if you dont play this game on ultra settings, it looks great. It can not exceed GTA, but it still looks good enough in my opinion.  ControlsYou can play it with both controller or keyboard. I prefer Keyboard, somehow I play most of those kind of games with mouse and keyboard. At least its much easier for me to hit targets with weapons instead of using the controller.  My conclusionIf you like GTA, then you will like this for sure. You can feel the intensity of the main character. I really like his way he speaks, the way he acts. He fits totally for this job.  If you love martial arts fightings with a mix of grand theft auto flavour, an open world, undercover action, a great story, then go and get it. I can only recommend the game. Enjoy it   Greetz     MajorKing PS: this was my first review of a game, who finds spelling errors in the text, can keep them xD			",19,0,0,2,2,1,4

												7.5/10I love that game. I love to be in it, like it's Matrix of sort. It has a beat, that goes on and on. It's full of life, really! For some points, it's bested Euphoria engine, if you know where to look. It's fighting mechanics feels even better than in Batman games! So I really can beat thugs for eternity there, it's always fresh and nice feeling.But, looking at some other points, this game tastes messed up. Story based on Hong Kong movies... just not give a hook for the most part of game progress. Some attached achievements feels very weird, like killing 50 cops for some ""rogue cop gold"". If you remember Karma from original True Crime, it's even weirder. Shooting mechanics and freerunning stuff almost always appear quite clumsy and far from natural. Driving mechs and some other game aspects just ripped from the ""Wheelman"".Then, you realise, that all in the game plot was made not quite right, probably because of some stupid focus group, playing every game like it's Carmageddon or Postal.Nonetheless, it's quite a good game. It's GTA-clon, alright, and maybe not the best of them, but smooth, good-looking (with up-to-date-graphics), and have some personal charisma. For once, you play for a good guy, and not for a blood-thirsty deadbeat. If you're up to some gta-like openworld of good quality, it's well worth a shot.			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

(For my computer information go see my profile)+Good & detailed  graphics.+You can do parkour. (Its like modern assassins creed :D in china)Cons:?

												I started playing Sleeping Dogs with a lot of skepticism, believing it'll just be another terrible ""GTA clone"".Oh how wrong I was.The driving controls are well formed, as well as having a some-what interesting story. The main hook for this game, however, is it's awesome fighting system.It may not be quite as good as the Batman: Arkham series of games, but it's fighting system is still briliant in it's own right. Think of a GTA world with a Batman: Arkham-esk fighting system.The gunplay isn't nearly as good as it's fighting system, but is still respectable and acceptable.To think, this game was originally a 'Streets of LA' title before being dropped and eventually picked up by another developer / publisher.Here's to the possibility of a Sleeping Dogs 2.In short; Regardless of it being on sale or not, it's a must-buy.

												Sleeping Dogs, What more can i say, 10/10 this open world, crime driven drama is an amazing experience I have not come across before. You play as Wei-shen, an undercover cop whom has the role of bringing down the infamous and well know Sun On Yee Triad affiliates. Through glorious and violent car-chases to all out blazing gunfights, and even lockpicking, hacking and the more suttle of detective work you experience the breadth and height of Hong Kong's underworld. You even approach romantic interest with an underlying premise of information that'll help you bring down the infamous Triads of HK. From martial arts moves reminescent of movie scenes to chasing down petty theives taking advantage of your goodnatured friendliness to help the denizens of HK this is a great game with hours of fun, missions, side quests, exploring and just being an in game cop or criminal. Outfits are varied and great, such as the ong bak themed preset, to the natural born genius Bruce Lee outfit from  ""Enter the Dragon"" this game has it all. Characters are well presented, plot is fairly limited but linear, development of the protaganist is good, with solid foundations of his motive and even his background affecting his candidacy to be an informer within the Triads. Overall 10/10 game, visuals are stunning, soundtrack is just plain breathtaking, my favourite station is ""softly"" has amongst the coolest eastern hits like ""from Xikou with love"" and ""love is heavy"". Thumbs up, and hope to see a sequel to this True Crime renamed franchise :)Rob, pleased player.			",76,2,0,7,5,0,12

Teal DeerDevelopers: United Front Games Publishers: Square Enix Initial release: Aug 2012Genre: Open World, Crime#Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationWei Shen is a cool ♥♥♥♥in catSleeping Dogs is an open world crime game based in Hong Kong. With a bit of a twist on the traditional main character; You actually play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop attempting to infiltrate the Sun on Yee, one of the leading Triads in China. Each mission is either for getting deeper undercover or for getting better leads and investigating for the police. As you can imagine, many issues arise with this situation and the story telling and voice acting is very good. Quite an enjoyable narrative indeed. Now, some people say that the combat is rather simplistic in that you are able to basically spam one move the entire game and prosper. While this is technically true, that sentiment can be extended to ALL games. The game has a rather robust combat system in that you use quick hits, heavy hits with holding combos, counters, grabs and environmental attacks. Once the combos are unlocked for example you can use X, X, X, Hold X for a 3 hit punch and roundhouse to X, Hold X to punch and low leg sweep making a real life combo that involves timing despite it's one button nature. All this is happening while countering and avoiding grapples. You can even sprint, dragon kick and stun enemies that could lead into other combos. You get out of the combat what you put in, you CAN spam but if that's all you end up doing you probably aren't that interesting of a person to talk to. The animations are fluid and visceral; the sound design and camera shakes are appropriately graphic. The combat while fluid efficiently breaks animations to give a responsive feedback to the player. There is gunplay but I don't really enjoy it to be honest, it's fine and quite functional. It certainly isn't out of place I just feel as though I could have done without it. It's also rampant with slow-mo sequences highly reminiscent of John Woo's Stanglehold.The driving is very arcade-y, very slide-y. This is also quite rampant with slow-mo sequences. It's a lot like a little known game called “Pursuit Force” on the PSP; in which you can jump off or out of vehicles and actively hijack moving cars. The mini-games whether it be, picking a lock, hacking a camera, calibrating a bug, triangulating and tracing a phone call all feel intricate, meaningful and not just sort of tacked on as one button affairs. The game also has some pretty decent DLC, the “Zodiac Tournament” being the best. Appropriately campy, some approximation of a 80's kung fu movie and what feels like a Mortal Kombat vibe. THE GIST A great open world game and decent enough alternative to GTA to make it feel new. I found an immense amount of pleasure beating thugs up which are in no short supply wearing a get up reminiscent of Marshall Law from Tekken or Fei Long from Street Fighter. Follow my curation for morePOST REVIEW RANTI actually played through this game twice now. The first I played it was years ago back when I was in tech school where I lived on a military base with no internet connection. The reason I bring this up is I actually probably have about 60 hours in this game, maybe more but none of that was documented because I was in offline mode. I used to take my laptop with a 630M in it and walk to the library on base to authenticate my credentials and head back to my dorm and get back to gaming. However, none of the achievements or time spent was documented. It would have been great to at least have some way of properly have that info retained. I realize that storing that type of info in say a text document could lead to a lot of, lets call it fraud for want of a better term but it's just a little annoying that none of that time ”exists” Anyways, just thought I'd put that bit of hopefully constructive criticism/frustration out there. I have fond memories of the rigmarole I used to go through when I didn't have proper internet.    ",1042,295,48,106,94,7,96

												Just a negative review because I am still angry at Square Enix for being so customer unfriendly. They still sell an unpatched German only version without any dlc support (not even the high res texture pack). The low violence version is the almost unpatched game with severe technical issues that were patched in the uncut version. If you release a game censored then at least support it. This is just pathetic and did not get nearly get any media coverage or even an apology by Square Enix.(In case you're thinking the German government and laws are to blame: you are wrong, the actual ""required"" self-censorship for a rating (to openly sell it and advertise it) was incredibly minimal and justifies by no means the only German text and the lack of any support. This is just another example of publishers doing terrible, customer-unfriendly business. And in case you are thinking ""why should I care, I get it uncut in Steam"", well, customers who bought the censored version are customers still and have the right to an opinion, don't they?)

												I really enjoyed this game. It's a little on the short side, but the characters were likeable, the world is immersive, and the gameplay and combat were smooth as silk. Special props to the unarmed fight scenes where you could bust out the kung-fu combos, and the gunplay that rings of a cross between John Woo-esque cover vaulting and Max Payne Bullet-time. The vehicles seemed a little tacked on, but there are racing mini-games to satisfy your inner speed freak. Speaking of mini-games, there's also a ""karaoke"" type game a la Rock Band, which while silly, was still very enjoyable.I was very much reminded of Mafia II, delving into the gritty criminal underworlds; instead of the Italian Mafia Stateside, you're working your way up the Triads ladder in Hong Kong. The story was engrossing and you're stuck in the middle of being an undercover officer while trying your damnedest to not get attached to these lovable gangsters. If you're looking for an immersive crime drama with lots of action in an open-world that hasn't really been visited, go ahead and pick up this game. It's one of my favourites and I'd have it still installed on my SSD if'n I had the space!			",151,29,2,24,14,1,50

												This is easily one of the best open world crme game i've played. Cruising through the streets of HK with some hip hop, techno and soothing pop on the radio is truly a pleasure. There isn't a ton of gunplay but the melee combat is where it shines the brightest. It feels a bit like combat in Assassin's Creed but somehow, better. You can use objects in your surrounding to perform 'environmental kills', throw a girl in your trunk and drive them around and even take a human shield! You can also learn combo attacks that are easy to master. Oh there's also the parkouring, jumping over objects, free running, climbing short walls, definetely on of the best delight. There's also the food and drinks that give you temporary boost in different stats. And also lots of collectibles which isn't easy nor hard to find. On vehicles, you can ram enemy vehicles, go into slow motion while shooting enemies, perform action hi-jack. The story is really great but i honestly think that it ended a little too quickly. In the midst of the game, you actually came to care about several characters, for example Jackie for me. To summarise you should really get this game if you don't mind the extensive use of swearing.			",54,10,4,5,5,0,2

												What an amazing game!  United Front did not pull any stops in creating a fantastic open world sandbox that incorporates all of the best features from similar games.  The game's portrayal of Hong Kong is very vibrant and believable and the NPCs are fun to interact with.  The game world looks amazing on the PC at full resolution (make sure to install the FREE HD texture pack DLC).The combat system focuses primarily on melee with some gunplay mixed in at times.  The combat system plays similar in nature to the Arkham series of games and allows for cool environmental finishers in addition to some time-slowing ""bullet-time"" when leaping from cover.  Vehicle combat is also fun with action hijacking and time-slowing effects when firing your sidearm from your vehicle.The main campaign story is very good and gripping, but also very predictable at some points.  As an undercover cop trying to infiltrate the Triad organization the game keeps making you think about your duties as a cop versus your loyalty to your ""family"".  The skill system reflects this conflict in rewarding experience as both a cop and a Triad gang member with experience being portioned based on your actions.  A very nice design feature in linking the advancement of the character to the moral implications of the story and how the player decides to play it out.And any game that uses voice acting from the legendary James Hong is great in my book!Overall if you enjoy similar games like Saints Row or the GTA series then you should love this game.  It is a very big open city with lots of activities to keep the player busy.  A very well thought out and designed game that made me feel that I was actually playing in a classic Hong Kong action film!  Sleeping Dogs is definitely among the top games I have ever played and I highly recommend.			",230,21,2,26,20,4,45

												Amazing game, absolutely worth both your time and money, and the only thing I regret is not buying the full DLC pack right away.I started out with some missions and had some conversations with a pig mask on my head that made me laugh more than it should. Then I discovered the game isn't just for laughs, although it has that in spades - the story is excellent too. I also had the pleasure of experiencing the awesome Batman: Arkham Asylum style combat in the game, including putting a guy through aquarium glass in a night club, breaking legs and arms, and just generally being a wrecking machine of a fighter. Good times, really good times. But there is more.Because there are times in the game that are not only good, they're almost transcendental.One evening, I woke up after a hard day/night before. I had some texts waiting on my phone, from both police investigators and thugs, and said to myself it was going to be alright, even though I was playing both sides. I got out of my apartment, picked up a car and started driving to my next mission. And then...I found myself just keeping on driving around the city.Time had stopped.I no longer sensed the room where my sorry gamer butt was actually sitting because I was no longer there.I'm in Hong Kong - for real. I can't stop driving. It's raining and the reflection from the neon lights in my car, the fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic music from the radio, the streets and back alleys, the people, the crowds - I'm completely immersed.And like throwing game money on pimped up outfits (that actually gives you bonuses sometimes, so they're more worth than just for ""show""), and awesome, fun, expensive cars, I'm looking forward to throw a little bit of real money on United Front again - this time to buy the whole DLC pack to continue my stay in Hong Kong. It's been a journey like nothing else and it has been the best digital vacation ever.Recommended with all my heart - it rivals some of the best games I have ever played in my life.

												A truly fantastic open world action game set in the refreshingly colorful city of Hong Kong. You play the role of an undercover cop trying to take down a notorious group of Triads. The story is something to take note as there is no simple good cop / bad criminal side to it. The game does a fantastic job of showing you the side of what it means to be part of a Triad family and that the police isn't necessarily the enemy here, nor are the Triads. Doing missions and assignments for both sides will test your moral standings and alignment. The story is good enough and has enough twists and turns to make you stay interested in finding out what happens at the end.Gameplay wise, you will primarily be falcon punching your enemies or killing them with your horrible karaoke singing skills. The game does include guns but is primarily fighting focused. As per open world style, you can drive around the city looking for stuff to do. Options include but not limited to: driving for fun,♥♥♥♥♥♥fighting, dating, looking for shrines of health, delivering vehicles, participating in street races, learning fighting moves, hacking street cameras, karaoke, beating down groups of gangs, eating pork meat, drinking herbal tea, getting an erotic massage, buying clothes, yachting and I've probably missed half of the others.So if you're in it for fighting, the drama of becoming a Triad gang member, the colorful Hong Kong city lights or just want to listen to some fantastic Chinese radio stations - be sure to pick up Sleeping Dogs, you will not be sorry.

This game mixes best parts from well-known asian action movies (fighting, shooting, car chasing, free-running, etc), and it is made in own style so it does not even look like GTA-clone, it feels (for me) very stand-alone and original. So yeah, crime-fighting feels true.			",246,7,5,12,10,2,22

												I finally finished Sleeping Dogs yesterday and I have to say I really like the game. Nice story mode (watch Hong-Kong movie Infernal Affairs for more in-depth look on Triad) which was pretty intense, interesting side missions (still didn't finish them all), amazing graphics (especially on rainy nights), excellent sound and soundtrack. United Front Games and Square Enix didn't dissapoint.Combat system is interesting and takes some time to used to, but when you master all kung-fu moves you'll be unstoppable (gather Jade statues as soon as you can cause it will greatly boost your performance in combat). Well, throughout the game, no matter how good you are, patience will be your biggest friend when fighting a group of mobs. :)Don't forget to download High Resolution Texture Pack (free DLC) which will really bring the game to higher level. Also, if you're lazy, you can purchase Top Dog Silver Pack (1,49€) and Top Dog Gold Pack (2,49€) for a quick XP boost, which will instantly give you many skillpoints to enhance your abilities and access to many wardrobe options.Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. It's a fun open world third person action game in the asian setting which does have some weaknesses (missions are sometimes repetative; chase enemy - kill enemy) but, all in all, it a fun game and I don't think you'll regret it. It should be available on Steam sales for a nice price (I got it for cca 6€ a few months ago) so keep it on radar. Graphics:  ★★★★☆ Sound:  ★★★★☆ Gameplay:  ★★★★★ Music:  ★★★★☆   Overall:  ★★★★☆ ",653,222,20,98,70,4,151

												Less ""GTA Hong Kong"" and more the spiritual successor to Red Dead Redemption, Sleeping Dogs borrows a lot of ideas from other games (bullet time from Max Payne and the combat system of the Batman Arkham series spring to mind), but combines them in a very enjoyable way.

												Shemue meets Grand Theft Auto. Love this game more than the aforementioned two. I didnt care much for the side missions but the main quest line was really something. I actually felt like i was torn between my duty and my loyalty to my ""friends"". Its quite a meaty campaign as well you wont be finishing it under 20 hours. Apparently it had performance issues at launch, i can confirm as of 21/8/15 that there are zero issues. I didnt have a single crash/glitch or bug. Was very smooth if only all ports could be like this one. Stay safe Officer Wei shen.			",248,42,2,51,18,3,47

												Sleeping Dogs has you play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop with a dark past, trying to crack the Sun On Yee, a powerful triad force controlling the underground of Hong Kong.Sleeping Dogs is beautiful and awesome. The story is superb and entertaining, with hugely comedic elements, but drawing brilliantly on dramatic storytelling where appropriate. The journey of Wei Shen is a tumultuous one, and it's awesome to be there at every step.Along with completing missions for the Triads, you have the Police case sub-missions, carjacking missions, extortion missions, drug busts, hacking and tonnes of random world events to keep you entertained.It took me 31 hours to 100% the game (Cheif Inspector achievement, including all other achievements (except 30/30 Silver/Gold stats)) and I enjoyed every minute of it.Keep in mind: play with the HD texture pack if you can (check DLC, it's free), makes the game look so much better. And, play with a controller. So nice. Brilliant game.-Nilesy			",313,139,3,47,47,5,46

												I picked up a CD with this game on sale a couple months ago and decided to try the game only now. If it wasn't a sale, won't even look at it. I thought the game was some third-grade GTA wannabe and wasn't expecting much. I was mistaken.Sleeping Dogs is best GTA clone I've seen, period. Cool setting and atmosphere, decent story and missions (cutscenes, too), interesting collectables, nice soundtrack and awesome gameplay improvements, the biggest of whose is unarmed fight system with a feel of fighting games to it. There's also vehicle ramming mechanics, GPS, taxi fast-travel system, various character upgrades, side missions, parkour mechanics, cover system, and much more. Graphics are stylish and overall performance is good.8/10, liked the game. Would play again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs isn't a game that does one thing perfect, but it's a game that does a lot of things incredibly well. The amount of effort that United Front Games put into development is shown from start to finish and the overall charm outshines that of any other sandbox game currently on the market. To help explain, the team spent weeks in Hong Kong taking pictures (20,000+) and recording audio to help their efforts in recreating the city. The world feels realistic and everything you encounter has personality. There was also extra work put into making it fully optimized for PC, fluid keyboard and mouse controls, specialized hardware support, and a day one high resolution texture pack to accommodate players with better machines are some of the few.The game offers a nice mix of cop and Triad missions that help the pace of the overarching story, but there are plenty of things to keep you busy for the collector and completionist mind. Featuring a surprisingly well-driven narrative (... for a video game) centered around melee combat and parkour, there are also racing events, random jobs, fighting rings, hidden lockboxes, car deliveries, cockfights, gambling dens, dates (lol), and enough cars and clothes to collect to feel satisfied. Every character is fleshed out and feels real, the city is beautiful, and the soundtrack complements the themes and overall immersion very well.After having owned the game since launch, it remains of one of the few that I still like to revisit every now and again. It's fun, it's cheap, and it deserves a spot in everyone's Steam library. Give it a shot if it's still sitting there with zero hours played and get hyped for Triad Wars.Word of caution: You might be better off without the DLC for the first playthrough, as it gives you in-game experience that will unlock upgrades early on. It takes away most progression and is something to be wary of.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't know exactly why, but I fell in love in this game. It's certainly underrated, due to its graphical glitches, but it sucked me in for long like no other ""guns'n'races"" sandbox ever managed to. It's probably the sum of many elements contributing to the ultimate Hong Kong mood: smart mafia/triads plot, merged with three-way development system, Cantonese inserts in dialogues, local soundtrack, martial arts, karaoke, sport bikes, and of course creepy chinese snacks from tiny food booths. Diving into it may get dangerous, since you'll inevitably get into the habit of left-hand driving.			",488,179,7,48,55,2,75

												Sleeping Dogs is Open world game..

The game have amazing textures and graphics and you can always upgrade your skills when you found some status all over the map.. I have played on that game once and cant stop .. even finish it thought and now I want to finish it again.That game reminds me a lot of good games that I liked to play as :GTA, Mafia and Saints row.. well on each game have there cons too on this one we can say the one of the big cons is that your health cant resotre as on each other game and if you want to resotre it you need to buy something to restore it .. well there are more but I think better say the pros on that game instand the cons..Don't forget to have fun- worth the money :)			",460,122,18,49,47,9,65

												That's what worries me, Wei. You're one of them.......Sleeping Dogs was supposed to be part of the ""True Crime"" franchise but instead went solo after Square Enix bought the publishing rights. In my opinion, this game deserves way more recognition.You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop whose mission is to take down the Triads residing in Hong Kong. You'll uncover the power, corruption, secrets behind the gangs and know what it means to be Sun On Yee.Story is a bit cliched in my opinion but is still very well executed. The character development is a bit weak, since I didn't actually feel any real, deep connections with the characters but the voice acting is honestly one of the best I've ever heard.The visuals of this game is just wow, plus with the Hi-res texture pack, everything looks much clearer. Hong Kong is a bright vibrant place full of things to explore and people to kill. I live in a place where the environment is pretty much similar to Hong Kong so that's a plus xD I didn't really enjoy the music that much as you'll be focusing more on the action/driving/shooting.The gameplay mechanics is the strongest point in Sleeping Dogs. It's like the Arkham series..... in an open-world-sandbox-type of game. Enemies are tough in the beginning, but you'll earn upgrades and moves that'll eventually make you untouchable ^_^ Guns are a rarity, since melee combat is its focus. Driving will take some time getting used to, it's very weird when you're driving slow and the camera angles don't really help, but when you're going fast, it's smooth and responsive.Overall Experience: I love this game, but it could've been better. I've experienced lots of flaws in the game such as cutscenes  not loading, game crashing on startup, GPS keeps on redirecting me, cars launching to space etc. Despite all of these errors, the game is very well-made and is pretty solid for most of the time. Plus there are cameras to hack, hidden loots to find, altars to upgrade health, gangs to eliminate, statues to recover, songs to sing, toilets to♥♥♥♥♥♥in, people to kidnap and loads of other stuff to do in this game.... It'll keep you busy for hours xD I very much recommend this game especially if you love the open-world genre.			",205,35,8,24,19,1,21

""YOU'RE A COP. I'M AN UNDERCOVER COP.""Sleeping Dogs nominated GOTY for 2012, didn't win, but still deserved at least nomination.Big plus goes for the story. It's actually more gripping for me than any of GTA series so far for example. It's like a good movie - full of great moments, action, and few emotion scenes. Basically great Yakuza story. It took me about 18 hours to finish whole game which's really long time, and additional 20 hours for completing it to 100% (And still ain't got all achievements :( A lot of times I thought it's just end of the story, but good for me, it wasn't, and long way forward awaited.  And here comes the question what's better - fists or weapons.. Of course fists and by this, I gotta mind that fighting system is really awesome. Camera in fights never flew away or something like that. Doing enviromental kills is great fun, I'd say also very important part of the game. Covering is not so good at all, but as I said, primary, players should use fists more than weapons (Gold Deagle :3You can buy furniture to your houses if you find seller at secret locations. You can buy cars to your garage. You can even bet money on cockfights. Some advanced GTA sh*t right?DLC -Besides the game rating, it's important to mind DLC's. There's 25 DLC's, those which give you some in-game bonuses such as money, clothes, cars and stuff like that I won't mention. I'll mention only 3 - Nightmare in North Point, Year of the Snake and Wheels of Fury.First two are story filled but without previous story connection. They provides 10 achievements (5 and 5). Story of in NiNP is so stupid, that it ain't even worth to talk about. 3 types of some ""magic"" enemies, empty town and one magic sword. My godness what kind of bshit is that.Year of the Snake is pretty much better than NiNP. My personal feeling is, that it was prequel of police career of Wei Shen. More packed action than in main story, but defeat of cultist ? Oh come on.Wheels of Fury contains less than 10 missions which point was to build hyper-car. I mentioned this because of fast look of it, enjoyment of the car, and additional rampage with it. Connected with main story means another rampage against Triads.Bonus Point: Wei ShenRating: 8/10------------------------------------------------------Sleeping Dogs - 8/10Nightmare in North Point - 1/10Year of the Snake - 6/10Wheels of Fury - 5/10			",95,13,6,7,12,1,6

												Wonderful game. Looks like GTA and Yakuza had a child and it’s turned out to be awesome.Sleeping dogs owns GTA4 in every way. I was forcing myself to finish GTA4 and enjoyed Sleeping dogs twice (on PS3 and after couple of years on Steam) and even collected all the achievements.Firstly the graphics are much better, GTA4 looks like crap and sleeping dogs looks great and when it’s start to rain it looks amazing. Sleeping dogs runs much MUCH better too while GTA4 is barely playable and bad looking even on high end machines.The gameplay is much more fun than broken GTA4, where controls are pathetic, shooting is frustrating, cars are bouncing, etc. This is not existent in Sleeping dogs. Controls are really good except for some rare camera issues. Driving is fun, especially shooting while driving and hijacking. And shooting mechanics is great, it’s easy to target the enemy, shoot him in the head, hide behind cover or disarm the enemy.The fighting system, is something like Yakuza. There are some combos which you learn by levelling up, you can use environment and knives, cleavers or even umbrellas, purses and my favourite – a fish to kill people. Side missions are not boring unlike in some other games, most of them are different every time. Catching the thieves, throwing out the drunks from the shop, collecting debts, stealing cars or find the lady in a car’s trunk and free her only to find out that it’s some sexual game and she was waiting for her husband to find her, not you.The story is good too. As undercover cop you must infiltrate the triad and bring them down. So you play as a cop and as a gangster depending on the mission. Sometimes it’s just driving, sometimes fighting or some bloody shootout.Oh and the game have radio with a different genre of music. My favourite is roadrunner records station. It has such bands like Machine head, Dream theatre, Soulfly and Trivium. It’s really fun to kick some teeth while Fear factory’s edgecrusher is playing :) The only downside of this game for me is that it lacks activities. After playing Yakuza games which has a bunch of activities I want more of them in other games too. The only activities are♥♥♥♥♥♥fights, races and mah-jong. Because of this I’m giving this game 9/10 :) ",701,392,38,103,109,5,116

												At one point in Sleeping Dogs I drowned a man in a toilet filled with his own urine after burning his friend's face off with a stove (Vic Mackey would be proud) and throwing another onto a table saw. While playing an undercover cop. These were just a few of the many contextual environmental attacks possible, and some of the less extreme ones at that.Excellent game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never bought this game on release because I don't like action/fighting titles - or any game that requires gamepad gymnastics, but having read about the game's Hong Kong open-world, I picked it up in the summer sales, and wow, what a game!Combat is mostly martial arts and is fairly easy going for controllerphobes like me.  The Hong Kong world is fantastic, very atmospheric and way too vast to explore!  There are many optional side missions and two story strands to play (a gangland member and an under-cover cop) that are played side by side.  Some of the minor NPCs are a bit cliched and stereo-typed (to the point I cringe) but stronger characters are developed well.A very enjoyable game for anyone who enjoys mission-based antics in a highly detailed and atmospheric world, with a good story to go with it.  The only negative is that all the accompanying DLC levels you up almost to max so there's nothing to work up towards (I learnt this too late), but otherwise it's a fantastic experience.

												Hm.. a nice new themed Hong Kong city roaming game. With Wei Shen as protagonist, offers an interesting storyline. Graphic is  nicely done (even offers quite nice rainy day) and audio also incredible.Offers a kung-fu fighting style with upgrades for each collectibles you found, tough other might say that the fighting control is bad (it's actually really simple). Gunfights also offers slow-motion features but not so many firearms type provided. Driving is easy :) too bad I can't do crazy driving like in GTA III/IVOverall it's great game. Hope there's a continuation in this game and I expect much more improved one!4.5/5 ",558,186,19,79,55,5,118

												Sleeping Dogs is the heartwarming tale of Wei Shen, a young man who must find his sense of identity in the busy city of Hong Kong.Suggested DLC for the game would be Year of the Snake, Wheels of Fury, Zodiac Tournament, and Nightmare in North Point.Anything else is alright, but avoid the ""top dog"" pack, as it actively detracts from the experience.

Gameplay:Similar to the styles of Grand Theft Auto and the Saints Row series, this game is a visual impact of what gang life would be like on the streets if there was an exaggeration on the realism. Allegedly being trained in a kung-fu training school at your home town of Old Prosperity in Hong Kong, you’re equipped with martial arts and the ability to smoothly defeat any enemy you come across with ease. As much as this fighting style is fun and easily playable, it does leave little challenge and it would be better if enemies were faster or even if more bunched on you at the same time – similar to that of the Batman: Arkham series. The whole customization scheme is great for your player, buying clothes and the DLC packs that allow more custom outfits. However, I would love it if Square Enix put emphasis on the customization on the character himself (Wei Shen) and allow you to maybe change his looks a little bit e.g. his hairstyle. In addition, a positive feature would to allow vehicle customization, not to the extent of Saints Row where it almost seems tacky, but maybe the addition of NOS or bulletproof windows etc (seeing as you are an undercover cop). The map is easily explorable but can feel a bit repetitive or leave you with the feeling that more could be added.Graphics:I actually love the graphics on this game, even though some improvement could be made. The graphics do seem quite decent in my opinion; although the problem I seem to find with them is that everything seems to be a little too reflective or edgy. Although this seems really picky, these factors are highly noticeable and can become a little bit of a nuisance – especially to those struck with OCD! I think for a sequel the graphics should definitely be improved to the quality of more recent games to make it seem like a more scrutinised game: if that’s even the correct term for it.Controls & Movement:As previously mentioned, the combat style is really playable with this game with the only problem being that the techniques – although look rather good  - are really simple to complete; this leaves the game drought of challenge at times. Staying positive however, this game’s combat is definitely more advanced than games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row and the most similar game style is the Batman: Arkham series however that has a little more complexity: with combos at a more developed stage. If the next Sleeping Dogs (or True Crime) took a shining to this then they could make the game a percentage better than it already is. The main fixture they should improve though is the gun system, as much as I love the slow-motion action scheme sometimes, I would like it if you could store guns and/or aim with a bit more ease.Storyline:The storyline to this game is actually very, very good. I find that it’s more intellectual than most games these days and has had a lot of thought built into it. The game makes your character experience a series of feelings and emotions and different thoughts such as revenge or anger. Although you’re an undercover cop cooped into the life of a gang called the Sun-on-Yee, you actually become sucked into their life more than your police life; you’d consider yourself as one of them before calling yourself a cop. You rise through the ranks and earn your place through hard work and unthinkable tasks to have your mind played and traumatic experiences – for the character, not us. With side stories and missions you are able to take a break from all the action and lay low as a racer or simply as a civilian hanging out with some girls *cough* the girlfriend experience needs improving *cough*.Conclusion:To conclude, this game is brilliant in most aspects, not too much thought put into anything but not too little. Even if more thought could be put into some factors of the game such as combat and miscellaneous additions for example vehicle and character customization, it still seems to be intuitive with its ideas. Although being similar to other games of its genre, it manages to remain original for a sandbox game because of its great storyline and renewed gameplay style. Moreover, the game is really playable – especially with a controller – which makes it quick to learn, leaving the rest of your time to enjoy the aesthetics and unique style of play.Rating:Gameplay: [9/10]Graphics: [9/10]Controls & Movement: [9/10]Storyline: [10/10]Overall: [9/10]			",356,73,9,31,26,7,41

												Really wanted to like this, the setting is interesting, it has good famous voice actors and I love HK cinema. But this game is just a collection of bad game design issues, the driving is the worst in any sandbox game I have tried to date, the fighting is always a dull exercise in waiting for counters and trying to pull of convoluted inputs, you seem to always get points deducted, and the missions forces you to endure these issues at length. It feels like a PS2 game in execution done by a novice studio.This game was really just frustratingly boring, not at ANY TIME were I having fun, and all I'm left with is bitter buyers remorse. It's a shame, like I said, I really wanted to like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A genre that isn't really thought of as a genre but is still one of the most immensely popular genres out there is what I call the 'open world crime game'. Saints Row 4 and GTA 5 were some of 2013s most anticipated games which shows how popular the genre is. Another classic genre is the old school fighting game. As in, fighting with fists not guns. Sleeping Dogs combines these two to form an absolutely amazing game. The story is fantastic, the combat is far more interesting than in games such as GTA or Saints Row, the city (Hong Kong) is really nicely detailed, and the driving is at least as good as that of those two games.In my opinion this is the best game of the 'open world crime' genre and is among my favourite games of all time.

A Kung fu oriented combat style, it should delight fans of Hong Kong movies. It is also possible to unlock many different attacks, as well as a classic gun-fight system. You'll also find there a decent GTA-like, i'm sure it'll once again, satisfy all fans of the genre, definitely worth the price.			",234,42,12,20,18,3,28

												This game is an intense thrill ride following Wei Shen an undercover cop in Hong Kong who is inflitrating the Sun On Yee a Triad member gang. You must choose between the honor of your gang and your duty to the badge. A great plot with many shocks indeed. It is a very gruesome story that has some cringing moments.This is not like a GTA game you focus less on shoot everyone and drive away fast. You mainly use your martial arts skills to defeat foes while attempting to not put innocents in harms way. Driving recklessly will negatively affect your police skills and take away points. The game utilizes parkour in many ways such as combat, running missions, and exploration.The only real downside is that if you fail a check point your buffs just vanish and you must go through the city and get them again later. Also there were several instances of NPC clipping errors. In which during a cutscene an enemy would get stuck behind a door or circle their vechile endlessly meaning the cutscene would not end and I would have to restart from the checkpoint. Another instance is when you enter a shop and the keeper will randomly not be active for interaction, though when you walk away they are ready until you approach them again. The only way to cure that is to go around the block then try again.Overall it is a great game an open world that is not a shoot up everyone game.Also if you want to have some fun try leaving your car 1/2 in the garage then talk to the attendie your car will be damaged.

												What can be said about this game...Square Enix likes to create new stuff, and most of the time ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up: this is kinda the same thing, but not for everything.The story is pretty good and original, always full of action and never boring, and really tried to make you forget you're playing something that could looks like a GTA game.The gameplay is not that bad, pretty much a copy and paste from Batman games but with more then 2 buttons to press.The ambience is very well designed, and pretty much everything lives around you. But here comes the bad part.This game is a bucket of bugs. Lot of time I had to spend a few minutes to figure out what the heck was goin on, even in the first 10 minutes of the game. The AI is pretty stupid sometimes, and the physics is terrible, everyone looks like a robot when they falls, even the protagonist.In conclusion, Square Enix did a good job, but probably should have waited just 4-5 month before releasing it for fixing lot of bugs and not make one hundred updates about cars 'n♥♥♥♥♥♥Final score: 7/10			",488,143,14,45,39,6,32

												It all started with the Winter Sale of 2016.I bought Sleeping Dogs for 5 euros and did not expect too much because in other reviews it was called the chinese GTA. Instead of being a copy of GTA Sleeping Dogs can easily keep up with GTA 4 or even GTA 5.So, I want to give all of you a short overview of what I liked and disliked about this game.Positive:- The story was awesome. I just finished it with some of the sidequests and it took almost 30 hours. You play Wei Shen an undercover cop who moved from America to his hometown Hongkong. It is his job to infiltrate the Sun On Yee, a local gang, where he meets old friends and becomes part of their gang. Soon,he has inner conflicts whether being a good cop or being a gangster is the right decision.-  Being cop and gangster at the same time means to do jobs for both sides. So you have a huge variety of tasks. Chasing murderers, street races,drug deals and so on.- In the huge amount of sidequests you help friends, get to know girls and do delivery jobs for the gangster next door. Searching for collectible items, health upgrades and money can also give you an advantage in the main story.- The upgrade system gives you a lot of benefits. The better you do the missions, the faster you can upgrade your skills. This skills can help you in future missions.- Fighting in Sleeping Dogs is awesome but also challenging. Throughout the story it is possible to improve your move-set  which helps you fight stronger enemies and more enemies at the same time. - Sleeping Dogs has an awesome atmosphere. This may sound silly but Sleeping Dogs really creates an authentic atmosphere via graphics and music. Furthermore it has the perfect music for every taste. On the way to the missions via car, motorcycle or boat there are 7 or 8 different radio stations who make you enjoy the game even between the missions. (Chinese Instrumental, Chinese Rap Music, American Hiphop, Jazz, Rock and Metal, Classical Music and Pop Music; more than 100 songs)Negative:- There is no Multiplayer or DLCs for additional content. After finishing the story you feel kind of lost in this game.			",28,2,2,1,8,1,5

												Sleeping Dogs in many ways is just your average GTA clone. It does nothing much groundbreaking or new but manages to provide a decent open world experience that will entertain for as long as it should.You start of as Wei, an undercover police detective that's working his way into the power structure of a local triad. Of course he has a number of personal connections and vendettas that he is secretly trying to solve however the lack of choice often means you won't really get to care about his developing identity crisis.Unlike most games in this genre guns are fairly rare and you will only really use them in the missions that require it, the rest of the time you will be depending on your martial arts skills.Although the developers did quite a lot of talking up the fighting system in this game, even going as far as comparing it to the Arkham games, it doesn't quite meet that standard, you got your heavy attack and your light attack as well as a grapple and can use those in a variety of combos. Unfortunately Sleeping Dogs also takes a page from the first Assassins Creed game and gives you an end all counter button. You can win almost any fight by just standing still and countering the enemy attacks without much effort.The driving feels pretty good, not quite the cartoon style of Saints Row but not the annoying wannabe realistic style of later GTAIV either it manages to strike a nice balance where cars are still fun but it doesn't get too silly. For some bizarre reason though motorcycles have much greater road grip than even the best of cars.Instead of multi-player Sleeping Dogs have a social hub feature wherein you can compete with your friends for high scores on missions and races as well as a number of challenges but it is a feature easily forgotten or ignored.What separates Sleeping Dogs from the pack is the location. Instead of being situation in yet another differently named version of New York City the game takes place in Hong Kong and everything about the game, from the mini games to the radio stations and the street vendors create a different feel than we're used to in this sort of game. When was the last time you bet on cockfighting in a video game?Although the Hong Kong vibe manages to make Sleeping Dogs rise somewhat above the pack it is still a fairly unimpressive game underneath, not much new and not much improved over the many other games in the same genre out there now. Also it is much lighter on content than is normal for a game in this genre and 100% the game, achievements and DLC shouldn't take much more than 25-30 hours of game time.Still, it's a game I had quite a bit of fun with and the Hong Kong vibe was interesting to play around with, it's a pretty game despite originating on the consoles and although I would probably feel a little cheated if I had gotten it at it's original 50$ price tag with the current sales and discounts it's an enjoyable experience.

The storyline takes a decent amount of time to finish but It's worth it. There's alot of shooting in this game and a lot of parkour. The physics are very well made. Voice Acting is good, not the best but pretty good. There's a few sad moments in this game but not that many. Overall, I believe this game is good. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GTA Hong Kong. I believe this is the easiest way to sum up Sleeping Dogs. But it would also be incorrect as it gives you the impression that the game you are going to play will be exactly a GTA game but its setting will be a different city. That is why you should try Sleeping Dogs as it is so much more!Gameplay-wise it is exactly what the newer GTA games are: you have an open world game where you go wherever you want and you can do whatever you want. Of course, doing some hit-and-runs will only anger local police so they'll be after you pretty quickly. You can approach icons scattered throughout the game that launch missions - those that are essential to the main story progress are indicated by a different icon than those who serve to be side missions only.There are TONS of things to do in Hong Kong: you can participate in racing games, sing at karaoke parties, date girls, bet on cockfights, join a fight club. You also have hundreds of collectable items. It's worth participating in all these activities as the game rewards you with experience points that let you level up only to learn new abilities.In GTA you you had an assortment of firearms available for you to use. Here, emphasis is on hand-to-hand combat. Learning new abilities makes martials arts even better. Carjacking is also available but can happen much faster than in GTA - you can jump into vehicles and there are also car chase sequences in the game.Story-wise you play Wei Shen, an undercover cop, who climbs the criminal corporate ladder only to get closer to the bad guys he needs to expose. There are some nice surprises here and there and just like GTA this game can also steal around 40 to 50 hours from your life.A highly recommended game if you liked GTA IV or any of its third-person shooter predecessors.

												This is one of my favorite games for sure.  I love asian culture, so thats what got me interested.  This is an open-world game with racing, clothing stores, kareoke bars, fight clubs, apartments, and much more.  The music choice in the game is interesting.  There is a selection of cantonese and mandarin songs, but there are also songs from Killswitch Engage, Queen, Pat Benatar, Blood Red Shoes, Machine Head, Mozart, and plenty more.  Hand to hand combat just feels right.  Shooting an enemy may make you feel good about yourself, but there is nothing like a flying dragon kick to the face!  As you progress through the game you will learn more moves to use.  Fight clubs are a great place to try out all the moves you know, while taking on 1, 5, or even 10 enemies at once.  If that isn't enough, the story just makes it that much sweeter.  It is very easy to feel connected to characters in the game.  This is just a portion of what this game has to offer.

												If you're looking for something reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto but unique in its own right, look no further than Sleeping Dogs.  I was extremely pleased with this game.  I had expected a good time but what I ended up getting was far more bang for my buck than I had initially expected.Sleeping Dogs has gameplay similar to Grand Theft Auto in that it takes place in an open world city where you acquire missions from contacts to progress the story but you can generally do whatever your heart desires.  However, whereas Grand Theft Auto is very gunplay oriented, the majority of Sleeping Dogs' combat is melee in a way that reminds me of a kung fu action movie.  The combat is much deeper and more complex than I had anticipated (similar in a sense to the Arkham games) and the parkour movement was a nice surprise as well.  The story, I must say, is absolutely incredible.  It has its twists and turns as you play the role of an undercover police officer navigating both the criminal underworld and the police hierarchy of Hong Kong.  If I had to choose one of the aspects of that game that was the absolute best and most standout, I would go with the story.  I highly recommend this game to all fans of modern open world games, action games, and especially to anyone who's looking to scratch that Bruce Lee itch.			",622,155,2,165,79,3,130

												This game is awesome, and really underrated. I like how they optimized graphics and it looks pretty nice (hadn't such experience with GTA IV). Puzzle-hack-lockpicking minigames are good too but bit boring. Good ad solid plot, they've used pretty good tropes from criminal drama classics and i enjoyed story and plot twists.Don't know how realistically looks dark side of Chinese/Hong Kong society but i enjoyed this ""left-hand traffic"" setting, with great emotional voiceover for characters and random people and drivers on streets			",196,54,6,29,18,2,46

												From the developers who brought you ModNation Racers, a kart racing game that makes Mario Kart seem unsuitably violent for children, comes Sleeping Dogs; the brutal, ultraviolent action game you've always anticipated would rise up gallantly, to try to compete with the popular GTA franchise, only to fall short by an unsurprising stretch. Not to say it's not an entertaining game, Sleeping Dogs reaches certain standards, most of all when it comes to innovating the field of satisfying your homicidal urges. After all, its progressive skill system is based on 'Face points’ that are awarded accordingly by how creative you are on your quest: to reduce the bodies of your enemies to the least identifiable shape possible (the important thing to know about evidence is that it’s best if there is none). You get the option to use the vibrant urban environment to your advantage, being given difficult choices like whether to crush all the bones in your opponents’ bodies with easily accessible car engines, or the equally effective maneuver of putting them gently down in a trash container.The story is set in the metropolitan jungle of Hong Kong, and you have the privilege of following Wei Shen: the spiritual successor to every character Jackie Chan has ever played in films. He is an undercover cop and a master of martial arts before he even enrolls in the in-game martial arts class, and an unrelenting champion of doing the right thing. Like spending blood money on fancy clothes. Throughout Wei Shen’s journey, you will face difficult moral choices, encountering moments where you’ll have to decide whether a character or scene is merely stereotypical, inappropriately prejudice or straight up racist (for example: why it seems like every fighting individual seem to possess knowledge of, and skillfully demonstrates, advanced martial arts just because it’s set in Hong Kong).You will be taken on an adventure where, as a servant of the law, you will rise in the ranks of organized crime through vicious acts, lie to near everyone you come across, and enthusiastically murder almost every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ person that stands in your way, be it suspects, gang members or policemen, and still getting to keep your job as a cop. Oh, and you also get the option of using ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s posing as masseurs for in-game bonuses, tasteful! An excellent social commentary on how the modern execution of justice is flawed and better handled by a single, unstoppable psychopath, who also enjoys karaoke.Your toughest enemy throughout the game will be the agony of a typical, nightmarish PC port. You will be combating mortal enemies like painfully stiff controls and a swarm of bugs, along with strategically consistent game crashes to ultimately break your resolve. In addition, Square Enix’ support center seems to have lost all the passwords to all of their e-mails. A suitable challenge for only the most hardcore gamers, those who don’t really want to play at all. Final verdict: “it’s alright” out of 10. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whoever came up with the title “Sleeping Dogs” must’ve had the biggest grin on their face when the name was approved. The game was originally pitched as a completely new IP, then rebranded as a reboot of the True Crime series, then pulled back into the series as True Crime: Hong Kong, and then canceled, only to be picked up by a different publisher for another rebranding and an actual release – the sleeping dog that nobody would let lie. Given that its initial announcement was in 2009, not to mention its ties to a less-than-revered franchise (does the True Crime name really move units?), it’s easy to understand why Sleeping Dogs simply isn’t showing up on many radars – we’re practically at a micro-Duke-Nukem-Forever at this stage. However, Sleeping Dogs shouldn’t be ignored. In fact, taking its rocky road to release into account, it’s an awesome surprise.Open-world crime games aping movies are nothing new, but Sleeping Dogs nails it better than practically any other. As undercover cop Wei Shen, players will dive deep into Hong Kong’s criminal underworld, assuming the role of a Sun On Yee soldier with the intent of climbing the gang’s hierarchy and crippling it from the inside. Wei Shen has a personal vendetta against the gang, but it’s not long until his hands are as dirty as the rest of them. His loyalties to both the police and the Sun On Yee will be tried and tried again over the course of the increasingly violent story.Does it sound corny? It is, and it’s frankly the game’s most interesting aspect. Plenty of video games attempt to place a conflicted main character at their core, criminals with hearts of gold who are just doing what they have to, waxing poetic about life and death in a maudlin cutscene before the actual gameplay starts, in which the player is far more likely to see how long they can drive on the sidewalk before getting shot than they are to sit and ponder deep questions about killing, honor and redemption. Sleeping Dogs does all of that, but it’s dressed up in the wonderful melodramatic styling of a classic Hong Kong crime film. Wei Shen is angry and unhinged, the Sun On Yee are violent and feudalistic, and the police are cold-hearted and shifty. The game’s script embraces cheese and contradiction, lampshading the disconnect between story and gameplay far better than most crime games with a serious tone. Sleeping Dogs isn’t a comedy or a satire, but it knows that it’s pulpy.The action movie influence seeps into the gameplay itself, too. Sleeping Dogs focuses mainly on hand-to-hand brawling, employing a combat system that feels like a less refined version of Arkham Asylum or The Warriors. There isn’t a prominent combo counter, but there are counter moves that can be triggered as soon as an enemy flashes red – a slightly jarring visual – and some truly brutal punch-kick strings activated by tapping or holding the attack button in certain orders. It’s slightly jerky and robotic feeling, mostly due to a lack of transition animations, but it can be very satisfying. More interesting are the throws and grabs that make use of environmental hazards, which usually involve Wei Shen shoving a goon’s head into something sharp or spinning (or both). All of these attacks are straight out of Hong Kong crime films, and they are all awesome. Heck, even when there aren’t any interesting objects around to push people into, Wei Shen can still sprint full-tilt towards the nearest wall and smash the person he’s holding into the hard surface head-first.Then there’s the driving, which feels very tight and arcade-y. Cars and bikes go incredibly fast and are almost all very nimble, save for a few trucks and mopeds. The streets of Hong Kong are lots of fun to speed through when you can turn on a dime, and car chases are pretty thrilling because of it. There are a few control issues once action-hijacking and shooting are introduced, though – even though the pace slows down time a tad to help you keep track of everything, it’s often very easy to jump onto the wrong car, or pile straight into a wall while trying to shoot something behind you. However, the fact that these are all things you can do is undeniably cool, and actually jumping onto the right car, clambering across the roof, and kicking the driver out of their seat is immensely satisfying.The third major section of the action is shooting, which mostly plays out like you’d expect. There are guns, there are chest-high-walls, dudes pop out and you shoot them. It’s definitely the least remarkable pillar of the game, although there are a couple of interesting mechanics that save it from being too dull – namely, the way the game encourages you to vault over cover at enemies, rather than sticking around in one spot shooting people as they peek over their hiding spot. Sleeping Dogs employs a heavy dose of slow-mo when you complete certain actions – leaping over cover, disarming a foe – which makes clearing large groups of enemies really easy. Thankfully, on-foot shooting missions are in the minority, although there are some straightforward run-and-gun sections towards the end of the game that can get pretty dull.If only the PC version let you assign separate keys for some actions, rather than using the obviously console-oriented “press-then-release-then-press-again-really-fast” setup – I imagine a lot of the control issues would be nonexistent. With a mouse and keyboard, some of Sleeping Dogs can be a bit of a headache. Sprinting and jumping over objects requires timed presses of the same sprint key – likewise, getting ready to jump out of your car and actually jumping out of your car are two actions tied to the same key, which just feels odd with all of the options available on a keyboard. Moving Wei around can feel a little stiff, as well – thankfully, the game supports controllers without a hitch. I’d strongly recommend a gamepad.The overall package of Sleeping Dogs is helped immensely by its presentation and atmosphere. While the character models and animation aren’t great, the Hong Kong they inhabit is gorgeous. There are moments where the game practically bleeds cool – rain-soaked streets, gaudy neon lights and the bright metropolitan skyline. The voice acting is appropriately over-the-top, and the character designs get more and more sleazy-looking as Wei makes his way up the Sun On Yee. There are some great missions, too, one-offs that feel like they belong in cult crime films. One sees you sneaking into a superstitious man’s house and messing with his furniture to screw up his feng shui. There are some truly horrifying revenge killings. You can also date Emma Stone.I wonder how Sleeping Dogs would have been if it had been released in 2010 as True Crime, or 2011 as True Crime: Hong Kong. The game is a tad unpolished as it is in 2012, so clearly there were reasons to push it back. However, if the game was as charming and interesting as it is now, I have no idea why anyone would cancel the project. Sleeping Dogs is a great action game with a compellingly melodramatic story and an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife. Control issues aside, it’s a great PC port, too – on a beefy gaming PC, Sleeping Dogs looks far better than its console counterparts. For fans of Hong Kong cinema and/or open-world games, it’s a must.My Rating: 8.7/10 ",807,308,49,101,97,14,113

												If you want an outstanding open world action game with gorgeous graphics, thrilling story and a great melee combat system, then look no further. Sleeping Dogs is one of the most satisfying open world games I’ve played, as it doesn’t overstay its welcome while providing a complete experience in terms of gameplay and story. If you like open world games, don’t miss out on this one.			",166,79,0,31,4,2,25

												This was the game that was to be True Crime Hong Kong.  As sandbox entertainment it's all over the map.  Many of the employed systems leave a lot to be desired.  As a story based brawler it's among the best I've played.  High production values.  Spectacular graphics, professional voice acting and fighting system that is somewhat simplistic yet makes you feel like Bruce Lee without having to memorize a multitude of button combinations.  The story can be summed up by the quotation; ""Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss it you will land among the stars."".   It's not perfect but the entertainment value is high.  The setting is Hong Kong and the city is gloriously realized.  The story is solid with plenty of ""moments"" whose characters and writing couldn't of been done much better by Hollywood.   Play Sleeping Dogs.  You may not look at Chinese restaurants the same thereafter.			",2428,1048,114,292,316,28,430

												Yeah a great game that i really enjoy. A great town, many places with discovering objects, not to hard, not to easy (good balance maybe a bit hard for casual gamers), the control is fine, the graphics could be better, but you have most time no loading times (only buildings, new missions, loading save file). Really great game gets 90 % i wished there would be a 2nd part in development. What me ruins the game is that the german version hasnt the DCLs like Nightmare in North Point or The Year of the Snake so i need to wait with 30 years many years till they are down from the index, thats why for german achievement players i give a 6 % instead of a 86 % :(			",2545,1142,74,266,298,25,355

												This game is one of the greatest open world games I've ever played.The Storyline is awesome, the characters are awesome and you can do so many things.Story is about 10-12 hours and if you finished the story, there are still things to do like race events, find all health shrines, Face missions etc.The graphics are wonderful, too. In some moments, I just enjoyed the feeling and view of hong kong.Also, the fightings are really great too. You can learn new Martial Arts moves and fight against enemies easier. There are weapons too ( like pump gun, SMG, Pistol, Assault Rifle, Grenade Launcher etc. ) but I prefer to use melee weapons like kitchen knife, meat knife, pipeline or my blank hands.I can absolutely recommend this game.But I have to warn our germany friends... Don't buy the german version of this game !! There are no dlc's for and patch support seems to be folded ( German Version is patched on 1.5 I think and all other versions are patched on 2.1 )			",895,266,33,117,96,14,116

												If you were wondering if this was a GTA V knockoff like I was, it's not. It does follow the open world genre, but with a twist. Sleeping Dogs puts you in the role of an undercover police agent attempting to infiltrate the triad organization. The role involves taking missions involving from either the side of the police or the triads.Wei Shen is the main character in the story in which the player will control. Wei was born and raised in China but moved to America with his family. He has now returned to China as an undercover police agent infiltrating gangs. His role starts out quite easy getting initiated into the gang, but quickly heats up as a lot of his undercover work requires a lot of unethical decisions. Whether you are taking a police or triad mission, you will be docked points for causing any crimes or damages to anyone not involved. Meaning, if you cause damage to the environment (wreck-less driving or stealing cars), it will be noted into Wei's reputation. Speaking of reputation, Wei also has side missions available to increase his ""face"". Increasing the ""face"" stat will allow Wei to have more access to specialized cars. Face challenges require the player to fight gang's that can be found around the map.The overall gameplay of the game is between alright and good. The unique feature of this game certainly has to be the fighting that is involved. The game reminds me of the True Crimes series with it's fighting genre. Fighting can seem basic at first and upgrades can be added to Wei's Arsenal. There are a few types of upgrade trees to worry about : cop skill, triad skill, melee skill and face skill. You will not be given general upgrade points. Rather, the points will be given depending on which missions you take. It is important to note that if you would like to unlock certain fighting features that you will have to focus on specific areas. The fighting itself is not too bad. It is a nice addition as it makes it different from other open world games, but failed to optimize on the opportunity. There are grabbing capabilities on top of unlock-able combo's, but the player will find themselves mashing X then pressing Y quickly to counter another opponent. The flow of hitting enemies while doing counters is pretty cool to watch. That's sort of the issue though; it's more of a watching/button mashing gimmick for me than it is being creative with my fighting approach. I should highlight that the player can interact with the scenery while fighting and really do some serious damage to opponents by throwing them off railings, into vents or even into garbage cans. While the fighting is fun, it could have been a lot better.The exploring component of the game is pretty good. The environment (Hong Kong) in which the game takes place feels very nice. The conversations, radio stations, ambience and scenery really tie everything beautifully together. There are a lot of side missions to do be it fighting gangs to drug busts. Wei can hack security devices (such as cameras) and watch the city over his computer at home. These cameras are only accessible when Wei hacks into them (as they are not available by default). Small gimmicks like these do try to differentiate the game from other big open world brands. Other side missions include races, statue collection (to unlock new moves or points), and (not limited to) hit and runs. The driving itself is not the greatest but does have it's own unique system to itself. Not that it's entirely bad, but it will take some getting used to. Wei is able to stunt jump onto other cars as he is driving. Alternatively, the player may use the ""X"" button to initiate a ram maneuver. These actions definitely add depth to the game and  absolutely make it more dynamic. Paired with QTE (quick time events), it will keep you engaged.The visuals/graphics are quite stunning and can demand quite a bit from the PC. Besides the streets not being super crowded as I would imagine Hong-Kong, the map creators do a good job of creating an immersive atmosphere. The sounds are definitely remarkable as there will be conversations going on in Chinese and in English. The radio stations are very good and gives the player a new cultural insight into music. The cut-scenes are relevant and are well-received thanks to the passionate acting.Overall, the game is decent. It can definitely be a fan favorite for a few but speaking as a neutral reviewer, it is an average game. For the price it's been selling at, I would say it's certainly worth a buy on sale. The game has it's fair share of action, drama and story. I feel the actions could have been complimented with a little more to distinguish the game. For that reason I will be giving the game an average score.RATING : 7.0Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots :  ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Probably one of the most underrated games of 2012, Sleeping Dogs brings to the table an unique experience. From the interesting story, to the refreshing Kung Fu combat, every single bit of it is really enjoyable, but as every other games, it has it shortcomings.Story & SettingSleeping Dogs is a third-person, open world, action game set in modern Hong Kong. The story revolves around Wei Shen, an undercover cop from San Francisco that left Hong Kong with his family when he was young, and his journey to infiltrate in Sun On Yee , a criminal organization who is both feared and respected. The main plot line is focused on Wei`s struggle between the two worlds, between what is right and what is wrong, between law or emotions. The second plot line is focused solely on his    work in Sun On Yee, where family and respect are the most important thigs, leading to some really intense moments. GameplayThe Gameplay is the best part of the game, and what you are gonna by doing most of the time. Inspired from Batman Arkham Asylum ,but with a twist of Kung Fu, the combat is one of the most enjoyable when it comes to Open World Action Games.The mechanics are simple : You have an attack button, a counter button, a run button and a grapple button. The basic combo consist in pressing the attack button a certain amount of times, and sometimes you have to hold it to increase the power of the attack. Also, you can combine the attack with either run or grapple in order to performa even more combos. But beware, most of those will have to be bought with statues that you find in missions from the dojo.You main defence will be the counter button. Just as in Batman, when an enemy is about to attack he will flash red. If you hit the button at the right time, you will stop the attack and initiate a counterattack. Of course this does not work on all enemies, some will have to be disarmed in order to be able to counterattackOf course, as in every action game, there are gonna be guns but they are very rare, and only certain missions will have it. The gunplay is cover-based, from which you can also blind fire or jump over in slow-motion. Some of the cover is destructible, but most of it is not. Be careful though, because the enemy will come after you if you don't kill them. When in a car chase, the gunplay consists either in shooting the bad guys or in shooting their tires, resulting in an awesome slowmo scene.The biggest flaw that the combat has is that it can become a little repetitive after a while.Graphics & SoundSleeping Dogs has THE best rainy scenes and the most detailed city I have ever seen in a game. The models are very nicely detailed and textured, the city is full of things hanging or flying. The detail put in this game is absolutely amazing. Even if you can't run it maxed out, you will be able to experience the beauty that this game has.As for the sound I have to say that it is very immersive. From Traditional Chinese music, to modern club music, to some metal the game provides something for everybody. The voice acting for every single character is top notch and very authentic.ConclusionSleeping Dogs is not a perfect game, not by any stretch of the imagination, but it IS a really good game which offers a great story and characters, but also a really good combat system that is very enjoyable to watch. It is an underrated game that deserve much more than it got.			",188,42,4,26,9,2,17

												Sleeping Dogs is definitely one of the best gems on my steam account. The story is very cinematic and gripping. You follow Wei Shen who returns to Hong Kong as undercover cop to take out the triads. A bit of a cliche story line, but the animation, the characters' development and the output of the story are done really well. The only bits that were a bit weird were the scenes where Wei flirts with girls. He doesn't seem as smooth as Square Enix would have liked him to be, and instead comes across awkward and cheesy.Gameplay wise, it's a treat. Combat system is like Batman Arkham Asylum (which is always a good thing), nice shooting controls and free roaming world would definitely put many GTA games to second best. Yes, this game is a lot better than most GTA games, as it's not overly long or has many unnecessary missions as I've felt with some GTA games.Graphics are amazing, I put it on low because of my laptop power and I was still impressed.The DLC isn't a highlight, but if you can get it for cheap you might as well. But the main story is the gem. Get this game!8.75/10, would have been 9 or 10 if it wasn't for some bugs e.g. the radio playing the same song no matter which car you stole. Also the DLCs aren't amazing			",60,11,1,4,2,1,1

												Sleeping Dogs is easily one of the best open world crime sandboxes I've played in a long time. It is a nice blend of the later GTA's grittiness and realism, showing the deep dark underbelly of corruption and crime, while maintaining a slight sense of humor about it, a la Saint's Row.The gameplay isn't exactly that different from any other games of this genere, save for the combat. The melee combat (which you use a lot) is very fluid, making stringing together combos a very rewarding challenge. The somewhat limited gunplay (lampshaded in-game by saying that guns are rare in Hong Kong) is nothing to write home about, yet I still found myself enjoying the occasional gun battle.There are two things which got to me in this game: The story and the graphics. For a game two years old, the graphics blow me away, even on a medium-high setting. The story is the thing that had me hooked on the game the most. As a sufferer of gaming ADD, I found myself unable to pull away from the game!I highly recommend Sleeping Dogs, regardless of the price.			",179,25,21,19,59,4,26

												This is a decent game, it has nice graphics and gameplay. The combat is alright, you'll ecpect combat in a game like this and it's exactly what you think, kicks, punches, submissions, the whole lot and you can also use your environment to defeat your ememies which is awesome. It's a full action packed game but (MAY BE A SPOILER) I wish you could have chosen the path of a cop, fighting for good or a Triad, earning yourself loyalty and respect. The gameplay is  a good long game, 24 hours and over, but when you finish the game you get to play some minigames, cockfighting, races and many more. Sleeping Dogs does not disapoint, besides the bad stuff I said about this game, the gameplay is great with an exctiting good storyline that'll make you stay sitting on your seat, you don't get confused about what this game is about, Sleeping Dogs will still be fun even if you finish the game, you'll be playing this game for a while and the voice acting is absolutly fantastic, I suggest this game to all users it's a solid 7/10 from me, not too high, not too low, it's a good, decent game.

												I rather enjoyed my playthrough of Sleeping Dogs, a Hong Kong set entry into the open-world crime genre.  The story follows Wei Shen, an undercover cop, as he attempts to infiltrate and undermine the local Triads.  I found the story engaging and the various characters memorable, and while the plot doesn’t offer too much in the way of surprises for those familiar with organized crime and undercover police stories, it does tell its tale with panache and style.The undercover angle to the story also makes its way into the gameplay, encouraging you to balance violence and brutality to please the Triads with an adherence to law and order and minimized collateral damage to appease Wei’s police handlers.  It’s a great idea, but it really only comes into play during story missions.  Personally, I would have liked to see it expanded into other aspects of gameplay, especially the game’s side missions.Further differentiating Sleeping Dogs from its neighbors is a focus on brawling over gunplay, which given the setting and story seems quite appropriate.  The fighting mechanics are accessible and I enjoyed opportunities to thrash hordes of thugs with little more than fists and whatever was around at the time.Sleeping Dogs gets my thumbs up.  According to my Steam clock, I put about 25 hours into the game.  Time well spent, in my opinion.  My only caveat is that I found the game to play much better with a controller instead of mouse and keyboard, though that may be a matter of taste more than anything else.			",433,269,12,116,66,5,100

												This is truly a hidden gem among the games that were released in 2012. If you are a fan of action cinema, asian cinema and those old 80s/90s films about crooked cops in urban areas that had fight sequences, or Jackie Chan movies like ""Rumble in the Bronx"" I highly recommend this game. The story plays out exactly like those movies and the focus on hand to hand combat and martial arts and not gunplay also elevates this game to another level and separates it from games like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. Although there are gun sequences in the game they are only last resort time scenarios where the protagnist has no other choice but to use weapons as a means to get out of trouble. I also have to say that certain car sequences in the game feel and play out exactly like those in action films and it is a treat to engage in them. Highly Recommend this game.			",145,13,2,12,7,1,14

												You play as Rover, the friendly and intelligent family dog. You are the biggest corgi the world has ever seen, and you must eat all the sausages in the kitchen, until you can fight no longer, and you become the Sleeping Dog. Really now, you play as a Jackie Chan double who is actually a sleeper agent (hence the name, hurr durr) and you want no trabble. You fight your way through several ladder factories while holding several different babies, in your fight against slightly bigger asian people that look like they're straight out of Fast and Furious. You go through several losses, in this trainless society, and sleep with many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, although it is wisely disguised as if you are getting a massage from a massage parlour. You go through several girlfriends, and lose none of the perks that came with them after you pump and dump through all of them, essentially leaving the world with several Jackie Chan babies. You also learn many secret hidden techniques by picking up some sort of Chinese takeout food, or something along those lines, I don't really recall because it was unmemorable, but that's besides the point. The game has you fighting in a very enticing combat system that allows you to have fun while you steamroll everybody as if you were a train. What this game lacks in trains, it makes up for in witty dialog, enticing story, and fun gameplay. The main character is likeable, and most of the game is played through his eyes where he's constantly at odds of being caught by the criminals he associates with. Overall, if you want a fun, and mindless beat 'em up game, with a karaoke minigame in it that frankly deserves its own review, you should get Sleeping Dogs, because who doesn't want to be an oversized corgi, fighting sausages in the kitchen?

												Well, first of all, Sleeping Dogs is one of the greatest and most fascinating games of all the time. Some people would say that it's a copy of GTA Series but i disagree. Yea, I will admit that it looks similar because you complete missions, fight, steal cars, got your own house etc but Sleeping Dogs is totally different from any GTA Game.Sleeping Dogs is a superb and amusing game FULL of action. At every mission you must fight with thugs, punch their faces, drive with a car and probably escape from the cops. I know it sounds like the gameplay of any other Action game, but to be honest I was impressed from this one.The game takes place in China, Hong Kong and the atmosphere is really realistic.The story of the game is an interesting one and if you play the game I'd suggest you not to skip the parts of the dialogues.The part I like most from Sleeping Dogs, is the fighting system. There is a variety of techniques and combination of buttons in order to perform special moves and punches. There is also the ability to grab an enemy and throw him somewhere in order to make him die with a brutal way.I actually couldn't notice any remarkable con but I didn't like the driving system and the storyline quests are quite easy I can say. Except these, there are some small glitches in the game but they are not remarkable tho.+ Interesting Story+ FULL of Action Game+ Realistic Atmosphere+ Fighting/Combat System+ Brutal Gameplay/Kills+ Free-running mode- Driving System- Easy Storyline Quests- Small GlitchesOverall Rating: 9.5/10 ",172,24,9,18,10,2,7

												Sleeping Dogs was a great surprise! Yes, it is a GTA clone indeed, but it only takes the best aspects from Rockstar's games and then tries to add something new to it, like a good hand to hand combat system, a big selling point for this title. You play as an undercover cop with a dark past who infiltrates the dangerous Honk Kong triads, trying in the meantime to solve some intricate cases for the local police department.This dualism between the good and the bad sides of the main character is well used by the developers, missions are always interesting and fun to play, you want to go ahead and discover what happens next. Secondary missions are not bad either, even buying vechicles and clothes in order to obtain different bonuses is well implemented and not a mere filler.Sleeping Dogs is also very easy to play, a bit arcadey if you want, and with some small control glitches, but immediate to master. Technically I really liked the graphics (download the highres textures!) and the voices of the characters, very well interpreted. Honk Kong is a big city with its different districts, not so diversified as any other GTA, but interesting to explore nonetheless. The story is well narrated, nothing breathtaking but good enough to keep you playing for at least 20-30 hours. In the end I think I can suggest this game to any other GTA fan who wants something a bit different and fresh, while maintaining a well know gameplay infrastructure. If you don't already have Sleeping Dogs maybe this is the right moment to buy it, the Definitive Edition just went live with better graphics and all DLCs included!			",55,63,0,5,3,0,10

												Sleeping dogs is an excellent game if you like the open world of grand theft auto but with a well written and compelling story, the graphics are beautiful and the game runs smoothly on medium even on my HD 7750.The combat is brilliantly done, feels great and is very easy to use.You play as wei shen an undercover cop that is trying to take down a huge gang in hong kong, i dont want to spoil anything but you should play the game to uncover all of the mysteries in the city.In GTA IV when you earnt money you couldn't really spend it on anything other than $1 hot dogs and paying hospital bills, but in Sleeping Dogs there are lots of ways to spend the money such as buying faster cars to be able to compete in certain races and buying clothes that have different effects on your abilities etc;You can find collectibles around the city that you can find to increase health, protection or fighting abilities which is quite nice, the golden statues are also hidden around the city and if you find them all you will be able to finsh your fighting training at the kung fu school.Gang hideouts are found throughtout the map and are captured by beating up gang members and hacking into the camera system, you can then go home and access that camera and after a while a new group of gang members will appear and you can then pick which one is making the drug deal and have them arrested.There arent that many flaws that I could pin-point, but i was a little disappointed that once you finish all of the main missions and side-missions there werent that many things to do, for example the races are tied into the side-missions so once you finish them they are gone and I thought if you could mabye use your phone to arrange a race that would have been a nice feature that would have made me play it even more.I would definately reccomend this game, the story is well done, the driving is good, combat is bloody amazing and it will keep you entertained for hours, lots to do until the end of the game and also...why dont you have a pork bun in your hand?

												Looking for a great story driven, immersive open world action RPG?  Look no further.Sleeping Dogs originally came out to little fanfare. It just sort of was THERE suddenly. I took a chance on it when I originally saw it, and it payed off. This is a good game.The game itself follows the exploits of Wei Shen, an undercover cop sent in to infiltrate and bring down the Triads in Hong Kong. And exploits indeed! You'll find yourself doing everything from making deliveries, to burning down rival gang warehouses, carting around women planning their weddings, singing karaoke, racing, and much, much more.The gameplay itself is great, everything flows smooth, and looks good. If you're familiar with Grand Theft Auto, you'll probably feel right at home here, with a few exceptions.One of those exceptions is the combat system. In most open world games there's very little melee. Usually a punch or a kick and that's about it. In SD, there's a fully features fighting system that's like a cross between Soul Calibre and Die Hard Arcade. It's fun, though it can be challenging. I found myself rather enjoying when fights came my way.There's also a shooting aspect, which isn't particularly impressive, though quite functional.There's also more parkour bits than in games like GTA. You'll find yourself running after suspects (or running away from them) at several points in the game, over rooftops and through back alley markets.The graphics, as I mentioned, are quite good. The game is a few years old now and even without the high-res textures, Hong Kong has rarely looked more immersive. Tall buildings, bright lights, weather effects, you name it. It's all very convincing.There are a few things to be cautioned about though. The game is VERY bloody, and there's a TON of language. It's not really surprising, given the subject matter, but the squeemish may want to hold off. Just in fights alone you can slash people with knives and cleavers, break arms and legs, slam faces into ventilations fans, and use a number of other environmental objects to deliver what are very clearly death-blows to your enemies. The majority of which are shown. There's also some even more grisly things which are more implied than shown.The language would be a definite R rating as well. The characters in the Triad drop F bombs like they're going out of style.The game lacks multiplayer, though it does allow you to compare scores and records with your friends. Silly things like longest wheelie, highest number of hit and runs in a row, largest amount of money collected from parking meters, etc are all counted, and the game will show you who of your friends has the highest record for you to beat, while you're doing it; so you have a reference.The story itself is more or less linear, but solid. You do develop attachments to the characters and what happens around them. I would say it stands up a bit better than the GTAV story. The ending though did feel a little bit rushed. (I'll avoid any spoilers) Most all the writing and dialogue is pretty good, though the romance parts of the game fell pretty flat.(I got yelled at by a girl for ""cheating on her"" with a girl I met all of one time, and I didn't even know I was supposedly dating the first girl.)TLDR/All in all, Sleeping Dogs is a fantastic game. It has some flaws but most of them are small and easy to ignore. It's definitely in my list of all-time great games. I highly recommend it.			",329,76,4,50,52,4,63

												Sleeping Dogs provides players with an engrossing narrative set to the atmospheric and richly-detailed backdrop of Hong Kong. An extensive array of additional missions and activities ensure there are always opportunities for further adventure and action to discover while roaming the streets. Along with an impressive presentation for both the visuals and music, Sleeping Dogs is without doubt the sleeper hit of 2012 for open world action games.Square Enix and United Front Games pulled Sleeping Dogs from the brink of death, and what surprised me is just how good it turned out to be.Unlike the previous ‘True Crime’ games, where there was a strict depiction of the city maps, Sleeping Dogs does not portray Hong Kong, inch by inch. United Front Games has implemented GTA’s novelties in way that winks slyly at Rockstar. In essence, what the GTA series has accomplished, Sleeping Dogs has carried out better and more elegantly.This game is a very pleasant surprise that's throwing down the gauntlet to GTA V with its Cantonese oral insult. The game's story along with plenty of gaming mechanics' innovation make Sleeping Dogs a truly remarkable and never-ending joyride with no intention to imitate the original at all costs.Sleeping Dogs is now the example developers should strive to beat when they want to create a game in this genre, because Square Enix's title is now the new leader of the pack.

												Everyone who likes single player games should pick this up. There's so much kungfu. It reminds me of old Hong Kong cinema. The story is excellent thus far with amazing voice actors. I'm totally engaged. It's way better than GTA. The kungfu plays out like Batman, but it's slightly more complicated because of interesting combos. You can also smash people into world objects. I threw a guy through a giant fish tank and laughed as it exploded all around him. The racing is solid and there's tons of mini games like karaoke. Honestly, this is the best pick up since the Witcher 2 and Mafia 2. Check this game out if you love open worlds and kung fu.			",301,49,6,44,22,2,56

												Sleeping Dogs is a really good game. It was hyped a lot for me by many people and I have only recently decided to play it. I honestly felt a little underwhelmed at first (after playing a lot of GTA V before this game), but after I got stuck in I had a lot of fun. The game made me smile so many times, from it's action movie combat to it's clever humor and dialogue. The story is amazing and really stands out compared to other games of a similar style. The game focuses primarily on melee combat and using the environment, but when guns are used they are great fun too especially with slow mo. I thought the voice acting was fantastic and the characters were generally really well done.Id highly recommend giving Sleeping Dogs a go if you enjoy open world games with a good story.

												Sleeping Dogs is a great game and has a lot going for it. First of is the graphics. The game looks amazing on pc if you download the free HD texture pack. All the settings you would expect to bee in a pc game is there, and im glad to see a publisher that actually give us the full experience thats possible with a pc. The gameplay is no less then amazing. With the focus being on hand to hand combat, and using the environment to your advantage in spectacularly violent finishing moves, makes the fighting exciting and action packed. The guns are nothing special, the fun is found in the martial art style moves you can pull off. The combos aren't hard to pull off, but still give you that satisfying feeling when you do them. you learn more advanced and damaging moves as you progress through the game, and the pacing feels right. The story of this game is actually really solid. When i bought this game I expected a mediocre story at best, but when I got when i started playing, i found my self sucked in. I played the whole main story doing every mission back to back, which is really rare for me. The characters are well developed and the missions where really varied, and there was no feeling of doing repetitive tasks. The world it self looks gorgeous. I love the setting, and the city feels vibrant and alive. You can pretty much go anywhere you like, and there is a lot of little minigames, like participate in illegal fighting tournaments to win cash, collecting the jade-statues for new combos, hacking securety cameras and much more.The only downside to this game is that the best experience requires a controller. If you have one, this game is a no-brainer.The overall experience is great. I would reccomend this game at full price to pople who enjoy openworld ''GTA-Like'' games, and at a discount this is a must have for pretty much anyone.			",252,49,5,22,32,3,15

												An incredible game! The pictures and box art do not do this game justice. This game is like playing a Hong Kong triad crime movie! Fantastic storyline, open world that you can explore, great soundtrack, and side missions that offer additional gameplay as well. The DLCs are worth noting as well. This game makes me want to go to Hong Kong hoping that it turns out like the streets of Hong Kong are in this game! Hell, I even learned some Cantonese from playing this game! Two thumbs up...

												Looking for a great story driven, immersive open world action RPG?  Look no further.Sleeping Dogs originally came out to little fanfare. It just sort of was THERE suddenly. I took a chance on it when I originally saw it, and it payed off. This is a good game.The game itself follows the exploits of Wei Shen, an undercover cop sent in to infiltrate and bring down the Triads in Hong Kong. And exploits indeed! You'll find yourself doing everything from making deliveries, to burning down rival gang warehouses, carting around women planning their weddings, singing karaoke, racing, and much, much more.The gameplay itself is great, everything flows smooth, and looks good. If you're familiar with Grand Theft Auto, you'll probably feel right at home here, with a few exceptions.One of those exceptions is the combat system. In most open world games there's very little melee. Usually a punch or a kick and that's about it. In SD, there's a fully features fighting system that's like a cross between Soul Calibre and Die Hard Arcade. It's fun, though it can be challenging. I found myself rather enjoying when fights came my way.There's also a shooting aspect, which isn't particularly impressive, though quite functional.There's also more parkour bits than in games like GTA. You'll find yourself running after suspects (or running away from them) at several points in the game, over rooftops and through back alley markets.The graphics, as I mentioned, are quite good. The game is a few years old now and even without the high-res textures, Hong Kong has rarely looked more immersive. Tall buildings, bright lights, weather effects, you name it. It's all very convincing.There are a few things to be cautioned about though. The game is VERY bloody, and there's a TON of language. It's not really surprising, given the subject matter, but the squeemish may want to hold off. Just in fights alone you can slash people with knives and cleavers, break arms and legs, slam faces into ventilations fans, and use a number of other environmental objects to deliver what are very clearly death-blows to your enemies. The majority of which are shown. There's also some even more grisly things which are more implied than shown.The language would be a definite R rating as well. The characters in the Triad drop F bombs like they're going out of style.The game lacks multiplayer, though it does allow you to compare scores and records with your friends. Silly things like longest wheelie, highest number of hit and runs in a row, largest amount of money collected from parking meters, etc are all counted, and the game will show you who of your friends has the highest record for you to beat, while you're doing it; so you have a reference.The story itself is more or less linear, but solid. You do develop attachments to the characters and what happens around them. I would say it stands up a bit better than the GTAV story. The ending though did feel a little bit rushed. (I'll avoid any spoilers) Most all the writing and dialogue is pretty good, though the romance parts of the game fell pretty flat.(I got yelled at by a girl for ""cheating on her"" with a girl I met all of one time, and I didn't even know I was supposedly dating the first girl.)TLDR/All in all, Sleeping Dogs is a fantastic game. It has some flaws but most of them are small and easy to ignore. It's definitely in my list of all-time great games. I highly recommend it.			",329,76,4,50,52,4,63

												Everyone who likes single player games should pick this up. There's so much kungfu. It reminds me of old Hong Kong cinema. The story is excellent thus far with amazing voice actors. I'm totally engaged. It's way better than GTA. The kungfu plays out like Batman, but it's slightly more complicated because of interesting combos. You can also smash people into world objects. I threw a guy through a giant fish tank and laughed as it exploded all around him. The racing is solid and there's tons of mini games like karaoke. Honestly, this is the best pick up since the Witcher 2 and Mafia 2. Check this game out if you love open worlds and kung fu.			",301,49,6,44,22,2,56

												Breathtaking graphics and rich atmosphere! Sleeping Dogs is quite the respectable alternative to a GTA:China. Gameplay mechanics are not as traditional with more focus on character skills. What feels lacking (not being able to store jacked cars) is compensated for in others (purchasing indefinately respawnable cars). The story is engaging with many conspiracies and twists. Many stats are now shared with your steam friends who also own the game. Compete for the best! Did I mention half the radio stations are in Chinese? Atmosphere!			",568,181,24,59,69,7,108

												Sleeping Dogs provides players with an engrossing narrative set to the atmospheric and richly-detailed backdrop of Hong Kong. An extensive array of additional missions and activities ensure there are always opportunities for further adventure and action to discover while roaming the streets. Along with an impressive presentation for both the visuals and music, Sleeping Dogs is without doubt the sleeper hit of 2012 for open world action games.Square Enix and United Front Games pulled Sleeping Dogs from the brink of death, and what surprised me is just how good it turned out to be.Unlike the previous ‘True Crime’ games, where there was a strict depiction of the city maps, Sleeping Dogs does not portray Hong Kong, inch by inch. United Front Games has implemented GTA’s novelties in way that winks slyly at Rockstar. In essence, what the GTA series has accomplished, Sleeping Dogs has carried out better and more elegantly.This game is a very pleasant surprise that's throwing down the gauntlet to GTA V with its Cantonese oral insult. The game's story along with plenty of gaming mechanics' innovation make Sleeping Dogs a truly remarkable and never-ending joyride with no intention to imitate the original at all costs.Sleeping Dogs is now the example developers should strive to beat when they want to create a game in this genre, because Square Enix's title is now the new leader of the pack.

												Trust me when I say to get this version over the Definitive Edition (you can still get this version from GMG and other places).The reason? This version runs so much better than the DE. Everything is really smooth and there are no framerate drops. If you get the DE, you'll get weird and random framerate drops even if you have a great rig! Now, you might say that the DE has better graphics. Not necessarily so. If you buy this version and install the free HD texture pack that's included, I PROMISE you won't notice any graphical differences between this and the DE.As far as the game itself goes, it's fantastic and you'll have a hell of a lot of fun. Yeah, GTA V is what the cool kids are playing nowadays but you'll be sorely missing out on a great experience if you overlook this game. Personally, I like this MORE than GTA V. They're both great games but I had more fun with this one.So whether you buy this version or the DE (though I advise against not getting the DE), you're in for a ton of fun!Highly recommended.

												Great game. Pretty much what you'd get if GTA and John Woo had a baby who was raised by Shenmue and uncle Bruce Lee visited once in a while with his buddy Jackie Chan. Then the kid becomes a teen, gets angsty and decides to become a cop to go play with the Triads and punch everybody in the face. While drinking tea.Gameplay goes from good (the fighting) to pretty meh (the driving), but it is serviceable once you get used to it. You'll need a relatively recent gamepad with XInput, the game doesn't like DirectInput and throws a tantrum if it detects it.			",65,17,3,13,7,0,12

												Sleeping Dogs is a solid GTA style game within a Hong Kong setting. The game world is vibrant and lively and the driving is smooth and easy to handle. Combat places a heavier emphasis on brawling rather than gunplay but both feel spectacular and robust. The combination of fluid game mechanics and story, where you assume the role of an embedded undercover cop, makes for a satisfying John Woo action flick experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion the story is really good and it's way too long ago that a story attracted me that much, usually I often stop playing games because I'm getting bored of them easily... The game is about Wei Shen an undercover cop with the order to infiltrate the triad in Hong Kong. It offers a ""GTA Game Style"" that means it has an open world, cars, guns, drugs and explosions. The map isn't that big as in other games these days but that's ok. The handling of the cars is very washy and could be improved. I don't really care about the graphics but I guess it's ok if you make sure to install the free HD Textures DLC. Either way it's a game I recommend to everyone who likes to play games with a very good and emotional story.PS. If you are from Germany it could be possible that the DLC's are blocked so you have to activate them using a VPN!Is it worth to buy? - Yes, it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game right here may be the game of the year for me. Sleeping Dogs takes the best of the openworld undercover genre and shakes it up with its own style. Instead of run and gunning like GTA or DEM SAINTS you'll be focusing on hand to hand combat throughout much of the game. Alot more guns do eventually come into play when things get a bit crazier and serious and I'm glad that they worked it out that way as it really adds to the feel that triad war is heating up. The story is actually really well done, cutscenes are pretty and the voiceacting is fantastic. Most importantly though they build up characters just right so that you can empathize with them (with the exception of one VERY forced character that you spend the day driving around). You never feel overwhelmed with stuff like in GTA and the story tension keeps you going for completion of main missions. There are a ton of clothes to collect, so you can look stylin' while you do your thing. The game killed someone I liked so 9.9/10			",434,75,9,67,34,8,66

												Hmm... where do I start with this game? Well for starters, this overlooked title is frequently compared to the GTA franchise. So what does this game have to offer?What I like about this game:- The setting of Hong Kong, loosely based off of the real Hong Kong that is...- The hand-to-hand combat with interactivity of the environment to even the odds a bit (and because it looks fancy).- The story following an undercover police officer.- The protagonist Wei Shen and the characters he interacts with.- The colorful environment making Hong Kong feel active (especially the night market)Stuff that gave me mixed feelings or have no opinion on:- The AI: sometimes their behavior get pretty wonky at times, but nothing majorly broken with them- The side activities: they're okay if not a little underwhelming since there isn't a lot of stuff to do aside from side quests. For me, the two gambling activities are kind of a waste of your time unless you want a method to toss your money away more quickly.- Environmental glitches: I encountered about one or two bugs, with one of them involving a wire attached to a security camera floating in the middle of a parking lot, but nothing major.- The protagonist Wei Shen never speaking a single word in Cantonese (he said one word in Cantonese in the wheels of fury dlc, much to my suprise). Honestly it confuses me a little bit, but that's just a minor complaint. I'm just going to assume he just has a preference to strictly speaking english anyway.- Guns: yes, yes, nothing's fun without gunplay, but obtaining guns is a little different than what you would expect from GTA. While gunplay is pretty fun, there is no way of purchasing firearms or ammunition so the only way you can get them outside of story missions (and occasionally DLC) is to do it the hard way: steal them from the HKPD. Completing the story will get you a golden Desert Eagle for you to use.- The map size: a bit small for an open world game, but it's tolerable.- The mini map: most of the time, directions for way points work, but there was one area that partially breaks the GPS and tells you to go around in circles until you disobey it.What I didn't like:- The ending: It didn't bother me too much, but I kinda wish you could become a member of the Triads full-time or stay loyal to the Hong Kong Police Department.- The DLC: personally I think most of them don't really offer much, but I think a few of them are probably worth purchasing, especially if they're on sale.- The second to last story mission: specifically it is the quick-time event on the scaffolding where button mashing is required. The reason why I hate that sequence is because there is a programing error that if you rapidly button mash, you will fail regardless of how fast you press the spacebar. How to get past it is to find a steady rhythm and keep the rhythm for about 20 - 30 seconds. (Note that it took me 10 minutes to figure out what was going on and go to the forums to look for help. I know, it's really sad to admit that it took me that long for me to figure it out)- Animation quality: they didn't put a lot of effort into animation outside of the official cutscenes. They put effort into lip-syncing and movement in the cutscenes, but didn't even try to put any effort outside of that, althought when it comes to movement like walking and running, they are just fine. (I should note that they ""semi-locked"" the camera to make sure you don't see Wei's face, and when you do see it, it's very obvious they didn't even bother)- Camera angles: my main pet peev comes from driving when you want to go reverse, the camera automatically rotates around the car and I'd rather do it manually because it feels really disorienting to have the game do it for me.What will kick most people in the teeth:- The lack of a multiplayer: the game has a social hub for you to compare scores with your friends, but some people like me will not care about numbers and might be upset that there is no physical multiplayer to play with your friends.Despite my complaints, this game has plenty to offer and is definitely worth the current price tag and deserves more attention that it currently has.

												This game right here may be the game of the year for me. Sleeping Dogs takes the best of the openworld undercover genre and shakes it up with its own style. Instead of run and gunning like GTA or DEM SAINTS you'll be focusing on hand to hand combat throughout much of the game. Alot more guns do eventually come into play when things get a bit crazier and serious and I'm glad that they worked it out that way as it really adds to the feel that triad war is heating up. The story is actually really well done, cutscenes are pretty and the voiceacting is fantastic. Most importantly though they build up characters just right so that you can empathize with them (with the exception of one VERY forced character that you spend the day driving around). You never feel overwhelmed with stuff like in GTA and the story tension keeps you going for completion of main missions. There are a ton of clothes to collect, so you can look stylin' while you do your thing. The game killed someone I liked so 9.9/10			",434,75,9,67,34,8,66

												Sleeping Dogs is an outstanding game that takes the open world elements from Grand Theft Auto and combine it with the melee combat system from the Batman Arkham games and you have a game that has a gorgeous world and satisfying combat. The game takes place in Hong Kong and the world is full of realistic details; just walking around you hear everyone speaking in Cantonese and the radio is filled with Cantonese songs. The streets are littered with stores and vendors trying to get you to purchase something; the world is full of these little details which makes the game feel alive. The combat and open world driving is very satisfying and fun. The real highlight of the game is the story, where you are an undercover cop moving up the ranks in the Triad. The story missions are all varied and are full of twists and turns. Overall, the game takes about 40 hours to completely 100% the main game and to finish the 3 large DLCs and the various small DLCs which add some additional missions/content. There are tons of collectibles to find and lots of areas to explore, so if you're a fan of open world games this is a must play with an awesome story and amazing martial arts combat. By the way, check out who voices the characters in the game, you will be surprised to see how many famous actors/actresses are in this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fantastic storyline, open world that you can explore, great soundtrack, and side missions that offer additional gameplay as well. The DLCs are worth noting as well. This game makes me want to go to Hong Kong hoping that it turns out like the streets of Hong Kong are in this game! Hell, I even learned some Cantonese from playing this game! Two thumbs up...

												This game is awesome. The storyline is incredibly gripping and causes the player to really feel some feelz. I also want to make a comment on the quality of the AIs: I could predict who was going to do what in the fights because they behaved like actual humans. This is one of the few games I've ever played where this is the case. The graphics are amazing, even on medium. Not to mention that I can actually run it on my laptop. Although it's no longer the newest game in the franchise, I feel I must make a comparison to Grand Theft Auto 4. The graphics in this are better than GTA 4's graphics, and it freezes and crashes on the first load screen for me. The only complaint I have is the occasional small bug, i.e. in the very first part of the game (the part where you're running from the cops), the guy I was supposed to be following decided that the middle of us being chased by the cops was just the absolute perfect time to stop running, confusing the hell out of me in the process. Anyways, thanks for reading this exteremely long review (assuming that any of you have :/) and to the developer I say keep up the great work! :D			",95,14,2,9,24,0,9

That's pretty lame in my opinion.Despite that, a solid 9.5/10!P.S. - DLCs that are worth buying in my opinion: Wheels of Fury, Nightmare in North Point, Year of the Snake.

												Open world grand theft auto kung fu madness - The only way I can explain this game in some simple words that all would understand.Okay.The graphics are fairly decent with not amazing but certainly not bad but really good to look at.The controls are really easy to get used too, even hoping from car to car is so easy you cannot complain.The sound seems like a silly cheap movie rip off I found which is amusing but becomes boring after a while, and I went around playing with no sound listening to music.The game itself is good fun with a small world but you learn to push past that when you notice you do a few decent stuff in the world, and the DLC in the game is really nice too.The story I did not play and complete because I was not impressed that much.  It was go here beat this person, go here catch this person, go chase this person, repeat, repeat, repeat and I was bored after only 11hours in this game.  I am sure the story contains some amazing moments but it did not grab me quick enough to keep me entertained.I did pay £29.99 for this game as a preorder and now the game is £14.99 (Now on sale as we speak for £2.99 which is a STEAL) and the £14.99 is really cheap as it is because of what the game offers.If you like open world, stealing cars, beating people, kung fu fighting, just cause leaping from cars, then this game will keep you going for way longer than myself.You really nice feature in the game was the car control.  The sounds on the cars, and the way it dips and dives when turning, specially the bikes was sooooo nice.  Anyway, this game is worth the time and money you want to put into it.Shame there was no multiplayer and only singleplayer but still. Good fun.			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												It's not everyone's type of game. There's no multiplayer and to be honest you'd be better off playing it with an xbox 360 controller or similar controller with the emulator mod (ask if you need the link). I've met and have heard from others in the forums that using keyboard and mouse, you eventually get used to it and the only difficulty is in the driving. I actually used both, shooting with keyboard/mouse and fighting and driving the xbox controller. Regardless of price (I did buy it discounted through some key re-seller friends, but it wasn't at this price nor were the dlc I got with it) I totally enjoyed this great game. It's like every John Woo film and a lot of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan films put into story mode. There's even a dlc called Zodiac Tornament that is pretty much the movie Enter the Dragon where you go to an island tournament with all the different stlyed fighters and of course have to beat the evil organiser of the tournament, classic Hong Kong movie stuff to be had all round.Story wise, you are an ex Triad gang member gone to the States and returns to Hong Kong assigned the task of getting into a gang that you have ties to from your youth and a score to settle with one of the leaders of another faction of the Triad gang Sun On Yee. You have to deal with all the politics and oblivious Police dept. issues as well as the gut wrenching ethical dilemas of being a cop posing as gangster to people you eventually end up respecting and caring for as almost family.If you are time poor and just want to experience the story and action unabated you can get this game complete with all the upgrades and rip through the game almost too quickly but have all the bling and weapons at the game start. Remember though a lot of the unlocks are earnt through the game progress, not all but a lot are and it's usually stated on the dlc page itself if that's the case so have a look before you buy and save some cash if you need to.

												Coming into this game, I expected a mediocre GTA clone set in Hong Kong. Now, having played about 12 hours or 30% of the whole game, I feel that I like this more than I liked Dishonored.The story is the best I've seen for any open-world action/crime game. Wei Shen is an undercover cop who is tasked with taking down the Triads of Hong Kong from within, attempting to balance loyalty to the law and playing the part of a gang member. As the story progresses, you get to know more about certain characters that would be considered the ""bad guys"" and morality in this game is no longer black and white. Having not finished it yet, it will be interesting to see whether Wei forsakes his duty as a cop or brings down the house on the criminals.The game has an immense focus on melee combat and it plays almost identical to Arkham Asylum, but it doesn't straight out copy it. You level up your combos and abilities which was soemthing Arkham didn't really focus on. You can also grapple enemies and unleash ""environmental kills"" and use an air conditioner as a blender for some guy's head. You can use butcher knives, tire irons, and a few other melee weapons to kill, but after 10 strikes the weapons ""break"", so when you actually find one, you know that you'll need to still rely on your fists. As for guns, they are rare and powerful. VERY rare. I had to wait maybe 3 hours to get my hands on a pistol. However, though they are few and far between, the gunfights are most enjoyable. Cars play a big role in the game, and the driving is superb, though not perfect. The ramming mechanic is unrealistic but fun and certain vehicles (any truck) feels clunky. Also, there is no inventory system. You can not sheathe weapons or carry multiple guns. Typically, you can never take a weapon into free-roam from a mission, which reminds me: The game never gets tedious. The missions are plentiful and enjoyable, though some (like the Drug Busts) have the exact same structure (though a different environment) and tend to get a little repetetive, but not boring.The graphics are amazing and I never thought I'd say it, but China is beautiful. The high-resolution texture pack is not that better than the base game, but it's better nonetheless. One thing I don't like, is that on Extreme Anti-Aliasing, the game hovers at about 30 frames per second, but on Ultra AA, the game hovers at 90. LOL WUT?All in all, this game is fabulous. I don't understand why it wasn't hyped up or ranked up with games like Dishonored, Borderlands, and Far Cry 3. This truly was the most underrated title of 2012, and it closely ties with Dishonored for my game of the year.9.5 out of 10			",472,132,6,82,66,1,109

												An excellent entry by Square Enix into the third-person crime genre, alongside more celebrated titles such as Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. The game revolves around a well-written plot involving the player as an undercover Hong Kong police officer returned from America who has been tasked with infiltrating the local triads to shut them down. An fantastic cast featuring some very distinctive and memorable characters who you grow to sympathise with and love or hate regardless of their faction complements a twisting, turning, and storyline, with an explosive conclusion.While many games which do not focus on driving have driving issues, the driving in Sleeping Dogs is quite smooth, regardless of the vehicle you may be driving, whether it be a car, van, or motorcycle. This is complemented by the damage you can do in vehicles, and also by the incredibly fun ability to enter moving enemy vehicles... provided you don't fall off, of course!An incredibly fun open world experience based on the city of Hong Kong, the lack of air vehicles does not actually limit the game, with the ability to get to various places, even some quite high, on foot. The map and city is well-designed, and the game's ability to mix things up with extra side material such as catching criminals, hacking cameras, cracking locks, and singing karaoke only increases the game's allure.And then, finally. The combat. Despite the ability to slow time, and move over, to and around cover while shooting is quite nice, it is in close quarters hand-to-hand combat that the game shines. With the ability to pick up various items and wield them as weapons, from cleavers to handbags to fish, you can be sure that a fistfight will turn bloody and conclude quite brutally. The visceral nature of hand-to-hand combat is furthered by the implementation of ""environmental hazards"" - objects or locations in the world which you can use to finish off your enemies. Incredibly enjoyable and interesting, if very violent, the close combat in this game is truly a standout feature.			",803,140,28,161,113,7,224

												Awesome game. I think to myself, why I didn't play it sooner. It's better than most of the other sandbox games on the market in terms of quality.This game takes open world to a new level, Hong Kong Island looks amazing in it. I've lived in Hong Kong and whilst the game is obviously on a a smaller scale to real life, it really captures the feel of Hong Kong very well. The combat is really fun and this game feels like a combination of GTA, Assassins Creed and Shenmue.Great combat, interesting plot, brilliantly designed sandbox and some fun and unique gameplay additions. Well done to Square Enix for once too, actually picking up a failed Activision product and getting it released. Maybe you aren't as bad as I thought, you should get United Front Games to do collab work with you on every game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs is a really good game if you enjoy titles similar to Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row.  The game is very nice to look at especially after you install the high resolution texture pack.  The setting is also very interesting.  The only thing that keeps it from being a definite ""must buy"" are its numerous inexplainable glitches.  Sometimes things have just ""stopped working right"".  For instance, at one point I was using my cell phone in-game and was unable to dismiss it from my hand.  I had to exit to the main menu and reload the game.  When I did this the phone was still in my hand, but I was able to put it away.  Just oddball stuff like this happens from time to time.  The driving in the game is not very interesting and makes the races more of a pain than actual fun.  Other than that it is very entertaining.  The fighting in the game is a blast.  It is nice to see a game going more for martial arts than blasting everything around you with a gun or tank.  It is a good game but, as I said, the glitches and driving mechanics keep it from being a classic.			",739,230,20,125,67,8,105

												Very immersive and fun game thats pretty easy to learn to play and where the story keeps going fast paced to keep you playing. The combat system and gunplay is amazingly fun and you get to know the characters pretty well with emotions and really awesome voice acting. The world is quite big and open for you to explore and to find the treasures lying around all over the map.The graphics are just amazing as well if your computer can handle the highest settings, though its really fancy just at medium-high anyway.After you finish the game there is a chance that you wish that the story and life in there would continue on with you in it. The DLCs is a slight help for it but its not enough. There must be a sequel released any time soon.			",398,61,12,44,33,3,40

												Okay, let's talk about Sleeping Dogs. First off there are no dogs sleeping in the game.Here you infiltrate yourself in the ""Hong Kong"" hoods, you play as Wei Shenand this is where the journey begin.Has a mod with HD textures for a bettergraphical experience.Even though I played this in Xbox 360I totally had to play it in PC. (Ty, ShapeDuck)+ 3rd Person+ Gets bizarre at times... like really really bizarre+ Very good gameplay but driving cars.+ Such an interesting story+ Sandbox+ Many skills- Some glitches- No season passI'd totally love to have a season pass for this game, hopefully they'll someday-somehow release it.

												Big fan of GTA-genre style games, and this one is really good.  It has great graphics, story is decent, the hand-to-hand combat is more like the Batman Arkham games where you have to parry/combo against mobs.  The gunplay is the worst/wonkiest part of the game IMO, but the game is good enough to tempt me to rebuy the ""Definitive"" version after I already beat the regular one.

												Sleeping Dogs is worthy of its growing reputation as an interesting, semi open world, wander through the city story. It is not GTA, or Saints Row, nor does it pretend to be. Its a cool story about organized crime in Hong Kong (one of my favorite places on earth), the cops, and the city.This game is pretty fun, but it takes a while to get into the story, as well as get going into the gameplay.P.S. There are no dogs in this game.			",81,17,2,3,8,7,8

												A BRILLIANT GTA-like sandbox. Newly arrived in Hong Kong, Wei Shen starts to work his way up through the Triad, but here's the twist. Wei Shen is an undercover police officer tasked with infilitrating the Triad and could blow his cover at any time...I was disappointed wtih GTA IV but until GTA V comes to the PC, this is probably the best organized crime sandbox game you could playPro's-----+ Classic open-world gameplay on the streets of Hong Kong. Besides the normal storyline missions there are  street races, go to a Kareoke bar, play Majong or bet on cockfighting+ Solid, involving story with some very well known Asian and Asian-American actors providing key voices and facial likeness+ Great action, from Kung Fu fights, to intense slow-mo gun-battles to high speed shootouts and death defying hijacks of moving vehicles worthy of a good action movie.+ The rating is well deserved, things get dark, bloody and violentCon's------- Most of the DLC is pretty meh. But if it's cheap, why not...			",46,34,0,27,14,0,7

Posted: December 30, 2013
												TL;DR- 8/10, fun game despite a few flaws.I've heard this game reffered to as ""a poor man's Grand Theft Auto"". And while the moniker may come across as derogatory, I can't disagree. Certain aspects of Sleeping Dogs draw from open world titans like GTA, but it still manages to stand tall of its own merits, rather than on the coattails of GTA.The pros are that it is a legitimately fun game to play. The story was interesting enough to keep me engaged and wanting to dig deeper, combat handled pretty well and was easy to learn, and a lot of the special actions you can perform, such as mid-driving carjacking, are pretty fun to pull off. The dual experience system is implemented fairly well, rewarding you for wreaking as much havok as you can upon your enemies, while punishing you for hurting, killing or destroying anything not related to your mission. Environmental hazards give combat a little more pep, allowing you to seriously injure, if not outright slaughter (sometimes quite brutally) anyone standing in your way.The cons are that there isn't a terrible lot to do outside of the story quests, and what little there is to do becomes repetative and tedious with no meaningful reward. Some of the dialogue and situations/resolutions you come across can be pretty tongue-in-cheek if not outright absurd and cheesy, and felt detractive towards the overall tone and feel of the game. Combat, while easy to learn and diverse in what movesets you can punish your enemies with, ultimately boils down only attacking, grabbing or counters, and doesn't encourage making use of the many skills you can learn except for the sake of doing something flashy. NPCs will sometimes get stuck on terrain or on corners, making some missions impossible to complete without a restart.But the two biggest offenders in this game for me, are the vehicle camera controls, and the option to purchase a number of game breaking features from the start through DLC content. The vehicle camera controls can be frustrating at best and damning at worst. It tends to lock itself in whatever position you move it to relative to your vehicle, and doesn't transition back to the forward position when you begin driving unless you move it back yourself, making multi-point turns and complex driving maneuvers aggrivating.The DLC content almost broke the game for me at the start. I'll admit I grabbed the whole shabang without reading about it all when it was on sale, and I wish I had. After the first couple missions, I suddenly found myself awash in an inordinate amount of Cop and Triad XP, Face XP, money, vehicles and items.. enough so that what was supposed to be earned throughout the course of the game was instantly given to me at the start, making personal progression almost non-existant. If that's your sort of thing, then by all means. Otherwise be wary of what DLC you purchase.Despite the cons and my own complaints about the game however, I'm left feeling quite positive about the overall experience. It's no GTA for sure, but I do think it's worth a look and a playthrough.8/10			",72,1,0,8,1,0,1

Posted: December 5, 2013
												I felt compelled to write a review for Sleeping Dogs, as it is a game that gave me more bang for my buck than most ever have.  I'm a huge fan of open-world games with driving (GTA, Saints Row, Far Cry).  With that said, I 100%'d Sleeping Dogs at about 30 hours in, and my current playtime is now nearing the 118 mark.  I can count the number of games I've 100%'d on less than two hands.  So, I think the important question is, why do I still keep playing?  What caused me to learn this game inside and out, to the point where I know all the mechanics, glitches, and how to mess with every piece of AI?The answer lies in that to me, Sleeping Dogs is just pure fun.  The melee combat is something that almost no other game has done as well, and really the only one that comes to mind is the Arkham series.  Even with Arkham, I find the combat takes too long, whereas in Sleeping Dogs it gets things just right.  It's visceral while remaining simple.  Enemies react in momentary fear to bone-crushing martial arts moves, and the protagonist Wei Shen can masterfully counter and take out hordes of gangsters.  Wei also moves around Hong Kong with basic parkour moves, as he can survive falls of impressive heights and slide over all manner of objects smoothly, if timed right.The other aspect is driving.  Let me preface this section with two things: one, that I vastly prefer arcade style driving (if I want real driving, I'll go take my real car out), and two, the weapon-based DLC car singlehandedly has given me hours upon hours of extra time with the game.  I'll put this bluntly; if you want realistic driving, go play another game.  Ramming cars at high speeds, tearing through the Financial District with a nearly indestructible bus, and blowing out the tires that sends cars flying like a Hollywood movie... all of its is insanely fun.  Add in the DLC car that pretty much breaks the game, and it just gets hilarious how awesomely you can dominate Hong Kong.Sleeping Dogs is far from perfect, however.  Some of the things the game does are laughably bad, like how the police are handled.  I'm not going to mince words here, the police are just terrible.  They're so bad that they're funny, like with how awful horror movies work.  The biggest issue I have is that they literally pop into an area.  You could be in a desolate alley and shoot someone, or beat up a bunch of people in a quiet street with no police anywhere nearby.. and they will literally pop in like they used a portal gun or stepped through a dimensional rift.  If they weren't so easy to shake off and mess with, this would have ruined any sense of immersion the game had.While I thoroughly enjoyed the story with a satisfying ending, which took me about 15-20 hours with exploration and side missions, you could tell that in some sections, the developers did not have the time to implement other features they wanted.  It's pretty obvious that they wanted to include deeper connections to Hong Kong with Wei with how much exploration and collection there were, along with Wei's serial hit-it-and-quit-it attitude with women.  Wei's struggle with his identity and corruption, both in the Triads and the police force, was a compelling reason for me to finish the story, however.Finally, don't let the DLC scare you.  The DLC mostly adds things in to make the game a little more fun, and none of it is necessary whatsoever.  I know some people who wouldn't sneeze at Sleeping Dogs for the amount of DLC it has, but I doubt they ever actually took a look at what it does.  I really believe that Sleeping Dogs is a game that every fan of this genre should play.  Hong Kong's a relatively fresh setting from similar games, and Sleeping Dogs finds its identity in mechanics that are just fun.  Not crazy whacked up purple♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bat fun like Saints Row, and not maniacal, realistic Trevor fun as in GTA, but just super tight, simple, attractive combat with good pacing and a pretty beautiful world.

												It's a good game, but still, it could have been so much more! A big beautiful world (china style), awsome combat, awsome guns, awsome missions. BUT... there could be a lot more. I mean... The world is big yeah, but not much you could with it. The side missions are kinda useful but short. And in the end, you don't choose the side, like either the cops or Yakuza. 7/10			",130,21,3,10,5,1,15

												Third-person open-worldy action game, with hand-to-hand fighting sequences as well as shootouts. Has an engaging storyline and interesting characters, but really, driving around Hong Kong is some of the best fun I've ever had.I'd give this a 9.5 out of 10--the missing 0.5 being the weird collision detection while driving. Sometimes you'll be going full speed with a motorcycle and hit the sidewalk that you can normally walk over will sometimes clip your bike so that you fly into the air. Doesn't happen that much but has a tendency to happen when you least want it to, like when you're doing race events.			",416,120,1,115,24,1,36

												Solid, fun game. Like GTA but set in Hong Kong with a heavy focus on hand-to-hand combat. Great port as opposed to another open world crime game (cough GTA IV), with a cool fighting system and great handling cars/bikes (unlike GTA IV). Story is good but nothing really all that memorable. Physics are unrealistic but absolutely hilarious.Combat is quite similar to the Batman Arkham games ableit doesnt flow as well, but you have the ablity to use the environment against opponents as well as pistols, shotguns and smg's later. Again great, fun game.			",542,89,29,54,49,6,86

												This one is in a similar category to Spec Ops for me. It's a game with AAA production values but a lower level of marketing and sales, which is unfortunate. To me this is pretty clearly a better open world game than GTA4, though the sandbox seems smaller and therefore the game shorter. It's been quite a while since I've played GTA4, so that may not be correct. With that exception, Sleeping Dogs does everything better than GTA4. The graphics are better, the driving is better, the combat is better (though my personal preference would be to have more gunfights and less fist fights), the hidden objects are handled better, etc. I enjoyed the story as well, though it was somewhat predictable. However, had it not been, it wouldn't have been as satisfying as there weren't a lot of ways the loose ends could have been wrapped up. Hopefully Rockstar ""borrows"" some of the gameplay elements for GTAV, though that would have had to be in development before this game was released. Square-Enix should do all PC ports, because they get them right, down to the high resolution texture pack, Steamworks, video options, etc. Thank goodness they saved this game from cancellation.

												Rating: 10/10Story review: Realistic, breath-taking view of Hong Kong mirrored into the game creates an excellent open-world experience that is yet to be chalenged by the likes of GTA.The choreographed fighting, acting, driving and cut scenes are above average, showcasing what is possible when developers take game mechanics seriously and invest in it. The game has a short learning path, even for new comers. You'll get thrown right into action from the first scene, and the nostalgic storyline will keep begging you for a repeat of the story once you're done. Visuals and system requirements: The visuals are stellar, and you will not need to break a bank to build a rig that can play this game. Simply put, if you can play Tomb Raider on Medium settings with DirectX11 features turned on, you'll blaze through this game without breaking a sweat.Stereoscopic 3D via AMD HD3D works out of the box if you have an AMD HD 5000+ GPU connected to a 3D capable monitor via HDMI 1.4a. Depending on your setup, you may need a 3D driver such as Tridef 3D to play it in 3D mode.Personally, I had a blast playing the game and would recommend it highly.			",97,2,5,4,1,0,0

												Wei Shan is A COP. I'm not expect the story of this game. but it's GOOD (much better than GTA4). Good enough to play in 4 - 6 hours non-stop. Bad thing about this game is some little bugs(a few) and NOT THAT FREE-LOOK CAMERA when you driving. This game has many good things such as good fighting system. Not too easy and not too hard. You will like it when you play. World details are stunning.  The environment was created perfectly and beautiful.I played it 3 days, more than 30 hours to finish the game. Worth the money i would say. Many scenes to remember. I do like this game.			",461,95,19,75,50,3,84

												In Sleeping Dogs you're playing as Wei Shen, an undercover police whose job is to infiltrate the rank of triads and at the same time operate as informant to police in Hong Kong. Through the game you will find a lot of missions and side missions to hone your skill as martial artist and gunslinger. Some people said sleeping dogs are just imitation to GTA and True Crime. Well, i disagree with them. In my opinion sleeping dogs have something that surpasses them.A lot of features in sleeping dogs compelled me to said so.. for example :Combat AspectGTA and True Crime doesn't have martial arts to confront their enemies, in Sleeping Dogs you have martial arts as your friend. As Wei Shen, you can learn to do complex moves at dojo. Learn to fight against various enemies, countering attacks from them. You even have a environment to support you while in combat! You can impale enemies to meat hook, dump them in trash bin, smash them to aquarium, and many more.Car HijackWei Shen have ability to hijack car while driving a car without a need to stop first. In a world where you need to be fast to chase down enemies on the road, this would come handy. GTA should adopt this mechanism for their future release.ParkourIn sleeping dogs, chasing criminals is one of the most interesting features of the game. Hongkong are well known as crowded city with a lot of market and cramped building, with parkour you will be able to jump over obstacles and climb over the wall easily while chasing targets.Basically these features are only a few of many best thing in the game. If you like playing GTA or True Crime, this game will easily hook you up with a lot of charming and fresh features. But if you're in for stories you might be a bit disappointed, as the game only tell a common feud between triads and police, nothing new.That leave you one final question, Are you in for the gameplay or are you in for the stories ? This review might help you answer that.			",64,20,0,8,2,0,13

												This game is great. Not as good as GTA, but still quite good. May seem bad at first, but as soon as you get used to the Arcade feel of it and let the storyline progress it becomes hard to stop playing. 2 negatives are the repetitive combat system and the length of the game. But these get cancelled out by the storyline, graphics, voice acting and the realism of the city. Overall it was quite unique, a solid 8/10, definitely worth a playthrough.			",92,6,18,2,3,1,3

												Better than GTA IV.In Sleeping Dogs your playing as Wei Shen who is an undercover cop infiltrating the Triads in Hong Kong. This setting is way more interesting than the generic gangster setting of GTA IV or V. You will encounter a lot of Plot Twists and intresting characters, the melee combat is a lot like the free flow system of the batman games & the driving is easy to handle and feels great.All in all i can recommend this game to everybody who likes games like GTA but with a better story.- Jay			",170,9,3,27,14,3,30

												When I heard about this game, I was hesitant to get it due to the fact that it wasn't as hyped as a GTA or a Saints Row and I didn't want to be disappointed. However, I knew I liked these types of games so I took a chance on it while it was on sale. I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed.Story:You assume the role of Wei Shen, an undercover police officer sent to infiltrate and take down the Sun On Yee, a traid organization based in Hong Kong. Wei deals with the inner conflict of being a cop, while proving himself to the Triads in order to gain their trust and complete his mission. Unfortunately, in order to gain the trust of the Triads, Wei must go against his moral code. It's only a matter of time before Wei gets in too deep.Gameplay:Sleeping Dogs isn't just a GTA or Saints Row clone. It brings something different to the genre. It doesn't feel like a generic recreation of the previously mentioned, more established frachises. This game stands out on it's own with the addition of kung-fu melee fighting, parkour, chase sequences and a conflicting story. Other than the main story, there's side missions, races, drug busts, fight clubs and more. There's also an abundance of collectibles to find throughout the map. On top of that, there's four different skill trees that allow you to upgrade your abilities as you complete missions and activities. The melee fighting is really fun. You're not just blocking, reversing and throwing punches. You can use your environment to your advantage. Some of the environmental kills are brutal. Throw your opponents off a roof, or into an eel tank or impale them onto some meat hooks. There's also several types of melee weapons to use such as crowbars, machetes, tire irons, etc. If the use of guns in these types of games are a necessity to you, this game may not be for you. There are certain missions that will require firearms, but the majority of combat is melee fighting. I would estimate the melee-to-gun combat ratio is about 70/30. Guns are somewhat uncommon. This is even mentioned in the story. However, that's something I actually liked about the game. You had to play differently than you would in a GTA or a Saints Row.The Negatives:I only have two complaints with this game. Firstly, the main story is a bit short. There's only about 30 main story missions. Once I beat the game and watched the ending cutscenes, I thought they could have milked out two or three more missions. Instead, they seemed to rush the end of the story and summarize it in cutscenes. The other complaint I have is the driving. It feels very stiff. I remember when I played the first Saints Row after playing nothing but GTA games and the driving felt so stiff in comparison. Well, I felt that way again with Sleeping Dogs. It feels even more stiff than Saints Row does. This isn't that much of a deterrence since the game offers so many other things, but it is something I think they could improve on for a sequel.Conclusion:Overall, this game was worth every penny. If you enjoy games like GTA or Saints Row, I think there's a good chance you'll enjoy this as well. The graphics, the gameplay and the story are all excellent. There's a lot of things that will keep you busy. If you're hesitant, I would still wait for a good sale like I did. It's definitely worth a try.			",253,110,24,15,33,5,6

												An Asian Kung Fu Version of Grand Theft Auto. Although most will disagree that there are no stripper bars in this game, there are clubs and such. In comparison and contrast, GTA has ""whacked out♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Not as much as Saints Row. But still whacked out mini games. Sleeping Dogs invites you to a story of Wei Shen, an American-Chinese undercover cop who goes under the disguise of his childhood friend Jackie. His mission is to exploit the traids and ruin their operations (Drugs, etc.). During this story, the player will feel conflicted emotions from the events that happen to Wei. The combat system is a second recommendation from me after Batman Arkham City. There are multiple ways to take down enemies and there are tournaments for those who are thirsty for a beatdown. This game is brutal and is recommended for those who enjoyed GTA and Batman Arkham City. I have enjoyed the game incredibly and played through multiple times. (More on X-box). There are many dlcs for this game which I also bought and have not regretted. Buy this game when it is on sale. Since the dlc collection is huge. :)			",232,25,11,22,8,0,15

												If you have ever wished you were a fast talking Chinese-American cop who is less ""undercover"" and more ""dangerously unhinged"" United Front Games (and about a dozen other studios and publishers over the course of a decade) have finally enabled your fantasy. Walk the streets of Hong Kong and grievously injure innocent pedestrians with your kung-fu while they recite authentic Chinese dialog such as ""You like pork-bun, yes?"" and ""...Please help!"". Watch protagonist Wei Shen rail against the Triads to his police superiors and then run over 40 fellow officers on the way to his date with real American actress Emma Stone. It is not all fun and games though; your buddies in uniform(who don't have the everyday stress of having to randomly murder civilians for no reason) will kind of try and put a stop to your rampages. But no matter how many of them you kill no one turns you into Human Resources for creating a hostile work enviroment.Seriously though it is a great game.			",143,37,3,57,25,1,28

The story is well-crafted, the characters are awesome, the gameplay — especially combat — is outstanding, and it has its equal measures of laughter and powerful dramatic moments. If you're a big fan of open-world RPGs like GTA and Saint's Row, I highly recommend this game, as well as the Zodiac Tournament, Nightmare in North Point, and Wheels of Fury DLC packages.

												Definetelly the best open-world game in my opinion !The idea of Sleeping Dogs is very excited and well executed.You are playing as an undercover cop and your mission is to infiltrate Triad and make some friends among their leaders.In the same time you can not forget that you're a cop and you have to arrange secret meetings with your police fellows ,make some phonecalls or send text message when you need to.The graphics is amazing ,and so is the game phisique ,especially seen during a street fights which occur very often.I have never seen well executed fight scenes as here in Sleeping Dogs .It's not about blind clicking your mouse .(of course you need to use it ) .To become a supreme street brawler you will need need to use counter strikes ,blocks ,throws ,and a lot of combinations to tackle your opponent down ,brake his legs or arm ,or crack hes jaw:) eventually throwing him in to a phone booth :)But it is not all about street fights...you will need to track and eliminate other gangs that are a treating Triadyou're in .Pursue competition by car,motorbike ,bus ,or just by using your legs ,go to kung fu school to improve your fighting skills ,eliminating in the same time Triad members silently and without any suspicions.I forgot to mention that while playing Sleeping Dogs you're gaining experience which is converted to skill points.Basicly what you got here is: 2 skill trees :one for doing work for Triad ,and another skill tree for co operarting with cops.Amazing isn't it???:) You can use almost anything to steal the car ,or boat ,hack the CCTV cameras ,harrass Triad competition and even do petty jobs such as destroying sports car or collecting money from shops for so called ""protection""The game is deep ,and has a lot of dimentions.You don't need to follow quests or mission as if  the fun part would depend on those .Take your time ,explore the city ,find hiden suitcases ,try beat your friends record by riding longer on one wheel of your motor bike ,or make the longest car jump in a history of Sleeping Dogs ,and many more fun stuff awaits on you in this awesome game.When you start playing you will not know when to stop!!!:)Love it !!!Dan.

However, had it not been, it wouldn't have been as satisfying as there weren't a lot of ways the loose ends could have been wrapped up. Hopefully Rockstar ""borrows"" some of the gameplay elements for GTAV, though that would have had to be in development before this game was released. Square-Enix should do all PC ports, because they get them right, down to the high resolution texture pack, Steamworks, video options, etc. Thank goodness they saved this game from cancellation.

												After Mafia I & II, Sleeping Dogs is the only game that made me fall in love with it because of the story. I'm an ardent GTA fanatic but when someone mocks this game calling it a GTA rip-off, I seriously get angry. We gotta appreciate the developers for developing a game with an amazing story. The plot, and character development are simply awesome. Kudos to United Front Games.Though the drving was kinda tough for me as I'm used to cruising through the streets of Liberty City in GTA IV, I got used to it. Now I can easily drive through the streets of HK (Yet, I haven't achieved the ""Safe Driver"" achievement :P) I strongly recommend this game to everyone!			",17,3,1,0,0,0,0

												The first GTA-style game I was able to really sink my teeth into since Red Dead Redemption. Great radio choices, fluid melee combat controls, bullet-time gunplay and sorta squishy driving controls all make this into a fun sandbox driving type game. I bothered to get all the trophies in the base game and had a lot of fun while I was doing it.			",130,12,0,11,4,0,4

												Rating: 10/10Story review: Realistic, breath-taking view of Hong Kong mirrored into the game creates an excellent open-world experience that is yet to be chalenged by the likes of GTA.The choreographed fighting, acting, driving and cut scenes are above average, showcasing what is possible when developers take game mechanics seriously and invest in it. The game has a short learning path, even for new comers. You'll get thrown right into action from the first scene, and the nostalgic storyline will keep begging you for a repeat of the story once you're done. Visuals and system requirements: The visuals are stellar, and you will not need to break a bank to build a rig that can play this game. Simply put, if you can play Tomb Raider on Medium settings with DirectX11 features turned on, you'll blaze through this game without breaking a sweat.Stereoscopic 3D via AMD HD3D works out of the box if you have an AMD HD 5000+ GPU connected to a 3D capable monitor via HDMI 1.4a. Depending on your setup, you may need a 3D driver such as Tridef 3D to play it in 3D mode.Personally, I had a blast playing the game and would recommend it highly.			",97,2,5,4,1,0,0

												Another game that is kinda like Grand Theft Auto. Except this ones the Asian version of it. I found it extremely fun. It is single player only, that was a tad bit of a disappointment but the story is dope. You play as Wei Shen, in the beginning you meet up with an old buddy and he ends up being part of the triad, but Wei knew that. You get to play and find out his story and a pretty dope adventure. There is a feature that I really like in this game - stealing cars. It isn't like in GTA or Saints Row where you have to stop the car, get out of the car, get the other person out of the car you're trying to steal, then get in the car and drive away. In this game you simply drive behind the car, when the green arrow pops up, press a button, jump on the moving car, steal the car as its moving and drive away!			",510,96,17,75,24,5,53

												I just finished the game, so all of this is kind of a recent pile of thoughts.The story:Wei Shen, an undercover cop has to get into the Sun On Yee, one of the triads in Hong Kong. Old friends, new friends, lovers, enemies, and bitterness is what follows his mission to the very end, which is one of the greates cliamxes in any games I've ever played so far. It's like a really awesome TV series coming to a satisfying end. The base of the story is a dolig one, which we could see a hundred, maybe a thousand times. But man...they did a wonderful job for making it work better than anything else that follows the same path. You'll feel the friends in the game are truly your friends - and their betrayal will hurt you even more. You'll find yourself cheering when something turns out great, and feel anger you never thought you could ever feel. While you don't have much choices storylinewise, the one you get will be usually the best. You'll kill when you need, but feel guilty for it, when you did not. And what makes it all possible?The characters. Wei Shen is a really great protagonist for a game like this. A cop, who has lots of friends from his childhood in the triads, but his supervisor gives him the orders. You'll feel the weight of the things he has to go through, and you'll even feel sorry for him some times. And thus, the payoff will be the better because all of this. Then you have people who knew Wei from his childhood. Jackie, who appears to be the comedic sidekick, but he is indeed much more. A loyal friend, a brother in arms who'll be by your side every time. Then there's Winston, the Red Pole (triad rank), who was first a bit skeptical about you, but he'll become a good friend too. You'll understand him, and you'll ultimately feel sorry for him. And that was just two of the many great and memorable characters from the game.The writing is really good. It's logical, the interactions between the characters are genuine, you know that it was written by someone who can create good characters, and instead of making them do what needs to be done, he or she just creates them, puts them into Hong Kong, and watch what do they do. There are fillers in the discussions between the characters, but they feel anything but forced. They are chatting, enjoying themselves, nothing serious. Just what you'd do if you were roaming the city with your best friend riding shotgun.Overall the story, characters, game concept, and writing gets a 10/10 - really enjoyable, and I'm sure even folks who are not into the moral dilemmas of being an undercover cop will find the game interesting.Gameplay:It follows the road GTA has set up (or at least as far as I know, but it could happen that it wasn't the first game like this), third person view, open world, sandbox feeling, etc. If you played any GTA games, from III to V, you are familiar with the concept. But instead of guns, the emphasis is more on the fistfights. Wei can learn tons of new moves, each associated with a ""reputation tree"", one for the Triads, one for the Police, and the third for your old martial arts master, Sifu. You get experience in each mission for both factions, depending on your accomplishments - if you didn't break anything, and didn't kill or hurt any civilians, you get more Police XP, while killing more enemies, especially with enviromental kills will reward you more Triad xp. For Sifu, you need to find his jade statues, and he'll teach you a new move for every one of them. The melee system is not too complicated. You have a bunch of combos, and about four buttons to use. It's like the melee system of Batman, but without the gadgets, and with more brutal fightning moves. Roundkicks, breaking arms and legs, throwing them off a building, you get everything you need. I mentioned enviromental kills, which need some explaining, I'm afraid. When you grab an enemy, you can see some items with blinking red lights. You can perform enviromental kills on them, like throwing the poor guy on a bunch of swordfish heads, or roasting his head on an oven. Even tho there aren't as much emphasis on the guns, they are still present. They aren't too many of them, but they are a great deal of fun. You can use covers, and go all John Woo on your enemies' asses. Slow down time, jump through tables, and earn more time slowing for shooting them in the head. Firefights will play like an action movie, such a shame there aren't a bit more of them in the game. Most of the big turning points of the game involve a lot of guns and enemies, which will make the blood run faster in your veins. The open world is wonderful. I've never been to Hong Kong, and haven't seen too much pictures of it, but if it looks like this, then hot damn, what an awesome city. It looks really good. And with all the people going aroudn, doing their daily routine, it becomes even better. In the daytime the streets are crowded, while the night is relatively quiet, and only a few people are running around. And most of them belong to one or another gang, so be careful.There are lots of hidden, or not so hidden altars around the city. Pray at them, and for every 5th you visit, your health will increase a bit. A great fun, and they feel the part of the city.Also, there are a lot of minigames, which I haven't discovered in their entirety. You can race with cars, bet on chicken fights, play mahjonng poker, etcetera etcetera. They are worth checking out, and maybe you'll find them as engaging as the main game and storyline itself.Overall, for gameplay, I'd give a 9/10 - only because I'm sure there are mistakes here and there, but it's so recent i'm still under the effect of the game.Graphics:I don't want to talk about this as much as the other parts, as I don't really watch the graphics of the game. It's in harmony with the other parts of the game, and this is awesome. The characters' animations are great, you can spot really lifelike impressions on them.Let's say non-rated/10, I haven't got the hardware to see it's full potential.Sounds:Various radio stations in the cars, and great enviromental sounds when you are not in a vehicle. Both of them are good, and I'm sure everybody will find a radio station he likes. From techno, to J-pop, from classical to death metal. They got your taste covered. 10/10Multiplayer/co-op:Non-existent, you can only see if in specific areas you did better than your friends or not. Longest time driven without accidents, and so forth. I don't think that's necessary, but could have been a welcomed addition to the game.Overall? I'd give this game a 9 out of 10. A joy to play, and I didn't get frustrated at any part on normal. It was a fluid game, that really worth my money. I got it on a sale, but if you don't want to wait to try it, get it for the full price - you won't regret it. Many hours of fun, with minigames, side missions, or just plain exploring.			",374,65,25,69,40,5,112

												This game was brilliant. Much better than other titles that Square Enix has made that are not Final Fantasy such as Just Cause which has serious audio syncing problems. Combat system closely related to that of Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkam City. graphics are quite impressive. But besides the great fighting mechanics, the endless amount of things that you can do in Hong Kong, the customisation with clothes and the many many cars there are to purchase and show off. What is most impressive about this has to definitely be the storyline. Unlike typical games of this genre such as Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row, the main protagnanist of the game,  Wei Shen, is not just a character that comes off as just the average, out to get money and destroy stuff for the sake of it. Wei Shen is the heart of the game. He is a well respected polie offica with the San Fransico police department that heads back to his home city, Hong Kong, to try and assist the local PD with taking down the Traids in the citty. It is immediatly obvious that your character has history with a fair amount of the people in the Traids, seeing as they use one of your oldest friends, Jackie to get Wei into the Triads to begin his undercover operation. Though as Shen gets pulled further in to the seedy underground workings of Hong Kong. It becomes more apparent that his motives of ether helping the police take down the Traids, or working with the Triads become extremely blurred. In conclusion, as I have seen with other reviews of this game, we are all confused as to why people are not paying enough attention to this brilliant title. Yes there are a few bugs in the game, but what game doesn't. Even if you do not like the look of the game, I absolutely recommend this game just for it;s in depth and ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" storyline.			",155,5,2,19,3,1,16

												I've done pretty much everything there is to do in this game, and I can conclusively say it's my favorite crime sandbox I've ever played. The story is well-crafted, the characters are awesome, the gameplay — especially combat — is outstanding, and it has its equal measures of laughter and powerful dramatic moments. If you're a big fan of open-world RPGs like GTA and Saint's Row, I highly recommend this game, as well as the Zodiac Tournament, Nightmare in North Point, and Wheels of Fury DLC packages.

												Definetelly the best open-world game in my opinion !The idea of Sleeping Dogs is very excited and well executed.You are playing as an undercover cop and your mission is to infiltrate Triad and make some friends among their leaders.In the same time you can not forget that you're a cop and you have to arrange secret meetings with your police fellows ,make some phonecalls or send text message when you need to.The graphics is amazing ,and so is the game phisique ,especially seen during a street fights which occur very often.I have never seen well executed fight scenes as here in Sleeping Dogs .It's not about blind clicking your mouse .(of course you need to use it ) .To become a supreme street brawler you will need need to use counter strikes ,blocks ,throws ,and a lot of combinations to tackle your opponent down ,brake his legs or arm ,or crack hes jaw:) eventually throwing him in to a phone booth :)But it is not all about street fights...you will need to track and eliminate other gangs that are a treating Triadyou're in .Pursue competition by car,motorbike ,bus ,or just by using your legs ,go to kung fu school to improve your fighting skills ,eliminating in the same time Triad members silently and without any suspicions.I forgot to mention that while playing Sleeping Dogs you're gaining experience which is converted to skill points.Basicly what you got here is: 2 skill trees :one for doing work for Triad ,and another skill tree for co operarting with cops.Amazing isn't it???:) You can use almost anything to steal the car ,or boat ,hack the CCTV cameras ,harrass Triad competition and even do petty jobs such as destroying sports car or collecting money from shops for so called ""protection""The game is deep ,and has a lot of dimentions.You don't need to follow quests or mission as if  the fun part would depend on those .Take your time ,explore the city ,find hiden suitcases ,try beat your friends record by riding longer on one wheel of your motor bike ,or make the longest car jump in a history of Sleeping Dogs ,and many more fun stuff awaits on you in this awesome game.When you start playing you will not know when to stop!!!:)Love it !!!Dan.

Great port as opposed to another open world crime game (cough GTA IV), with a cool fighting system and great handling cars/bikes (unlike GTA IV). Story is good but nothing really all that memorable. Physics are unrealistic but absolutely hilarious.Combat is quite similar to the Batman Arkham games ableit doesnt flow as well, but you have the ablity to use the environment against opponents as well as pistols, shotguns and smg's later.

												This game is honestly very underated by a lot of people. It was one of a select few games compelling enough I did a second play through almost immediatly after beating it for the first time. The other reason I did a second playthrough was because I wanted to finish off the achievments for the game and it was a more fun way to do it compared to running around farming stats rewards.That however is against the point this game has a host of extremely talented voice actors who make the characters that much more believable and relateable. These voice actors also further the story and push you to spend the time and help them out. The DLC for this game though mostly cosmetic has a few gems that give you more missions to complete around the map and a few kinda stand alone storylines. At the end of the day this is a game I tell all my friends they should buy because it is quite simply amazing.			",384,90,12,55,29,1,46

												This is one good open world game.It's set in a beautifully designed city,with lots of interesting places.It is worth it for just exploring this city.The game is centered around melee fighting and not so much around guns.The fighting system is similiar to Assassin's Creed games but far superior in my opinion.The guns are boring and during the sections of the game that you must use guns,I felt bored and I wished It would end just so I could kick someone with my bare fists.The main story is good and you will surely focus on it because it is interesting and has some nice twists.But the world does not lack side quests and other activities which can keep you occupied during or after finishing the story.Driving feels weird at first but you just need to get used to it.This is a solid game that should be on everyone's list.

												Thought the game didn't copy the entire Hong Kong, but if you want to discover it virtually or in a game, buy the game.I like how many DLCs did this game have, and killing civillians are so fun with it's combat system. (Ignore how cruel am I.) The skills system not just giving you some skills, but also change the way you fight with the enemies also.One of the reasons I bought it is the game have more than 3 kinds of missions avaliable, undercover and traids mission arr the mains. You can also find the race missions which depends on the vehicle types and classes from your garage.And also the game have a feature that isn't really avaliable in Grand Theft Auto (no, I like this series also), and that feature is the game allow you to access any parking services (maybe it shall be called like that?) across the main island and take your own cars or motorbikes you bought before and keep them inside, you can always get a same car from it infinitely. Thought you can't steal a car and take it back to your parking service garage, but since the main character is used to have a police background, it's okay.			",130,16,2,4,20,0,11

												A good Alternative to modern sandbox games (GTAIV, SR3..) Sleeping Dogs is more of a KungFu Brawler that inherits traits from games like Shemnue and Double Dragon. Guns sequences include some slow mo action to keep the shooting fun. Games look great,  sound great and the story will keep you interested. Sleeping Dogs could have been a good Hong Kong Kung Fu flick. I'm greatful they made it a game instead!			",840,350,28,110,103,7,142

												This is a GTA clone that is strangely better than GTA itself =) I've enjoyed Sleeping Dogs so much more than GTA IV, and even bought three story DLCs to continue immersing myself in game's great atmosphere. I also went for the 100% percent completion - something I rarely do nowadays.So, if you love GTA, you'll love this game. If you don't - you should still try it. You will be surprised by how good it is =)			",262,90,10,22,25,1,16

												With the success of open-world titles such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row and Just Cause, developer United Front Games had big hopes for True Crime: Hong Kong, set to be published by Activision. Wait – True Crime? Yes. You could say the development story around this game might be more interesting than the in-game story.Hoping to reinvigorate the True Crime series, Activision had plans to merge United Front Games’ newest title into it – even going as far as announcing it and releasing a trailer (and eventually changing the naming to just “True Crime“). As time went on, and delays plagued the release, Activision gave up on the project. Some rumors state that the game was almost finished, and could even be completed by players in its current state.To the angst of gamers everywhere, with thoughts of what could have been, this happens often in game development. What also happens on occasion is that another publisher will spot the diamond in the rough, inherit the project, and ultimately publish it. That’s what happened here; when Square Enix first laid its eyes on the game, it’s been said that it was a done deal right from the get-go. There have even been quotes from Square Enix calling Activision “crazy” for abandoning not only a game so far in its development cycle, but a game with such potential.Those who enjoy open-world games such as the titles mentioned above will be pleased with Square Enix’s decision on this one, because Sleeping Dogs is a great game, offering just enough uniqueness to set itself apart from the games it’s going to inevitably be compared to time and time again.What’s not so unique is its story, but it involves a not-so-unique mechanic that makes it unique (get that?). You’re Wei Shen, a Hong Kong-born undercover cop that lived in America for so long that his accent is almost non-existent. Back in Hong Kong, Shen’s job is to get in good with the Triad gang Sun On Yee (based on the real-life gang Sun Yee On) and ultimately take it down.Throughout the game, Shen will have to perform duties for both his gang and the police department, and as missions are completed, XP will be earned for the respective skill tree (Triad or Police). Each of these are split into two sections, and as each level is earned, you’ll be able to unlock the next available skill in either section.Where the unique comes in is that ultimately, you may sway more to one side than the other, depending on your playstyle. When on a police mission, if you run into people or damage the environment, XP is taken away from that tree. This doesn’t matter much, as Police XP comes easier than Triad XP. In addition to these there’s also a “Face” tree, which is leveled up based on various actions throughout the game; when a new level is earned here, it adds a new self-benefiting ability, such as having buffs last longer.Buffs, you ask? Yes, Sleeping Dogs is more RPG-like than most other open-world games, with the game coming close to the mechanics Saints Row 3. By either eating or partaking in some activity, Shen can earn buffs that increase his damage, helps him regenerate health or boost other abilities. Each buff disappears after a certain amount of time; faster if it’s more beneficial. While it’d be nice given the difficulty of some fights, there are no healing items that Shen can keep on him.One thing that sets this game apart is that it takes place in Hong Kong, while most open-world games, such as Grand Theft Auto, Mafia II and Saints Row, take place in more Americanized locations. If you’re indifferent to Asia, this might not matter, but if you do happen to love the cities of any Asian metropolis, you’re going to be pleased with the world here. I’d argue that this is the most detailed open-world game ever, as the cities feel genuine with their layouts and design, and rarely did I stumble on anything that I knew was a direct copy / paste (things like advertisements aside).Adding to the realism, most of the NPCs in the game speak Cantonese with no subtitles, while all important characters speak in clear English with occasional Cantonese thrown in. This is appreciated, and to me, required. It’d feel a bit odd to traverse through Hong Kong and never hear the official language.			",187,27,17,14,24,1,27

												Sleeping Dogs - another GTA like game. At first glance, everything is as usual: shooting, chase, mission, gangsters, police patrol, sex, drugs and rock and roll =).But after 2 hours of the game, we find ourselves in the real Hong Kong with his daily events and people. City shows quite clearly. Victoria Peak - the beauty of which burn out like a snake. Beauty.Beauty yacht in the Night.Beautiful yachts, nightclubs, classical Chinese markets. All this is done really well and is exactly what if you find yourself in Hong Kong at present.Honestly - I like many was not in China, except in Japan. I'm a fighter - karate.And as a fighter, I can say that the fight scenes, strikes, movements are done very thoroughly. Thanks to the developers for the respect for the martial arts. Thank you also for respect for religion! Ceremonial urn, Buddha Temple, the monks - all in the game. And the plot of the game dramatically and exciting! Good cop bad.Unfortunately events in the game are very real. War and bloodshed triad goes every day. Control of the territory, drugs, weapons. This game shows us ""both sides of the coin.""10 out of 10. Best game of martial arts. Thx to all			",70,9,0,7,2,0,6

Posted: May 5, 2014
												I just finished the game, so all of this is kind of a recent pile of thoughts.The story:Wei Shen, an undercover cop has to get into the Sun On Yee, one of the triads in Hong Kong. Old friends, new friends, lovers, enemies, and bitterness is what follows his mission to the very end, which is one of the greates cliamxes in any games I've ever played so far. It's like a really awesome TV series coming to a satisfying end. The base of the story is a dolig one, which we could see a hundred, maybe a thousand times. But man...they did a wonderful job for making it work better than anything else that follows the same path. You'll feel the friends in the game are truly your friends - and their betrayal will hurt you even more. You'll find yourself cheering when something turns out great, and feel anger you never thought you could ever feel. While you don't have much choices storylinewise, the one you get will be usually the best. You'll kill when you need, but feel guilty for it, when you did not. And what makes it all possible?The characters. Wei Shen is a really great protagonist for a game like this. A cop, who has lots of friends from his childhood in the triads, but his supervisor gives him the orders. You'll feel the weight of the things he has to go through, and you'll even feel sorry for him some times. And thus, the payoff will be the better because all of this. Then you have people who knew Wei from his childhood. Jackie, who appears to be the comedic sidekick, but he is indeed much more. A loyal friend, a brother in arms who'll be by your side every time. Then there's Winston, the Red Pole (triad rank), who was first a bit skeptical about you, but he'll become a good friend too. You'll understand him, and you'll ultimately feel sorry for him. And that was just two of the many great and memorable characters from the game.The writing is really good. It's logical, the interactions between the characters are genuine, you know that it was written by someone who can create good characters, and instead of making them do what needs to be done, he or she just creates them, puts them into Hong Kong, and watch what do they do. There are fillers in the discussions between the characters, but they feel anything but forced. They are chatting, enjoying themselves, nothing serious. Just what you'd do if you were roaming the city with your best friend riding shotgun.Overall the story, characters, game concept, and writing gets a 10/10 - really enjoyable, and I'm sure even folks who are not into the moral dilemmas of being an undercover cop will find the game interesting.Gameplay:It follows the road GTA has set up (or at least as far as I know, but it could happen that it wasn't the first game like this), third person view, open world, sandbox feeling, etc. If you played any GTA games, from III to V, you are familiar with the concept. But instead of guns, the emphasis is more on the fistfights. Wei can learn tons of new moves, each associated with a ""reputation tree"", one for the Triads, one for the Police, and the third for your old martial arts master, Sifu. You get experience in each mission for both factions, depending on your accomplishments - if you didn't break anything, and didn't kill or hurt any civilians, you get more Police XP, while killing more enemies, especially with enviromental kills will reward you more Triad xp. For Sifu, you need to find his jade statues, and he'll teach you a new move for every one of them. The melee system is not too complicated. You have a bunch of combos, and about four buttons to use. It's like the melee system of Batman, but without the gadgets, and with more brutal fightning moves. Roundkicks, breaking arms and legs, throwing them off a building, you get everything you need. I mentioned enviromental kills, which need some explaining, I'm afraid. When you grab an enemy, you can see some items with blinking red lights. You can perform enviromental kills on them, like throwing the poor guy on a bunch of swordfish heads, or roasting his head on an oven. Even tho there aren't as much emphasis on the guns, they are still present. They aren't too many of them, but they are a great deal of fun. You can use covers, and go all John Woo on your enemies' asses. Slow down time, jump through tables, and earn more time slowing for shooting them in the head. Firefights will play like an action movie, such a shame there aren't a bit more of them in the game. Most of the big turning points of the game involve a lot of guns and enemies, which will make the blood run faster in your veins. The open world is wonderful. I've never been to Hong Kong, and haven't seen too much pictures of it, but if it looks like this, then hot damn, what an awesome city. It looks really good. And with all the people going aroudn, doing their daily routine, it becomes even better. In the daytime the streets are crowded, while the night is relatively quiet, and only a few people are running around. And most of them belong to one or another gang, so be careful.There are lots of hidden, or not so hidden altars around the city. Pray at them, and for every 5th you visit, your health will increase a bit. A great fun, and they feel the part of the city.Also, there are a lot of minigames, which I haven't discovered in their entirety. You can race with cars, bet on chicken fights, play mahjonng poker, etcetera etcetera. They are worth checking out, and maybe you'll find them as engaging as the main game and storyline itself.Overall, for gameplay, I'd give a 9/10 - only because I'm sure there are mistakes here and there, but it's so recent i'm still under the effect of the game.Graphics:I don't want to talk about this as much as the other parts, as I don't really watch the graphics of the game. It's in harmony with the other parts of the game, and this is awesome. The characters' animations are great, you can spot really lifelike impressions on them.Let's say non-rated/10, I haven't got the hardware to see it's full potential.Sounds:Various radio stations in the cars, and great enviromental sounds when you are not in a vehicle. Both of them are good, and I'm sure everybody will find a radio station he likes. From techno, to J-pop, from classical to death metal. They got your taste covered. 10/10Multiplayer/co-op:Non-existent, you can only see if in specific areas you did better than your friends or not. Longest time driven without accidents, and so forth. I don't think that's necessary, but could have been a welcomed addition to the game.Overall? I'd give this game a 9 out of 10. A joy to play, and I didn't get frustrated at any part on normal. It was a fluid game, that really worth my money. I got it on a sale, but if you don't want to wait to try it, get it for the full price - you won't regret it. Many hours of fun, with minigames, side missions, or just plain exploring.			",374,65,25,69,40,5,112

												This game was brilliant. Much better than other titles that Square Enix has made that are not Final Fantasy such as Just Cause which has serious audio syncing problems. Combat system closely related to that of Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkam City. graphics are quite impressive. But besides the great fighting mechanics, the endless amount of things that you can do in Hong Kong, the customisation with clothes and the many many cars there are to purchase and show off. What is most impressive about this has to definitely be the storyline. Unlike typical games of this genre such as Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row, the main protagnanist of the game,  Wei Shen, is not just a character that comes off as just the average, out to get money and destroy stuff for the sake of it. Wei Shen is the heart of the game. He is a well respected polie offica with the San Fransico police department that heads back to his home city, Hong Kong, to try and assist the local PD with taking down the Traids in the citty. It is immediatly obvious that your character has history with a fair amount of the people in the Traids, seeing as they use one of your oldest friends, Jackie to get Wei into the Triads to begin his undercover operation. Though as Shen gets pulled further in to the seedy underground workings of Hong Kong. It becomes more apparent that his motives of ether helping the police take down the Traids, or working with the Triads become extremely blurred. In conclusion, as I have seen with other reviews of this game, we are all confused as to why people are not paying enough attention to this brilliant title. Yes there are a few bugs in the game, but what game doesn't. Even if you do not like the look of the game, I absolutely recommend this game just for it;s in depth and ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" storyline.			",155,5,2,19,3,1,16

												I've never played GTA. But the thought of a GTA-like game set in Asia was awesome, not enough games like this are set here.The game world is fairly vibrant, and the art style is interesting. The gameplay is fun too, except I hated all the shooting sequences - I had to switch to the keyboard and mouse for them.There's also a slight issue I run into if my joystick is connected as well; Sleeping Dogs for some reason ends up switching partially to the joystick and ignores the 360 controller and partly ignores the kb/mouse. I asked Square Enix support, they said it wont be fixed.Story wise it's okay, the only slight issue I had was the number of women Wei gets to sleep with for no obvious reason at all. Reminded me a bit of The Witcher's card game.Anyway, I had quite a bit of fun in the game.			",47,4,2,1,11,0,12

												After 60 hours in this games world.. I can safely say that this game is definitely for me.Sleeping Dogs is the story of Wei Shen a cop deep within Hong Kong's crime syndicate, so deep he doesn't know who's side he is on any more. All he knows is honour and respect are the most important things and he will keep to those values.Sleeping Dogs is a fantastic open world sandbox game, its gameplay mechanics and mesmerizing world combined make an experience that is overall rewarding and entertaining from the beginning to when you are finished with it, Whether it be a 20 hour playthrough of only the story or if you're like me and enjoyed the game enough and had the time to collect and unlock everything in the game in a 60+ hour playthrough. No matter what you are going to enjoy Sleeping Dogs if you are a fan of the open world genre.The game looks and sounds fantastic the best looking the game will get is at night with rain, its one of the most visually appealing sandbox games out there. A lot of people will probably have problems with the amount of limitations the game has... you can't fly planes or helicopters the driving is almost arcade (which I kind of respect in a world where every open world game is trying to be realistic with its driving ) and there isn't a jump button.. but when you play Sleeping Dogs you will see how those problems don't even matter instead of jumping the game will give you moments while running to jump to another rooftop or vault over and parkour the environment. I didn't really feel like flying a plane or helicopter would benefit the game at all.The combat is a nice remix of the Batman: Arkham Franchise's free flow combat and its a nice new take on that style of combat. You feel like you are in a Hong Kong action movie, with various environmental and up close takedown moves.A small but decent range of melee weapons and firearms the combat in Sleeping Dogs is very well done. That being said you will be doing more punching and kicking then shooting.. but that's in the games favour as I feel the melee combat towers of the shooting mechanics which are still pretty fun.The collectables in this game never really feel like chores because each one gets you closer and closer to unlocking more items or maxing out your health bar so even players who don't normally enjoy collecting will find themselves doing it anyway.. So I thought that was a pretty nice way to do the collecting side of things.I'm not a fan of DLC I hate the idea of it but I can find my self enjoying DLC whenever I somehow find my self playing it.Sleeping Dogs has three DLC missions and all three are great, one has Wei Shen return to being a beat cop and in full uniform to take down a cult that has made its way to Hong Kong and bomb certain areas. Another has Wei make his way to a fighting tournament on an island off the coast of Hong Kong.. and if you didn't think it could get anymore ridiculous there is a full on Halloween themed mission involving Wei rescuing his girlfriend from demon's and ghosts in the Northpoint of Kong Kong.The game looks, plays and sounds fantastically. If you are a fan of the sandbox genre then you would be a fool to miss this gem.			",362,44,2,29,15,1,21

												Better than GTA IV.In Sleeping Dogs your playing as Wei Shen who is an undercover cop infiltrating the Triads in Hong Kong. This setting is way more interesting than the generic gangster setting of GTA IV or V. You will encounter a lot of Plot Twists and intresting characters, the melee combat is a lot like the free flow system of the batman games & the driving is easy to handle and feels great.All in all i can recommend this game to everybody who likes games like GTA but with a better story.- Jay			",170,9,3,27,14,3,30

												When I heard about this game, I was hesitant to get it due to the fact that it wasn't as hyped as a GTA or a Saints Row and I didn't want to be disappointed. However, I knew I liked these types of games so I took a chance on it while it was on sale. I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed.Story:You assume the role of Wei Shen, an undercover police officer sent to infiltrate and take down the Sun On Yee, a traid organization based in Hong Kong. Wei deals with the inner conflict of being a cop, while proving himself to the Triads in order to gain their trust and complete his mission. Unfortunately, in order to gain the trust of the Triads, Wei must go against his moral code. It's only a matter of time before Wei gets in too deep.Gameplay:Sleeping Dogs isn't just a GTA or Saints Row clone. It brings something different to the genre. It doesn't feel like a generic recreation of the previously mentioned, more established frachises. This game stands out on it's own with the addition of kung-fu melee fighting, parkour, chase sequences and a conflicting story. Other than the main story, there's side missions, races, drug busts, fight clubs and more. There's also an abundance of collectibles to find throughout the map. On top of that, there's four different skill trees that allow you to upgrade your abilities as you complete missions and activities. The melee fighting is really fun. You're not just blocking, reversing and throwing punches. You can use your environment to your advantage. Some of the environmental kills are brutal. Throw your opponents off a roof, or into an eel tank or impale them onto some meat hooks. There's also several types of melee weapons to use such as crowbars, machetes, tire irons, etc. If the use of guns in these types of games are a necessity to you, this game may not be for you. There are certain missions that will require firearms, but the majority of combat is melee fighting. I would estimate the melee-to-gun combat ratio is about 70/30. Guns are somewhat uncommon. This is even mentioned in the story. However, that's something I actually liked about the game. You had to play differently than you would in a GTA or a Saints Row.The Negatives:I only have two complaints with this game. Firstly, the main story is a bit short. There's only about 30 main story missions. Once I beat the game and watched the ending cutscenes, I thought they could have milked out two or three more missions. Instead, they seemed to rush the end of the story and summarize it in cutscenes. The other complaint I have is the driving. It feels very stiff. I remember when I played the first Saints Row after playing nothing but GTA games and the driving felt so stiff in comparison. Well, I felt that way again with Sleeping Dogs. It feels even more stiff than Saints Row does. This isn't that much of a deterrence since the game offers so many other things, but it is something I think they could improve on for a sequel.Conclusion:Overall, this game was worth every penny. If you enjoy games like GTA or Saints Row, I think there's a good chance you'll enjoy this as well. The graphics, the gameplay and the story are all excellent. There's a lot of things that will keep you busy. If you're hesitant, I would still wait for a good sale like I did. It's definitely worth a try.			",253,110,24,15,33,5,6

												Solid, fun game. Like GTA but set in Hong Kong with a heavy focus on hand-to-hand combat. Great port as opposed to another open world crime game (cough GTA IV), with a cool fighting system and great handling cars/bikes (unlike GTA IV). Story is good but nothing really all that memorable. Physics are unrealistic but absolutely hilarious.Combat is quite similar to the Batman Arkham games ableit doesnt flow as well, but you have the ablity to use the environment against opponents as well as pistols, shotguns and smg's later. Again great, fun game.			",542,89,29,54,49,6,86

												Wow, what a game! If you love open world games with excellent storytelling, amazing melee combat, great gun-play, and white knuckled driving sequences...look no further. I was a fan of the True Crime series, but this is the evolution I wanted to see in these games. Taking the best parts of other similar games, United Front has really made it their own and an absolutely polished gem. The graphics (full out) on PC are breathtaking and the amount of detail in the world, and the speed at which this detail can go rushing by, is a sight to behold.I was addicted from the moment it started and spent every spare moment playing the game until the intense and satisfying conclusion. A graphical feast with truly lifelike audio, excellent acting, and a strong storyline made me care about the characters in the game like few others.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've done pretty much everything there is to do in this game, and I can conclusively say it's my favorite crime sandbox I've ever played. The story is well-crafted, the characters are awesome, the gameplay — especially combat — is outstanding, and it has its equal measures of laughter and powerful dramatic moments. If you're a big fan of open-world RPGs like GTA and Saint's Row, I highly recommend this game, as well as the Zodiac Tournament, Nightmare in North Point, and Wheels of Fury DLC packages.

												Definetelly the best open-world game in my opinion !The idea of Sleeping Dogs is very excited and well executed.You are playing as an undercover cop and your mission is to infiltrate Triad and make some friends among their leaders.In the same time you can not forget that you're a cop and you have to arrange secret meetings with your police fellows ,make some phonecalls or send text message when you need to.The graphics is amazing ,and so is the game phisique ,especially seen during a street fights which occur very often.I have never seen well executed fight scenes as here in Sleeping Dogs .It's not about blind clicking your mouse .(of course you need to use it ) .To become a supreme street brawler you will need need to use counter strikes ,blocks ,throws ,and a lot of combinations to tackle your opponent down ,brake his legs or arm ,or crack hes jaw:) eventually throwing him in to a phone booth :)But it is not all about street fights...you will need to track and eliminate other gangs that are a treating Triadyou're in .Pursue competition by car,motorbike ,bus ,or just by using your legs ,go to kung fu school to improve your fighting skills ,eliminating in the same time Triad members silently and without any suspicions.I forgot to mention that while playing Sleeping Dogs you're gaining experience which is converted to skill points.Basicly what you got here is: 2 skill trees :one for doing work for Triad ,and another skill tree for co operarting with cops.Amazing isn't it???:) You can use almost anything to steal the car ,or boat ,hack the CCTV cameras ,harrass Triad competition and even do petty jobs such as destroying sports car or collecting money from shops for so called ""protection""The game is deep ,and has a lot of dimentions.You don't need to follow quests or mission as if  the fun part would depend on those .Take your time ,explore the city ,find hiden suitcases ,try beat your friends record by riding longer on one wheel of your motor bike ,or make the longest car jump in a history of Sleeping Dogs ,and many more fun stuff awaits on you in this awesome game.When you start playing you will not know when to stop!!!:)Love it !!!Dan.

												Third-person open-worldy action game, with hand-to-hand fighting sequences as well as shootouts. Has an engaging storyline and interesting characters, but really, driving around Hong Kong is some of the best fun I've ever had.I'd give this a 9.5 out of 10--the missing 0.5 being the weird collision detection while driving. Sometimes you'll be going full speed with a motorcycle and hit the sidewalk that you can normally walk over will sometimes clip your bike so that you fly into the air. Doesn't happen that much but has a tendency to happen when you least want it to, like when you're doing race events.			",416,120,1,115,24,1,36

												GTA: China, or so I Imagined Sleeping Dogs like that when i first heard about it but it's so much more than that. Of course it is like GTA in china in a way, but it doesn't fail in a storytelling like GTA 4 did. The game takes major influence from movies The Departed and Infernal Affairs where the line between friend and foe gets blurred and character loyalties and movies are questioned. The protagonist, Wei Shen is an undercover cop in Hong Kong who sworn uphold the law and bring criminals to justice but by virtue of being undercover which is also a gangster comiting very real acts of of crime. He has a personal vendetta against drug pushing triads for what they did to his sister and he sworn to take them down. It's a game about dealing with conflicting aspects of self. And what is interesting you don't have to chose between those aspects. It's a game about living with and reconsiling the fact that you have theese identities. The best straightforward example of this is you get 2 different EXP bars after each mission, the triad and cop. Triad exp fills with every kill you make, the more brutal the better, headshots, explosions fill up that bar while cop exp punish you for being clumsy or killing hostage etc. it implies that Wei is a good cop at the begining of the mission and going down morally doing his job. It's a game where protagonist doing the triad and cop things and he has to live up with consequences and it's show in game every time Wei goes to sleep. I think it's a good game and worth your attention 8/10.			",61,11,0,4,2,0,2

Posted: December 30, 2013
												TL;DR- 8/10, fun game despite a few flaws.I've heard this game reffered to as ""a poor man's Grand Theft Auto"". And while the moniker may come across as derogatory, I can't disagree. Certain aspects of Sleeping Dogs draw from open world titans like GTA, but it still manages to stand tall of its own merits, rather than on the coattails of GTA.The pros are that it is a legitimately fun game to play. The story was interesting enough to keep me engaged and wanting to dig deeper, combat handled pretty well and was easy to learn, and a lot of the special actions you can perform, such as mid-driving carjacking, are pretty fun to pull off. The dual experience system is implemented fairly well, rewarding you for wreaking as much havok as you can upon your enemies, while punishing you for hurting, killing or destroying anything not related to your mission. Environmental hazards give combat a little more pep, allowing you to seriously injure, if not outright slaughter (sometimes quite brutally) anyone standing in your way.The cons are that there isn't a terrible lot to do outside of the story quests, and what little there is to do becomes repetative and tedious with no meaningful reward. Some of the dialogue and situations/resolutions you come across can be pretty tongue-in-cheek if not outright absurd and cheesy, and felt detractive towards the overall tone and feel of the game. Combat, while easy to learn and diverse in what movesets you can punish your enemies with, ultimately boils down only attacking, grabbing or counters, and doesn't encourage making use of the many skills you can learn except for the sake of doing something flashy. NPCs will sometimes get stuck on terrain or on corners, making some missions impossible to complete without a restart.But the two biggest offenders in this game for me, are the vehicle camera controls, and the option to purchase a number of game breaking features from the start through DLC content. The vehicle camera controls can be frustrating at best and damning at worst. It tends to lock itself in whatever position you move it to relative to your vehicle, and doesn't transition back to the forward position when you begin driving unless you move it back yourself, making multi-point turns and complex driving maneuvers aggrivating.The DLC content almost broke the game for me at the start. I'll admit I grabbed the whole shabang without reading about it all when it was on sale, and I wish I had. After the first couple missions, I suddenly found myself awash in an inordinate amount of Cop and Triad XP, Face XP, money, vehicles and items.. enough so that what was supposed to be earned throughout the course of the game was instantly given to me at the start, making personal progression almost non-existant. If that's your sort of thing, then by all means. Otherwise be wary of what DLC you purchase.Despite the cons and my own complaints about the game however, I'm left feeling quite positive about the overall experience. It's no GTA for sure, but I do think it's worth a look and a playthrough.8/10			",72,1,0,8,1,0,1

												Well I bought it while it was on sale and never played it until two weeks ago. It instantly got me. The story is so captivating that I didn't even collect all shrines and statues just because I wanted to continue the storyline, which doesn't happen that often when I play games like this. It is this new situation, not being a gangster like in GTA and all those titles but rather being an undercover cop, always fearing that your cover might be blown up. I will just make a list here to point out what points are outstanding and which are not that great.Pros:-Action Hijack. Holy. Really cool thing, it allows you to hijack someones car just by jumping off your vehicle onto theirs, like in action movies.-Pretty big city.-""Minigames"" like picking locks, hacking codes, tracking handys and so on. Not really challenging but it is a nice gimmick to have in an action game.-The combat system. It's really easy but it still looks pretty cool when you're doing your combos to defeat those 20 triad members.-Not too much shooting. Weapons are pretty rare, you mainly use martial arts to fight foes.-Different culture. The setting is authentic, the voice acting well done, just the traffic sucks.-Very cool characters. Reminds me of Mafia & Mafia II.-The captivating story. Wei Shen (you) gets a bit attached during the story and you can understand him due to what you and the characters go through.-Nice graphics. Nothing outstanding but they fit well. Not comparable to Mafia II though.Cons:-The driving. Meh. Not really dynamic, but it doesn't affect the gameplay too much.-THE TRAFFIC. Who the heck drives on the left side. 10/10 would crash.-The physics. Some things just look really weird especially when you're driving through everything but you suddenly crash because you hit a sidewalk.-Not enough to do besides the story. You don't have that much sidequests but that's totally fine since the story is so good.Conclusion:If you like games like Mafia, Mafia II and GTA Vice City then you're gonna love this game (at least its story). It just feels like a good thriller.			",92,30,2,14,10,0,10

												This game is by far one of my favourites... Whilst not being able to boast what other 'Open World' games can... By god it makes up in content and story, I was ingrossed in this story and it kept me hooked all the way. The gameplay is fun and its beautiful especially with the texture pack on, my only problem with it really is that once it hits end game, other than the limited Dlc... there is not much left to do, however the game was enjoyable enough for me that I played it again! This game is genuinely awesome and I hope they do make a sequel because if they can expand it, it will be the best open world game out there! (Plus Triads cause you know...)			",177,25,8,14,19,3,29

												Sleeping Dogs is a realistic look at the undercover life in the Hong Kong Triads (organized crime) played as a third person open world game. I guess you can compare it to the Grand Theft Auto games or Saints Row games in terms of actual gameplay.  In Sleeping Dogs you’ll find yourself driving in cars for large portions of the game since the game world is actually very large. There’s a fast travel option that I didn’t even know existed until I replayed the game a couple of months ago. The combat in the game is very similar to the Batman Arkham games (strike & counter), but with no gadgets. There are also sections where you’ll use guns, but it’s about 90% hand to hand fighting.Where the game really shines is in story. You’re an undercover cop trying to worm your way into the Triad and slowly get pulled in more and more into the life. It’s how I imagine real undercover cops experience their jobs. Overall I give the game a thumbs up. It seems like every game I review gets a thumbs up, but that’s because if I don’t like a game, I stop playing. Steam offers a free HD textures DLC so everything looks good with the graphics turned way up.  ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												If you are a fan of any one of the many 3rd person open world sandbox games, you will enjoy this game.  I would say that this is slightly above average when it comes to most GTA style games. It suffers from some of the same cliches and fetch quest repetition which can get boring, but there are some quest which break this up. It really is a good thing that this game was saved from limbo and released because it is worth the play through. I'd get the HD dlc patch because with a good setup this game can look very good in places.			",942,322,44,117,96,13,152

												Has the seedy Hong Kong underworld ever called to you? Probably not, but still if you want to imagine being a Triad whilst working for the law then this is the game for you This is a pretty awesome open world GTA style game. It is beautiful to look at and just great fun to walk around and explore. The missions are diverse and plentiful. The story is compelling and very well written. I really felt connected to the characters and invested in what happened to them. And the entire immense story was topped off by a pretty awesome finale.Pretty much every aspect of the gameplay is solid. The driving and combat are robust and feel great. Some of my favourite memories of this game were just driving around the city at full tilt with the cops chasing me shooting out tires and running people off the road. There are a lot of vehicles and each one drives very differently.The combat is great, so much variety and with many ways to beat the hell out of people you won’t get bored. Plus with the ability to learn more skills you will find the fighting even better the further you go. The game also feature contextual take downs, want to slam some guys face into a fan or a window? You can do that and it feels immensely satisfyingThere are also tons of side missions to do such as street racing, gambling and a fight club that you will be busy for hours before even delving into the story itself. Plus with all the available DLC and now the definitive edition you will be able to delve even deeper into what Hong Kong has to offerThis version is no longer available but if I would recommend the definitive edition as it contains even more stuff. If you play this game you will have a great time, it is far superior to its spiritual predecessors and a great intro to a new series. Have fun ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

There are some broken elements of the game unfortunately, but nothing dealbreaker. The story is absolutely fantastic, shame that in the end they give a completely unnecessary plot twist, that adds nothing to the game.Couple this with the nightmare at north point DLC, which may provide a few good laughs and you have yourself a great experience.

												I felt compelled to write a review for Sleeping Dogs, as it is a game that gave me more bang for my buck than most ever have.  I'm a huge fan of open-world games with driving (GTA, Saints Row, Far Cry).  With that said, I 100%'d Sleeping Dogs at about 30 hours in, and my current playtime is now nearing the 118 mark.  I can count the number of games I've 100%'d on less than two hands.  So, I think the important question is, why do I still keep playing?  What caused me to learn this game inside and out, to the point where I know all the mechanics, glitches, and how to mess with every piece of AI?The answer lies in that to me, Sleeping Dogs is just pure fun.  The melee combat is something that almost no other game has done as well, and really the only one that comes to mind is the Arkham series.  Even with Arkham, I find the combat takes too long, whereas in Sleeping Dogs it gets things just right.  It's visceral while remaining simple.  Enemies react in momentary fear to bone-crushing martial arts moves, and the protagonist Wei Shen can masterfully counter and take out hordes of gangsters.  Wei also moves around Hong Kong with basic parkour moves, as he can survive falls of impressive heights and slide over all manner of objects smoothly, if timed right.The other aspect is driving.  Let me preface this section with two things: one, that I vastly prefer arcade style driving (if I want real driving, I'll go take my real car out), and two, the weapon-based DLC car singlehandedly has given me hours upon hours of extra time with the game.  I'll put this bluntly; if you want realistic driving, go play another game.  Ramming cars at high speeds, tearing through the Financial District with a nearly indestructible bus, and blowing out the tires that sends cars flying like a Hollywood movie... all of its is insanely fun.  Add in the DLC car that pretty much breaks the game, and it just gets hilarious how awesomely you can dominate Hong Kong.Sleeping Dogs is far from perfect, however.  Some of the things the game does are laughably bad, like how the police are handled.  I'm not going to mince words here, the police are just terrible.  They're so bad that they're funny, like with how awful horror movies work.  The biggest issue I have is that they literally pop into an area.  You could be in a desolate alley and shoot someone, or beat up a bunch of people in a quiet street with no police anywhere nearby.. and they will literally pop in like they used a portal gun or stepped through a dimensional rift.  If they weren't so easy to shake off and mess with, this would have ruined any sense of immersion the game had.While I thoroughly enjoyed the story with a satisfying ending, which took me about 15-20 hours with exploration and side missions, you could tell that in some sections, the developers did not have the time to implement other features they wanted.  It's pretty obvious that they wanted to include deeper connections to Hong Kong with Wei with how much exploration and collection there were, along with Wei's serial hit-it-and-quit-it attitude with women.  Wei's struggle with his identity and corruption, both in the Triads and the police force, was a compelling reason for me to finish the story, however.Finally, don't let the DLC scare you.  The DLC mostly adds things in to make the game a little more fun, and none of it is necessary whatsoever.  I know some people who wouldn't sneeze at Sleeping Dogs for the amount of DLC it has, but I doubt they ever actually took a look at what it does.  I really believe that Sleeping Dogs is a game that every fan of this genre should play.  Hong Kong's a relatively fresh setting from similar games, and Sleeping Dogs finds its identity in mechanics that are just fun.  Not crazy whacked up purple♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bat fun like Saints Row, and not maniacal, realistic Trevor fun as in GTA, but just super tight, simple, attractive combat with good pacing and a pretty beautiful world.

												Sleeping Dogs is a great game. It has a super fun campaign, entertaining and unpredictable side missions, and an awesome combat system that resembles the Arkham games. I had a great time playing the campaign because there was a lot of variety, fantastic voice acting, relatable characters, and a spectacular story. My only problem with this game is that it isn't very fun to free roam in.This means that after you beat the campaign and most of the side missions, it is boring as heck. Otherwise, I had a great time playing this game. I enjoyed Sleeping Dogs more than most of the GTA games! I highly recommend this game!			",159,17,0,8,6,1,5

												I think Sleeping Dogs is a really fun game.  The story is fast-paced, intense, and intriguing.  The graphics are wonderful, the atmosphere wonderful with some humor thrown in.  The music that plays when you're driving around, for the most part, is great.  Beyond stealing cars and completing missions, the combat elements are excellently done--that goes for firearms and ESPECIALLY for melee combat.  Great DLC as well.  Different outfits aren't just for vanity, but add either a challenging element (like added heat from the police) or additional combat options based off of real martial arts schools.... from drunken master, to wing chun, tai chi chuan, mui tai, mma, etc....  There are some classy and fun automobiles and the races range from easy to very challenging difficulty.  The side activities can be as fun as the main story.  You can learn how to swear in Chinese as well.The only thing that could make this game better is actual nudity for all the hot chix you can date--and even Wei Chen... he's got a hot bod too.  Anyone make those mods yet?  If so, hit me up!  Ha.....			",246,50,0,74,29,1,35

												Open world action-adventure game , similar to the GTA series . It's heavy storyline based and has multiple choice scenarios , even with these game mechanics it still feels very linear and very obvious with where the story is heading. It has extra missions/side quest to finish once the main storyline is complete and of course the open world aspect. Overall i would rather play a game from the GTA series over this and probably wont be replaying any part of this game again . ",181,36,5,18,8,2,12

												Sleeping Dogs, i.e. ""True Crime Hong Kong"", is a third-person GTA style free-roamer set in Hong Kong. You play an undercover cop infiltrating the triad known as Song On Yee, and you will swear blood oaths with various triad members, as you understand they are just people like you, yet you will need to bring them to justic at some point. As the story progresses, you will do whatever needs to be done to stay undercover, even if it means eliminating witnessses, kill a few innocents, all for the greater good, perhaps. As the dividing line between good and evil blur, you will find out perhaps not all is as simple as you thought things to be. The various areas of Hong Kong have been simplified but the flavor had been retained. It is big enough to hold races, and various races are already available in the game (with more available via DLC). There are dozens of different vehicles in various classes, plus motorcycles, and if you don't want to run around all day taxis are always avaialble. And there are always tons of things to do (until you manage to do all of them). There are food stands that gives you a boost in various areas, clothing stores to buy outfits (some gives you bonus), car shops to ""buy"" cars, as well as missions such as clean up a gang near a certain hotspot by beating them up, hack the camera nearby, then call in the cops when a mastermind come along. There are also special crime solving missions that have you chase down leads or car stealing missions where the ""dealer"" want a particular model of car ""obtained"". Add that to ""collectibles"" (found all around town, several different types), and over a dozen DLCs that adds more outfits, more missions, more weapons, and more vehicles, and you have a total experience. The game doesn't skimp on combat either. Most combat is melee involving various forms of kung fu, and you will either fight barehand or with weapon (from cleaver to knife, tire iron to lead pipe) There are a few improvised weapon as well (ever tried... fish?)  There are guns avaiable for certain missions, but they are NOT that popular. in HK. You will learn more moves as you go along. All in all, Sleeping Dogs is GTA in Hong Kong with a TON of options, and it will take you dozens of hours to complete, and you can even challenge other players on the Rockstar ""social"" web to establish records and such. And the makers are still pumping out the occasional DLC. Just buy them while they're on sale, and enjoy them.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

The driving feels great fast pased, only driving a bike and crashing with it is a bit too unrealistic and arcady, but overall a great action game and very enjoyable. Well worth the price.

												All I have to say isThis game has surprised me as I am not that much into the GTA/SR games. Ok they are fun for a while but the story does not engage (IMO). Sleeping Dogs has an interesting hand to hand style combat system that at first I did not like, but you learn and improve your skill as you go (which grew on me) and became fun. The story and feel of the game is what keeps me engaged, I want to see how it plays out being an undercover cop in the capacity of infiltrating the Triads.

												I didn't think I would like sleeping dogs that much, because I'm not really into the martial arts   fighting, but when it was in sale I gave it a go, and surprisingly the fighting is alot of fun, challenging at times but very enjoyable. The driving feels great fast pased, only driving a bike and crashing with it is a bit too unrealistic and arcady, but overall a great action game and very enjoyable. Well worth the price.

												First off this game was amazing. The storyline, engine and combat was excellent. I loved the storyline and how they developed it, I honestly thought it was better than any Grand Theft Auto in my opinion. The combat engine is great and I found myself just finding and beating thugs. I recommend this game to anyone that is a sandbox, action and adventure game lover.			",62,9,3,10,4,0,1

												Probably first sandbox game that I cared to beat. Mainly because it really felt story-driven and side missions don't have that ""annoying"" vibe. The combat system is similiar to Arkham's just less complex and it get's kinda repetitive but it's still more fun than running like crazy with rocket launcher and gatling gun in your pocket (if you're that kinda gamer). Speaking of guns shooting is rather John Woo like. If Sleeping Dogs was spicy sauce it would be my top 5 spicy sauce.			",157,42,1,15,6,0,15

												All I have to say isThis game has surprised me as I am not that much into the GTA/SR games. Ok they are fun for a while but the story does not engage (IMO). Sleeping Dogs has an interesting hand to hand style combat system that at first I did not like, but you learn and improve your skill as you go (which grew on me) and became fun. The story and feel of the game is what keeps me engaged, I want to see how it plays out being an undercover cop in the capacity of infiltrating the Triads. So I recommend this game, especially if you found the GTA/SR storylines not to your liking, perhaps you will be surprised as much as I was by Sleeping Dogs.Yes I do Recommend this game.""Why don't you have a pork bun in your hand""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome! I haven't been bored in this game all that time i spent there. Let's go to Pros 'n' Cons, shall we?Pros-Very detailed fights. You want to punch the hell outta enemies? Sure, you can fight with your bare hands or with various melees. You like gun blazin' more? Sure, grab  a gun from a cop car or buy the DLC that gives you an assault rifle in your apartment. You like to shoot people from a badass car with awesome guns on it? Buy Fury Wheels.-Characters. I really felt for each one of them, like they were alive. I'm not giving much description here, bevlcause I don't want to spoil anything-A crap load of clothes. Some of them give you money economy (Less money to pay) bonuses or fighting bonuses, some of them referred to Valve games. I don't really know, if you get them just for free, or you have to get the games that the clothes are referring to.A lot of cars. From typical cars to supercars, or a supercar with miniguns in Fury Wheels. Every car is unique - the look and the characteristics. -The unique moving car hijacking system. Yes, you heard that right - you can hijack any car, while it's on the move.-Characters upgrades - both as triads and the police.-Fight clubs. Easy money + kick♥♥♥♥♥anytime.-Cheap DLCsCons-Missions. While I liked the story, it is pretty short. There's not that much story missions tbh.Awesome game, 9/10 - go play it, no matter - cracked game or the license, just play it. It's worth it.I'm awaiting you in Valhalla!			",79,3,0,3,6,0,1

All at once! The game supports it! Why did I? Well, the fighting and driving was all super awesome using the controller, so fluid, and really kikarse. However trying to shoot a random gun with a controller is for noobs. So I grab my mouse and headshot every enemy in sight, then get back into the arskikin melee.Excelent game. 100% Achieveable too!

												Open world action-adventure game , similar to the GTA series . It's heavy storyline based and has multiple choice scenarios , even with these game mechanics it still feels very linear and very obvious with where the story is heading. It has extra missions/side quest to finish once the main storyline is complete and of course the open world aspect. Overall i would rather play a game from the GTA series over this and probably wont be replaying any part of this game again . ",181,36,5,18,8,2,12

												I think Sleeping Dogs is a really fun game.  The story is fast-paced, intense, and intriguing.  The graphics are wonderful, the atmosphere wonderful with some humor thrown in.  The music that plays when you're driving around, for the most part, is great.  Beyond stealing cars and completing missions, the combat elements are excellently done--that goes for firearms and ESPECIALLY for melee combat.  Great DLC as well.  Different outfits aren't just for vanity, but add either a challenging element (like added heat from the police) or additional combat options based off of real martial arts schools.... from drunken master, to wing chun, tai chi chuan, mui tai, mma, etc....  There are some classy and fun automobiles and the races range from easy to very challenging difficulty.  The side activities can be as fun as the main story.  You can learn how to swear in Chinese as well.The only thing that could make this game better is actual nudity for all the hot chix you can date--and even Wei Chen... he's got a hot bod too.  Anyone make those mods yet?  If so, hit me up!  Ha.....			",246,50,0,74,29,1,35

												Sleeping Dogs, i.e. ""True Crime Hong Kong"", is a third-person GTA style free-roamer set in Hong Kong. You play an undercover cop infiltrating the triad known as Song On Yee, and you will swear blood oaths with various triad members, as you understand they are just people like you, yet you will need to bring them to justic at some point. As the story progresses, you will do whatever needs to be done to stay undercover, even if it means eliminating witnessses, kill a few innocents, all for the greater good, perhaps. As the dividing line between good and evil blur, you will find out perhaps not all is as simple as you thought things to be. The various areas of Hong Kong have been simplified but the flavor had been retained. It is big enough to hold races, and various races are already available in the game (with more available via DLC). There are dozens of different vehicles in various classes, plus motorcycles, and if you don't want to run around all day taxis are always avaialble. And there are always tons of things to do (until you manage to do all of them). There are food stands that gives you a boost in various areas, clothing stores to buy outfits (some gives you bonus), car shops to ""buy"" cars, as well as missions such as clean up a gang near a certain hotspot by beating them up, hack the camera nearby, then call in the cops when a mastermind come along. There are also special crime solving missions that have you chase down leads or car stealing missions where the ""dealer"" want a particular model of car ""obtained"". Add that to ""collectibles"" (found all around town, several different types), and over a dozen DLCs that adds more outfits, more missions, more weapons, and more vehicles, and you have a total experience. The game doesn't skimp on combat either. Most combat is melee involving various forms of kung fu, and you will either fight barehand or with weapon (from cleaver to knife, tire iron to lead pipe) There are a few improvised weapon as well (ever tried... fish?)  There are guns avaiable for certain missions, but they are NOT that popular. in HK. You will learn more moves as you go along. All in all, Sleeping Dogs is GTA in Hong Kong with a TON of options, and it will take you dozens of hours to complete, and you can even challenge other players on the Rockstar ""social"" web to establish records and such. And the makers are still pumping out the occasional DLC. Just buy them while they're on sale, and enjoy them.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												Having recently played through all the big open world games this has got to be my favourite, it really does draw you in. It does not loose focus like the saints row do(still great games though) and it has hands down the best city in an open world game, it is so alive especially at night. Does a great job of making you feel like you are in hong kong. The story gets better and better as it goes along, it may be padded with alot of side missions but they are fun and fit the story/your character well. The characters in the game are very believable and well written and the over all story/tone of the game is of an adult nature.I would easily rate it above watch dogs and saints row 4(two most recent open world games that take place in cities).This was the original launch version without any of the unbalanced dlc that came later.9/10			",175,13,2,29,14,2,17

												Its a shame this studio shut down. I previously tried this game a while back and just couldnt get into it.  I decided to give it another go and it pulled me in enough to solve it.  After getting the handle on the combat and arcade style driving, I started to enjoy this one.  The story was good, the graphics decent, and the gameplay was fun.  It would have been nice to see a part 2 of this series with some cleaned up graphics to carry on the story.  I found it was lacking some depth in extra missions, e.g. girlfriend missions made you feel like more was going to happen in them and they just sort of ended.  All in all, it was worth the play through and I am glad I didnt shelf this one.  If you can get it for cheap, it's worth a pick up as it is a few years old now.			",263,57,11,36,19,2,32

												A highly underrated game from 2012, that is now being refurbished for 2014 in the Definitive Edition {}^__^}If you don't own it already, grab a this 'version' of the game cheap via third-party (with no DLC's) then activate it on Steam. Once activated, check the Definitive Edition store page, which will now show you a 50% discount, which not only includes a totally revamped game (which was already great), but all the DLC's from the original version and then some for the 2014 release \[]^__^]/***3/3*** - My original thoughts in 2012 still stand and I'm looking forward to completing it fully in the 2014 update []^....^]			",755,249,34,51,72,8,56

												Sleeping Dogs is a triple A storyline with hollywood level voice acting and action, but it's hampered by terrible controls and lousy gameplay. Almost every vehicle drives like a boat and the boats like a fat man on an oiled sled across an ice rink. And that's too bad since so much of the game revolves around driving. Wei Shen doesn't control much better on foot. Outside of the melee combat he controls like a boat as well, clumsily trying to navigate around the numerous obstacles and people in his way. Combined with a poor choice of key mapping, get ready for some very frustrating firefights and chase sequences where you may think you have it in the bag only to be stopped at the very end by an open car door and buggy quick action events.I really want to love this game, in fact, I find the story and atmosphere so engrossing that I'm forcing myself to get past the lousy gameplay for it. Sleeping Dogs would have been an amazing linear action game instead of this open world design which I honestly think was done just to pad out game length. But none of the side quests, collecting, upgrades, money mean anything. There simply isn't anything on which to spend all the money you receive. They tried for GTA and failed. I could best compare it to games like LA Noir.Sleeping Dogs could have been a memorable game, but the compelling story keeps getting interrupted by unnecessary junk and the poorly ported controls. It's worth the experience for the story alone, but I wouldn't pay more than a few bucks for the PC cash-in port. ",141,33,0,24,16,3,30

												Very fond of asia. Very fond of sandbox games. This however feels like one big movie set, as you move through the world you start to see where missions and other events are going to happen. It isnt 100% sandbox as in GTA its just not. What it does do right, the story, the graphics the characters. Even down to the NPC it is well detailed. Love the fact they did a def edt. chuffed even. But what I want is the follow on which is coming out soon. Triad wars I think. It has a strong base to work from here with sleeping dogs.			",79,8,8,7,4,0,5

												Great open world game with a fun combat system. Think 'Batman Arkham' games but set in Hong Kong and mixed with Bruce Lee. Overall the story was entertaining enough to keep you plowing through the till the end. The DLC worth getting is Zodiac Tournament! Skip the Nightmare DLC and the Year of the Snake. Though if you have to get one besides Zodiac then get 'Year of the Snake'. You can skip Nightmare because you essentially are doing the same thing over and over which gets old and boring very quickly.			",307,111,4,58,46,0,57

												Is this game woth it?HECK YES! This game is fantastic and it should be in any sandbox gamer's collection.The story line is absolutely fantastic and although you don't make too many options yourself you become weishen and you get so torn up about who you feel more loyal to, the triads that you only just met but feel like family or the law and the consequences going rogue could have. The story line is one of the best i've seen, better than GTA.The world itself is completely immersive, i've only been to japan so I sort of know what an asian style would be like, but square enix really went the extra mile to make this the real hong kong. You know when you're going through GTA and you feel like you've seen the same shop fifty times before, that's because you have. In this besides the shops and businesses you go into almost every shop seems different, on top of that no area seems replicated, it feels like this is the true sandbox game because it is so bloody diverse, never played another game like it.What lacks in guns is made up in the fantastic combat system. Ever watched a bruce lee movie and been like, oh yeah I'll take up martial arts because it's so cool. This game produces the result you desire in such an easy but satisfactory manner. It's easy to learn, and easy to use and some of the attacks are just brutal. The fact of the matter is if you're quick you can take on a pack of 10+ people no problems, just like bruce lee and jackie chan.The cars, especially the sports cars are awesome to drive, also the street racing (also on bikes) is exilerating and awesome. When you start rolling in the cash you can have anything you want!There's just so much to do, ♥♥♥♥ (roosters) fighting, street racing, gambling, fight clubs, etc. And the huge array of side jobs for randoms that can pay well but also give you the satisfaction for helping people you don't know, pushing up your prestige. I mainly love the ones where you get out to help someone but it's a con and someone tackles you and steals your money. It's so satisfactory to beat the living shizzle out of them when you catch up to them, and maybe grab a few extra dollars of their own money.So yes, this game is worth it, GTA might be the fun shoot em up, but it's a mindless series (referring mainly to GTA 4). This game has the life and diversity of a true masterpiece and it has more ups than downs. It's also received very well by most critics.I also finished the story line however I keep coming back to play the sandbox of the game. The only other game that did that for me was GTA III. Vice, San Andreas and 4 didn't have that, so that's really saying something!			",70,2,0,2,5,0,3

												Sleeping Dogs is a great game that is not without its flaws but has won a place in my heart nonetheless. Once you get past the stunning visuals, you are met with an immersive underworld set in Hong Kong where an undercover officer climbs the ranks of the triads while being forced to consider his own loyalties.Unlike other games in the genre, the combat is primarily focused on the melee aspect. Officer Shen is a very competent martial artist, and learns more moves and improves the ones he knows as the game progresses. The system feels fresh at the game's onset, but by the game's finish, it loses some of its charm. It is very visually pleasing, but from a gameplay point of view, it is very easy to master the moveset and dominate enemies under all circumstances. This does, however, propagate the sensation of being the invincible hero of the traditional asian fighting movies from which Sleeping Dogs no doubt has drawn significant amounts of inspiration.Story-wise, the atmoshpere is great. Being in Hong Kong, people speak both English and Chinese, and you often hear the two intertwined. One of the most unusal parts was, in fact, getting used to driving primarily on the left side of the road. You are met with a good deal of characters, some memorable even after one encounter, but many of them are unfortunately flat. This is due mostly to having too little exposure to each of them, the average being two missions for each character - one where you meet them, and one where you do them a favor of some sort. Most benefitted from interesting missions, but there were a few cases in which I felt I'd wasted my time. This deficit applies primarily to the side missions. It is worth noting that some of the side missions fall into extremes; some were very humorous and/or interesting, and some were excruciatingly boring.Racing constitutes a major side activity, and it is decently implemented for a game that focuses on other aspects. You can purchase cars and use them in races, many of which take you through challenging routes. I often felt myself remembering the feeling I had playing Need For Speed Underground while playing through the races in the game. (It's a good feeling)For the primary missions, the cast is built out of stereotypes, but they play their parts well and the story itself, while having some cliche elements, is pleasurable to go through and does have a few unexpected twists. Since you are a police officer in parallel to being a triad member, this opens up a series of circumstances that were especially pleasing to see playing out. The main character is also very likeable, being a smooth talker when the need arises. There are a few moments that are absolutely impossible, such as surviving a shotgun blast in close range or taking down dozens of triad cars on the street like it's nothing, but those can be forgiven since Sleeping Dogs is an action game.The most irksome parts were getting around and going after collectibles. Getting around was immersive at first - you got to see the nooks and crannies of Hong Kong, and there were plenty of very well-detailed areas to enjoy. However, as you progress later into the game, you find yourself constantly wanting to be on the other side of the map, and with often no taxis in sight, the drive that can take several minutes gets tiring. An especially brutal offender was the naval part: getting on or off boats was extremely tiresome, primarily because of invisible walls that made it very hard to transition between sea and land.The collectibles became annoying to deal with because many of them were placed in impossibly hard to reach positions that took ages to scout out for possible entry points. Also, you are heavily coerced into going after two of the three types of collectibles, as you need them to improve your fighting skills and health pool, both of which can pose a serious problem in the later parts of the game if ignored.Finally, I'd like to mention the game's soundtrack. As is usual with such games, there are a number of radio stations, each catering to a different taste. I found myself enjoying several stations personally, and the commentary and advertisements between tracks were well-done and immersive.This sums up how I feel about the game, having just finished it less than an hour ago. I mention the game's shortcomings a lot because those made the experience less enjoyable, but it was definitely a game I enjoyed overall and would recommend to others. It compensates well for what it lacks through solid mechanics, a virtual Hong Kong teeming with detail and a plot that manages to keep the player engaged from start to finish.

												I was very pleasantly surprised with Sleeping Dogs.  From the screenshots and videos I had previously seen, I expected the game to be a lot like Grand Theft Auto (Which I never really have cared for).  However, The storyline was surprisingly well built.  the game follows Wei Shen as an undercover cop infiltrating the Triads.  It deals with his conflict of wanting to stay in the gang with his new position of power and his close friend vs. his mission as a cop.  The story is intense and emotional and not at all what I expected.			",180,30,3,15,15,3,9

												I purchased this game under the influence of ""dank weed"" thinking it would involve dogs and sleeping. This was not the case. I'd like to say that it was a pleasant surprise to be greeted with a strange Chinese man mercilessly beating someone to death in the opening cut scene.

The story about loyalty and dutyThis game tells you about Wei ""Kick-All-Asses"" Shen. Fomer triad member wich was converted by the police and now working for them to destroy the Triad from the inside. Yes, this is about undecover cop with sense of duty AND loyalty to the Triad.I was expecting some storyline choices and ""take a side"" quest in the end, but that won't happen. This game doesn't give you any choices at all. You just follow the story line.All datings are absolutely boring, most of the side missions are the same and the world itself feel a bit dead and empty. Nothing crazy happens like in GTA or Just Cause.But, I liked it. A lot of Kung Fu moves, finishers, Triad charm and cliches f.e. massacre at wedding/funeral. The plot of the game looks more like movie and voice acting is great. Combat is the same as in Batman (it feels really good).Long story short, if you looking for open world game with good story and Hong Kong involved than this game is for you. Otherwise don't look at it.P.S. DLC's are great though.			",234,28,7,15,9,2,27

												Sleeping Dogs experienced anything but a sleepy development cycle. Originally set to be a title in the True Crime franchise, the project was cancelled by publisher Activision when almost being ready, much to the disappointment of developers United Front Games. However, in stepped Square Enix and with their assistance and a small re-branding, the game was back on track. Despite these dramatic events, players will be happy to know that Sleeping Dogs is a fun and diverse open world experience with tons to do, an engaging and serious story, and a memorable and authentic setting. Small gameplay issues and potential lack of variety aside, this is an enjoyable and respectably lengthy outing that can hold its ground against the leaders of the genre.

												At first glance, this may look like an Asian GTA Ripoff, but there's much more to it than that. It's an admirable open-world third-person action game, but it's a lot more fun than GTA IV (bar not having multiplayer). Sure, there's guns every once in a while, but you will be relying on your hands and feet more often, disarming enemies simply to get back to honorable fighting. It's somewhat similar to the recent Batman games in that regard.I would highly recommend this game if you need a refreshing breath from typical sandbox action games, optimized for PC to look pretty with a reasonably powered hardware setup (and you get a free HD texture pack option through Steam when you buy the game, if you feel the fidelity of the graphics aren't awe-inspiring enough already). Wouldn't recommend getting all of the DLC, though, there's only a select few that add to the game while not making the game too easy. I don't want to spoil anything about the story, but it's certainly kept my attention throughout.I give it 4.5 out of 5 apples.			",572,113,10,45,27,4,37

Gameplay is closer to yakuza or an beat em up than GTA since combat is mostly unarmed.Definitely recommended to anyone that likes beat em ups or kung-fu.Also dat rain !

												Warning: This is NOT a GTA clone, proceed with cautionPros-Deep and emotional story-Relatable Characters-You can choose to go from Cop Missions then to Triad Missions or just roam the streets-The Graphics-Doesn't encourage too much gunning around-Imaginative Executions (Meat hook, Toilet, Aquarium)-Open World-Parkour-Emma Stone is in it-Really good atmosphere-World brought to life through Cantonese dialogue, chinese themes and traditional content-Combat-Voice acting is pretty good-Its set in Hong Kong-The amount of costumes for Wei ShenCons-Graphics look ugly at some parts-Girlfriend parts, seemed unnecessary-Camera can be annoying at timesOverall, this game is good. Deep atmosphere, intriguing story, fun gameplay, what's not to like about it? I have to mention the driving since its been awhile since i've played this game, I honestly can't remember if it had clunky controls or smooth controls. All I can say is that the other parts of the game is amazing alone so its worth picking this game up either on full price or on sale (like a cheapie like me).Final Verdict: 9/10Score: Go get it!

												So far so good with great graphic, and story.  you don't have to be a movie star to do all this this fun action.  Get in the game and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ or get your♥♥♥♥♥kick :D- Most of the action is fun, smooth driving  but you have to watch out for everything  on the street even flowers pots, and side walk  :D - Your car in the race  will always behide any other cars at the start.  racing such because they cheated.  So have fun in deadly racing in HK  city ....Fast and Fearious ....really you need a 10 second car to die in 20 second ...LOL- If you did something wrong and the officer catch you then give you a big fine so do what ever it take to get away.  if the officer about to put you down press 'A' to put him back down then keep running ...The only people can rope you is them. Even you are one of them :D- I will rate the city race 3/5, story is 5/5 and the rest of game is 4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game makes no attempt to hide its influences...  The open-world criminality of GTA.  Batman's 1-vs-many melee combat.  Mirror's Edge style free-running.  Acrobatic hijackings straight out of Just Cause 2.  Cover shooting, a la Gears of War.  Innumerable cop movies and Bruce Lee movies get huge nods.  And it works.Every idea Sleeping Dogs borrows is done less well than in the game or film that inspired it, but its success lies in the blend.  The fistfights are much better than in GTA, you go on kill-crazy rampages undreamed of in Batman, and one of the side missions is basically ""Enter The Dragon"", complete with cheesy '70s film grain effects.  What more could you want?			",114,34,14,9,6,0,4

												Very fun game, nothing too difficult to do, lots of stuff to kill time & do.The story was pretty interesting, an undercover cop posing as a criminal, they tried to do the duality of cop vs criminal and have morality be important, but failed on that.  It's blatantly obvious which side of the law your character is on.  However, it's still fun to watch.  Gameplay is great, controller needed.  Nightmare in North Point  is short, easy, silly but fun and the only DLC I would recommend buying w/this.  Year of the Snake is upcoming w/more achievements so I'll get that.8.5/10			",191,19,8,12,10,1,9

												Sleeping Dogs is probably going to be my favourite game this year. It’s hard to imagine why Activision wanted to scrap this game as it really excels well as a sandbox game and has refined how we see the genre altogether.The story is amazing and can hold its own compared to Mafia 2 / GTA4. The combat is great, as well as movement; it’s very responsive compared to GTA4. Car’s are slightly arcade-ish to handle - but considering you can hijack cars and do slow motion shoot-outs it works out pretty well.Overall Sleeping Dogs is a love letter to Hong Kong cinema; I’ve been mesmerized by its tiny immaculate detail which gives this game so much charisma and charm. Truly one the great gems of this generation.On a last note, the PC version is just amazing, advance PC options and day 1 HD textures really show that United Front is committed to the PC. Listening to Ninja Tune radio while driving a motorbike down a wet and rainy neon lit sky is just pure bliss.			",286,66,13,23,13,3,29

												Sleeping Dogs adds its name to the ever growing list of genuinely good open-world action adventure games. The melee combat focus threw me off at first, but after switching to a gaming controller, the gameplay felt significantly more intuitive over a mouse & keyboard. The intertwined story of undercover cop and bad♥♥♥♥♥Triad Sun On Yee Red Pole is impressively put together. Sleeping Dogs comes off every bit as an AAA title with superb graphics, voice acting, and gameplay. Plus the amazing assortment of radio stations and musical flavors is extraordinary.Even though most of the side missions felt underwhelming, repetitive, and in many cases downright boring, I found myself continuously getting distracted trying to complete them, or stopping to seek out that next health upgrade or lockbox. I realize now it was the reward element that made them so addicting--always granting some new unlock or item reward. The taxi service is a nice feature if you want to get somewhere fast, although the car handling feels very similar to GTA San Andreas which makes driving good fun. Also the DLC adds a good variety of worthwhile content as well.Two thumbs up.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												I want to love Sleeping Dogs more than you can imagine. It’s colorful, spectacularly detailed, controls perfectly, it’s well optimized, the story and missions are compelling and varied, everything about it is fantastic. Sadly I just don’t enjoy brawling. Yes, there is gunplay in Sleeping Dogs (and it’s just as well executed as the rest of the game) but it takes a very definitive back seat to the martial arts combat system.In all my years gaming the only brawling/martial arts combat game I have ever truly sunken into is the Batman franchise. The combat in Sleeping Dogs does not have quite the same fluidity as Batman but it is still very responsive and well done. To be honest, I don’t quite know why it is that Batman is fun to me but the combat in Sleeping Dogs isn’t; I don’t believe that minor difference in fluidity is the defining flaw. So it’s a brawler whose combat I dislike, no recommendation right? Wrong. Despite the backbone of the game being brawling, the game as a whole is an open world GTA style sandbox and there were so many hours of content that I absolutely loved.If you’re not a brawling fan, Sleeping Dogs may not be something you think you would enjoy, but there is a lot there that the trailers and screenshots leave out.

												Do you want to buy a game about criminals, but GTA is too expensive? Buy this instead! Sleeping Dogs has a same concept as GTA. Wei Shen, hongkongnese undercover cop, has to work not only for Police, but even for Triad. My best experience in this game was learning it's basics - For someone, who played GTA or another open-world games with cars, it's hard to get used to drive the cars - steering wheel on the opposite side and opposite traffic lanes... I destroyed many cars before I got used to that. Pros++Good story+Side jobs and police cases+Activities(Karaoke, Races, Fighting...)+Good skill system (Obtaining COP and TRIAD experience)+Combat systemCons--Too short, I expected longer story-Too much pointless DLC's (The Year of the Snake and Nightmare at the North Point were good)			",173,54,4,24,20,3,14

												Sleeping Dogs: Ultimate Edition trailer promises a true Hong Kong action flick experience. Vibrant neon city teeming with life, with exotic locations and busy streets hide one of the most powerful and dangerous criminal organizations in the world: Triads. First Sleeping Dogs is a very difficult mission, Wei Shen, an undercover cop trying to take down the Triads from the inside to the outside part. So starting from Varki mission as Wei Shen, a secret police watching this kameruomis Varki, and then randomly at times and not at once instead of a civilian. I picked up one of the Varkaus machete and kill civilians. At the time, attacked the police. You need to run after his colleague Naz he stops for the kitchen, and did not say anything, what do you have to run to the door, and ran Tuol as you can, because you get caught the police. Everything consists of the Hong Kong mafia. You'll have to prove himself worthy as you fight your way to the top of the organization involved in the brutal criminal activities without blowing your cover.Torn between his loyalty to the badge of honor, and the Criminal Code, you risk everything as the truth, loyalty and justice become permanently blurred lines.

												I spent actual money to buy DLC for this game, that is how much I love it.The story takes place in Hong Kong and it's your undercover cop who infiltrates a triad well known to him, and the love for his friends and his duty will be in conflict throughout the game. What elevates this story from the rest is the excellent voice acting and compelling characters that are both believeable and relateable.The game is an open-world third-person action shooter. The combat is an improved version of the Batman: Arkham games formula, with the introduction of combos, melee weapons (like cleavers, batons and even fish!!), environmental executions and guns that, at first, feel kind of awkward, but I got used to them.There is a lot of side activities in the world to complete: doing favors to increase fame, take part in illegal races, wipe out hidden triad gangs and sing karaoke.The graphics are impressive, and the game really shines at night time. The city does feel alive, even though most of the pedestrians are walking or talking on a phone. The soundtrack is full of both chinese and english songs, with plenty of radio stations to choose from.However, this game is far from perfect: the biggest complaint I have is that, when you have beaten all the story missions and favours and races, there is nothing to do. Trying to get involved in car chases with the police doesn't help since you will have upgrades that reduce heat faster than ever.Overall, it's a fun game to spend time to, with a compelling story and many side activities, even though at the end there is nothing else to do.SCORE: 89/100			",532,126,11,40,24,4,34

But eventually you will get used to it. Its a really fun game with an undercover cop. In the game you get to do lots of mission as well. The fighting!!!! The fighting in that game is really the coolest part about it. Personally I love this game so much. I hope this review helps to buy this game.			",315,36,10,23,21,2,10

												I really enjoyed Sleeping Dogs, I spent a good hundred hours or so on it on my xbox before purchasing it on steam.The BasicsSleeping Dogs is an open world, third person sandbox game, set in Hong Kong. I really liked the setting of the game, as it's something different than the ususal, small things like, driving on the left side of the road made the game a bit more interesting than it would've been, should they have left details like this out. The story revolves around Wei, an undercover cop sent to take down the mafia that operates in Hong Kong.The GameplaySleeping Dogs has amazing fighting mechanics, it mostly revolves around melee combat, and guns are only used when absolutely neccesary. Because of this, Sleeping Dogs stands out from it's rivals, the melee combat is fluent, fun and never gets old. The gun mechanics are good, but nothing special or exceptional, just plain old shooting. The Melle however has a LOT of combos, and that makes for good variation, you can also execute enemies using the enviroment, giving you bonus points while finishing off an enemy in style. Driving mechanics is the only thing I dislike about this game and while you get used to them after an hour or so, they still bug me. The cars handle extremely unrealistic and I would consider that this games major flaw.I do really like how well-optimised the game is for PC, it's an exceptional port with settings like 'world densitiy', which will determine how many pedestrians, cars etc there will be in the world.The GraphicsSleeping Dogs looks good, and the world feels alive and immersive, especially at night. The game's true beauty comes out when you're driving through the city at night, with all the neon lighting and advertising creating a beautiful lit up picture. So yes, this game looks good and I'm sure it'll age well.To Summarize+Great fighting mechanics, very refreshing melee combat.+Good gunplay, though nothing exceptional.+Amazing setting.+Attention to detail.+Graphics are really nice looking.+Great PC-port.-Driving mechanics leave something to be desired.

												Fantastic game. Its an open world game that reminds me of a cross between the Batman Arkham games and Grand Theft Auto. You play as an undercover cop trying to break up gang activity in Hong Kong. The combat is smooth and its well optimized for PC. I highly recommend this game. Even at full price its worth it.

												The game itself is great, just DO NOT buy the ""Low Violence Version""! It's full of bugs, performance problems and random CTDs because Square Enix refuses to update/patch it.Additionally - for anyone who cares - you can't get all of the Steam-Achievements, because some of them belong to DLCs that are not available in geolocked countries and/or not compatible with the ""Low Violence Version"".Uncut Version - 8 / 10Low Violence Version - 4 / 10If you have the option ask someone from a NOT geolocked country to gift you the Uncut Version.

												Sleeping dogs is an average open-world sandbox game, similar to the GTA series. However, gun fights are rare in sleeping dogs and combat comes mainly in the form is mainly fist-fights with weapons, multiple hit combos and quick-time event blocks, which I personally find more satisfying. However, the world isn't as big as modern GTA games and there isn't much to explore or do after the main missions.			",51,5,2,5,6,0,1

												Decent game in the GTA genre, although the cars are nigh indestructible here (which admittedly can be a lot of fun). The story is a little disjointed in parts but overall very good. The game has more melee/kung fu fighting than gunfighting, although there is a fair share of the latter. You play an undercover cop infiltrating one of the strongest Triads in Hong Kong, and the story is about family, loyalty, betrayal, and where your own loyalties lie.I would rate this game a 6/10; there are a few things that keep it from really shining. As I mentioned above, the story seems disjointed in parts. You will meet a girl, call her once to hang out, and then she is never seen or heard from again. This happens on multiple occasions, with no explanation as to what happened to her. A few of the main storyline missions also thrust you into situations that don't make sense or haven't been properly explained, as well. It's not enough to ruin the game, and you figure out what's going on quickly enough, but it just feels unpolished, almost like there were supposed to be missions in between or a linking storyline to tie it together better, that got left out for some reason.My two biggest gripes about the game are that your character Wei Shen, is basically Superman, able to take on up to 12+ guys at once with his Kung Fu that would put Bruce Lee to shame. He is also able to absorb an apparently infinite amount of bullets, as long as you let him rest for a few seconds in between getting shot. The second big complaint is the wardrobe/clothing system in the game. Different outfits give different bonuses, like extra melee damage or increased xp gain. You can mix and match different things like shirts, pants, shoes, sunglasses, and other accessories to gain various set bonuses. The problem is that it is extremely tedious trying to put together a set with a good bonus that also looks halfway decent. I spent most of the game wearing a pair of sunglasses that made me look like I belonged on the set of Jersey Shore, which made cutscenes where I'm talking to the Triad leader about loyalty and other Deep Sh*t™ just laughable. It didn't ruin my enjoyment of the game, it just made certain parts seem pretty silly. Imagine taking down a group of 8 or 10 rival Triads while wearing a straw sombrero, purple shoes, a giant neon green watch, idiotic sunglasses (at night), beach shorts, and a puffy jacket.Overall, I would recommend this game if you like the GTA genre, but I got this game on sale ($4) and got about 24 hours of enjoyment out of it. A very good value if you ask me; YMMV.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is not perfect and there are some minor issues that I have with it, however the story is fantastic and the purchase of the two main DLCs: Year of the Snake and Nightmare in North Point expand the story further making the game highly enjoyable. One thing to note is that the game is a wide open world and the combat system, though slightly repetative is pretty good. I hope others do purchase the main game at least because it does provide you a few days of gaming if you wish to finish the in game events and related achievments.			",315,50,16,29,18,4,9

												Very nice open world game and pretty polished. Some aspects do come off as gimmicky, like the face-meter. When you complete a couple of side-missions and you're wearing stuff that's giving you a bonus face percentage when completing these missions, your face-meter is already at max halfway through the game. Graphics are very nice, espcecially when it's raining (and it's raining a lot!) the roadreflections look really cool.Story is okay, but I tended to get out of the flow when doing all the other stuff that there's to do. Side-missions can get pretty repetitive or tedious even, but I still got the urge to do every one of them, because there actually is a lot of gameplay on offer. For instance hi-jacking moneytrucks was a really cool thing to do (actually hi-jacking any car was), where the races actually could be kind of frustrating and hacking camera's was just addicting (and there's a lot more to do!).  Combat in this game felt reminiscent of that in the Batman games although not done as well imo. This was mainly because of the not-too-good camera-work. Being able to make use of the environment while in combat made up for this. It's really satisfactory slamming some bad-guy's head into a car door while seeing the glass shatter all around.All in all if you like open-world games like GTA this is definitely for you. For 4 bucks or euro's you can't go wrong. It's sure to keep you interested for a couple of dozens of hours.			",59,8,1,3,5,0,6

Posted: May 18, 2014
												So i'm sitting here with my plate of noodles, thinking what to say about Sleeping Dogs. Since it is one of those games that i'm two minds about. On one hand, it delivers a well crafted and realised Hong Kong cop-drama, but on the other hand, it feels like a very lackluster open-world game. A bit of history, this game started off as a continuation to the True Crime series, but for reasons i cannot remember at this point, the development stopped. And  i think the game was saved in part by that decision. True Crime was not considered to be the best of series and if Sleeping Dogs (At time of original development True Crime:Hong Kong) it would have just fallen into obscurity with the rest, only to be remembered by the fans of the series. But does Sleeping Dogs survive on its own Or does it deserve the long sleep ?STORY:The story follows Wei Shen, an undercover cop sent to covertly infiltrate one of Hong Kongs famous triad gangs. And since i try my best to avoid spoilers, i will only summarize. That the story is heavily influensed by many of the famous Hong Kong cop-movies. And it is interesting enough to warrant playing through more than once.GAMEPLAY:Unfortunately for the game, the open-world nature really does it no favours. On the other hand it offers a very lively representation of Hong Kong and on the other it feels useless. There really is not enough content to warrant an open world, no random flippentry to perform besides some of the social challenges things and annoying the police. And that is about it. One oddity, that i believe also alienated some of the playerbase. Is the scarce amount of firearms, the game is mostly centered around melee combat and the system they used is so similiar to the Arkham-series that it feels almost like it was ripped off. But what there is, is functional enough. There are enviromental attacks that are flashy but a tad lengthy and a few other minor issues with the combat system.The game has a great number of glitches and bugs, some are funny and some are absolutely infuriating. Most of theese bugs are centered around the freerunning system, i feel like it should have been polished a little more for the pc-version. Since  the game was designed for consoles, there are also some annoying problems with the camera. Overall, the porting could have been done much better.SOUND DESIGN:Like GTA, theres a decent amount of copyrighted music. Nothing to be annoyed about, but nothing to remember neither. The only funny thing is, that there is a karaoke-bar, with actual karaoke. A pattern minigame, but worth it to listen Weis voice actors vo over the song. Yes, they went there...CONCLUSION:Considering the problems that Sleeping Dogs, could i recoommend it ? Short answer, YES. Long answer, the game feels padded out lengthwise, several minor problems deteriorate the gameplay experince, optional activities feel like diversions, experience leveling is questionable and the rewards they give are minor to say the least. The story is the only thing that is supposed to carry the game, but does it ? Not really...I would give this game a C+. It feels a little low, but as i have tried to explain, the only thing worth something in this game is the story it tells and really nothing else. What there is on the activities side, is forgettable and getting a 100% feels like a wasted effort.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Reader,Sleeping Dogs is a spectactular game. With a lovely story where everyone is happy and they gets what they want, it makes for a truely realistic experience of what it is like being a man living in Hong Kong. In Sleeping Dogs, there is no violence or drama, but it makes up for that with lots of heartfelt, family-friendly humor. I have personally put almost 24 hours worth of my time into this game, and I do intend to put more. So, if you do get bored with your mindless slaughter of innocent NPC's, purchase and enjoy Sleeping Dogs today.Love,Fossor_			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I LOVE sleeping dogs so much - I go punch a bunch of civilians until a cop shows up, grab his gun, jump in a bus, and get the whole police department to follow me in a parade down the highway. Just getting my wanted level to five and then getting away is enough of a game in and of itself. the gameplay feels much more refined then GTA 4, and the driving is top notch.I would suggest getting at least one fast DLC car from the start - just so you can cruse down the highway when you don't feel like doing missions.

												I fell in love with this game the first time I played it. I'd been on the fence regarding buying it since I'd heard a few detractors saying it wasn't as good as GTA. I love the GTA series, but this tops them. Why? Because not only the story is good, but also the fighting mechanic - GTA was never good at fighting, it was all about driving and shooting. Sleeping Dogs brings in the Arkham series' style of freeflow fighting (though not as good as the Arkham games, it's not far off) as well as cool things like being able to jump from one car to another to hijack vehicles, take hostages, have bullet time vault shootings and much more.The game is 2 years old but still looks as good, if not better (at times), than Watch Dogs. It runs really well, too. I was able to run it at ultra settings the day it came out, even with the hi-res PC-only texture pack that was released. Nowadays, I can run it at 2880x1620 (and would expect to run it at 4k, if my monitor supported it).If you've been disappointed by Watch Dogs, then give this a try - I personally find it's more fun than Watch Dogs, allows you to interact with the other people in the environment more and has a great fighting system. It doesn't have all the hacking stuff, and is more action-orientated than stealth based, but that's not always a bad thing in the open world genre.			",716,192,26,80,137,14,102

												Sleeping Dogs is an amazing game. just the plot the character and city it all ties up to make something new. you play as wei chein a under cover cop thats trying to find out what the sun on yee is planning the gameplay is incredible with moves that would impress bruce lee himself!the only downside is the shooting well uhh not much flexibility there i mean really you could'nt even add a place were chien can put his gun i mean sometimes you have to beat up a guy just to get his gun while the enemies shooting you so to sum it all up the shooting pretty stupid. sleeping dogs a fantastic game  ",121,31,1,18,7,2,10

												Sleeping dogs may not be the most impressive open world game ever made. Comparing it to the slapstick humour of saints row 3 and 4 or the gritty GTA 4 but what this game does is nothing short of amazing. The story is well written and is full of twists and curveballs. The ending is satisfying and Wei Shen is a man with his own problems which is told beautifully through is interactions with other characters and himself. Though some reviewers may not like this game for what it is not but for what it is simply put, it is “Enter the Dragon The videogame”. A true Square Enix master piece and throughly enjoyed it. 4.5/5 ",203,37,3,20,13,4,41

												A great sandbox experience. The hand to hand combat is some of the best I've ever played, the side quests and missions are suprisingly fun and the story is a good action movie type storyline, which works suprisingly well in the game. The problems start to flare up when you get to the gunplay sequences, the guns are in very short variety, are straight upgrades from one to the next and handle pretty poorly. The unlocking system in this game, also known as the Face system is a bit wonky too. The game blatantly blocks out different buyable things, such as cars and clothing, for no good reason. Its a good game but has its very obvious flaws. 7/10, if you see it on sale (as it is as I right this review) grab it, but the 20$ pricetag is a bit much for it.			",178,25,1,22,18,0,34

												Although similar missions makes the game a little bit boring after a while and it has many bugs, it is not a bad idea to spend some time to play Sleeping Dogs. It could be a better action game with this scenario but it is still okay as how it is. I suggest you not to deal with too many favors and mini missions. Unfortunately, I did and that is what makes the game a little bit boring. Follow the main missions and the cop cases. Trust me, it is a better game if you just follow the main steps. Last of all they must pay some for the licenses of the vehicles. In this way, it looks cheap.In addition: I don't think it is a good idea to compare Sleeping Dogs with GTA but if I have to, I would say that Sleeping Dogs has a better atmosphere and a much more organized and interesting scenario. In contrast, It would be unfair to compare their gameplay. Sleeping Dogs can't reach the GTA's standards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I started playing Sleeping Dogs, I haven't had much expectations. ""Just another GTA-like, open world game"". Well, I was wrong. The game has strong characters, good story (for an open world game, at least), really satisfying combat system: melee as well as shooting. Though the best thing about it was, in my opinion, the world. Honk Kong looks and feels alive. Unlike many other games in this genre, you can really feel as if you were in the city. Obviously, it is not perfect, but the feel of the city is really good.Game has it's problems, but I never econquered any game-breaking bugs. PC port is decent, but it has a hard time with using the cursor in game menus. Other than that, nothing of importance found.I recommend the game to anyone who wants to have a little fun. Especially if you're bored with games which take place in the US. This game offers something different, but in a way that guarantees that you won't get TOO much of the Honk Kong culture.

												So, I have just beaten Sleeping Dogs. I must say, this game is probably the best game to have come out in 2012. You play as Wei Shen, an undercover Hong Kong police officer who has the task of infiltrating the biggest triad in Hong Kong: Sun On Yee. The story is set up beautifully, almost like a chess board. You start out working with the other pawns in the triad and as the story evolves, you meet all the other pieces of the board. And like in the game of chess, pieces are moved and taken away as the game progresses. The charecters are also very black and white like chess pieces in which you know who your enemies are, and you know who your friends are. There's no reach-arounds or deception, which is a plus in this sort of game. Gameplay is very much like a stew. There are pieces of other games that are brewed together and made into something good and unique. You have the freerunning of Assassin's Creed, the combat is very much like the Batman series of games, the HUD layout is almost exactly like Grand Theft Auto IV's. The driving is actually kinda bad in the game because all the cars and motorcycles go incredibly fast for the tight confines of Hong Kong's streets. But when you ride shotgun in a car and do the shooting while an AI drives, it is amazing.The content in this game is nearly unending. You have a ton of side missions, street races, drug busts, dates, clothing and cars to buy, cop missions, and even more if you get some of the DLC. The main missions are quite well done, though there doesn't seem to be much creativity put into them. But that's okay, because the game is just so fun you don't really notice it until you look back on it. The charecters are very good in the game. With your own charecter, you get to see the battle he has with himself, the police, and the triads. You see him start to blur the lines and get his hands dirty while trying to keep on the straight and narrow. You get attached easily and heartbroken when bad things happen. I think the charecters are the best aspect they did of this game. I would say my final rating will have to be a 10/10. There is almost nothing wrong in this game. Highly recommended.

												I really like this game, there are only a few mistakes I'd like to mention here. I have got the german version and its complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ Cutscenes are cut to a non-violent cinema that even children could watch. You can't carry guns in or out of missions. And the point that hurts me the most are the executions with your enviorement. If in the international version there are 10 executions in one place, in the cut are about 2. But enough of hating, its still fun to play. The story is great, and the characters interesting. There is a skill tree, but it doesn't matter what you choose because you get can get everything in the Storyline missions, which is long and full of tension and action. It may get a bit repetetive after a while but there is an open world so you can do what ever you like to.All in all its  a good game, but get it uncut or you'll be left with only half of the game. If it's under 15€, buy ut and you're perfectly okay.			",21,2,0,0,1,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs provides the player to be a part of undercover cop with strong and engrossing narrative set in open-world. Once again, it is always compared to GTA-like games, but Sleeping Dogs has proved itself to be high potential sandbox. The production is easily noticeable; plot, voice acting, and environment are simply amazing. The cities are highly detailed and full of NPCs walking around and perform their activities based on situation. If Kane and Lynch: Dog Days takes player to the darkest side of China, then Sleeping Dogs will bring player to richly-detailed and diverse environment in Hong Kong from the old slums and night market to the business districts.The gameplay is another strong point. The main missions are pretty diverse and well connect to the storyline. The game offers you many types of mini-game like plant a bug, picklock, cracking safe which give you feeling of being undercover cop. Martial arts is easy to learn and achieve as you proceed through the game, you will unlock more fighting style to beat different types of enemy; knock, stun, combo, and environment kills give a very satisfied outcome and well entertained. The gunplay has simple mechanics; fire behind cover or slide on object to activate slow-motion (like a John Woo’s films). Both running chase scenes and driving are well-made for badass feeling like shooting tires to take down enemy vehicles or hijack vehicle and continue your road carnage. Moreover, the ramming mechanics during driving is simply useful as you can use it to lose the cops or even boost your speed in race. Sleeping Dogs also rewards player in every mission and collectables which keep on player engagement and provide meaningful collectable. However, the side mission is quite less creative and combat is quite sluggish. Still, there is a lot of detail and things to do even you complete the game.Lastly, the radio music is memorable with old Chinese song and some are from famous singer. The mixture of voice between pure Cantonese and English dub create the feel of player’s presence and preserve what Hong Kong should be.Sleeping Dogs is unique and diverse as I said. The developers care in most details and know what keep on player engagement. It gives me very great experience to be part of Hong Kong and triad life. I never regret for every buck I spend on this game. Like it or not, you have to taste once.			",218,56,5,10,3,2,3

												if you're looking for something between the all to serious GTA 4 series, the waay to wacky Saint rows series, and still want a good story and just balls on the floor action of a Asian action flick of the 90's. my friends~! look no further then Sleeping dogs. this game is a great game and was one of my picks for game of the year, last year aside from other sleeper hits.

												Ahh sleeping dogs how i love this game. Since i love it so much i am gonna get the stuff i hate about it over and done with first of all. Im gonna cut the bull and get right into it.First of all if it wasnt free on xbox live gold i wouldn't have played it beacuse it didn't work on my pc, Wich apparently i wasn't the only one who had that problem.The second thing i hated was that when you finished the game the open world offerd nothing extra to do but a few side missions wich lacked creativity. And also the driving was a bit hard to control, Not being racist here... ok i am about to be, But why would they make a game were you are asian and you can't drive properly, please dont hate me.The combat is my first thing i wanna talk about, It controls smoother than an asian kid doing homework (Wich if you didn't know is really smooth like spreading peanutbutter on your genatles). Take the batman combat and you have sleeping dogs combat. Amazing, Quick, Intense, Fun and Fluent combat really makes a game like sleeping dogs.Next thing i want to talk about is the parkour. Its all right not like assins creed parkour but still can be fairly fun. One of my favourite features with it was when you jump from a building to a building and it goes in slow motion. Another neat thing to it is having to run and tap a to jump over things, It makes it feel more fluent.Now on to the open world. As i said before there isn't much to do in it but stare at it like that old creepy guy does down the road at you. But like the old creepy guy staring at you it's enjoyable for someone. It really depends if you like to stop sometimes and enjoy the scene. The hong kong setting was really special to me.Now my last point of the review and by fair the best point... The story line. The story line is...is....♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING I DON'T CARE IF STEAM DOSN'T LET ME SWEAR IT IS ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING! You play as an under cover cop and you have to infiltrate a triad (A chinese gang). At the begining you don't feel sorry for anyone in the gang beacuse they're crimanals. But the further the story goes the more and more you get attatched to everyone, And the more you get attatched to everyone the more the game reminds you that you are a under cover cop. You know you shouldn't feel for them but you do and it is so amazing!I rate this game....a 8.5 out of 10 For consoleFor pc i would give it a 0 beacuse it dosn't work for alot of people.

												This is my favourite game of all time. The graphics are beautiful, not texture wise, but how densely populated the city is, it's gorgeous. The models of the main game characters are just wonderful. The combat feels nice and smooth, and it feels great to fight. Gunplay is fun, and there is not to much of it, which I really like. The story is brilliant, it's one of my favourite game stories ever. The driving feels nice and acarde like, just how it should be. I strongly recommend this game who likes to play amazing games.

												Easily my favorite sandbox action game. If you don't know Mandarin and Cantonese, and have never been to Hong Kong you might miss out on just a little bit of the ironic humor and charm of the game. Moments of dialogue like, ""Wei Shen (sic Xian), you are a dangerous man."" Funny because the protagonist's name is a Mandarin homophone for ""dangerous."" There is even a radio station for canto-rap/hip-hop. But there is more than enough to enjoy if you are a fan of Hong Kong cinema, kung fu, and over-the-top sandbox action games. Over-the-top because there are some outrageous enviornmental kills, enemy vehicles explode when you shoot out their tires at high speeds, vaulting from cover gives you bullet time that will keep going as long as you can keep stringing together headshots. All of which add to the feeling that you are starring in the John Woo version Infernal Affairs. While it may be hard to believe that an undercover cop could avoid more serious consequences for causing so much mayhem, the story is still enjoyable and is great at delivering on the expectations it creates. The weakest part of the game for the PC version is the driving, turning up the motion blur helps but driving still has less feedback than it did on my console.			",20,9,0,21,0,0,22

												Sleeping dogs may not be the most impressive open world game ever made. Comparing it to the slapstick humour of saints row 3 and 4 or the gritty GTA 4 but what this game does is nothing short of amazing. The story is well written and is full of twists and curveballs. The ending is satisfying and Wei Shen is a man with his own problems which is told beautifully through is interactions with other characters and himself. Though some reviewers may not like this game for what it is not but for what it is simply put, it is “Enter the Dragon The videogame”. A true Square Enix master piece and throughly enjoyed it. 4.5/5 ",203,37,3,20,13,4,41

												A great action game, I really enjoyed the story and the environment full of ""asian flavour"" it really invites you exploring Hong Kong, the city graphics are beautifully detailed and the game's music sets up the right mood with an eclectic soundtrack.The combat system is fun and diverse, since you can one on one using kung fu style techniques and later on you can start firing weapons, shooting from distance with a nice cover and slow motion modes.If you enjoy GTA type of game, sleeping dogs won't disapoint you.

												Bought this game for $4.99 and I'm glad I did. You are a undercover cop, and your job is to get trusted by a gang to take them down. Sleeping Dogs has a great story with a few suprising twists and turns, even without the story the gameplay is very fun. Hand to hand combat is very smooth along with good gunplay. You can compare the gameplay of this game to Grand Theft Auto and I actually enjoy this game more. It runs smooth at decent settings with my GTX 660. I would give it a solid 9/10.

												I didn't know much about Sleeping Dogs when I bought it and this game suprised me. It's awesome!  It's not a GTA killer ,but it's well made. In the unofficial sequel of ""True Crime"" you play the Undercover Cop  Wei Shen , who enters the world of the Triads. The graphic in this game is nicely done ( you need to download the free HD DLC to enjoy the game with full graphic), the gameplay and the action scenes are awesome (John Woo would be proud), you can customize your charakter and the story is well made.Sadly , this game doesn't have any replay value (for my opinion). I mean you could find all the secrets but that's boring for me and the DLCs are way too expensive.It's a well made game and I would recommend it everyone, who enjoyed GTA and the old True Crime games. 9/10 P.S.: Best feature in the game

												I love this game a Hong Kong Based Open World adventure like GTA. But your a policeman undercover so a little less killing a lot of kung fu and training. A ton of other cool missions and a bunch of hidden lockboxes,statues and prayer zones the more you find the more your health score maxes out.This game reminds me of the original Shenmue series that was on Sega Dreamcast many years ago and the newer Yakuza franchise that was out on PS3. I have played for 20 hours around and have about 20 percent done. But if your friends have the game see how long you can drive at full speed and not hit anything to break your friends record or knock down parking meters and collect money and see if you can beat your friend at that. Many things going on in the game. You actually level up as police and as the gang triad which both give you different new abilities. I would give the game 5 out of 5 stars if their was a rating system!			",213,117,16,9,11,5,18

												This game has one of the best stories I have ever experienced. Wei Shen is a great character that I really connected to, and I really started to like Jackie Ma too, not to mention Winston, Peggy, and Uncle Po. You never really know what to expect next in the plot- one second you'll be attending a funeral, the next a rival gang brings the police to arrest you. The ending was also extremely heartbreaking. The slow motion shooting in cars is very cool, the""parkour"" flawless, the driving fun. There are a plethora of missions and side missions, which you can replay, as well as unlockables spread throughout Hong Kong. Fast traveling is immersive (you have to hire a taxi) and food, drinks, and massages have different game-changing effects on you. The graphics are also very good. The neon lights in the commercial areas are beautiful, and areas such as the Night Market, Victoria Peak, and the ramps at the docks made me keep coming back. I wouldn't like to think about this game not coming out. It's one of my favorite games of all time.			",53,10,0,6,8,0,3

												When it comes to fights in games (especially in a way of martial arts), I am always very excited. And this game has it both: Martial Arts and Weapons. Although there are some sequences in the story that you cant get through without weapons, a lot of missions , especially these at the start, will get you deeper in the system of martial arts in the game. You will hardly ever have a problem to fight your enemies in a melee fight as the combos have been developed very accurate and simple for you. You dont have to push 20 similar buttons on the keyboard to do the roundhouse kick, you simply klick on your mouse 5 times. In some cases the time you get for hitting a counter may be a bit slow, but in general the fighting system is very pleseant for me. With a lot more combos you can learn with ingame progress, the amount of them seems almost endless.The story of Sleeping dogs will let you take a closer look into the Hongkongs Underground Organization Sun-On Yee.  Including Undercover Cops , a shootout on a wedding , a funeral and many more things, the story is both touching and exciting. Even after finishing the storyline there are a lot more things you can do in Hongkong. Upgrading your wardrobe, filling your garage with more vehicles and collect pickups for new combos are just a few of them.As the graphics of the game didnt have any downs for me (Note: For me graphics are not that important), I can only recommend the game to you.Have Fun! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very enjoyable open world action game. One of my absolute favourite mechanics of the game is the easy interchangeability between keyboard+mouse and gamepad which is damn handy for a person who has not played shooters on console all that much. I used my X360 gamepad for the driving and martial arts parts of the game and switched to keyboard+mouse for the shooting parts. It is also surprising how easy one gets used to driving on the left (wrong side!) of the road.The story itself isn't spectacular, but is it entertaining and I'd personally say does an admirable job at telling an undercover police story. The voice acting is also very good and surprisingly there are a good number of famous people lending their voice.This game though has VERY many DLCs. Some of them though are free, but others are mainly cosmetic where they add some outfits or vehicles or weapons. There are also others like the Police Protection Pack which just added a single mission and that was it, although later made the stuff in that mission available in the rest of the game. You also have two content DLC which add a few hours of gameplay with missions tied to Halloween (Nightmare at North Point) and Chinese New Year (Year of the Snake). There is also the SWAT pack, where you do random police missions disguised as a SWAT member. These DLC are entirely optional so might be worth picking up at a discount.			",139,17,3,23,16,3,52

												Yes, really recommended. I think it has a lot that GTA didn't achieve. It's on Hong Kong, it's open world, the fight system is not Yakuza but is a funny one and it has a lot of funny mechanics to beat your enemies or jump car to car for instance. The radio has a great selection of catchy asian songs wich you will enjoy listening during rides on such lovely city.The game is not that long but it has a lot of side quest, easter eggs, funny NPC's and replayability. This version of steam has a HD Texture pack. It changes a lot how it looks ;) The only downsides are some little details that don't break the experience like the camera control.P.D.

												A very good game.The star of the game is obviously Hong-Kong itself. I have no idea if it bears any ressemblance to the real city, but Hong-Kong in Sleeping Dogs is a town bustling with life, with shops everywhere and citizens going about their business. It feels like an actual place where people live, rather than a succession of hotspots for a player to experience like you find in other sandbox games. For someone not native to an Asian culture, it's also a very attractive jump into a different culture.As for the gameplay, it's solid. The car handling is great, and it's a real pleasure to drive around the city, just for fun. The melee fight, though somewhat limited, is still satisfying, especially after you get a few upgrades that allow you to fight like you want. As for the gunfight, it's extremely fun, especially the action scenes when you're gunning down enemies while in a car. It feels like an HK-action film.However, the game is not perfect. The story is servicable, but not much more. It's somewhat disjointed here and there, and not believable at all. There are also a few things that lack polish, like the Car Valet system which fail you regularly for unknown reasons, or the taxi system, which use the same button as the car thief, making for some awkward mistakes. Theses are small things, but they do add up, and that's something you wouldn't find in Saint Rows III or GTA IV (even though i dislike that game). Finally, the game is too easy, with no way to customize the difficulty, which is somewhat sad for people looking for a challenge.On the whole, the game provides a very nice experience, especially if you enjoy the Asian setting. But in the heavy weight category of open-city sandboxes, its few misteps make it falls down a notch compared to games like Arkham City (which has a much better melee combat), or Saint Rows III (which has more variety and polish). Still if you like the open-world genre, you will not regret buying Sleeping Dogs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Open world Grand Theft Auto meets the combat system of Batman: Arkham Asylum.   Add an outstanding voice cast, character customization (clothing, not structure), and a light ""perk system,"" and you have one hell of a game.   a recommended buy at any time, but definitely do not pass this up during a Steam sale if you're waiting on it.

												a pretty decent sand box game. im not a fan of the hardcore parkour things they tried pulling off, like freerunnings cool but its literally just press space to do x when it comes to running.this games also notorious for QTE in the middle of fights or just in general its ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful. sometimes the game doesnt even respond mainly because its not that great of a pc port. you might have to reassign keys to get past certain QTEs mainly because the game doesnt responddrivings a mixed bag. again, this is a pretty okay pc port, so there's obviously some kinks. it's super hard to pull off sharp turns and in general its annoying to do what you want to. however, there is a system implemented to make driving easier. it allows you to shift lanes on the fly. its hell to get used to, but it can help you out in the long run. ontop of that, you can switch cars... from your own car. theres racing but surprisingly, its even worse than GTAIV's street races.gunplay is... generic. i dont like how the guns are in this game, every gun in this game feels loose and sloppy. the bullets really dont go where you want them to. there's also a way to slow down time, but thats only if you execute a hardcore parkour ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t maneuver. in the end, the gun play will make you wish that you're playing max payne or something. in short it's crude, unrefined and uninspiredthe martial arts aspect of the game is cool, but really it's just clicking the mouse button X amount of times and holding it to perform some move. theres a lot of ways to finish off your opponents with ""environment kills"". it can get a bit sloppy especially with the amount of enemies they throw at you in some parts, other than that it's probably the biggest mechanic they focused on.given that your character is essentially an azn batman, he also can hack into anything and pick locks. lockpicking is probably the most braindead puzzle in the entire game, as it only serves to waste your time. locating calls is interesting but its just a memory game. planting bugs is just... why? its literally just holding down onto an arrow key and moving your mouse around in a box until you find the right place. hacking into computers/cameras is essentially just a really simple numbers game. other than that, they're really basic mini-games.the best aspect of this game is how it brings together all of these generic and mediocre mechanics together with it's storymode. its story telling is really what keeps the game playable, at least for me. get the game when its on a sale, it's defnitely worth a purchase but not for the 25 dollar asking price.

The main task, except for the lateral quests you can do is extend the duration of gameplay.  Karaoke, cockfighting, go for a massage etc., adds a separate color with game.

												I know, it looks like i've only played this game for seven hours, but a few days after I bought it, it went free on xbox (my luck), and I thought I might as well play it there for the achievments (steam achievments are useless). I first thought this game would be mediocre, as I haven't heard anything about it. Luckily, I gave it a shot for $5 on steam, and it turned out to be the best game of 2012 imo. This game is like GTA expect better. Now, before the fanboys come charging in, let me explain. Its melee is far better than GTA, its story is one of the best stories in a game in recent memory, and was good enough to make me actually want to beat it. The driving is at least better than gtaIV (gtaV may be better than SD, never played it), and the gunpay was about the same as gta. I will say the open world is a bit lacking though, and there aren't enough side missions. The setting was better too, it was a nice change from the typical LA or NYC.  Now, back to the story. It is good all around, but the last 3 hours or so really blew me away.  The character development was so good that *spoilers* I was cheering and clapping at the end when I finally got to grind up (I mean grind up, I threw him in an ice grinder) the main enemy, and then, five minutes later, I was cheering again when *more spoilers* I jailed the ***hole police chief for life. It was very touching and overall a great end to a great game. Please support this game, the publisher think it was a commercial failure even though it sold over 2 million copies. This is one of the best games i've played in a long time, and I can't stress it enough.			",79,3,1,12,7,1,3

												If you are a fan of Jackie Chan's a 'New Police Story' or any of the old fashioned Chinese police movies for that matter; this is definitely the game for you. It captures the vibrancy and hustle of Hong Kong with beautiful graphics and clever AI that makes the city feel real, gritty and busy; something I have rarely seen a game accomplish so well. The driving is well balanced as are the fighting and shooting mechanics; none of which ever felt repetitive or overpowered during my 42 hour play-through. The main Character Shen had an interesting story to tell and I feel Square Enix did well in development as I found him an engaging protagonist that walked the frequent line of oblivion.In short, I highly recommend picking up this game if you want to play something a little different to the norm. It is fun, immersive and captures the heart of China even if the ending is a shameless setup for the next game.8/10			",132,22,1,15,5,2,9

												good undercover-cop plot and nice fighting action with rather less shooting. open world was rather boring in my opinion, but you can forget about the open world if you just follow the two story lines. i personally wouldn´t recommend any DLC since they are not worth it (you can buy them if you finished the game and still want to spend more time with it). two important thigs to note: 1. DO NOT buy the german low violence version since the environment kills (which are an essential fun part of the fighting scenes) are cut out there and 2. DO play with a gamepad (xbox controller) if you want to enjoy the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A GTA lookalike open world sandbox playing in Hong Kong with extremely nice and fluid visuals and the best in class combat system.Golden bits:First and foremost the combat system. This is absolutely the best in the game and the best combat I ever had the chance of playing in a game that is not purely a combat game. Or maybe even including those. Combat is super fluid and adapts wonderfully to the situation while not featuring ridiculously complicated controller button combos.The abundance of good looking chicks. I mean this game features an extremely high percentage of 10/10 females wandering the streets of this city.  Mrs. Chu without a doubt. One cannot not like her to the point handling of the butcher knife. Your apartment in Central. Great shed - too bad the toilet seems to be always full of some yellow substance.Stinky bits:FOW inside apartments. While the FOW is OK during the action sequences in the city it gets terribly narrow inside apartments. Instant vomit.Racing sequences. There are 18 of these and strictly not fun. I am not saying they are difficult they are just the worst executed bits of an otherwise great game. Vehicle damage modelling. Sucks. Cars take a stupidly large amount of punishment before they explode.The 2 DLCs with achievements. They are extremely dragged out and boring. They also take away some of the skills you already got in the main game which is mad. I suggest playing the DLCs before finishing the main game in case you would wanna go for a 100% completion - otherwise they would feel very much like a bad afterthought.Stat award achievements. It is not nice having got to grind these after finishing the game. Not nice at all.All in all it is still very much Recommended. (8/10)			",118,49,1,39,14,3,37

												This. This is simply one of the most awesome games I've ever played ! First missions are boring, but then, you will love it. It's not like GTA. It's better. Actually, in my opinion, it's more fun and it has absolute amazing storyline. Also the best thing in this game is combat. Well, if you can't just break someone's leg or arm in real life, do it here ! However, it's sad you can't broke fences or stuff like that. And there's not much parkour routes. But still, don't mind about these problems. There's one bigger. When you are in combat, camera is sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you can't see the action. Also there's not so much checkpoints, but if you pay attention and you're being careful, you don't have to die, so checkpoints are at this point useless.

												An under-rated, open world, third person action game.  I was particularly impressed with the melee system; I'm not a fan of fighting games (can't remember all the combos) but found this to be both approachable and enjoyable.  Hong Kong has a fantastic vibe that gives it presence all it's own.  Driving has a wonderful feel of speed while still being controllable.  If you enjoy the GTA or Saints' Row series be sure to give this a shot.Note: The bulk of my SD play was on the X360 version; I enjoyed it so much I purchased the PC version.  PC features a hi-res texture pack and is (in my opinion) the definitive version best of the original versions.  See below.Note: The original version of SD is no longer available. The replacement is the Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition. It includes all the DLC, upgraded graphics, upgraded crowds and roads, etc. The game now takes advantage of current hardware to add more people to crowds, more cars to the roads, etc. 50% off for owners of the current version.

												Rating 8/10Sleeping Dogs is an open world action-adventure video game developed by United Front Games and Square Enix London. The game has you infiltrating the ranks of the Triads as undercover cop.For all those who liked combat from Arkham City (and Asylum), movement from AC or big city and lots of exploration like in GTA (not that big of course) this game will be like a sweet. In overall  story is good (not great and not too long), combat sometimes can be little clumsy and it is easy once you get into it and missions sometimes can feel repetitive.  Despite all that I had tons of fun and I would recommend it to all of you who liked previous mentioned games.			",36,6,0,11,3,0,0

												Pretty good game, with some interesting locations and combat.Postitives:- A fun blend of hand-to-hand combat and firefights, with some cool car chases.- The player character is highly mobile, making it easy and fun to get around the city, both on foot and while driving.- An ""ok"" story, with quite a lot of side activities and some funny moments- Experience points, upgrades and bad cop/good cop elements brings some more meat to the gameNegatives:- The pacing can be a bit weird, especially the last parts of the game, which are very rushed and don't seem to be planned out very much. ""♥♥♥♥♥♥- we're out of time! Just cobble some guns and stuff together!""- The hand-to-hand combat, while fun, can be a bit repetitious, without you really needing to use most of the combos that you learn during the game.- The game could have been so much more. Many of the elements in the game are not very deep, and sometimes the game seems a bit ""cut"". I'm guessing the designers had something more planned, but time or costs got in their way.All in all, a pretty good game.			",46,6,0,11,4,0,18

												Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Voice Acting: 10/10Campaign: 10/10Read on for my opinion on Sleeping DogsSleeping Dogs was a game I wasn't sure about at first. It looked too linear, not enough weapons or vehicles, possibly a garbage campaign. But I bought this game when it was on sale to try it anyways. Needless to say im blown away. This Game has an immense focus on fighting and hand to hand combat whichy is suprising given the GTA style free roaming. Another great thing is the wide diversity of vehicles at your expense to use. With multiple races and side missions to play in game, having different vehicles to test out and play around with sure is a blast. Manuvering the city is also a fun little challenge due to the crowded streets of Honk Kong, it makes it sometimes hard to get away fromm the cops as easily as you'd like. Another thing is the campagin. I figured it would be like GTA, or Saints row, where you're part of a gang and you go do illegal things over and over. But nope, your character is Wei Shen, and undercover cop! Thats something I really loved about this game. The Campaign was so fresh and different. And massive credit to the voice actors of the game! The interactions between Wei shen and the Honk Kong PD as well as fellow Gangs was superb! You will definetly get your moneys worth out of this game AND the DLC. If you havn't picked up Sleeping Dogs already, do your game library a solid and add it to your collection!			",161,13,2,17,12,0,6

												Grand Theft Auto: China. That's almost a dead accurate representation of what this game is. Although you play a cop and not just some vigilante going home or starting out a crime bid. Other than that it's pretty much Grand Theft Auto.You run can around the City scape looking for Cars, Money Boxes, Red Envolopes, Statues, and occationally Call up some chicks so you can have dates with them. The Main Weapon of this game is your Fists, there is no weapon cycling, you either have a weapon or you don't and chances are you will not have a weapon on you when an enemy pulls one out so you have to rely on your own disarming abilities to get the upper hand and thankfully the game gives you power ups to improve your abilities in hand to hand combat making fighting much easier and fun. Also the Fighting mechanics are pretty much ripped straight off of The Arkham Games, so if you're pretty keen on that you're pretty much set with this game. Overall Sleeping Dogs is a great experience. I really like the atmosphere of this game and it gets really easy to get lost in this game just by driving around or walking around and just taking in the whole Chiniese experience.This is worth a buy.

												I kept coming back to play this almost every night after work until I finished off the main story - and I'm a habitutal non-completer of games, specifically open world sandbox or role playing. And I got sick of GTA titles around the Vice City era, so if that's not a good enough recommendation, here's a little more info on why this should be in your library:1. Sleeping Dogs keeps the pacing fresh in the main storyline missions by offering either the Cop or Triad, so you're not always just shooting uzis out car windows at speedbikes, or planting bugs. And even if you decide to stick with one of the other for a bit, the mission variance is creative and allows for some memorable moments created by the sheer amount of awesome (or completely wrong) things that can happen.  The fact you are a cop changes how you act as well, which I also appreciated in contrast to other games which give you no moral standard to follow.2. The hand-to-hand fighting system is excellent, and the time spent breaking arms and slamming heads into cars out weighs the gun play time by about 80/20. This makes the armed combat feel more dangerous and gritty, since you are opting for outright murder instead of going fist to fist with thugs. When I did go around eliminating street gangs with a pistol, and they were only armed with fists and knives, I felt both powerful and also a tad evil as they ran away from me... which most other games water down by having that be the only option for most encounters.3. Driving is exhilerating. The cars all sound nice and beefy, and weaving in and out of traffic is a blast.Cons:-A few pretty bad collision bugs where you'll stick to a car and fly around the city a bit (hilarious, albeit)-The super easy Karaoke minigames are mandatory to progress some missions, and take forever. Funny for maybe 5 seconds.-Powerups via street vendors were a good idea, but not enough variance or real benefit to warrant stopping for them.-All the towns look kind of same-y - could have used a rural area to drive around in.-The parkour bits were frustrating, no matter how good you were, you couldn't catch the dude until they wanted you to, or got into a car and ran them over (if that mission allowed it).-No car customization/painting :(			",128,14,3,5,7,0,16

												This game is by farm the best open world crime game I have ever played. Grand theft auto and saints row sagas are repetitive and normal to the genre, the hong kong setting, the story-line, the different stuff you can do, it leaves u screaming for more. The fighting gameplay is immersive and real. The story line is incredible and feels like an hong kong movie. And the graphic style is stunning. The hong kong bright lights and colours (and chop-shops) are the perfect place to set a game like this and it brings a twist to the normal grey of the LA or detroit scene. Amazing game well worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""It's like GTA sandbox esque mixed with Batman Arkham combat"". That's pretty much what got me into buying Sleeping Dogs. This game is in fact exactly that, BUT, storywise it excelled all my expectations. As an undercover cop trying to bring down the triads, the story is quite rich with nice ups and downs and side missions that really got me into doing them as in opposite to just skipping and heading to the main story. Some fighting missions are quite nice where you learn new martial arts techniques, also the girlfriends missions are a bit fun where at the end of them you are rewarded with new things showing on minimaps and the racing quests are awesome. Actually, GTA could learn a thing or two about driving with Sleeping Dogs.			",189,17,2,15,16,1,18

												this game is okay. Short version, buy it if you want. Long version, oh boy.Sleeping dogs is about this one character ""Wei Chen"", an undercover cop. His story is pretty meh and his family is not really mentioned (from the picture next to his bed). This game has soo much that it cant handle it. The hacking and the bug recalibration is sometimes pretty annoying. If you like it, then sure buy it. There are tons of bugs, sometimes its the ai bugging out or something not showing up. It made me ragequit a lot of times. The fighting aspect is so-so. The Counter is buggy, it wont lock on if you covered in two or three enemies. The voice acting is pretty awesome, kept me playing. The ""fight"" between cop Wei and Triad Wei is pretty small, I wished they could of had two endings, if you maxed out on either cop or triad. The shooting is so so, maybe trying to compete with GTA or Saints Row but it can have its own wowness. The graphics are good. It is a good thing since my laptop is a mid to low gaming laptop. The songs on the radio should be compiled more than the same five or six songs. If you like this, then sure buy it. OH and sometimes the game crashes or freezes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs has been a lot of fun.  If you can handle the combat in the Batman Arkham games, you can do some wicked Kung Fu in this game.  Favorite DLC was Drunken Fist, it's just like something out of a Jackie Chan movie.  Very do-able on a keyboard and mouse, even the racing. You get stronger through the game, and though the enemies get a little tougher, not much.  So if you get your butt kicked somewhere you can come back later for payback. And so many ways to kill the bad guys! Run them over, stab them, shoot them, stick their heads in rotating fans, even smash them through fish tanks and beat their buddies to death with the fish!  If you like Saints Row you will probably like this, especially with the Wheels of Fury DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This totally surprised me. Honk Kong is great place for sandbox game, and map is quite damn large. Game is mostly based on melee combat, but you'll also have weapons later in game. Melee system is great, it has lots of different moves to learn. Game has lots of vehicles, motorcycles and cars. You can steal any car from street as you should, or you can pay taxidriver to take you where you want if you're too lazy to drive yourself, and then rob his car. Most cars are fast, and pretty easy to control. You can buy yourself cars, which will be added to garage.Storyline is about undercover cop, if someone did not know that, it is interesting, but nothing spectacular. Sound acting is in  English, and some Chinese phrases are part of it.Game has about 20 hours of gameplay, which also includes some of collectibles.I was interested in this game, and decided to buy it when it was on sale. I do not regret buying it, it is great game, one of my favorites in 2012. ",954,273,26,84,87,9,85

It ruined the whole ""working from the bottom"" storyline, as I am now richer than 99% of the world, I have the fastest cars and enough clothing to pull off anything.			",308,69,3,48,32,4,76

												This is actually really good.  There are elements of the old True Crime: LA that it used to be a sequel to, but it's also kept up with the times.  I normally get somewhat paralyzed by choice overload in these open world games, but the story in this is actually really involving, so there's always reason to keep progressing it.   There's a lot to like here, especially if you appreciate the subtle details about how as the game progresses and you are forced to go further and further past the line of the law, your actions start to reflect that.  Good♥♥♥♥♥♥  Would recommend.			",565,212,5,135,53,4,150

I never encountered any bugs or crashes and it supports XInput without any issues.It's not the biggest sandbox with the most toys but what it does have are really fun to play with. :D I very nearly 100% completed this game with about 40 hours put in, all in maybe a 10 day period. I say this as a positive - while it lasted, the game really had its hooks in me.Considering the the effort it took to even get this game released, it is excellent.			",653,186,30,90,49,9,46

												Square Enix really did a fantastic job reviving this game. The sandbox open world experience of Sleeping Dogs is really well done, and they filled Hong Kong with a ton of stuff to do.The gameplay is nothing special but it still feels great, from driving, shooting and fighting it's just really fun. The story and characters in the game were amazingly well done, i really liked the work they did with Wei Chen, switching him from an undercover cop to a Triad member and reveal how it affects his life and those around him.The graphics are some of the most beautiful i've ever seen in a game, i was really impressed with the light filled streets of Hong Kong, the shiny cars on rainy days or just a normal day.A great game overall, it's worth every cent.

												Essentially a GTA kind of clone, only set in Hong Kong. Immersion is pretty good, ranging from driving on the left to NPCs using different dialects. Combat aspires to be as smooth as Batman Arkham City, but falls short of being smooth and seamless. The combat is focused around melee and gunplay isn't that polished. Quite little replayability, story was mediocre. At full price, I wouldn't recommend getting it but during a sale (say around $6), it's a steal.Pros:-Immersive-Parkour around Hong Kong is pretty original Cons:-Gunplay unpolished-Little replayability-City begins to feel dull and lifeless after a few minutes in free roam			",90,9,3,4,12,0,19

												As a fan of Hong Kong cinema, the way Sleeping Dogs depicts its story had me attached to the plot, characters and setting from start to finish. Every character has personality, and while there isn’t a stand out individual, each one feels developed enough for you to care about their associations with Wei and it helps that the voice acting is fantastic. The game’s length is about 15-hours with side missions extending to double that. The first three hours of Sleeping Dogs demonstrate a lot of the improvements to the GTA gameplay with the traversal free running and hand-to-hand combat. Hand-to-hand combat is heavily inspired by the Batman: Arkham series of video games, with Wei being able to punch, grapple and counter to victory. Grappling is a rather good move in Sleeping Dogs. Not only is it used to throw people over edges or pound them to the ground, but it allows Wei to interact with environmental objects as a way to deal extreme damage. Story missions are mainly great. Side missions are a different story. Most are fillers where you are chasing people, racing cars, beating people up, singing Karaoke, hacking, nothing all that exciting compared to the main plot. The cars handle well with their super arcade-like feel, and the gun combat is mostly solid, with Wei able to pull off bullet time when jumping over cover, helping with aiming headshots.Having seen all the versions on display, there is no denying that the PC version of Sleeping Dogs is well above the graphics of the console version. I had all settings set to the highest (PC Specs: i5, GeForce 660ti, 8GB RAM) and the framerate kept above 60 throughout the whole game. It’s the world that makes Sleeping Dogs’ graphics stand out, with the city looking stunning with the downloaded high resolution pack, showcasing the neon lights blasting their rays across the road and glowing up the night of Hong Kong.

												So, I have just beaten Sleeping Dogs. I must say, this game is probably the best game to have come out in 2012. You play as Wei Shen, an undercover Hong Kong police officer who has the task of infiltrating the biggest triad in Hong Kong: Sun On Yee. The story is set up beautifully, almost like a chess board. You start out working with the other pawns in the triad and as the story evolves, you meet all the other pieces of the board. And like in the game of chess, pieces are moved and taken away as the game progresses. The charecters are also very black and white like chess pieces in which you know who your enemies are, and you know who your friends are. There's no reach-arounds or deception, which is a plus in this sort of game. Gameplay is very much like a stew. There are pieces of other games that are brewed together and made into something good and unique. You have the freerunning of Assassin's Creed, the combat is very much like the Batman series of games, the HUD layout is almost exactly like Grand Theft Auto IV's. The driving is actually kinda bad in the game because all the cars and motorcycles go incredibly fast for the tight confines of Hong Kong's streets. But when you ride shotgun in a car and do the shooting while an AI drives, it is amazing.The content in this game is nearly unending. You have a ton of side missions, street races, drug busts, dates, clothing and cars to buy, cop missions, and even more if you get some of the DLC. The main missions are quite well done, though there doesn't seem to be much creativity put into them. But that's okay, because the game is just so fun you don't really notice it until you look back on it. The charecters are very good in the game. With your own charecter, you get to see the battle he has with himself, the police, and the triads. You see him start to blur the lines and get his hands dirty while trying to keep on the straight and narrow. You get attached easily and heartbroken when bad things happen. I think the charecters are the best aspect they did of this game. I would say my final rating will have to be a 10/10. There is almost nothing wrong in this game. Highly recommended.

												A friend got me this game saying it was rather decent. The sale was on and well i decided to say yes, from what i had seen, the game didn't look to bad, looked fun but also looked a little boring, which left me a little unwanting to play it. The steam sale was on when my friend got it me, so i had all of the DLC along with the game, which being honest, is a lot, from two extra DLC missions which add on, to ones which add to your triad and police level, to cars and clothes. There's plenty given from this to help gain your interest within the game. So, from that being said, lets start from the beginning. From my own slight worries and fears for the game, the opening looked promising, controls are standard and decent but felt a little clunky at first, i played more and got past the opening. The story showed it's inital idea and the concept was rather interesting but was... slow to really push this idea until much later on in the game.Once the story had been laid out and i had done the starting missions i found myself sitting there for 15 minuets as it showed me all of the DLC, what it had given me, and all the bonuses.. Which is great and all.. But it meant that my Triad and police levels shot to level 8, same with face meter, meaning by a quater way in i was max leveled on triad and police. It meant i could do more fun earlier on, but made the game a little ""to"" easy as it clearly laid out missions with mind off you gradually gaining upgrades, but, it was still fun to be kicking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of enemies from the start and feeling like a Kung Fu master.After a few hours into the game the story had been slow. Wasn't gaining my interest and the side missions were fun up to a certain amount of time, even with all the extra content given out to me. So, i ended up leaving this on the side, in my libary for a time. I eventually came back after a few weeks and decided to have another go, i had an issue with the game crashing, easily fixed by validating the files but still was a pain. I opened my save and didn't remember anything, nothing suck in or stuck with me for the weeks, but, determined from reviews and some walkthroughs i started another new game and worked my way up to the place i was. But this time, i found myself more involved into the story when i started to understand the situation the player is in, what you're doing, and why the story is so evidently slow from the go. I managed to start to work my way through and found myself becoming more and more engrossed into the storyline, but not just that, i found myself starting to have conflict between being a traid and being an undercover police officer, something, that isn't easy to do, question a player: Are you a traid? Or are you still an officer? Especially when you can just run down people without stress, kill police officers, break speeding limits and more. Depending on this it kinda made me think well where do i go. I moved into the police cases aspect to the game then. The cases are a welcome additon, technically, a side mission spanning through the game the police cases are truly interesting and allow for you to keep to your roots as an officer while being drawn more and more into the crazy, murdering world of the traids. The missions slowly unlock as you play through the main missions, all cases being diverse into what you look into and some even being rather shocking from the final result. But in the end, you still feel like you've made an achievement into solving them and trying to stick to being a cop. Especially when you go from missions stealing/Killing and all this, to doing something for the better.From being more into the game now i took a look at the aspects of gameplay. Fighting was solid, guns felt powerful and fun to use and even driving on a keyboard and mouse was very enjoyable and responsive. Fighting is similar to that of Batman: Arkham series where you hit people with combos and then counter attacks as they start to come in landing on you. Despite feeling like a kung-fu god, going more and more in lead me to being killed and defeated easily by larger eneimes and more in groups. So i explored, found health shrines to take more hits, and went and found the statues to learn more moves as well, it made it interesting but, the statues are all generally in the way in missions, making searching for them kinda irrelivent, it's almost like they put them in the way in missions so you pick them up anyway and learn the moves, not like you have to go looking to truly gain an upper hand, just a way of slowly keeping your fighting up to par with the rest. Despite that, it was still very, very fun and the fighting never really got repetative when you're breaking someones leg and then flying kicking someone else in the head.So i had gotten later in. SPOILER  To the point where Wei had become a red pole, moving up the ranks, working for uncle Poe and managing to learn more about the higher ranks of the triads  And i found myself being more and more drawn in, especially to the traid side, beggining more to forget about my police side and loose myself in order to gain more into the traids. It was around here i found that sleeping dogs wasn't afraid to deal with much more horrid situations. The game had been very tame, not a lot of blood, some decent fighting but nothing counting as shocking.Until... The wedding...  Boy, did the game soon show me is was taking it more seriously, and was not afraid to show much more graphical violence, showing me the world of which i was trying to get into. It showed the horror of what can happen inside of this world and the danger i was in.  Especially when you see Wei in a blood stained suit, trying to comfort a dying Winston  It showed me it was prepared to shock me and show me more of the horrors of the world, making it show, sleeping dogs was able to remain serious and deal with these situations in a decent way. Past that the game toned down a little but the story, REALLY, picked up for me. It moved up more and more, making it even more interesting and getting me even more into it, so much so, i found myself playing it late at night as the battle between being with the triads and being a police officer forever was nagging there, and was clearly showing for Wei as well. Much later in and near the end a lot happened, a lot had to be taken in, the game had built up this tension that just.... fell short. The ending felt like all this tension and hard work into getting me to think of either being a triad or police just wasn't brought to a full conclusion. For those who have finished.  The ending felt like you either kill big Smile Lee as either an officer of the law, or as revenge for him killing your triad friends . For those who haven't, the ending only makes you feel like you've done it for one side or the other... and nothing else than that, which was a damn shame to all that hard work going into it. Regardless, it was still fun and enjoyable. Before the ending there is also another bloody scene, which i warn, those who cannot stand blood or worse, look away when it happens, and trust me, you know when it will. Overall sleeping dogs truly got me into it, got me to battle how i felt with being an undercover cop and got me to see the grousome side of everything which happened and could happen in such a game. I look forward to the DLC and would recommend this to anyone. It is slow to get into, but damn fun and interesting once you do get into it. I would say buy with all the DLC as well, as it's more worth it that way, but either way, sleeping dogs is a damn good game and i would rate it 9/10 from everything i've played. Just make sure that during some scenes you're prepared, as much as the game seems a little goofy, it handles some truly horrifying moments seriously and well.			",171,22,1,16,13,3,5

												One of my favourite open world games, it has a great story (a story about Undercover Police joining Triad. You rarely see this combination) and great gameplay (especially the parkour thing :3)The graphic are good, and the game doesn't require a high spec rig :)Also, it has an interesting missions, but sometime it kinda repetitive :/Totally worth it for me ;)7.5 / 10 ",140,19,10,16,9,1,15

												Sleeping Dogs is a masterpiece of open world game play, bringing many different game mechanics flawlessly into one.Character development is amazing and very likable, with many twists and turns right throughout the main storyline. The voice acting is arguably the best I've seen in games of recent, you get attached to the dialogue and the mood of some scenes is somewhat of a movie rather than a game. Combat is top notch with the kung fu fights, which you can progress even further with Wei Shen unlocking new melee skills. Gun play is also very good, not being too overly emphasised as much as melee, which is better in some way, as the melee is one of the games selling points. Being open world you are given the freedom of Hong Kong. There is always something to do while you explore the streets, from random evens which can pop up at any corner which challenge you in different scenarios to finding many hidden lock boxes scattered around. This makes the game refreshing and can give you some surprises. With a myriad of game mechanics and a story that really grips you, this rightfully gets a 9/10.			",52,4,1,5,1,0,3

												The very first game I bought on Steam during a sale (I just dropped by randomly and decided it's too good to pass up, lol!), and I gotta say it's quite good - definitely a must-have if you like third person shooter / sandbox games.Sleeping Dogs is quite similar in GTA with its freeroam and side tasks aside from the Main Story. The biggest difference however, you don't get to use firearms too often - instead, Martial Arts plays a major in this game. Wei Shen, your character, is so skillful that he can stand up against 10+ enemies with just his fist, and he is able to intercept any attacks as long as you time your QTE just right - nothing more satisfying than beating up tons of big guys and walk away unscathed! The game centers around Triad activities, so you still get to shoot bad guys every once in a while, especially during later missions.One good thing about Sleeping Dogs, it's very easy to play. You get all kind of help text and instructions, and the Tutorial missions are easy to follow up. Even if you are new to TPS / Sandbox, you can master the control in no more than a few hours. The map is quite big with collectibles and side stuff you can complete during freeroam / after finishing the story, and bonuses are nice too (both for easing gameplay and/or improving Shen's abilities). Even at Medium setting (I have x86 system so it don't have 4 GB RAMs), the graphics still look good and smooth - most of the time I have stable 45 FPS, which is lowered down to 30 when too much stuff show up. This is where Sleeping Dogs is WAY better than Saint Row The Third.However, there are still a few problems here and there - first, partial custom control is annoying. I mainly play on Arrow section, but for Sleeping Dogs I am forced to use WSAD because arrow keys and enter/backspace can't be reassigned - the devs are too lazy to make graphics for all keyboard layout so they just go cheap and force you to use their setting - not cool. Another thing, Sleeping Dogs is scripted to force you to play missions in a linear way - you can't bring weapons in because the story says so, and you can't keep weapons after the mission because the story says so. This makes me regret ever purchasing all those DLCs, only to find their perks CANNOT be used in the main story mission to make it more fun. Last but not least, some interaction are so fussy at time - walking up to a food vendor and press button only to find Wei does nothing yet they still talk like the deal is done, very funny.But overall, Sleeping Dogs is a good game - Activision really did a stupid move by throwing it away, otherwise I believe it'd did its original job; rebooting True Crime series. That, for us, is also a good thing because now Sleeping Dogs has become its own series, with Triad War sequence announced already. I'll definitely give it a try once it hits Steam, assuming my PC can still handle it.			",55,2,0,0,3,0,0

												Being a renegade kung-fu fighter, a rogue undercover cop avenging his dead sister, in a well depicted Hong-Kong, is a lot of fun in Sleeping Dogs. Cook a guy's face on hot plates, stab his heart with a swordfish; there are tons of way to kill a poor soul that are way more fun than using guns. The story is pretty good and pretty often, you feel like you're in a movie. When you're not killing triad members or out shopping for new clothes and bracelets, you can do pretty much everything you want: bet on♥♥♥♥♥♥fights, race cars and bikes in the docks, play mahjong...By the end of the game, Wei Shen will be your new definition of a real Badass with sick tats.Also you can sing Take On Me by a-ha, try finding that in a kungfu fighting game!

												Sleeper hit, great game, For an open world sandbox (gta style) game, this has suprisingly deep story that will grip you from beggining to end. Even though it's sandbox, and lets you go free, the game does a great job at directing you and making you ACTUALLY feel like a part of the world, unlike how GTA just makes you feel like a crime spree driven sociopath. Good gameplay, EXCELLENT martial-arts and combat system (that borders on brutal at times with its environmental fatalities), this game is a must play for anyone who likes a good sandbox game, or simply a good undercover cop story.

												It doesn't offer a great deal that can't be found in other open-world games, but the flipside is that it's also almost entirely free of the guff that drags many of its competitors down. Sleeping Dogs is a lean, refined GTA clone with an emphasis on putting as much of the game at your fingertips as early and often as possible.Gameplay boils down to melee, gunplay and driving sections. Melee fights are the most prevalent part of the game and anyone who's played the Arkham games will feel right at home with the counter-driven one-button fighting here. Melee weapons and environmental kills are offered for some variety but don't add much complexity or depth. Shootouts can be conducted as either an exercise in cover-based pop-and-shoot mechanics (if you're boring), or a more arcadey system where stylish kills can be chained together to rack up continuous bullet time. It's very reminiscent of John Woo's Stranglehold and handily my favourite part of the game, although it errs on the side of being a bit too easy. Driving is fairly standard; cars handle well with the right amount of weight and chases are enlivened somewhat by the presence of that same chained bullet-time mechanic as well as the ability to freely hop from one car to another a la Just Cause.The game's simulated Hong Kong is wonderfully detailed and always lovely to look at, but you'll find that it's not hiding a great deal of interesting content to be discovered. Aside from stores dotted around the place, you'll only ever really find yourself heading from map marker to map marker for story missions or sidequests. The obvious debt the game owes to classic Hong Kong action/martial arts cinema aesthetically will probably make it more interesting to genre fans (like myself).			",328,64,8,35,25,2,52

												""Like Grand Theft Auto but....""Actually this game has the GTA feel but in a way makes itself unique from other sandbox titles. For one, I got through the whole game without stealing one car, which is saying something. The game is packed with action and it never really feels like a grind. The melee combat is smooth and responsive, kinda like arkham asylum and Yakuza. The shooting works, but not as crisp as other 3rd person perspective games.What your comming for is the story, which follows an undercover cop, Shen, as he infiltrates one of Hong Kong's Triad. The story is engaging and moving, especially in the third act when♥♥♥♥♥♥starts hitting the fan. It does have it fair share of generic COP movie quotes. ""THATS IT IM PULLING YOU OFF THE CASE"" ""NO YOU WONT BECAUSE OF XY REASON"". It has a nice pacing, with some room for multiple run throughs. I finished the story in about 10 hours, with many more dedicated to goofing around. It also has its fair share of DLC.TLDR, Great story with good gameplay. If its on sale give it a world.

												First off I want to say that I was a bit skeptical of this game. I'm usually a bit picky when it comes to open world games. I have been disappointed in the past with games that claim to be open world but are actually just bigger world games with a relatively linear path. With that said, this game IS open world similar to GTA but not as robust or in depth as GTA gets with the side missions weapons, cars, missions, etc but it does get pretty linear at times. Don't let that scare you away though. This game is incredibly fun and has a lot of great elements to it. The Asian atmosphere it brings is  awesome. I don't think it really captures the true Asian organized crime background that much but it does a good job in its own way. If you're a fan of Bruce Lee/Jackie Chan/Jet Li martial arts movies you will like this game. They stuck a lot of cliche situations in this game that resemble many of those movies. I don't want to get too in depth and spoil anything but there are some outright mimics of the movies and their plots in certain parts of the game.General game play is fun and satisfying. The graphics are pretty decent once you get the high res xpac. Driving is OK at best.  I use a controller with this game as it feels more comfortable to me when anything driving is involved. I would say that it has its good and bad moments. The drifting mechanic in the game feels a bit weak and makes me want more out of the vehicles. The environments are nice and laid out. I do think that it becomes bland after a while with the same cars, same scenery etc. The towns all look the same for the most part. I dislike the fact that when you put on an outfit you don't get to use its perks in the various missions during the game. One thing I don't like and this is no fault of the game at all it's the nature of being set in the asian country is getting used to driving on the left side of the road. Being a veteran of all the past GTA games and well, living in the US it makes for some difficult reactions. I find myself driving on the right side of the road frequently zoning out on the highways then running head on while trying to avoid traffic. This brings me to my next issue.When you run into ANYTHING it takes away from the police points during your missions. Sometimes this is incredibly difficult and takes away from the game a bit. It could be anything from running into a sidewalk fence to running over a pedestrian. I understand the bigger stuff but even so much as a knick on the fence will cause a negative point towards your police faction score. Anyway, the game is well worth the 6 bucks I spent for the game + all DLC. I really really enjoy it and feel I can get a lot of replay value out of it. I would recommend it to anybody looking for a good solid game to play similar to GTA mixed with the foreign martial arts movies.			",119,13,2,16,3,0,12

												A great game. Although it's from Square Enix so my expectations were already high since I've never seen a terrible game released by them. While the game may seem like a GTA clone to some people, this game does a great job of blending the whole ""good cop, bad"" cop type of gameplay. The game looks as great as it plays too, however the controls could of been slightly better (keyword here being slightly). Personally I wish there was more to do after the game was complete, but the great story and racing activity's as well as the ""face""  activities kept me busy for a while as is. 10/10 I recommend this to anyone, even if you're not a fan of GTA style or ""open world"" style games, you'll still enjoy this one			",97,4,7,16,7,1,5

												I think this game is a really good game, but you must buy the dlc if you wont to get bored after finishing the main part. This game cant be compared with GTA Series even when the genre same (Open World). This games fells So Monotone.. Just like hack and slash games but with more extra Graphic and gameplay. But, the Scemathic Gameplay of this game main parts is unpredictable. I cant imagine what event will going on next.

 Sleeping Dogs Review Before purchasing this game, I highly recommend a good graphics card in order to furthermore enjoy the bloody scenery of this game. At first, Sleeping Dogs is joyful to play, the combat system is great, the story is adequate, the side missions are satisfactory although quite repetitive and the exploration throughout this map is wonderful. Although,  after completing the story and the dlc's, the player feels as if he has nothing else to do, and everything else becomes quite tedious. This game is fun throughout, until the point where you have nothing to do. I highly recommend this game if you have time to kill.			",120,20,0,4,3,0,1

												Is this game on sale? Yeah? Then buy, especially if you like action-adventure games. This game is somewhat similar to a GTA game, so I'll compare it to that. I enjoyed playing through this game much more than any GTA's I've played through. The combat is better, driving feels solid, the story is very well done, and the shooting mechanics surpass that of GTA IV (which arguably has the best ""shooting"" in the series). The one thing Sleeping Dogs does lack, though, is variety in weapons (there are very few guns and melee weapons, solid combat aside), a somewhat generic open-world (while I don't think GTA is much more ""alive,"" I think GTA games provide a better sandbox experience), and there's no multiplayer options for those interested in one (this didn't bother me about the game, but I know some people say ""AW NO MULTIPLAYER I AIN'T BieING""). Overall, the base story mode (non-DLC) took me 16 hours and not once did I get bored during my playthrough, which is kinda rare for a game I knew very little about before purchasing. So, yeah. Buy it.			",283,76,6,13,25,3,16

However it does start to get abit repetative and you start to see alot of props and building ect, used around and about and it starts to look all the same. I do however enjoy the Chinese feel to it and really embracing the calture, its nice to see this in a game.9.5/10Highly recommended for those who love insane Karati skills, Fast cars and bikes and alot of $$$ to customize your character with.Fun game and great to play :DHOME GROWN SPUDS FTW			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Attacks look awesome, counters can interrupt any of your actions and grapples let you use the environment, like throwing a dude into a dumpster or jamming his face through a fish tank. You also have a Face meter, which when full(fills by kicking the crap out of dudes and not getting punched in the face) enemies will flinch and even run away sometimes.			",195,29,8,18,6,2,10

Cook a guy's face on hot plates, stab his heart with a swordfish; there are tons of way to kill a poor soul that are way more fun than using guns. The story is pretty good and pretty often, you feel like you're in a movie.

When it comes to gameplay, I'm not sure about mouse and keyboard since I played purely by controller, but it was fun and the combat was very responsive. The melee combat system is very deep compared to most other games in the genre with its great combos and counter-attacks as well as skill trees but it also features cover-based shooting for all you GTA fans. Driving is alright, but the camera angles at times can be annoying. The game could use a multiplayer mode for racing and free-roam as well. Overall, a great game by any means.

												Sleeper hit, great game, For an open world sandbox (gta style) game, this has suprisingly deep story that will grip you from beggining to end. Even though it's sandbox, and lets you go free, the game does a great job at directing you and making you ACTUALLY feel like a part of the world, unlike how GTA just makes you feel like a crime spree driven sociopath. Good gameplay, EXCELLENT martial-arts and combat system (that borders on brutal at times with its environmental fatalities), this game is a must play for anyone who likes a good sandbox game, or simply a good undercover cop story.

												Engaging combat system and storyline. They kind of gloss over the character background by briefly mentioning it at various times throughout the game, however, it would have been nice if they went more in depth so I could visualize it a bit better; that would help make Wei's actions and motivations more emotionally charged and invest us in the storyline and the game more. It is interesting seeing a game with a ""minority race"" as the main culture and population being explored, as opposed to being the model minority or cheap humor. Keyboard and Mouse controls are pretty whacky and the mouse acceleration is whack; recommend you to play on a controller instead. There were a few characters who should have honestly had a bigger role in the game or should have appeared more. Kind of lacks replay value and incentive to do the additional achievements and missions; however, in terms of a game that is fun to play through for the initial story and gameplay, Sleeping Dogs is an excellent choice. Overall, the game has a strong story, diverse culture, and engaging combat system, but falls off a bit in terms of replay value and additional content after you beat the main story.

												I fell in love with this game the first time I played it. I'd been on the fence regarding buying it since I'd heard a few detractors saying it wasn't as good as GTA. I love the GTA series, but this tops them. Why? Because not only the story is good, but also the fighting mechanic - GTA was never good at fighting, it was all about driving and shooting. Sleeping Dogs brings in the Arkham series' style of freeflow fighting (though not as good as the Arkham games, it's not far off) as well as cool things like being able to jump from one car to another to hijack vehicles, take hostages, have bullet time vault shootings and much more.The game is 2 years old but still looks as good, if not better (at times), than Watch Dogs. It runs really well, too. I was able to run it at ultra settings the day it came out, even with the hi-res PC-only texture pack that was released. Nowadays, I can run it at 2880x1620 (and would expect to run it at 4k, if my monitor supported it).If you've been disappointed by Watch Dogs, then give this a try - I personally find it's more fun than Watch Dogs, allows you to interact with the other people in the environment more and has a great fighting system. It doesn't have all the hacking stuff, and is more action-orientated than stealth based, but that's not always a bad thing in the open world genre.			",716,192,26,80,137,14,102

												Dear Reader,Sleeping Dogs is a spectactular game. With a lovely story where everyone is happy and they gets what they want, it makes for a truely realistic experience of what it is like being a man living in Hong Kong. In Sleeping Dogs, there is no violence or drama, but it makes up for that with lots of heartfelt, family-friendly humor. I have personally put almost 24 hours worth of my time into this game, and I do intend to put more. So, if you do get bored with your mindless slaughter of innocent NPC's, purchase and enjoy Sleeping Dogs today.Love,Fossor_			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs is a great game, not perfect in anyway, but it's still a good experience.Graphics:There good, not the best but the game has a few years on it now. For AMD users like myself, this game is a pleasue, runs so well it's unbelieveable. I run this game 100fps+ maxed and it does look very nice. Graphics are good enough, not much pop-in which is fantastic and people faces look quite nice.Story:Story is alright, it's not the best or the worst. Looking past some of it's major flaws and loop wholes, it serves it's purpose. I wouldn't buy this game for it's story alone though, you need to enjoy the mechanics aswell. Being a double agent puts a nice spin on things, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Lots of twists are predictable sadly, and slow turn of cop into bad guy is very generic.Mechanics: Hand to Hand combat is beautiful, it's so rare to find a game like this that focuses on close combat instead of guns. Really enjoyed it,  very smooth and the counter system is nice. Only problem is it's a little to easy, especially when you can kill everybody except bosses and grapplers by throwing them into a phonebooth.Overall:Good game, probably one of the best open world titles left that people haven't played. It's no GTA, but it's great to fill that gap while waiting for something else. Game is quite shoot, however, keep in mind I didn't do any sidemissions. I went straight through all the main missions.Nice game, would definitely recommend on sale.Rating: 7/10			",145,3,2,13,8,0,13

												Holy Jesus this game was so much fun. I just finished the story, and it was fantastic. I would compare the feeling I'm having right now to a roller coaster. The game was non-stop fun througout the whole game, and now I have this sudden calmness. The story was THAT great, but there was one thing I loved about it. It never bored me. I could go one mission to the next without wanting to do something else. In fact, I found the story so interesting that I have almost every secondary mission to do now that the game is over. The combat in this game is spectacular is almost exactly like Batman. The combos and way you learn them are almost identical to the game Bully however, which I noticed immediately. The driving is good for an open-world game, and smashing through everything that gets in your way is a blast. This game has been on my backlog for a while now and I highly regret it. This is the most fun I've had in a game in months. As an open-world game, I enjoyed it even more than GTA 4. 10/10.			",152,13,4,27,13,3,9

												An under-rated, open world, third person action game.  I was particularly impressed with the melee system; I'm not a fan of fighting games (can't remember all the combos) but found this to be both approachable and enjoyable.  Hong Kong has a fantastic vibe that gives it presence all it's own.  Driving has a wonderful feel of speed while still being controllable.  If you enjoy the GTA or Saints' Row series be sure to give this a shot.Note: The bulk of my SD play was on the X360 version; I enjoyed it so much I purchased the PC version.  PC features a hi-res texture pack and is (in my opinion) the definitive version best of the original versions.  See below.Note: The original version of SD is no longer available. The replacement is the Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition. It includes all the DLC, upgraded graphics, upgraded crowds and roads, etc. The game now takes advantage of current hardware to add more people to crowds, more cars to the roads, etc. 50% off for owners of the current version.

 Sleeping Dogs Review Before purchasing this game, I highly recommend a good graphics card in order to furthermore enjoy the bloody scenery of this game. At first, Sleeping Dogs is joyful to play, the combat system is great, the story is adequate, the side missions are satisfactory although quite repetitive and the exploration throughout this map is wonderful. Although,  after completing the story and the dlc's, the player feels as if he has nothing else to do, and everything else becomes quite tedious. This game is fun throughout, until the point where you have nothing to do. I highly recommend this game if you have time to kill.			",120,20,0,4,3,0,1

												On the plus side, the story is excellent, the scenery is lovely (I'm tempted to say I now understand why Vancouver looks the way it does ;) and the driving is pretty confident. On the uneven to negative side, the missions, while imaginatively framed, aren't very hard, and there's too much of the rather routine melee fighting. By the back third of the game I was feeling a bit bored, although I saw it through. A shame: a missed opportunity to really go to town in an excellent environment. But it's a little too polite.

What you can expect from Sleeping Dogs:-Boring gunplay-A nice, immersive game world-Immensely entertaining hand-to-hand combat-A very nicely written storyWhat you should not expect:-GTA-esque mass homicide-Good gun mechanics(the guns just seem boring compared to close quarter combat)-Being able to unlock every thing just a few hours inBasically if you are looking for a more mature GTA that plays in a non-americanized part of the world, this is your game.

												While Sleeping Dogs is a little rough around the edges (mainly flaky ""social hub"" service and bizarre controller quirks) the game is actually quite fun. I picked this gem up during a Steam sale and am glad that I did. I've got 10+ hours of play in and expect to continue playing it with or without the ""Social Hub"". Its gameplay is a lot like the GTA series but a larger emphasis on melee combat (like the Batman Arkham series). I wouldn't pay full price for Sleeping Dogs, because of the lack of game updates (the devs are in support mode now and obviously aren't too keen on looking into the issues) to fix bugs and certain game functionally, but you certainly can't go wrong paying < $10 for this game. Just my 2 cents.			",200,24,7,10,9,2,25

												Sleeping dogs may not be the most impressive open world game ever made. Comparing it to the slapstick humour of saints row 3 and 4 or the gritty GTA 4 but what this game does is nothing short of amazing. The story is well written and is full of twists and curveballs. The ending is satisfying and Wei Shen is a man with his own problems which is told beautifully through is interactions with other characters and himself. Though some reviewers may not like this game for what it is not but for what it is simply put, it is “Enter the Dragon The videogame”. A true Square Enix master piece and throughly enjoyed it. 4.5/5 ",203,37,3,20,13,4,41

												Okay seriously stop what you're doing and ask yourself why you don't have this game yet. I expected some fun Chinese crime/Triad shoot'em'up. What I got was a LOT more. Most likeable protagonist I've seen in forever, a gripping story, a great variety of unique, interesting and likeable (or hateable) characters, fun gameplay, and better writing than anything I've seen in this genre to date. If you liked Saints Row, the first and second in particular, give this a try. You won't be disappointed. Have I mentioned this game is ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous (and Wei is, too)?			",212,122,4,59,41,0,30

												A great open-world game. The story of Wei Shen, trying to stay loyal to the police whilst also maintaining his cover amongst Triad members is very tense. It kept me ignoring side missions to see what happens next. And after you've beaten the main story, gone through every race and side mission and collected every item, there are loads of DLC packs that provide even more hours of enjoyable gameplay.

												Sleeping Dogs is an excellent game, a strong contender to make my top 5 of 2012. It has a powerful story with exciting twists and interesting characters, supported by Hollywood quality voice acting and music, and gorgeous graphics. The three core gameplay elements, melee, shooting and driving, while individually not as outstanding as other games that focus on one element, are all good enough to enjoy here. Add in a wide range of side missions and you have a varied experience that is never dull and easily lasts over 15 hours. This is also a good PC port, with plenty of customisation options, the controls work well with keyboard and mouse and there are hardly any bugs. My only complaint is that the undercover setting is kind of wasted. The player never gets to make a meaningful moral choice like ""can I avoid committing this crime without blowing my cover?"". Every mission and plot point is fully scripted, and some players may find themselves disagreeing with Wei's choices.			",144,31,0,15,8,2,16

												Anyone who loves sandbox games, or the Grand Theft Auto series will absolutely love this game. If not, this will be one of those exceptions. You play as Wei Chen, a cop who tries to infultrate the most dangerous gangs in Hong Kong, all whilst trying to stay under cover. The story is set in a beautiful city environment loosely based around Hong Kong. The scenery is fantastic, and there are mods available in the steam workshop to make it even more visually stunning. In addition to that, the story is gripping and the combat system is superb. Within a couple of fights, you've got the hang of fighting for the rest of the game. It develops well, and more complex moves are added when you collect more of the missing statues. The only complaint that I have, is the fact that I completed the main story a little too quickly. A few more missions or added characters or scenes would have been brilliant. However, even after completing it, I still play the game as there are plenty of little odd jobs here and there to do.When this game is going cheap (maybe during the steam sales!) I would say:GRAB IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN. It'll be one of the best games you buy, I can tell you it certainly is one of mine.			",75,9,1,3,13,1,5

												I fell in love with this game the first time I played it. I'd been on the fence regarding buying it since I'd heard a few detractors saying it wasn't as good as GTA. I love the GTA series, but this tops them. Why? Because not only the story is good, but also the fighting mechanic - GTA was never good at fighting, it was all about driving and shooting. Sleeping Dogs brings in the Arkham series' style of freeflow fighting (though not as good as the Arkham games, it's not far off) as well as cool things like being able to jump from one car to another to hijack vehicles, take hostages, have bullet time vault shootings and much more.The game is 2 years old but still looks as good, if not better (at times), than Watch Dogs. It runs really well, too. I was able to run it at ultra settings the day it came out, even with the hi-res PC-only texture pack that was released. Nowadays, I can run it at 2880x1620 (and would expect to run it at 4k, if my monitor supported it).If you've been disappointed by Watch Dogs, then give this a try - I personally find it's more fun than Watch Dogs, allows you to interact with the other people in the environment more and has a great fighting system. It doesn't have all the hacking stuff, and is more action-orientated than stealth based, but that's not always a bad thing in the open world genre.			",716,192,26,80,137,14,102

												Dear Reader,Sleeping Dogs is a spectactular game. With a lovely story where everyone is happy and they gets what they want, it makes for a truely realistic experience of what it is like being a man living in Hong Kong. In Sleeping Dogs, there is no violence or drama, but it makes up for that with lots of heartfelt, family-friendly humor. I have personally put almost 24 hours worth of my time into this game, and I do intend to put more. So, if you do get bored with your mindless slaughter of innocent NPC's, purchase and enjoy Sleeping Dogs today.Love,Fossor_			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs is GTA 4 with parkour and good combat and bullet-time. That's it really. It's GTA 4 mashed up with Hong Kong cinema. It's pretty glorious. The combat in this game is really just a simplified Arkham Asylum, which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good for a GTA clone, considering how wrong they always get it. You've got pretty simple X, X, X, hold X combos, with different amount of X's pre-hold giving you different sweet combos. You've got a grapple that you can follow up with arm-breaking, tossing them off a ledge, or just, you know, bashin' their face in. You have all sorts of sweet kicks. It's pretty martial-artsy of course but it's less trying to look cool (although it does) and more about no nonsense killing dudes with your body. Also you can grab people and throw them in dumpsters or impale them on meat hooks or smash them into a box full of broken glass (yeah I don't know why there are boxes full of broken glass everywhere.) The driving feels good, but I can't remember how driving felt in GTA 4. It probably apes that as well so if you're one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who couldn't deal with that you'll probably hate it. But you can hang out of your car window and shoot out tires and♥♥♥♥♥♥and when you start shooting the game goes into slow motion so you can actually do it without crashing into a wall, which is cool. This is a pretty spergy thing, but I really like the freeway system in this game. It loops around the whole city with lots of nice on-ramps and exchanges everywhere and apparently I love that♥♥♥♥♥♥because I like just getting on the freeway and going fast. This game has ♥♥♥♥loads of bullet-time. You punch a guy with your gun out? Aim your gun after and you get some bullet-time. Vault over your cover? Aim your gun and guess what? ♥♥♥♥in' bullet-time. Headshot 3 guys before you land, it's awesome.Oh yeah, and you can jump out of your car and onto another car and steal it in motion. That♥♥♥♥♥♥owns, so do that a bunch.The story is ok, I guess. It's serviceable at least. You're an undercover cop in with the triads, and guess what, spoiler alert, you get too close to your gangster buddies and loyalties get conflicted. You're way too good at what you do and kill a billion people so you end up promoted to the top of the organization way too fast. You know, standard stuff. I am pretty curious how you end up getting off scot-free after how many people you've killed. The Hong Kong PD are pretty ♥♥♥♥ing corrupt, I guess. Well they are cops. ACABOh, and if you're a sperglord like me, it puts all the collectibles on the minimap. Thank ♥♥♥♥ing god. For some reason they unlock after you bone down on the various women you encounter throughout the story. I think Wei ♥♥♥♥s just about every woman he encounters. So I guess that's cool, or troubling, maybe. I can't decide. I guess his karaoke powers and street fighting skillz are just enough to overlook the ridiculous clothing he's (probably) wearing.Time to wait for the DLC to go on sale.			",391,120,6,38,23,4,38

												It doesn't offer a great deal that can't be found in other open-world games, but the flipside is that it's also almost entirely free of the guff that drags many of its competitors down. Sleeping Dogs is a lean, refined GTA clone with an emphasis on putting as much of the game at your fingertips as early and often as possible.Gameplay boils down to melee, gunplay and driving sections. Melee fights are the most prevalent part of the game and anyone who's played the Arkham games will feel right at home with the counter-driven one-button fighting here. Melee weapons and environmental kills are offered for some variety but don't add much complexity or depth. Shootouts can be conducted as either an exercise in cover-based pop-and-shoot mechanics (if you're boring), or a more arcadey system where stylish kills can be chained together to rack up continuous bullet time. It's very reminiscent of John Woo's Stranglehold and handily my favourite part of the game, although it errs on the side of being a bit too easy. Driving is fairly standard; cars handle well with the right amount of weight and chases are enlivened somewhat by the presence of that same chained bullet-time mechanic as well as the ability to freely hop from one car to another a la Just Cause.The game's simulated Hong Kong is wonderfully detailed and always lovely to look at, but you'll find that it's not hiding a great deal of interesting content to be discovered. Aside from stores dotted around the place, you'll only ever really find yourself heading from map marker to map marker for story missions or sidequests. The obvious debt the game owes to classic Hong Kong action/martial arts cinema aesthetically will probably make it more interesting to genre fans (like myself).			",328,64,8,35,25,2,52

												Buggy and serious design flaws aside, is Sleeping Dogs fun?  The short answer is yes.  The story is predictable but satisfying -- several characters that I expected to die, did -- with the exception of one.  The fact that the bugs result in ridiculous behaviour only makes the fact that the game plays itself straight all the more hilarious and adding to the entertainmnet value.Cover-combat is nicely broken up with movie-style stunts, favouring bold, aggressive play that is movie-like, entertaining and rewarding both visually and tactically but is otherwise pretty standard.  The Free-Running is perhaps too down-to-earth considering the rest of the game isn't and while a nice attempt is probably one of the weaker game elements.  The fighting has some serious design flaws that really keep it from being as good as it could be; enemy classes weaken what could have been entertaining free-flow combat by giving them uninterruptable attacks or grapple immunity which bogs down the combat flow in a forced way.  The driving seems fine, but the catch-up logic is irritating as it only applies to the computer-controlled cars making racing rely more on luck than it should.  Said driving is not keyboard friendly.Finally, the bugs.  Oh the bugs.  Bugs were the first things I encountered because during the initial chase, the person I was supposed to follow quit running halfway through and in order to continue I had to dash ahead while the game nagged me that I was leaving him behind before he promptly teleported ahead.  Sometimes key events won't fire if you are genre-savvy and plan ahead.  NPC's will get stuck frequently and occasionally have amusing pathfinding difficulties.  One time the security camera wouldn't let me exit.  And the fact that many critical actions are crippled after completing a mission will mean occasionally thugs will steal your car trying to escape you because you couldn't do anything useful until the summary finished summarizing and you dismissed it.Overall  the mechanics work with the general feel, and while fans of GTA or Saints Row will probably prefer those games to this one, it's still fun and its own unique quirks made me feel it was a enjoyable romp.

												Personal GOTY 2012I like this game due to an open world game that actually didnt focus on guns, the melee combat was very fun with so many techniques and the use of environmental damage. Running and jumping across buildings was also fun.The game also holds a leveling system that depends how you complete missions as a cop or a criminal.Unlike GTA4, the story actually kept me interested throughout with a actual likable character.Dont expect too much out of smart AI, radio stations, and city size. Even if these are small things youll be noticing them alot later in the game.Good fun for a game that was released in a year that had nothing to offer			",217,30,4,17,11,1,30

												First Of All, i love this game. There is no faults in it story line and it has a positive flow hrough out the first hour and did not make me bored, thats a first for many games. However it does start to get abit repetative and you start to see alot of props and building ect, used around and about and it starts to look all the same. I do however enjoy the Chinese feel to it and really embracing the calture, its nice to see this in a game.9.5/10Highly recommended for those who love insane Karati skills, Fast cars and bikes and alot of $$$ to customize your character with.Fun game and great to play :DHOME GROWN SPUDS FTW			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fluid, easy to pick up gameplay. Also with  plenty of side missions and mini-games to keep it fresh and fun.			",461,286,7,85,41,7,68

												An excellent game that is in the same vein as GTA, Saint Row, and Mafia, among others. What sets it apart from the pack is the fighting choreography which truly feels like a martial arts cinematic experience. You may get a rush from stealing cars in GTA, or shootouts in Mafia, but in this game, it's the street fights. I've never been to Hong Kong but at least the eastern atmosphere in this game feels as authentic as the movies that inspires it. It's a one of a kind experience.8.5/10			",46,6,1,5,3,0,5

												A mixture of Max Payne and GTA; this game is a must play. The story resembles a classic ""Kung-Fu Action Film"" in which Wei Shen (the protagonist) plays as an undercover cop in Hong Kong, trying to bring down the overwelming Triad force that rules the city. It's chaotic, heartwarming, bloody, and beautiful at the same time. The game is packed with all sorts of missions and side missions, including melee fights, gun fights, training in the Dojo to learn new moves, racing, dating, drug busting, collecting sports cars, chicken fights, photography, car chases, karaoke, going to fight clubs, and more. I should also mention the combat and movement, which is superb. Kung-fu melee combat AND freeroaming with parkour? Phenomenal.All I can say is that if you're looking for a great freeroaming game with a compelling story, or a freeroam that's looking to spice things up a bit; this game is for you. This game does need some fairly decent hardware if you want it to run properly, and I highly recommend getting the HD Texturepack. I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel!Enjoy.

												Let's get the bad out of the way: The driving camera is brutal. It's too close, it doesn't centre/rotate properly when reversing or turning, and just... yeah, it stinks. Also, I'm not a fan of the soundtrack compared to other open-world games. Oh, and the story is not the most original if you watch a lot of HK (or crime) flicks. The game is buggy, too. Finally, the fighting isn't as tight as the Arkham games, and gunplay is only average. Now, for the good -- or should I say stellar. The story, albeit unoriginal, is brought to life by great voice-acting and momentum. Also, I would be remiss to say it's better than the majority of video games. Some movies, shows, and books, too.The fighting does feel cinematic, despite a few rough parts, and the street races get the blood pumping. The city is one of the best I've ever experienced, and the game just oozes atmosphere.It's a must-play game, that can dish out hard-hitting drama but also deliver some laughs, sweetness (or bittersweet feelings), and is loads of fun.I genuinely would have paid for Bethesda-style story DLC, but instead we only received costumes and a few small expansions. Square-Enix have pretty much said they were disappointed by sales (despite ignoring digital numbers) but pump out their derivative JRPG garbage year-in, year-out.Prove 'em wrong by giving this game a shot!

												If you hate GTA as much as I do, yet like the type of the game it is then this one's perfect, in fact, it's better than GTA. Liked the setting, liked the characters, liked the story, liked the theme and overall design of the game, was nice playing in a different culture (a poc protagonist!), not that I know if it's any close to reality or not, but it was a welcome change of environment. Loved melee combat and use of guns, not like ridiculously carrying around a weapon arsenal for a small private army. Throwing umbrellas and grocery bags at people and whacking them with fish = superb xD Enjoyed enviromental kills more than I probably should have. Found myself often concluding, wow, this is really violent, not that it's any defining factor in my view. And pork buns! Why don't you have a pork bun in your hand? You look like you could use a pork bun!Also liked the two dlcs, different kind of ghosts and supernatural, and Wei having to be a plain police officer arresting people who pee in public places, yes. Had to point that out.			",123,102,0,38,20,0,14

												Chinese GTA with a simply awesome combat style. The basic Kung-Fu fighting by mashing buttons on your controller or smacking enemies in garbage containers, it just doesn't get boring beating up the thugs on Hong Kongs streets. The shooting is a little difficult with a controller, but maybe I'm just not used to it. The Slo-Mo elements are really helpful in situations like car chases, to pop the tires of chasing vehicles followed by huge explosions. The story so far is your average undercover cop story you get in any action movie, but not bad at all. There are some nice open-world events and minigames like hacking into CCTV cameras or tracing cellphones. If you have played GTA V by now and start playing Sleeping Dogs afterwards like me, it may be a bit disappointing that there aren't many different character desings for passers or cars. But reminding that this game is already 3 years old, it still looks pretty good. In the end the game has the most important parts an open world game needs and some little extras.

I only wish games like this could offer you the chance to skip action scenes that are too difficult so you can enjoy the story without having to master some skill. Because sometimes the player is not interested in learning how to shot or drive, but in learning how the story will unfold. And this is not a story rich game, but anyway, I'm learning to enjoy action movies, and this game feels exactly like one. ",241,169,4,31,7,0,14

Most people bring up GTA when personally I found this game more comparable to games like Assasins Creed and Arkham City with the heavy focus on melee. It has a unique story that actually fits the world, and feels real. You are a undercover cop with close connections with the Triads, some maybe... too close. But it doesn't do that BS ""choose a side, one or the other."" instead you watch Wei struggle with both, and it's a better game/story because of it. Definitely worth a play-through, although a lot of the DLC you can live without.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The music and fighting mechanisms for the game were also well done, leading to a very enjoyable experience. While there are guns in the game, I loved how the kung fu was done, as by the end of the game, you will feel like a complete badass kungfu master.			",131,17,7,20,12,0,25

												Making aside the zero replayability (maybe for nostalgia factor), it is actually a great game. It feels like Batman Arkham City, but change Batman with an undercover Chinese-American cop... and Arkham City with a beautiful rendition of Hong Kong.It has an amazing story of brotherhood, betrayal.. and the meaning of the word ""home"". Hours of playtime. Definitely worth it!PS: A man who never eats pork buns, it's never a whole man!			",192,44,0,17,26,3,28

												This game is truly amazing, it has an outrageous story mode with many unexpected scenarios. Although, the game didn't last very long, it took me only 3-4 days to finish the game. Other than that, it is a really good game. Basically an Asian version of Grand Theft Auto. Better than Saint rows so far.			",15,1,1,0,1,1,1

												Being a renegade kung-fu fighter, a rogue undercover cop avenging his dead sister, in a well depicted Hong-Kong, is a lot of fun in Sleeping Dogs. Cook a guy's face on hot plates, stab his heart with a swordfish; there are tons of way to kill a poor soul that are way more fun than using guns. The story is pretty good and pretty often, you feel like you're in a movie. When you're not killing triad members or out shopping for new clothes and bracelets, you can do pretty much everything you want: bet on♥♥♥♥♥♥fights, race cars and bikes in the docks, play mahjong...By the end of the game, Wei Shen will be your new definition of a real Badass with sick tats.Also you can sing Take On Me by a-ha, try finding that in a kungfu fighting game!

												Sleeper hit, great game, For an open world sandbox (gta style) game, this has suprisingly deep story that will grip you from beggining to end. Even though it's sandbox, and lets you go free, the game does a great job at directing you and making you ACTUALLY feel like a part of the world, unlike how GTA just makes you feel like a crime spree driven sociopath. Good gameplay, EXCELLENT martial-arts and combat system (that borders on brutal at times with its environmental fatalities), this game is a must play for anyone who likes a good sandbox game, or simply a good undercover cop story.

												♥♥♥♥ all the people who say that SD is a rip-off of GTA. IT IS NOT!It has it's own story, originality and way more advanced playing mechanics than GTA IV. Sure it's less demanding (an even optimized far better than IV).The story tells you about Wei Shen, who is an Chinese-American undercover cop trying to seize the chinese mafia aka Triad. The game is also very intense and gives you a realistic feel in hand-to-hand combat, and in Hong Kong, you don't see people with firearms everyday.			",97,1,0,4,2,0,5

												I love the combat system in the game, it really captures being a streat thug. Most people bring up GTA when personally I found this game more comparable to games like Assasins Creed and Arkham City with the heavy focus on melee. It has a unique story that actually fits the world, and feels real. You are a undercover cop with close connections with the Triads, some maybe... too close. But it doesn't do that BS ""choose a side, one or the other."" instead you watch Wei struggle with both, and it's a better game/story because of it. Definitely worth a play-through, although a lot of the DLC you can live without.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Maybe I comment later.I'm not a fan of action games, but I did enjoy playing this one. I only wish games like this could offer you the chance to skip action scenes that are too difficult so you can enjoy the story without having to master some skill. Because sometimes the player is not interested in learning how to shot or drive, but in learning how the story will unfold. And this is not a story rich game, but anyway, I'm learning to enjoy action movies, and this game feels exactly like one. ",241,169,4,31,7,0,14

												Sleeping Dogs is the only open world free roaming game I've finished so far.Perhaps I am Asian and have never really liked the GTA series. And I've always wanted to be an undercover cop working for the triads after watching multiple 90s cops & triads movies that Hong Kong is famous for.IMO its the way the quests are structured that made me want to continue. The characters call/message you before you click on the accept quest icon, making the world feel rather real. It makes you feel needed by the characters. Thus the quests flow smoothly. As I stated above, the storyline intrigued me and I felt attached to Wei Shen, the undercover officer, wanting to find out if he survives.I've got the game at 50% off, finished the game and felt satisfied with it. I highly recommend it.			",212,25,0,45,11,1,24

												The main storyline follows an emerging gang war that threatens to overrun the city of Hong Kong. You then follow a series of fairly redundant missions before beginning to shake down local vendors for money and beating up enemy gangs to bolster Winston's ego. Occasionally meeting up with your police handler, to hear the same lecture about not getting too emotionally involved to the monsters you’re working for.I have to be blunt, aside from the really pretty graphics, the game takes a face dive into the floor for it's combat system being nearly non-existent. You can pretty much just sit there deflecting attacks till your enemy just spontaneously dies, since the actual combat is a bit meh by having it just be a combo of clicks. This wasn't suppose to be a point-and-click game, yet the combat system makes it feel like one. So with 80% of the game revolving around combat, it's a real let down there.Another complaint I have to make is basically how terrible the handling of any vehicle was. There is virtually no chance of speeding and driving properly what-so-ever, as someone who has grown up playing various race games, this is another disappointing factor of the game.The game’s second biggest issue is with its camera. It can often positions itself towards center even when you’re trying to maneuver whilst driving. This can significantly complicate navigating tight quarters or getting a look around your vehicle in open spaces. The camera can also be frustrating in some combat situations, though it doesn't happen quite as often or severely.I also have to point out that in a gang game, it is virtually impossible to actually acquire a weapon. For memory you get a gun once during the entire game for approximately 5 minutes and nothing more. Knives are also irritatingly rare with maybe only one person in a random gang you attack to have one which you can sometimes have the option of picking up.It redeems itself within it's story-line, but, character development, bar the ones in cut scenes seem so cut short and abnormal. You go from just meeting a person to seeming like you have been in a relationship for years. It just doesn't quite flow in my opinion.All that aside, I did enjoy the random health shrines, deterring from the usual 'Pick up a health pot to gain more max health', within combat you can't just go to the side and chew on regenerative dirt, it takes a bit more time to actually gain it back. Another really redeeming quality is the animations to fight scenes, they are quite realistic. Also, the sounds of punching and slashing (when you finally acquire a knife) are brilliant.Moving on.. People chattering away in the background, or random vendors trying to sell certain things to which you can also interact with a few odd ones here and there make it feel a lot more in-depth and was something I did enjoy. Also actually just having pedestrians is such a tiny detail that make a game feel so much more real. It pulls it off with flying colors. I also have to make a comment on the voice acting. It simply adds to this emphasis on realism. The game employs a unique mixture of Chinese and English that doesn't sound corny or ill-executed which can be pretty difficult to pull off.In all, pretty good game, just a few frustrating little downfalls.

Everything from the flow of the martial arts combat, to the driving, to the sense of humour, and the intricate recreation of Hong Kong that you can explore.

												Okay seriously stop what you're doing and ask yourself why you don't have this game yet. I expected some fun Chinese crime/Triad shoot'em'up. What I got was a LOT more. Most likeable protagonist I've seen in forever, a gripping story, a great variety of unique, interesting and likeable (or hateable) characters, fun gameplay, and better writing than anything I've seen in this genre to date. If you liked Saints Row, the first and second in particular, give this a try. You won't be disappointed. Have I mentioned this game is ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous (and Wei is, too)?			",212,122,4,59,41,0,30

Posted: March 3, 2014
												A friend got me this game saying it was rather decent. The sale was on and well i decided to say yes, from what i had seen, the game didn't look to bad, looked fun but also looked a little boring, which left me a little unwanting to play it. The steam sale was on when my friend got it me, so i had all of the DLC along with the game, which being honest, is a lot, from two extra DLC missions which add on, to ones which add to your triad and police level, to cars and clothes. There's plenty given from this to help gain your interest within the game. So, from that being said, lets start from the beginning. From my own slight worries and fears for the game, the opening looked promising, controls are standard and decent but felt a little clunky at first, i played more and got past the opening. The story showed it's inital idea and the concept was rather interesting but was... slow to really push this idea until much later on in the game.Once the story had been laid out and i had done the starting missions i found myself sitting there for 15 minuets as it showed me all of the DLC, what it had given me, and all the bonuses.. Which is great and all.. But it meant that my Triad and police levels shot to level 8, same with face meter, meaning by a quater way in i was max leveled on triad and police. It meant i could do more fun earlier on, but made the game a little ""to"" easy as it clearly laid out missions with mind off you gradually gaining upgrades, but, it was still fun to be kicking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of enemies from the start and feeling like a Kung Fu master.After a few hours into the game the story had been slow. Wasn't gaining my interest and the side missions were fun up to a certain amount of time, even with all the extra content given out to me. So, i ended up leaving this on the side, in my libary for a time. I eventually came back after a few weeks and decided to have another go, i had an issue with the game crashing, easily fixed by validating the files but still was a pain. I opened my save and didn't remember anything, nothing suck in or stuck with me for the weeks, but, determined from reviews and some walkthroughs i started another new game and worked my way up to the place i was. But this time, i found myself more involved into the story when i started to understand the situation the player is in, what you're doing, and why the story is so evidently slow from the go. I managed to start to work my way through and found myself becoming more and more engrossed into the storyline, but not just that, i found myself starting to have conflict between being a traid and being an undercover police officer, something, that isn't easy to do, question a player: Are you a traid? Or are you still an officer? Especially when you can just run down people without stress, kill police officers, break speeding limits and more. Depending on this it kinda made me think well where do i go. I moved into the police cases aspect to the game then. The cases are a welcome additon, technically, a side mission spanning through the game the police cases are truly interesting and allow for you to keep to your roots as an officer while being drawn more and more into the crazy, murdering world of the traids. The missions slowly unlock as you play through the main missions, all cases being diverse into what you look into and some even being rather shocking from the final result. But in the end, you still feel like you've made an achievement into solving them and trying to stick to being a cop. Especially when you go from missions stealing/Killing and all this, to doing something for the better.From being more into the game now i took a look at the aspects of gameplay. Fighting was solid, guns felt powerful and fun to use and even driving on a keyboard and mouse was very enjoyable and responsive. Fighting is similar to that of Batman: Arkham series where you hit people with combos and then counter attacks as they start to come in landing on you. Despite feeling like a kung-fu god, going more and more in lead me to being killed and defeated easily by larger eneimes and more in groups. So i explored, found health shrines to take more hits, and went and found the statues to learn more moves as well, it made it interesting but, the statues are all generally in the way in missions, making searching for them kinda irrelivent, it's almost like they put them in the way in missions so you pick them up anyway and learn the moves, not like you have to go looking to truly gain an upper hand, just a way of slowly keeping your fighting up to par with the rest. Despite that, it was still very, very fun and the fighting never really got repetative when you're breaking someones leg and then flying kicking someone else in the head.So i had gotten later in. SPOILER  To the point where Wei had become a red pole, moving up the ranks, working for uncle Poe and managing to learn more about the higher ranks of the triads  And i found myself being more and more drawn in, especially to the traid side, beggining more to forget about my police side and loose myself in order to gain more into the traids. It was around here i found that sleeping dogs wasn't afraid to deal with much more horrid situations. The game had been very tame, not a lot of blood, some decent fighting but nothing counting as shocking.Until... The wedding...  Boy, did the game soon show me is was taking it more seriously, and was not afraid to show much more graphical violence, showing me the world of which i was trying to get into. It showed the horror of what can happen inside of this world and the danger i was in.  Especially when you see Wei in a blood stained suit, trying to comfort a dying Winston  It showed me it was prepared to shock me and show me more of the horrors of the world, making it show, sleeping dogs was able to remain serious and deal with these situations in a decent way. Past that the game toned down a little but the story, REALLY, picked up for me. It moved up more and more, making it even more interesting and getting me even more into it, so much so, i found myself playing it late at night as the battle between being with the triads and being a police officer forever was nagging there, and was clearly showing for Wei as well. Much later in and near the end a lot happened, a lot had to be taken in, the game had built up this tension that just.... fell short. The ending felt like all this tension and hard work into getting me to think of either being a triad or police just wasn't brought to a full conclusion. For those who have finished.  The ending felt like you either kill big Smile Lee as either an officer of the law, or as revenge for him killing your triad friends . For those who haven't, the ending only makes you feel like you've done it for one side or the other... and nothing else than that, which was a damn shame to all that hard work going into it. Regardless, it was still fun and enjoyable. Before the ending there is also another bloody scene, which i warn, those who cannot stand blood or worse, look away when it happens, and trust me, you know when it will. Overall sleeping dogs truly got me into it, got me to battle how i felt with being an undercover cop and got me to see the grousome side of everything which happened and could happen in such a game. I look forward to the DLC and would recommend this to anyone. It is slow to get into, but damn fun and interesting once you do get into it. I would say buy with all the DLC as well, as it's more worth it that way, but either way, sleeping dogs is a damn good game and i would rate it 9/10 from everything i've played. Just make sure that during some scenes you're prepared, as much as the game seems a little goofy, it handles some truly horrifying moments seriously and well.			",171,22,1,16,13,3,5

												Great game. There are so many things to do from racing cars and randomly doing Bruce Lee karate moves on innocent citizens. The game is set in Hong Kong and for that reason I feel like Inspector Lee from the Rush Hour movies. The game is more focused on hand to hand combat, I thought it would have been terrible because I like to shoot things. But for some reason its much more satisfying to throw karate moves instead of bullets. So much action great story. BUY IT!			",97,10,3,11,8,0,19

I played most of the game with the controller and a few hours without, the default key binding with the keyboard/mouse are kind of messed up.GO PLAY! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs is a masterpiece of open world game play, bringing many different game mechanics flawlessly into one.Character development is amazing and very likable, with many twists and turns right throughout the main storyline. The voice acting is arguably the best I've seen in games of recent, you get attached to the dialogue and the mood of some scenes is somewhat of a movie rather than a game. Combat is top notch with the kung fu fights, which you can progress even further with Wei Shen unlocking new melee skills. Gun play is also very good, not being too overly emphasised as much as melee, which is better in some way, as the melee is one of the games selling points. Being open world you are given the freedom of Hong Kong. There is always something to do while you explore the streets, from random evens which can pop up at any corner which challenge you in different scenarios to finding many hidden lock boxes scattered around. This makes the game refreshing and can give you some surprises. With a myriad of game mechanics and a story that really grips you, this rightfully gets a 9/10.			",52,4,1,5,1,0,3

												This game is by farm the best open world crime game I have ever played. Grand theft auto and saints row sagas are repetitive and normal to the genre, the hong kong setting, the story-line, the different stuff you can do, it leaves u screaming for more. The fighting gameplay is immersive and real. The story line is incredible and feels like an hong kong movie. And the graphic style is stunning. The hong kong bright lights and colours (and chop-shops) are the perfect place to set a game like this and it brings a twist to the normal grey of the LA or detroit scene. Amazing game well worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs was both a fun game, and a fulfilling open world experience. The story was interesting and had depth, gameplay never felt repetitive as the game progressed. Graphics were good minus a few texture glitches/lighting errors. Combat was complex and diverse while retaining simplicity. Player animations were great in number, and allowed for great mobility while parkouring around the map. The world was detailed and immersive. It's easy to get enveloped in the this digital replication of Hong Kong, as the details allowed it to feel very authentic. Voice acting was mostly in English with a little Chinese added, making it both intelligible and authentic.As for negatives, they are few, but they will annoy the sh!t out of you. Bugs were not uncommon, glitchy textures/animations, AI wasn't the best, and map pathing was awful at times. Customizability for vehicles left plenty to be desired. Despite any negatives, this was a good game and definitely recommended. 8/10			",56,11,1,14,6,0,2

												I love this game a Hong Kong Based Open World adventure like GTA. But your a policeman undercover so a little less killing a lot of kung fu and training. A ton of other cool missions and a bunch of hidden lockboxes,statues and prayer zones the more you find the more your health score maxes out.This game reminds me of the original Shenmue series that was on Sega Dreamcast many years ago and the newer Yakuza franchise that was out on PS3. I have played for 20 hours around and have about 20 percent done. But if your friends have the game see how long you can drive at full speed and not hit anything to break your friends record or knock down parking meters and collect money and see if you can beat your friend at that. Many things going on in the game. You actually level up as police and as the gang triad which both give you different new abilities. I would give the game 5 out of 5 stars if their was a rating system!			",213,117,16,9,11,5,18

												I never thought I'd get into a game so much as I have with this.Gameplay comes across as a cross between Assassin's Creed, GTA and Batman combat-wise. Not so fluid movements, but satisfying results. you rely on your bullets in this game, when you find a gun, so use them wisely.Storyline, however, is fantastic. Even if you don't like the gameplay, I seriously reccomend playing it through for the story. The ways that the characters develop is just fascinating and you find yourself wanting to know more. The only thing I wish we could've seen more of is Wei Shen's history. Maybe a future DLC? Side missions are fun to play, but not necessary unless you want to upgrade your ""face"" which is where you can wear certain clothes and buy certain cars to give you certain perks in the game. Fun, but not necessary. I've only just started on the DLC's so not much to say on them so far.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its meant to be kind of like the older games in the true crimes series and it is but it also improves on them and adds more of an rpg element to it. The only thing i did not like was the fact that getting a gun in this game is hard as it is removed not long after a mission. But thats not a game breaker at all as the shooting elements in this game are far and few in between. So it is not a shooter like the first two are. But still a must buy and a must play.

He grabs me with his powerful hands and puts me down onto my hands and knees I'm ready I spread my budget for Him He penetrates my wallet and my very soul It hurts so much but I do it for Him I can feel my HK dollars dissapearing as my mouth starts to water I push against his force I want to please Him He roars in a mighty roar as he fills my hands with his pork buns My dad walks in Pork Bun Man looks him straight in the eyes and says, ""Why don't you have a pork bun in your hand?"" He leaves through my window Pork Bun Man is love. Pork Bun Man is life.			",82,7,1,6,5,0,0

												Loved this game. It seems that it is relatively underated, but it is definitely a must-play in my opinion. Pros-Gorgeous visuals-Fully realized world-Very fun combat-Great voice acting-Compelling storyCons-Vehicle handling could use some work-Vehicle models are not as visually attractive, though they are still decent-Some inconsistencies exist: our protagonist is a ""good"" cop, but there are plenty of oppurtunities that make him a bad cop. Also, The story leads you to feel like you are turning in to a gangster, and leaving behind your cop mindset, yet this is not correct, you are a cop through-and-through. -The girlfriend part of the game is stupid and pointless. They aren't necessary, and they feel out of place. The protagonist is supposedly good and perhaps even a practioner of chivalry, yet you have the option to be a ""player"" and date multiple girls. I did not participate in this portion of the game, as it's out-of-place and out-of-character.This game is totally worth playing. It's not perfect by any means, and I wouldn't even compare it to GTA; it is a different playstyle, whereas GTA is a free-for-all satirical look at society, Sleeping Dogs is a cinematic take on Chinese gang-cop mentality, and it will really make you feel like you're in the mix of it.

												This is such a nice game, even better than GTA (still haven't played GTA V yet). Especially combat experience is one of the best you can get from a sandbox game.         Storyline may not be mindblowing though it is quite enjoyable and addictive. Although they could have add more features to make the game more realistic, like buying houses and spending money on market. Driving cars and especially bikes around the city is so fun and jumping out from a car or a bike to get in another vehicle is amazing.          I bought the game with all DLCs during the %80 sale and some of them may reduce the challange of gameplay, however I have enjoyed the game with those boosts. You may not want them while playing but even if you have them you can disable, just read the thread about it on forums.         All in all this is a great game, which you can enjoy during your free time while relaxing and driving around the streets of Hong-Kong... Hope you will like the game just as I do... I will give 8.5/10.			",133,54,4,17,24,4,34

												If you are a fan of Jackie Chan's a 'New Police Story' or any of the old fashioned Chinese police movies for that matter; this is definitely the game for you. It captures the vibrancy and hustle of Hong Kong with beautiful graphics and clever AI that makes the city feel real, gritty and busy; something I have rarely seen a game accomplish so well. The driving is well balanced as are the fighting and shooting mechanics; none of which ever felt repetitive or overpowered during my 42 hour play-through. The main Character Shen had an interesting story to tell and I feel Square Enix did well in development as I found him an engaging protagonist that walked the frequent line of oblivion.In short, I highly recommend picking up this game if you want to play something a little different to the norm. It is fun, immersive and captures the heart of China even if the ending is a shameless setup for the next game.8/10			",132,22,1,15,5,2,9

												This is probably one of the best games I've ever played. It perfectly captures much of Hong Kong culture in a way that makes sense to a wide audience but is not diluted to a Chinese audience. Action is good, fast and exciting, but at times the game feels unpolished and glitchy. It reminds me a lot of GTA3 or Saints Row, a really good first try, but with tons of room for improvement. Excellent story, reminiscent of many Hong Kong undercover police dramas and movies. Well worth trying out. Also the subtitles are not quite perfect, but once again reminiscent of the movies that must have influenced it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a 3rd person GTA style game with martial arts combat thrown into the mix. The story takes place in Hong Kong and has a strong Asian theme throughout the game, triad gangs with their codes and beliefs, art style, cars, martial arts and lots of food.You play as a undercover police officer, and a former triad member returning back from USA to Hong Kong, China. Game story evolves mostly around police, you and triads, their constant battle for power. There are lots of side activities, in form of racing, helping people with problems, busting drug deals, stealing vehicles, assassination's, random dating, etc.There are a lot of collectibles in game, some give you cash, some unlock clothes, melee moves and vehicles, others boost your health. Game plays like any GTA style game, but with some added elements. You can steal and drive cars, bikes, boats (no aircraft), you can shoot firearms, use melee weapons.A lot of killing in the game is done through martial arts melee combat. You unlock moves, perks, abilities by spending points acquired by doing missions and collecting certain collectibles. I really enjoyed the story, it has many twists and unexpected moments.Game looks and plays well, there are some low resolution textures here and there, even with high texture DLC pack. Character animations, control was good and easy to use. I really liked voice acting, it didn't have that cheap feel you get in other games where Asian characters are voiced with fake accents. There are some elements of gore in game, that may be unpleasant and not advised for those of under age.			",228,36,5,24,35,0,27

												The story was a amazing and kept me playing the game non-stop until the final climatic mission. All characters are very well made with great voice acting. When it comes to gameplay, I'm not sure about mouse and keyboard since I played purely by controller, but it was fun and the combat was very responsive. The melee combat system is very deep compared to most other games in the genre with its great combos and counter-attacks as well as skill trees but it also features cover-based shooting for all you GTA fans. Driving is alright, but the camera angles at times can be annoying. The game could use a multiplayer mode for racing and free-roam as well. Overall, a great game by any means. Buy it. 8/10			",101,12,0,11,7,0,2

												Buggy and serious design flaws aside, is Sleeping Dogs fun?  The short answer is yes.  The story is predictable but satisfying -- several characters that I expected to die, did -- with the exception of one.  The fact that the bugs result in ridiculous behaviour only makes the fact that the game plays itself straight all the more hilarious and adding to the entertainmnet value.Cover-combat is nicely broken up with movie-style stunts, favouring bold, aggressive play that is movie-like, entertaining and rewarding both visually and tactically but is otherwise pretty standard.  The Free-Running is perhaps too down-to-earth considering the rest of the game isn't and while a nice attempt is probably one of the weaker game elements.  The fighting has some serious design flaws that really keep it from being as good as it could be; enemy classes weaken what could have been entertaining free-flow combat by giving them uninterruptable attacks or grapple immunity which bogs down the combat flow in a forced way.  The driving seems fine, but the catch-up logic is irritating as it only applies to the computer-controlled cars making racing rely more on luck than it should.  Said driving is not keyboard friendly.Finally, the bugs.  Oh the bugs.  Bugs were the first things I encountered because during the initial chase, the person I was supposed to follow quit running halfway through and in order to continue I had to dash ahead while the game nagged me that I was leaving him behind before he promptly teleported ahead.  Sometimes key events won't fire if you are genre-savvy and plan ahead.  NPC's will get stuck frequently and occasionally have amusing pathfinding difficulties.  One time the security camera wouldn't let me exit.  And the fact that many critical actions are crippled after completing a mission will mean occasionally thugs will steal your car trying to escape you because you couldn't do anything useful until the summary finished summarizing and you dismissed it.Overall  the mechanics work with the general feel, and while fans of GTA or Saints Row will probably prefer those games to this one, it's still fun and its own unique quirks made me feel it was a enjoyable romp.

												It's hard to believe this started out as a True Crime title. It's a great undercover cop action game set in Hong Kong. The driving is arcade-y, the fighting is styled after the Batman: Arkham games except with more kung fu, and the shooting is at least as competent as any other open world game. If you liked Saints Row the Third but want something a little more grounded in reality, Sleeping Dogs is a good fit.			",772,173,11,91,53,5,124

												Dear Reader,Sleeping Dogs is a spectactular game. With a lovely story where everyone is happy and they gets what they want, it makes for a truely realistic experience of what it is like being a man living in Hong Kong. In Sleeping Dogs, there is no violence or drama, but it makes up for that with lots of heartfelt, family-friendly humor. I have personally put almost 24 hours worth of my time into this game, and I do intend to put more. So, if you do get bored with your mindless slaughter of innocent NPC's, purchase and enjoy Sleeping Dogs today.Love,Fossor_			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Profoundly ripping off GTA, but still a great game. The story is actually not all that bad and plays with ambiguity and morality well. The graphics are astounding and the open-world fun to explore. The biggest issue is the challenge, after you get the hang of the controls, you'll never lose a fight, never lose a gun battle. Would be nice if you could aggro more mobs or something to build the challenge, but no. Anyway, for less than $10 this is a great 50+ hours of story.			",46,10,0,5,1,1,12

I normally get somewhat paralyzed by choice overload in these open world games, but the story in this is actually really involving, so there's always reason to keep progressing it.   There's a lot to like here, especially if you appreciate the subtle details about how as the game progresses and you are forced to go further and further past the line of the law, your actions start to reflect that.

												In this quirky 3D adventure from United Front Games and Square Enix, players take control of one of 20 different types of dogs and basically do what dogs do. The list of actions includes begging for food, sniffing, digging, chasing, barking, fetching sticks, and of course, farting and leaving organic mines. If you switch into first-person view, ""smell-o-vision"" lets you see all of the vital information visually on the screen -- In black and white of course.

												Holy Jesus this game was so much fun. I just finished the story, and it was fantastic. I would compare the feeling I'm having right now to a roller coaster. The game was non-stop fun througout the whole game, and now I have this sudden calmness. The story was THAT great, but there was one thing I loved about it. It never bored me. I could go one mission to the next without wanting to do something else. In fact, I found the story so interesting that I have almost every secondary mission to do now that the game is over. The combat in this game is spectacular is almost exactly like Batman. The combos and way you learn them are almost identical to the game Bully however, which I noticed immediately. The driving is good for an open-world game, and smashing through everything that gets in your way is a blast. This game has been on my backlog for a while now and I highly regret it. This is the most fun I've had in a game in months. As an open-world game, I enjoyed it even more than GTA 4. 10/10.			",152,13,4,27,13,3,9

Voice acting is top notch, even from non-traditional voice actors (Screen actors include Lucy Liu among others) Controls are a little more arcadey than normal, but it fits right into the tone of the game. Lots of hidden things and objectives like street racing, both cop and triad missions, as well as decent dlc. 86% approval.Pros: -Voice ActingSolid CombatCons:-Driving controls/Mechanics could use tightening.

												Wei Shen is the protagonist to the game Sleeping Dog ( Note there are no dogs in this game and don't you dare make asian joke about eating dogs ) who is the most ruthless asian I have even played as.

I kid you not ( In the DLC The Wheels of Fury Pack  ) ), impaling people on swordfish heads and hanging hooks ( In a fish market )  or shoving them into a ice chipper ( and listen to them scream in agony). If any of the following things interest you then I highly recommend you get Sleeping Dogs and murder those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ asian cops and 18K members ( Rival Gang ) to your hearts content. Actually if you hate asians you might as well buy this game as its basically a asian murdering simulator. Now go forth my friend and commit genocide you racist jackass.

												This is one of the better ""free roam the city in a car and kill some dudes now and then"" games I've played. There's a newer, crappier version of it out now that you're expected to purchase instead that ""improves"" the graphics and makes the game a sloppy buggy mess.This original release is smooth, pretty, and I experienced no issues in my time with it. XBOX controller support is perfect so no worries there. The hand to hand combat is copied and pasted from the Batman Arkham series and is fun and fulfilling. Occasionally you'll get a gun with limited ammo, the story established reasoning behind this is even for cops firearms are very limited in Hong Kong. They appear often enough to keep you satiated anyway.The story is deep and interesting, and makes you care about the player character and his companions. I won't get too into it cuz go play the game but you're an undercover cop infiltrating the gangs that have taken over your home town.I'd play this over GTA V any day.			",504,73,6,33,20,3,35

												A GTA lookalike open world sandbox playing in Hong Kong with extremely nice and fluid visuals and the best in class combat system.Golden bits:First and foremost the combat system. This is absolutely the best in the game and the best combat I ever had the chance of playing in a game that is not purely a combat game. Or maybe even including those. Combat is super fluid and adapts wonderfully to the situation while not featuring ridiculously complicated controller button combos.The abundance of good looking chicks. I mean this game features an extremely high percentage of 10/10 females wandering the streets of this city.  Mrs. Chu without a doubt. One cannot not like her to the point handling of the butcher knife. Your apartment in Central. Great shed - too bad the toilet seems to be always full of some yellow substance.Stinky bits:FOW inside apartments. While the FOW is OK during the action sequences in the city it gets terribly narrow inside apartments. Instant vomit.Racing sequences. There are 18 of these and strictly not fun. I am not saying they are difficult they are just the worst executed bits of an otherwise great game. Vehicle damage modelling. Sucks. Cars take a stupidly large amount of punishment before they explode.The 2 DLCs with achievements. They are extremely dragged out and boring. They also take away some of the skills you already got in the main game which is mad. I suggest playing the DLCs before finishing the main game in case you would wanna go for a 100% completion - otherwise they would feel very much like a bad afterthought.Stat award achievements. It is not nice having got to grind these after finishing the game. Not nice at all.All in all it is still very much Recommended. (8/10)			",118,49,1,39,14,3,37

												Made by: United Front Games and Square EnixGenre: Third-person shooter, open world, RPGish, action-adventure, combat.Themes: Undercover drama and the fight betwen good and evill.Story: You are Wei Shen: a undercover cop. Your goal is to take out the Hong Kong triad family called ""The Sun On Yee"". In the beginning of the game, Wei gets caught during a drug deal that back fired. Wei gets sent to jail, in jail he finds a childhood friend named Jackie, who works for the Son On Yee. Thanks to Jackie you're now part of Winston's group. Winston is a Son On Yee ""red pole"" (local leader) and a leader of the Water Street Gang. From that point on you must make your way up to the top of the triad family to take it down.Gameplay: The game has an interesting focus on melee combat instead of the usual focus on gunplay. You will find yourself using your fist's more so than guns, because guns are relatively hard to get by in the streets of Hong Kong. The combat of this game is not hard only because your combos consist of spamming one button and then the occasional hold of sed button to perform a special effect like: stun, knock down or just a heavy hit. The gunplay (when you find a gun) is fun.The game has a well implemented cover mechanic. When youre behind cover you can blind fire or vault over your cover to slow down time and enter bullet time for a short period of time. Bullet time in this game is nothing like the bullet time in Max Payne, every time you get a kill it extends the time you spend in bullet time. You can literally clean up a area in Hong Kong by just shoting the living hell out of every one while in bullet time!!!(WARNING: You still need to reload, bullet time or no bullet time clips still exist.) There are two tipes of guns in this game: pistols and two handed guns. The difrence is that you can carry around a pistol, but you cant carry around any thing thats not a pistol, (Smg's, shotguns, rifles etc.) you will be forced to drop those guns when entering vehicles.The game also has some RPG elements: every time you finish a mission you get ""Cop points"" and ""Triad points"", you can use sed points to upgrade Wei's damage and resistibility to bullets, and melee damage using the triad and cop skill trees. You get cop points for doing the mission as flawless as you can. You lose cop points for doing illegal stuff like property damage, murdering innocent people etc. You get triad points for killing triads, using combos, environmental kills, or just shanking them with a knife. :p(NOTE: Only after finishing a mission you will get sed points, killing innocent civilians is still ok as long as you kill them not during a mission.)The driving is fun, it has that arcade feel of driving. While driving you can use the ram button (Yes a ram button. Problem?) to fight off enemies while driving, you can also enter bullet time if you have a pistol in your holster.The game has parkour. Though it's used for some chaise scenes and sometimes its needed to get a collectible, and that's it, you don't really use it all that much....Problems: The game ads a lot of mechanics but it doesn't try to experiment or give those mechanics a better use. The parkour is used sometimes, stealth is there when the story needs stealth and the game has boats that are only used to get to the poker mini-game!!!!Final thoughts: If you like GTA style games, but you want less gunplay, this game is right up your alley. The game is fun and filled with collectibles that reward you for collecting them, like giving you money or health upgrades. You will enjoy every minute spent in Hong Kong.			",155,7,3,3,2,2,7

												Sleeping Dogs is a gem by Square Enix.  It has all of the elements needed for a great action/drama game with fighting, driving/racing and FPS elements.  The gameplay is extemely fun and intuitive.  The storyline is very engaging with complex characters and A-list voice acting (by a few well know movie actors nonetheless).  Be sure to use the high-resloution DLC (free on Steam).  For me, it was better to use a controller for the driving and fighting aspects alone.  This game also supports wide-screen resolutions.  I am very glad to have experienced this title and applaud Square Enix on thier continued line of quality games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It starts out incredibly bad, but ends up being breezy, gorgeous, arcadey, and varied.  Feels like every Rockstar game stapled together under the neon lights of Hong Kong,  Snag the free hi-res texture pack (separate DLC) for best results.  The next generation of gamers isn't going to associate Square-Enix with RPGs; they're going to associate them with hella rad open world action games like this and Just Cause 2.

												I was only 9 years old I loved pork buns so much, I ate all the meat and doughy goodness I pray to Pork Bun Man every night before bed, thanking him for the pork bun in my hand. ""Man who never eat pork bun,"" I say, ""is never a whole man."" My dad hears me and admits I am a failure I know he was just jealous of my devotion for Pork Pun Man I remind him he will never be a whole man He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep I'm crying now, and my face hurts I lay in bed and it's really cold Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me It's Him I am so happy He whispers into my ear ""You look like you could use a pork bun."" He grabs me with his powerful hands and puts me down onto my hands and knees I'm ready I spread my budget for Him He penetrates my wallet and my very soul It hurts so much but I do it for Him I can feel my HK dollars dissapearing as my mouth starts to water I push against his force I want to please Him He roars in a mighty roar as he fills my hands with his pork buns My dad walks in Pork Bun Man looks him straight in the eyes and says, ""Why don't you have a pork bun in your hand?"" He leaves through my window Pork Bun Man is love. Pork Bun Man is life.			",82,7,1,6,5,0,0

												Ridiculously fun, actually doesn't push for the run'n'gun method; you wanna fight? you do it with your fists along with the impressive combo system.  Unfortunately for me, I purchased the deluxe edition so its been made really easy for me but even without the extra help it's still fun and rewarding to progress in the story and even side missions as you play both sides of the law. The story is pretty awesome; reminiscent of those classic Hong Kong crime films which usually play around with deceit and hardcore law and corrupt officers. It's an enjoyable game for different reasons as opposed to Grand Theft Auto (which many wrote off this game to be an exact clone of, it's not). I'm really glad Square Enix picked this game up after it was dropped and almost wasn't even released to the public.			",323,82,7,59,12,2,25

												Sleeping Dogs is GTA 4 with parkour and good combat and bullet-time. That's it really. It's GTA 4 mashed up with Hong Kong cinema. It's pretty glorious. The combat in this game is really just a simplified Arkham Asylum, which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good for a GTA clone, considering how wrong they always get it. You've got pretty simple X, X, X, hold X combos, with different amount of X's pre-hold giving you different sweet combos. You've got a grapple that you can follow up with arm-breaking, tossing them off a ledge, or just, you know, bashin' their face in. You have all sorts of sweet kicks. It's pretty martial-artsy of course but it's less trying to look cool (although it does) and more about no nonsense killing dudes with your body. Also you can grab people and throw them in dumpsters or impale them on meat hooks or smash them into a box full of broken glass (yeah I don't know why there are boxes full of broken glass everywhere.) The driving feels good, but I can't remember how driving felt in GTA 4. It probably apes that as well so if you're one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who couldn't deal with that you'll probably hate it. But you can hang out of your car window and shoot out tires and♥♥♥♥♥♥and when you start shooting the game goes into slow motion so you can actually do it without crashing into a wall, which is cool. This is a pretty spergy thing, but I really like the freeway system in this game. It loops around the whole city with lots of nice on-ramps and exchanges everywhere and apparently I love that♥♥♥♥♥♥because I like just getting on the freeway and going fast. This game has ♥♥♥♥loads of bullet-time. You punch a guy with your gun out? Aim your gun after and you get some bullet-time. Vault over your cover? Aim your gun and guess what? ♥♥♥♥in' bullet-time. Headshot 3 guys before you land, it's awesome.Oh yeah, and you can jump out of your car and onto another car and steal it in motion. That♥♥♥♥♥♥owns, so do that a bunch.The story is ok, I guess. It's serviceable at least. You're an undercover cop in with the triads, and guess what, spoiler alert, you get too close to your gangster buddies and loyalties get conflicted. You're way too good at what you do and kill a billion people so you end up promoted to the top of the organization way too fast. You know, standard stuff. I am pretty curious how you end up getting off scot-free after how many people you've killed. The Hong Kong PD are pretty ♥♥♥♥ing corrupt, I guess. Well they are cops. ACABOh, and if you're a sperglord like me, it puts all the collectibles on the minimap. Thank ♥♥♥♥ing god. For some reason they unlock after you bone down on the various women you encounter throughout the story. I think Wei ♥♥♥♥s just about every woman he encounters. So I guess that's cool, or troubling, maybe. I can't decide. I guess his karaoke powers and street fighting skillz are just enough to overlook the ridiculous clothing he's (probably) wearing.Time to wait for the DLC to go on sale.			",391,120,6,38,23,4,38

												I haven't had as much fun with an open world game since GTA 3. Sleeping dogs had me invested from the first moment to the last. Everything about the game is well executed, from the fighting, to the driving, to the cover based shooting, it's all very well executed. The thing that really got me though is the characters, from the main character, Wei, to any of the other various characters I was impressed. The story is very well told and helps add depth to, Wei, as he goes deeper undercover. I came in alittle late on getting it, but I'm so glad I got this game! To sum it up, it's nothing short of amazing and deserves to be in everyone's library. It also had a butt load of DLC, all worth the investment. So of you haven't played sleeping dogs, go do so now! 10/10			",55,2,1,7,8,2,8

												An enjoyable take on the GTA formula, don't expect anything new but what is done is done fairly well. A collection of GTA type mission structures and driving mixed in with the melee systems of Batman, Remember Me and inFAMOUS, you won't find a lot of gunplay but the martial arts style does work and carries the game fairly well, although at some points I found it got bit tedious. The story won't win any awards and relies on a lot of tropes but it's paced well enough to keep you going.Sleeping Dogs is an enjoyable enough game, it's biggest problem being that it doesnt really offer anything innovative, relying on its setting more than anything to be its point of difference. With GTA V it looks somewhat dated but it's still worth checking out if you're into the genre, just don't expect any revelations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs captures the atmosphere of Hong Kong and throws you into the life of Wei Shen, undercover cop-extraordinaire. Through the 30 story missions, you grow fond of the characters and the visceral life of the triads. The fight mechanics are wonderful once you get a hang of it (play defensively) though the collectibles are very much a grind. Cantonese speakers will find this to be a diamond in the rough with its not-so-subtle use of profanity and cultural mannerisms. On the surface, however, those who are unfamiliar with Hong Kong might perceive this as an exaggerated dose of stereotypes. This is definitely an under-appreciated game that is worth a look!

												A stunning display of what can be done on the PC if the developer pours their heart into it, Stunning graphics, a great story, amazing voice-acting, all set in the gritty world of the Triads in Hong-Kong. The fighting engine is something to get used to, but it's really polished once you do. The gunplay is functional but obviously not the focus of the game. It took me a good 30 hours to get through the game with 100% completion and something like another 10 with the DLC. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes freeroaming, action-packed sandbox games in the style of GTA, but not a direct clone itself			",178,34,8,20,10,2,16

The only thing i did not like was the fact that getting a gun in this game is hard as it is removed not long after a mission. But thats not a game breaker at all as the shooting elements in this game are far and few in between. So it is not a shooter like the first two are. But still a must buy and a must play.

												Great artwork, well written story, diverse music selection, fantastic sand boxed freedom of enviorment, high replay potential, and more kung fu than you can shake a tire iron at.Worth the money even at retail, and a real bargin if you can get it for less. If you like GTA, fighting games, racing games, detective stories and RPG I suggest you give this game a shot.Great care was given to the behavior of ambient residents of Hong Kong. I was impressed to see dock workers working, traffic adjusted by working hours,  and people cleaning floors at the club in the off hours. Everywhere you look, people are doing their own thing and the variety of  behaviors is not to underestimated in the games value of setting you firmly in a living cinematic experience. The amount of 3d modeled objects is overwhelming. I wish I could play it in 3D which is also avaiable.I am not a franchise fan easily, but in this case I hope for more  from this development team.

It ruined the whole ""working from the bottom"" storyline, as I am now richer than 99% of the world, I have the fastest cars and enough clothing to pull off anything.			",308,69,3,48,32,4,76

												Dear Reader,Sleeping Dogs is a spectactular game. With a lovely story where everyone is happy and they gets what they want, it makes for a truely realistic experience of what it is like being a man living in Hong Kong. In Sleeping Dogs, there is no violence or drama, but it makes up for that with lots of heartfelt, family-friendly humor. I have personally put almost 24 hours worth of my time into this game, and I do intend to put more. So, if you do get bored with your mindless slaughter of innocent NPC's, purchase and enjoy Sleeping Dogs today.Love,Fossor_			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I LOVE sleeping dogs so much - I go punch a bunch of civilians until a cop shows up, grab his gun, jump in a bus, and get the whole police department to follow me in a parade down the highway. Just getting my wanted level to five and then getting away is enough of a game in and of itself. the gameplay feels much more refined then GTA 4, and the driving is top notch.I would suggest getting at least one fast DLC car from the start - just so you can cruse down the highway when you don't feel like doing missions.

												Sleeping Dogs provides players with an engrossing narrative set to the atmospheric and richly-detailed backdrop of Hong Kong. An extensive array of additional missions and activities ensure there are always opportunities for further adventure and action to discover while roaming the streets. Along with an impressive presentation for both the visuals and music, Sleeping Dogs is without doubt the sleeper hit of this year for open world action games. 10/10			",818,292,31,71,71,8,120

												Not a bad game considering grand theft auto being the game to fight for the attention. This game has the detailed worlf of hong kong but inhibits a rigid on the rails kind of driving/racing/crashing, the fighting is very batman AA or AC eitherway its hectic and a real button masher. there are lots to pick up and collect along the way for power ups and move sets. The city is not immensly huge but very detailed. Its alot like Deus ex humna revolution. and it takes a bit to get used to driving into oncoming traffic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A GTA lookalike open world sandbox playing in Hong Kong with extremely nice and fluid visuals and the best in class combat system.Golden bits:First and foremost the combat system. This is absolutely the best in the game and the best combat I ever had the chance of playing in a game that is not purely a combat game. Or maybe even including those. Combat is super fluid and adapts wonderfully to the situation while not featuring ridiculously complicated controller button combos.The abundance of good looking chicks. I mean this game features an extremely high percentage of 10/10 females wandering the streets of this city.  Mrs. Chu without a doubt. One cannot not like her to the point handling of the butcher knife. Your apartment in Central. Great shed - too bad the toilet seems to be always full of some yellow substance.Stinky bits:FOW inside apartments. While the FOW is OK during the action sequences in the city it gets terribly narrow inside apartments. Instant vomit.Racing sequences. There are 18 of these and strictly not fun. I am not saying they are difficult they are just the worst executed bits of an otherwise great game. Vehicle damage modelling. Sucks. Cars take a stupidly large amount of punishment before they explode.The 2 DLCs with achievements. They are extremely dragged out and boring. They also take away some of the skills you already got in the main game which is mad. I suggest playing the DLCs before finishing the main game in case you would wanna go for a 100% completion - otherwise they would feel very much like a bad afterthought.Stat award achievements. It is not nice having got to grind these after finishing the game. Not nice at all.All in all it is still very much Recommended. (8/10)			",118,49,1,39,14,3,37

												This is one of the better ""free roam the city in a car and kill some dudes now and then"" games I've played. There's a newer, crappier version of it out now that you're expected to purchase instead that ""improves"" the graphics and makes the game a sloppy buggy mess.This original release is smooth, pretty, and I experienced no issues in my time with it. XBOX controller support is perfect so no worries there. The hand to hand combat is copied and pasted from the Batman Arkham series and is fun and fulfilling. Occasionally you'll get a gun with limited ammo, the story established reasoning behind this is even for cops firearms are very limited in Hong Kong. They appear often enough to keep you satiated anyway.The story is deep and interesting, and makes you care about the player character and his companions. I won't get too into it cuz go play the game but you're an undercover cop infiltrating the gangs that have taken over your home town.I'd play this over GTA V any day.			",504,73,6,33,20,3,35

												This game reminds me of mixing 2 great games: GTA 3 San Andreas & a really slept on classic: Oni Worth the price in every aspects. It's a pure gem! Very realistic fighting system, brutal enviroment attacks & special techniques, disarming, exciting gunfights, cool graphics, exciting story, side missions, races, collectibles, etc. Fight clubs are really challenging in the beginnings. Tutorial is part of the game, I played more than once because I was amazed by the first bigger fight on the roof :-) After that even more came.I only didn't like the handling of cars & especially bikes. I had to learn it with left hand...but I did it :-) And be aware of money, outfit, car & xp DLCs. Next time you play the game you will get them after the first mission which will make the game less challenging. Absolutely recommended!			",61,2,5,6,7,1,35

												Personal GOTY 2012I like this game due to an open world game that actually didnt focus on guns, the melee combat was very fun with so many techniques and the use of environmental damage. Running and jumping across buildings was also fun.The game also holds a leveling system that depends how you complete missions as a cop or a criminal.Unlike GTA4, the story actually kept me interested throughout with a actual likable character.Dont expect too much out of smart AI, radio stations, and city size. Even if these are small things youll be noticing them alot later in the game.Good fun for a game that was released in a year that had nothing to offer			",217,30,4,17,11,1,30

												I had heard quite a bit of pleasantly-surprised hype about this game. Apparently everyone expected something that sucked, due to the game's storied past - it was originally a True Crime game? So when it went on sale I decided to pick it up for myself. You've probably played this game in one form or another, it's a GTA-alike sandbox game, only this time, it's heavily Chinese-influenced, set in Hong Kong. The setting is probably the best part of this game, it's both well-fleshed out and novel, and the game seems to sport more of a ""living"" environment than the sometimes sterile underpopulated cities of other GTAlikes. That said there are only a few mission types, and they tend to repeat themselves over and over. The game starts with a parkour chase-scene, and you do chase-scene after chase-scene, after chase-scene. You'll hate them by the end of the game. What is interesting is the game's combat- there are few guns, at least initially, and you dispatch most enemies with a well fleshed out kung-fu system. The story missions carry the plot, though without much pacing. It's a rags-to-riches criminal tale with a twist, you're an uncover cop, trying to move up in the mob. Things kind of meander along until it just suddenly ends- they could have easily cut the story in half. There's a ton of padding in the form of side missions, but those are nearly always more repetitive than refreshing. I'd place the game higher than the GTA-series, but it's not nearly as good as Saints Row. Pleased I picked it up on sale, if you're interested, you should too.			",714,201,33,112,78,8,164

												I've yet to finish this game and I still love it and would recommend it. At first, I thought it was just going to be a basic ""do bunch of criminal activities while secretly a cop"", but I was so wrong. There is a legitimate story here, and the intensity with which it builds surprised me greatly. In fact, after a major event close to halfway through (not going to spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it), I actually nearly shed tears. For the game to make me that invested in the characters and what happens to them is proof of how great it is. Wei Shen is a badass, but the game clearly pushes his character HARD, and it's amazing to see the difference in him as the story progresses and he's drawn further and further into not only the goings on within the Triads, but his mission as a cop as well.I personally love that there's a HUGE RPG aspect to this as well. You have three different experience sections. Cop Experience which increases as you do cases for the police and drug busts, but also completing missions without any damage to people or property, Triad Experience which is given for kicking♥♥♥♥♥and being as violent as you can possibly be, and Face Experience which is gained through favors for various people around Hong Kong. I don't think there's any reward/penalty to working one over the other and leveling each allows you to pick new perks. Overall, it felt like the rewards for progression were quite valuable.There's a lot to say, but obviously I'm not going to write a novel about it :P In short, you can level up, you can buy new clothes that also give passive bonuses for wearing sets (or just look whatever part you want), you can spiff up your apartments if you just need to blow some cash, there's stuff to collect to gain more money, increase your HP, or learn new moves as part of a side quest....basically it's filled to the brim with anything an RPG fan would want.So yes....give a shot. It's an impressive game and one I've let go for too long.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the combat system in the game, it really captures being a streat thug. Most people bring up GTA when personally I found this game more comparable to games like Assasins Creed and Arkham City with the heavy focus on melee. It has a unique story that actually fits the world, and feels real. You are a undercover cop with close connections with the Triads, some maybe... too close. But it doesn't do that BS ""choose a side, one or the other."" instead you watch Wei struggle with both, and it's a better game/story because of it. Definitely worth a play-through, although a lot of the DLC you can live without.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all let me say one thing, this is the most similar thing to what I wanted GTA IV to be. That said, I can only complement this game, it is really well optimized and I cannot say enough how I enjoyed my time with this title despite not completing every single race and challenge. The gameplay of Sleeping Dogs focus on melee combat with a huge variety of combos along with the driving. The melee combat  reminded me of Assassins Creed but only better, you can learn new moves by completing challenges and/or missions and these will help you on later main story missions. The driving is probably the best I've seen on an open world game like this, it might not have planes and choppers but the car driving is REALLY enjoyable, I didn't liked riding bikes though. The soundtrack really fits the theme of the game that is set in Hong Kong and the landscape ranges from mundane places to skyscrappers fully covered with advertisement and neon lights. The game also features a multiple set of houses that you gain as you progress through the main story and near those places you find a parking lot which will grant you access to all your vehicles that you've bought. Let's just say it has basicly all the elements of games like Saints Row and GTA clothing, food, cars etc. Now the story is quite good in my honest opinion and it features an undercover cop (the player) that returned to Hong Kong after living on the USA for years and he infiltrates the Triads not only in order to cripple one of the main gangs but also because he's on a personal crusade to deal with issues from the past. Other than that, you'll have to find it by yourself by playing the game, I cannot recommend it enough. Buy it, play it, enjoy it.			",1396,387,26,190,117,15,203

												I've yet to finish this game and I still love it and would recommend it. At first, I thought it was just going to be a basic ""do bunch of criminal activities while secretly a cop"", but I was so wrong. There is a legitimate story here, and the intensity with which it builds surprised me greatly. In fact, after a major event close to halfway through (not going to spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it), I actually nearly shed tears. For the game to make me that invested in the characters and what happens to them is proof of how great it is. Wei Shen is a badass, but the game clearly pushes his character HARD, and it's amazing to see the difference in him as the story progresses and he's drawn further and further into not only the goings on within the Triads, but his mission as a cop as well.I personally love that there's a HUGE RPG aspect to this as well. You have three different experience sections. Cop Experience which increases as you do cases for the police and drug busts, but also completing missions without any damage to people or property, Triad Experience which is given for kicking♥♥♥♥♥and being as violent as you can possibly be, and Face Experience which is gained through favors for various people around Hong Kong. I don't think there's any reward/penalty to working one over the other and leveling each allows you to pick new perks. Overall, it felt like the rewards for progression were quite valuable.There's a lot to say, but obviously I'm not going to write a novel about it :P In short, you can level up, you can buy new clothes that also give passive bonuses for wearing sets (or just look whatever part you want), you can spiff up your apartments if you just need to blow some cash, there's stuff to collect to gain more money, increase your HP, or learn new moves as part of a side quest....basically it's filled to the brim with anything an RPG fan would want.So yes....give a shot. It's an impressive game and one I've let go for too long.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short response. Grand Theft Auto in Hong Kong. If you enjoy GTA you will enjoy this.However, having said that. Sleeping Dogs story is much better then the GTA franchise, it has its ups and downs but overall quite enjoyed it. The city has a definite unique feel to it however can feel small and at times repetitive in the paths you take to get from point A to point B.Melee combat is the main focal point with a few weapons becoming the strong point later on in the game.Highly enjoyed this game, 15 hours to complete the story line. Still quite a few collectables such as health, jade statues (unlocks new melee skills), vehicles, lock boxes and missions to complete.Would recommend and definitely buy on a sale!

												A mixture of Max Payne and GTA; this game is a must play. The story resembles a classic ""Kung-Fu Action Film"" in which Wei Shen (the protagonist) plays as an undercover cop in Hong Kong, trying to bring down the overwelming Triad force that rules the city. It's chaotic, heartwarming, bloody, and beautiful at the same time. The game is packed with all sorts of missions and side missions, including melee fights, gun fights, training in the Dojo to learn new moves, racing, dating, drug busting, collecting sports cars, chicken fights, photography, car chases, karaoke, going to fight clubs, and more. I should also mention the combat and movement, which is superb. Kung-fu melee combat AND freeroaming with parkour? Phenomenal.All I can say is that if you're looking for a great freeroaming game with a compelling story, or a freeroam that's looking to spice things up a bit; this game is for you. This game does need some fairly decent hardware if you want it to run properly, and I highly recommend getting the HD Texturepack. I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel!Enjoy.

												Fluid combat, upgrades, customization, a wide variety of available side missions and a well written story makes Sleeping Dogs one of the best open world games I've ever played. If you like these kinds of games, I suggest you pick this one up whenever you can.You take the role of an undercover cop with a history of violence who is given the task of destroying the Triad from the inside-out. However as the story progresses things go from just business to personal matters. The story is really down-to-earth, and the characters are relatable enough to get the full enjoyment out of the missions.Even after finishing the game there is plenty of things left to do. Buy new clothes, max your upgrades, participate in street races, or even go sing karaoke. Hong Kong is your playground.The melee combat is what really sold me on this game. The ability to string together my own combos, learn new moves, and even use the environment was a refreshing change from the usual run-and-gun gameplay open world games seem to lean towards.A fantastic game all around. I'll definitely start a second playthough.			",315,40,4,34,20,1,30

												A lengthy and engaging undercover cop story merged with a metric ton of variety-filled missions and smooth martial arts combat. Unlike most open-world games, the missions don't devolve into repetitive slogs through waves of enemies. Karaoke, street-racing, gang wars, dates, and stealth missions are balanced perfectly for a carefully concocted recipe of Hong Kong brawling, gun-fighting goodness.FYI, I played this game for many more than 6 hours. I'm not always online when I play games (see my Tomb Raider Legend review too, where it says I've only played it for 0 hours, but when in reality I've played it for more than 10 hours). I would put my estimate for Sleeping Dogs at around 20 hours.			",106,20,1,13,2,1,6

												Sleeping Dogs is everything I wanted from a GTA set in Hong Kong. If you wanted Infernal Affairs and a healthy sprinking of action from every Jackie Chan movie ever, this game is perfect!The storyline is well written and impressively acted. You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop, who needs to choose between loyalty to his new criminal brethren or to his duty as a police officer, people on both sides get suspicious, tense moments of untrustworthy accusations, etc. Kind of cliche, to be honest. If you've seen Infernal Affairs, or one of the many Hong Kong police dramas (or the US version The Departed) you have a general sense of what the story is about. Unfortunately the ending is a bit lackluster and you don't really get to make too many choices in the game. Nevertheless, it was interesting enough to keep me engaged for the 20 hour or so through the main storyline.The more melee focused combat is something more akin to the Arkham series and is fun to enough to keep your interested through the entire game. There is some good ol' cover based shooting/ sweet slow motion but I felt like that was definitely the weakest part of the combat. You can do a bunch of badass♥♥♥♥♥♥like jack a car by jump from a moving car to another moving car so it's usually pretty fun to get into fights.Sleeping Dogs unfortunately falls into the familiar trap of ""Go here, beat up that guy"", or ""Go here and steal this car."" that plague so many open world games. Still, the game is so cheap during sales these days, and the combat is so fun you'll find yourself walking around the streets just cruisin' for a bruisin'.I'd highly recommend this is if you're into GTA or Action films in general, it's a lot of fun for the price and the DLCs can be some goofy fun.

												Sleeping Dogs is an open world action-adventure video game developed by United Front Games and Square Enix London. The game has you infiltrating the ranks of the Triads as undercover cop Wei Shen on an island off the mainland of Hong Kong.Sleeping Dogs places a strong emphasis on hand to hand combat giving you the opportunity to unlock a wide range of different combos to be used while fighting. The combat very closely resembles that of Batman: Arkham City however doesn't feel as smooth, regardless anyone who enjoyed that series will probably enjoy this.			",156,8,4,13,16,1,8

												This totally surprised me. Honk Kong is great place for sandbox game, and map is quite damn large. Game is mostly based on melee combat, but you'll also have weapons later in game. Melee system is great, it has lots of different moves to learn. Game has lots of vehicles, motorcycles and cars. You can steal any car from street as you should, or you can pay taxidriver to take you where you want if you're too lazy to drive yourself, and then rob his car. Most cars are fast, and pretty easy to control. You can buy yourself cars, which will be added to garage.Storyline is about undercover cop, if someone did not know that, it is interesting, but nothing spectacular. Sound acting is in  English, and some Chinese phrases are part of it.Game has about 20 hours of gameplay, which also includes some of collectibles.I was interested in this game, and decided to buy it when it was on sale. I do not regret buying it, it is great game, one of my favorites in 2012. ",954,273,26,84,87,9,85

												Sleeping Dogs has a lot of excellent content, including a compelling story where you actually care about the hero and the choices he is forced to make.  The graphics are quite nice, and the combat system both with and without weapons and in and out of vehicles is fluid and intuitive.  Watching a chasing car explode and flip over has a certain delight to it.  Buy it during a sale with a splash of DLCs (most are good, go by what sounds neat to you), and you won't regret it.

												This sandbox game does so many things right. The combat (mostly unarmed brawling) is lifted directly from Batman: Arkham Asylum, the story is engaging, the controls are tight (gamepad recommended), the city (Hong Kong) is exotic and interesting, the RPG elements reward completionists like myself, and most importantly, checkpoints are frequent so you rarely have to redo an entire mission from scratch unless you want to.The only thing I feel is missing is more/deeper character customization, but that's par for the course with every non-RPG sandbox game outside of the Saint's Row.

												Well worth the current $5 dollar price tag! Sleeping Dogs is unfortunately an underrated gem of a game. Originally under fruition as True Crime Hong Kong, Sleeping Dogs came to be when Square Enix revived this IP. The player takes charge of the main character named Wei Shen. Wei acts as an undercover police offficer who becomes deeply involved with the Triad underground. As the story progresses the player begins to learn about Wei's background and how he got into this predicament. Full of action, adventure, and emotions, Sleeping Dogs is in my opinion a solid 8.5 out of 10. With amazing voice acting, a riveting story, interesting characters, and an open world that feels alive, Sleeping Dogs is sure to entertain any free roam/single player advocates!

												Sleeping Dogs is a fantastic Open-world sandbox Game with a great Story and an awesome atmosphere. Single Objects in the world may not look like they are from Crysis, but all together just looks so great. The PC Port is good, plenty Settings and Adjustments to be made. It even supports 3D and you can scale the HUD size, which is something not a lot of games support.The Story, as mentioned above is really good, you can sometimes expect what will happen which is not that good, but all in all is pretty good and not too serious. You play as undercover Cop, trying to lock down the Leader of the Triads. There are plenty of missions to do in the Huge Map, like racing, doing Favors for people and figthing. The ending is reasonable satisfying, but after I finished the main story (approx. 20 Hours with some side-missions), there is no incentive to do the remaining side-missions.Sidenote: You need a pretty beefy System to run this game at higher than low details. On my 500 euro PC with an i3 and a Radeon HD 7750 it runs at ~50 FPS, 1080p and min details.			",137,34,7,6,9,1,8

												Absolutely great and overlooked game! The matial arts combat is very remincent of the Batman Arham games and is polished. The gun play is alright and it's relative rarity compared to the hand to hand combat keeps it fresh. It has great visuals, the city seems alive and colorful, and the driving is silky smooth. Finally, the story mode is engaging and well voice acted. Similar to other 'open world' games, there are  a variety of side missions and minigames--such as kareokee. Would definately recommend, especially given a discounted price.			",213,46,5,47,32,3,42

												A spiritual successor to the 'True Crimes' series, Sleeping Dogs is a rebirth of what the True Crimes game SHOULD have been like. An open world game of this genre that takes place outside of the United States (or an implied) is a fresh and nice change of scenery. Sleeping Dogs takes place in Hong Kong, the home base of the Chinese Triads. You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop that walks a very thin line between loyalites. Sleeping Dogs takes on the Hong Kong cop genre and does a fantastic job of telling you a story backed with fun gameplay.The visuals of the game is solid and it is to be expected out of any game with Square Enix label on it. Especially in cutscenes, everything is crisp. Which is important for a story driven game such as this one. In game graphics shows the enviroment very well. When it rains, the clothing on Wei does get wet and it shows. Little details, like blood and bruises after getting into a brawl shows up on Wei's face and on his clothing as well.  Damage to cars is admittedly, pretty standard in these games. Paint will be scratched up if you brush up too closely to another car and bullet holes will show up if shot at. Visuals are at its finest at the most important aspects of the game, while some little details could have used a little more work.Gameplay might be a little different from what people expect from an open world game of this type of genre. While you can go on shooting rampages and crime spree when you are free roaming, it isn't anything like the calibur of GTA. You don't start out with a gun or have any places to buy weapons, melee combat is the name of the game in Sleeping Dogs. You'll be punching, kicking and slamming your enemies down on the ground alot. The melee combat is fairly firmilar to the Arkham games, but isn't as stylish. They mix it up a bit by throwing different types of enemies, like certain enemies cannot be grabbed and certain enemies dish out more damage than others. Enemies could have used more work and variations. You can upgrade your melee skins by collecting Jade Statues, which unlocks new melee combo strings or get triad upgrades which you get buffs and more combo strings. Combat is passable in this game and you shouldn't be detered by the fact it isn't just like the Arkham games.Sleeping Dogs is a very story driven game. You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop on a mission to infiltrate the ranks of the Triad. Wei throughout the game is faced with conflicting loyalities, he has a personal vendetta to settle with one of the members and has to deal with his growing attachment towards the triads. The story and setting really does feel like a hong kong cop drama. Overall, Sleeping Dogs is a solid buy. It has enough side missions to extend gameplay. Some of the best side missions are the street races. It is a nice change of pace from triple A titles. Its definitely a cult hit. Definitely worth putting in your library of games. Sleeping Dogs is an experience that won't disappoint you.Sleeping Dogs has quite a few DLCs with it, here is a list of DLCs that is worth getting. 1. Year of the Snake. A post game DLC that gives Wei a police mission to stop something big going down in the Chinese New Years.2. Nightmare on North Point. A stand alone DLC that has Wei fighting Chinese vampires and a vengeful spirit of a dead and forgotten triad leader.3. Zodiac Tournament. A DLC that is intergrated with the main game. A throwback to the 70s with corny Kung Fu action that pits Wei with some of the worlds finest martial artist and a corny plot. (Story has nothing to do with the main story)4. Street Racer Pack. Adds 3 more challenging races to the game. (Not worth getting at full price, wait for a sale on this one)The rest of the DLC are almost all cosmetic, unless you really want more outfits and access to certain guns for Wei, its better to buy them when there is a sale. Not worth getting at full price.			",180,46,3,22,12,2,23

												Expected a 'cheap thrill gta-clone. Was pleasantly suprised. Sleeping Dogs offers an interesting storyline that explores the moral gaps between the archetypical 'good' and 'bad'. The inevitable climax was satisfying in its execution (pun intended) but left me with a terrible aftertaste from what happened. Ultimately, the pacing was good and the delivery often excellent, although characters didn't always get the chance to fully develop beyond what was required in order to act as a development 'tool' for the protagonist.In regards to gameplay, i was very satisfied. Sleeping Dogs borrows many elements from other franchises. Free-running through the city had an AC-touch to it. Shootouts were heavily inspired by Max Payne and driving reminded me of NFS. Most of the gameplay revolving action (shooting, driving) felt fluent and leaned heavily towards an arcade style. Meaning fast and destructive action had precedence over 'realism'. This can sway some people away from the game, but in my opinion it is a proper design choice - it stands in nice contrast with the ever-looming shadow that is the GTA franchise.Overall, this game is quite good. The world is fleshed out with a lot of content; missions, jobs, favors, events, minigames; a lot of things are present to ensure that there is enough to do besides playing out the storyline which, because it's an open world crime game, felt relatively short clocking in at ~15 hours.

The game is action packed for those who don't want/need to do the ""side quests"" otherwise it can be repetitive. Especially weak are the favors.DLCsThe Year of the Snake - kind of sucks, short and dull.

												A great mix of GTA, Assassin's Creed and LA Noire in a fantastic Hong Kong setting. The story is a Triad tour-de-force, but it's a shame some of the side missions were never fleshed out. Driving isn't great either, but the hand-to-hand combat is satisfying. Great game, thoroughly enjoyable.			",320,92,10,48,61,4,63

												Absolutely great and overlooked game! The matial arts combat is very remincent of the Batman Arham games and is polished. The gun play is alright and it's relative rarity compared to the hand to hand combat keeps it fresh. It has great visuals, the city seems alive and colorful, and the driving is silky smooth. Finally, the story mode is engaging and well voice acted. Similar to other 'open world' games, there are  a variety of side missions and minigames--such as kareokee. Would definately recommend, especially given a discounted price.			",213,46,5,47,32,3,42

												Sleeping Dogs is a fantastic Open-world sandbox Game with a great Story and an awesome atmosphere. Single Objects in the world may not look like they are from Crysis, but all together just looks so great. The PC Port is good, plenty Settings and Adjustments to be made. It even supports 3D and you can scale the HUD size, which is something not a lot of games support.The Story, as mentioned above is really good, you can sometimes expect what will happen which is not that good, but all in all is pretty good and not too serious. You play as undercover Cop, trying to lock down the Leader of the Triads. There are plenty of missions to do in the Huge Map, like racing, doing Favors for people and figthing. The ending is reasonable satisfying, but after I finished the main story (approx. 20 Hours with some side-missions), there is no incentive to do the remaining side-missions.Sidenote: You need a pretty beefy System to run this game at higher than low details. On my 500 euro PC with an i3 and a Radeon HD 7750 it runs at ~50 FPS, 1080p and min details.			",137,34,7,6,9,1,8

												A spiritual successor to the 'True Crimes' series, Sleeping Dogs is a rebirth of what the True Crimes game SHOULD have been like. An open world game of this genre that takes place outside of the United States (or an implied) is a fresh and nice change of scenery. Sleeping Dogs takes place in Hong Kong, the home base of the Chinese Triads. You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop that walks a very thin line between loyalites. Sleeping Dogs takes on the Hong Kong cop genre and does a fantastic job of telling you a story backed with fun gameplay.The visuals of the game is solid and it is to be expected out of any game with Square Enix label on it. Especially in cutscenes, everything is crisp. Which is important for a story driven game such as this one. In game graphics shows the enviroment very well. When it rains, the clothing on Wei does get wet and it shows. Little details, like blood and bruises after getting into a brawl shows up on Wei's face and on his clothing as well.  Damage to cars is admittedly, pretty standard in these games. Paint will be scratched up if you brush up too closely to another car and bullet holes will show up if shot at. Visuals are at its finest at the most important aspects of the game, while some little details could have used a little more work.Gameplay might be a little different from what people expect from an open world game of this type of genre. While you can go on shooting rampages and crime spree when you are free roaming, it isn't anything like the calibur of GTA. You don't start out with a gun or have any places to buy weapons, melee combat is the name of the game in Sleeping Dogs. You'll be punching, kicking and slamming your enemies down on the ground alot. The melee combat is fairly firmilar to the Arkham games, but isn't as stylish. They mix it up a bit by throwing different types of enemies, like certain enemies cannot be grabbed and certain enemies dish out more damage than others. Enemies could have used more work and variations. You can upgrade your melee skins by collecting Jade Statues, which unlocks new melee combo strings or get triad upgrades which you get buffs and more combo strings. Combat is passable in this game and you shouldn't be detered by the fact it isn't just like the Arkham games.Sleeping Dogs is a very story driven game. You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop on a mission to infiltrate the ranks of the Triad. Wei throughout the game is faced with conflicting loyalities, he has a personal vendetta to settle with one of the members and has to deal with his growing attachment towards the triads. The story and setting really does feel like a hong kong cop drama. Overall, Sleeping Dogs is a solid buy. It has enough side missions to extend gameplay. Some of the best side missions are the street races. It is a nice change of pace from triple A titles. Its definitely a cult hit. Definitely worth putting in your library of games. Sleeping Dogs is an experience that won't disappoint you.Sleeping Dogs has quite a few DLCs with it, here is a list of DLCs that is worth getting. 1. Year of the Snake. A post game DLC that gives Wei a police mission to stop something big going down in the Chinese New Years.2. Nightmare on North Point. A stand alone DLC that has Wei fighting Chinese vampires and a vengeful spirit of a dead and forgotten triad leader.3. Zodiac Tournament. A DLC that is intergrated with the main game. A throwback to the 70s with corny Kung Fu action that pits Wei with some of the worlds finest martial artist and a corny plot. (Story has nothing to do with the main story)4. Street Racer Pack. Adds 3 more challenging races to the game. (Not worth getting at full price, wait for a sale on this one)The rest of the DLC are almost all cosmetic, unless you really want more outfits and access to certain guns for Wei, its better to buy them when there is a sale. Not worth getting at full price.			",180,46,3,22,12,2,23

												This game has some really strong points. The combat is fresh, interesting and progressive. If you ever want to feel like a badass, this is the game. I was pleasantly surprised how little it relies on gun use, but for those who really enjoy FPS games this isn't for you, as the gun options are little in selection. The focus is in the melee combat, and the attention it gives is great. It's not very hard to get into, but still very satisfying to play. The next big aspect of this game I loved is the environment, and installing the free High-res graphics DLC doesn't change it as much as I expected, but still makes it pop. You may not enjoy it nearly as much as I did without running it on high graphics, but it's still very attractive (I've always liked the slums of hong kong scene, not sure why but it's really cool)  The driving was a little bit odd, but once you purchase a high-end vehicle it only adds to the badass-itude. The story was a little generic, just with Asian flair, but not necessarily disappointing. I'd very much recommend the game, I grabbed it on sale but $20 for it still worth a grab.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well worth the current $5 dollar price tag! Sleeping Dogs is unfortunately an underrated gem of a game. Originally under fruition as True Crime Hong Kong, Sleeping Dogs came to be when Square Enix revived this IP. The player takes charge of the main character named Wei Shen. Wei acts as an undercover police offficer who becomes deeply involved with the Triad underground. As the story progresses the player begins to learn about Wei's background and how he got into this predicament. Full of action, adventure, and emotions, Sleeping Dogs is in my opinion a solid 8.5 out of 10. With amazing voice acting, a riveting story, interesting characters, and an open world that feels alive, Sleeping Dogs is sure to entertain any free roam/single player advocates!

												8.5/10Excellent game. If you're looking for a fresh new experience in gaming, definitely pick this game up. The open-world is extremely polished and detailed, giving a truly immersive experience. The volumetric lighting, food vendors, soda machines, rusty air conditioners, high density vehicles and NPCs, real-time weather change, and local radio are all present as if you were actually in Hong Kong. The story is strongly focused and engaging as you control an undercover cop to reveal the dark world of the Triads. The gameplay is solid. The shooting mechanics are fluid and action-packed. The guns are big and satisfying to use. As for the driving component, you'll feel like a true asian ricer blazing through the night life. When you have to fight, the combos are easy to memorize and satisfying to execute. Unlike the original True Crime, there's actually strategy involved than just mindless button mashing.However, the game is intended to be played linearly (which I prefer actually) and not like a sandbox. So, the replay value is limited if you're concerned.			",159,11,2,13,7,0,22

												Loads of fun and violence! It reminded me of Yakuza (Playstation exclusive) but sandboxed and with more friendly and showy combat system. There are some environmental ""finishers"" which add a taste to the fights. Good, engaging story. The game is action packed for those who don't want/need to do the ""side quests"" otherwise it can be repetitive. Especially weak are the favors.DLCsThe Year of the Snake - kind of sucks, short and dull. Two not-so-good cutscenes - totaly not worth it.Nightmare in North Point - the story is not so bad, zombies are good, but it's short.Zodiac Tournament - very cool addon, tough fights, nice story but again short.

												It's like playing through a movie, staring a modern Bruce Lee. Despite the stiff faced animations and some of the cliche plot elements, Sleeping Dogs is a wonderful game to play. I love open world games, especially ones set in a city, being set in Hong Kong was just the iceing on the cake. The gangster themes in this make some of the concepts in the GTA series look tame...beating a cheating girlfriend to a pulp, throwing her in the trunk of your stolen car, and then pushing her face into a table saw? That's just f**ked for the lack of better words. But that's the kind of stuff you'll have to get used to in the underground world of Hong Kong, it's dark, brutal, draws you in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are a lot of fun missions and sub-missions to do, and while you're not doing missions it's fun just to play around in the world. There's something to do around every corner.Some say the combat is a bit repetitive but I find it satisfying and addictive while sometimes being a challenge against harder enemies, unlike some other games where 1 stringed combo will kill every enemy around you.Good graphics, customisable clothes and some fun mechanics.It also works great with an xbox controller.Highly underrated.

												--TL:DR--Sleeping Dogs is what would happen if the gameplay from GTA 4 and the setting+story from Rush Hour 2 combined and made a baby game that later got married in life to the combat system from Arkham Asylum. It's good.--The Good--Combat: This combat system feels like you are Bruce Lee (RIP) and the entire gang population of Hong Kong decided all at once to test your skills in honorable combat. The dishonorable ones are those with firearms, instead of finding your own, teach them a lesson in the way of the dragon. Also, there are multi-target counters, and yes they are awesome. The depth of the combat system is a great core foundation, there are grapples, environmental attacks, melee weapons, ranged weapons, combos, heavy/light attacks (with variants of each level of combo). Overall a great combat system.Story: Undercover cop dives into the criminal underworld of Hong Kong to usurp the leadership and bring down the crime families from the inside. A premise that has been done before in film, and it is nice to see a quality interpretation of this type of story done in a video game. The pacing is structured between gang missions and police missions, giving you the story at a pace that you decide. It also allows for both sides of the story be told seperately and interestingly they occasionally interset. Overall good story.Characters: From the main protagonist and his own personal demons as he infiltrates his childhood friends gang turf, to the leaders of each respective gang and the respect they garner. I found each character to be well crafted as well as acted. There are some bad characters however, most notably the ""tourist"" from america who occasionally pops up looking for martial arts training. She is well acted but the character just feels forced.--The Bad--Gunplay: Complaining about bad gunplay in a kungfu game is like complaining you had a fly in your soup that you got for free with a really good sandwich. The sandwich being the best part of the meal and the soup (being secondary to the main dish) was a little bit disapointing that you found a fly in it. Gunplay in Sleeping Dogs is just bad, no lie. There are situations where you wish you could shoot the main character into melee range so the beat downs can continue. I personally am not a fan, as the firearms don't have a quality sound nor do they feel good. It works but its not the focus of the combat.--The Meh--Sidemissions: Not much of note here. They are typical open world fair, defeat the bad guys on the corner, street race, collect treasure, ect. There are a few stand outs like kareoke, as well as the training you can do after collecting a statue for your masters dojo (something about beating up kung fu students in those missions is great)			",93,10,2,6,1,0,18

												Great Game and a favorite.With so many to choose from, sometimes classics get over looked.Square Enix really put it together, with some really great artists of the industry.There are some more mature scenes for older audiences, but at least it isn't without some type of moral/spiritual standard.I hope someday, games like this will be available handheld and available to the world, in its respective languages, and hopefully character/personalization choice.I hope even more, someday it becomes more unified.

												After trying for years to get into open world games such as GTA I had all but given up on the genre. However, after watching the Giant Bomb quickly ok of this game I decided to take a chance and purchase it and thank god I did. Everything from the atmosphere to the NPCs had be hooked.The little details make the game world come alive which adds to the experience. Would highly recommend this to everyone			",163,15,2,26,7,0,34

												--TL:DR--Sleeping Dogs is what would happen if the gameplay from GTA 4 and the setting+story from Rush Hour 2 combined and made a baby game that later got married in life to the combat system from Arkham Asylum. It's good.--The Good--Combat: This combat system feels like you are Bruce Lee (RIP) and the entire gang population of Hong Kong decided all at once to test your skills in honorable combat. The dishonorable ones are those with firearms, instead of finding your own, teach them a lesson in the way of the dragon. Also, there are multi-target counters, and yes they are awesome. The depth of the combat system is a great core foundation, there are grapples, environmental attacks, melee weapons, ranged weapons, combos, heavy/light attacks (with variants of each level of combo). Overall a great combat system.Story: Undercover cop dives into the criminal underworld of Hong Kong to usurp the leadership and bring down the crime families from the inside. A premise that has been done before in film, and it is nice to see a quality interpretation of this type of story done in a video game. The pacing is structured between gang missions and police missions, giving you the story at a pace that you decide. It also allows for both sides of the story be told seperately and interestingly they occasionally interset. Overall good story.Characters: From the main protagonist and his own personal demons as he infiltrates his childhood friends gang turf, to the leaders of each respective gang and the respect they garner. I found each character to be well crafted as well as acted. There are some bad characters however, most notably the ""tourist"" from america who occasionally pops up looking for martial arts training. She is well acted but the character just feels forced.--The Bad--Gunplay: Complaining about bad gunplay in a kungfu game is like complaining you had a fly in your soup that you got for free with a really good sandwich. The sandwich being the best part of the meal and the soup (being secondary to the main dish) was a little bit disapointing that you found a fly in it. Gunplay in Sleeping Dogs is just bad, no lie. There are situations where you wish you could shoot the main character into melee range so the beat downs can continue. I personally am not a fan, as the firearms don't have a quality sound nor do they feel good. It works but its not the focus of the combat.--The Meh--Sidemissions: Not much of note here. They are typical open world fair, defeat the bad guys on the corner, street race, collect treasure, ect. There are a few stand outs like kareoke, as well as the training you can do after collecting a statue for your masters dojo (something about beating up kung fu students in those missions is great)			",93,10,2,6,1,0,18

												Didn't know what to expect going in to this one but it had been on the ""need to play"" list for a while and I'm glad I finally got around to it.  The gameplay in Sleeping Dogs is top notch.  Everything felt fluid and not a beat was skipped between fighting, cutscenes, gunplay, driving, etc.  The gameplay sort ofdraws comparsions to GTA, Assassin's Creed, Jade Empire and Max Payne, borrowing elements from them all. The mission/quest system works great with the world map and they are done well.  Even the side missions are done well, from racing to beating up crooks I found myself doing side missions, which is odd for me.  It has a super cool story and it was presented well with great graphics.  Overall it was a great game and worth playing for anyone wanting a story driven, open world, action game.

Everything about this game looks great by itself, and they also have an HD texture pack. Not to mention the game isn't to hard to run either. No complaints here!----------------------------------------Sound: 9.75All the music is in another language which is kind of lame, unless you are singing Karaoke. Sound effects and voice acting is spot on. ----------------------------------------Playability: 10Supports Controller and keyboard and does it well. Amazingly optimized for pc, looks good and runs great. no complaints here.----------------------------------------Entertainment: 10I found the game to be very entertaining and fun, and offers alot of fun missions to do (main and side).

												It's like playing through a movie, staring a modern Bruce Lee. Despite the stiff faced animations and some of the cliche plot elements, Sleeping Dogs is a wonderful game to play. I love open world games, especially ones set in a city, being set in Hong Kong was just the iceing on the cake. The gangster themes in this make some of the concepts in the GTA series look tame...beating a cheating girlfriend to a pulp, throwing her in the trunk of your stolen car, and then pushing her face into a table saw? That's just f**ked for the lack of better words. But that's the kind of stuff you'll have to get used to in the underground world of Hong Kong, it's dark, brutal, draws you in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8.5/10Excellent game. If you're looking for a fresh new experience in gaming, definitely pick this game up. The open-world is extremely polished and detailed, giving a truly immersive experience. The volumetric lighting, food vendors, soda machines, rusty air conditioners, high density vehicles and NPCs, real-time weather change, and local radio are all present as if you were actually in Hong Kong. The story is strongly focused and engaging as you control an undercover cop to reveal the dark world of the Triads. The gameplay is solid. The shooting mechanics are fluid and action-packed. The guns are big and satisfying to use. As for the driving component, you'll feel like a true asian ricer blazing through the night life. When you have to fight, the combos are easy to memorize and satisfying to execute. Unlike the original True Crime, there's actually strategy involved than just mindless button mashing.However, the game is intended to be played linearly (which I prefer actually) and not like a sandbox. So, the replay value is limited if you're concerned.			",159,11,2,13,7,0,22

												Loads of fun and violence! It reminded me of Yakuza (Playstation exclusive) but sandboxed and with more friendly and showy combat system. There are some environmental ""finishers"" which add a taste to the fights. Good, engaging story. The game is action packed for those who don't want/need to do the ""side quests"" otherwise it can be repetitive. Especially weak are the favors.DLCsThe Year of the Snake - kind of sucks, short and dull. Two not-so-good cutscenes - totaly not worth it.Nightmare in North Point - the story is not so bad, zombies are good, but it's short.Zodiac Tournament - very cool addon, tough fights, nice story but again short.

												Probably one of the most fun single player games I've ever played. There are a lot of fun missions and sub-missions to do, and while you're not doing missions it's fun just to play around in the world. There's something to do around every corner.Some say the combat is a bit repetitive but I find it satisfying and addictive while sometimes being a challenge against harder enemies, unlike some other games where 1 stringed combo will kill every enemy around you.Good graphics, customisable clothes and some fun mechanics.It also works great with an xbox controller.Highly underrated.

												Sleeping Dogs is a game NOT To be missed if you are a fan of third person sandbox games like Saints Row Or GTA, Sleeping Dogs has an amusing attention to detail, Gorgeous Graphics, Awesomely optimized, and it stands as a perfect Middle between Saints Row`s Goofiness And GTA`s Realism, making it feel fun, With An arcadey feel while mantaining a serious tone In a Down to Earth Universe.

												If you like GTA, you'll like this game. Has a few more details then GTA. Personally, One of my favorite games, though main story should have been longer. Does have lots of side missions and extras that can be completed. While done in a GTA style, definitely has a different sort of feel of it's own.			",208,11,6,43,7,1,9

												Growing up in the 80's and being an Asian, one could not help but to dream about playing a triad gangster. This is Hong Kong. Knockoff capital and triad homeground.The game puts you in the shoes of Wei Shen, a Asian American undercover cop assigned to inflitrate a triad gang, the Sun On Yee.One of the things that will get you on the get go is how the game world is alive with the environs of Hong Kong, complete with street peddlers, suits and the seedy underbelly of the city all for you to explore. The sights and sounds immersion was enough to get you into playing the role of Wei Shen, a cop with a deeper agenda on why he wants to destroy the Sun On Yee. Rating:-Graphics - 8/10 - the best parts of the game happens at night/rain cycleSounds - 8/10 - listening to rap music on HK radio stations while jacking a car? Check.Game Immersion - 7/10 - random padestrians hurling abuse at you if you decide to bang into cars while driving.Combat Mechanics - 6/10 - melee combat is awesome but gunplay lacks realism e.g. no recoilFun Factor - 9/10 - used a fish to beat up a thug in a night club. Fish survived.Overall : 7.5/10 - would be higher if the devs decided to actually not have to re-release the game with tweaks long after people have finished it (am looking at you SD:Definitive Edition)tl;dr - if you haven't gotten it yet, buy it. if you have and already completed it, consider getting the DLCs. One of it pays tribute to the Hong Kong kung-fu filems ala Bruce Lee style.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is for the original version + all the DLC. There will not be any spoilers. Tl;dr at the bottom.So after completing Sleeping Dogs on the Xbox 360 I decided to pick it up for the PC. When I heard the review about the definitive edition I decided it would be best to trade for the complete collection instead, and I have no regrets. The game runs smooth on my pc, probably 50-60 frames when it's raining with the high resolution texture pack. Speaking of graphics the game's visuals are greatly improved making it a pleasure to look at. Just seeing the glowing neon signs popping out everwhere gives this game a certain charm only Deus Ex: Human Revolution (One of my favorite games despite me not even getting to the first boss.) could give me. It's basically eye candy for you neon fans out there. Sleeping Dogs is more of a game that you drive around and look at, but that doesn't mean that the gameplay isn't great. Taking its fighting from the Batman series may be boring in most cases, but in Sleeping Dogs the combat animations make fighting a lot more interesting than other Batman combat clones. For the DLC, I've been enjoying the cop missions as well as the story. Speaking of the story I think it's well executed for its theme, but I won't go into detail since it's best just to play it for yourself. The DLC is looking good so far, but for new players I wouldn't pick up the Gold + Silver pack because it raises you to almost the end-game stats. I would only recommend getting those two packs if you're done/almost done with the game. There is a lot of DLC, too. 24 packs to be exact, but I've enjoyed all of it so far. The outfits are designed very well and the new cars are interesting to look at and fun to drive. I haven't played the DLC missions yet though, but I'm guessing that they're going to be fun based on everything I've seen so far.tl;dr With the striking new visuals (for an xbox 360 user), great performance, and fun Batman combat I'd recommend anyone that played the 360 version or haven't even played the game yet to get your hands on the original + DLC. You won't be dissapointed and it's far from just another Grand Theft Auto clone.			",128,4,2,4,11,3,21

												I haven't finished a Grand Theft Auto game - yet I own 4 of them and have played each. Sleeping Dogs on the other hand has gripped me from the start. It's an open world game centered around a rather boilerplate crime thriller narrative that's elevated due to the impressive voice talent behind it, including Emma Stone, Lucy Lu, Tom Wilkinson (Batman Begins, RocknRolla, Shakespere In Love etc. - if you love movies you know), & legend James Hong (Bladerunner, Big Trouble in Little China) among others. Set in Hong Kong the game offers a nice level of visual enticement and variety for a game set in the present. As with any open world game there is the main narrative or side objectives to explore as well as the city itself, all of which keep you engaged as you sift through its different layers. The soundtrack (via radio stations) is also particularly outstanding, offering a catalog of tunes from Warp Records and Ninja Tune among others (for those in the know). Sleeping Dogs isn't exceptional or unique in its offering, but it is exceptionally competent and a worthwhile adventure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Although there is no multiplayer or online mode on this game. You cannot play with friends in this game. This entire game is single player, and when you complete the campaign, you can only roam around cities and earn cash for cars, clothes etc. Although you cant really show it off cause theres no Multiplayer! I would rate this game 6/10.			",59,10,2,12,4,0,6

												Fluid combat, upgrades, customization, a wide variety of available side missions and a well written story makes Sleeping Dogs one of the best open world games I've ever played. If you like these kinds of games, I suggest you pick this one up whenever you can.You take the role of an undercover cop with a history of violence who is given the task of destroying the Triad from the inside-out. However as the story progresses things go from just business to personal matters. The story is really down-to-earth, and the characters are relatable enough to get the full enjoyment out of the missions.Even after finishing the game there is plenty of things left to do. Buy new clothes, max your upgrades, participate in street races, or even go sing karaoke. Hong Kong is your playground.The melee combat is what really sold me on this game. The ability to string together my own combos, learn new moves, and even use the environment was a refreshing change from the usual run-and-gun gameplay open world games seem to lean towards.A fantastic game all around. I'll definitely start a second playthough.			",315,40,4,34,20,1,30

												Sleeping Dogs has never been a game at the top of my must play list, to me it was just another GTA clone. But with the latest Humble Bumble package that it was included with, I thought why not give it a go.I’m glad I did too, as its not at all what I expected. Yes its an open world sandbox game, but that’s pretty much where the similarity’s end. In Sleeping Dogs you wont find yourself taking on hundreds of police witha machine gun and RPG, you wont be stealing cars constantly ether. Sleeping Dogs is very much a re-imagining of the genre.Sleeping Dogs puts you in the role of an undercover cop trying to rather successfully infiltrate the triads, the twist being your never completely sure that he hasn’t turned. The character grew up inthe neighborhood and many of your missions involve people he grew up with. It adds an interesting layer to the story, your not just finding out about other characters but also yourself. The Hong Kong that Sleeping Dogs puts you in is not the biggest map out there but its densely populated and really gives the impression of a living breathing city. A lot of work has gone into it and itreally shows, the best example being the night market that you spend much of the start of the game in. People browse the stalls, have conversations, interact with each other and you. At times its easy to forget your missionand get drawn into it all.The missions are good, they make you feel like your watching a gangster film. That’s probably because you’ll spot many elements taken from such films. But I’m not complaining about that, there wellput together and flow. The side missions tend to vary from the average too, instead of for instance taxi missions or pimp missions like the other big titles you will be doing favors for people. These favors couldbe doing free running or stopping a thief and even singing karaoke. But there are racing missions and fight clubs like most sandbox’s. Sleeping Dogs offers the player an upgrade system that’s quite unique too, there are three areas to upgrade. The first is Triad, the experience for this skill are earned through doing triad missionsand criminal acts. The second is Police where the reverse is true, this makes the player walk a tightrope of sorts trying to stay clean while being a criminal. The last skill is Face, this is increased by improving peoplesview of you through favors and such. Its also worth noting though not a skill per-say you can also improve your fighting skills through finding lost Jade statues for the local gym owner.And talking of the fighting, Sleeping Dogs does a great job with this, I’ve hear some compare it to the Arkham games but I disagree. The combat is far more methodical and slower paced. If you go in throwing punches willy nilly the game will punish you, you’ll find yourself waiting for counters and then throwing a few attacks in and back to waiting again. This might sound boring, but when playing its very inviting and seems to fit the whole style of the game well.This game try’s hard to be different from the rest, it succeeds well too. You can steal a car, but you can’t keep it. Your garage is for purchased cars only. You can use guns, but only carry handgun concealed and most of the time you will be using hand to hand combat. The game feels fresh and new, but its not perfect by any means.My one biggest gripe with this title is the driving, now its not terrible by any means but feels stiff and not natural. Its certainly better than some games I’ve played, but its not really fun its functional.The controls could be laid out better and the ability to jump from car to car seems out of place. But its not a huge issue and shouldn’t put you off playing it. The other issue is the camera, the camera seems to go crazy when reversing a car. It puts it self in some of the least helpfull possisions. But thankfully you probably wont be reversing too much so it shouldn’t give you too much trouble.See full review here http://cyberusuk.com/2015/02/25/sleeping-dogs-review-should-you-let-it-lie/ ",188,33,5,26,15,1,16

												This review is for the original version + all the DLC. There will not be any spoilers. Tl;dr at the bottom.So after completing Sleeping Dogs on the Xbox 360 I decided to pick it up for the PC. When I heard the review about the definitive edition I decided it would be best to trade for the complete collection instead, and I have no regrets. The game runs smooth on my pc, probably 50-60 frames when it's raining with the high resolution texture pack. Speaking of graphics the game's visuals are greatly improved making it a pleasure to look at. Just seeing the glowing neon signs popping out everwhere gives this game a certain charm only Deus Ex: Human Revolution (One of my favorite games despite me not even getting to the first boss.) could give me. It's basically eye candy for you neon fans out there. Sleeping Dogs is more of a game that you drive around and look at, but that doesn't mean that the gameplay isn't great. Taking its fighting from the Batman series may be boring in most cases, but in Sleeping Dogs the combat animations make fighting a lot more interesting than other Batman combat clones. For the DLC, I've been enjoying the cop missions as well as the story. Speaking of the story I think it's well executed for its theme, but I won't go into detail since it's best just to play it for yourself. The DLC is looking good so far, but for new players I wouldn't pick up the Gold + Silver pack because it raises you to almost the end-game stats. I would only recommend getting those two packs if you're done/almost done with the game. There is a lot of DLC, too. 24 packs to be exact, but I've enjoyed all of it so far. The outfits are designed very well and the new cars are interesting to look at and fun to drive. I haven't played the DLC missions yet though, but I'm guessing that they're going to be fun based on everything I've seen so far.tl;dr With the striking new visuals (for an xbox 360 user), great performance, and fun Batman combat I'd recommend anyone that played the 360 version or haven't even played the game yet to get your hands on the original + DLC. You won't be dissapointed and it's far from just another Grand Theft Auto clone.			",128,4,2,4,11,3,21

												What can i say,i thought this was just going to be another generic grand theft auto / saints row style open world car stealing and gangland killing game, but this has a lot more depth to it.as an undercover cop, you're simultaneously performing legit missions to raise your police officer ranking and skills, and at the same time undertaking shadier and shadier missions for the gangs to raise your rep and gain deeper access to the criminal world.the driving mechanics are solid, with a range of vehicles and motor bikes to pick up.highlight for me is the melee fighting mechanic though, it's great how you can actually perform differenet moves, interrupts, locks, throws, and use the environment to take down enemies.surprising one! highly recommended.

												Anyone who loves sandbox games, or the Grand Theft Auto series will absolutely love this game. If not, this will be one of those exceptions. You play as Wei Chen, a cop who tries to infultrate the most dangerous gangs in Hong Kong, all whilst trying to stay under cover. The story is set in a beautiful city environment loosely based around Hong Kong. The scenery is fantastic, and there are mods available in the steam workshop to make it even more visually stunning. In addition to that, the story is gripping and the combat system is superb. Within a couple of fights, you've got the hang of fighting for the rest of the game. It develops well, and more complex moves are added when you collect more of the missing statues. The only complaint that I have, is the fact that I completed the main story a little too quickly. A few more missions or added characters or scenes would have been brilliant. However, even after completing it, I still play the game as there are plenty of little odd jobs here and there to do.When this game is going cheap (maybe during the steam sales!) I would say:GRAB IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN. It'll be one of the best games you buy, I can tell you it certainly is one of mine.			",75,9,1,3,13,1,5

												First of all, THANK YOU SQUARE ENIX. Sleeping Dogs is without a doubt one of the most entertaining games I have played this year. Gameplay is flawless. Feels somewhat awkward at first but it's something the player adapts to overtime. Not surprised to see vehicles control the same way as they did in past True Crime games. Music is fantastic. Great assortment of radio channels. Fighting is a major step-up from past TC games despite the inability to learn different martial art styles. Plenty of skills to learn. Love every moment of it. Same applies to gun fights. Story is action packed and very immersive. Definitely lives up to past True Crime games. Campaign alone is roughly 10-15 hrs, but you can easily squeeze out over 50hrs with collectables, side missions, fight club, racing, chicken fights (soooo good), hacking cameras, dating, and loads more. Overall a brilliant title packed full of great content. Sleeping Dogs 2. Make it happen Square Enix, since Activision can't be bothered.			",253,51,12,14,17,3,32

												Sleeping Dogs has never been a game at the top of my must play list, to me it was just another GTA clone. But with the latest Humble Bumble package that it was included with, I thought why not give it a go.I’m glad I did too, as its not at all what I expected. Yes its an open world sandbox game, but that’s pretty much where the similarity’s end. In Sleeping Dogs you wont find yourself taking on hundreds of police witha machine gun and RPG, you wont be stealing cars constantly ether. Sleeping Dogs is very much a re-imagining of the genre.Sleeping Dogs puts you in the role of an undercover cop trying to rather successfully infiltrate the triads, the twist being your never completely sure that he hasn’t turned. The character grew up inthe neighborhood and many of your missions involve people he grew up with. It adds an interesting layer to the story, your not just finding out about other characters but also yourself. The Hong Kong that Sleeping Dogs puts you in is not the biggest map out there but its densely populated and really gives the impression of a living breathing city. A lot of work has gone into it and itreally shows, the best example being the night market that you spend much of the start of the game in. People browse the stalls, have conversations, interact with each other and you. At times its easy to forget your missionand get drawn into it all.The missions are good, they make you feel like your watching a gangster film. That’s probably because you’ll spot many elements taken from such films. But I’m not complaining about that, there wellput together and flow. The side missions tend to vary from the average too, instead of for instance taxi missions or pimp missions like the other big titles you will be doing favors for people. These favors couldbe doing free running or stopping a thief and even singing karaoke. But there are racing missions and fight clubs like most sandbox’s. Sleeping Dogs offers the player an upgrade system that’s quite unique too, there are three areas to upgrade. The first is Triad, the experience for this skill are earned through doing triad missionsand criminal acts. The second is Police where the reverse is true, this makes the player walk a tightrope of sorts trying to stay clean while being a criminal. The last skill is Face, this is increased by improving peoplesview of you through favors and such. Its also worth noting though not a skill per-say you can also improve your fighting skills through finding lost Jade statues for the local gym owner.And talking of the fighting, Sleeping Dogs does a great job with this, I’ve hear some compare it to the Arkham games but I disagree. The combat is far more methodical and slower paced. If you go in throwing punches willy nilly the game will punish you, you’ll find yourself waiting for counters and then throwing a few attacks in and back to waiting again. This might sound boring, but when playing its very inviting and seems to fit the whole style of the game well.This game try’s hard to be different from the rest, it succeeds well too. You can steal a car, but you can’t keep it. Your garage is for purchased cars only. You can use guns, but only carry handgun concealed and most of the time you will be using hand to hand combat. The game feels fresh and new, but its not perfect by any means.My one biggest gripe with this title is the driving, now its not terrible by any means but feels stiff and not natural. Its certainly better than some games I’ve played, but its not really fun its functional.The controls could be laid out better and the ability to jump from car to car seems out of place. But its not a huge issue and shouldn’t put you off playing it. The other issue is the camera, the camera seems to go crazy when reversing a car. It puts it self in some of the least helpfull possisions. But thankfully you probably wont be reversing too much so it shouldn’t give you too much trouble.See full review here http://cyberusuk.com/2015/02/25/sleeping-dogs-review-should-you-let-it-lie/ ",188,33,5,26,15,1,16

Character stories and the comedy is quite nice. Controls are a bit dodgy and the camera needs some work, but overall I give it an A-.			",81,86,1,29,14,2,29

DLCs are not that important, except if you really like the game and you want the last crazy suit giving you +5% running speed or whatever.The game takes something like 20 hours to end if you just follow the principal quest, which I think is correct, but I'd have enjoyed more Secondary quest and a more ""random"" open world. Indeed you have (some, not much) mods that you can install I think, but it's not really some important modes.I don't personally love the fight system, but I think it's ok considering it's a pretty casual game.Indeed, I recommand this game.

												Sleeping Dogs a game that could almost knock Grand theft auto of its throne. With its location and style  this game signifigantly brings a new feel to the open world genre having almost 90+ hours smashed into the game and finishing the main story. I feel this game is seriously alot of fun with the use of martial arts in the game is something diffrent for me as I have never played a Batman game but getting into it the game is amazing even gun play works great. You only get introduced to guns in the last 30% of the story but onces its in it feels rewarding having both in the game. This game is also a amazing PC port they suprisingly went into detail with graphics options heck! they even released a HD texture pack making the game more beautiful if you truly want this game to reach its peak for beatifulness I recommend the shader mod for this game with the HD texture pack trust me it makes the game top notch for a 2012 game. If you want a truly amazing openworld,beat em up,racing game I recommend this game to you.			",80,3,0,4,3,1,1

												A surprisingly engaging story.  The open world aspects are very interesting and engaging.  The world really seems alive, and the graphics really come alive at night when the rain is coming down.  The combat was great as well, and there was plenty to do even outside of the main storyline.  If you can grab the updated version with additional content and upgraded graphics, it'll be even better.			",226,64,3,66,10,0,11

Also the plot and storyline of the game is really good. The characters, dialogue, and voice acting is phenomenal! The action, stunts, fighting, and gun fighting are awesome! I definitely recommend this game to any who is interested in a really good story/open world free roam game! :)			",558,147,3,26,16,4,3

												This game earned to right to be called a classical.The story is envolving (which is damn rare for me) and will create a connection between the characters.It reminds alot of Shenmue (imo a good thing). Gives you alot of options within the idea of the game. The constant switching of quests between good and bad keeps the game interesting. Love the sidequests and smaller stuff you can do to customize and improve your character.The only negative side, is the fact that, you either get the DLCs before finishing the game or you probably will have a wierd feeling of ""not enough"" from the DLCs... since they dont deliver a mix of all the elements seen in the game. meaning you wont get to play undercover cop and a cop at the same time... it will either be 1 or the other or something entirely different.

												This game is amazing!Wei Shen is a badass giving off the feeling the he's a modern Bruce Lee, but with cursing involved.The fighting style and combat system in simplified, yet entertaining by the different combinations you can execute.There are also a subtle variations in enemies where you would have to make slight accomidations for to deal with them.The story is great so you will not be bored.  I won't spoil it though so you'll have to go through it yourself for you to decide.  The voice acting is spot on and fits with the characters that are being portrayed; it sounds great and everything feels alive in cantonese.Edit: They now made a Definitive Edition version of Sleeping Dogs which has all the DLC so you can only buy that now.8.5/10			",98,7,3,11,6,0,13

												The best game of 2012Sleeping dogs came in as a dark horse. Unlike many other games that were released in this period, this game did not get much pre-release press attention or hype. But when the game was released, it out performed the others.For last couple of years, almost all games followed the regular formula for maximum sales. There was nothing new or innovative. All of them featured awesome trailers and demos which makes you wanna play the game; but when you get the game, you realize that the game does not live up to your expectations.Sleeping dogs tried something different, something new. It tells the story of an undercover cop. Unlike many other games in this genre, it is not a run and shoot game. Its an open-world game and focuses mostly on hand-to-hand combat instead of gun-fights. The missions and story are pretty good; although I felt that the main story is a bit too short. The game's combat system deserves all the praises. Its a mix of melee combat in Batman and Assassins Creed Revelations. It features a decent free-running mechanism as well (not as splendid as in Assassins Creed).Side missions include Spying, hacking, looting, racing (typical GTA eh?). The vehicle mechanics in this game is done by programmers who previously worked in the legendary Need For Speed games. Apart from some occasional glitches, the game's engine is pretty neat. It has a decently realistic renderer(don't expect CryEngine here). However for PC gamers, to experience Hong-Kong (did I say the game is set in Hong-Kong?) in its full glory, you MUST download the High resolution Texture pack from steam - its FREE.So Sleeping Dogs = GTA + Saints Row (open world) with Batman (fighting) and Splinter Cell (hacking and things like that) and Assassins Creed (free-running)Should you play this game? Absolutely YES			",214,19,16,14,5,0,14

												Although the game emphasizes melee combat over gunplay, the shootouts are fun enough and there's enough variety in the story missions and side missions. It is a crime drama in an open world that encourages plenty of exploration. The voice acting is convincing and effective. If you want to find all the collectibles and upgrade Wei Shen's martial arts skills, you will have a great time playing this game for a long time. There are some problems with character animations looking unnatural and poor A.I. such as enemies running into walls and other objects, but the game is still worth playing.			",190,18,0,4,7,2,6

												This is easily one of the best open world games I have ever played combining the mechanics of various great games into one. The game takes place in Hong Kong and the main character is an undercover cop who works his way up in the gangs. The game has a lot of hand to hand combat reminding me a lot of Batman Arkham Asylum with a very smooth feeling in it. There is also some gunplay which while feeling pretty good, does not work well on mouse and keyboard due to the way the controls are done. You have to hold the shift key in order to zoom in and that just feels terrible. The right mouse button is already taken up by interact and counter so this leaves the shift key or you need to work something else out. Since there is also a lot of driving in this game, I would recommend you just use an Xbox 360 controller to play this game. The graphics and sound in this game are really nice. The game does not support XP due to use of DX11 features and the game looks really nice with them enabled. The game will last about 8+ hours for the main story but 100% completion will take a lot longer. I preferred this game over Grand Theft Auto IV and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good sandbox action game. 90/100			",646,136,23,81,50,5,98

												I'm struggling to put my finger on exactly why I like Sleeping Dogs so much. It's your favourite GTA game, only pared down, de-fluffed and condensed. Combat is about diving into groups of enemies and turning into a melee-powered arm-breaking knee-snapping force of nature - guns are used to escalate situations, not resolve them. You're a cop! - and so your actions are judged appropriately while playing a mission. Likewise, you're infiltrating the Triads - so you're scored for being ruthless.There's not an awful lot to do outside of the main storyline, but who cares? Cruising around fictional Hong Kong is enjoyable in itself, and by the time you've finished the story you've pretty much seen all there is to see in the game anyway.No cruft, no gimmicks, no eye-rolling social commentary: just an enjoyable crime story set in Hong Kong, with an open-world game as the way it's told. ...and pork bun. Lots of pork bun.			",178,45,3,12,11,1,19

Gives you alot of options within the idea of the game. The constant switching of quests between good and bad keeps the game interesting. Love the sidequests and smaller stuff you can do to customize and improve your character.The only negative side, is the fact that, you either get the DLCs before finishing the game or you probably will have a wierd feeling of ""not enough"" from the DLCs... since they dont deliver a mix of all the elements seen in the game. meaning you wont get to play undercover cop and a cop at the same time... it will either be 1 or the other or something entirely different.

												Engaging plot, controls were simple to pick up and the environment was authentic.I think that there were missed opportunities to expand on the storyline and extra activities could have been included.Definitely worth trying out, I’d give it a solid 8 out of 10.			",280,57,11,23,23,5,29

												Awesome game, I rate it better than GTA 5. Great combat, great gang story, great voice overs. It was like watching an awesome movie. Kind of reminds me of the Yakuza games in a way. Plenty of character depth and fighting moves to learn. The car driving is more arcadey, but it doesn't detract from the overall gameplay. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												hello guys, my name is dako. i want to like to compare this game with GTA but on the other hand yu cant compare this with gta. because it is a diffrerent game. surely, it includes the concept of an open world environment game. but, it seems like square enix didnt put much effort in this game like rockstar in GTA. i had a lot of fun playin the story. the city of hong kong is very atmospheric and good. the graphic of the modells and city are although very nice. the story itself is a little bit easy to predict. nothing special. undercover cop tries to arrest the head of the triads and get a lot of trouble in the end. The Missions are ok and nice to play. Sometimes a little bit weird because of nonsense but ok. the control is very uncomfortable because they emulated the console control to a keyboard- mouse control. you have to work urself through this mess. overall you will have fun. if u like to play at least 12 hours of good missions in an visually nice city u cant do anything wrong. if u like to hunt additionally some achievments and reach a playtime of 20 hrs u cant do anything wrong. i purchased this game for 7,5€, no reason to pay more. pros: - nice graphics- nice atmosphere- nice  combat system- a lot of different ways to play this game - somtimes funny / good humor cons:- a little bit tooooo  easy- sidequests are sometimes boring- its not possible to buy weapons- some bugs / glitchesis good in its own way but no comparison with GTA 4.

												4.7/5 Absolutely Recommended.AestheticsGraphics: There are many graphics settings which is good for those without super good computers.Sound: The sound quality is fine, voice acting is good.Gameplay Plot: The game is set in Hong Kong, a unique setting unlike most cliche open-world games.You are an undercover cop and you get the best of both worlds being a triad member you work your way up the hierarchy of the triad gang and get better skills for both sides. Combat: Versatile and extremely enjoyable. You can do kung fu moves, smash people's heads in, grab them and throw them off of a building roof, and many more things. Driving: Pretty average for your open-world action game.Length: The game is a bit short. It took me about 25 hours to beat it. It will take you about 20-30 hours to beat the game depending on how many events you do and how often you do the main story missions.Open-world Events: The events in this game are quite different from any other games. You can fight in a fight club, do races around the city, bet in cockfights, bust drug deals around the city, do various favors for characters around the city to increase your Face level, and more. Not to mention the lockboxes and health shrines placed all around the city. Lockboxes are pretty much chests filled with money and sometimes rare clothing. Health shrines increase your maximum health after you find a certain amount in each city.Immersion: The game is extremely immersive. The developers did a very good job of capturing the essence of Hong Kong, or at least our perception of it with the sounds of lots of yelling, street vendors, night markets, and generally the Cantonese language. The radio plays good songs that you would expect to hear in a car.CustomizationHere are the individual things to customize about your character:HatTorsoPantsShoesWatchBraceletSome item sets give your character added perks such as dealing more melee damage or being more sneaky around cops.You can also unlock preset outfits by playing the game.ConclusionYou can't go wrong if you buy this game. If you are into free-roam action games with a good plot, I definitely recommend that you buy this game, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed.			",64,1,0,5,2,1,2

												I have to say honestly, Sleeping Dogs is probrably my most favorite open world game so far! :)There are many areas of the city and outside of the city you can explore and free roam! Also the plot and storyline of the game is really good. The characters, dialogue, and voice acting is phenomenal! The action, stunts, fighting, and gun fighting are awesome! I definitely recommend this game to any who is interested in a really good story/open world free roam game! :)			",558,147,3,26,16,4,3

												Hand to hand combat is clunky, unresponsive, and frustrating. The camera when driving is one of the worst I've ever seen. But here's me still playing the game because the writing and atmosphere is excellent.  Shame about the control mechanics though. Solid B, I guess.			",225,75,4,60,21,1,22

												The commoradory among Cantonese gangsters is incredibly reminescent of all the HK movies I have seen growning up.  The thugs, the bosses, the violence, and the tragedy, Sleeping Dogs has an amazing script if you enjoy a good Chinese gangster movie, a solid combat and leveling system, and wacky wacky open world antics.I really enjoyed this game.

												Simply put, this is the game I always wanted GTA to be. This game is incredible. The city is great, the combat is great, the story is great. Even the obligatory costume DLCs are actually pretty great. Just don't buy the dumb shortcut DLCs with this game as it will probably spoil your progression. And, man, the weather effects. A real gem, and something I think people would easily pass up.			",737,297,35,127,101,9,165

												This game could be summed up in ""GTA with Triads"". And that's a great thing.First because Hong Kong and the Chinese gangster scene isn't a properly explored field in gaming as a whole. So you have a rich universe, deep characters and an immersive, breathing city, all wrapped up in gorgeous art direction and graphics and nice gameplay.I won't write about the plot, because in my opinion, the impact and involvement is always stronger when you arrive unbiased. But I can say the story develops as a good Chinese cop movie, with nods to 70's grindhouse flicks and even B-movies here and there.You have a huge city to explore, on foot or using one out of a crapload of vehicles at your disposal (one way or another). You have tons of stuff to do other than the story missions (favors, jobs, collectibles, events, fight clubs, street races, collectibles, challenges among your friends via Social Hub... did I say collectibles?). A very nice experience for the regular OCD gamer.The game focuses on fighting instead of gun firing, and I also liked this a lot. Dozens of bone-breaking, spine-chilling ultraviolent moves to beat the heck out of bad guys. Then you jump in a car and engage into an action movie chase, driving with one hand and shooting enemies' tires with the other. Explosions and slow motions abound. Situations like this are common.One thing that caught my attention is the missions never get repetitive. Or at least they don't look as much. Even if you're using the same mechanics, you're always doing different stuff. There's the obligatory fetch quests. You scare people who don't pay your boss. You take your girlfriend for a stroll. You hijack armored trucks. You hack cameras, pick locks, plant bugs. You break into a guy's house to mess with his Feng Shui. There's even a mission where you must sing horribly in karaoke, on purpose, to help a guy convince his girlfriend to leave the place. How 'bout that?The voice acting is very good, and the vehicles you take give access to several radios of different styles of music, from 80s pop to hard rock, cheesy Asian tunes and even classical. Nothing compares to find yourself running away from the police while listening to Debussy's Clair de Lune.I played this via Big Picture with a 360 controller and the experience was pretty tight. I had no technical problems.Had good laughs with this game. And ""Holeee sheet"" moments, and edge-of-seat moments, and ""In yo face punk!"" moments. So I highly recommed this game and the extra DLC chapters (Zodiac Tournament, Year of the Snake, Nightmare), which are also tons of fun.			",856,540,35,95,55,10,92
