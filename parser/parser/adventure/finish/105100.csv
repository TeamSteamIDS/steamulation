												This is a charming game, however there are a few issues that are a bit breaking and after seeing that it costs 6.99€ just makes me say DO NOT BUY IT. If you do find it in a bundle however (like I did) sure, get it.Now it's time for an explanation. The game is cute and your character actually walks around ""real"" objects, as in, the scenes were filmed with a real camera and then blended into the game.It's a point and click puzzle game and it isn't an easy one either. Which, again, in itself is fine.The puzzles are usually either a bit easy to solve or at least to figure out what to do, but there's 1 of them that is really quite horribly difficult to even make sense out of it.SPOILER about that ""tip"" for that puzzle, it's a page of a book with the ""ONE"" in ""GRAMAPHONE"" underlined, and a #9 on the corner of the page... what this supposedly means is, there's 9 numbers you need (for a locker with 3 digits, therefore 3 sets) and it starts with ONE, then you have to read the text and find either the actuall number like ""fig. 2"" being the ""2"" the second number you need, and then ""three""... then there's a year, 1887, the ""1"" is the last number of the second set of numbers and ""887"" the last one.The problem with this is, the game gives you NO CLUE what this book is related to or even what to look for, your character only says ""A book grandpa's been reading, he wrote something on it"" and that's it, you really need a guide or an epiphany to figure it out.Lastly, and this is what made me say NO about buying this for 6,99€ is that the game... only lasted me a few minutes, seriously, there are like 5 different screens (not counting small camera transitions) and only a dozen of puzzles or so, it's a cute short ""story"" but it's not even an apetizer, sure, in the end it says ""end of lume part 1"", but it's a part where you pay 6,99€ to get.TL;DR- One of the puzzles is nearly impossible to solve on your own, and crucial to finish the game;- Even if you get stuck a lot, you can beat the game in only a few minutes, not even 1 hour.Would I recommend playing this game? Sure, it is a bit fun at most and challenging, you will probably need a guide for 1 or 2 puzzles though and it's an interesting new concept.Would I recommend buying this game? No, unless you're either filthy rich, or get it with a bundle, seriously.In terms of the overall game and enjoyability I give it a... maybe 8/10 (without my puzzle issue).In terms of the price/quality ratio I give it a 1/10 just because it's visually pleasing and new.Thanks for reading this (if anyone ever does).

												Your grandfather has gone missing and you need to solve fiendish puzzles with cryptic clues left behind by a madman. The only hope you have of seeing your grandfather again is to solve these puzzles and get the power working again. Lume is a point and click puzzle game. Each puzzle is masterfully done, adding layer upon layer. Its not just typical puzzles, but these are puzzles are off kilter. A is E, a triangle is 3, north is north east sort of off kilter. There are cryptic clues are everywhere. You'll get an inventory of parts to create a power generator and see your grandfather alive.The truth is that you play as a child and your grandfather has gone to go investigate something. So he left clues for you to get his power up and running again. He's the madman. There is no threat, danger or game over. There is a variety of puzzles. Everything from lock combinations, to spinning wired tiles to connect all circuits. The clues for the most part will be in select pages of books and following instructions meant to get you lost with irrelevance. It is all a brain teaser's dream.The game itself looks unique, because it looks as if someone made it with construction paper. Then filmed transitions between environments. The real downfall about the art is the resolution is stuck low so its a small screen with a giant dark frame. With such a unique art style, it should be a higher resolution to bask in its glory.  There aren't many environments. Just a three interiors, two closets and an exterior consisting of two screens.The controls are simple, just click things. Since it is a Flash game, just hover your mouse over something and the cursor will change to a pointer. Your inventory is easy to get to at the top of the screen instead of completely switching to an inventory.At the end of the hour or two game, you find out this is just Episode 1. These were some difficult puzzles, but without the unique art style it would have gotten lost in the shuffle.			",1126,324,51,104,96,15,167

												I wasn't sure whether or not to recommend this game. In the end, I decided to recommend it. Why? Because even though it was extemely short, it was heaps of fun and quite challenging.Pros:- Visually pleasing - very nice art which looks like a lot of effort has been put into it.- Unique puzzles.- Pleasant music.- Interesting and fun gameplay.Cons- Extemely short - felt more like a demo than an actual game.- Overpriced - very expensive for what you get. Get it while it's on sale.If you like point and click puzzle adventure games, I would recommend that you buy this. However, it is not worth it at full price, so I would say wait for it to go on sale. :)			",255,115,15,22,30,2,34

Short version: 53%Not even the imaginative art style and the fun (albeit vague) puzzles can mask the sad truth is that Lume is nothing more but a half-hour demo with a hefty price tag for its length. And a game that makes me wish for a ‘neutral’ button…Long version:Lume is very short puzzle game– filmed entirely in a small paper and cardboard house– about a little girl called Lumi, whose task is to solve the puzzles left by his handyman grandfather.This Flash game is so short that feels like as if it should be a free demo on some web site, not something that costs the current price. Especially since it has about half dozen puzzles in total; if they had in-game instructions and if one wouldn’t require a randomly appearing hint, the entire game wouldn’t last twenty minutes.Sure, we are treated with a very creative and fun visual style during that time, but in the end Lume feels like a very pricy demo version of the incredibly superior sequel, Lumino City.

												Lume is a small point-and-click adventure where your task is to restore power to your grandfather's home.The game is light and fun. If you like games like Machinarium and Botanicula, you'll like this. The only downfall of the game is it's length. It's incredibly short. I think I completed this game within an hour, which, for a game with no replayability and a cost of £4.99, is a little disappointing.However, that doesn't mean the game isn't good. It is, it's enjoyable with some unique puzzling. But, I would say, if you're looking to get the game, wait til it's on sale.-Nilesy			",313,139,3,47,47,5,46

												I thought i would re-play and re-review this before i start the sequel to this game ""Lumino City"".This is a nice little point and click adventure game with a beautiful visual style and interesting puzzles. Although, with that said, it's very important to mention that this is almost an introduction/demo into the world and the style of the game. This would definitely not pass as a full length game. I am yet to play Lumino City, it has great reviews and i'm willing to bet that you skipping ""Lume"" before going straight to that would be of no loss to you. I first played this a while ago and i can say that it was definitely a disappointment as a game at the time. I was very impressed with aspects of the game but it's barely an hours worth of gameplay, it has no real story and as pretty as it is, it isn't worth the price. I would only recommend buying this if you can get it really cheap or even just free. The only reason i have come back to it was to remind me of the world, style and the setting before i started on the sequel. As a stand alone game It's definitely not something i would recommend.However, as a ""taster"" of sorts for the next game, my short time in this game did definitely manage to grab my interest once i found out a full length game was being released as a sequel. The art style of the game is wonderful. A hand-made, miniature model, stop-motion and animation mix of a game. I love the extra care and attention that are put into these sorts of games. It does really manage to make them unique. The game is made to feel very homely and cozy with this kind of technique and creates a warm and relaxing feeling. The puzzles were fun and quite interesting. There was one that was kind of hard to find the logic behind without resorting to a guide, but that was the only one I had trouble with. The others were interesting but do-able. I hope to see more puzzles like these in the next one.As it goes, i think i will have to down-vote this game on the basis of it being a stand alone game.But with that said, i am looking forward to writing a very positive (hopefully) review of it's sequel.All in all, It's decent for a demo or taster, but not as a game. Play it if you can get it free or just really cheap. Otherwise, just take a look at the sequel instead.TL;DR : Just buy Lumino City. ",421,281,31,20,33,5,36

												A not-so-complete review for a not-so-complete game. So bulletpoints: The game is as bad as it's beautiful. Puzzles are either ridiculously easy, or stupidly and insanely hard. Most of them don't make sense. You just get loose clues and have to aimlessly try things out until you get it right. I checked a guide and I'm glad I did. I doubt there was any playtesting. Pro: fits the purpose of teaching people how not to design a point-and-click adventure game. Low res, making the text really hard to read. It's VERY short. Still I feel like I've wasted my time. Cheap and still overpriced. I got it from TG for 195 coins and I regret it.DON'T BUY IT! If you already have it, DON'T BOTHER PLAYING IT!			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

												If you want to try this game, I would suggest you to skip this and go straight for ""Lumino City"".Lume feels like it's but only a short demo for ""Lumino City"".The art style is no doubt a great beauty but...definitely over priced for such a short and incomplete game.(My play time is 2.5 hrs due to save file problems)My save file disappeared and I had to replay from scratch. This appears to be a common problem posted in the forums.(Seems to be related to clearing browser cache)But no warning or patch was done, left with only the solution of finishing it in one sitting.(which isn't too bad as the game is very short)The puzzles aren't that hard but a couple are pretty darn confusing.I've spent more time being confused than actually solving those two.They have some of the most confusing hints I had ever seen.

												First off: this is a game about the aesthetic. The hand-made set and camera moves makes this game among the prettiest I've ever played. It's also super short, serving as a taster for the upcoming Lumino City, made in the same handcrafted way - I personally can't wait to explore a bigger world that's this beautiful.Niggles:- It sucks that the resolution is so low. It takes away from the awesomeness of the visuals, which is what the game's about in the first place.- The puzzles aren't that clever or anything. But it's a point and click, so what can one expect.It's cheap. It's beautiful. Buy it.			",461,158,10,37,30,7,51

If you love point and clicks with great artwork like I do, then you'll find this game to be just ok. Instead of this game, I would recommend the game ""Tiny Bang Story"".

												while i enjoyed lume, i would have trouble paying money for it.the art style and animations are excellent, and i could happily spend some time in the world of lume.  while it would have been nice to add a what-am-i-looking-at indication somewhere other than the cursor changing to a hand when you can interact with something, the interface was easy to use and never really got in the way.the main problem is there just isn’t enough here.  it’s probably over in about an hour, depending on how much you’re able to think the way the game designer did.  if you didn’t figure out a clue, you pretty much need to look up a walkthrough because there’s only one clue for each puzzle.  a lot of the puzzles feel like they’re trying to teach you simple math, which feels like maybe it’s intended for children but at the same time is probably too difficult for that.  the music loop is a little short and it’s written in flash which means right-click brings up a flash menu instead of having anything to do with the game.  it had big black borders on my screen instead of stretching to fit.it’s worth your time if you pick it up as part of a bundle, but i wouldn’t recommend it on its own.

												It pains me to say it, but as charming as Lume is, it doesn’t offer much else to back it up.Looking back, it probably didn’t help that I played it just after Machinarium, For one, apart from one particularly obscure solution, Lume’s puzzles are rather simple.But I think what really ruins it is how short it is. I finished it in an hour, and that’s because I played around a bit. I can certainly tolerate short games, but Lume doesn’t really have much going for it to compensate being so short. Even weirder is that it’s supposed to be episode 1 of a series, which not only was never released, but makes you wonder why they chose to make it episodic in the first place.Now, the game has pretty visuals, really pretty indeed, and if you want to see that yourself, wait for a sale. But really, if you’re just looking for an adventure game to play, pick another one, Lume is light on content and will probably disappoint you.			",61,37,0,15,10,0,12

												Back in 2011, this flash game was really interesting but short, I remember getting it free somewhere. It was a cool 15 minutes long game, with some small minigames and little to no plot, It was promising but - over the years those devs made 3 other games and no continuation for this one, obviously this means that this is a complete project, abandoned by devs.This game is very overpriced for what it is, even when you start the game and press ESC you can see that flashplayer lol.You can see awards on the games page claiming it's the finalist of best games of 2011, but this game only can get its prize in the best DEMOs of 2011 I guess.

On the other hand, the only positive thing I can think of is that the artwork/animations are astonishing yet so simple, which made me want to try out this game in the first place.

												Alright, let's talk a little bit about Lume. To give a short answer: do I recommend that you purchase it? No - go pick up Lumino City instead. It's the fully fleshed-out version of what the developers were more-or-less experimenting with here. It's absolutely beautiful, and I would recommend it in a heartbeat. For most people, that's probably all you need to know. So go check out Lumino City.If you're still reading, here's some slightly more in-depth thoughts. Lume is effectively an early experiment for what would become Lumino City. Here, State of Play got a good sense for how this ""animating on top of a paper world"" idea could work for a fully-fledged game. That being said, this is not that game. It is very short, there isn't much of a story developed, and some of the puzzles are not presented in a way that gives the player any clues as to how to find the solution. It is very much the little brother of Lumino City. It's clear that the team had dreams of larger environments and a bigger story, and some of the puzzles (the wiring and the music lock) were improved upon and included in the larger game. And of course, they used Lume to experiment with this fantastic art style. Basically, Lume serves as a historical artifact of how Lumino City evolved from an idea into the amazing game it is. So here's my recommendation: Go play Lumino City. If you enjoy it (and I think you will) and are interested in seeing how it came to be, pick up Lume when it's on sale for $1-2. But you have to come at it knowing that this isn't some astounding game, but a stepping stone towards one.			",110,59,2,4,22,2,12

												This game is just... what?I'm happy i didn't buy it for original price.Too much information, too little playing, they just give you key to puzzles, but makes it difficult by imprecission and i really don't like this type of puzzles.... i played much adventures, but this one is one of theese bad.Graphics are something between 2D and 3D, making the final effect... ...weird and chaotic and the resolution is just... too small. If you wanna spend your money, this isn't best choice			",134,44,3,33,11,1,42

												I bought this at 70% off, and I still feel ripped off.It's cute. The graphics are pretty and charming. It makes a nice set-up to a bigger story. That's pretty much everything positive I have to say about it.Half the puzzles I liked, but the triple combination lock stuck out as too illogically-placed - the clue to solve it is buried elsewhere in the house, and didn't occur to me that they were connected for a long time. The story was abrupt - you solve a number of puzzles to turn on the power in your house...and that's it. The trailer suggested to me that it's longer or more mysterious...but it's not.I'll admit  that the graphics and getting the game to run are difficult, and that's something I admire. But for something you can complete in under an hour, it isn't worth the value.			",50,39,0,31,33,0,13

												This game is so not worth its price! I really enjoy puzzle games but this one is extremely small.  If I'm not mistaken, this was part 1 and, overall, you can complete it very fast. It has a small amount of puzzles for you to do and I can't say they are very hard; the problem in my opinion, is that I feel the developers didn't provide enough or even helpful clues/info for one to complete the puzzles in a fast and easy way. I had a bit of a struggle with a few just because I couldn't find any logic in them whatsoever (I'm not the only person that feels this).As for the aspect of the game alone, it is very simple but it's still 'cute' for a flash game. However I don't feel it's appealing enough for one to spend 6,99€ on it. It almost felt as if I was playing a demo.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a nice game, but it's also waaaay too short.The setting is nice featuring a new and unique way to tell the story ... but the story ... well ... if you know what to do it lasts for maybe a fifteen minutes ... and that's if you're playing it slow ...When clicking through you can easily finish this in three minutes!Get only on a laaaaaarge discount to enjoy the unique feel, but don't expect to get much game out of it.And with laaaarge discount I mean don't pay more than 0.10 cent or so ...There are free flash games featuring longer lasting playability.

												I think I hated this game  so much because I actually loved it at first....  I thought the art was great and the little puzzel games were pretty good to start out with and then all of the sudden it ended.  There was nowhere else to go and no more puzzels to solve. It just ended before I felt like I had even gotten to the end of a level, let alone the end of a game.   So dissappointing for a game I started out thinking I was going to love.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As beautifully-made as it is short, Lume is wonderful if brain-destroyingly difficult at times. I actually had to look up a walkthrough for one of the puzzles, it got that difficult for me.I would still reccommend this wholeheartedly, ALMOST to the point of taking it upon myself to offer a money-back guarantee of enjoyment. But I won't do that because that's just dumb. And it's not my job. And this isn't my game. And I'm broke. But it's still a game that's worth your money, even if just to tide you over until Lumino City drops.			",549,360,11,60,76,2,52

												Lume - Paprastumo grožis [Apžvalga]Lume, tai yra mažas ""point-and-click"" nuotykių žaidimas, kuriame jūs valdote anūką, kurio užduotis senelio namuose atstatyti elektros energija. Žaidimas yra šviesus ir linksmas. Jis turi neįprastą, bet gražią vizualinę pusę kuri šiam žaidimui suteikia savotiškumo. Jei jums patiko tokie žaidimai, kaip Machinarium ar Botanicula jums be abejonės patiks ir šis žaidimas. Žaidime atvykstame aplankyti senai matytą senelį, bet mes jo nerandame namuose, o vietoj jo tik raštelį. Perskaitę raštelį sužinome, kad senelis susidūrė su elektros tiekimo problemomis, todėl nutarė pats išsiaiškinti kas nutiko. Ir tuo pačiu paliko mums pūzlęs(jų yra ~7) kurių pagalba, galėsime padėti seneliui. Ir nieko nedelsdami puolame ieškoti užuominų, bei spręsti užduotis!Vis dar galvojate, ką po velnių reiškia mano pasisakymas ""Paprastumo grožis"" ? Norint suprasti šį teiginį, grįžkime prie vizualinės žaidimo pusės. Žaidimas sukurtas iš popieriaus tikrąją tą žodžio prasme, žaidimo išvaizdos kūrimui buvo panaudotos popierinės konstrukcijos su šiek tiek kompiuterinės grafikos. O aplinkų perėjimai yra tiesiog nufilmuoti su vaizdo kamera, taigi tai yra labai paprasta bet ir tuo pačiu gražu ar ne ?Kad ir kaip būtų viskas gražu ir linksmą, žaidimas turi ir minusų. Tai yra istorijos ilgis, jis siekia vos 1h, tai gi visas žaidimo malonumas ir smagi atmosfera greitai išblėsta. Kaip be būtų, tai nereiškia kad žaidimas yra prastas, jis tikrai malonus ir linksmas, Žinant, kad žaidimo kaina siekia vos 5LT, jo trukmė tampa nebe tokia svarbi. Kurėjų teigimu šis žaidimas yra tik pirmoji dalis didelės istorijos, taigi belieka tikėtis, kad Lume antroji dalis bus ilgesnė :)7/10 - Nuoroda į apžvalgą : http://www.games4you.lt/lt/naujienos?naujiena=7 ",976,312,73,133,141,14,221

												Lume is a visually stunning, very intresting and fun game. Though it's only part one, I got it as part of a Humble Bundle along with some other games, and I think it's very charming!The game is ""filmed"" on a beautifully-crafted set made out of cardboard and every detail got so much love put into it! Every piece of the set is hand-crafted (similar to IloMilo's cutscenes if you've played that) The characters Lume and her Grandfather move around on the set, but they don't look out of place.The only critiques I could give is that the puzzles are really difficult, and it's really short. Like ""I could knock this out in a lunchbreak if I wasn't stuck on this puzzle for twenty minutes"" kind of short. However, the puzzles can be solved eventually with a little focus and determination (all the pieces of the puzzles are there, though the key puzzle takes some trial and error), and this is only part one so I am still very much looking forward to more of Lume!

Dennch sin ein bis zwei Rätsel absolut nicht zu lösen! Also wirklich nicht zu lösen!

												Lume is a puzzle game with a very cool art style. The game's structure is simple: solve puzzles to find the components you need to power the house. The game's art is beautiful, and the sets were clearly filmed with an actual camera. The music also fits well with the game.The compliments end there, however. The puzzles are arcane, with no help. I solved the easier puzzles, but others give you frustratingly little info. One required interaction with an object I thought I'd interacted with already. Another assumes that turning around changes which direction ""northwest"" is, which is simply wrong. I got frustrated with those puzzles before finishing them.Lume is incredibly short. There are about 6 puzzles, then the game ends. If you look up the answers, or even hints, expect to finish the game in under an hour.If you like the art style, then maybe you can find more value in Lume than I did. If not, even if you like puzzle games, you should skip this one.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												This was one of the first games I bought here, and I don't regret it. This game is very short - only a Part 1 in what I assume is an impending series - but a fun point-and-click adventure with some pleasing riddles and puzzles to solve. Not to mention that ""gorgeous"" doesn't describe the way the game's set looks; I'm likely to replay it just to watch the camerawork, motion and scenery in action.As mentioned above, it is definitely a Part 1; the game is extremely short, and that should be taken under consideration upon purchase. However it's sequel, Lumino City, is out now. I look forward to grabbing it and adding my review to this one.			",222,77,4,62,15,3,37

												Lume is an interesting adventure game interspersed with very difficult puzzles.  Lume has a very unique graphic style and minimalist music style that is so innovative I can recommend it on that basis alone.  However the game suffers from being on a flash platform and lacking a custom cursor, making the pixel hunt portion of the experience a chore with the default pointer.  In addition, and inexplicably, the game does not support a true full screen mode and will be reduced to a tiny 800x600 frame in the middle of your screen.  Also unfortunately, the game does not support the Steam Overlay, so you won't be able to capture some of the beautiful graphics without some other third party solution.  Overall, I would recommend Lume to players who are looking for a very unique presentation, but don't mind fairly uninspired pixel hunt and puzzle gameplay.			",1052,329,48,158,114,10,216

												Saying that I recommend this game is somewhat misleading; I recommend you play it if you happen to pick it up with one of the Indie Bundles out there, but I wouldn't go forking out the money they ask for this otherwise. Worth £5 this is not. Very pretty game, yes. Has some potential in the realm of puzzlers, but the solutions to a couple of them are annoyingly obscure, to the point where it's out of sheer luck you figure them out. Game lasts up to an hour, but most of that is down to slow walking speed of the main character and going back and forth trying to work out what on earth you missed.The single-track soundtrack starts to get tiresome after a while, nice as it is.

OverviewSadistic in nature, by all means not even close to a puzzle, or adventuring game. I honestly can only think that the developer's face throughout making this game was one of a TROLLOLOLOL. I read through the guide after saying, ""nope!!!""What you'll need to complete this game without a guide:-Huge amount of time-Directional awareness in a circuitry trace diagram-Simplicity when it's required-Astute observation skill in observing the smallest clue  PLEASE, tell me how someone is supposed to know #9 means 9 numbers instead of being included/excluded in the solving of the puzzle? It is true that the puzzle only requires 9 numbers, but why would you include #9 to further confuse your players? Of course after they tried the 1st set of numbers they would realise something was wrong, but they wouldn't know what went wrong and head directly into a guide-Knowledge of Roman numerals  I have no idea whether the crosses are religious ones, or X which is another roman numeral, but somehow it's supposed to be 3 -Knowlegde of geometric shapes  count corners and indents [star is 10] -Knowledge of the fact that  6 with a line above * is 9? No idea where that came from -Knowledge of musical sheets-Knowledge of musical notes-Knowledge of mapping  A5, A8, G8, G10, J10, G10, G8, F8 ... can't see the instructions on guide, so I don't know how hard this one is. -Rest of game is then exploration and moving back and forth until completion.Why?-Short game with normal puzzles.-Small area-Not worth the money unless it's like 50¢ to $1 even better if it's in a humblebundle with games you actually want.-No Clues-Too much guide neccessity-Sadistic puzzles that either require a huge amount of time to solve[or luck] with nearly no clues, or very subtle ones.-No skipping of dialogue-You require too much help where none is given, so naturally you look at guides.Once finished with that puzzle and resolving to not look at the guide once again assuring yourself that it was merely a hard part...you encounter a second...more sadistic puzzle.Spoilers: The second puzzle, you'll be hitting yourself on because of how simple it was[Occam's razor], but the way the hint was given is complicated due to how various other things where written near the P.S. of the letter. I did realise that the letter did hold the key to solving opening the door, but was not sure how to translate them into numbers.#2:  Kicking yourself yet? AGA near the end of the letter is meant to be translated into numbers of the alphabet - 171The third puzzle encounter was even more difficult than the second as it was keys with 2 different colors, silver and copper, with varying heights, indents and the fact that they're TOO IDENTICAL TO ONE ANOTHER.  #3  counting from the top middle silver short key, select key #3, #8, #14 ... no idea how anyone figured that out other than trial and error.    14 keys, 3 needed, so 364 Combinations...I dearly hope that someone DID NOT spend that much time solving this puzzleFinal Thoughts:At this point...I thought, ""No, not even worth my time and read through the guide."" To which I confirmed my suspicious that the game was sadistically hard and not worth my time, whew.This is my honest opinion...I own and play a plethora of puzzlers, HOGs and adventure games where there are varying degrees of difficult puzzles, but none approach the difficulty of this unfriendly and anti-player game where you're required to have fore-knowledge of varying degrees in substantially different fields that do not relate to one another. I consider that a bad game, indeed. There is no sense of completion even if you have solved the hard puzzles on your own because of how long it took you to solve it, or you, like me, looked at a guide, which most would consider demoralising. I feel developers of this game would then laugh at you because you didn't know something so, ""simple.""^Read this twice before you think of commenting something idiotic and not worth engaging.

The reason for this was that I bought Lume via humble bundle for my gf she lost interest quickly and I shortly after got the sequal cheap thinking I'll play Lume when its cheap again.Well!I payed someting like 49p for it and all I can say is that I still feel completley ripped off.I feel so sorry for those who payed full price for a demo.Theres really no reason why this should even be here after the release of Lumino city.under no circumstance should you buy this, buy the actual game (lumino city) and leave this demo to rot!and yes 49p is nothing but I could have bought a cheap♥♥♥♥♥beer for that!

												I refuse to recommend this on the basis of how short it is for the price, but the game itself is not bad. Aside from one obscure puzzle it's fairly straightforward, the plot elements are kind of pointless and the game itself incedibly short (as of writing, at least, though there are more episodes promised?). Even then though the only real draw is the art style itself, the game itself is certainly very interesting to look at if nothing else. The one music track that repeats over and over would get more tedious if the game was longer, I suppose, but yeah, only one music track, enjoy. Like I said though, the game itself is fine except for its length, nothing spectacular and it's probably wiser to throw your money at better point and click adventure games either way, but for the price tag, no, don't even think about it. Bundle or sale, nothing else.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												When talking about Lume it’s impossible not to bring up its length, so I might as well start with that. Lume is very short, especially considering its price. It took me an hour to complete, and that’s including stopping to admire the visuals, and I honestly can’t see it taking much longer than that. You might draw it out to 90 minutes, but that’s about it.But if you look beyond that you’ll find an absolutely charming and adorable game. There, I said it. I’m supposed to be cynical goddamit, but here I am calling a game ‘adorable’. But it is, it absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing is. It’s made out of cardboard for god’s sake. CARDBOARD! Yes, this game didn’t take very long to win me over. Look at it though, it’s gorgeous. Sure, there isn’t much to see, but what you do see is incredible. I still can’t get over the fact the game’s made out of cardboard. Man, this game made me grin like a ♥♥♥♥ing child, and I hate it for it.It is a puzzle game, though the puzzles are rather generic and simple. Still, some fun brainteasers, but I feel resentful towards them because they aren’t made out of cardboard. In fact there isn’t much that is made of cardboard because the area is very small and can be explored in a few minutes, meaning you backtrack a lot and most of the length is spent solving puzzles.The fact that you don’t get much of the game’s best feature in a very short game is a bit of a problem, so it’s hard to recommend at full price. I got it in a bundle which was perfect, but for a considerable discount I’d say it’s worth experiencing. Then again, I’m all set for getting the sequel Lumino City (get it?), discounted or not, so maybe the price isn’t so bad after all...It’s made of cardboard though, and that’s got to count for something, right? Besides, this game will charm the pants off even the most cynical of people, even if it’s only for an hour.			",120,93,3,12,8,1,5

												I understand the negative reviews. 6 bucks IS a fair amount for such a short game, it's only about an hour and a half long, and its more of a setup for a  yet to be released sequal called Lumino City. Despite all of this, I reccomend getting this game on sale. The art style is unique, and the paper art style of the characters clashing with the realistic background is actually very appealing to the eye. It is one of the cutest games I've ever played. Even more unique are the puzzles. I would recommend not using a guide to this game, it makes completing the game that much more satisfying, Overall, If you can get this game on sale, or you are willing to spend $6 on ad hour and a half of gameplay, I would definatley pick it up			",179,70,1,21,9,0,7

												Although there's only Part 1 available to play right now, I enjoyed every minute of 1 hour++ taken to complete it.  Minimalistic/whimsical graphics, challenging puzzles and a colourful scheme were a good recipe for this game.  My only gripe so far - I wish there was an option to mute just the background audio music without muting the SFX too.  The BGM is pretty pleasant, until you get stuck on a puzzle for longer than you'd like and you just want some peace n quiet to think think think! (SFX is required to solve certain puzzles, so NO, the existing mute function does not help).  Other than that, it's a pretty enjoyable game, I hope the devs carry on with more parts soon! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While a great concept for animating a video game, I felt that this had idea had little exploration. There were some great puzzles that were appropriately cryptic and a good challenge to work out, but others became little more than an exercise in clicking a number of tiles until things looked right and hardly a challenge. These faults could be because the game is brief and we are given the plan to make an extented game, that could make the overall experience more fulfilling. Don't expect any big thrills here, but a slow-paced, short story.			",188,60,4,8,24,5,18

												The art style is nice, but the game itself isn't worth seven bucks at all.  Puzzles go from really easy to impossible without a guide, and there's only like seven puzzles in the entire game.  You could beat it in less than an hour, even if you got stuck.  Spend your seven bucks on something else, like one of the dungeon keeper games off of GOG.			",293,63,6,23,28,1,51

												Upshot: If you love artistic games, and are okay with limited amount of ""game"" content, go for it, it's gorgeous. If you want a significant chunk of story/plot, you will come away wanting more.  This is the first part of a series, and feels very much like an introduction or tutorial to a longger game.Absolutely beautiful, with some highly enjoyable and unique puzzles, this still left me disappointed. My two complaints:1. The game ended after what felt like an introduction. I am aware that this is the first part of a story that is to be continued, but I think too much effort was made to cram a full complement of puzzles into a small setting without enough actual story to go with them.2. The justification and structure of some of the puzzles seemed overly contrived. Why store innocuous and highly useful items in an undersink cabinet with an incredibly complex lock? That goes beyond the character justification of Grandpa loving puzzles.It's not inherently a flaw, but this game also has one of my personal least favorite puzzle structures- a seemingly-unrelated document that you must figure out the significance of and how to use its contents to solve an unspecified other puzzle. In this case, exacerbated by the stretch of my suspension of disbelief that the protagonist somehow picks this one document out of an entire bookshelf. Doesn't bother some people, bugs me badly.I really wanted to love this game, and I will probably get the next installment, despite the flaws, but given the sense of dissatisfaction I felt at the end, I am glad I got this as part of a bundle. I would be very displeased if I had paid full price. I would have been happier with a bit more room to move, and either a bit more story, or less hinting that there was going to be more; if I had known from the beginning that literally _all_ I was going to do was turn on the lights, I might have been okay with that.

												The graphical styling is beautiful and very unique. It's like a little teeny tiny work of art.Having said that, it's also so ridiculously short that it makes you feel like you've just about made it through the intro and then the game abruptly ends. I picked my copy up in a humble bundle and it was an added extra rather than the thing I bought the bundle for, but if I'd paid full price for this I think I'd be wondering how they justified the sticker price.If it was a demo for a (much) larger game then it would be a great recommendation, however as a paid for game in its own right it really isn't worth it.

												A sweet little casual adventure/puzzle game centered on energy and light. I like the quaint cardboard set as graphic style, although it could be even more gritty without problem, and the puzzles are plentiful and varied enough for one to move to another if you don't really get it the first time. Music's a little tedious after a while, but not actually annoying.A little quibble: It's a Flash game, and that's not in itself a disqualifier but the Flash Player doesn't hide the menubar properly on OS X. I can easily overlook this though.EDIT: completed way too easily!			",4,21,0,1,5,0,3

												Yes or No?  Yes, but with a caveat.I paid 1,49USD.  Was it worth that?  Sure.  I like puzzle games and point-and-click adventures, so it hit the spot for my appetite.  I played it with my wife, and it was worth playing.If I had purchased it for 5,99, would I have felt satisfied?  No.  The game has two big faults: brevity and obtuse puzzles.  We fully completed the game in about 1,5 hours.  The game takes place in one location, really, and with only one real task to accomplish.  So any length has more to do with puzzles that have solutions that are rather obscure.  Not only that, but actually several moments brought intense frustration as we found that the correct click boxes for specific objects can be only a few pixels in size, while the rest of the object brings no success.  So you click on one object to see what it does and find the task fruitless, only to click somewhere NEAR to where you originally clicked after exhausting all other options for 15 minutes and find that it now works.  That is infuriating, and better designed objects could have made this game a much shorter experience.I don't know what else to say.  If you're okay with a snack of a game for $1,49 (or your regional equivalent) then it's good enough for that.  But for $5,99 you should look elsewhere.			",44,42,0,6,6,0,8

												           You ( Lumi ) are stopping by your grandpa's house to see if hes around.however, with a partial shopping list reinstituted as a note spacifically for you tacked on the door, reveals that he is in town to see if he can be illuminated as to why there there seems to be a lack of power. it seems that he wants to energize his own house, but has hit a snag, and wishes you to help him regain power with what you're able to find around the house. this sets you off on your sadly short, but quite touching ""adventure"" around the property.This is a point and click adventure, where you'll explore lumi's grampa's house in order to solve puzzles and acquire items to gain the materials needed to help your grandad to become more.. self reliant. power wise anyway. this is a heart warming, fun, and cheap title. it may only keep your attetion for about an hour and 10 minutes, if that, but there is a hint at more content being added later, so why not give it a try?

												Lume is a short, simple and linear story with several puzzles to solve in order to get to the end. The game runs on flash. The graphics are children-book-alike and the animation is a nice effort on 2.5-D. Gameplay it smooth (simple point and click). The music is nice and calm but if you spend too much time playing the game, the loop can result a little bit boring. The puzzles are rather difficult for a game whose looks seem to be children-oriented and the game gives you almost no-clues. The lenght of the game is, to be honest, too short.The studio behind Lume (State of Play) is working on a longer and more complex sequel to this game, but unless you catch Lume on a bundle or at a great low price, I would recommend you to buy this first game on the series only if you really love to contribute to small indie teams or if you hate long games (Lume really, really feels too short).

												Too short, feels incomplete and puzzles are either too easy or way too counter-intuitive and unnecessary complex. But, yeah, the main thing is... this game is just a demo. Not a ""Part 1"" - maybe a half-decent prologue. Maybe LuminoCity is a more complete experience. I haven't played LuminoCity and don't intend to anytime soon. Who knows maybe LuminoCity is a ""part 2"" of an even ""larger ongoing story"" - brrrr. The art style is great and you can tell that it takes a lot of time and resources to prepare these in-game scenes. So it definitely is worth some of the positive press it got (though, some of the press I 've read might have been way too positive for what the game actually is). Perhaps Lume could be appended to (read: included with) LuminoCity because on its own it stands poorly.So, maybe it's worth picking up at a sale, provided that you are aware that you are buying a short-even-for-a-demo of a game.

It follows through with a simple and basic storyline where Lumi helps to power up the house and lights as she waits for her grandfather. The puzzles are not brutally difficult, though some do require some thought. Honestly not fantastic, but in my opinion, it serves as a stepping stone to its recently launched sequel -- Lumino City. Now that, is something which is remarkably beautiful and am looking forward to playing too!			",12,2,0,0,0,0,0

												Tl;dr: Short low res flash point and click adventure game which could do well with more guides to help you along. Good artistic quality and music.You play as Lumi who visits her grandfather's place only to find him missing and the house without power. You then go about clicking various items to find clues and puzzles to advance forward in the quest of restoring powering back to the house. There are about 7 puzzles, of varying difficulty, from matching patterns and numbers, a map with a grid, a puzzle board, to one with a musical sequence. I got stumped at the last puzzle and found it too vague, with minimal instructions and clues. Frustrated and without any further hints in game to move forward I resorted to an online guide. The last puzzle I thought could do with more clearer instructions and/or hints and likewise for the plot device of assembling a contraption which required some items that were not clearly stated. Puzzles and exploring things through clicking around were fine, but it got to a stage where it felt like a wild goose chase, except you are not quite sure what you are supposed to find in the first place.After the struggles and expecting to progress forward, the game came to an abrupt end with a promise of a continuation. That was about under an hour of gameplay. The second instalment called Lumino City was scheduled to be released Spring'13 but seems to be delayed, though there are updates on their facebook page as at Jan'14. The sequel seems to involve a larger world for exploration and more puzzles. Commendable is the artistic quality that was put into the building of the detailed sets and the pleasing music fitted the atmosphere well.The flash game ran at a small 800 x 535 resolution so it sat in a black rectangular box in the middle of the screen. Overall, the lack of hints or signposts to point you in the right direction along with the short duration and lack of replay value for the game, I find it hard to justify the value of the game, even for a quick one off experience.

												This game's charm and visual style is phenomenal... But the length (about half an hour for my trip through it) is extremely jarring. I guess I sort of expected more once I realized the game's most complicated puzzle involved me needing to brush up on my music reading skills (which took longer than the length of the game to read -- although this is still better than learning to count in D'ni...)

												Lume's not a bad game. There's really only one puzzle that I feel is poorly designed, which requires you to dig through the same handful of books a bunch until you happen upon a specific one with a very vague clue on it, look through the rest of the page, and then visit the Internet and look up the solution.Results may vary.I understand Lume as an art piece. And it's a pretty cool one, having used papercraft dioramas to create a point-and-click adventure game. It works better than you might expect. The game doesn't look bad, either, though the characters turned me away before I even started the game. I don't really like their look, but that's not really the problem with this game.The issue with Lume is that it's short. Including time spent checking the Internet, Steam tells me that it took 0.8 hours to beat the game. So that's roughly 48 minutes. Now, this game is $7. That's a lot of money for less than an hour of an art piece game. I could understand a dollar or two. I wouldn't be so cruel as to suggest it should be free, I know we all have to make money. But for the content, $7 is steep. It's for that reason alone that I cannot recommend it.The ending mentions that it is the end of Lume: Part 1. If Part 2 were released as an update to the original game, then the price would make a lot more sense. After all, episodic games have been known to charge for the entire game, and then release over sometimes very lengthy amounts of time. Though it's been nearly three years since Part 1's release, at the time of this writing. Another quick glance at the Internet tells me that the next part is still in development, but after all of this time and considering the flash format, I strongly doubt that such will be the case.

												I really wish I could recommend this game, but I cannot. The overall feeling was that of frustration, disappointment... and for a payed game this isn't right. I have hopes this company they can make it better on their next title.+ Visually, it is a beautiful and creative approach to game design, everything being hand-made. There is a feeling of authentic and of passion put into it.+ The music is soothing and well composed. - Some of the puzzles are hard just because they don't make sense. They rely on some kind of private logic which feels like a mixture of random tricks and it's frustrating. Basicly testing our ability to guess.- The game is very very short and leaves a sense of having achieved nothing. It's brief story didn't captivate me.- Usability issues: the dialog boxes auto-fade too fast, the mouse cursor is just the default pointer or hand, the resolution is low and to get full screen we must use the Flash-player's default menu to Zoom in.This game should be considered just a demo, and should be for free.

												Ok, so this is a puzzle game. When I started playing, the first thing I noticed was the very neat graphics. It was a great idea to use the cardboard looking graphics in this beautifly designed game, makes it all feel cousy.The puzzles are both few and pretty easy to beat, but they are definitely great for younger ages for their simplicity. As the game only took me less than an hour to beat there wasn't a lot of gameplay to it. And I think the reason for me to take that long was the overall relaxed atmosphere that this game brought.Part of the reason it had a relaxed atmosphere was the very slow and cousy soundtrack that I enjoyed listening to.I would've loved to say that I'm recommending this game to all puzzlelovers out there, but the lack of gameplay and puzzles makes this game just not worth your money.Pros:*Cute graphics*Good soundtrack*There was a red line in the storyCons:*Too few, easy puzzles*Short gameMy overall rating of the game is 6/10			",212,52,8,30,29,2,28

												A very very short point-and-click game which features a beautiful landscape made entirely by the hand. It follows through with a simple and basic storyline where Lumi helps to power up the house and lights as she waits for her grandfather. The puzzles are not brutally difficult, though some do require some thought. Honestly not fantastic, but in my opinion, it serves as a stepping stone to its recently launched sequel -- Lumino City. Now that, is something which is remarkably beautiful and am looking forward to playing too!			",12,2,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked this up a while ago and was perturbed by its short length. Granted, it was picked up on the cheap, but at this point, even at a discounted price of around $2, I can't find myself recommending it over other adventure/puzzle games on Steam. The visual style is fresh and unique and I like it, but that doesn't offset the short length (only about 30 minutes) and the lack of inspiration/challenge behind the puzzles. You can find longer and better games like this for the same price, and looking into the company, there doesn't appear to be a release date in mind for the sequel. After so many years, that is very disconcerting. Take your money and look elsewhere for a more complete game at a similar price, or put your money on a Humble Bundle.			",267,166,3,45,23,3,23

												Tl;dr: Short low res flash point and click adventure game which could do well with more guides to help you along. Good artistic quality and music.You play as Lumi who visits her grandfather's place only to find him missing and the house without power. You then go about clicking various items to find clues and puzzles to advance forward in the quest of restoring powering back to the house. There are about 7 puzzles, of varying difficulty, from matching patterns and numbers, a map with a grid, a puzzle board, to one with a musical sequence. I got stumped at the last puzzle and found it too vague, with minimal instructions and clues. Frustrated and without any further hints in game to move forward I resorted to an online guide. The last puzzle I thought could do with more clearer instructions and/or hints and likewise for the plot device of assembling a contraption which required some items that were not clearly stated. Puzzles and exploring things through clicking around were fine, but it got to a stage where it felt like a wild goose chase, except you are not quite sure what you are supposed to find in the first place.After the struggles and expecting to progress forward, the game came to an abrupt end with a promise of a continuation. That was about under an hour of gameplay. The second instalment called Lumino City was scheduled to be released Spring'13 but seems to be delayed, though there are updates on their facebook page as at Jan'14. The sequel seems to involve a larger world for exploration and more puzzles. Commendable is the artistic quality that was put into the building of the detailed sets and the pleasing music fitted the atmosphere well.The flash game ran at a small 800 x 535 resolution so it sat in a black rectangular box in the middle of the screen. Overall, the lack of hints or signposts to point you in the right direction along with the short duration and lack of replay value for the game, I find it hard to justify the value of the game, even for a quick one off experience.

I appreciate that it must have been a ton of work to make, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game unless at least some of the promised future chapters are free for those who buy the first chapter.

												The art style is lovely and about 10 mins of the game is figuring out what you can click on and then figuring out what you need to do with this information. This is not a bad thing, since most point and click games are like this, but there aren't many puzzles and it's not always clear what you're meant to be doing. The game takes about half an hour to finish and feels incomplete (even though there is a clear ending to the game) because it's short.It's not a bad game, it's unique in it's style and I like the power theme and the animations are alright, but I would only recommend buying it when it's on sale (under the $4 USD mark).

Sometimes the solutions are pretty strange (i.e. why do I have to apply an inventory item _twice_ to an object?). Overall this feels more like a proof of concept than a polished game. The graphical style is nice, but it's really low-res for today's standard. Overall I wouldn't really recommend getting it.			",11,3,0,1,1,0,2

												In the ever-expanding gold mine of cheap yet insanely fun games on Steam, Lume is a dud. Beatenin less than an hour, the puzzles are simple and easy (with the exception of one very obscure solution). If I remember correctly, I got this game in a bundle with several others for around $6, which is actually the full price of this game now. I would advise to wait for a similar bundle or steam sale if this game really interests you.			",335,120,3,46,32,5,62

												I kind of wish there was a ""maybe"" button for a recommendation.  And here's why:Pros:1. The game is absolutely adorable. Everything is hand-made out of cardboard, and the details are just awesome. I personally love indie games like this; so I really enjoyed it. 2. The puzzles can be difficult, and you really need to explore the entire area to find clues. Some will come easily to you, and others will force you to think.3. Its only chapter one of the series. Although this game came out a while ago, if you go on luminocitygames.com, you can read the blog about the game. And pretty soon there is going to be another game out.Cons:1. Short game. Not entirely sure if its worth $5.99 for this short of an indie game. Yes it is super cute and the puzzles are fun. But realistically, once you finish the game, you can whiz past the puzzles again. I got it on sale when it was $1.99. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lume feels more like a Demo than a full game. When you first play the game your first impression will be of the lovely visual style but then you will wonder why you cannot play this in actual full screen (The game is presented in a small box with no options to enlarge it what-so-ever). So the game looks lovely and you start to explore, you see a city in the background and I truly thought that was meant to be level 2 or that I would get over there and have more puzzles to complete... NOPE. You complete barely a few puzzles and the game ends. The puzzles are not very hard, I think one or two were just annoying but thats it. I think there was 7 puzzles in total and that is the whole game, don't expect anything extra.So finally do I reccomend the game? YES....... If it was free or a demo but to actually PAY for this is absurd. The game had potential, I would forgive the easy puzzles if it was just level 1 but no, it was the full game.Luckily I got this title as part of a bundle so I sorta paid for it but sorta didn't.

												The game is way too short, and rather unfulfiling in what little playtime it offers. The visual style is cute and adorable, which was what I went for when I bought this. There's a mobile version of Lume for smartphones too, and in my opinion it's probably worth $0.99 or $1.99. Sure, price isn't comparable between mobile and PC platforms, but honestly though, only get this game when/if it's on sale.			",77,30,0,9,6,0,4

												The music and visuals are great, that I have to say, but they will not save Lume from being boring, short and a part of a multi-episode game. I paid for this in a Humble Bundle sale, so no big loss for me. But don't get this game, it's not worth the time, money and bandwidth on downloading this hunk of junk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't even know what to say about this game, I didn't make it very far in.The way it starts off, the story seems to have been an after-thought, and point-n-click games are mainly meant to be story driven games.This game also appears to have simply been done in flash, and as such, you can not right click as you can in most point-n-click games.Overall, I would not recommend this game.

												Lume is a cute but challenging short adventure/puzzle game. Emphasis on the short! Start to finish this will take an hour, depending on how difficult you find the puzzles. Definitely feels like the first chapter of a longer game. Lume's visuals are incredible, and I'm looking forward to Lumino City, which I assume will be full-game length... Recommended for adventure game fans, but the $6 asking price is a bit much for the length. Look for a sale or a bundle purchase.			",145,68,0,18,10,1,19

												Don't buy this game. You'll waste your time looking for the right pixels to click and it's very short (if you don't get stuck). Some puzzles are way too easy, while others are simply inconsistent, illogical and thus very fustrating. Worst puzzle-game i've ever played!			",146,61,1,5,23,3,11

												This is a great game so far- the beautiful environment and music really makes it a unique and breathtaking experience. My main complaint however, is that this flash game is in such a small window. It is almost like a mobile game, since the maxiumum window size is so small. It would be much better if it was in HD and I could full-screen it. Also, the clicking doesn't feel too natural. The way that you explore the environment around you could be improved.

												I played a little bit of Lumino City before i discovered there was a game before that. I love Lumino City so i went and bought Lume. SO disappointing! The puzzles makes no sense at all. I had to look at a walk-through while playing. If the puzzles had been logical ""as they are in Lumino City, it would have taken 10 minutes to finish which is not worth anyone's money. I do like the art and the characters. It's very cute and very well made.			",0,3,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not get this game, It is basicly a paid demo. I played it for an hour and a half on a stream and i spent most of it geting angry and trying to find the ""hints"" they give you (which were stupidly difficult to find) The puzzles were extremly difficult to figure out even though im normaly good at puzzles. It is not worth the 6 bucks you normaly pay for nor is it the 3 bucks i pays for on a sale. As pretty as it is it doesnt make up for how short it is and how difficult it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lume is a little game, packed with several puzzles that you must solve. It took some time to get them all solved and some of them are quite tricky (especially the second locker). What I found the most interesting is the design: Lume is an indie game to behold, made for those who cares about aesthetics more than anything else. After installing and entering the game, my first reaction was ""you must be kidding me"", because everything is filmed, all the scenario is handmade and the soundtrack is immersive...It's a short game and, definitely, a beautiful revival of the adventure/point-and-click genre. I spent just ¥299, after looking for some indie games with the same vibe of those made by Amanita Design (Machinarium, Botanicula, Samorost 2). If you like Indie Games, Puzzle, Adventure/Point-and-click and, most of all, you enjoy the art and music, Lume is a nice one. Already getting ready for Lumino City.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You will probably like this game, or not. It's really debatable if it's a game to buy or not. I thought the idea of putting flash animations on a model was really neat and deserves praise. The big problem was that it's short. It's REALLY short. I get the point of doing episodes, but it was unclear if there was going to be a sequel until I looked at the depeloper's page on the Steam store (and yes, there will be).Otherwise, some puzzles were easy, and some others were harder than necessary. But it was fun none the less.All in all, buy this game only if it's on sale or if you're willing to buy the upcoming episodes.			",195,38,2,11,9,0,14

												Lume has a very nice graphics, but still, $6,99 for a game which has 6-7 puzzles and you can complete all of them in  30 minutes is definitely not worth! If you want to play, wait until it on sale.By the way, this game is the first part of series, which mean the story in this game isn't completed and you'll have to wait for the sequels.
