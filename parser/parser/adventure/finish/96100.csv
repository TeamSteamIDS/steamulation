												Defy Gravity is a platformer with a simple concept:  Get from point A to point B by creating attraction/repulsion areas.  The game is simple but fun, and provides a good challenge during the second half of the game.  It can be tricky but the checkpoints are placed in such a way that you're willing to take risks and try new ideas to get past some obstacle - a very important attribute for puzzle games.The only thing that is sub par is the animation (or lack of).  It isn't really needed, but the game has the GameMaker feel, a bunch of sprites just moving around the screen with a short walking animation, which I find kind of off putting.  It isn't important, but it should be mentioned.If you like physics manipulation games or platformers, then I recommend buying this.  The game is $3 at the time of this writing, more than worth it.

												It's hard not to recommend this, given that I made a 7 cent profit from buying the game then selling the cards... getting paid to play a game is never wrong. :-)But even ignoring that, I had a surprisingly good time with it. Defy Gravity is your basic puzzle platformer where you have to use an unusual mechanic to navigate levels. In this case, you can shoot gravity fields that attract you or repel you and activate a shield that lets you ignore all gravity fields. By mixing these, you can sort of rocket-jump-grapple-hook your way through levels. Some timed jumping and obstacles that sometimes are and sometimes are not affected by the gravity are there to stop your progress.In the words of a wise man, you're going to die. A lot. The game takes delight in throwing stuff in your way at just the wrong moment. But at the same time, it's surprisingly forgiving with how you swing around the level and you can often brute force your way through tight spots. ""Hectic"" is not a word you usually associate with puzzlers, but Defy Gravity can get pretty hectic -- and that's when it's arguably at its most fun. For me it hits just the right balance between frustration and challenge.The graphics and sound are absolutely nothing special, but in terms of pure gameplay, this is value for money even when it's not 90% off. When it is, of course, it's a no-brainer, just get it. :-) ",136,36,1,17,7,2,27

												I just bought it for cards admittedly (at $0.29), but I actually found it rather fun to play instead of just idling. The game is short so I have to say only buy it on a major sale, but well worth the time if these kind of games interest you.Gameplay wise it is a fun platformer, and does remind me a bit of Portal. It isn't an exact copy though, instead of Portals, you manipulate Gravity to repel and attract yourself and other objects. The momentum and physics of the game is fun to toy with, though it CAN be frustrating at times. Checkpoints are placed in fair spots of most stages to reduce frustration, but later stages stretch this out quite a bit so you will have to keep on your toes or be prepared to die again and again.I did beat the main story but I decided to leave before continuing deep into hard mode. It takes away one of your powers and while I do feel that's an interesting challenge, I'm satisfied with just beating the main modes.			",339,69,13,39,21,4,31

OverviewDefy Gravity Extended is a small game, with only a few tricks, but does it very well. It lacks the flair of a quality game, but once you go in and try it, it certainly redeems itself. In this game, you play as a spacesuit wearing gravitymancer trying to pass the gauntlet. You are equipped with a gravity gun (not the HL type!) and have to traverse many levels to prove your worth!The Pros:Simple Concept - If you can make a simple game fun, you have succeeded as a developer. The game mechanics are very simple. You move about, and create two types of ""portals"". One that has a strong gravitational pull and one that repels objects. You can also activate a shield around you that negates any gravity effects. Leaving breaking the laws of physics aside, you must combine these simple actions in order to get yourself to the exit.Good Level Design - I'm not talking about the aesthetics, of course! I'm referring to the level layout, the challenges you face, their diversity, their difficulty. It impressed me how challenging this game became in later levels, without repeating itself throughout. The levels are many times relying on sinusoidal patterns and geometric arrays of projectiles!Challenging - The levels begin increasingly harder, and some are outright stressful. If you are looking for something to test your skill and patience with, you've come to the right place!Good Music - The background music is a nice relaxing tune that suits the space environment we are supposed to be in. Really helps ease out the stress from those hard levels.Cheap - The game is 0.99€ at normal price and can go all the way down to 0.09€ when on sale. So, just give it a try, it will cost you basically nothing. (Not to mention it has Steam Trading Cards)Achivements! - Few achievements, only requirement is passing the game. Sounds easy, huh? It's not, but good luck, hunters!The Cons:Ugly Visuals - The textures aren't eye candy and everything is flat and pixelated. While I'm not saying a game is good if it looks good, it wouldn't hurt getting a little face lift every now and then.Shabby Animations - The animations are barely existent, sometimes movement may seem plastic, especially the way your character tilts its body when looking at the cursor.Conclusion:Defy Gravity Extended is certainly not a game for everyone, so if you don't like skill-based platformers with minimal controls, then look elsewhere. If however, you like that sort of thing and still have the pocket change from grocery shopping, then consider giving it a go!If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												This is a good puzzle + action game, which also requires your micro operations. You will find the game becomes more and more challenging with your gravity gun and anti-gravty gun. However, a great difficulty awaits you because you have only the first gun in the hard mode. In a word, this game is very worth playing.一个很有挑战的动作类解密游戏。解密元素在于你在游戏种可以操作重力枪和反重力枪，还有可以不使你受到（反）重力场影响的外套。你会发现游戏越来越难，要求你能灵活使用两类枪。但其实，后面还有困难模式等待你：让你只能用重力（引力）枪。			",390,185,9,30,36,3,64

												Defy Gravity (henceforth known as DG) is an example of what a small indie game should be.Gameplay:Based on two types of gravity spheres, one pushing you away and one pulling you towards it. Using these you have to traverse levels and bounce/throw yourself across pits. Overall the gameplay is simple, standard WASD and mouse, plus having support for a controller. Graphics&Sound:What are you expecting out of an indie game? The sound is above average, as the music is pretty nice. The graphics are typical, though not bad enough to be annoying. The one complaint i do have with this game is that your character looks as if he's using a Super Soaker rather than a gravity gun. The Good: I got this when it was on sale for $.14 (yes, 14/100) and it was a nice, cheap pickup. It'll provide a good amount of fun.The Bad: The controls are a bit wonky and some of the levels require split-second reactions.Overall Grade: C+ Not Bad, but it's a small game, good to play if you got a few minutes to kill.

Fun gameplay for about 15 minutes2.) Alright music for a cheap indie game3.) Controller support (If you like that)4.) Really inexpensive alternative to the Portal franchiseCons:1.) Graphics could have been run through MSDos2.) Locked resolution3.) It's that kind of game you will play for fifteen minutes, beat it, and never touch again4.)

I haven't finished the game, as i'm stuck in stage 5, but with enough effort you can finish it and feel the joy of completing such a difficult task.I'd say this game is well worth the full price for its gameplay, soundtrack and challenge, but you may as well wait for a promotion, as the price goes down an insane amount (around 90%).

												Defy Gravity Extended it's an indie game based in physics / gravity laws. It could looks like a horrible game. I mean art and animations are simple and it can feels empty, otherwise it's too challenging. You can feel that it's a 2D version of ""Portal"", you have a gun that has two functions, repel and attract.Something that i loved in this game was the relaxing background music that makes you relax during stressful levels.It has enough good levels and after finish it the nightmare haven't finished yet, you have to complete it twice in order to get all achievements, something that will make you rage.It's always on discount (95% off i guess), so if your style it's the challenges you can give it a chance.7.5 / 10If you found this review helpful you can find out more at our Completing the Backlog's Curator page.

												Decent puzzle and platformer game that involves placing gravity and anti-gravity wells strategically across hazards and obstacles Kara must travel across to reach the exit in every stage. There are approximately 21 levels altogether, plus the same 21 levels for the real Gauntlet mode where Kara may only place gravity wells. Although some levels can be frustrating due to the random and unpredictable movement patterns of some of the hazards, the game is forgiving and has checkpoint locations to enable instant retries at each checkpoint location along various intervals in each level.

												This game was a lot of fun and very reminiscent of the early 2000s online flash games, which gave me a wonderful nostalgic feeling all throughout the game. This puzzle-platformer is straightforward, however reaching your end goal can and will be difficult. The simplicity and correct execution of this game's design creates that unique feeling, where the player knows finishing this level is solely due to the player’s ability to perform. No game exploits, no grinding to get to a certain level or luck driven events. Just simple, skill-based levels with original and adaptive gameplay.Granted that not everyone is into 2D flash puzzle-platformers, this game may not be what everyone is looking for, however if you do purchase this game and give it the time of day, I think you might be pleasantly surprised at how much fun you'll have.Extra - The authentic soundtrack is very atmospheric and enjoyable.

												Tough platforming game, but worth the cheap price you can find it at, or especially when it goes on sale you can easily find it for less than a buck.  The goal, to reach the end of each level offering a different level of difficulty with different obstacles.  The gimmick, a double jump ability and an anti-gravity/well-gravity gun.  Using both of these while stagnant is easy though tricky, but when you have to use them while on the run can prove quite difficult and at times frustrating.  The hard mode features only the well-gravity gun.  Beating this latter mentioned segment proved really difficult and a true test of the puzzle and platforming skills.  I did find a few odd issues.  At times the screen would go black when loading or reloading a level.  Shooting would fix the problem, however, if the level was saved at a save point, you may need to act quickly, shooting and eliminating your gravity shot then moving forward when given limited time only added to the difficulty and when it's unnecessary difficulty, it made it really bad.  The graphics are simple, the sound and music forgettable, but it's the gameplay that wins this game a recommendation.Overall though, I did appreciate the tests and found the game worthy of playing and I do recommend it for you if you can deal with proper frustration and sometimes improper and unnecessary frustrations.

												Defy Gravity Extended is a puzzle platformer game where you play as Kara, a gravitymancer. You will use a gun that places gravity wells and anti-gravity wells. You will use them often to solve various puzzles throughout the game. Gravity well pulls you into its center, while anti-gravity wells repels you from its center.Defy Gravity Extended has a very unique game mechanic, it is quite different than most puzzle platformer games I've played. The soundtrack for this game is very nice and relaxing too. You can get 100% achievements just by finishing the game. I like that the game doesn't make you finish a level in a particular time so you won't be pressured while playing. The game has 24 levels and certainly doesn't lack in challenge. There is also a checkpoint system in the game, so if you die, you won't start from the beginning which is nice.However, for me, it is more frustrating than It is to enjoy while playing this game. The controls are a little bit difficult. I don't like the animation. The game looks very unappealing to me. The game lacks on the options menu. You can't adjust the game's volume at all, so you will need to change it from Windows or your speaker. It also lacks in resolution options too. The game at one point crashes, but it wasn't in a middle of a level. The story is pretty much non-existent.In conclusion, Defy Gravity Extended is a unique and very challenging game. But it is very frustrating to play. I don't enjoy this game very much, maybe because this game isn't for me. The price seems a little fair though. But I do not recommend buying this full price since it goes on sale quite often. I do recommend purchasing this game on sale because it's usually on sale for 90% off or more.			",81,14,0,16,24,0,16

												Raw physics mechanics worth checking out. Sure it would be nicer if it was less rigid, but there is a charm to what is there. Level dificulty fluctuates and it could do with some better art direction.			",594,222,45,89,83,1,128

												Don't let the basic graphics fool you, this is a great little game. The game's gravity mechanics are a joy to play with, the difficulty level is just the right amount of frustrating and the music is lovely. Not too long either.			",583,324,16,51,57,4,79

												This game was absolutely fantastic. It has an original concept, and good application. It was challenging, fun, infuriating at times, and immensely satisifying to complete. The storyline is relatively simple - as are the controls. You will almost always be able to understand how a level should be beat, but the application will still be somewhat challenging, and may require a few attempts. Once you've beaten the game, there is a secondary playthrough which removes one of your abilities, rendering the game a completely different approach - needing more planning and less random leaping about. It assumes you know how the mechanics work at that point, then puts your knowledge to the test. The game was a bit short, but well paced. I would happily buy the game again, and at it's current price, it is more than worthwhile, even just to test it out.			",98,9,0,16,2,2,4

												""Release Date: 18 Mar, 2016"" Fake release date. This game has been out for at least a year, maybe 2 even. The release date has changed simply so that the game will appear on the Steam store front. Very fishy action from this dev and this should not be alowed on Steam. The new release date is simply fake and false. I played it for 5 minutes and crashed 5 times by pressing W at the start point. Seems to be made with Unity (or Clickteam), but badly coded. I also looked al the reviews and most of them now show up a 'pre release' due to the fake release date. Not to mention that a lot of the reviews seems to be super positive with a 10 minute total play time, so I call those fake too. I can't really check how good/bad the game is ,because I crash every minute just by pressing a key. This game does not seem to be something to be super positive about.Edit: apparently the game was released on steam in 2011.			",148,11,15,23,22,2,29

♥♥♥♥ Gravity - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Man has long yearned to fly among the stars. To be in space. The final frontier. There's all kinds of cool things up there, all of which could kill everyone on our planet in the blink of an eye. We could all just be a little flickering candle of a planet, snuffed out by the flap of a little space butterfly's wing. It's pretty cool.We've obviously never really been in space though, or on the moon. That's a conspiracy perpetuated by Richard Nixon and the Disney Channel. You don't want to believe the lies, but it makes people happy. Just like the tooth fairy or the concept of chivalry. You can believe whatever you like, but really all they want is to get in your mouth and leave some money on your nightstand.While humanity will probably never REALLY be in space, because space is actually also a conspiracy that Disney Channel likes to keep going for their ""special interests"", we can imagine what this fictitious place called outer space is like through video games. Yeah!According to the legends, people can float in space. There's a force that pulls things towards planets, but there's none of it in space. ""Gravity"", they call it. It's apparently what holds us onto Earth. Even though everyone knows that we're actually held to the Earth's surface by the natural paste on our feet and shoes. If you ever sprayed non-stick cooking spray on your feet, you'd float into the sun and die.But gravity makes for an interesting theoretical concept, and an even better game. Defy Gravity, which has also apparently been Extended, is a sweet little gem of a PC game you can get on Steam.Defy Gravity is a little budget puzzle platformer. Nothing too fancy. I probably bought it for a quarter. But definitely a quarter well-spent. It's short, sweet, fun, and surprisingly smart.There's a definite Portal vibe going on here, and it's at least mildly Metroid-inspired in some way. Your character controls gravity with their gun, which is capable of shooting two different colors to make pushy gravity and pully gravity. They also PLOT TWIST ARE GIRL WITH BOOBIES. GIRLS CAN PLAY GAMES TOO.WHEN HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF AND HAS THE BOOBS SO YOU KNOW IT'S FEMINISM.DID YOU KNOW GIRLS CAN DO THINGS.Defy Gravity packs a lot of punch for a simple game. I can count the amount of stage hazards on my fingers. And yet the way they're combined is never dull. It's a short, compact game. There's not a super bountiful amount of content. But for what you're paying for, they squeeze every little drop of game out of it.Most puzzle games need to be this huge♥♥♥♥♥Rube Goldberg type of thing. There's so many things everywhere, and you need to remember all these different elements that interact with one another in all these ways. And when all of that combines, you can pop a balloon or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Defy Gravity has like, a brick and some lemons. One lemon has a nail wedged into it. There's a dog. And yet they manage to pop the ♥♥♥♥ out of so many balloons. There's some really memorable levels with only those elements. It's humble, and it's simple. But it's smart, it's fun, and it's well-worth the quarter I spent on it.It's a budget title for sure. Everything seems to follow the basic theme of ""Not amazing, but for a quarter this is pretty nice"". It's not meant to be the biggest, most impressive game you can buy. Graphically, it's incredibly simplistic. It almost looks like it was done in Flash or something. The sprites are decent, but everything is very basic looking. The graphics work though. They're unimpressive, but they're not ugly. It has a nice look to it, the sprites are well made, and the general art direction and style works.Its game design and mechanics are its biggest selling point. It's not even particularly long. It's pretty short actually. But it's a brutal platformer later in the game, so it can definitely take you a few hours to complete with the excellently done difficulty ramp considered. And if you're a sucker for brutal puzzle-platforming, the extra Hard mode post-game is enough to frustrate most platformer fans.There was clearly some love put into the game. It's well-designed and has a nice coat of polish. Cheap polish, yeah. Not the name brand polish that all the super models use. More like store brand Kmart polish. It'll get the job done. Might even look nice. They'll never know, probably. Your mother-in-law will be able to tell, and she'll gossip about it to everyone just to spite you. You ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. But no one else will notice otherwise.It's a nice game. It's pretty nice. Better than most things you'd buy on Steam for the price. It's like the difference between putting your quarter in a fancy machine with flashy lights and junk, and giving your quarter to a homeless heroin addict. You want to pay for the nice machine, not only to reward yourself with the gumball but to reward the nice people that took the time to build this nice machine. You don't want to flip a quarter to a guy that's gonna save up to shoot himself up with heroin, break into your house and♥♥♥♥♥♥your guinea pig or your sister or something. Think of the guinea pigs.

PresentationDefy Gravity follows a similar road with some other platformers we've seen lately, using space as a foundation for the game, as you take control of one of the Gravitymancers who came to the Gauntlet, the ultimate test, in order to prove themselves. However, where other platformers with a similar pattern such as The Swapper manage to tell an interesting and unique story using the darkness and emptiness of space, Defy Gravity only introduces you to the Gauntlet, without actually telling you what it really is, what purpose does it serve and why would anyone risk their lives just to prove that they can get to the end. It is quite obvious that story isn't the main focus here, but even so it's hard not to notice the missed opportunity, since The Gauntlet itself could've been filled with messages from others who tried and were defeated by The Gauntlet or pretty much anything at all to justify your desire to finish it; instead you're left with a left to right Mario-style platformer without any princess at the end.Rating: 4GameplayThe gameplay is based around the use of gravity wells, which can be created using your gun, in addition to the ones that are already placed on the map and cannot be moved; using those wells properly and learning how they influence other objects is key in Defy Gravity, as almost every puzzle is based on how well you manage to use the gravity wells depending on position, as well as timing. There are two types of gravity wells: positive and negative; the positive wells will attract objects towards them, including yourself, while the negative ones will repel them, and combining those wells with your anti-gravity shield that makes you immune to all wells is what makes the gameplay unique and interesting. The whole concept does wear out by the end of the game, as there won't be any new ideas introduced into the game later on, leaving you mostly with more bouncing objects to avoid in order to make the game harder, something that does happen once you finish the game and Hard mode is unlocked, disabling negative gravity wells and changing a few things in each level in order to make it more challenging.Rating: 8.5GraphicsThe first thing you will probably notice are the backgrounds, which look amazing and change from level to level, but what on the other hand, the levels themselves are designed using the same monotone, gray blocks and the only thing that differentiates them one from another is the layout of those gray blocks and the bouncing objects between them. The visual effects are basic and nothing stands out, mostly because no beam or ray of light can move your eyes away from the galaxies in the background.Rating: 5AudioThe tunes are okay, but since there is no story or momentum to what is happening, this is probably one of those titles you'll play with your own music in the background. The sound effects feel absent most times, as they are either too quiet or not in total sync with the action, but then again you probably won't need those anyway.Rating: 4.5ExtrasFor its 3€ price tag, Defy Gravity offers enough to justify the purchase, even if you can finish the game in less than two hours, adding 2-3 more hours to that time if you're down for the Hard mode, but if you are looking for anything extra, there is nothing more to the game than the adventure itself.Rating: 7VerdictDefy Gravity is an okay platformer if you only care about the gameplay, as it does introduce a new concept even if it only lasts for a short time, but for anything else you might expect from this game, you will probably be disappointed.Rating Overall: 5.8Check out the full review and a lot more about Defy Gravity at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=366 ",142,34,2,13,6,2,7

Defy Gravity Extended is a very nice and short game that will satisfy anyone who has had enough of mindless shootings. The biggest asset is obviously the freedom to choose while solving puzzles and a feeling that the laws of physics are at our mercy. The graphics and music are perfectly matched. Everything is in its place and a pleasure for both the eye and the ear. So take a gun in hand and ... go right? Yes. It's just a simple, small, modest low-budget minigame.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

Gameplay'Defy Gravity' is a platformer that uses physics (gravity). It has the usual jump-or-die and dodge-or-die mechanics, but you can also create two kinds of wells: a gravity well that pulls you and certain objects towards it an anti-gravity well that repels you and certain objects away from itAdd to that the option to switch on a body shield, which renders you immune to all gravity and anti-gravity effects, and you have some nice mechanics to play with.DifficultyI'm not a big fan of the platformer genre because I find standard platformers too 'twitchy' for my taste. But occasionally, I wil try a platformer game that has some special mechanics like the wells in 'Defy Gravity'. So you need to read the rest of this section knowing that I'm only a very casual platformer gamer.I have to admit I liked 'Defy Gravity' and I had a lot of fun until the 'Grandmaster levels'. Judging from the Steam Achievements, that's almost halfway through the game. At that point, you get a warning screen letting you know that the game is kicking it up a notch and is about to get - and I quote: ""much more difficult"".I noticed in the first 'Grandmaster level' that the game was no longer my cup of tea because it got way too difficult and yes, too twitchy for me. But I suppose for hardcore platformer gamers, the fun would only just begin at that point. I would like to point out that all the footage seen in the demo video here on Steam is from pre-Grandmaster levels. I'm not saying that's a conspiracy on the makers' part or something like that, it's just so you know when looking at that footage and thinking to yourself 'that doesn't look too hard to me'.Graphics and soundThe graphics are ok. They are nothing special but certainly good enough for a game of its genre. I invite you to take a look at the video and the screen shots to judge for yourself.A lot of reviewers don't like the music. I can relate to that but personally, it didn't bother me and I have a low tolerance for annoying music and sounds. For the most part, I even thought the music was nice and at least fitting for the game. So it's clearly a matter of personal taste and let's leave it at that.There are no options whatsoever for graphics or sound. A word about the Steam extras'Defy Gravity' has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 just for running the game.The Steam Achievements are uninspired. They are limited to your classic 'pass x number of levels and get an achievement'. If you just play through the 'easy' part of the game, you'll end up with 4/8 so a 50% completion rate.			",232,141,2,44,9,3,34

												Nailing that feeling of satisfaction when you’ve figured out a solution to the task at hand is very difficult. Not all mechanics allow it and not all games offer more than one route from point A to point B. I believe gravity manipulation and physics-based gameplay is one of the greatest things gaming has bothered exploring. When done well, it is logical, intuitive and rewarding. It’s like pulling out that second to last piece of Jenga.This is what Defy Gravity Extended is: an extremely satisfying game. You play as Kara, following the Samus school of power armour where you couldn’t tell the gender were it not for the game description. She has to prove herself as a Gravitymancer in the Gauntlet, using her sassy gravity gun (which looks a bit like a Super Soaker). The gun can set two kinds of fields: one that attracts and one that repels. This is the basic premise, and the levels are variations upon previously-set rules. You might encounter enemies who are also affected by the gravity fields, a level may turn your anti-gravity shield permanently on, or you’ll have to use platforms affected by your gravity gun as well.The graphics are really basic, and I admit I was a tad skeptical when I saw some screenshots, but after 5 minutes into the game all my doubts were washed away. The levels are very well-made and reward smart thinking. The first few stages give you hints where to place the respective gravity fields, but you will soon realize that you can use even less resources than recommended.The music is also really good. Now, I’m not a music reviewer and I lack the capacity to translate how music feels using words, but Defy Gravity’s soundtrack took me off-guard in a very pleasant way.The only complaint I can think of is a lack of level editor, which seems extremely appropriate for a game like this.

												Hey! I know most of you already have this game, because it gets so damn cheap, considering the card prices, it even had effectively negative prices in the past.So, this review is not to make you buy this overlooked gem. It is to make you play it.First, who is the targeted audience here? If you liked, Rochard or Outland or any other puzzle platformer, you will feel like at home here. I know most of the reviewers really like using shortcut of, ""Yes, this is puzzle, and the most commonly loved puzzle game around is Portal, so I will just call this Portal in 2d AND space AND gravity guns rather than portal guns AND without an actual story AND heavily amateurish -or indie- AND with some minor bugs making controls a bit harder AND....As you can see if you say this game is similar to some other with some exceptions, but if number of these exceptions are more than 5, actually your so called similarity does not convey any information at all. So, I will just skip calling this ""2D PORTAL game"" even though I agree that it sounds catchy. It is not similar to that game. And btw, if the idea of 2d Portal sounds enticing to you, here is the original Portal game that started it all: http://armorgames.com/play/107/portal-the-flash-versionThis game is a puzzle game. You use a gravity gun whose stationary bullets move you towards it, and another one whose bullets repel you. You also have a shield, causing you not to be affected by those effects. You can just use once for each type, until your feet touches the ground. You use these mechanics, together with momentum to overcome some obstacles, reach some high places which is not obvious how to reach. Levels get progressively harder, introduces some enemies, some hazards, and new tools like free to move platforms, vanishing platforms etc to increase the complexity a bit.I really liked playing through it. The most used ""tactics"" is same for many puzzles, put an attractor, jump to it, put a repeller behind, cancel attractor then you are flying ahead.  Of course there are some others, and even using when to use that changes from puzzle to puzzle, and in the later levels, choosing where to put starting attractor also becomes a part of the question. But still, if this game was longer, it would be prone to become a chore. In current case, it introduces the mechanics, uses them all, tests whether you are really able to use all, and says farewell before giving you a chance to get bored.I have one minor and one more minor negative. First, minor one. Even though I can feel the effort put for attracting and repelling mechanisms, they dont work in a predetermined way. Sometimes you perfectly know what to do, still a milimetrical wrong placement of the ""bullet"" destroys your strategy. Not being able to assign moves from before hand, together with general difficulty of placement of ""bullet""s midfly, helps the feeling of glitchiness. I think there is no glitch here, only some calculations is not smoothed out. Really really really minor mistakes, even the ones that is not visible to the eye can cause to death.More minor one: In the last level, checkpoint placement sucks. I had to read through all of the Credits 50 times before finishing it. For the first 5 times, I thought ""Wow! Such a nice idea to implement credits here!"" Nearing the end, my thought was like this: ""These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are stealing my precious seconds again.""If you can oversee some minor problems with games like these, you will enjoy the effort and thought put here. There is also an extra ""New Game+""like mode, supposedly taking the option of attractors out, but I did not try it, so I cant comment on it. From what I have played though, I know that you will enjoy ""Aha!"" moments, and succeeding ""Finally nailed it"" moments. Not expect a perfect platformer or a hardest puzzle ever though. It is mediocre at both of these.TLDR:=========================if indie_tolerance==0{ignore;end}if indie_tolerance>0 and puzzle_love>0 and platformer_love>0{if cheapskate>0{get;end}else{maybe;end}}			",930,220,17,111,80,9,185

												An interesting platformer that although it may feel a bit cheap, i enjoyed it. Here you have a gun that can create a gravity or anti-gravity field, and you must use that to go through the levels. One thing i liked is that the gun isn't always necessary to progress, making the level design feel more balanced. There's 24 levels, and after that you unlock the hard mode, but either way the game isn't too hard, just challenging a few times. The graphics and music weren't impressive, but they got the job done. One thing i didn't like was the lack of a level select screen: you can only start a new game or continue. But it's a decent game nonetheless, and for cheap is worth of your time.

												The ability to alter gravity in a platformer is nothing new, but using gravity wells to do so is a novel concept that I haven't really seen done- at least, not with player controlled wells. At 24 levels, Defy Gravity is pretty short, but...Despite only having 24 levels, this is one of the most frustrating games I've played in a while. To put it bluntly: the main mechanics don't work right. Sometimes the wells pull you in/push you away as they're supposed to, sometimes nothing happens. Often with the blue wells I found myself looping around the center and dying, simply because the game felt like it. The design of most of the levels, especially near the end demand near perfect control with this utterly broken mechanic.Oh, and your air jump replenishes weirdly, sometimes triggers on the ground (hello, death!), and cuts all horizontal momentum when you jump.Hard mode strips you of the anti-wells and the only way to get any reliability from the mechanics is to use both in conjunction.Literally the only upside to this game is you can buy it, turn around and sell the cards for more money than the game itself. I guess that it's short helps too, but really this is not worth the effort to play through.			",69,23,2,14,4,0,13

												This game requires good forward thinking, great hand-to-eye coordination and an unearthly amount of patience to beat, especially if you want to get all the achievements.The use of gravity wells to adjust your jumps is the gimmick in this game, it is implemented to the core style of play and you’ll find yourself using it pretty much for all kinds of situations. Thankfully, the mechanics are very easy to learn, though it will take more than a few tries for the trial and errors to take hold in experience.There are 24 levels in total, you can expect to die countless times on laser traps, football-like projectiles, collapsible platforms, shuriken shooting bots, moving walls of doom and the classic never-ending pits of doom. It won’t be unfair to call this game brutal, but you’ll have unlimited continues in your disposal, along with a save point practically after every trap.The length of this game will vary depending on how good you are at it, a speed runner can do this in 20 minutes, a good player may get away with 2 hours, it took me around 12 hours to complete it entirely along with the hard mode.If you are someone who likes a real challenge, get this. If you’re a casual gamer who can’t take setbacks very well, please avoid it like the plague.			",522,140,15,40,28,10,55

												Although very simple, it's really addicting due its difficulty, but, most of this difficult, is just finding out the trick of each stage and their sections. The faults of the game that gets irritating are when, sometimes, the blue vortex fail to grab the character, or sometimes expel, and the other is the jump/jetpack, sometimes it doesnt work and sometimes activate right after jumping, killing the momentum. I managed to finish the game in the Hard Mode, and not because of that, I recommend, it's really worth a try.			",137,7,15,4,16,0,5

												Defy Gravity is a fairly minimalist 2D platformer. The game’s controls are very simple:•	You can jump.•	You can double jump in the air (with a cooldown between aerial jumps – but it is possible to jump more than once if you spend enough time in the air, such as if you’re in a gravity well).•	You can create a gravity well which sucks you (and gravity-sensitive objects) towards it. You can create one of these at a time, and have two shots before you need to touch the ground again.•	You can create an anti-gravity well which repels you (and gravity sensitive objects) away from it. You can create one of these at a time, and have two shots before you need to touch the ground again.•	You have a shield you can activate which prevents you from being affected by gravity (and in some levels, it is always on).The core gameplay mechanics are decent enough – the game has a very minimalist set of elements (platforms you can jump through (some of which move on their own, some of which fall down a few seconds after landing on them), enemies you can jump on top of to kill them and jump again, enemies you can’t bounce off of, and an enemy that kills you if you touch it which shoots other enemies which kill you if you touch them, and ground that kills you if you touch it). Everything in the game moves in linear, predictable paths. Some enemies can be affected by gravity wells (signified by them being gold-colored), others can’t (signified by them being gray); the same applies to the platforms.At its core, the game presents about an hour and a half of puzzles with these mechanics, and it is simple enough; it gets progressively more difficult the further you get into the game, and the last few levels are quite difficult. The game is mostly pretty generous with checkpoints, but the second to last level requires you to get through fairly long puzzles without screwing up.Once you beat the game, the game puts you back at the start in hard mode, in which you no longer have anti-gravity wells and all enemies are affected by gravity, which makes the game significantly more difficult. But the levels are the same as they were before, though I think there might be a few modifications to make it possible to solve some of the puzzles which require too many gravity well shots to solve otherwise.In any case, this core gameplay is decent enough, and while the game is quite short (about 90 minutes to beat the regular mode), it is probably about as long as it wants to be.The real weakness of this game is the fact that there is really nothing else here. The game is extremely simplistic, the graphics are clean and clear but pretty lackluster and not particularly pretty to look at, there is no story, and the levels feel clearly designed to be challenges without actually even bothering to feel organic in any way (which, ironically, may actually make sense, as the premise of the game is that you’re in there to… complete challenges…).Anyway, while this game has a fairly decent score on Metacritic, that is likely because, quite frankly, there’s not much to criticize here. But there’s not much to like, either; this game is extremely forgettable and I feel like I’m going to forget it within a very short period of time. The game never wows you, and that makes it hard to really love it or even care particularly much about it.All in all, this isn’t bad. But you can probably find a better use for an hour and a half (or three hours, if you really want to beat the hard mode and get 100% achievements) of your life. This game is simply unremarkable.

												I enjoyed this game because it's a very portal-esque platformer, except that it's much, much, much easier to die in this game than it is in Portal. In fact, dying is a good 70-90% of what you will do.Basically you play as a gravity-mancer, which is a person who uses a gravity gun to create bubbles of gravity and antigravity. With these bubbles, you will redirect yourself, platforms, enemies, and platform-enemies to try to survive a series of increasingly difficult puzzles. This game requires as much skill in execution as problem-solving, and is more fun to play than most $15 platformers out there with better graphics. On top of all that, it's cheap. If you like puzzles, platforming and difficulty, you should definitely buy this game.			",167,55,3,33,1,1,6

												Defy Gravity is a tiny little physics-based puzzle platformer in which you manipulate your movement through the creation of gravity and anti-gravity wells, allowing you to conquer assorted obstacles. Almost everything about the game is somewhat reminiscent of the big days of browser-based flash games. Fairly generic music loops, non-existent story, simplistic art style, and a pretty short length compared to most games on Steam (30-60 minutes for a basic playthrough, or 90-120 minutes if you're including all achievements/hard mode). The concept's not too bad, but the puzzle design is somewhat repetitive and the difficulty progression is very uneven (the final supposed-to-be-climactic puzzle is actually one of the easiest rooms in the game).Overall, there are plenty of worse ways to spend an hour or so. Defy Gravity is definitely worth the summer sale price of $0.29 - especially considering it comes with Steam Trading Cards which you can easily sell back for more than that. At full price, however, the cost is a bit steep for the paltry amount of content here. Grab it if it's on sale and you have a huge fetish for physics puzzles, or not at all.			",125,19,2,7,6,1,14

												+ Challenging, but fair puzzles+ Good music+ Charming- Short- The second half of the game is a copy of the first half, the difference being that you don't have access to one of your 2 powers.- Very basic sprite-based graphicsThis is an extremely charming game. It's a physics based platformer. The reason why it's so cheap is because it's a fairly short game (I have 100% on it, and I haven't been playing offline). You play as a sprite with the ability to shoot physics altering gravity and anti-gravity ""wells"". Think 2D Portal in which portals don't teleport you, they attract or repulse matter (including you). Apart from that theres a Bullet Bill jumping element to some puzzles, but imagine being able to influence their trajectory by shooting a well in the vicinity.Now, you gotta understand that Defy Gravity hasn't been made to look outstanding. I don't know what it is about it, but I can tell the devs were doing this out of love for making a game.Props to the music, it really clicks in with the puzzling around. There's no other notable sounds, the gun shooting is adequate.Graphics-wise... well its a 2D sprite game. It's also very blocky, and I do regret the dev's choice of font for the menus, but this is me nitpicking.The only true flaw this game has is how short it is. It's 24 levels with a hard mode for one more playthrough. It's arguably 48 levels long, but the difference between one half and the other is that you need to approach problems from a different perspective. A shame there is no climax to the game - it just abruptly ends.I say it's worth the price. I mean come on, it's the price of a cookie. Develop your brain instead of acquiring calories ;p. Just be sure that you're fine with dying a lot to find the solution. Don't worry though for the longer levels - there are frequent checkpoints (in my opinion too frequent).

												Fun game until after the 4th achievement, then it became hard as ♥♥♥♥, managed to get 5 achievements :)Also would have gotten my money (0.19 euro) back if I sold the trading cards I got, however, I chose to craft the badge.with that said, I'll give it a 10/10 because of its difficulty :B1:			",153,18,1,9,16,1,8

												Defy gravity is an indie puzzle/platform game that deserves more recognition. It has its own unique puzzle mechanic. You control two gravity portals that either pull you towards or repels you away to help you solve challenging and engaging puzzles. The game is $2.99 USD at the price for all that you're getting it's a freaking steal. If you liked portal I would pick up this indie game.

												Now this is a fun little game.  I don't think I've played any others quite like it.  With a clever use of gravity wells and repulsion wells, getting around these puzzles allows for multiple fun solutions.  Now, the game gets super difficult really fast. However, the controls and physics are so tight that when you master certain techniques, you feel like a real badass pulling them off.			",163,33,4,9,11,1,21

												This is a clever take on the platforming genre.You are a space man who can ""fire"" two kinds of level changing shots.  Either an area of gravity that will pull everything, including you, towards it, or an area of anti-gravity, that will push everything, including you, away from it.  You also can toggle on and off a gravity shield that makes you immune to your own and any naturally occuring gravity fields.  Also, you can only have two of any kind of gravity field up at a time, and you have keys to destroy them?Sound like a lot?For me it was a little clunky to ever be intuitive to play.  However, the challenge of figuring out each level was still interesting.  The music and art was not fantastic, but it wasn't terrible either.  There were also not many options to adjust the experience.Still, I appreciate the unique mechanics and what they are trying to do here.  Someone who likes platform games would probably enjoy this more than me.6/10			",36,5,1,4,0,0,8

												A 2D version of portal, with a little twist that really makes the game unique, not just another copy. Just a tiny tip : If you can't control your rage, I am not going to buy you new keyboards,mouses or controlers, got it ? coolGraphics - If you are not a sucker for great looking games, then you should have no problem with what this game has to offer, graphic wise. It has a rather strange style, by using textures from retro games and giving them a twist from textures from newer games, you get this, a strange looking game 7/10Music - The games strongest point, great choice by the Devs to put in calm and relaxing songs, while you are being irritated by dying at least a 100 times on a single level, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEVEL 9/10Story - You can't say this game does not a have a story, yes it is pretty small, but it still does. Like many games, you are the chosen but first you have to prove yourself by going through a variety of (let's call it chambers) till you get to the end. Just to be suprised that you have finished nothing, you just unlocked hard mode. OMAHGOD 6/10Content - Hmm, well 2-3 variations of enemies,  a lot of rooms (chambers) to pass, get's even more difficult the more you advance, but hey an interactive selection menu. 5/10Controls - Rather stiff movement, now you will say (but hey he is in a space suit, he is confined to certain movements), to which I will respond with (well in some games people wear armors that cover their whole bodies and they are still more maneuverable than he is). Plays almost the same on a keyboard+mouse or controler setup. 5/10Gameplay - The game runs at a normal rate, nothing too fast or too slow, you can have as much time as you want to think how you are going to do the certain challenge or how you would like to approach it. 7/10Overall the game is a fun time killer, for a few hours or like me for probably a few days, GODDAMMIT, either you are going pass it with no casualties or with, have fun xD   Overall score: 6.5/10			",143,38,8,29,12,2,24

												A nice puzzle platformer with a mechanic that feels very unique.You use a gun to push and pull yourself and certain objects to navigate through levels. Music is very nice with an atmospheric tone to it as well as the sound design. Honestly I sucked for the most part with this game so I ended up skipping through a bunch of levels even on hard mode lol. But I can tell you that this is a very good puzzle platformer if your in games like Braid and Portal.Rating: 9/10			",517,101,5,40,21,2,11

												A decent game. You play as an astronaut basically, and you have the ability to create and destroy gravity fields at will. Gravity fields that either pull you in or push you out.With that ability you have to navigate through very tricky levels involving lasers, moving platforms and various other obstacles. It's a bit low on the visual side however it makes up for that with the gameplay. It's extremely difficult to master and the levels are very very challenging. I'm a huge Super Meatboy Fan (even finished the Cotton Alley on A+) and I would say this is harder than meatboy.I recommend this game if you are looking for a challenge at a low price. It's interesting, it's difficult, and it will make you cry... It will probably also make you regret your decision to buy it and actually try to finish it because of how challenging it is.Give it a try :)			",420,129,7,33,29,7,46

												Defy Gravity Extended is an...uh...extended version of what was originally an Xbox Live Indie Game. I forget exactly what's different about this edition, aside from being a fair bit longer. Still, this is a game that can completed twice in about two hours (if you're going for all of the achievements).Everyone buys this game for the cards right? After all, this is one of those games that can be had for so cheap, players will profit just by owning it. While it's tempting to turn on idlemaster and do something else, IMO this is a game that is actually worth playing. The concept is interesting, the mechanics/controls are solid, and there's a fair amount of challenge to keep things engaging. The pleasant low-key soundtrack rounds everything out nicely. Defy Gravity Extended a pretty short game, so it didn't give me many opportunities to find things to complain about. Actually, I suppose the hit-box is a little too big, but the checkpoints are generous enough so it's not really a huge issue.Give it a go sometime.			",914,265,35,107,34,4,37

												Well, what can I say, sunk a total of three hours into this and all three were completely gratifying, you basically play an astronaut thas can push/pull himself through a myriad of obstacles using either gravity or anti-gravity portals you fire around you to gain advantage and pass to the next level, it has a very net yaroze feel I greatly enjoyed.Obviously, there are a few minor imperfections and if I'm to outline them briefly they'd outline the players ability to perform almost an infinite amount of double jumps in the air which makes a majority of these levels a breeze, there were only two real moments I felt a slight urge to rage quit and no doubt you'll experience them too, but I reccomend you push on through to the best of your abilities.The game is a great little time passer with moderate graphics, gameplay and music, definitley worth the eighteen pence I spent on it and brightened up my Saturday, my biggest dissapoinment which I'll hide behind a spoiler tag was that  once you've beaten the game you're introduced to the idea of a 'hard' mode, sadly, I found this much easier than the normal mode and some of the level recycling felt like a cheap, albeit enjoyable way to extend the game another hour and a half, though some will definitley lose their patience with the heavy trial and error segments of the game.Game on.

												--------------- Defy Gravity  ---------------        Defy Gravitiy is a 2D sidescroller puzzle game. The player takes on the roll of a Gravitymancer who uses a tool (similar to the portal gun from ""Portal"" which can fire a matter which pushes away objects or pulls them in) to overcome obstacles to reach the goal. The game isn't very long, but can be challenging. Once you do finish the game you'll be presented with the opportunity to replay it on a higher difficulty.______________________________________________________________      The game is ridiculously and worth buying. I'm sure your money will not be wasted. It also includes trading cards and achievements.			",154,30,0,20,10,0,18

												Defy Gravity is a fantastic platformer with great gameplay elements. This platformer utilizes gravity as the main mechanic. The player can create gravity and anti-gravity pockets to proceed through the levels. I would say that it has a similar difficulty curve as found within Portal, but it lacks story elements. Being a platfomer, however, it doesn’t require story elements, just quality controls. Graphically, it’s lacking, but having solid controls is what makes this game fantastic. This game also has a “Hard Mode”, which requires you to only use gravity pockets, and the enemies are affected by the gravity. This “Hard Mode” extends the gameplay you will find within Defy Gravity, but it doesn’t come off as too forceful. The only real reason to play through “Hard Mode” is to get all of the achievements. I will recommend this game to anyone looking for a new affordable experience.			",385,110,15,42,40,6,41

It's a puzzle platformer but the mechanics work kinda like Portal, you have a gun that shoots force energy thingys that either pull (blue) you or push you (orange). Also really nice wallpapers.

												Neat idea, but badly executed. Simple and repetitive graphics aside, the controls are wonky and don't feel right. Your character doesn't follow your cursor very quickly, and double-jumping robs you of all forward momentum for some reason. Most of the game's difficulty is caused by the counter-intuitive controls, and as soon as you get used to them the game is over in just a couple of hours.			",90,14,1,3,11,0,11

												I paid 0.29 cents on Summer sale 2014 for this game, even if I dont sell the cards, I'd say its more than worth this value just for the music alone.Besides that, its really a smart game, if I ran a school this is the game I'd let my primary section students fiddle around with.The Background scores can directly be played (wma) and can be found under local files : Sounds : Songs.

												4/5 - This game is great, I enjoy playing it, however, sometimes, the physics just sort of deny me, especially the gravity wells. Instead of pulling me in, they just sort of throw me away and deny me access. Other than that, this game is fantastic and would recommend this.			",46,3,1,8,5,0,0

												As with many of the people here, I bought the game during the steam summer sale for 18p. I wasn't expecting much from it, anything better than being completely and utterly broken would be nice.Defy Gravity is actually a basic but pretty good platformer with an overarcing mechanic, making 'gravity wells' that either attract or repulse you. It's difficult, but not difficult enough to get you over annoyed, always a hard balance to get in a platformer. The only real problem is the graphics, which aren't the greatest, but serviceable. Soundtrack's half-decent as well. Sold the trading cards for 22p, so made a profit from it.Overall, a cheap and cheerful indie game that can currently be bought for next to nothing. Worth it at the (admittedly low) full price.			",189,33,15,12,32,4,50

And it is just the perfect follow-up to the normal game... because by that point, you've become the master... and it explains how you no longer have anti-wells, and you think ""Oh dear this WILL be hard!"" And then you eventually master THAT, and then a level comes along that wipes that off the board...In summary, a challenging but VERY satisfying puzzle game with a perfectly executed...gimmick thing.Gravity!And this may be the only game I get 100% of achievements... and only for £0.09!

												An original and 'fun-to-play-for-a-while' puzzler! I have finished it twice to gain the last achievement for this game. A little repetitive because in Hard Mode there weren't that much differences (mostly the lack of anti-gravity production and the fact that all enemies/obstacles now react on gravity and come towards you). I only played it twice because I was in for a challenge and it became challenging at times. I'd say this game is nice for a brain training :) Recommended, even for the current price!

												If you are reading this on when the steam sales are still in, OMG, go and get this one and fast. You can see from the hour count it is not very long game, as I have beaten it once or even twice, can't realy remember... but that's the only downside of it - that it cant go any longer than it is!It is an Indie-2 dimensional puzzle game, very fun and relaxing yet not boring almost at any point. The story line - is not super evolved, as it is, a puzzle game. there is a small background explanation of the 'events' leading the player into the puzzle series, simple enough to make sense.The soundtrack - Unbelievably amazing. In fact, i haven't played this game for more than a few months now, and the reason i'm writing this is that i got on a loop of movies & video games OST, suddenly got back to the soundtrack of this game and remembered the fond memories i have from the music escorting me through the game levels as the get harder and harder. The tracks are neat, chill and relaxing and very fun to listen even outside the game. I'm almost sure i can speak for many when I say that the music is an undivided part of the actual gameplay.The Puzzles/levels - Very fun, despite the fact this game doesn't have crazy graphics. As I discovered, all you need is some obstacles and a nice gravity-controlling device to keep you grounded to the screen for 2-3 hours straight. Overall opinion: a good way of having fun in a relaxing puzzle environment, listening to good music and just taking a break from life. if you have some 'change' left on your steam wallet from big purchases and you're looking for something refreshing definitely go for this gem.

												An original and 'fun-to-play-for-a-while' puzzler! I have finished it twice to gain the last achievement for this game. A little repetitive because in Hard Mode there weren't that much differences (mostly the lack of anti-gravity production and the fact that all enemies/obstacles now react on gravity and come towards you). I only played it twice because I was in for a challenge and it became challenging at times. I'd say this game is nice for a brain training :) Recommended, even for the current price!

												Nice little puzzle game going with the theme of physics based utility guns. In Defy Gravity this gun is a device that creates gravity and anti-gravity fields. Player can also issue a shield against these special fields, which renders him (her?) immune to the fields but not the ""ordinary"" gravity. Strangely enough, some objects (it turns out they're the yellow ones) are affected by the fields while none of the others are.This makes for adequate puzzles: in any level you have to reach the end, while juggling between platforms and deadly blades. Dying is not a big issue: you'll respawn at a close-by platform and can continue right away. However, there are a couple of rather difficult spots, that might turn to be frustrating to get past.Then again the game is rather short. In mere 2.5 hours I completed both the base game and the hardmode that comes after, has more difficult levels and slightly different rules.If you like punishing puzzle platformers like Super Meat Boy or Adventures of Shuggy, this game is a nice snack (it even costs almost nothing). Musics are nice, and while there's no actual story, you will probably find it fun to be one of the universe's magnificent ""gravitomancers"".Regretfully, I encountered a couple of bad bugs along the way. First, the game freezes if you try to start a new game without having Windows Media Player installed. So, you have two options: install that or disable music (by -nomusic command line option). Another one was even more annoying: apparently some video cards (ATI Radeons) have a bug that the screen black-outs every once in a while. Very annoying issue. It would have been game-breaking, but it turns out at least I could work around it by doing double jumps (jumping in the air... so yeah) or going to Steam Overlay, both that repaint the screen. It does seem that the developers are looking into the issue, so hopefully it'll be fixed sometime in the future. It turns out the game was entirely completable and enjoyable despite these bugs though.			",3011,1260,77,374,381,26,452

												Defy Gravity is a platformer. You might say puzzle platformer, but I’d just call it a challenging platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy or Blood of the Werewolf, though Defy Gravity isn’t quite that infuriatingly difficult as those two. The gameplay was challenging enough to be rewarding but easy enough to be fun, I thought it was a good mix. The checkpoints were much better as well, being more frequent. If you die, you basically just start right before the last little challenge. Levels are fairly short. I think with SMB you have to start at the beginning of the level and BotW there are checkpoints but they can be pretty long at times. This game doesn’t really have any enemies either, besides some orbs, spiky orbs, and some sort of ships that shoot missiles or whatever. I don’t really remember about SMB, but BotW had more traditional enemies and super bosses. This didn’t have any of that. Mostly you are avoiding friggin laser beams on the floor or wall or ceiling. Sometimes you had to ride a platform through the level. The way it all works is that you have a duel gravity gun. You can shoot attractive gravity and reflective gravity. Attractive obviously pulls you toward it, so you can jump, shoot that and get sucked to it and then dispel it as you approach it to give you a little jump bust. Reflective will bounce you away, like a rocket jump. You have a double jump in the air. Pretty simple. You hold the LMB or RMB until you want it to stop, aim with the mouse. Movement with A/D. I don’t think a controller would help the controls, but they didn’t work bad. I think Q dispelled the attractive gravity, though it didn’t seem I could dispel reflective. Shift put up a gravity shield so they didn’t affect you. Sometimes a level would shoot it’s own gravity wells. The more challenging levels were when you had to ride the platform, which was propelled by your gravity gun, and also avoid everything else. Problem was that the platform would continue through walls if you weren’t careful, whereas you would not. Challenging. Presentation was pretty mediocre/cheap. It didn’t look BAD, but it was far from a pretty game too. I would recommend the game for people that like this type of game, especially for the price. It’s normally only 2$, which isn’t bad at all and it frequently goes on sale for like 90% off. I don’t mind it, but it’s not my favorite by far. So I played until I had the first three achievements (38%) for progress and then quit. I think it was about a half hour. There was no indication of what level I was on or how many there are total. Which is annoying as you don’t know how long the game is going to be. Though I suppose most games are that way, huh? ",633,245,17,61,52,12,65

												""Defy Gravity"" is a decent puzzle platformer with rather simple graphics but good controls.To complete the levels, you use your gun to create gravity or anti-gravity fields, pulling/pushing you and/or objects like balls, sawblades and small platforms.The gameplay is quite refreshing for such a small indie game, difficulty is well balanced with the learning curve and the hard mode you unlock after completing the game gives an extra challenge by completely deactivating the anti-gravity function of your gun for another playthrough.Even though the game is very short, I highly recommend to get it, especially at a reduced price.

												Ini salah satu Game Puzzle yang buat saya salah kaprah. Awalnya saya sangka game ini ""gampang ""  karena gameplay dan misinya cuman melewati beberapa rintangan seperti laser, bom dan lain lain. Namun level kesulitan bertambah naik, malah makin susah T_T dan harus putar otak untuk melewati step nya .Sountrack nya bagus cuman hanya itu itu saja.Grafik nya jadul dan lumayan buat game Puzzle.6.5/10 bagi saya Game ini cocok untuk pelepas stress.

												I bought this game on sale for something like 18p, but after having played it I would happily spend much more on it.It's a platform puzzle game that plays like games such as Braid etc. The in-game music is awesome and as I said at the start, even if you pay full price for this game you won't be dissapointed.

												I finished the game and it's hard mode. It's fun. It was a lot more fun than I thought I would have thought for a game I got for $0.50. It has an interesting concept that was fleshed out into a great puzzle game. The game is a little easier than what I would've liked, but it was still enjoyable (especially the hard mode). It has room for a sequel and I would probably buy that if it came out. Overall 9/10			",56,4,0,6,3,0,1

												Let's be honest here, Defy Gravity looks and plays like a crappy free flash game. However it's the case of ""you get what you pay for"".  It's hard not to recommend it, I bought the game for 0.19€ sold the cards and got 0.60€ back, so I actually got paid to play this game hehe.			",536,176,15,92,64,7,96

This game has alot of potential and I would love to see how a first-person shooter aspect of this game would work. Completly underated. 10/10 would recommend.			",62,11,0,3,10,0,6

												Lots of players are buying this game because of the low price - at sales usually it hits -90%, meaning that you'll probably profit from it's cards.But about the game itself: it's a good one. You control an astronaut (?) who has a special tool/weapon at his service: it can shoot two kinds of energy cores: one attracts things near itself, the another one repels. Sounds really basic, but the level design is really good, some levels require thinking and puzzle-solving skill, while other ones are more like  based on timing- and aiming.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, if you don't mind the simple graphics, it's a really well-executed puzzler-platformer game with medium-high difficulty.

												As someone who's played a fair share of platformers and puzzlers and has pretty defined opinions about design and what ""difficulty"" entails, this game started out as decently fun and interesting. I enjoyed the music, and the title screen background art got my expectations comfortably high. But quickly, it feels like the game runs out of ideas for level design using the gravity gimmick. It starts to feel like a mediocre free Flash browser game - long segments of jumping on a slow stream of orb enemies, repeated ""use gravity to drag this platform around"" bits, and a lot of areas where the solution to the puzzle is to simply use the same bruteforce technique a few times, because the inconsistent physics will net you a win. Some of the puzzles that brag difficulty turn out to be boring - you have to place a grav/anti well at a very precise point that you won't realize is wrong until a full 10 seconds pass, so you try just a little bit to the right, etc. A browser Flash puzzle platformer game is the best comparison really, because of the inconsistent physics and drawn out level design characteristic of them. And the ""ultimate challenge,"" which is the game's sort of newgame+ hardmode, serves to limit your options to make levels feel even less creative to pass by removing anti-grav wells, and makes all enemies physics-based, allowing the often shoddy engine to make your play even less consistent than your first run. Ultimately, I gave up on that because I was bored, not challenged. Games like La-Mulana will leave you feeling challenged by the puzzles and platforming. Or, perhaps this game will as well. A lot of people seem to like the game, but I would have been bored of it if it were freeware. A lot of positivity about this game seems to repeatedly refer to the price point. A game at a comparably low price point which I will recommend in Defy Gravity's stead is Super Hexagon, a challenging game that tests skill rather than the sheer snoring patience required of Defy Gravity. Or maybe I'm wrong and don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about video games.			",104,6,1,7,6,2,5

												This game if a fun platformer game, I don't know if I am bad at games or it is hard, I find it hard to win but I have so much fun when i play this game. The fact that's is super cheap on sales ( I bought it for 0.19€), combined that it's really fun makes me recommend this game. BTW I didn't want to mention it but ♥♥♥♥ it, with this game if you buy it cheaply you can make 4 times more money by cards of the money you actually paid to buy this game. I would really like if they added a level creator with workshop support, or add some powerups and custom player editing and all of this could support the workshop.			",110,10,1,9,5,0,12

Well.The graphics looks low, but it's ok for a indiegame like this.Atm i played 1hour+ and the gameplay gets even harder, i think this is one of the most important ""+"" i can give.You need skill, a little bit luck and a lot of time to master all the level, so don't buy this game if you can't handle with these fact!I read a lot of reviews, and sorry, i can't say: ""The soundtracks are bad"" or something else.I love the soundtracks, its an good old-school ""indie-sound"" who bring me down if i start to rage, because i failed a few millimeter in front of the next platform ;)So i give 9/10 Points because i miss a ""options""-buttonTry it, its more game for a few cent as some others!Ps: Sorry for my bad english, i'm german and all i can is eat some weißwurst and sauerkraut ;D			",225,41,2,40,17,1,29

												For the price, Defy Gravity has a pretty good level of content and quality. The music in this game really helps to set the atmosphere, allowing players to focus on the challenges ahead of them and making the overall experience more enjoyable. This is by no means a horribly difficult game, but at the same time it's not too easy either. I could easily see this as a game to play with friends, if multiplayer was enabled and I think it would be quite a lot of fun. I bought the game for only 29 cents, and it has proven to definitely be a worthwhile purchase. Even if you don't like it, Defy Gravity isn't an expensive game, so it wouldn't be much of a loss to your walletSo basically, if you're into atmospheric or ambient music, love platformers/puzzlers and are a fan of relatively challenging games, then this is for you.

												Summary: better than Portal.The thing you need to understand about Defy Gravity is not that it is good, play for a few minutes and you will understand that, no what you need to understand is that this is better than the Portal series.It doesn't try to beat you over the head with ""humour"" like Portal. It doesn't try to draw you into an un-funny joke. Instead this gives you puzzles to be solved with platforming and using your gravity gun and quick reflexes. A lot of thought has gone into it, so it will challenge but is beatable; and it was a pleasant joy to play. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very very good platformer game. Only played about 30mins and got 11 levels done, until they told that the hard part was comming, and i begin to get rly excited, and scared from the future frustration that i'll need to fight. And it rly got harder.So the point of the game is go to Point A to Point B using platforms, using your gravity gun to create ""platforms""(one to atract and the other to push away) or even bring the golden balls/platforms to whethever you want them to be, so as you can see, you may complete these levels in different ways, even going at the top of a map. You'll need to dogde balls , but you may jump on them ,making them usefull in levels, or even making them necesary, but you'll need to dodge the shuriken, and be carefull of the gold ones :). Another thing that i love of this game is its difficulty spike that it has after level 11-12, as i already told you.And the soundtrack, some of them are EPIC and other meh(dubstep) but ofc that's my opinion. What would i have liked to seen is some story, background , but still this is good, giving it a 8/10, recommend to all platformers guys or just normal guys who for 0,19€/2€ may wanna spend an hour or so.(And i would like to see this game have a community that make levels, would totally be cool having  User-Created levels in this game.)

												At first sight you may think this game is pretty horrible, but I gotta say, after the first levels you gotta have patience to continue and succeed. It's pretty tough in the last levels! I, myself, am blocked a bit after the mid levels.Plus this game isn't that complicated to play, only 5 keys, the left and the right click and that's it!This is definitly not a bad game, go check it out !

												Cool platformer. A lot of unique gameplay elements. I really enjoyed the cool gravity mechanic, and the game kept introducing new ideas until the end. The unique platformer with great physics that never disapoints. It has a hard mode for tryhards and a funky soundtrack.The only thing it lacks is good story but the gameplay makes up for it. I would love to see more from its creators.With one playthrough taking between three and infinity hours, and an unlockable Hard mode to look forward to, you could play this game forever.

Only played about 30mins and got 11 levels done, until they told that the hard part was comming, and i begin to get rly excited, and scared from the future frustration that i'll need to fight.

												Although Defy Gravity Extended can be bought at a really cheap price, the game is not ""cheap"" at all. I enjoyed every single minute of it. Made after a pretty basic mechanic, the game offers a decent amount of gameplay time and it also feature trading cards, which will make you back the money you spend on the game. I never thought I'll find it interesting, but as you progress, the levels become more bigger, more interesting and even the puzzles are starting to be a little bit harder.Why would I recommend this game? Because the developer knows how to deal with the market and understands that using basic mechanics in a good way can turn his platformer in a appreciated game that will make people try it out just because it's a catchy game (not only because of the price)! I wish I could say something bad about it, but at this price, I don't know what do you expect. Frankly, I consider this to be the best cheap game on Steam at the moment. And by ceap I mean under two euro!			",86,12,5,4,3,0,11

												First let me make one thing clear. I hate platform games, I'm rubbish at them and they drive me up the wall.Now we have that out the way. I paid £0.09 for this in the 2014 Christmas sale, buying it as many did for the trading cards which were worth more than the game itself. I expected to leave the game running in the background for the cards and that I would be done with it.Well, actualy no. As it turns out this is a good game. Yes it is a platformer and yes it did drive me mad at points. The game while not easy is asscessable for those not of the platform minded. When you die you rarely have to restart that far away from death and the nature of the game with your gravity gun the is rarely need for pin point jumping and landing. No timers, no lives limit, no scoreboards with the simple goal of reaching the end of each level to reach the next.Played for 30-40mins completed about a 1/3rd of the game, 2 or 3 parts = many, many deaths that took a few mins to get right. Other than that an enjoyable plesant suprise.Graphics = Circa late 90sMusic = InoffensiveSFX = Not the bestControls = GoodTutorial = GoodValue = Exceptional@ the current price of £0.09 anyone and everyone regardless of there prefered game genres should buy this game without hesitation.

												Really intense platformer.Unlike supermeatboy, there will be times where you can stop and think. However it isnt like braid... once you are done thinking, the actions must be fast. Mixing both puzzle solving with fast execution.Basicly aside all normal platform stuff (jumping, platforms lol, things to avoid, etc) you have a gun that creates a repel field or a pull field. You must click. hold. shoot. so it aint simple as portal, for when you release, the gravity field stays. This means that you just dont shoot, you gota hold until the field is where you want... picture that while falling...The difficulty here is the amount of commands. Basicly you use more than 6 commands. You have jump, double jump (which recharges while falling), you have a repel field, a pull field, a cancel field, a immune to gravity effects barrier, plus all platform basic stuff.The thing is, you are sometimes expected to use alot in a really short time. so a difficult puzzle would go, jump, repel, double jump, pull field, cancel, repel, jump. Its just alot to control in a short intense amount of time.I definetly recommend it, but be aware its not your average casual puzzle... imo its a damn great puzzle and something i personally been waiting for (intense command/execution puzzles).

												The animations in this game are at most decent. It's rather easy for platformer game and it doesn't have anything that could surprise fans of this genre... but while I was playing Defy Gravity Extended I had a nostalgia attack. It really remind me of few really old, mostly pre 2000, simple games. I remembered all of good times I spent playing those simple, shareware or freeware, games - without fancy graphics, with short but enjoyable music, focusing only on gameplay not some story. And it was really fun. When it's on sale, it's really cheap - you will be able to get most of your money back from selling cards. I was really surprised by this game and it should be at least tried by everyone, since you spend very little money on it and it can truly bring you few hours of fun.			",1736,715,60,244,224,20,321

A mix of platformer and easy puzzles (if you can even call it that)My only real gripe about the game is how you control the gravity orb things. The longer you hold M1, the farther it goes before it stops and activates, which is ok, but when lots of things are flying at you, sometimes you just forget.			",105,46,1,14,11,1,11

												I highly recommend this game. Here are the reasons:I bought it when it was 90 percent off, gained 3 trading cards, sold them, made profit so this game is completely free to playIt offers you a 2 hours of fun, levels are enjoying and getting harder when you are also getting more experience and 2 enjoying hours are really enough for a free to play game in my opinionEarning Steam achievements so fast is a great feeling. It has 8 achievements, i played one and half an hour and earned 7 of them. If you are bored about impossible achievements in games, this game offers you a great achievement progress experienceAfter completing all levels, game offers you a new challenging mode: hard mode, which contains same levels with some restrictionsAll in all, this game offers you a great, enjoying moments, according to its price. ""According to its price"" is the most important part of this review, if this game's price were more than 1 dollar, i would not recommended it.			",61,6,1,1,8,1,6

												Defy Gravity is a decent puzzle platformer. The gravity orbs don't always work as intended and at some places there is a lot of trial & error, but I had fun with this game. However, I stopped my playthrough after 45 minutes (roughly 60%) because the game started annoying me. At this point the game tells you that it becomes harder, and yes - it is, in a specific way. It's not really the level design which becomes more difficult to beat, it's your sanity. There are less checkpoints and they are horribly placed.The passages are not difficult to figure out, the game just reduces itself to trial & error. After each respawn you have to wait up to 10 seconds for the enemies or platforms to move so you can continue. Usually I die and then I think ""Whatever, I'll just try again"". I reached the point where I just Alt + F4 out of the game after the 10th death because the game makes me wait longer than I actually have fun with it. It just feels like a punishment for bad playing which is inappropriate for a game like this. Or it's just really bad level design.At least I had 30 minutes of fun. I bought it for 9 cents and I sold each of the 3 trading cards for 8 cents. The game is worth a try, but don't expect too much.			",634,216,23,81,65,7,90

When i purchase the game it was only 0,19€ and just for that when the game is so cheap you should buy it and you can make a little profit with the trading cards.			",435,250,12,44,38,3,56

												Defy Gravity is a puzzle game with a simple mechanic. You have a jetpack and a gun which manipulates gravity, and with this equipment you have to get to the other side of the room, avoiding obstacles using your gun, the jetpack or the enviorenment. It's not long but it can take a few hours to beat (4-5 for average players). The best thing about the game is the soundtrack, it will accompany you and turn something that could be very boring and frustrating into something interesting. I think it fits with the game, and personally I find the soundtrack very peaceful. For an indie developer with that people (during the credits i counted 6 or 7), the final result is impressive. It's cheap (2,99) but if you find it with a 95% sale, you will even get a profit with the trading cards!			",171,26,3,17,4,0,11

Its pretty fun and I got it on a 95% sale which cost 0.17 cents in SGD, so its very worth it, plus I believe (even though I have not complete the game) all achievements all be unlock when you complete the game, and there's also steam cards for this.In summaryits pretty fun and challenging if you like platformers			",172,51,2,20,20,1,15

												For the price, it isn't a bad purchase. It was fun to playthrough and some levels were quite challenging. The controls are a bit weird to use, but you get used to it. It's a gravity-based platformer with some nice features like gravity shield and anti-gravity. You control gravity to your advantage and you have to reach the door to the next level in every zones to progress. There's a checkpoint system in place too, so the is less frustating.To be fair, this game isn't the best, so if you have no games to play and are bored, might want to pick this one up.PROs:-Fun.-Easy to get started.-Very cheap.CONs:-Music is repetitive and cannot be muted.-Some levels are just alot harder than others ( at random points in the game, not really in the end. )-Game is completed in 3 hours.-Low quality graphics.

												100% the game in 3-4 hours. Pretty short, but if you get it on a sale, it's only a dime + pennies. A mix of platformer and easy puzzles (if you can even call it that)My only real gripe about the game is how you control the gravity orb things. The longer you hold M1, the farther it goes before it stops and activates, which is ok, but when lots of things are flying at you, sometimes you just forget.			",105,46,1,14,11,1,11

												Defy Gravity is a decent puzzle platformer. The gravity orbs don't always work as intended and at some places there is a lot of trial & error, but I had fun with this game. However, I stopped my playthrough after 45 minutes (roughly 60%) because the game started annoying me. At this point the game tells you that it becomes harder, and yes - it is, in a specific way. It's not really the level design which becomes more difficult to beat, it's your sanity. There are less checkpoints and they are horribly placed.The passages are not difficult to figure out, the game just reduces itself to trial & error. After each respawn you have to wait up to 10 seconds for the enemies or platforms to move so you can continue. Usually I die and then I think ""Whatever, I'll just try again"". I reached the point where I just Alt + F4 out of the game after the 10th death because the game makes me wait longer than I actually have fun with it. It just feels like a punishment for bad playing which is inappropriate for a game like this. Or it's just really bad level design.At least I had 30 minutes of fun. I bought it for 9 cents and I sold each of the 3 trading cards for 8 cents. The game is worth a try, but don't expect too much.			",634,216,23,81,65,7,90

												I highly recommend this game. Here are the reasons:I bought it when it was 90 percent off, gained 3 trading cards, sold them, made profit so this game is completely free to playIt offers you a 2 hours of fun, levels are enjoying and getting harder when you are also getting more experience and 2 enjoying hours are really enough for a free to play game in my opinionEarning Steam achievements so fast is a great feeling. It has 8 achievements, i played one and half an hour and earned 7 of them. If you are bored about impossible achievements in games, this game offers you a great achievement progress experienceAfter completing all levels, game offers you a new challenging mode: hard mode, which contains same levels with some restrictionsAll in all, this game offers you a great, enjoying moments, according to its price. ""According to its price"" is the most important part of this review, if this game's price were more than 1 dollar, i would not recommended it.			",61,6,1,1,8,1,6

												Very very good platformer game. Only played about 30mins and got 11 levels done, until they told that the hard part was comming, and i begin to get rly excited, and scared from the future frustration that i'll need to fight. And it rly got harder.So the point of the game is go to Point A to Point B using platforms, using your gravity gun to create ""platforms""(one to atract and the other to push away) or even bring the golden balls/platforms to whethever you want them to be, so as you can see, you may complete these levels in different ways, even going at the top of a map. You'll need to dogde balls , but you may jump on them ,making them usefull in levels, or even making them necesary, but you'll need to dodge the shuriken, and be carefull of the gold ones :). Another thing that i love of this game is its difficulty spike that it has after level 11-12, as i already told you.And the soundtrack, some of them are EPIC and other meh(dubstep) but ofc that's my opinion. What would i have liked to seen is some story, background , but still this is good, giving it a 8/10, recommend to all platformers guys or just normal guys who for 0,19€/2€ may wanna spend an hour or so.(And i would like to see this game have a community that make levels, would totally be cool having  User-Created levels in this game.)

This game has a stellar soundtrack, simple graphics, and the game mechanics work in a way that isn't to confusing and is enjoyable to play. Some puzzles you'll complete in 30 seconds, while others may take you 10 to 15 minutes. I absolutley LOVE this game, it totally surprised me.

												First let me make one thing clear. I hate platform games, I'm rubbish at them and they drive me up the wall.Now we have that out the way. I paid £0.09 for this in the 2014 Christmas sale, buying it as many did for the trading cards which were worth more than the game itself. I expected to leave the game running in the background for the cards and that I would be done with it.Well, actualy no. As it turns out this is a good game. Yes it is a platformer and yes it did drive me mad at points. The game while not easy is asscessable for those not of the platform minded. When you die you rarely have to restart that far away from death and the nature of the game with your gravity gun the is rarely need for pin point jumping and landing. No timers, no lives limit, no scoreboards with the simple goal of reaching the end of each level to reach the next.Played for 30-40mins completed about a 1/3rd of the game, 2 or 3 parts = many, many deaths that took a few mins to get right. Other than that an enjoyable plesant suprise.Graphics = Circa late 90sMusic = InoffensiveSFX = Not the bestControls = GoodTutorial = GoodValue = Exceptional@ the current price of £0.09 anyone and everyone regardless of there prefered game genres should buy this game without hesitation.

												Really intense platformer.Unlike supermeatboy, there will be times where you can stop and think. However it isnt like braid... once you are done thinking, the actions must be fast. Mixing both puzzle solving with fast execution.Basicly aside all normal platform stuff (jumping, platforms lol, things to avoid, etc) you have a gun that creates a repel field or a pull field. You must click. hold. shoot. so it aint simple as portal, for when you release, the gravity field stays. This means that you just dont shoot, you gota hold until the field is where you want... picture that while falling...The difficulty here is the amount of commands. Basicly you use more than 6 commands. You have jump, double jump (which recharges while falling), you have a repel field, a pull field, a cancel field, a immune to gravity effects barrier, plus all platform basic stuff.The thing is, you are sometimes expected to use alot in a really short time. so a difficult puzzle would go, jump, repel, double jump, pull field, cancel, repel, jump. Its just alot to control in a short intense amount of time.I definetly recommend it, but be aware its not your average casual puzzle... imo its a damn great puzzle and something i personally been waiting for (intense command/execution puzzles).

												The animations in this game are at most decent. It's rather easy for platformer game and it doesn't have anything that could surprise fans of this genre... but while I was playing Defy Gravity Extended I had a nostalgia attack. It really remind me of few really old, mostly pre 2000, simple games. I remembered all of good times I spent playing those simple, shareware or freeware, games - without fancy graphics, with short but enjoyable music, focusing only on gameplay not some story. And it was really fun. When it's on sale, it's really cheap - you will be able to get most of your money back from selling cards. I was really surprised by this game and it should be at least tried by everyone, since you spend very little money on it and it can truly bring you few hours of fun.			",1736,715,60,244,224,20,321

												Defy Gravity is a very cool game! Your only weapon is a ""gravity gun"", which allows you to attract or repusle you and some monsters. With that only weapon, you have to beat the levels of the gauntlet to become the best GravityMancer. I played this game 2 hours, but haven't finished it yet, because when you finish the game, you unlock the hardcore mode (only attracting gun).			",72,5,0,2,4,2,4

												To defy gravity means to not have gravity apply to the person.You could defy gravity in space although there is no gravity besides the gravity pulling you closer to the sun at a very slow rate. But other than that one main pull of gravity in space there is no gravity. Defying gravity therefore would be physically impossible without the help of external sources, such as airplane, jetpack, rocketship. If you were to defy gravity you would need to be able to bend Earth at it's will, deforming it's surface, messing with it's gravitational field, and messing with weather consistency.In the end it is physically impossible to defy gravity therefore meaning that this game is a hoax.

Levels are hard sometimes.Graphics are too simple. (if you don't like 2D games)Animations are almost nonexistent.Very puzzling.(also a pro)IN CONCLUSION:I'm very neutral about this game. It's cool, relaxing, but also has a fair share of cons.Honestly, I recommend it, but don't buy it unless it's on sale. It's not worth $2.I got it for 29c and didn't expect much, but it did and does amaze.TO SUM IT UP___________|Concept|Rating||Music     .|Great.||Design   .|Eh     .||Puzzling?|Very . ||Fun?      .|Very  .||Graphics|Bad   .||Animat.. |Bad   .||Price      .|Cheap.|OVERALL:I reccomend it, but it's your decision.

												I got this game off scrap.tf and it is an absoulute bargain. I enjoy it, I enjoy how hard it is, I enjoy how easy it is. I love the simplicity of the graphics. The music fits so well with each level, whether it is hectic or relaxed. However, there is always a catch. The first few levels were a bit repetitive, but once you get to the harder levels it is not repetitive at all, which I find nice. Overall, I give this game an 8/10. If the developer were to add anything, if there was a ""Defy Gravity 2"", it should be a bit more complex.			",70,10,5,5,21,0,6

												I bought it for the lols because it was on sale for like one cent. It's an extremely frustrating game, and the last level is pretty much as close to impossible as you can get (I ended up giving up, it simply wasn't worth the reward of getting 100%). But seeing as I got 4 hours from it, I have to recommend it. Graphics are hella shoddy though.			",103,15,4,10,12,1,6

												It's a great game.

I don't know, i just felt like that the last set of levels weren't necessary.8.5/10I would reccomend			",190,52,1,14,10,2,18

												Defy Gravity. Its a simple enough game. making good use of gravity defying forces to pass through the levels. Its really just as simple as that. Its definitely challenging though as your astronaut isnt the easiest to control. I tried using both Keyboard and mouse & the Xbox gamepad with this one and found that either way, if your control isnt perfect then your gonna have a bad time. Thats not to say the challenge is unfair though. You dont feel cheated for failing here which marks the sign of a game developer that knows what they are doing. The music whilst sounding pretty basic actually helps the ambience of the game aswell. Its nothing to get excited about. it just seems to fit quite well with the kind of game this is. Maybe abit to boring for me but I can definitely see the good sides to this game, and it has alot more going for it then it does against it. At the end of the day, When all is said and done. I'd say for the cheap price its available at, Its not a bad idea if you need something to tide you over for a few hours.			",35,7,0,11,4,0,6

												Defy Gravity is a very cool game! Your only weapon is a ""gravity gun"", which allows you to attract or repusle you and some monsters. With that only weapon, you have to beat the levels of the gauntlet to become the best GravityMancer.

												The game is actually one of my favourite puzzle games atm, due to it's unique gameplay mechanics, it'll give you from 2-4 hours of gameplay depending on how long it takes you to finish the challenges. It is however somewhat difficult at parts adding more thought process and skill are added into the equation to create a fantastic gameplay experience! I'm very glad that I bought this. I would buy this on or off sale (i bought it during a sale).The only downside is the music :/ made me question my sanity...			",67,2,0,1,3,0,4

												Just got this game, and I've played through about half of it, and I keep thinking how much I would have loved this game as a kid.  It has the right feel for an old-school platformer, but it is a puzzle game rather than a shooting game.  It's designed like a classic 2-D sidescrolling platformer, but the trick is that you have a gun that creates two types of gravity fields.  One pulls you, and one repels you (along with some obstacles).  This makes it feel in some ways like a 2D version of Portal at times, although the feel is very different.  I am breezing through the game so far, but I have played a lot of puzzlers and platformers over the years and don't usually find them challenging anymore.  I think an average player would find this game very challenging, and it certainly is inventive.  So far, everything about the game is good from what I can tell, with one exception.  The aiming mechanic on a gamepad is a little hard to fine tune, and it's especially hard to aim when in motion on a gamepad.  This is bad as some of the puzzles are best solved with mid-air field placement.  Meanwhile, the usual gripes I have with this kind of game (bad hit detection, erratic controls, poor optimization, graphics glitches, etc) aren't an issue here.  The game feels pretty solid with the single exception of the aiming system.  Pretty good game.			",175,41,6,32,22,4,50

												First of all let me start by saying: This game is an absolute gem.I've bought this game for 0.19 cent and was amazed how good this game is.The goal of this game is to get from point A (start) to point B (finish).This game is a challanging platformer that involves jumping around using a sequence of abilities (E.g gravity portals).I love the mechanics in this game, they're very simple to understand and there are a lot of ways to play and win the game.You can use a mix of different abilities to win and are free to choose which playstyle you like better, I was amazed that such a simple game can offer you such a nice way to beat it.Overall if you like simple (but casual & extremely fun) games, this is the game for you.Pros:- Simple yet varsitile in-game mechanics- Very fun & satisfying (worth your money for sure!)- Extremely cheap (when on sale) - BUT I would say without a doubt worth its full price!- Surprisingly beautiful sound track!- Has achievements (not the most important)- Has trading cards (not the most important)Cons:- Game is extremely short (although is it very cheap, still very short, I was sad)- No DLC (would definitly buy dlc if there was one)As a person who loves playing big titel games with great visual effects I still was amazed how fun and satisfying this game was, would recommend this game for all kinds of gamers at any age.

												I'm among those many people who bought this game just because it has a ridiculously low price and the card drops have a higher value, but it was a pleasant surprise. I actually enjoy the game, and I'm not a big fan of platformers. The music is good and catchy. I ended up buying more cards to craft the badge.Totally recommended.			",193,340,3,68,36,2,46

												Defy gravity is one of those titles that can really (and I mean Really) get you hooked up to your monitor. Not in that classical ""Oh I lost track of my life in this masterpiece of a thing"" way. In fact, if you are that type of gamer, unless you love to get frustrated, this game is most certainly not for you. That said, if you indeed want a game that increases your levels of stress and frustration, and leads you to a path of self destruction, by all means buy the thing.I'm actually writing this review after a short session, in the hope of finding the magnificence of this piece. And guess what? Got surprisingly frustrated and full of strong emotions that made me swear like a sailor.

												Ok, so whenever a decent looking puzzle game is only $0.29 on Steam you need to buy it.When I purchased Defy Gravity, I said to myself “If it stinks, I’ll just sell the Trading Cards and make a profit”, like everyone seems to be doing these days.  After putting only an hour into this game, I have to say it’s actually worth more than what I paid. The game style and play might not be for everyone but it’s definitely worth a try.  I just love how the color of the gravity/repulsion wells, and the gravity gun itself remind me of Portal.Bottom line... it a great little game.			",61,1,0,6,1,1,7

However, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun the game actually is.Not only did I beat the game in one sitting, but I bought a few more copies to share with friends.The endgame (hard mode) will provide another hour or two of difficult and frustrating platforming.Profitable, fun, and unique. 11/10 ",146,34,3,12,11,0,11

												Defy Gravity was a game I was pleasantly suprised by. I picked it up for about $0.20 on a sale, and overall, it's a good game.  The game revolves around the use of a gun that shoots gravity wells, the blue gravity well, which attracts things, and the orange anti-gravity well, which repels things. This is a quite fun concept, and is used quite well. Now, if a gun that shoots one of each orange and blue glowy vaguely round objects to progress through a series of puzzles in some sort of challenge course sounds familiar to you at all, that's probably because it sounds a lot like Portal. However, it is actually quite different from Portal. No puzzle has one specific solution, and feels more of a skill-based platformer than a puzzle game. The puzzles are fairly loosely designed, so you can solve them in your own particular style. The game also looks nice, and the music is quite amazing. And after you beat the game, it starts Hardmode, which is implemented in a quite interesting way. Instead of just giving you trickier puzzles or a limited number of wells, it gives you the same puzzles, slightly modified, all enemies are affected by gravity, and you can only use regular gravity wells. This really caught me off guard, because for most of the game, I was using tha Anti-Wells in a sort of rocket jump way to clear the levels. I had to change up my playstyle, and it was kind of cool. However, my biggest problem with Defy Gravity is the bugs. These weren't just small things, they happened every single time I played. When I start the game, I always need to close out of it in task manager and start it again before the graphics will work, and on some levels you need to shoot a gravity well off before the graphics will start, which can get very irritating, especially if there's an enemy nearby. But despite these problems, I enjoyed it. It's creative and fun. If you can pick it up for a few bucks, I say get it. And thank me for not using a Wicked joke throughout this whole review.

												Simple and easy are two words to describe this game,is really fun,the graphics are what you can expect from an indie platformer,the music gets catchy after a while,which is good.The gameplay is easy,WASD,Q,E and the mouse,if you want to play a Portal-like game,this can be for you,it makes you think outside of the box,mostly because there's not only one way to clear the levels,it depends on how you think and how fast you can think.I recommend this game a lot,it's really fun and entertaining.

												Holy hell if that isnt a tough game. The initial levels took me about 30 minutes to go through but hard mode try an hour and a half. So here's my feelings on the game in 3 catagories...Gameplay:The gameplay is fun and easy to grasp, each level offers a new challange. The early levels are easy but as I got to the last 5 it took a few deaths to formulate a strategy. The gravity gun is a very interesting mechanic, left click fires a blue ball that sucks things in and the right click was an orange ball that pushed things away. I like the idea and would love to see the same concept done in a 3d environment. Overall, the mechanics were smooth and no glitches occured.Graphics:Not really an important part of this game as I'd have been just as happy with 8bit. The graphics are smooth and made for 1080p screens. The animations are basic with very few frames but this isnt really a con to the game. Really I think the artwork done for this game fit the theme and looked rather good for what it is.Sound:The music for this game is rather nice, one moment its calm and relaxing and then in some levels the music speeds up a bit for escape levels. One nice thing I'd like to note is that the sound enemies make when they bounce off of walls is there but not distracting. That I believe is very important and I'm very happy that they were careful about the volume of that ting noise they make.Overall I can definately recomend this game to casual and hardcore gamers alike. 10/10			",152,39,3,27,15,1,9

												This is a nice short game with a good soundtrack.The concept on which it is based is very interesting, although it could be better implemented. You use your gun to create gravity or anti-gravity wells in order to make your way through the levels.Gravity is hard to manipulate and it can get frustrating to try so many times before succeeding, relying a bit too much on luck with the timings and the hard-to-predict behaviour of the wells.The controls are easy enough (although I had some trouble with the jumping, as it would only jump after I ran off the edge) and, again, the soundtrack is quite good.The graphics, however, aren't the best around, even though I believe the look somewhat agrees with the game. Nevertheless, the game is visually consistent and the space setting is always pleasing.With all that said, I found the game to be nice, but also frustrating and somewhat boring after a while. The good thing, though, is that it is short.All in all, it is a fun, short-lived experience, if you can keep your cool after dying so many times on the same spot because your gravity well didn't pull you well enough. I recommend you give it a try, especially since you can get it very cheap on sale.			",339,111,5,53,29,3,21

Morlan's shorts:A little space-suited fella (might be a lass, not sure, I couldn't notice lipstick, lip gloss, eye shadow or eyeliner though. Hm.. a tad much to know about the female appearance! Anyhow just kidding because the info says that it actually is a girl, named Kara) that uses a gravity gun to pull-push objects, avoid lethal robots/lasers/varied baddies and reach the final destination..A seemingly simple run'n'jump('n'gravitate-yourself) arcade-puzzle-ish type of game but with increasingly difficult levels the last of which will require very precise movements, use of all your experience from the early ones and some degree of luck to finish them..The graphics are simple yet nicely detailed and effective in conveying the atmosphere of the game and there's an accompanying soundtrack that's easy to listen and doesn't get too repetitive or boring.Last achievement is quite hard to accomplish and you could reach rage-quitting levels..but in the end it's' worth the satisfying feeling that..you made it!It was one of the first games I bought here and the first one I finished, but I only care about that. Nothing to see here.. keep walkingI give it BFG out of CIA!Final Verdict: Non-roman thumbie: 👍 !Don't waste more time reading lengthy reviews.. time is of the essence! ",557,287,10,56,35,6,96

												It's a fun puzzle game that involves some thinking in order to proceed but it's easy to figure out. Once you reach the real gauntlet(hard mode) the play style starts to change and the real challenge begins. It kept me busy for a couple of hours and i'm still trying to complete Hard mode, lol.

Takes a little effort and skills to go through late game, so you'll either end up enjoying it, or have more hair-pulling rage moments then you expect.Not bad to kill time when taking a break from the usual power gaming. But if you ask me, it should've been free, and not worth paying for. You can grab it when it's on sale, otherwise, there are way too many other options to choose from.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defy Gravity is one of the worst games I've ever played. The idea itself is not bad: armed with a gravity gun, you have to make your way through all kind of (jumping) puzzles. Not enterily original, but still.But. Almost everything else about this game is awful. Sorry for the harsh words, but I find no others means to describe my feelings during playing. Controls are very, very poor, which is disastrous for this kind of game. I played it on an Xbox360 controller, which should be fine, but alas, no.Graphics are even worse - even in the 1980's, games looked way better. Sound is almost non-existent.The only reason I can see to buy this game, is for the trading cards and the xp when you craft the badge. The game is, understandably, very, very cheap, so you can even make a few eurocents if you sell the cards. Oh, there are Steam achievements too, but I gave up after under an hour out of sheer frustration.No detailed rating, but surely only 3/10 or so - and that's just for the cards. Otherwise, it would be even less.			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												Steering away from all of the ""Made a profit off of the cards,"" reviews, this game was probably one of my favorite platformers ever.

												For now - the cheapest game i've ever seen, cheaper is only a free one.So ""pluses"":+ A good game for having a rest. + Good musiс set. Though it has only several glees, they remind me the 80th-90th - the songs of space theme improve the environment.+ The game makes you think about your tactics and rapidity, that's why you should strain your logics.+ Short levels and frequent autosaves - that will help you not to break you pc, when you try to handle a level.And minuses:- Sometimes the character doesn't jump, but i don't know whether it is a bug or i do something wrong.- The cost justifies the game itself - rather short, but i don't think that the aim of the game was to involve you for many hours. Just to pass it through once and then play just when you don't know what to do.If you are a game collector - buy it. If you like arcades - buy it. If you like space songs reminding the 80th - buy it. A fortiori that it costs only $0.07 when it is on sale.			",48,1,1,6,1,0,6

												This game is actually a fairly enjoyable experience. The game mechanics consist of platforming with the addition of being able to set gravity fields that either pull or push you away from them to avoid obstacles or solve platforming puzzles.As a BONUS, if you pick this game up while it's on sale (like I did for 14c), you can sell the cards you obtain from it and make a profit (whilst adding another game to your Steam library and having a bit of fun with it).

You control your guy (girl?) that has a swaggie gun thing that changes the gravity force of the place you shoot, while accompanied by a deep-space swag overload music and there is the challenging hard mode which I love-hate with all my heart.The graphics are not swag approved and there is also a lack of story.Overall it's fun and I would like a sequel, cause I got another 0.09€ to spend.

												As this game is only 9p with its' 90% off, I wasn't expecting much, but I totally underestimated this game. Comparing it to a 2D Portal would be a vague comparison, but they are pretty similar.In this game you have a gun which shoots a blue ray, a pulling force, and a orange ray, a repelling force. Using these forces you have to figure out puzzles and ways to get around obstacles (similar to Portal) and interact with the enemies around you. The style of the game reminds me of the retro side of games, but it kind of adds some sort of character to the game. Oh and also, it gets pretty hard I wanted to dieAll in all, I really think you should get this game. Not just because it is extremely cheap, but that it has so much to over and it really enjoyable. I am not near finishing it, but I definitively have my moneys worth (it did cost 9p for Christ's sake).			",35,5,0,2,10,1,2

												This game is actually a fairly enjoyable experience. The game mechanics consist of platforming with the addition of being able to set gravity fields that either pull or push you away from them to avoid obstacles or solve platforming puzzles.As a BONUS, if you pick this game up while it's on sale (like I did for 14c), you can sell the cards you obtain from it and make a profit (whilst adding another game to your Steam library and having a bit of fun with it).

												What the hell?! The game is now so much more expensive than it was before!This game is surprisingly good for its former price. Pros: the difficulty is just right: it get's more difficult as you advance, but not to the point that you want to throw your computer against the wall. Cheap. At least it was. It was so cheap that you would actually make money from it by selling its cards! Easy 100% achievements; the graphic sprites aren't great, but are ok;  sound effects and music are satisfying. is not repetitive.Cons: if you have high expectations, this game will be too simple for you; no controls rebinding; not worth its current price; poor interface; one short gameplay and nothing else to do. No extras.For its current prince (BRL 6.29, USD 2.99), I do not think it's worth, but I will say it for my experience with this game, not only actually playing the game, but also considering the price I paid — almost nothing (BRL 0.24, which is USD 0.07): it was worth the value, so I recommend this.

												So Defy Gravity, quite a nice platformer, and I'm very terrible at these -.-. But this has handy mechanic which puts you in control of two wells one is pulling you (and other objects) towards it, the other is pushing you away. This allows for some dodging and jump'n'run action. Additionally you have a shield to protect you from these effects. I liked:++ unique gameplay mechanic+ cheap price (0,09€ in Steam Sale), extremely good value for your money+ challenging but doable, either with try and error or a by planning ahead++ multiple solutions for puzzles+ relatively fast respawnI disliked:- not so good collision meshes- no visual difference, levels are all looking similar to each other, variety would improve the overall experience- story is missing :((((- strange point-and-shoot feature, which requires timing (only when you release the mouse button a gravity well is created)- controls are unchangeable (but there is controller support)At the time of writing this review I did not finish the game once, but I think I may need a total of about 4 hours with my bad skills...I would recommend this game, because of its new mechanic and it is a great game to spent some time.

												I found this game very dull, unfortunately. Was looking forward to playing it, then was just like ""this is just a boring platformer"". Poor attempt at a storyline, and gameplay is too frustrating to be enjoyable. There is also too much going on to be able to focus on tasks. Only managed to play about 10 minutes before giving up.

												This game is pure value for those that love puzzles and platformers.  It gives you just enough control to have fun with experimenting ways to solve each level which is a quite refreshing from the usual platformer.  I liked that death is not very punishing and coupled with a soothing soundtrack makes it very relaxing and enjoyable.			",279,40,5,26,14,3,34

												Got this on a whim when it was at 0.29$, definitely worth every penny! The difficulty of the game is slow at first but picks up half way through, which may catch some people by surprise depending on how they played. The mechanics worked just as they should, and while the enemy objects had a bit of a clunky hit box, they were not too hard to get around. Takes a few hours to play all the way through, but a good game at this price nonetheless! 8,5/10			",195,81,2,12,18,2,32

And it wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything new or great.What is this game? Well its a puzzle platformer. The grapics aren't great neither is the gameplay but it's worth the money (around 15 cents) at the sale. It was fun but was short and simplistic.

												Defy Gravity is a nice little puzzle game that can be fun but challengeing at the same time. With its little sound track of three songs as far as i can tell but they do go with the theme of the game. A comparison for this game and from all the games I have played and seen its a little like Portal but without haveing to go thought walls. instead you use the force of the gravity gun witch is what is game is mostly about. Only dissapointment though was that i didn't notice any consellations in the background of space maybe they where there maybe not.But anyway Defy Gravity is worth checking out for the 0.19 cents.

												Barely a puzzle game. Buggy, cheap looking and sounding with unreliable mechanics, bad unchangable controls, and heavy doses of monotony and unpuzzlelike randomness in later levels. Also barely a platformer since you spend most of your time helpless in the air hoping things don't kill you as you jump from buggy gravity well to buggy gravity well. Buy only if you want card profits.			",145,51,0,11,14,1,3

												Bought this game for 14 cents, you can sell achievemnts for more. 10/10 free money. However, it's also really quite a good puzzle platformer. Challenging, but not impossible. Portal like. I just clear a few maps between playing other games every few weeks. Really a gem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defy Gravity is a nice little puzzle game that can be fun but challengeing at the same time. With its little sound track of three songs as far as i can tell but they do go with the theme of the game. A comparison for this game and from all the games I have played and seen its a little like Portal but without haveing to go thought walls. instead you use the force of the gravity gun witch is what is game is mostly about. Only dissapointment though was that i didn't notice any consellations in the background of space maybe they where there maybe not.But anyway Defy Gravity is worth checking out for the 0.19 cents.

												The game sucks. It really does. The controls are mostly functional, but usually not when you actually need them to be. The game randomly switches to a completely black screen in the middle of play, so you can't continue until you manage to fix it. Once youactually figure out how to use the controlls correctly to slingshot yourself around, the game becomes incredibly easy. Oh, and then there's the whole fact that this game looks and plays like it was made in Game Maker.I got it for $0.99, though, and it pretty much paid itself off with the trading cards, so I'm really not complaining.

												Deviously difficult platformer, that somehow has a hard mode too. This game is frustrating at times, and at certain points sometimes unfair. Especially in hard mode the difficulty skyrockets in the last few levels due to a small amount of checkpoints, and an incredible small margin for errors.That said: If you like platformers, and don't mind trying the same part of a level over and over and over and over and over again until you nail it, this is the game for you.As a plus, this game has a pretty good soundtrack to keep you company while you see the message ""Press jump to try again."" for the 100th time.It took me almost 6 hours to complete normal mode and hard mode and thus get all achievements. Not bad for a $2 price tag, or even less during a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty cool game. As others have noted, if you get it at a good sale price (0.29 cents, for instance) it's very possible to make more selling the cards you get than you paid for the game. Beyond that, however, it's just a lot of fun... it can be frustrating at times, but it's still very fair. The achievements are easy, but not too easy. It's not very long, but it's still long enough to justify the price.Bottom line: even at full price, it's worth it. But if you can get it on sale (the aforementioned 0.29 cents, for example) it's a no-brainer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Controls are unresponsive and all most objects seems to have randomised hit-boxes. This will make you furious and tired of playing this game. I can appreciate a difficult game, but not an unfair one. Defy Gravity Extender have some cool ideas, but the controls and level design just ruins it. It tries to be Portal copycat with some other elements, but it never feels like anything else then a simple school project.The graphics are very simple, but okay. It looks like a web browser flash game almost. The music is, in my opinion, the best part about the game, however it can get repetitive after a while. Only pick this game up on sale if you want trading cards. You can sell the cards for the same price as this game, maybe even earn some cash. Based on gameplay and enjoyment I cannot however recommend this title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK, so I bought it with 95% off for 0.14$ only, which is practically free.And yes, I guess that even for the full price of 3$ it's okay, well it is an indie game.But you should know that this game is very buggy, and clearly not test-played well enough, as the levels are far from perfect. Third way through, 0.5 hrs on record, I'm already growing weary of it, as the levels are not as challenging as they are tedious.Now, the concept is good and with a better game design it actually might be a great game: for starters, we should not get all the powers at the first level, but attain them as the game advances. This way it won't be so easy, with so many ways to tackle each obstacle, and it won't have that premature feeling of exhaustion.The way the game is right now, I would recommend avoiding it; it is cheap, but probably doesn't worth your time. I have played many, many indie games over the years and none of them was sold half-baked as this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Considering its price tag, Defy Gravity could have been a decent puzzle platformer that lets the player shoot blue and orange points of gravitational pull and repulsion to navigate through the world, a la Portal, if it wasn't for the unappealing graphics and a game breaking lack of screen resolution support. Since the game uses the default desktop resolution, with no way to change it in-game, or even to switch to windowed mode, if a particular resolution is not supported, you would only be able to see a small part of the screen. The developer tried to remedy this by providing batch files that run the game windowed, but I was not able to use them because they refused to see that Steam is running and would just tell me to start Steam first... There is no reason why these settings could not be built into the game menu, and the way it stands now, Defy Gravity is unplayable for those with resolutions over 1080p.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I regret getting this game. It doesnt matter that i got it on sale. This game just doesn't appeal to me. It's just too hard for me and some levels are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard that i start raging a lot. At least they could do some kind of help tool if you get stuck and you can't proceed to the next bloody hard level. I had some good hopes for this game but I guess I was wrong. I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy it it just doesnt seem to be in my likings. I don't recommend this game for people who rage a lot because it will ruin their life sorta. Rated 6/10!

												""buy da game wen it on sale den sel da cards for more!1!!"" - Every review for this game, ever.This game is actually not that bad on the early stages, it introduces you to all the aspects and all most the enemies, now that wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that the stages in the later game get really bloody boring, and tedious. To the point where the puzzles aren't fun, just a grind. If you're going to get this game, get it on sale, don't get it for the full price, it's not an awful game, but I still can't recommend it to anyone to actually play. So, as every other review states;1. Buy the game when it's on sale2. Idle for the cards3. Sell the cards on market4. Profit.			",366,113,4,36,40,2,37

												The game feels fine. It's a solid puzzle game. It does the whole ""I'm trying to be portal"" thing in the first act, and there are a few gripping, quick-paced moments, but it's all ruined by the ATROCIOUS art style. The fun part of an indie game is the simplicity, sure, but when the art style is this neglected, it all feels very sloppy. They even describe the character, when obviously all you need for this game is ""You are a dude in a space suit. Have fun."" Sure, I got what I paid for at a staggering 0.23 or so USD on sale, but that isn't saying a lot. Hell, the font the WHOLE GAME uses is the default one from MS Word.All in all, unless you just want to waste .30 cents, don't get this game. Play a flash puzzle game instead, those are fun and usually free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a very good physics-based indie platformer game. Great for wannabe astrophysicists and space lovers. In this game, you've to work your way through the Gauntlet (a space competition) as a female space ninja, Kara, who can bend the laws of physics using Grav-wells and Anti-wells. If you're creative and played games like Angry Birds Space and liked them, you'll like it too! It develops your problem solving and lateral thinking skills because certain levels in the game are quite challenging. The soundtracks are also great and help you to focus on the gameplay. But the game is very short. Newbies may find the latter levels quite hard (some may even have to retry up to 10 times). It's recommended to buy this game on a sale because you can make a profit by selling the card drops as the price drops to $0.14 only!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game CAN be fun, but there are a lot of bugs and room for improvement. Like with the ammo system, there is nothing saying how much you have so you could be one shot away from survival but you would fire and nothing would happen, causing your imminate demise.Do NOT get unless your prepared to break something.

PROS:+ interesting concept+ checkpoint system in the earlier parts of the game+ Steam trading cards CONS:- gimmicky puzzles with enemy objects- bad hitboxes for both your character and enemy objects- Hard mode is just plain annoying without anti-gravity wellsComment:I read some reviews about how this game is challenging and you feel rewarded when you finish it. But after doing normal mode AND the hard mode ... well, I cannot agree. The first half of the levels are great, they are focused of puzzles on how to move forward through the level. The second half is really gimmicky, focused on avoiding enemy objects which actually have square hitboxes even though they are not square. Same goes for your character - Kara. There is no story so puzzles are the only thing interesting here and they begin to be very annoying as you progress. This is even more so in the Hard mode where you do not have anti-gravity wells. Through this the game becomes just gimmicky and not really fun. Also ""easy to 100%"" is not that easy as you have to beat Hard mode and that is a pure test of will and luck. The reason why I recommend this in the end is mainly for the trading cards...P.S.: I played this game without music because I had to put '-nomusic' in the launcher, otherwise the game crashed. Apparently this is due to Windows Media Player being required which I do not have...			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

At least acknowledge and respect the fact that the devs put in work to make the game. The least you could do is to play it.3. Post an actual review on whether this game is good or bad you like♥♥♥♥♥s. In which case:This game was surprisingly good,not exactly difficult but it's still enjoyable. What I like is the fact that you are not binded by a single means to clear a stage, but by your understanding of the game mechanics. Which open up to a lot of possibility.4.

												If you want to buy this game, wait for it to go on sale for $0.14, like when I bought it. This way you can make profit off of a video game! If you like the portal games and 2D platformers, this is the game for you! With wielding a gun that shoots a suspended ball that either pulls or pushes on your character, and with many obstacles to avoid and navigate, It makes for an amazing puzzle game. And its cheap too! With only a $2.99 base value and when on sale, super cheap, anybody can experience such an awesome game for little money. It also has a very intense difficulty curve that when you get that 3rd or 4th achievement, you'll notice that the game isn't as easy as it was before. It doesn't even take that long to get to that point either. So if you want a puzzle 2d platformer that's not very advanced and takes skill to play and learn, then go ahead and get this game because honestly, it was the best $0.14 I've ever spent! It even comes with trading cards (how I earned profit)!			",68,7,1,7,8,1,2

												If you want to buy this game, wait for it to go on sale for $0.14, like when I bought it. This way you can make profit off of a video game! If you like the portal games and 2D platformers, this is the game for you! With wielding a gun that shoots a suspended ball that either pulls or pushes on your character, and with many obstacles to avoid and navigate, It makes for an amazing puzzle game. And its cheap too! With only a $2.99 base value and when on sale, super cheap, anybody can experience such an awesome game for little money. It also has a very intense difficulty curve that when you get that 3rd or 4th achievement, you'll notice that the game isn't as easy as it was before. It doesn't even take that long to get to that point either. So if you want a puzzle 2d platformer that's not very advanced and takes skill to play and learn, then go ahead and get this game because honestly, it was the best $0.14 I've ever spent! It even comes with trading cards (how I earned profit)!			",68,7,1,7,8,1,2

												Defy Gravity is a very interesting game. You play as some astronaut guy and you traverse levels using a ""gravity gun."" This gravity gun can create portals that attract you toward them and portals that force you away from them. The gameplay mechanics and level design of this game are actually impressive! The game starts pretty easy but near the end some levels are litterally the deepest pits of hell. The ""hard mode"" of the game, which is unlocked after completing the normal mode, is actually much easier because you don't have to deal with the anti-gravity portals. Anyway, Defy Gravity is pretty fun, and on sale it's definitely worth it! (I got it for 29 cents.)Gameplay: 10/10 (Very fun game!)Dificulty:10/10 (There were a couple levels that actually disemboweled me...)Replay value: 8/10 (I can definitely see myself playing it again! And dying many more times...)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Would be interesting to see it in 3D, like Portal, this is more like Portal Flash, but beter in my opinion, if this game gets a good 3D version, Portal may have a good competition, even a rival, like LoL X Dota, BF X CoD etc...If the developers plan to do that in 3D i hope they take their time and not rush it, but all in all, this game rocks :)			",123,8,3,9,9,0,6

												Absolutely amazing game. Worth the price. It has the style of portal, without portals. You have a gravity gun (how many volvos am I going to refrence today?) that shoots gravity wells. They will suck you in or push you out- a black hole concept, while trying to get through the Gauntlet. You go through a series of waves of enemies, and if you truly want to put your skills to the test, at the end, there is a hardmode.Pro 1 ABSOLUTELY AMAZING soundtrack. It fits perfectly.Pro 2 Unique game mechanics. I have never seen them before.Pro 3 Nice and cheap, especially when you have a coupon that makes it 74 cents :PCon 1... hmm... hard to think... Short? Sure, why not? I'm sure they'll update it though.8.9/10. Would spend the extra 3 dollars to play it.			",37,4,0,3,4,0,1

												If this game is on sale, it's probably stupidly cheap and well worth at least the trading cards you get from it. It's a fairly short 2-3 hour full game if you're already good at platformers in general and getting a feel for game mechanics, but the music change-ups can keep you around if you're halfway in and might start to get bored. The music gives you a feeling of purpose, with a trippy dreamscape allure, or some such shaite( I dunno man, I'm no critique). I love that the music corresponds to certain level themes, it's what really distinguishes this from some flash game on Kongregate. That, and the good amount of difficulty later on and in the ""Extended"" portion(basically just hard mode).Overall, keep it on your wishlist and wait for it to cost like thirty cents at the most, it runs very smooth for what it is, so no glitches just dreamy atmosphere, simple game mechanics, and yada yada good things to say about this game.

												Absolutely amazing game. Worth the price. It has the style of portal, without portals. You have a gravity gun (how many volvos am I going to refrence today?) that shoots gravity wells. They will suck you in or push you out- a black hole concept, while trying to get through the Gauntlet. You go through a series of waves of enemies, and if you truly want to put your skills to the test, at the end, there is a hardmode.Pro 1 ABSOLUTELY AMAZING soundtrack. It fits perfectly.Pro 2 Unique game mechanics. I have never seen them before.Pro 3 Nice and cheap, especially when you have a coupon that makes it 74 cents :PCon 1... hmm... hard to think... Short? Sure, why not? I'm sure they'll update it though.8.9/10. Would spend the extra 3 dollars to play it.			",37,4,0,3,4,0,1

												Defy Gravity is a very interesting game. You play as some astronaut guy and you traverse levels using a ""gravity gun."" This gravity gun can create portals that attract you toward them and portals that force you away from them. The gameplay mechanics and level design of this game are actually impressive! The game starts pretty easy but near the end some levels are litterally the deepest pits of hell. The ""hard mode"" of the game, which is unlocked after completing the normal mode, is actually much easier because you don't have to deal with the anti-gravity portals. Anyway, Defy Gravity is pretty fun, and on sale it's definitely worth it! (I got it for 29 cents.)Gameplay: 10/10 (Very fun game!)Dificulty:10/10 (There were a couple levels that actually disemboweled me...)Replay value: 8/10 (I can definitely see myself playing it again! And dying many more times...)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defy Gravity is a pretty challenging and fun platformer if you can ignore the bad graphics and the overall presentation.You play as what seems to be an astronaut with some sort of a gravity gun that can create gravity anomalies that help you advance through various levels, some of which will require a lot of thinking and planning to complete.The game itself is fun and there's definitely lots of hours of gameplay here, so really the only downside to all of this is that it looks a bit amateurish due to poor graphics and mediocre sound. But don't let that stop you. It's actually pretty awesome.			",329,77,2,41,53,2,38

												It's a simple yet beautiful puzzle game that actualy stumped me a few times. It's hard mode is also very impressive, as instead of a standard more enemy HP/time limit/etc, now you can't use anti-gravity wells which forces you to go all ninja everywhere on the map. All the enemies are also now effected by regular gravity wells, so you shouldn't stay in a particular well for very long.Amazingly well thought-out game. Definately buy this.			",133,26,3,8,36,0,35

It's hard mode is also very impressive, as instead of a standard more enemy HP/time limit/etc, now you can't use anti-gravity wells which forces you to go all ninja everywhere on the map. All the enemies are also now effected by regular gravity wells, so you shouldn't stay in a particular well for very long.Amazingly well thought-out game. Definately buy this.			",133,26,3,8,36,0,35

												I bought this when it was worth a quarter, 33/25 made profit by selling the cardsAs for the game, it's surprising good for how cheap it is. Beating the levels is kind of like solving a puzzle, but you still need mechanical skill.			",109,7,0,4,2,1,4

												I can't say that I've finished the game... Yet. I'm about two-thirds or three-quarters of the way through, so I'm fairly close to finishing it.This game, whether you're reading this review during a sale or during regular prices, the game is worth the $3 or $0.29. Now trust me, I looked at the pictures and I wasn't thinking it was gonna be that great since the level design didn't look that good. But I can confirm that it's pretty amazing.I want to point out that in the description it says ""Unique physics engine that provides a never before experienced gameplay experience"", they're not joking. I haven't really had a puzzle/platformer games have me use both gravity (pull) and anti-gravity (push) fields to complete a level.As of the difficulty of the game, I wouldn't say it's Super Meat Boy level, but it's definitely not any Superfrog HD.But don't forget the music. It may be only two or three tracks, but they're pretty good for a little indie game of this size (Roughly 50 MB).All the music and tiny little bugs and such included, I give this a solid 7/10.EDIT: I've completely finished the game now. I do think that this could have a solid sequel with more levels and I actually look forward to one. I still stick with my 7/10 :)			",214,25,9,12,11,6,20

												Defy Gravity is a pretty challenging and fun platformer if you can ignore the bad graphics and the overall presentation.You play as what seems to be an astronaut with some sort of a gravity gun that can create gravity anomalies that help you advance through various levels, some of which will require a lot of thinking and planning to complete.The game itself is fun and there's definitely lots of hours of gameplay here, so really the only downside to all of this is that it looks a bit amateurish due to poor graphics and mediocre sound. But don't let that stop you. It's actually pretty awesome.			",329,77,2,41,53,2,38

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",156,33,6,11,17,4,24

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a platform kind of game.Interface/Menu/SettingsNone.About the game.You are playing with a dude in a white suit in space. He has a gravity gun which will help him across obstacles and other situations. He will get sucked into the gravity ball and goes to the centre of the gravity ball. He also has an anti-well gun where  he will get repelled from. He will get pushed away from the center to reach higher area's. You can also use the gravity shield to protect you from the guns effect.There is an in-game tutorial.Graphics are dull and simple.You are able to use a xbox controller if turned on.You see a small controller manual when pressing esc.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			",467,171,6,45,49,1,62

												I adore this game.This game has controlled and stable mechanics, and it's so challenging yet so fun!I've played this game for at least an hour or two. It's so engaging the way you can just sometimes speedrun around levels!The art style is good. The gameplay is good. The Steam Trading Cards gave me a foil!9/10 would recommend.			",56,7,1,3,11,1,1

												I actually liked the game. Controls are good, music is okay and graphics are not the best but for the 20-30 cents you bought it what would you expect. This game looks like a school project that made it to steam. The idea is not bad, but i think they didn't fully realized its potential. I think they should have added more elements, a story and maybe even a final boss. On the picture of the game we see a girl with purple hair. I expected she would remove her helmet and reveal that she was a girl after the a final boss like in Metroid.Overall it's a good game for the money you're giving. I would give it a 7/10.

												Story: ~5/10 The story is very, very simple. I don't think the developers intended to elaborate on this part. The gameplay is more important. Story not needed.Controls: 9/10 Really fluid. However, to place a gravity well, you click and hold, and a well will be thrown in the direction you clicked. To make the well stop moving, you release the click. This gets rather annoying. as it would be better if the well stopped exactly where you clicked.Graphics: 3/10 Horrid. However, the space backgrounds and gravity wells are okay.Music: 8/10 Creates a nice atmosphere.Difficulty Balancing: 8/10 Good balancing between too easy/too hard.Needed Features:-Slightly better control sceme-Level mapOverall: 8/10 Good for 14 cents			",337,98,8,31,23,3,29

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Defy Gravity Extended 

			Views: 7		

			A very humble game, Defy Gravity's clever mechanics and puzzle design are hidden behind weak visuals and presentation. If you can look past a weak first impression the game will quickly grow on you.		

A very humble game, Defy Gravity's clever mechanics and puzzle design are hidden behind weak visuals and presentation.  If you can look past a weak first impression the game will quickly grow on you.Armed with a weapon that creates gravity wells that will retract or repulse you, unless your grave shield is on and a simple jet pack for extra jumping height.  Use these tools to solve increasingly complex platform based puzzles.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

												This game is plain ugly, visually inconsistent and I could swear it's using stock images and ripped assets (Twenty bucks the completion sound is same as Warcraft 3's ping sound!). This is like one of those ugly Greenlight games that should never pass, and don't ask me how it ended up on Steam on the first place, being rather simple and unsighty.Still, there is one excuse for it: Next time it will cost like 30 cents, buy it and you'll get yourself like 45 cents worth of cards!  Economics, aren't they awesome?			",156,30,1,24,19,1,44

												Hmm, not that bad of an Indie game, but not for everyone, definitely    not 'casual' or friendly.Pro- music is nice- interesting gravity controllsCon- art style is generic- platforms twitch around gravity and drops you off- lazers everywhere like spikes in VVVVVV- after like half of the game becomes very hard or just need to be lucky :D4/10 rating.

												Revision: After playing a little more with this game all I can say is: The Physics in this game are way to unpredictable to be fun. The only reason to get this game is to make money by selling the trading cards when it is on discount. Other than that: Avoid it at any cost.Original Review:Ok, I got this game in the same sale as assumely most people here atm.The game idea itself isn't so bad. You are an astronut :) holding some sort of space-gun. With this gun you can shoot two different types of missile-like projectiles that aim the direction you're pointing the cursor at and explode as soon as you let go the mousebutton.One of the projectiles creates an orb that sucks you in and the other one creates one that pushes you away. You have a doublejump too but you won't get very far in this game unless you master the correctly timed placement of those two orb-type-thingies to drive your player around the different courses.The difficulty curve starts fair and easy and there even is a tutorial at the beginning of the game explaining all the different things you can do. But really it isn't much more as I mentioned before. There are some types of ""enemies"" though. Some cannot be touched but jumped on and another sort cannot be touched at all. If you do so nonetheless you'll get killed instantly.Sounds interesting eh?Well it is (as long as you can cope with the plain graphics and leveldesign). But there is one major flaw that renders this game nearly impossible to play at higher levels: The physics everything is based on really aren't that perfectly done. I died plenty of times because the player sprite fell through a correctly placed push-orb or didn't get sucked to a suck-orb.And yes this sucks (even without any orb) and so pushes one away from the game way too soon ... Without these flaws it could easily be a nice game because, as I said in the beginning of this review, the core game idea is good. But due to the fact of the imperfect physics I think that most players won't get very far ...But what the heck. All in all you get this game for free because you can always trade in the trading cards and maybe even make a few bucks plus this way. So maybe I'm just a sucker at this game and you will have great fun with it.For the price they're asking right now you should give this game a try if you're into platforming action-puzzlers. At least you can't loose anything in the process ...			",276,66,8,23,21,3,37

												Ugh, this game is alright, I suppose. Definitely not the worst game I've ever played.The controls are horrible, for a start. I kept messing up because instinct told me to hold W, even though that is jump and holding jump is liable to get you killed, because space is also jump, and you can't jump if you're holding both jump buttons.Graphics are Flash-era. The game is too, sort of.The puzzles are... Some of them are easy, some of them are hard, and some of them are just deathtraps to annoy you. Mostly deathtraps. Checkpoints are placed before/after every puzzle, which is nice.However, working with gravity and anti-gravity, well... it's a fun concept, and it was fun at times in this game as well, but due to the fact that most 'puzzles' are just deathtraps with tons of hazards, it's not really that fun.The music is alright, though.Oh yeah, and don't try playing this game with a controller. You need the high sensitivity of a mouse to even attempt half these puzzles.And the dev is fishy, too. Bumping back the release date just so it always appears in Upcoming Titles. Considering the publisher's name, I shouldn't be surprised.(get it? fish factory, fishy dev? ah, forget it) ",87,6,0,4,4,1,6

												The game mechanic is interesting, but that's pretty much it. The game wasn't polished enough to keep up my interest after attempting the same stretch of level ten times over before being able to reach the next part. I'm usually more pationt than that, but not with this game. Get it on sale just to experience the innovative mechanics, but be prepared to put it away after a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's hard to reccomend this game at full price, but I guess it's okay if you snag it in a sale.The game consists of platforming and using a gun that can create gravity wells that either pull you in or repel you. You can probably beat the entire game in under an hour then replay it again on hard mode to get the final achievement in one more hour.Some of the puzzzles are legitimately difficult which was fun. Hard mode was great. This game is just so very short.			",77,21,1,10,2,0,14

												This game is way to simple to be fun. It feels like a flash game anybody could have created if they looked up coding for a gravity that effects a character and objects. It doesn't even have a jump animation. The only ""good"" thing about this game is the fact that you can get cards worth more than the game itself is when on sale. I'm sorry to whoever developed this for the harsh review, but you really need to polish this. It feels more unfinished than some of the games that are currently in Alpha stages.			",83,10,0,11,8,0,7

												This is what I call a very good game. I found that the later levels are a bit on the hard side but it is still fun. The story is basic but good, the gameplay is rather basic but good as well. GAMEPLAYIt's pretty much like Super Mario with a slight twist.You have a gun that creates gravity wells and anti-gravity wells.The gun helps you through the levels.There are also different ways you can get through the maps as well.MUSICI think the music really matches the game, I give it a 4/5.GRAPHICSThe graphics are basic, nothing earth shareting but still looks good.OverallThis is a great game for it's price.It has very good gameplay, music and graphics.I recomand this game to anyone who wants to buy a cheap game on steam.

												This is the perfect game for people who like everything and are easily impressed. There is some fun and satisfaction to be had solving these puzzles but other people will find them annoying and tedious. And the levels are unpolished. The world of Defy Gravity is not a vibrant world alive with colors and life or amazing artwork. Its a pretty drab place that made me want to kill myself the way it constantly reminded me I was wasting my life playing it.I don't remember the music. I didn't like the controls. I did like the way they didn't keep sending me all the way back to the beginning. If they'd done that I would have actually been mad so I thank them for that consideration. The price was right but I fear that someday soon I'll have a need for that 29 cents. I hope they use the money to buy some talent and good ideas. They are sorely needed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a rather nice puzzle game for a low price, except for one annoying bug. At the start of every level, the screen will be black until you shoot a gravity well. The screen will also become black randomly in the middle of a level if you haven't got any gravity wells out, which can be quite annoying if you're in the middle of a death-defying jump.Needless to say that I can't quite enjoy this game as I should. Until this bug has been fixed (which I understood the dev has been trying to figure out for over a half year now), I can't possibly recommend this game as it's more annoying than enjoyable.To show an example why this is rather annoying... in one of those levels there is a laser beam heading your way, and you have to get to the other end of the level as fast as possible. There are a rather lot of spikes on the floor and you have to jump with a floating platform and time things nicely. Now, imagine jumping with a hot laser beam on your tail and you need to be able to look where you are jumping off to, and suddenly the lights go out for no reason. Very likely you're going to die, and the screen stays black even when you start over. The hot laser beam, however, is still heading towards you in the restarted level and you won't see it until you shoot some random gravity well just to notice you're too late and died again. Rinse and repeat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disregarding one of the worst bugs I've ever encountered in any game (black screen whenever the game loads or reloads until the gravity gun is fired even though the game is actively going), this game is really bad. It has some interesting ideas, and it's certainly not the worst game I've ever played. However, most student games I've encountered are better than this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is impressively bad. There's a crashing-bug on the first screen unless you use command-line options to force it into windowed mode and disable the music. Once that's sorted out you find yourself in the midst of the kind of ""I made this in just 30 minutes"" shovelware that you'd expect to see with a low score on a flash games site. (NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION.) The controls are poor, the concept is moderately amusing, but very poorly executed. There's no storyline of any sort beyond the opening screen. The graphics are garbage.I felt like I should exercise some restraint in making harsh criticism, since this smacked of ""baby's first vidya gurm"", but then I got the trading card with the girl showing her cleavage, which I figured would be worth 5 seconds of amusement. Then I clicked on it to see the full-sized version and instead of showing the picture on the card it showed a gameplay screenshot.This is a troll game. Don't waste your time.This game goes on sale sometimes for $0.29 USD. The cards are currently worth about $0.08 USD, and you get 3 of them, so you can get this game for a nickel. It's worth about a dime less than that, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would not recomend this game to anyone. My first reason being that the controls are absolutly terrible. My second problem with this game being the skill gap jump from the first 2-3 levels to the 3-END levels, It seems like it holds your hand till the end of the ""Prolouge""  and then drops you off into a levels that you may or may not be able to pass. Overall my experience was very bad, and I did not enjoy the game one bit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												...too easy. Seriously.----------1) Bad graphics. Really bad effects. The object are everything but nice, the background is probably a random image from Google, and the walls...did you just copy the walls from another game, and took out the particles?2) Bad music. I never saw epic music...also bad, epic music...mixed with sime xx-bit sounds, probably MIDI if not xx-bit, and on a ""space"" game too.3) Easy to understand how it works...easier to understand how levels should be made. The hard part? The mouse cursor is useless. You have to wait for the right amount of time, and the job is done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defy Gravity is an action platformer that is a mix between classic platforming and gravity based puzzle solving. Kara, our heroine, has access to a unique gameplay mechanic that she uses to manipulate the world around her. She has a gun that is able to alter the laws of physics through the creation of pockets of gravity and anti-gravity. By mastering the use of these abilities Kara is able to augment her jump in order to almost fly past obstacles. These powers can also be utilized to move objects that block her path and platforms that Kara stands on in order to traverse the levels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Right so after just half an hour, stuck. Blazed through tutorial, came across one puzzle and...its impossible. Literally impossible. And you aren't offered a tip or even a skip, nope. Apart from that, very boring graphically, cool concept but literally a reskinned 2D portal with a slightly different mechanic. If its on special sure try it out.			",46,14,1,0,14,0,1

												I suggust everyone buying this game right now for two reasons.1. The game is 30cents, and you get trading ards that are worth more than 30cents = profit2. The game itself is incredibly fun and unique to play3. What it comes down to is that you get paid to play a great game... why are you stil reading this?

												It's good for your basic side scroller. Please keep in mind I got this at while it was $0.29. The controls are decent for the keyboard but it feels out of place sometimes imo. There is no settings/adjusting in game and basically you just have to deal with it. Also the levels are come off quite repetitive and it seems like it's the same thing over and over again but in the end I did enjoy it for the price it was and I was expecting a lot worse.

												I'm actually surprised that I enjoyed this game as much as I did. I got the game for 29 cents and sold the cards for more than that, so I actually got paid to play the game. I liked the unique gameplay of using gravity manipulation to get from one platform to another, there was a steep difficulty curve in the middle of the game but it wasn't too bad. The music was also good, though I'm not sure if it was made for this game. If you got rid of the cheap animations, tweaked the controls and gameplay a bit and added a bit of depth and a story, you could have a pretty decent game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're thinking about picking this up during the sales at $0.29 DON'T!It feels like an unfinished unpolished piece of work. The mechanics are there but it just doesn't seem to work so well. Gravity doesn't seem to pull you enough at times and likewise for Repel. Jetpack doesn't ""refuel"" itself well enough (maybe have a jetpack bar indicator? that little light on the pack isn't good enough.The aiming animation of the character is locked to up, middle and down. Its hard to tell where you're aiming despite the character still shooting in the same direction as your mouse. C'mon guys, if you're making a mouse controlled game at least make it smoother.Don't even get me started about the UI. The UI is absolutely horrible. Theres no design in the UI to make it at least aesthetically appealing. Art of the game is just average.It seems like this game was made by a bunch of students for a student project. Which would be fine, I always encourage and look forward to indie works, but PLEASE PLEASE polish it before you release it on Steam!! How did this game even got on Steam is beyond me. I'm sorry devs, your game isn't even worth the $0.29. Heck your game isn't even worth me selling the cards and getting back $0.07.If you're looking for a game like this you'll have better luck on Kongregate.Rating: 1/10 for Kara			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was much better than I expected it to be. I got it as a gift, but with the sale right now it is easily worth it. The game practically pays you to play it since the cards seell for more than the game so there is no risk of losing money on a bad game. When I first started playing this game, I didn't think I would  enjoy it since it look basically like a cheap flash game. Though as I continued playing, I started to enjoy it. Defy Gravity is a fun and easy to play game, but it still has a level of difficulty that makes it playable. The controls are simple and easy to use and easy to get down quickly. The soundtrack is also very good. Its nice and soothing and it doesn't distract you while playing. Overall, a fun game that would be a nice addition to your collection, and even if you're not that into it, it will still provide enough entertainment to kill boredom.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought it because it was super cheap and I could get trading cards. It reminded me of the flash version of Portal except you attract and repel yourself with gravity.Although you get many invisible checkpoints and enter lots of doors, I had no idea how many levels or how far I went in the game. I thought I was pretty close to beating it and then I got a screen telling me that the game was going to start getting harder. Didn't make it much past that part.Good sidescrolling puzzle platformer, bad graphics, decent music, wouldn't pay more than $.14			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well i got it for and he bought it for 0.09€ And all i can really say about it that it really is worth its price, well atleast in this case. The game is a relaxing puzzle platformer like the Portal games, but this is set in a 2D environment.Even tho the game is short it did have some replayability value in it, i have to admit i had fun going through the game and it did get harder as levels went on.If you have an sale opportunity to buy this game, do it.**7/10**			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I keep forgetting which is to close orange and which is to close blue. Also, aiming and moving at the same time, are the most difficult things of the game. 80% of the time I died cause I just couldn't move and aim.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was much better than I expected it to be. I got it as a gift, but with the sale right now it is easily worth it. The game practically pays you to play it since the cards seell for more than the game so there is no risk of losing money on a bad game. When I first started playing this game, I didn't think I would  enjoy it since it look basically like a cheap flash game. Though as I continued playing, I started to enjoy it. Defy Gravity is a fun and easy to play game, but it still has a level of difficulty that makes it playable. The controls are simple and easy to use and easy to get down quickly. The soundtrack is also very good. Its nice and soothing and it doesn't distract you while playing. Overall, a fun game that would be a nice addition to your collection, and even if you're not that into it, it will still provide enough entertainment to kill boredom.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's good for your basic side scroller. Please keep in mind I got this at while it was $0.29. The controls are decent for the keyboard but it feels out of place sometimes imo. There is no settings/adjusting in game and basically you just have to deal with it. Also the levels are come off quite repetitive and it seems like it's the same thing over and over again but in the end I did enjoy it for the price it was and I was expecting a lot worse.

												bought the game and another one for what cents were left on my paysafecard its nice and funny you have 2 diffrent types of gravity you can control for each level you must reach the door to go on. With the yellow gravity you can also make rocket jumps but beware when your shield is stuck gravity works not anymore like you think.  For only 19 cents and you get up to 3 trading cards its near no cost and you cant make much wrong with it.Recommend this little funny game for those who have some cents in their pocket and dont know what to do with it well in my case it was like that.

												Indie platforming at its best (And most hardcore), filled with very solid gravity-manipulating game mechanics, awesome tests of skill and alternate solutions to the jumping puzzles. It gets REALLY hard REALLY quickly, which is either a warning or a selling point depending on what you're looking for. It is just SO satisfying to nail the landing that gets you past whatever the latest obstacle was.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game gets extremely repetitive after time, as levels that involve jumping on orbs and moving platforms are used over and over as if they had run out of ideas. I'm going to list the pros and cons of this game:PROS--Very nice music-Good ideas for the main part of the game (creating gravity)-Something different than pixels/voxalsCONS--Bad art style (reminds me of gamemaker or scratch...)-repetitive levels-extreme difficulty (the game becomes tedious, not hard, just tedious)-Almost no options or settings-annoying and repetitive soundsNow if I haven't said repetitive enough, just wait 'til you hear what comes after you beat the game. In terraria, one of my favourite games, hard mode is introduced after a while and new enemies appear, new ore, new enviroments and a lot of stuff for you to gear up against the horde of increasingly difficult enemies. That game is hard. Now, in this game, 'hard mode' just means the whole game is repeated, except your most useful tool, the anti-grav well, is no longer available. Also, all enemies now follow your grav wells. This game is tedious.I feel sorry if you are a completionist, because what this means is that you have to go through the whole game twice, in which the game normally is hard enough, this time you have no way of avoiding enemies as grav wells are your only means of movement, but all enemies follow this.Enemies, by the way, just means the sprites half your size of ninja stars and bouncing balls that come in straight lines and 1 hit you, with no way of you being able to destroy them or attack them (unless they are yellow, in that case they follow your grav wells, which is pretty pointless if you need to USE THEM YOURSELF?!).tl;dr: not even worth £1 this game. I actually got a profit of 2p from this game because of a sale and trading cards but if i bought it now, not worth a penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game in pretty far and it's a fun simple platformer with a puzzle element to it. At first you start off with the basics, but then it quickly starts turning more into a rage game as the levels can get quite difficult. It's definitely a good game for those who like a challenge and like figuring out the timing to challenging side-scrollers. Included here is a link to my gameplay of the first few levels for anyone interested:

												Just got the game on sale for $0.16 and i have to say its a pretty solid simple game. The idea is using gravity and antigravity to move through puzzles. The interesting Dynamic this creates is very fun and enjoyable! Would buy again.			",49,13,2,13,10,0,13

												Oh well.""Defy the gravity!""They said.""It will be fun!""They said.Defy Gravity was one of the only games that actually made me quite mad. And I did not expect it. I wont make a long review for it, since it is very short and simple game.Defy Gravity is a little 2D platformer, where the player can make gravity, and anti-gravity wells, and progress through levels thanks to this. You will hear a nice calm chill music in the background, but you might notice that you dont give a single damn about it when you are trying to beat the game. The controls are simple, the game is catchy, but there is A LOT levels that are complete brainfart and require just alot of luck. Mostly the last few levels. But it is worth to play. I got it for 9 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cents on a sale, and I definitely cannot regret it. It is just one average game, but for the price, like please, just buy it on a sale.PROS:+ Simple+ Catchy+ CheapCONS:- Brainfart levels- Short (atleast it did not get boring though)- Last achievement is cancer to get. (Might be a Pro for people looking for a challenge, but I definitelly didnt enjoy it personally.)Anyways, hope you already bought the game, and good luck defying the gravity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But ther sensation you get when you finally clear that level that was giving you a hard time, you just can't find that nowadays. Oh, and it pays for itself with cards. What more could you ask?

												Defy Gravity is a pretty great game. The music suits the atmosphere very well, being calm and collected to match the smooth pace of the game. Dying presents no annoyance, letting you get right back into the action of the game. The controls, whilst they could be improved upon quite easily, serve their purpose. There are a few glaring annoyances such as the somewhat shoddy hitboxing and the tendency for the game to register your single jump as a double jump, costing you a death quite easily. All in all though, the puzzles are generally very well made and serve to test the players skill in timing, strategy, and a variety of other necessary areas. Honestly, I would give this game a nice solid little 7.5 out of ten. I picked this game up for 18 pence, and it's definitely worth more than that. Pick it up whenever possible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An awesome game. Impulsively bought it while it was on special expecting not much.... what a surprise!An interesting mechanic with an adequate learning curve / set of level design.I thought the difficulty was just right. A good challenge but that is never discouraging. You know you'll make it eventually without pulling too many hair out… just a little… just enough.Same for the 2nd walkthrough with only one gravity hole. I'd progressively adapt and have just as much fun in the 2nd play through.Also, the music was surprisingly fitting and very enjoyable.I personally bought this while it was on special, but I wouldn’t of been too upset to have paid the full price. Three dollars for about 3 hours of original gameplay seems fair to me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has surprisingly more going for it than it's Newgrounds appearance may lead you to believe, with some well designed and tricky puzzles inside its disappointingly short playtime.Gameplay wise this is a pretty simple, but good idea seemingly inspired by Portal, except rather than firing portals connecting to each other, you fire a blue gravity well, which pulls you towards it, and an orange anti-gravity well which pushes you away. Despite the simple controls being basically move, aim, fire, and remove gravity wells, I found this game to play much better when using a controller, so bear that in mind while considering playing it.Graphics are nothing more than what would be expected of an in-browser flash game, the space-y backgrounds look nice, but the main character is poorly animated and enemies and other platforms are very simple in design. Despite this the music in the game was pretty nice, nothing too special but it fit well and never seemed intrusive.I managed to get this game really cheap (9p) in a sale, and while I wouldn't say it's worth full price, it would definitely be worth more than that, although from selling cards I managed to make a (very small) profit, so if that's your goal then go for it. Also if achievements are your thing then it's possible to get all eight of them (which are based solely on story progression) in just three hours, and I didn't need to resort to any sort of guides, despite being stuck in places for a while.Overall this game is good, cheap fun for a slow afternoon, but don't expect a life-changing experience.8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game is taking the idea of Valves ""Portal"" to a whole new level. Normally, I don't even care about games like these (Jump&Run, flashgame-feeling etc.) but seeing it almost for free made me think ""why the hell not?"". Sure, the gameplay maybe could use some tweaks, but it's a very nice game for playing occasionally. Wouldn't have paid the full price though due to the aforementioned reasons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defy Gravity is a small platformer game that's perfect for people who have low-end graphics or processing. For people who switch between controller and keyboard/mouse, I found this game to work better with keyboard and mouse (although you have the option of controller if preferred),The premise is built around a similar concept of many portal-style games; the key difference here is that the portals are not a shortcut in the map, but have a 'push' or 'pull' mechanic depending on the color. The levels were fairly easy once you got a hang for the controls, and features a hard mode after completing the game.Players who have played platformers in the past without issue won't have an issue here.  Gameplay doesn't change too much during the levels, and the achievements are fairly straight-forward.I don't know if the game is worth the full price, but sales will put the game at a very reasonable cost. I would recommend this game for the experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hard mode doesn't have harder puzzles, but instead ties your hand behind your back and says 'Do it again!'...now I refer you to my first sentence!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gravity wells are extremely inconsistant, making it very difficult to make a judgement call between jumps, positive gravity wells are extremely weak and get ignored when going at a high velocity, which you will be doing a lot of, and the hitbox is bigger than your character, so you will die without touching much of anything at all.

												Defy Gravity is a very short and simplistic puzzle platformer where you create gravity wells that either push or pull you. It's kind of like being in a magnetic suit and the gravity wells act as attractive and repulsive magnets. The gameplay is actually pretty good and the game does get progressively more challenging as you progress, but the early levels only take a matter of minutes to finish. I do like the old school feel to it and the save spots keep it from becoming overly frustrating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defy Gravity.....Hmm what can I say about defy gravity? Well how about this. It is absolutely an amazing 2D platformer. There are so many things done right in this game that an absolute TON of games could learn from. For instance difficulty range....there is none. You simply play the game. It forces you to think on your toes and truly tests your dexterity and reaction time all at the same time IN MID AIR. The title has no time limits and no life counter. However, it also comes at you with absolutely no mercy whatsoever. Below are the explanations. The shield - The shield mechanics in the game are also something I have personally have never seen before. You press S to toggle your shield or you can press Shift for a quick shield. However, the shield is not always your friend. Sometimes having the shield makes levels far more difficult because of the next mechanic on the list. Weapon - The weapon mechanic may remind some of you of Portal. However, instead of making portals, this weapon uses magnetic fields I guess you could call them. Left mouse button fires the blue orb which attracts you and anything non static also (including enemies). The right mouse button fires off the orange orb which you guessed it deflects you as well as other non static objects (including enemies).I strongly suggest picking this title up, in my opinion it is well worth the money. In fact it is worth more money that they are selling it for. Controls are simple, W or Space = Jump, A and D = Walk left or right and S or Shift = Shield.Pros: Instant Action.          Difficult without being too difficult to be fun.          A true test of skills with a keyboard and mouse.          Mechanics are truly unique, creative and they truly cause you to think of what your doing.Cons: Music can get a bit annoying especially when talking to friends on Skype, I found myself turning the volume down          through the mixer to the game itself.           Not enough options - I found no way to play in windowed mode or to turn the game audio down in game. I think          these would benefit the player more often than not.In conclusion: If you are looking for a TRUE platformer title that brings back the good ol' days of hard gaming this is your title. I hope everyone at least gives this game a shot, you will not be dissapointed.          ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a little game, yes, but it's interesting. I haven't seen anything like this before. You have gravity wells that reject or attract you and some other stuff. You also have a shield that defends you from these effects which you can use to your own very big advantage. So you shoot those wells and go from one end of the level to the other, dying few or few hundred times in the process. Although it can get frustrating, it still is quite fun! So if you find it even a bit appealing, I'd say give it a go!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												This game barely works. Not just gameplay wise but launching it too. If you have two or monitors connected it will always start up on the secondary display. If you Alt+Tab out of the game the only way to get back to the game is to close it and restart it. The double jump seems to randomly go off when I try to do 1 jump (May be an issue with keyboard) and later on in the game there is now sense of direction for where to place your grav wells and you're just left guessing while bouncing off gold orb things. majority of issues do come from a technical stand point but another complaint is that the difficulty curve kinda goes all over the place with some levels given you too many checkpoints and some giving too few. The only reason I managed to beat one level is because on the way back to the start of the level to get to the exit I managed to jump through the ray beam that was supposed to be chasing me. If the Dev fixes these issues (Again mainly technical) I will give the game another try but right now it's just a pain to play			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recently Defy Gravity was only 18c on Steam! I bought it not expecting much for that price (see Zombie Zoeds).Let's just say I was pleasently suprised. Defy Gravity isn't just a generic platformer, it has a unique twist in which you have a gun that you can shoot to either create a Repel or Attract blast.

												The Opposite of Portal but it is fun. Its a mix of parkour and a system of repeling and attracting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this at 90% off and just sold the steam trading cards.  The game itself looks like a student project and I didn't play much of it to be honest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am not a fan of platformers, but this one has some potential as an interesting platformer for the avid platformer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Baddest game.Good card price.Buy when under 90% sale.---------------------------------------------Sorry for a bad review. I've decided that for an indy game like this, the game looks okay. But the price is not reasonable, anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked this game up on sale for £0.09 for a laugh-and boy, did I get more than I was expecting.The soundtrack was pretty damn awesome, so a thumbs up for that.Also, this is a pretty challenging platformer-you have to think on your feet, especially in hard mode.While not the best game I've ever played, It's a solid platformer, and will give any platforming fan at least a few hours of fun.And if it's on sale again, get it. You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just have a soft spot for most games made using XNA this was on such game. I beat it back on XBOX 360 when it was in the indie sections.It had some solid mechanics like any platformer should.If you like platformers that focus on using magnetic fields or manipulating gravity holes check it out it's pretty cheap. Also space/sci-fi themes are nice too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defy Gravity is exactly what I look for in a game like this; It's challenging, but not too challenging; it's not super repetitive (it may be a little bit repetitive at times). Overall, it's a pretty good way to kill time and have fun doing it. The game's pretty short though, so I recommend waiting until goes on sale. (At the time of this review, I managed to get it for 14 cents, so...)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was better than I expected.One of the best and most interesting platformers I have recently played .9,7/10Definitely recommended!....ALSO! one more thing I loved in this game is that it has checkpoints at all the places that you need them...unlike some other platformers... :3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After A short play I am positvely surprised.This game is challenging but not to a degree that it makes you loose interest.Might get repetitive once I spend ~ 10h on it but seeing as I dropped 0,11€ the time/money value is equivalent to a 60€ title being played ~800h			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
